https://openalex.org/W2092721126,"The microvasculature consists of endothelial cells and their surrounding pericytes. Few studies on the regulatory mechanisms of tumour angiogenesis have focused on pericytes. Here we report the identification of tumour-derived PDGFRbeta (+) (platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta) progenitor perivascular cells (PPCs) that have the ability to differentiate into pericytes and regulate vessel stability and vascular survival in tumours. A subset of PDGFRbeta (+) PPCs is recruited from bone marrow to perivascular sites in tumours. Specific inhibition of PDGFRbeta signalling eliminates PDGFRbeta (+) PPCs and mature pericytes around tumour vessels, leading to vascular hyperdilation and endothelial cell apoptosis in pancreatic islet tumours of transgenic Rip1Tag2 mice."

https://openalex.org/W2087967916,"Fanconi anemia is a genetic disease characterized by genomic instability and cancer predisposition. Nine genes involved in Fanconi anemia have been identified; their products participate in a DNA damage-response network involving BRCA1 and BRCA2 (refs. 2,3). We previously purified a Fanconi anemia core complex containing the FANCL ubiquitin ligase and six other Fanconi anemia-associated proteins. Each protein in this complex is essential for monoubiquitination of FANCD2, a key reaction in the Fanconi anemia DNA damage-response pathway. Here we show that another component of this complex, FAAP250, is mutant in individuals with Fanconi anemia of a new complementation group (FA-M). FAAP250 or FANCM has sequence similarity to known DNA-repair proteins, including archaeal Hef, yeast MPH1 and human ERCC4 or XPF. FANCM can dissociate DNA triplex, possibly owing to its ability to translocate on duplex DNA. FANCM is essential for monoubiquitination of FANCD2 and becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA damage. Our data suggest an evolutionary link between Fanconi anemia-associated proteins and DNA repair; FANCM may act as an engine that translocates the Fanconi anemia core complex along DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2146739467,"Rip1 is required for IκB kinase activation in response to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and has been implicated in the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) response to double-stranded RNA. Cytokine production is impaired when rip1–/– cells are treated with TNF-α, poly(I-C), or lipopolysaccharide, implicating Rip1 in the Trif-dependent TLR3 and TLR4 pathways. To examine the role of Rip1 in the Trif-dependent TLR4 pathway, we generated rip1–/– MyD88–/– cells. Lipopolysaccharide failed to stimulate NF-κB activation in rip1–/–MyD88–/– cells, revealing that Rip1 is also required for the Trif-dependent TLR4-induced NF-κB pathway. In addition to activating NF-κB, TLR3/4 pathways also stimulate interferon regulatory factor 3 activation. However, we find that Rip1 expression stimulates NF-κB but not interferon regulatory factor 3 activity. In the TNF-α pathway, Rip1 interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Traf2 and is modified by polyubiquitin chains. Upon TLR3 activation, Rip1 is also modified by polyubiquitin chains and is recruited to TLR3 along with Traf6 and the ubiquitin-activated kinase Tak1. These studies suggest that Rip1 uses a similar, ubiquitin-dependent mechanism to activate IκB kinase-β in response to TNF-α and TLR3 ligands. Rip1 is required for IκB kinase activation in response to tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and has been implicated in the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) response to double-stranded RNA.

Upon recruitment to the TNF receptor (TNFR1), Rip1 is initially modified by K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. These K63-linked polyubiquitin chains are recognized by the ubiquitin receptor Tab2 (7Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol.

Recently, Rip1 has also been implicated in the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-mediated NF-κB response to dsRNA (8Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Rip1 interacts with the TLR3- and TLR4-specific adapter Trif (Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-β). Trif is a TIR domain-containing adapter protein that is essential for all signaling by TLR3 and some signaling by TLR4. Rip1 binds the C terminus of the Trif protein via a Rip homotypic interaction motif (8Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Trif also binds Traf6 (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6) and TBK-1 via its N terminus, and these interactions result in interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) activation. The TLR4 ligand LPS induces NF-κB activation by engaging the MyD88-dependent and Trif-dependent pathways. Thus, we reasoned that Rip1 may also participate in late phase NF-κB activation induced by TLR4 Trif-dependent pathway. We find NF-κB responses and cytokine production ablated when rip1–/– murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) or splenocytes are stimulated with dsRNA or TNF-α. Although the NF-κB responses to TLR4 appear unaffected due to activation of the MyD88-dependent pathway, LPS-induced cytokine production was impaired in the absence of Rip1. Importantly, LPS-induced NF-κB activation was completely ablated in rip1–/–MyD88–/– MEF, providing genetic evidence that Rip1 contributes to the Trif-dependent, TLR4-induced NF-κB pathway. Moreover, we find Rip1 phosphorylated and polyubiquitinated in TLR3-stimulated cells and demonstrate that Rip1, Traf6, and the ubiquitin-activated kinase Tak1 are recruited to TLR3 in response to poly(I-C) treatment. Taken together, these studies suggest that Rip1 may use similar ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms to activate IKK-β in TLR3-stimulated cells. Generation of rip1–/– and rip1–/–MyD88–/– Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts—Rip1+/– mice were interbred, females were sacrificed between embryonic days 15.5 and 17, and MEF were prepared as described in Ref. 1Kelliher M.A. Grimm S.

The MyD88–/– mice used for this study were backcrossed into the C57BL/6 background for 11 generations. To generate rip1–/–MyD88–/– MEF, rip1+/– mice were mated with MyD88–/– mice, and then rip1+/–MyD88+/– mice were intercrossed, and females were sacrificed to generate rip1+/+ or rip1+/–MyD88–/– or rip1–/–MyD88–/– MEF.

Real Time PCR—RNA from wild type and rip1–/– MEF was isolated, and cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript First Strand System (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using the DNA Engine-Opticon 2 PCR Machine (MJ Research). The reaction included 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, forward and reverse primer (10 μm), and the appropriate amount of cDNA. The thermal cycling parameter was 95 °C for 15 min, 95 °C for 15 s, 58.5 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s for 45 cycles followed by 72 °C for 10 min. The primers for real time PCR were murine IFN-β (5′-AGC TCC AAG AAA GGA CGA ACA T-3′), murine IFN-β (3′-GCC CTG TAG GTG AG TTG ATC T-5′); murine β-actin (5′-TTG AAC ATG GCA TTG TTA CCA A-3′); and murine β-actin (3′-TGG CAT AGA GGT CTT TAC GGA-5′). Transfection Assays—HEK 293 cells (1.5 × 104 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates and transfected on the following day with 40 ng of luciferase reporter genes (NF-κB, ISRE, or Viperin promoter) using Genejuice (Novagen). The Renilla luciferase reporter gene (Promega) was cotransfected for normalization. In all cases, cell lysates were prepared, and reporter gene activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Data are expressed as the mean relative stimulation ± S.D. for a representative experiment from three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HEK293 cells stably transfected with FLAG-tagged human TLR3 left unstimulated or treated with poly(I-C) (100 μg/ml) were lysed in endogenous lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and associated proteins were detected by immunoblotting with anti-Rip1, -Traf6, or -Tak1 antibodies. To measure NF-κB activity, wild type or rip1–/– MEF were left untreated or stimulated with IL-1α (10 ng/ml), TNF-α (10 ng/ml), or TLR ligands poly(I-C) (100 μg/ml), purified LPS (100 ng/ml), peptidoglycan, or MALP2 or infected with Sendai virus, and total cell lysates were examined for evidence of phosphorylated IκBα using a phosphospecific IκBα antibody (Cell Signaling). To ensure that an equivalent amount of total protein was examined, lysates were probed with either an IKK-α antibody (Santa Cruz) or anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase antibody. To measure TNF- and LPS-induced NF-κB activation in the rip1–/–MyD88–/– MEF, IκBα degradation was measured by probing equivalent amounts of total protein with an anti-IκBα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Polyubiquitinated Rip1 was detected by stimulating the RAW264.7 macrophage or U373 astrocytoma cell lines with poly(I-C) or TNF-α and immunoprecipitating the lysates with anti-Rip1 antibody, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. Rip1 Mediates the Trif-dependent NF-κB Pathway—Recently, the Rip1 protein has been implicated in the innate immune response to double-stranded RNA viruses (8Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 12Balachandran S. Thomas E. Barber G.N. Nature. 2004; 432: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack Rip1 fail to activate NF-κB when stimulated with poly(I-C) (8Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar); however, the response to other Toll-like ligands has not been examined. To test whether Rip1, like Rip2, mediates multiple Toll-like receptor pathways, we treated wild type and rip1–/– MEF with IL-1α, poly(I-C), purified LPS, and the TLR2 ligand peptidoglycan. To measure NF-κB activity, we assayed cell lysates for phosphorylated IκBα by immunoblotting. As expected, we found poly(I-C)-induced NF-κB activation impaired in rip1–/– MEF (8Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) yet observed normal NF-κB responses when rip1–/– cells were stimulated with TLR2 or TLR4 ligands (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, the NF-κB responses to Toll-like receptor 2 and 4 ligands appear unaffected by a Rip1 deficiency (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that, unlike Rip2, Rip1 may only mediate the Trif-dependent pathways. The lack of TLR3 responsiveness in rip1–/– MEF could reflect decreased TLR3 expression in Rip1-deficient cells. Thus, we examined wild type and rip1–/– MEF for expression of TLR3 and TLR4 using reverse transcription-PCR. We found similar TLR3 and TLR4 expression levels in wild type and rip1–/– cells (not shown), suggesting that the TLR3 signaling defect is not due to decreased TLR3 receptor levels in Rip1-deficient cells. Decreased IFN-β and RANTES Production in Poly(I-C)-stimulated rip1–/– Cells—To foster antiviral responses, TLR3 and TLR4 activate the transcription factors NF-κB and IRF-3 and induce IFN-β expression. The transcriptional enhancer of the IFN-β promoter contains four positive regulatory domains, which function cooperatively to induce IFN-β expression in response to viral infection. The transcription factors that regulate IFN-β expression include NF-κB, IRF-3, and the ATF-2-c-Jun heterodimer (9Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 13Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Thus, the initial induction of IFN-β expression requires the activation of NF-κB, yet in our previous published studies, we observed induction of IFN-β in poly(I-C)-treated rip1–/– cells (8Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Since these studies were performed using reverse transcription-PCR (13Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), we reexamined IFN-β expression in poly(I-C)-stimulated rip1–/– MEF using quantitative real time PCR. At early time points, induction of IFN-β expression was observed in poly(I-C)-stimulated, wild type MEF but not in rip1–/– MEF stimulated with poly(I-C) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, late phase (24-h) IFN-β expression appears less affected, although expression remained significantly reduced in poly(I-C)-treated rip1–/– MEF (Fig. 2A). Similarly, RANTES production was reduced when rip1–/– cells were stimulated with either poly(I-C) or TNF-α (Fig. 2B). However, cytokine production was unaffected when rip1–/– MEF were infected with Sendai virus, a single-stranded RNA virus, that induces IFN-β expression via a Trif- and TLR3-independent pathway (14Li K. Chen Z. Kato N. Gale Jr., M. Lemon S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16739-16747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Rip1 contributes to anti-viral responses mediated by TLR3 but is not required for NF-κB activation by the intracellular retinoic acid-inducible gene I pathway (15Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar). Decreased RANTES Production When rip1–/– Splenocytes Are Stimulated with Purified LPS—Although Rip1 has been shown to interact with the TLR3 and TLR4 adapter Trif, cytokine responses to poly(I-C) or purified LPS were not examined in our previous study (8Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Thus, Rip1 may contribute to NF-κB activation when MEF are treated with poly(I-C) but may not contribute significantly to cytokine production in vivo, particularly when the TLR4 pathway is stimulated, since NF-κB can be activated by the MyD88-dependent pathway. Due to the lethality associated with a Rip1 deficiency (1Kelliher M.A. Grimm S. Ishida Y. Kuo F. Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Immunity. 1998; 8: 297-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar), we were unable to examine TLR3/4 responses in Rip1-deficient macrophages or dendritic cells. To evaluate the contribution of Rip1 to TLR3- and TLR4-induced innate immune responses, we stimulated neonatal day 2 splenocytes from rip1–/–tnfr1–/– mice and control littermates with poly(I-C), purified LPS, or TNF-α. We found RANTES production significantly reduced when neonatal rip1–/–tnfr1–/– splenocytes are stimulated with poly(I-C) and LPS (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that Rip1 contributes to both the Trif-dependent TLR3 and TLR4 pathways and demonstrate that activation of both the Trif-Rip1 and MyD88-dependent TLR4 pathways is required for robust cytokine production. Rip1 Mediates the Trif-dependent TLR4 Pathway—The decreased cytokine responses to the TLR4 ligand LPS observed in rip1–/– MEF and splenocytes suggested that Rip1 may also mediate the Trif-dependent, TLR4-induced NF-κB pathway. To test this possibility, we mated our rip1+/– mice with MyD88–/– mice (generously provided by S. Akira) and then stimulated wild type, rip1+/+MyD88–/–, or rip1+/–MyD88–/– and rip1–/–MyD88–/– MEF with TNF-α or LPS and examined cytokine-induced IκBα degradation. TNF-α-induced IκBα degradation was observed in wild type cells and in rip1+/+ MyD88–/– 10 min following cytokine treatment (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, no TNF-α-induced IκBα degradation is observed in the double knockout rip1–/–MyD88–/– cells due to the absence of Rip1 (Fig. 4C). Wild type MEF exhibit IκBα degradation 15 min following LPS treatment, whereas IκBα degradation is delayed in rip1+/+MyD88–/– cells with evidence of IκBα degradation detected between 45 min and 1 h poststimulation (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, no LPS-induced IκBα degradation was observed in cells deficient for both Rip1 and MyD88 even at 120 min following LPS treatment (Fig. 4C). The double knock out cells failed to respond to TNF-α, LPS, and poly(I-C) but remained capable of activating NF-κB in response to treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin (not shown). These studies provide genetic evidence that Rip1 contributes to the Trif-dependent TLR4-induced NF-κB pathway. Rip1 Expression Stimulates NF-κB but Not IRF-3 Activation—The presence of a Rip homotypic interaction domain in Trif and Rip1 suggests that Rip1 and Trif may interact to mediate both NF-κB and IRF-3 activation. Deletion of the Rip homotypic interaction motif in Trif ablates Trif-mediated NF-κB activation but has no effect on IRF-3 activation (8Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). To test whether Rip1 can stimulate both NF-κB and IRF-3 activation, we transfected HEK293 cells with a NF-κB or IRF reporter constructs (ISG54 and ISRE) with expression plasmids containing p65 (RelA), Rip1, or Trif or with a constitutively active IRF-3 expression construct, the phosphomimetic IRF3-5D. Twenty-four hours later, luciferase reporter gene activity was measured. RelA, Rip1, and Trif expression all stimulated NF-κB reporter activity (Fig. 5A), yet only Trif and IRF3-5D were capable of stimulating IRF-3-dependent reporter activity (ISRE reporter (Fig. 5B) and Viperin reporter (Fig. 5C)). This experiment suggests that Rip1 may not participate in the Trif-dependent IRF-3 pathway and is recruited by Trif to mediate IKK-β activation. LPS- and Poly(I-C)-induced Cytokine Production Is Diminished in traf6–/– MEF—The MyD88-dependent NF-κB pathway is mediated by the recruitment of IRAK kinases and Traf6 and the Tak1-Tab1-Tab2 complex. Thus, we reasoned that Traf6 may also contribute to the Trif-dependent NF-κB pathway. To test this possibility, we stimulated wild type and traf6–/– MEF with TLR ligand poly(I-C) or LPS or with TNF-α and examined IKK activity using a phospho-IκBα antibody. In contrast to wild type MEF, traf6–/– MEF responded only to TNF-α and failed to phosphorylate IκBα when stimulated with TLR3 or TLR4 ligands (Fig. 6A). Culture supernatants were also harvested 24 h post-stimulation, and RANTES production was measured by ELISA (Fig. 6B). NF-κB activation and cytokine production in response to TLR2, -3, and -4 ligands was ablated in traf6–/– MEF, whereas TNF-induced IKK activation and cytokine production remained unaffected by a Traf6 deficiency (Fig. 6, A and B). Taken together, these studies suggest that Traf6 and Rip1 contribute to the Trif-dependent TLR3 and TLR4 NF-κB pathways. Rip1, Traf6, and Tak1 Are Recruited to TLR3 upon Poly(I-C) Stimulation—Our data suggest that Rip1 and Traf6 proteins contribute to the Trif-dependent NF-κB pathway. To test whether the endogenous proteins are recruited to TLR3 upon receptor activation, we stimulated HEK 293 that express a FLAG-tagged TLR3 with poly(I-C) for 30, 60, and 120 min. We immunoprecipitated TLR3 using the anti-FLAG antibody and tested whether Rip1 or Traf6 associated with TLR3. We detected Rip1 and Traf6 recruitment to TLR3 30 min following poly(I-C) treatment (Fig. 7, A and B). We also examined the TLR3-associated proteins for evidence of Tak1 recruitment. Tak1 recruitment to TLR3 was observed at 60 min when maximal phosphorylated IκBα protein is also detected (Fig. 7C). Interestingly, Rip1 and Traf6 recruitment appears to precede Tak1 recruitment, suggesting that Traf6 may modify Rip1 and thereby signal Tak1 recruitment. Rip1 Is Phosphorylated and Polyubiquitinated in TLR3-stimulated Cells—We have shown that the kinase activity of Rip1 is responsive to TNFR1 activation (6Lee T.H. Shank J. Cusson N. Kelliher M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33185-33191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), suggesting that the kinase activity of Rip1 is responsive to specific ligands or stresses. Studies in cells expressing kinase-inactive Rip1 have revealed that Rip1 autophosphorylation is induced in TNF-α-stimulated cells (6Lee T.H. Shank J. Cusson N. Kelliher M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33185-33191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8, A and B). Similarly, the related Rip2 kinase and IRAK kinases are responsive to TLR and IL-1 receptor activation (16Janssens S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). To provide additional evidence that Rip1 responds to TLR3/4 activation, we stimulated wild type cells with TNF-α or with the TLR ligand LPS or poly(I-C) and examined cell lysates for phosphorylated Rip1. As expected, phosphorylated Rip1 was detected as early as 5 min following TNF-α treatment. We find Rip1 autophosphorylation also rapidly induced upon poly(I-C) treatment or LPS treatment (Fig. 8, A and B). These studies reveal that the Rip1 kinase activity responds to TNFR1, TLR3, and TLR4 activation and further implicates Rip1 in a TLR3 and TLR4 Trif-dependent pathway. In addition to phosphorylation, TNF-α stimulates the conjugation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on Rip1 (6Lee T.H. Shank J. Cusson N. Kelliher M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33185-33191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 17Legler D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.A. Tschopp J. Bron C.

K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on Rip1, Traf6, or IKK-γ (NEMO) are recognized by the ubiquitin receptor protein Tab2, a component of the ubiquitin-activated Tak1 complex (7Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Thus, Rip1 may use similar mechanisms to mediate IKK-β activation in TNF-α- and TLR3- or TLR4-stimulated cells. To test this possibility, we stimulated the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and the U373 astrocytoma line with TNF-α for 10 min or treated the cells with poly(I-C) for 30, 60, or 120 min. We immunoprecipitated Rip1 from the untreated and treated cells and examined the lysates for polyubiquitinated Rip1 protein by immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. We observed evidence of Rip1 polyubiquitination in both the poly(I-C) and TNF-α-treated cell lysates (Fig. 8C), suggesting that polyubiquitinated Rip1 may contribute to IKK-β activation in both the TNFR1 and TLR3 pathway. It remains unclear whether Rip1 is modified by K63-linked and/or K48-linked polyubiquitin chains in the TLR3-stimulated cells; however, Rip1 degradation does not appear induced in the poly(I-C)-treated cells, suggesting that Rip1 may be modified by K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Moreover, the recruitment of Traf6 and Tak1 would support the idea that K63-linked polyubiquitinated Rip1 stimulates IKK-β activation in TLR3/4-stimulated cells. These studies provide genetic and biochemical evidence that Rip1 is an essential mediator of the TLR3 and TLR4 NF-κB responses and suggest that the Trif-dependent NF-κB pathway may be mediated by polyubiquitinated Rip1 and the ubiquitin-activated Tak1 complex. The TLR3 and TLR4 pathways employ the adapter protein Trif that signals both NF-κB and IRF-3 activation. Trif recruits Traf6 and TBK-1 via its N terminus, and TBK-1 is responsible for IRF-3 phosphorylation and activation (11Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how Trif activates the IKK-β and JNK2 pathways. Data base screening for proteins containing regions homologous to Trif revealed that Trif-induced NF-κB activation may be mediated by Rip1 (8Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Studies in Rip1-deficient MEF then confirmed defects in poly(I-C)-induced NF-κB activation, implicating Rip1, a mediator of TNF-α-induced IKK activation, in the Trif-dependent NF-κB pathway (8Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In this study, we address the biologic contribution of Rip1 to innate immune responses by examining poly(I-C)- and LPS-induced cytokine production in rip1–/– MEF and splenocytes. Consistent with the published studies on Trif-deficient and MyD88-deficient cells (20Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar, 21Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar), we find poly(I-C)- and LPS-induced cytokine production impaired in Rip1-deficient MEF and splenocytes. Taken together, these studies support the model that TLR4-induced cytokine responses to bacterial pathogens require activation of both the Trif-dependent and MyD88-dependent pathways. The involvement of Rip1 in the Trif-dependent TLR3 NF-κB pathway suggested that Rip1 may also contribute to the Trif-dependent TLR4-induced NF-κB activation. Consistent with this idea, we find that LPS, like TNF-α and poly(I-C), stimulates the kinase activity of Rip1, and we find LPS-induced cytokine levels diminished in rip1–/– cells. To test the contribution of Rip1 to the Trif-dependent TLR4 NF-κB pathway, we generated rip1–/–MyD88–/– cells and stimulated them with either TNF-α or LPS. As expected, NF-κB activation is delayed in LPS-treated rip1+/+MyD88–/– cells; however, in the absence of both MyD88 and Rip1, LPS-induced NF-κB activation is not observed. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that Rip1 is responsive to TLR4 activation and demonstrates that Rip1 mediates both the Trif-dependent TLR3 and TLR4 NF-κB pathways. Interestingly, the dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR has also been implicated in poly(I-C)-induced NF-κB activation and in apoptotic responses to poly(I-C), TNF-α, and LPS (22Der S.D. Yang Y.L.

Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that dsRNA-induced NF-κB activation may involve PKR and Rip1. Consistent with this model, Li and co-workers (24Jiang Z. Zamanian-Daryoush M. Nie H. Silva A.M. Williams B.R. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16713-16719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) find PKR recruited to Trif upon poly(I-C) stimulation. However, unlike PKR-deficient cells that are resistant to poly(I-C)- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis, Rip1-deficient cells are sensitive to TNF-α- and poly(I-C)-induced cell death, suggesting that Rip1 and PKR have opposing functions in the TNF-α- and dsRNA-activated pathways. 3G. Wen and M. A. Kelliher, unpublished data. We demonstrate that, like TNFR1 activation, TLR3 activation stimulates Rip1 recruitment and Rip1 polyubiquitination. In TNF-α-treated cells, ubiquitin chain conjugation is mediated by the Ubc13-Uev1a complex and facilitated by Traf2, the E3 ubiquitin ligase recruited to the TNFR1 that also interacts with Rip1 (6Lee T.H.

We find TLR3 and TLR4 responses diminished in traf6–/– cells and observe ligand-dependent recruitment of Rip1, Traf6, and Tak1 to TLR3 (Fig. 7). Our studies suggest that Traf6 also contributes to TLR3/4-induced antimicrobial responses. Traf6 has been shown by others to be recruited to TLR3 and bind Trif (24Jiang Z. Zamanian-Daryoush M. Nie H.

Matsumura T. Inoue J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Rip1 polyubiquitination is induced upon TNF-α or poly(I-C) treatment of cells, suggesting that Rip1 may use similar mechanisms to activate NF-κB in the TNFR1- and Trif-dependent TLR pathways. Thus, polyubiquitinated Rip1 may be recognized by the Tab2 protein (7Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), a component of the Tak1 complex, and thereby, the ubiquitin-activated kinase Tak1 may be recruited to the TLR3. Consistently, we find Traf6 and Tak1 recruited to TLR3, and we find TLR3/4-induced cytokine production ablated in traf6–/– cells. Additionally, TLR3 and TLR4 NF-κB and IRF-3 responses have been shown to be negatively regulated by the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20 (27Boone D.L. Turer E.E. Lee E.G. Ahmad R.C. Wheeler M.T.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Parallels can also be made to Drosophila melanogaster, where the Imd protein, the mammalian counterpart to Rip1, mediates the antimicrobial immune response to Gram-negative bacteria. Imd is required for activation of Drosophila Tak1 and acts through a pathway that includes the Drosophila IκB kinase complex (30Silverman N. Zhou R. Stoven S. Pandey N. Hultmark D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2461-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that Imd signaling requires the fly homologues of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc13/Uev1A 4Zhou, R., Silverman, N., Hog, M., Liao, D. S., Chung, Y., Chen, Z. J., and Maniatis, T. (2005) J. Biol. Chem.280, 34048–34055. and a Drosophila homologue of the human Tab2 protein. A Drosophila Tab2 mutant that is defective in activating the Imd pathway contains a nonsense mutation in the C-terminal zinc finger domain that recognizes K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. 5D. Ferrandon, personal communication. Thus, the antimicrobial response and mechanism of IKK activation in flies and mammals appear highly conserved and may be dependent on the ubiquitin modification of Rip1 and potentially Imd.

Our sequencing of the complete 1,395,502 base pair genome of Dehalococcoides strain CBDB1 has revealed the presence of 32 reductive-dehalogenase-homologous (rdh) genes, possibly conferring on the bacteria an immense dehalogenating potential. Most rdh genes were associated with genes encoding transcription regulators such as two-component regulatory systems or transcription regulators of the MarR-type. Four new paralog groups of rdh-associated genes without known function were detected. Comparison with the recently sequenced genome of Dehalococcoides ethenogenes strain 195 reveals a high degree of gene context conservation (synteny) but exceptionally high plasticity in all regions containing rdh genes, suggesting that these regions are under intense evolutionary pressure."

Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3930) Google Scholar) found in various mammalian tissues. Proteolytic processing of APP in human brain may give rise to the Aβ peptide, which is the major constituent of amyloid plaques in brains of patients suffering from Alzheimer disease (2Selkoe D.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 3Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5135) Google Scholar). APP is a substrate for at least 3 proteolytic (“secretase”) activities (4De Strooper B. Annaert W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) designated α, β, and γ. The major proteolytic pathway, undertaken by ∼95% of the APP in neurons, is α-γ, i.e. APP is first cleaved by a α-secretase within the Aβ region, and consequently by the γ-secretase. The second proteolytic pathway, which leads to the formation of Aβ, is the β-γ pathway. In this case, APP is first cleaved by the β-secretase (BACE, beta-site amyloid cleaving enzyme (5Hussain I. Powell D. Howlett D.R. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Gloger I.S. Murphy K.E. Southan C.D. Ryan D.M. Smith T.S. Simmons D.L. Walsh F.S. Dingwall C. Christie G. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) to allow further processing by the γ-secretase to produce the 4-kDa Aβ peptide. Even though it is not the β-cleavage itself that would per se lead to the plaque formation, but rather the misfolding and aggregation of the generated peptide, up-regulation of the β-secretase activity is an issue in amyloidogenesis. Hence it is necessary to establish how access of the secretases to APP is regulated, and how are the proteolytic activities of the individual secretases modulated. One obvious way of restricting a contact between two different membrane proteins is confining them into distinct cellular compartments, and/or possibly dispatching them to separate trafficking routes. To a certain extent, access of BACE and other secretases to APP may be limited in this way (both APP and BACE cycle between the cell surface and intracellular membrane compartments). Because trafficking largely relies on interacting proteins responsible for sorting, modifying (e.g. phosphorylation), and “packing” of the cargo, these are also candidates for involvement in β-cleavage regulation (6Russo T. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Zambrano N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 434: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7He X. Chang W.P. Koelsch G. Tang J. FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Another way to restrict contact between two different membrane proteins is by differential partitioning into distinct membrane microdomains, lipid rafts (8Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8052) Google Scholar). Indeed, rafts had already been implicated in APP processing (9Ehehalt R. Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Decreased levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids, both of which are indispensable constituents of lipid rafts, correlate with reduced β-cleavage (9Ehehalt R. Keller P. Haass C. Thiele C. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), whereas exogenously added cholesterol seems to decrease α-cleavage (10Bodovitz S. Klein W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4436-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar); also ceramides, which have been suggested to play a role in subdomain organization and raft coalescence, were proposed as β-cleavage modulators (11Puglielli L. Ellis B.C. Saunders A.J. Kovacs D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19777-19783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Besides, mutant BACE linked to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, which enhances its association with detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), seems to cleave APP more efficiently than the wild type BACE (12Cordy J.M.

There is a large body of experimental work done on cells in culture as well as ex vivo concerning partitioning of APP and BACE into DRMs (13Rouvinski A. Gahali-Sass I. Stav I. Metzer E. Atlan H.

Despite the usefulness of probing DRM association in early stages of characterization of the proteins, and especially for detecting changes in interactions of membrane components, this type of experimental approach cannot provide adequate insight into raft connections to APP processing. Possibilities to manipulate lipid composition of the cell membranes are limited, and often do not deliver clear-cut results because the risk of secondary effects is high (disruption of the SNARE clusters required for exocytosis (17Lang T.

In addition, β-secretase activity is likely to be regulated by direct modulation of the enzymatic activity of BACE. One such regulatory factor is the pH of the surrounding aqueous environment; another mechanism engages membrane lipids, either directly interacting with BACE as cofactors or costructures, or simply providing optimal bulk membrane properties. In this paper we therefore set about to characterize the lipid requirements for β-cleavage in an artificial, reconstituted system composed of purified proteins and defined lipids. Our data demonstrate that lipids directly regulate proteolytic activity of BACE. Reagents—Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids as chloroform solutions or in powder form, and were used without further purification. Gangliosides, PC, PE, PS, and cerebrosides were from porcine brain, whereas PA was from egg PC, and PI from bovine liver. POPC and DOPC were synthetic. Triton X-100 was from Fluka, and dodecylmaltoside and HEGA10 detergents were acquired from Anatrace. OptiPrep density gradient media was from Axis-Shield (Oslo, Norway). Cell culture media and the NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gels were from Invitrogen. IgG-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow, glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the amino-reactive dye CY5 was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and the DiO fluorescent lipid analog as well as Alexa 488-cholera toxin subunit B conjugate were from Molecular Probes. All other chemicals were from Sigma and Merck. The recombinant human BACE ectodomain was from Oncogene, and the fluorogenic soluble peptide substrate for BACE (FS-1) was purchased from Bachem. Rabbit polyclonal antibody 7523 against BACE ectodomain was a kind gift from Christian Haass. Constructs, Primers, and Baculovirus Generation—Human wile type BACE1a was amplified by PCR with primers the introducing NcoI (containing initial ATG) site at the 5′ (CGTAGGCCATGGCCCAAGCCCTGCCCTGGCTC) end and XhoI at the 3′ end (GGAATTCTTAGCTCGAGCCCTTAAGCAGGGAGATGTCATCAGC). BACE was fused to a C-terminal TAP tag via a protease-resistant linker of the sequence (SSGPSGS) followed by the PreScission protease cleavage site (LEVLFQ|GP). The overall modular structure of the construct was thus BACE-linker-PreScission-TAP, which was cloned into the pFastBac vector (Invitrogen) under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. The recombinant baculovirus was generated according to the manufacturer's instructions. BACE Expression and Purification—All buffers used throughout the procedure were based on 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.25, 150 mm NaCl (HBS). The SF+ (Protein Sciences) cells were grown in suspension in a serumfree medium (SF900 II SFM) at 27 °C, and were infected with the recombinant baculovirus at the cell density of 1.5 × 10-6 cells/ml. The virus stock was roughly titrated by expression levels as judged from Western blotting. Cells were collected by centrifugation (30 min, 400 × g) 48 h post-infection, and frozen and stored at -80 °C. BACE was purified from isolated membranes of the collected cells. Cells were homogenized in the presence of protease inhibitors (chymostatin, 6 mg/ml; leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml; antipain 10 μg/ml; aprotinin, 2 μg/ml; pepstatin, 0.7 μg/ml; 4-aminophenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml; and E64, 0.1 mm) in HBS buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose in a hand-held glass homogenizer (20–30 strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged at ∼100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the resulting pellet was resuspended with the help of the glass homogenizer in HBS + 1% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside, supplemented with protease inhibitors. The lysate was incubated at room temperature with stirring for ∼30 min, followed by centrifugation at ∼100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was immediately loaded on an equilibrated IgG-Sepharose column (1.5-ml beads for 1-liter cell cultures) and washed with 10 column volumes of the running buffer (RB) (HBS + 5% glycerol, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.6), 1 column volume of RB + 5 mm ATP, 2 column volumes of RB, 2 column volumes of RB 2 mm EDTA, and finally 5 column volumes of RB. The flow was then stopped and ∼150 μl of the PreScission protease (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the beads, mixed, and incubated either 3–4 h at room temperature or 12–16 h at 4 °C. The tagless protein was then eluted at a concentration of 0.25–0.5 mg/ml with RB supplemented with 10–50% glycerol. To remove the PreScission protease (glutathione S-transferase-tagged), the eluate was incubated with glutathione transferase beads for ∼30 min, and the beads were removed by centrifugation. Purified BACE was stored at 4 °C, or mixed with 50% glycerol and stored at -20 °C, or frozen in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles (LUVs)—Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared from a hydrated suspension of multilamellar vesicles by extrusion. Briefly, lipids were mixed in chloroform in a borosilicate glass test tube, and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen for ∼1 h. The dry lipid film (which was consequently left under vacuum when the original volume of organic solvent was greater than 200 μl) was then hydrated with the LUV buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 7.25), which was preheated to or above Tm of the lipid mixture. Hydration was carried out at or above the Tm with occasional vortexing for at least 30 min, or until the suspension appeared homogenous. The resulting suspension was subjected to 3–4 freeze-thaw cycles, and finally extruded through 100-nm pore diameter polycarbonate membrane using the Avanti mini-extruder. Reconstitution of BACE to Form Proteoliposomes—Typically, LUVs were diluted to ∼1 mg/ml, and the HEGA10 detergent was added to the final concentration corresponding to the “onset of solubilization” (23Rigaud J.L. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which was determined by turbidity measurements. Typically, this value would be ∼0.26% (w/v), differing slightly for each lipid mixture. The liposomes were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature to allow the detergent to equilibrate between the aqueous phase and the liposomes, and consequently, concentrated BACE (0.25–0.5 mg/ml in 0.4–0.5% Triton X-100 and 10–50% glycerol) was added at a protein to lipid ratio 1:70 to 1:150 (w/w). The Triton X-100 concentration was maintained safely below the critical micellular concentration of Triton X-100 (typically <0.008%). The mixture was then incubated at 32 °C with shaking for 15–45 min, and consequently for ∼5 min at room temperature before loading on a Sephadex G-50 column of appropriate dimensions. The size of the column was determined empirically using liposomes with HEGA detergent, so that good separation of liposomes from HEGA detergent was ensured (as little as 0.01% HEGA can be detected using the BCA reagent). 3L. Kalvodova and K. Simons, unpublished observation. The proteoliposomes were collected (turbid fractions), adjusted to 12–20% iodixanol, and under-layered under the 2.5 and 5% iodixanol layers in an ultra-clear tube of an appropriate size depending on the final volume. Gradients in 11 × 34-mm tubes were centrifuged for 1 h and 15 min in a Beckman TLS55 rotor at 52 krpm at 4 °C; alternatively, 11 × 60-mm tubes were centrifuged in the Beckman SW60 rotor for 3 h at 42 krpm at 4 °C. Proteoliposomes would typically band at the 5/12% interface, or would be dispersed in the 5% layer. Empty liposomes would be mostly on the very top of the gradient. The band was collected and diluted at least 6-fold with LUV buffer, and the proteoliposomes were pelleted for at least 2 h, 38 krpm, at 4 °C in the Beckman TLA45 rotor. The supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellets were resuspended in LUV buffer and stored on ice for several weeks without a detectable change in BACE activity. Determination of BACE and Lipid Content in Proteoliposomes—An aliquot of the proteoliposomes was loaded on a NuPAGE BisTris 4–12% gel along with BACE mass standards, and run in MOPS buffer. The concentration was determined by densitometry after silver staining (useful range 15–200 ng of BACE/band). If desirable, lipid content was estimated from a TLC plate by comparing with appropriate standards. Proteinase K Treatment of Reconstituted Proteoliposomes—Three equivalent samples of proteoliposomes containing 450 ng of BACE in LUV were processed in the same way: 1) “treated,” proteoliposomes supplied with 10 mg of proteinase K; 2) “untreated,” non-digested sample, where proteinase K was omitted, to determine maximum possible recovery of the protein; and 3) solubilized sample supplied with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.45% Tween 20 4Specific activity of proteinase K in 0.5% Triton X-100 + 0.45% Tween 20 is comparable with detergent-free conditions (Qiagen product information). for determination of maximum digestion. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C, and the reaction was stopped by adding 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and placed on ice. Samples were pelleted at 42 krpm for 20 min in a TLA45 rotor at 4 °C, and supernatants and pellets were analyzed separately by Western blotting, using the 7523 antibody directed against the BACE ectodomain. Sodium Carbonate Treatment of Proteoliposomes—Integral membrane proteins are not extracted from the membrane when treated with 0.1 m Na2CO3 (21Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were treated with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.3, and floated in OptiPrep density gradient prepared in 0.1 m Na2CO3. Cholesterol Depletion from Proteoliposomes—Proteoliposomes were treated with ∼5 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 15 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking, and the activity assayed upon 5-fold dilution with assay buffer. As a control, BACE in Triton X-100 was treated likewise. Activity Assays—In a 96-well plate, typically 12.5 and 25 ng of BACE in proteoliposomes were adjusted to 30 μl with the LUV buffer, and the reaction was started by adding 70 μl of the reaction buffer (80 mm acetate buffer, pH 5, supplemented with 90 mm NaCl as an osmotic balancer) premixed with the FS-1 substrate (stock solution ∼250 mm in 1.5 m HAc). The final concentration of FS-1 was ∼8 mm, which was enough to saturate 200 ng of BACE in 0.025% Triton X-100, or 40 ng of BACE in total brain lipid proteoliposomes. The activity was determined from the linear region on the reaction progression curve (typically up to 1500 s) measured as fluorescence at 485 nm, excitation 355 nm, at 37 °C using the Ascent Fluoroskan CF reader. The reaction was followed for 4000 s in 40-s steps, with gentle shaking in between measurements. Preparation of GUVs with Incorporated BACE (“Proteo-GUVs”)—BACE was labeled with the amino-reactive (maleimide) dye CY5 directly in elution buffer, and the unreacted dye was separated on a Sephadex G-50 column. The efficiency of the labeling was ∼2 CY5 fluorophors/1 BACE molecule, and specific activity remained unchanged. CY5-BACE was reconstituted in LUVs (which when required were prepared with 0.05–0.1 mol % DiO) following the same procedure as with non-labeled BACE for activity assays, except that the reconstitution buffer was of 10-fold lower ionic strength (5 mm HEPES, 15 mm NaCl). After flotation in an OptiPrep gradient, proteoliposomes (proteo-LUVs) were pelleted (100,000 × g, 1 h) and resuspended in Milli-Q water containing 10 mm trehalose to a final lipid concentration of 20 to 50 mm. To form the proteo-GUVs, a recently developed reconstitution technique was used (22Kahya N. Brown D.A. Schwille P. Biochemistry. 2005; 20: 7479-7489Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The vesicle suspension was deposited onto ITO-coated coverslips and put in the vacuum at 4 °C overnight. During membrane de-hydration at low temperature, the vesicles underwent fusion and formed large patches of membranes. Liposomes were re-hydrated in water or 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, upon an alternate electric field in the flow chamber, as described previously for the GUVs preparation. After 3–4 h, numerous unilamellar vesicles formed, with a diameter varying between 10 and 150 μm. In the case of lipid mixtures of high phase-transition temperature, membranes were first re-hydrated under the electric field at 55 °C for 15 min and then cooled down for the following 2–3 h. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy and Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy—This information is presented in the supplemental data. Electron Microscopy—Sample was dried on a grid, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and quenched with glycine. For labeling, 7523 (C. Haass) antibody directed against the ectodomain was used together with 6-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibody. After labeling, the sample was fixed as before, washed, and stained with uranyl acetate. Expression and Purification of BACE—To prepare milligram amounts of active human BACE, we employed the baculovirus expression system along with the suspension-grown insect cell line Sf+, which is capable of performing post-translational modifications common in mammalian cells (palmitoylation and glycosylation). The polyhedrin promoter driven expression of BACE was first observed (as judged by Western blotting) at 40 h post-infection, and reached the highest levels at 48–60 h post-infection. More than 2 mg of homogenous (as judged by silver stained SDS-PAGE) preparation of tagless BACE, eluted at a concentration of 0.1–0.5 mg/ml, was obtained from 1 liter of 48-h post-infection culture (Fig. 1). Recovery and Specific Activity of BACE Reconstituted in Total Brain Lipid Vesicles—The detergent-mediated reconstitution procedure presented here relies on incorporation of protein into preformed liposomes (23Rigaud J.L. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2002; 35: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and yields BACE reconstituted directionally (>80% ectodomain outside, supplemental Fig. S2) in large unilamellar vesicles; the yield was typically 15–30% of protein input by weight. The sidedness of the insertion did not depend on the lipid composition of the vesicles. Stable membrane-spanning insertion of BACE was confirmed by treatment with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 11.3, followed by flotation in a density gradient. Virtually all BACE (as judged by silver stained SDS-PAGE) remained associated with the lipids (floating fraction, supplemental Fig. S3). In addition, we performed immunoelectron microscopy of the total brain lipid proteoliposomes. We observed vesicles ∼50–200 nm in diameter, heavily labeled with anti-BACE antibody (Fig. 2). Virtually all immunodetected BACE was found to be membrane associated. The specific activity of BACE reconstituted in total brain lipid vesicles was at least 3-fold higher than that of the purified BACE in 0.02% Triton X-100, as judged by cleavage of the soluble fluorogenic substrate, which mimics the cleavage site of the Swedish APP mutant. Proteoliposomes consisting of BACE and total brain lipids were characterized by high reconstitution efficiency, reproducible activity, and stability (activity remains unchanged for several months when stored at 4 °C). BACE reconstituted in total brain lipid liposomes was therefore chosen as a standard, and reconstitution in total brain lipid liposomes was always performed as a control together with other samples. In this paper, we express specific activity of BACE as a percentage of the specific activity determined for brain lipid proteoliposomes. Activity in Complex Lipid Mixtures—There are hundreds of lipid species present in cells, and the reasons for such diversity are poorly understood. One way to study this complexity is to analyze how lipids regulate activities of membrane proteins in a reconstituted system. We therefore dissected the total brain lipid extract, and attempted to elucidate which lipid species are responsible for supporting BACE activity. As a control, a mixture mimicking the total brain lipid extract was mixed from individual components based on the known glycerophospholipid composition (data from Avanti catalog) and estimated amounts (TLC) of SM, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol. The composition was as follows: PC:PE:SM:cerebrosides:cholesterol:gangliosides:PS:PA:PI (10:17:27:10:15:5:11:3:2, w/w). BACE activity in this mixture was determined to be 95 ± 12% of TBLE (total brain lipid extract). Because interpretation of the effects caused by a particular lipid species in complex lipid mixtures such as total brain lipids is problematic, we proceeded to investigate BACE activity in various simpler lipid mixtures of defined head group compositions, ranging from simple pseudobinary mixtures to more complicated mixtures of up to 6 components. Specific Activity of BACE Reconstituted in Glycerophospholipid and Glycerophospholipid:Cholesterol Vesicles—Glycerophospholipids are the most abundant phospholipids in living cells, of which phosphatidylcholine accounts typically for up to 50% in mammalian cells. Specific activity of BACE in pure PC (brain PC or synthetic POPC) vesicles was not determined because of extremely low recoveries (<5%). It was clear, however, that specific activity in PC vesicles was severalfold (at least 3–5-fold) lower than that of BACE in TBLE vesicles. Recoveries improved somewhat when cholesterol was included, therefore POPC:cholesterol (2:1, mol/mol), was used instead. Specific activity of BACE in POPC:cholesterol vesicles is ∼5-fold lower than in TBLE vesicles (Fig. 3). It has been shown that membrane proteins often require PE for activity, PE serving as a “chaperone” (28Bogdanov M. Sun J. Kaback H.R. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11615-11618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and, along with other “nonbilayer lipids,” PE seems to be important for maintaining the physical state of the bilayer, allowing the membrane to readily undergo local rearrangements in response to changes in external conditions (27van der Brink-van der Laan E. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, in the case of BACE, including 20% PE did not lead to any significant increase in BACE activity (26 ± 12% relative to TBLE, Fig. 3). On the other hand, there was a strong effect of negatively charged phospholipids on BACE activity. PC:PS (80:20, w/w) supported BACE activity to 58 ± 4% of TBLE, whereas mixtures of PC:PE:PS and PC:PE:PA (60:20:20, w/w) brought the specific activity of BACE virtually to the level of TBLE, resulting in 99 ± 9 and 135 ± 31% of TBLE activity, respectively (Fig. 3). Specific Activity of BACE Reconstituted in Vesicles Composed of Glycerophospholipids, (Glyco)sphingolipids, and Cholesterol—Sphingolipids and cholesterol are essential components of lipid rafts, and various pseudo-ternary mixtures of PC, SM, and cholesterol mixed at ratios that allow for ld-lo phase coexistence, have been shown to be useful to imitate lipid rafts. Specific activity of BACE in the lo phase forming mixture of PC:SM:cholesterol (1:1:1 or 2:2:1 mol/mol) did not dramatically differ from POPC:cholesterol, resulting in 29 ± 16% of TBLE activity. To assess the role of cholesterol in modulating membrane properties relevant to BACE activity, we used proteoliposomes consisting of PC:PE:SM:gangliosides supplied with increasing amounts of cholesterol (0, 7.5, and 15%, w/w) substituting for SM (25, 17.5, and 10% (w/w) final) to yield cholesterol:sphingolipid molar ratios of 0:0.4:2.5. There was an increase in BACE activity along with increasing cholesterol:sphingolipid molar ratios as follows: 18 ± 1% for PC:PE:SM:gangliosides (50:20: 25:5, w/w), 28 ± 1% for PC:PE:SM:gangliosides:cholesterol (50:20:17.5: 5:7.5, w/w), and 36 ± 1% TBLE for PC:PE:SM:gangliosides:choleste"

Antibodies against MIF are effective in experimental models of inflammation, and there is interest in strategies to inhibit its deleterious cytokine activities. Here we identify a mechanism of inhibiting MIF pro-inflammatory activities by targeting MIF tautomerase activity. We designed small molecules to inhibit this tautomerase activity; a lead molecule, “ISO-1 ((S,R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester),” significantly inhibits the cytokine activity in vitro. Moreover, ISO-1 inhibits tumor necrosis factor release from macrophages isolated from LPStreated wild type mice but has no effect on cytokine release from MIFdeficient macrophages. The therapeutic importance of the MIF inhibition by ISO-1 is demonstrated by the significant protection from sepsis, induced by cecal ligation and puncture in a clinically relevant time frame. These results identify ISO-1 as the first small molecule inhibitor of MIF proinflammatory activities with therapeutic implications and indicate the potential of the MIF active site as a novel target for therapeutic interventions in human sepsis.

These and other results indicate that inhibiting MIF is a promising approach to develop new anti-inflammatory agents.Three-dimensional x-ray crystallography of MIF shows that the molecule exists as a homotrimer (9Sugimoto H.

Tautomerase activity is an evolutionarily ancient phenomenon, which early life forms presumably utilized for synthesis, but there is no evidence that modern species use this in synthetic pathways. We reasoned that molecules that bind this site could be useful to target MIF function, because the tautomerase activity is expendable. We have designed a molecule to fit into the catalytic site and shown that (S,R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester (ISO-1) 2The abbreviations used are:ISO-1(S,R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl esterDMFdimethyl formamideFCCflash column chromatographyFL-ISO-1fluorescent derivative of ISO-1HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPBSphosphate-buffered salineDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleLPSlipopolysaccharideCLPcecal ligation and punctureNAPQIN-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTNFtumor necrosis factor. 2The abbreviations used are:ISO-1(S,R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl esterDMFdimethyl formamideFCCflash column chromatographyFL-ISO-1fluorescent derivative of ISO-1HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPBSphosphate-buffered salineDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleLPSlipopolysaccharideCLPcecal ligation and punctureNAPQIN-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayTNFtumor necrosis factor. is a potent inhibitor of MIF tautomerase activity (15Lubetsky J.B.

The crystal structure of MIF complexed to ISO-1 reveals that ISO-1 binds to the enzymatic active site.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll chemicals were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Succinimidyl ester of Rhodamine Red-X was purchased from Molecular Probes.Methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) was distilled from phosphorous pentoxide. Dimethyl formamide (DMF) was stored under argon in capped DriSolv™ bottles and used without further purification.Aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 with 254 nm fluorescent indicator TLC plates were used. Developed TLC plates were visualized under a short wave UV lamp, stained with an I2-SiO2 mixture, and/or by heating plates that were dipped in ninhydrin. Flash column chromatography (FCC) was performed using flash silica gel (32–63 μm) and usually employed a stepwise solvent polarity gradient, correlated with TLC mobility.All 1H and 13C spectra were recorded on a JOEL spectrometer at 270 MHz for the 1H NMR spectra and at 67.5 MHz for the 13C NMR spectra. Chemical shifts are relative to the deuterated solvent peak and are in parts per million. The coupling constants (J) are measured in Hertz. The signals are described as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), m (multiplet), and br s (broad singlet).

The supernatants were analyzed for the tautomerase activity of MIF using l-dopachrome methyl ester as follows (15Lubetsky J.B. Dios A. Han J. Aljabari B. Ruzsicska B. Mitchell R. Lolis E. Al-Abed Y.

After incubation with FL-ISO-1, the cells were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (5 min each wash) and fixed using 4% formaldehyde (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and stained with DAPI (20 ng/ml) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, mounted in 70% Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in dH2 O on a microscope slide and sealed using nail polish. Observation and imaging of the cells were carried out on an Olympus IX70 microscope using a 40× oil immersion objective and 568 nm (for FL-ISO-1) and 360 nm (for DAPI) excitation filters. Images were captured using a digital camera (Hamamatsu) and the ISee software program (Inovision).Measurement of NF-κB Activation by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—RAW 267.4 macrophages were treated with various concentrations of ISO-1 (1–100 μm) 30 min prior to LPS (endotoxin, Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma) addition. Macrophages were collected 2 h after activation with LPS and washed one time in PBS (pH 7.4). Nuclear extract was isolated using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). For detection of NF-κB binding, nuclear extract from cells (∼5 μg of protein) was incubated with 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide sequence in a 10-μl reaction volume containing 5× gel shift binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 m m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC)) for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and visualized directly by autoradiography after drying the gel. The NF-κB consensus sequence (Promega) was labeled with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) per 25 ng of oligonucleotide, 1× kinase buffer, and 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, catalog no. PB10168, 10 mCi/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The bound NF-κB bands were quantified by scanning densitometry of a bio-image analysis system. The results for each treatment were expressed as relative intensity compared with the control (saline-treated) intensity.Animal Experiments—All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Research Institute. Male Balb/C mice, ∼8 weeks old, were subjected to endotoxemia or cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).Endotoxemia—Endotoxemia was induced by injection of a sublethal dose of LPS (5 mg/kg; intraperitoneally). Mice were treated with various concentrations of ISO-1 (3.5–35 mg/kg; intraperitoneally) or vehicle (aqueous 5% dimethyl sulfoxide) 30 min before and 6 h after LPS infusion and then twice daily for 3 days. Animals were monitored for survival for 2 weeks.Cecal Ligation and Puncture-induced Polymicrobial Sepsis—Mice were anesthetized (ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylazine 8 mg/kg administered intramuscularly), and abdominal access was gained via a midline incision. The cecum was isolated and ligated with a 6-0 silk ligature below the ileocecal valve and the cecum punctured once with a 22-gauge needle; stool (∼1 mm) was extruded from the hole and the cecum placed back into the abdominal cavity. The abdomen was closed with two layers of 6-0 Ethilon sutures. Antibiotics were administered immediately after CLP (0.5 mg/kg Premaxin, subcutaneously, in a total volume of 0.5 ml/mouse) and a single dose of resuscitative fluid (normal saline solution administered subcutaneously (20 ml/kg body weight) immediately after CLP surgery (18Wang H.

Control (aqueous 5% dimethyl sulfoxide as a vehicle) or ISO-1 (35 mg/kg; intraperitoneally) treatment was started 24 h after the induction of sepsis and repeated twice daily for 3 days. In one series of experiments, anti-MIF antibody (2.8 mg/kg; intraperitoneally) treatments were started 24 h after CLP-induced sepsis and then given once daily for 3 days. Animal survival was monitored for 2 weeks.Statistical Analysis—Student's t test, p < 0.05, was accepted as statistically significant and graphs show mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed with Fisher's Exact Test using Prisim software.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCurrent data suggests that neutralization of the pro-inflammatory activity of MIF would be highly beneficial in the treatment of many diseases (5Calandra T. Roger T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 6Riedemann N.C. Guo R.F. Ward P.A. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). This assertion is supported by the substantial therapeutic effects of MIF-specific antibodies in several models of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Although anti-MIF antibody attenuates the inflammatory cascade in sepsis improving the survival rate, it is difficult to use anti-MIF antibodies as tools to delineate the mechanisms underlying MIF proinflammatory activity. Here we identify a method of inhibiting MIF pro-inflammatory activities by targeting MIF tautomerase activity, an evolutionary ancient activity of MIF. We reasoned that a more desirable approach than antibodies would be to develop non-toxic molecules that can specifically block the pro-inflammatory activities of MIF (15Lubetsky J.B. Dios A. Han J. Aljabari B. Ruzsicska B. Mitchell R. Lolis E. Al-Abed Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24976-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We have designed small molecule inhibitors of MIF by targeting a unique, catalytically active site within the cytokine molecule. It is known that disruption of the active site by insertion of an alanine between Pro-1 and Met-2 abolishes the MIF tautomerase activity, and the resultant mutant is defective in the in vitro glucocorticoid counter-regulatory activity of MIF. Several other studies have supported the link between MIF bioactivity and this active site (19Zang X. Taylor P. Wang J.M. Meyer D.J. Scott A.L. Walkinshaw M.D. Maizels R.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 444-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Our first class of MIF inhibitors was a p-hydroxyphenylimine derivative of amino acids, rationally designed based on the scaffold of dopachrome and p-hydroxyphenyl pyurvate (13Rosengren E. Aman P. Thelin S. Hansson C. Ahlfors S. Bjork P. Jacobsson L. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 22Rosengren E. Thelin S. Aman P. Hansson C. Jacobsson L. Rorsman H. Melanoma Res. 1997; 7: 517-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). l-Trp Schiff base emerged as the most potent inhibitor of MIF tautomerase activity (17Dios A. Mitchell R.A. Aljabari B. Lubetsky J. O'Connor K. Liao H. Senter P.D. Manogue K.R. Lolis E. Metz C. Bucala R. Callaway D.J. Al-Abed Y. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, l-Trp Schiff base compounds lack long term stability. We also have shown that a P450-dependent metabolite of acetaminophen, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), covalently binds to MIF at its enzymatic site (23Senter P.D. Al-Abed Y. Metz C.N. Benigni F. Mitchell R.A. Chesney J. Han J. Gartner C.G. Nelson S.D. Todaro G.J. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The NAPQI adduct inactivates MIF cytokine activity in a number of in vitro bioassays, including interference with the anti-inflammatory effect of dexamethasone, confirming the role of the active site in mediating MIF bioactivity. However, NAPQI is not useful as an anti-inflammatory agent, because it has an unacceptable toxicity profile. Thus, we have designed ISO-1 as an inhibitor of MIF tautomerase and glucocorticoid regulating activity (15Lubetsky J.B. Dios A. Han J. Aljabari B. Ruzsicska B. Mitchell R. Lolis E. Al-Abed Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24976-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MIF complexed to ISO-1 reveals that ISO-1 binds within the active site in a similar manner to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (14Lubetsky J.B. Swope M. Dealwis C. Blake P. Lolis E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7346-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar).Our previous studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between the specific ISO-1 inhibition of MIF tautomerase activity and suppression of MIF pro-inflammatory activities (15Lubetsky J.B. Dios A. Han J. Aljabari B. Ruzsicska B. Mitchell R. Lolis E. Al-Abed Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24976-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), but it was not known if inhibiting endogenous MIF tautomerase activity with ISO-1 would suppress inflammation in vivo. As a first step we examined the uptake of ISO-1 by RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages using fluorescently labeled ISO-1 conjugated to rhodamine (FLISO-1) (supplemental Fig. 2). After exposing macrophages to FL-ISO-1 for 30 min, the presence of the fluorescent ISO-1 derivative was observed in the cytoplasm and nuclei of the cells. The accumulation of fluorescence increased from 2 to 30 min (Fig. 1a).To determine whether ISO-1 could inhibit intracellular MIF tautomerase activity, macrophages were treated with various concentrations of ISO-1 (10–100 μm) for 30 min. The medium was then replaced with ISO-1-free medium. The cells were then lysed and the tautomerase activity determined (17Dios A. Mitchell R.A. Aljabari B. Lubetsky J. O'Connor K. Liao H. Senter P.D. Manogue K.R. Lolis E. Metz C. Bucala R. Callaway D.J. Al-Abed Y. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Senter P.D. Al-Abed Y. Metz C.N. Benigni F.

ISO-1 applied to the cell cultures inhibited intracellular tautomerase activity in a dose dependent manner, indicating that the exogenous ISO-1 led to suppression of intracellular MIF tautomerase activity.Intracellular MIF occupies a critical role in mediating the cellular responses to pathways activated by LPS (24Roger T. David J. Glauser M.P. Calandra T. Nature. 2001; 414: 920-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Endogenous MIF is required for the basal expression of TLR4, the endotoxin receptor, and MIF-deficient cells are hyporesponsive to endotoxin (2Bozza M. Satoskar A.R. Lin G. Lu B. Humbles A.A. Gerard C. David J.R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 24Roger T. David J. Glauser M.P. Calandra T. Nature. 2001; 414: 920-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we reasoned that ISO-1 inhibition of MIF would suppress endotoxin responses in macrophages. ISO-1 dosedependently inhibited endotoxin induced TNF release (Fig. 2a) and nuclear translocation of NF-κB up to 70% at 100 μm (Fig. 2b). Thus ISO-1 recapitulates the phenotype of the MIF deficient macrophages and is associated with decreased NF-κB activation and TNF production in response to LPS.FIGURE 2a, ISO-1 inhibits TNF secretion from LPS-treated macrophages. RAW 267. 4 macrophages (105) were treated with various concentrations of ISO-1 (1–100 μm)30min prior to LPS (100 ng/ml) addition. After 16 h of incubation, cells culture supernatants were collected for determination of TNF concentration by an ELISA. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. (n = 3; *, p < 0.05 and **, p < 0.001); b, ISO-1 inhibits NF-kB activation from LPS-treated macrophages. Macrophages were treated with various concentrations of ISO-1 (1–100 μm) 30 min prior to LPS addition. The nuclear extract was isolated using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents. For detection of NF-κB binding, nuclear extract from cells (∼5 μg of protein) was incubated with 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide sequence, and the samples were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel and visualized directly by autoradiography after drying the gel. The results for each treatment were expressed as relative intensity compared with the control (saline-treated) intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the anti-inflammatory effects of ISO-1 in vivo, we next administered ISO-1 to wild type and MIF knock-out mice. Consistent with the study by Mitchell et al. (25Mitchell R.A. Liao H. Chesney J. Fingerle-Rowson G. Baugh J. David J. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), peritoneal macrophages from LPS-treated MIF knock-out mice produced 60% less TNF than those isolated from wild type mice under similar conditions (Fig. 3a). ISO-1 inhibited TNF release by 67% in peritoneal macrophages from wild type mice (Fig. 3a). Importantly, ISO-1 administered to endotoxemic MIF-knock-out mice did not attenuate the macrophage TNF release. This indicates that the effect of ISO-1 in suppressing macrophage responses to LPS requires endogenous MIF.FIGURE 3ISO-1 is protective agent in mouse model of endotoxemia.a, ISO-1 inhibition of TNFα production is specific to MIF. As described previously (25Mitchell R.A. Liao H. Chesney J. Fingerle-Rowson G. Baugh J. David J. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), C57Bl/6 MIF+/+ and MIF–/– mice (each n = 7) were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (10 mg/kg) and either ISO-1 (1 mg/mouse) or vehicle. Peritoneal macrophages were cultured ex vivo for an additional 24 h, at which time supernatants were collected for determination of TNF concentration by ELISA; b, male Balb/C mice were injected (intraperitoneally) with LPS (10 mg/kg) and followed by different doses of ISO-1 (3.5–35 mg/kg) or vehicle twice a day for 3 days. Mice were observed for 2 weeks. Data points are from three independent experiments (n = 33; **, p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We tested whether ISO-1 can improve the survival rate from lethal endotoxemia. ISO-1 treatment for 3 days dose-dependently improved survival of endotoxemic mice (p < 0.001 at 35 mg/kg), as compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 3b). This level of survival improvement by ISO-1 is comparable with the effect of anti-MIF antibodies in the same model (3Bernhagen J. Calandra T. Mitchell R.A. Martin S.B. Tracey K.J. Voelter W. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Bucala R. Nature. 1993; 365: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). We also tested the toxicity of ISO-1 in mice and found no evidence of lethality up to 250 mg/kg. This concentration is almost 7-fold higher than the maximum dose used in our in vivo studies.The importance of MIF as a molecular therapeutic target in sepsis has been confirmed by the observation that treatment with anti-MIF antibodies significantly Improves survival in septic mice (1Calandra T. Echtenacher B. Roy D.L. Pugin J. Metz C.N. Hultner L. Heumann D. Mannel D. Bucala R. Glauser M.P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). We examined the time course of MIF release in mice with CLP-induced peritonitis, a widely used model of sepsis. We found that serum MIF levels increased to 70% of maximum levels within 24 h post-CLP and peaked at 36 h (data not shown). This identified MIF as a late mediator in sepsis, with potential to be inhibited in a clinically relevant time frame. Based on these results we reasoned that a delayed treatment with ISO-1, consistent with the kinetics of MIF release, could be successfully applied to improve survival. ISO-1 treatment (35 mg/kg) initiated 24 h after CLP surgery and continued for 3 days resulted in survival of 77% (p < 0.001) compared with 38% in the control (vehicle-treated) group (Fig. 4a). Anti-MIF antibodies (3.5 mg/kg) given in a similar time frame improved survival comparable with ISO-1 (Fig. 4b). This is the first evidence that a specific inhibitor of MIF that targets the tautomerase site is protective against lethal sepsis in an established, widely used animal model.FIGURE 4ISO-1 treatment is protective when initiated 24 h after induction of polymicrobial sepsis. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with ISO-1 (35 mg/kg) (n = 34, **, p < 0. 001) (a) or 100 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody against MIF (XIV.15.5; Anti-MIF) or IgG (control antibody) or vehicle 24 h after CLP (n = 15) (b). An additional two injections were given on days 2 and 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These data indicate that MIF activity can be therapeutically regulated with a molecule that specifically targets the tautomerase active site, a non-essential enzymatic function. It is not likely that the tautomerase activity is directly involved in the proinflammatory action of MIF, because no physiological substrates of the D-series of molecules have been identified in vertebrates. Rather, it is much more plausible that ISO-1 interacts specifically with MIF at the tautomerase site, resulting in altered binding"

Although the Lrat-/- mice possess only trace amounts of retinyl esters in liver, lung, and kidney, they possess elevated (by 2-3-fold) concentrations of retinyl esters in adipose tissue compared with wild type mice. These adipose retinyl ester depots are mobilized in times of dietary retinoid insufficiency. We further observed an up-regulation (3-4-fold) in the level of cytosolic retinol-binding protein type III (CRBPIII) in adipose tissue of Lrat-/- mice. Examination by electron microscopy reveals a striking total absence of large lipid-containing droplets that normally store hepatic retinoid within the hepatic stellate cells of Lrat-/- mice. Despite the absence of significant retinyl ester stores and stellate cell lipid droplets, the livers of Lrat-/- mice upon histologic analysis appear normal and show no histological signs of liver fibrosis. Lrat-/- mice absorb dietary retinol primarily as free retinol in chylomicrons; however, retinyl esters are also present within the chylomicron fraction obtained from Lrat-/- mice.

Most tissues also possess some capacity to esterify and thus store retinol prior to its use for the synthesis of retinal or retinoic acid (9Blaner W.S. Olson J.A. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S.

LRAT is broadly expressed in tissues and at relatively high levels in the intestine, liver, and eye where it has been proposed to catalyze the transesterification of retinol with an acyl group present in the A1 position of membrane lecithin (17Herr F.M.

Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recently, the gene encoding LRAT was knocked out in mice (20Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10422-10432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It was clear from the initial studies of Lrat-deficient (Lrat-/-) mice that LRAT is the preponderant and possibly sole enzyme responsible for retinyl ester formation in the eye and liver (20Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10422-10432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Lrat-/- mice when maintained on a control diet develop normally and show no obvious phenotypic differences when compared with wild type mice. However, at an early age these mutant mice do show a phenotype of severely attenuated rod and cone visual functions. Moreover, only trace levels of all-trans-retinyl esters were detected in the liver, eye, and blood of Lrat-/- mice. The literature suggests the existence of an additional enzymatic activity within cells and tissues that is able to esterify retinol in an acyl-CoA-dependent manner. This enzymatic activity has been termed acyl-CoA:retinol acyl-transferase (ARAT) (24Ross A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2453-2459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this ARAT activity has not been established.We are interested in studying the importance of retinyl esters and LRAT in the uptake of dietary retinoid and its storage in the liver and other tissues and in understanding how retinyl ester accumulation influences normal retinoid-dependent functions in the body. For instance, the loss of hepatic stellate cell retinyl ester stores occurs with stellate cell activation and the development of hepatic fibrosis (25Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 26Geerts A. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 311-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Similarly, dietary retinoid is normally absorbed almost exclusively as retinyl ester, but humans afflicted with abetalipoproteinemia must absorb retinoids through another route because they are unable to package retinyl esters in chylomicrons (27Berriot-Varoqueaux N. Aggerbeck L.P. Samson-Bouma M.-E. Wetterau J.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 663-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The mechanism of retinoid uptake in abetalipoproteinemia patients has yet to be defined. Below we report further characterizations of the Lrat-/- mice that are relevant for understanding the role of LRAT and retinyl esters in maintaining normal retinoid-dependent function and preventing disease.MATERIALS AND METHODSDiet and Animal Husbandry—Animals were maintained on a standard rodent chow diet. For all of our studies, male and female wild type and Lrat-/- mice at 3-4 months of age were employed. The genotypes of these mice were determined by a PCR protocol and tail clip DNA according to a protocol described previously (20Batten M.L. Imanishi Y. Maeda T. Tu D.C. Moise A.R. Bronson D. Possin D. Van Gelder R.N. Baehr W. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10422-10432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of a retinoid-deficient diet on wild type and Lrat-/- mice, we employed a purified, nutritionally complete control retinoid-deficient diet (Purified Test Diet 5755; W. F. Fisher and Son, Inc.) containing <0.22 IU of retinol/g but otherwise nutritionally complete diet. Prior to administration of this diet to Lrat-/- and wild type mice at 3 months of age, these mice were maintained from weaning on a standard nutritionally complete chow diet (W. F. Fisher and Sons, Inc.). For all of our studies, both diet and water were available to the animals on an ad libitum basis. Mice were maintained on a 12-h dark-light cycle, with the period of darkness between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. All mice used in our studies were sacrificed in the morning between 9:30 and 11:30 a.m. The animal experimentation described in this study was conducted in accordance with the National Research Council (50National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 7th Ed. National Academy Press, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar) and was approved by the Institutional Committee on Animal Care, Columbia University.HPLC Analysis of Retinoids—Tissue and serum retinol and retinyl ester levels were determined by reverse phase HPLC procedures that have been described previously (28Blaner W.S. Obunike J.C. Kurlandsky S.B. Al-Haideri M. Piantedosi R. Deckelbaum R.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16559-16565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, serum and tissues (liver, lung, kidney, testis, perigonadal (epididymal or ovarian) adipose tissue, and heart) were flash-frozen in liquid N2 after their dissection from the experimental mice. For this analysis, tissues were first homogenized in 10 volumes of PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm sodium chloride) using a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments) set at half-maximal speed for 10 s. Homogenates (or 200-μl aliquots of the homogenates in the case of liver) were then treated with an equal volume of absolute ethanol containing known amounts of retinyl acetate as an internal standard, and the retinoids present in the homogenates were extracted into hexane. The extracted retinoids were separated on a 4.6 × 250-mm Ultrasphere C18 column (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) preceded by a C18 guard column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), using 70% acetonitrile, 15% methanol, 15% methylene chloride as the running solvent flowing at 1.8 ml/min. Retinol and retinyl esters (retinyl palmitate, oleate, linoleate, and stearate) were detected at 325 nm and identified by comparing the retention times and spectral data of experimental compounds with those of authentic standards. Concentrations of retinol and retinyl esters in the tissues were quantitated by comparing integrated peak areas for those of each retinoid against those of known amounts of purified standards. Loss during extraction was accounted for by adjusting for the recovery of the internal standard added immediately after homogenization of the tissues.Tissue retinoic acid determinations were carried out using procedures we have described earlier (29Kurlandsky S.B. Gamble M.V. Ramakrishnan R. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17850-17857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). All extraction and analytical procedures were carried out under dim yellow light in brown glass tubes to protect the retinoids from exposure to light. Plasma samples were diluted with equal volumes of PBS prior to extraction. Tissues were homogenized in PBS (2 ml of PBS/g of tissue) using three 15-s pulses of a Brinkmann Polytron PT 300 homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments), at setting 5 on the homogenizer. An internal standard consisting of a known amount of all-trans-7-(1,1,3,3,-tetramethyl-5-indanyl)-3-methyl-octa-2,4,6-trienoic acid (provided by Hoffmann-LaRoche) was added in 0.1 ml of ethanol to each plasma or tissue sample in order to monitor the recovery of retinoic acid during the extraction and HPLC procedures. This extraction procedure is gentle and does not cause retinoyl-β-glucuronide hydrolysis. Plasma and tissue homogenates were extracted twice with chloroform/methanol (2:1), and the chloroform extracts were combined and concentrated, under a gentle stream of N2, to a final volume of less than 1 ml. The retinoid-containing chloroform extract was then applied to 100 or 500 mg of aminopropyl solid phase extraction columns (Baxter Laboratories Inc., Chicago) that had been equilibrated previously with hexane. Under these chromatographic conditions, most lipids are retained by the column. The neutral lipids were eluted first from the column with 5 ml of chloroform/isopropyl alcohol (2:1). After the neutral lipids were eluted, the retinoic acid was eluted from the aminopropyl column with 5 ml of 2% acetic acid in diethyl ether containing 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene as an antioxidant. The acetic acid/diethyl ether eluates were collected, evaporated to dryness under a gentle stream of N2, and redissolved in HPLC mobile phase (hexane/acetonitrile/acetic acid, 99.5:0.4:0.1) for injection onto the HPLC. All-trans-retinoic acid levels were determined by normal phase HPLC employing two silica columns linked in tandem. The silica columns consisted of a 3.9 × 150-mm 5-μm Resolve (Waters) followed by a 4.6 × 150-mm 3-μm Supelcosil LC-Si (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA). The first column was preceded by a Waters Silica Guard-PAK guard column. For chromatography, we employed an isocratic system using the mobile phase described above flowing at 1.8 ml/min. The mobile phase was made fresh daily and filtered and degassed immediately prior to use. Retinoic acid mass was detected at 350 nm using a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. All-trans-retinoic acid levels were quantitated from the integrated area under its peak using a standard curve, constructed with authentic standards of all-trans-retinoic acid of known mass. For standards, authentic all-trans- and 9-cis-retinoic acid were obtained as a gift (Hoffmann-La Roche), and authentic 13-cis-retinoic acid was obtained from Sigma. Low limits of detection for all-trans-, 13-cis-, and 9-cis-retinoic acid in our HPLC assay were estimated to be less than 1.5 pmol/g tissue.Histology and Electron Microscopy—Tissues (liver and adipose tissue) from 3-month-old wild type and Lrat-/- mice were fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin. The samples were processed and paraffin-embedded in a core facility at the Department of Pathology, Columbia University Medical Center. Sections were applied to glass slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome. For immunohistochemical analysis, 5-μm sections were applied to Fisherbrand Superfrost/Plus Slides. Monoclonal antibodies against α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (dilution 1:400; Dako, Carpinteria, CA), desmin (dilution 1:100; Dako), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (dilution 1:100; Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) were employed. Prior to staining, heat-induced antigen retrieval was performed in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.0. Staining was performed on a Dako autostainer using Dako Envision Plus with diaminobenzidine as chromagen. Hematoxylin was used as a counterstain.Western Blot Analysis of CRBPI and CRBPIII—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against the C terminus of both mouse CRBPI and mouse CRBPIII as described previously (30Piantedosi R. Ghyselinck N. Blaner W.S. Vogel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24286-24292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The resulting anti-CRBPI and anti-CRBPIII were immunoaffinity-purified, respectively, on CRBPI-Sepharose and CRBPIII-Sepharose to yield anti-CRBPI and anti-CRBPIII preparations that did not cross-react (30Piantedosi R. Ghyselinck N. Blaner W.S. Vogel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24286-24292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cytosolic extracts of liver and perigonadal adipose tissue samples were prepared from age- and sex-matched wild type and Lrat-/- mice for Western blot analysis according to procedures we have described previously (30Piantedosi R. Ghyselinck N. Blaner W.S. Vogel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24286-24292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody directed against β-actin was used as a control to confirm protein load (Sigma). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by chemiluminescence (Pierce).Radioimmunoassay (RIA) for RBP—Analyses of tissue and blood RBP levels were carried out by RIA. For these analyses, we employed antiserum against rat RBP and the standard procedures we reported earlier (31Blaner W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).In Vitro DGAT1 Assay—HEK293 cells were transfected with the mammalian expression vector pCR3.1 harboring a cDNA encoding human DGAT1 (a gift from Drs. Henry Ginsberg and Steven Sturley of Columbia University) using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol (32Liang J.J. Oelkers P. Guo C. Chu P.C. Dixon J.L. Ginsberg H.N. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44938-44944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions containing DGAT1 were prepared from the postmitochondrial fraction of HEK293 cells. Briefly, cells in monolayer were washed twice with cold PBS and then scraped into ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) containing 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, bestatin, pepstatin A, and E-64. Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min before homogenization employing 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. A 0.25 volume of 30% sucrose was added to the sample immediately following homogenization. The homogenization mixture was then centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged again at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The membrane pellet was homogenized and resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, and the protease inhibitor mixture. Protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to the supplier's instructions.DGAT1 activity was measured by modifying a method described previously (33Yen C.-L.E. Monetti M. Burri B.J. Farese R.V. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1502-1511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, 15 μg of membrane protein was added to a 200-μl reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, 25 μm palmitoyl-CoA, and 16 μm all-trans-retinol added in a small volume of ethanol. The reaction mixture was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min. To assess the effects of CRBPI on CoA-dependent retinol esterification, incubations were carried out similarly except that retinol was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 16 μm purified holo-His-tagged mouse CRBPI. Microsomal protein was then added to the reaction mixture and allowed to incubate further for 10 min at 37 °C. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of 200 μl of ice-cold ethanol. Samples were extracted into hexane, and the retinyl palmitate content was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC as described above for tissue retinoid analysis.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Mouse CRBPI and CRBPIII—To obtain purified CRBPI and CRBPIII protein, cDNAs encoding each of the proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli using the PetVector expression system (Novagen, Madison, WI). CRBPI and CRBPIII expression vector induction, expression, and purification of recombinant proteins containing the 3′ His tags were performed as described earlier (30Piantedosi R. Ghyselinck N. Blaner W.S. Vogel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24286-24292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli expressing a specific recombinant protein was extracted into B-FER Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce), and this extract was sonicated on ice until it was no longer viscous. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g and applied to a column (1 cm diameter, 7.5 ml volume) packed with 1 ml of His-Bind resin (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The column was washed with 3 volumes of sterile deionized water and 5 volumes of charge buffer (50 mm NiSO4), followed by 3 volumes of binding buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.9). The column was loaded with the supernatant, washed with 10 volumes of binding buffer, and washed again with 6 volumes of wash buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm imidazole, pH 7.9). The recombinant His-tagged CRBPs were eluted from the resin with 6 volumes of elution buffer (1 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). The purity of each protein was determined by 12% SDS-PAGE prior to its use in our experiments.Isolation of Chylomicrons—Three-month-old female and male wild type and Lrat-/- mice received an intraperitoneal injection of the lipase inhibitor, P-407 (1 g/kg body weight) ∼12 h before the experiment began (34Wasan K.M. Subramanian R. Kwong M. Goldberg I.J. Wright T. Johnston T.P. J. Pharm. Pharm. Sci. 2003; 6: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar, 35Johnston T.P. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2004; 43: 595-6"

https://openalex.org/W2085441242,"Mitochondria are important participants in apoptosis, releasing cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and undergoing extensive fragmentation. However, mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that cytochrome c release during apoptosis precedes mitochondrial fragmentation. Unexpectedly, OPA1, a dynamin-like GTPase of the mitochondrial intermembrane space important for maintaining cristae structure, is co-released with cytochrome c. To mimic the loss of OPA1 occurring after its release, we knocked down OPA1 expression using RNA interference. This triggered structural changes in the mitochondrial cristae and caused increased fragmentation by blocking mitochondrial fusion. Because cytochrome c is mostly sequestered within cristae folds but released rapidly and completely during apoptosis, we examined the effect of OPA1 loss on cytochrome c release, demonstrating that it is accelerated. Thus, our results suggest that an initial mitochondrial leak of OPA1 leads to cristae structural alterations and exposure of previously sequestered protein pools, permitting continued release in a feed-forward manner to completion. Moreover, our findings indicate that the resulting OPA1 depletion causes a block in mitochondrial fusion, providing a compelling mechanism for the prominent increase in mitochondrial fragmentation seen during apoptosis.

Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are important participants in PCD resulting from a variety of death stimuli via the release after Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic factors into the cytoplasm, where they trigger activation of caspases and subsequently promote cell death (2Danial N.N.

During PCD mitochondria also undergo extensive fragmentation, which recent studies have indicated may promote apoptotic cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as well (4Jagasia R. Grote P.

The morphology of mitochondria within a cell is normally controlled by a precise balance of fusion and fission (5Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms whereby mitochondria fragment extensively during apoptosis remain controversial. One possibility is that the release of proteins after MOMP stimulates mitochondrial division by activating fission and/or inhibiting fusion. An alternative hypothesis is that mitochondrial division is itself necessary, directly or indirectly, for the release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c (6Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2005; 433: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Another area of contention centers on the release of cytochrome c itself during PCD. Although most cytochrome c (>80%) is normally sequestered within mitochondrial cristae folds, release is known to be rapid and complete during apoptosis (7Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanism remains unclear, it has been suggested to occur through changes such as mitochondrial fragmentation or inner membrane cristae reorganization (8Bossy-Wetzel E.

Here, we sought to clarify the mechanisms and temporal relationships of mitochondrial fragmentation and ultrastructural cristae changes in the context of MOMP and the resulting cytochrome c release during apoptosis. Cell Culture and Reagents—HeLa cells and HeLa cells stably overexpressing Bcl-2 were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfection of HeLa cells with Mito-DsRed2 (BD Biosciences Clontech) was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) to identify mitochondria. Transfection with photoactivable Mito-PAGFP was performed as described previously (10Karbowski M. Arnoult D. Chen H. Chan D.C. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). zVAD-fmk and MitoTracker Red CMXRos were purchased from Calbiochem and Molecular Probes, respectively. Actinomycin D and staurosporine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Subcellular Fractionation and Immunoblotting—HeLa cells were harvested in isotonic mitochondrial buffer (MB: 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)) supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and homogenized for 30-40 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. Samples were transferred to Eppendorf centrifuge tubes and centrifuged (500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was then centrifuged (10,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) to obtain the heavy membrane fraction enriched for mitochondria; the resulting supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. Cytosolic and heavy membranes fractions (30 and 10 μg of protein, respectively) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10-20% Tricine gels; Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). After blocking nonspecific sites for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk and 0.2% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), the membrane was incubated with anti-cytochrome c mouse monoclonal (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, clone 7H8.2C12) (1:2000 dilution) and anti-OPA1 rabbit polyclonal (3 μg/ml) antibodies as described previously (11Zhu P.-P. Patterson A. Lavoie B. Stadler J. Shoeb M. Patel R. Blackstone C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49063-49071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To confirm equal protein loading and transfer, membranes were subsequently reprobed with anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, clone AC-40) (1:5000) and anti-Cox IV monoclonal antibodies (Molecular Probes, clone 10G8) (1:3000) as indicated. After treatment with horse-radish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:2000; Amersham Biosciences), immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown in LabTek chambers were fixed for 5 min at -20 °C in methanol followed by permeabilization with 0.15% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. The cells were then incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) followed by incubation overnight with either a rabbit polyclonal anti-OPA1 (11Zhu P.-P. Patterson A. Lavoie B. Stadler J. Shoeb M. Patel R. Blackstone C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49063-49071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (1.5 μg/ml) or a mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, clone 6H2.B4) (1:800) antibody. Cells were washed 3 times for 10 min each in blocking buffer then incubated for 2 h with Alexa Fluor secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope through a 63× oil fluorescence objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). Isolation of Mitochondria and in Vitro Assays for the Release of Mitochondrial Factors—Mitochondria were isolated intact from HeLa cells by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Briefly, cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA, centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min, washed, and resuspended in isotonic MB supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cells were broken by five passages through a 25-gauge needle fitted onto a 5-ml syringe, and the suspension was then centrifuged at 2000 × g at 4 °C. This procedure was repeated until nearly all of the cells were broken. Supernatants from each step were pooled before centrifugation (13,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The resulting pellet containing mitochondria was resuspended in 1 ml of MB and layered on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient consisting of 19 ml of 1.2 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) over 16 ml of 1.6 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Samples were centrifuged (27,000 rpm, 2 h, 4 °C) in a Beckman SW28 rotor. Mitochondria were recovered at the 1.6 m/1.2 m sucrose buffer interface, washed, and resuspended in MB. Isolated mitochondria (30 μg) were incubated in the presence or absence of various concentrations of caspase-8-cleaved recombinant human Bid (tBid; R&D Systems) in 200 μl of KCl buffer (125 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaHPO4, 5 mm succinate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 15 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), and 5 μm rotenone) for 20 min at 30 °C, and the mitochondria were recovered by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). In other experiments, 10 nm tBid was used for various time points, and the mitochondria were recovered by centrifugation as above. Aliquots of mitochondrial pellets (5 μg protein) and the corresponding volume of the supernatant fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10-20% Tricine gels (Novex) and their respective contents of cytochrome c and OPA1 were estimated by immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal anti-cytochrome c (BD Sciences Pharmingen) (1:2000; clone 7H8.2C12) or polyclonal rabbit anti-OPA1 (11Zhu P.-P. Patterson A. Lavoie B. Stadler J. Shoeb M. Patel R. Blackstone C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49063-49071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) (3 μg/ml) antibodies. Consistent loading of the mitochondrial pellet was verified using anti-voltage-dependent anion channel antibodies (Calbiochem; clone 31HL) (1:6000). Cytochrome c release was also quantitated using a colorimetric enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Quantikine DCTC0; R&D Systems) as previously described (9Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteinase K, Carbonate, and KCl Treatments of Isolated Mitochondria—Isolated mitochondria prepared as described above were incubated for 20 min on ice with 200 μg/ml proteinase K in 500 μl of MB or 500 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer for mitochondrial swelling. The pellet was recovered by centrifugation (130,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). For carbonate extraction, isolated mitochondria were resuspended in a 0.1 m Na2CO3 buffer (pH 11.0) and incubated on ice for 30 min; the pellet was then recovered by centrifugation (130,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). For salt wash experiments, mitochondria were diluted 10-fold in buffers consisting of either 30 mm NaCl or 500 mm NaCl in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and sonicated at the highest level 10 times for 10 s per cycle. The pellet was recovered by centrifugation (130,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C). Proteins from the resulting supernatants were concentrated by precipitation with 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Cytochrome c, OPA1, and VDAC levels were then assessed in both fractions by immunoblotting. RNA Interference—Silencing of OPA1 and Mfn1 expression in HeLa cells was achieved using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Synthetic oligonucleotides representing sequences from positions 1810 to 1831 of OPA1 (5′-GUUAUCAGUCUGAGCCAGGTT-3′; GenBank™ accession number AB011139) and 186 to 207 of Mfn1 (5′-GGAUCACAUUUUGUUGAAGTT-3′; GenBank™ accession number AF329637) were produced by Ambion. A Silencer Negative Control siRNA (Ambion) was used for control experiments. HeLa cells grown to 30-40% confluency were transfected 3 times sequentially with annealed siRNA duplexes using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Levels of OPA1 and Mfn1 were assessed by immunoblotting. For detection of Mfn1, a polyclonal rabbit antiserum (12Eura Y. Ishihara N. Yokota S. Mihara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. K. Mihara, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan) was used (1:500 dilution). Equal protein loading was assessed using an anti-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, clone AC-40) (1:5000). Transmission Electron Microscopy—HeLa cells were fixed with a solution of 2.5% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde buffered with 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) for 24 h at 4 °C, dehydrated with ethanol at 4 °C, and immersed in a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide and Epon and finally embedded in Epon by polymerization at 60 °C for 48 h. Ultrastructural analyses were performed on a JEOL1010 electron microscope. Time-lapse Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy and Kinetics of Cytochrome c-GFP Release—HeLa cells stably expressing cytochrome c-GFP (13Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) were cultured in LabTek chambers under standard conditions and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 IU penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Six hours after apoptosis induction, cytochrome c-GFP release was analyzed every 30 s through a 63× oil fluorescence objective using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Ultra View RS Nipkow-disk confocal microscope equipped with a 488-nm argon laser and a temperature controller to maintain the temperature at 37 °C. GFP excitation was kept as low as possible to avoid photo-destruction of the cell. Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence images was performed using MetaMorph software. The release kinetics of cytochrome c-GFP are depicted as the S.D. of the average pixel intensity across individual cells, as previously described (13Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Compartmentalized cytochrome c-GFP within mitochondria contributes to a high S.D., and more homogeneously distributed cytochrome c-GFP in the cytoplasm gives rise to a low S.D. For direct comparisons and statistical analyses, initial S.D. values were normalized, and single cell standard deviation traces were scaled from 100 (base line before the release) to 0 (base line after completion of the release). Data were exported to Microsoft Excel and converted into graphical displays. Statistical Analyses—Data were compared using Student's t test. Differences were considered to be significant if p < 0.05. Mitochondrial Fragmentation Occurs Downstream of Bax/Bak-mediated Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization—It is generally accepted that PCD occurs downstream of Bax/Bak-mediated MOMP (2Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4040) Google Scholar, 14Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar). Because previous reports have also shown that Bax and Bak promote mitochondrial fragmentation (15Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether this fragmentation also occurs after MOMP. We investigated HeLa cells stably expressing cytochrome c-GFP (13Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) to determine the temporal relationship between MOMP (assessed by cytochrome c-GFP release) and mitochondrial fragmentation. Cells stably expressing cytochrome c-GFP were transiently transfected with Mito-DsRed2 to label mitochondria and then treated with actinomycin D to induce Bax/Bak-mediated MOMP (14Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar) in the presence of the broad caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk to prevent apoptosis. Mitochondrial morphology and cytochrome c-GFP release were then assessed in living cells every 5 min. In agreement with a previous report (16Gao W. Pu Y. Luo K.Q. Chang D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that cytochrome c-GFP was released before mitochondrial fragmentation; minutes later mitochondria started to fragment in a caspase-independent manner (Fig. 1A). Analysis of multiple different cells revealed that mitochondrial fragmentation typically occurred ∼10 min after cytochrome c-GFP was completely released (Fig. 1B), similar to the findings of Gao et al. (16Gao W. Pu Y. Luo K.Q. Chang D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially the same results were obtained substituting staurosporine, another pro-apoptotic drug, for actinomycin D (data not shown). Experiments performed in the absence of zVAD-fmk similarly demonstrated mitochondrial fragmentation on average ∼10 min after the complete release of cytochrome c-GFP (data not shown). Because the timing of mitochondrial fragmentation relative to release of cytochrome c after MOMP is an important issue for clarifying mechanisms of mitochondrial fragmentation during PCD, our results are particularly noteworthy in light of a recent study reporting that expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax in the protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, which has only a single mitochondrion, causes the release of cytochrome c followed by mitochondrial fragmentation, with these events temporally well separated (17Esseiva A.C. Chanez A.L. Bochud-Allemann N. Martinou J.-C. Hemphill A. Schneider A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These findings conceptually support the data we present in Fig. 1, as well as those of Gao et al. (16Gao W. Pu Y. Luo K.Q. Chang D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in mammalian cells, Bax (and Bak) are known to form clusters at scission sites of mitochondria (18Karbowski M. Lee Y.-J. Gaume B. Jeong S.-Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), but by that time cytochrome c has already been released into the cytoplasm, 3D. Arnoult, unpublished observations. consistent with our assertion that cytochrome c release precedes mitochondrial fragmentation. OPA1 Is a Membrane-associated Protein Released After Bax/Bak-mediated MOMP—Recently, Youle and co-workers (10Karbowski M. Arnoult D. Chen H. Chan D.C. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) reported that a block of mitochondrial fusion occurs close in time to Bax/Bak-mediated MOMP, implicating the inhibition of the mitochondrial fusion machinery in mitochondrial fragmentation during apoptosis. In mammalian cells mitochondrial fusion requires the activity of three dynamin-related, large GTPases: Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1 (5Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 8Bossy-Wetzel E. Barsoum M.J. Godzik A. Schwarzenbacher R. Lipton S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Although Bax colocalizes with Mfn2 in the same foci during PCD (18Karbowski M. Lee Y.-J. Gaume B. Jeong S.-Y. Frank S. Nechushtan A. Santel A. Fuller M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), no direct or indirect interactions among any of these proteins have been reported, and the mechanism of this mitochondrial fusion arrest remains unclear. To explain the block of mitochondrial fusion during PCD, we considered that levels of Mfn1, Mfn2, and/or OPA1 in mitochondria might be decreased, and we compared them in mitochondrial fractions from both control and apoptotic cells. Although we did not observe any significant differences in levels of Mfn1 or Mfn2, both integral membrane proteins of the mitochondrial outer membrane (8Bossy-Wetzel E. Barsoum M.J. Godzik A. Schwarzenbacher R. Lipton S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), a marked reduction of OPA1 protein was found in the mitochondria of apoptotic cells (data not shown). Because OPA1 has been identified as a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein tightly associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane but not an integral membrane protein (19Griparic L. van der Wel N.N. Orozco I.J. Peters P.J. van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18792-18798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that its association with the inner mitochondrial membrane might be disrupted as a consequence of Bax/Bak-mediated MOMP, and soluble OPA1 would then be available for release from mitochondria. This was confirmed when we compared cellular fractions from untreated and apoptotic cells. Indeed, the OPA1 protein, like cytochrome c, not only disappeared from the mitochondrial fraction of cells treated with pro-apoptotic drugs, but this disappearance also coincided with its appearance in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 2A). OPA1 release during PCD was similarly revealed by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2B) and as for cytochrome c (7Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar), its release was markedly inhibited in cells stably overexpressing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Fig. 2A). Next, mitochondria isolated from HeLa cells were incubated in vitro with recombinant tBid, a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family that requires either Bax or Bak to trigger MOMP (14Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3354) Google Scholar). Both dose-escalation and kinetic studies with tBid demonstrated that OPA1 and cytochrome c are co-released after MOMP (Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, although cytochrome c release was essentially complete, a slightly greater fraction of OPA1 remained in the mitochondria after MOMP, a result confirmed by both immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting using isolated mitochondria (Fig. 2, B and C). Most likely, the OPA1 remaining in mitochondria after MOMP represents protein still associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane through tight protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions (20Iverson S.L. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, this is an area of some controversy, since recent reports have suggested that whereas mammalian OPA1 is a protein tightly bound to the inner membrane (19Griparic L. van der Wel N.N. Orozco I.J. Peters P.J. van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18792-18798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), its yeast ortholog Mgm1p may be a transmembrane protein anchored in this membrane (8Bossy-Wetzel E. Barsoum M.J. Godzik A. Schwarzenbacher R. Lipton S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Here, we have found, in agreement with Griparic et al. (19Griparic L. van der Wel N.N. Orozco I.J. Peters P.J. van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18792-18798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), that nearly all of the OPA1 protein was released from sonicated mitochondrial membranes after high pH carbonate buffer extraction as well as after low or high salt washes (Fig. 2D), confirming that it is membrane-associated. By contrast VDAC, an integral membrane protein, was not extracted by these same treatments (Fig. 2D). OPA1 Loss Is Associated with Changes in Cristae Structure and Mitochondrial Fragmentation Due to Mitochondrial Fusion Block—In cells undergoing PCD, the complete release of cytochrome c occurs rapidly over ∼5 min (13Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Because we observed that OPA1 is co-released from mitochondria with cytochrome c after MOMP (Fig. 2), release of OPA1 likely occurs within a similar time frame. To mimic the loss of mitochondrial OPA1 that occurs during PCD, we transfected siRNAs to knock down OPA1 protein expression in HeLa cells (Fig. 3A). Reminiscent of previous reports investigating OPA1 (19Griparic L. van der Wel N.N. Orozco I.J. Peters P.J. van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18792-18798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 21Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7743-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) and yeast Mgm1p (22Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), we observed that OPA1 loss results in extensive mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 3, B and C) as well as perturbation of the mitochondrial inner membrane, with prominent disorganization of the cristae (Fig. 3D). Using a cell culture mitochondrial fusion assay employing a photoactivable Mito-PAGFP construct (10Karbowski M. Arnoult D. Chen H. Chan D.C. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), we further demonstrated that loss of OPA1 is associated with a block of mitochondrial fusion; in contrast, fusion was normal both in cells treated with control siRNA and in untreated cells (Fig. 3E). Thus, although OPA1 is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space, it is required for proper mitochondrial fusion, and loss of OPA1 from mitochondria after MOMP likely participates in the fragmentation of mitochondria during PCD through an inhibition of mitochondrial fusion. Loss of OPA1 Facilitates and Accelerates the Release of Cytochrome c From Mitochondria—Recently, it was proposed that a reorganization of mitochondrial cristae is required for the redistribution of cytochrome c normally sequestered from the intermembrane space proper within cristae folds, thus allowing complete release of cytochrome c (9Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Because we and others have demonstrated that OPA1 is required for maintenance of cristae structure and given that OPA1 is co-released with cytochrome c (Fig. 2), the leak of an initial pool of OPA1 along with cytochrome c after MOMP may trigger mitochondrial cristae remodeling, thus permitting the release of additional pools. To test this hypothesis, we studied the release of cytochrome c in vitro using mitochondria isolated from cells in which OPA1 protein expression was knocked down using siRNA, OPA1(-) mitochondria as well as mitochondria derived from control cells. Incubation for 20 min with increasing concentrations of recombinant tBid demonstrated that OPA1(-) mitochondria required about 10-fold lower tBid concentrations than control mitochondria to exhibit complete release (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, in kinetic studies in vitro using 10 nm tBid for various times, we observed that release of cytochrome c was complete within 20 min in control mitochondria, whereas it was complete within only 15 min in OPA1(-) mitochondria (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, release of cytochrome c from OPA1(-) mitochondria was detected as early as 5 min after the addition of 10 nm tBid, whereas at the same time point release was not yet observed in mitochondria from control cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Similar results were obtained in all cases when oligomeric Bax was substituted for tBid (data not shown). Recently, it was reported that OPA1 requires Mfn1 to promote mitochondrial fusion (23Cipolat S. de Brito O.M. Dal Zilio B. Scorrano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 15927-15932Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Thus, mitochondria isolated from cells in which Mfn1 expression had been knocked down using siRNA were also investigated. Although mitochondria from Mfn1 knock down cells, Mfn1(-) mitochondria, were also fragmented as expected (24Sugioka R. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52726-52734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5), Mfn1(-) mitochondria did not exhibit a complete release of cytochrome c at lower concentrations of tBid and did not show any differences in release as compared with control cells (Fig. 4). Thus, the effects of loss of OPA1 on cytochrome c release are not due to a general effect of increased mitochondrial fragmentation. We studied the role of OPA1 loss on the release kinetics of cytochrome c more precisely using HeLa cells stably expressing cytochrome c-GFP (13Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). To assess the duration of cytochrome c release, the S.D. of the average brightness of all the pixels in the image of individual cells was measured. In this paradigm the S.D. is high under conditions of punctate fluorescence (e.g. when cytochrome c is within mitochondria) and low when fluorescence is diffuse, as occurs after cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm (13Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). As in OPA1(-) HeLa cells, knock down of OPA1 expression using siRNA in HeLa cells stably expressing cytochrome c-GFP also led to mitochondrial fragmentation and alteration of the cristae structure in comparison to control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 6A). Kinetic studies performed by analyzing OPA1 siRNA cells every 30 s revealed that the release of cytochrome c-GFP from all mitochondria occurred over a period of ∼3.5 min (Fig. 6, B and C; see also Supplemental Video S1) regardless of the cell death signal used (actinomycin D or staurosporine), whereas complete release took ∼5 min in control cells (Fig. 6, B and C; see also Supplemental Video S2), with the latter result similar to that previously reported by Goldstein et al. (13Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In contrast, although siRNA-mediated knock down of Mfn1 in HeLa cells stably expressing cytochrome c-GFP triggered mitochondrial fragmentation without modifying the internal cristae structure (Fig. 6A), it did not increase the rate of cytochrome c-GFP release, which occurred over ∼5 min (Fig. 6, B and C; Supplemental Video S3), similar to that in control cells. In fact, the OPA1-dependent changes in cytochrome c release kinetics presented in Fig. 6 are probably underestimated, since in both control and Mfn1(-) cells the endogenous OPA1 is still being released. Overall, these findings are consistent with our in vitro results (Fig. 4), indicating that loss of OPA1, but not of Mfn1, from mitochondria facilitates the rapid and complete release of cytochrome c. Thus, this effect is likely due specifically to effects of OPA1 on cristae structure and not on its effect of promoting mitochondrial fusion. Insights into Mechanisms of Rapid and Complete Cytochrome c Release and Mitochondrial Fragmentation during Apoptosis—Mitochondrial fusion is blocked close in time downstream to Bax/Bak-mediated MOMP, 3D. Arnoult, unpublished observations. suggesting that inhibition of the fusion machinery is involved in mitochondrial fragmentation during PCD, in concert with an increase in Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission (15Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrating that OPA1, a dynamin-like GTPase required for mitochondrial fusion (5Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 8Bossy-Wetzel E. Barsoum M.J. Godzik A. Schwarzenbacher R. Lipton S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), is released from mitochondria during PCD before mitochondrial fragmentation provides a compelling mechanism for these observed changes in fusion. Another significant finding in this study is that loss of OPA1 accelerates cytochrome c release, which might account for the rapid and complete release seen during PCD. In fact, it has been estimated that only ∼15% of the total mitochondrial cytochrome c is typically available in the intermembrane space (25Bernardi P. Azzone G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7187-7192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the remaining cytochrome c sequestered across narrow junctions within mitochondrial cristae. However, it is well known that the complete release of cytochrome c is a rapid event during PCD (13Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). To explain this dichotomy, it has been suggested that mitochondrial cristae remodeling and exposure of these pools occurs but through an unknown mechanism (9Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). In fact, more recent studies have reported that OPA1 is involved in maintaining proper mitochondrial cristae structure (19Griparic L. van der Wel N.N. Orozco I.J. Peters P.J. van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18792-18798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 21Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7743-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). When we studied the effects of OPA1 loss on cytochrome c release, we observed in OPA1(-) mitochondria that, once started, release reached completion more rapidly. These findings suggest that mitochondrial cristae rearrangements mediated by the loss of OPA1 participate in the release of cytochrome c. Last, in both intact cells and in vitro, OPA1 was co-released with cytochrome c. Thus, we propose a model whereby the first leak of OPA1 (along with cytochrome c) as a consequence of MOMP results in alterations in cristae structure and exposure of additional pools of OPA1 and cytochrome c, permitting subsequent release in a feed-forward reaction to completion. A very recent study has reported that mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in OPA1 through RNA-mediated interference had impaired mitochondrial fusion (26Chen H. Chomyn A. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26185-26192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), in agreement with our results. These fibroblasts also exhibited severe cellular defects, including poor cell growth, widespread heterogeneity of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and decreased cellular respiration (26Chen H. Chomyn A. Chan D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 26185-26192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), suggesting that mitochondrial fusion per se is important for mitochondrial function. In the context of PCD, the mitochondrial deficiency of OPA1 after its release into the cytoplasm may, thus, participate in the ΔΨm loss and decreased respiration that are observed during PCD (7Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar). Although our model supports the notion that mitochondrial fragmentation can occur from the release of OPA1 after MOMP, data from some other studies initially appear inconsistent. For example, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of Drp1, a dynamin-like GTPase involved in mitochondrial fission and fragmentation (5Karbowski M. Youle R.J. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 870-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 8Bossy-Wetzel E. Barsoum M.J. Godzik A. Schwarzenbacher R. Lipton S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), inhibits cytochrome c release during PCD (15Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in agreement with Gao et al. (16Gao W. Pu Y. Luo K.Q. Chang D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Esseiva et al. (17Esseiva A.C. Chanez A.L. Bochud-Allemann N. Martinou J.-C. Hemphill A. Schneider A. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 268-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we directly observed that mitochondrial morphology changes occur several minutes after the complete release of cytochrome c, suggesting that mitochondrial fragmentation may in fact not be involved in the release of cytochrome c and that the observed effects of dominant-negative Drp1 on release are due perhaps to other alterations in mitochondrial structure or function. Indeed, Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission occurs continually in cells under normal conditions, without evidence of cytochrome c release (6Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2005; 433: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mitochondrial network in cells overexpressing the dominant-negative of Drp1 is very long and interconnected, and since cristae remodeling is important for the complete release of cytochrome c (9Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), impairment in such remodeling in the elongated, fused mitochondria might prevent the complete release of cytochrome c. Concordant with the notion that mitochondrial fragmentation itself does not seem to be involved in the release of cytochrome c (whereas it may sensitize to cell death as we have recently reported (27Lee Y.-j. Jeong S.-Y. Karbowski M. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5001-5011Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar)), we did not observe any effects of knock down of Mfn1 expression on its release, although the mitochondria were similarly fragmented as in OPA1(-) cells. In contrast to mitochondria from OPA1(-) cells, however, the cristae of mitochondria from Mfn1(-) cells do not show any obvious structural changes as compared with control mitochondria, supporting our proposal that cristae remodeling may be necessary and sufficient for the complete release of cytochrome c. In summary, our findings support a model in which MOMP and cytochrome c release precede mitochondrial fragmentation during PCD. The mitochondrial release of OPA1, a mitochondrial intermembrane space protein involved in maintaining cristae structure and required for mitochondrial fusion, facilitates the release of cytochrome c and itself through cristae remodeling in a feed-forward manner. The resultant loss of OPA1 from mitochondria as a consequence of its release inhibits mitochondrial fusion, thus promoting the characteristic mitochondrial fragmentation observed during PCD.

ADRP, proposed to regulate fatty acid mobilization and lipid droplet formation, is linked to lipid accumulation in foam cells of human atherosclerotic lesions. In this report, we show that ADRP protein accumulates in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblastic cells cultured in the presence of oleic acid but is destabilized when fatty acid sources are removed from culture serum. The latter effect was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG132, whereas inhibitors of other proteolytic processes were ineffective. Pulse-chase experiments confirmed that ADRP degradation is inhibited by MG132. Conditions that stimulate ADRP degradation also promoted the covalent modification of ADRP by ubiquitin, whereas the addition of oleic acid to culture media, which promotes triacylglycerol deposition, blunted the appearance of ubiquitinated-ADRP. Treatment with MG132 increased the levels of ADRP associated with lipid droplets, as well as throughout the cytosol. Finally, we demonstrate that the disappearance of ADRP protein after the onset of perilipin expression during adipocyte differentiation is due to degradation by proteasomes Thus, proteolytic degradation of ADRP mediated through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway appears to be a major mode for the post-translational regulation of ADRP.

Lipolysis in adipocytes is governed primarily by a protein kinase A-mediated reaction. Non-protein kinase A-phosphorylated perilipin protects TAG from hydrolysis and thus promotes TAG storage (19Brasaemle D.L. Rubin B. Harten I.A. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol.

However phosphorylation of perilipin is required for the translocation of hormone-sensitive lipase from the cytosol to the lipid droplet surface (17Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Because migration of hormone-sensitive lipase largely determines lipolytic activation in adipocytes, stimulation of lipolysis is strongly blunted in isolated primary adipocytes that lack perilipin or in whole perilipin-null animals (21Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Inoguchi T. Ikuyama S. Taniguchi S. Kobayashi K. Nakashima N. Nawata H. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E775-E783Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A recent study has revealed that ADRP mRNA is induced in human monocytes or macrophages by either oxidized (31Wang X. Reape T.J. Li X. Rayner K. Webb C.L. Burnand K.G. Lysko P.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or enzymatically modified (29Buechler C. Ritter M. Duong C.Q. Orso E. Kapinsky M. Schmitz G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) low density lipoprotein and is highly expressed in a subset of lipid-rich foam cells of human atherosclerotic lesions (31Wang X. Reape T.J. Li X. Rayner K. Webb C.L. Burnand K.G. Lysko P.G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). By contrast, perilipin mRNA is induced in foam cells of ruptured, but not of stable, human atherosclerotic plaques (32Faber B.C. Cleutjens K.B. Niessen R.L. Aarts P.L. Boon W. Greenberg A.S. Kitslaar P.J. Tordoir J.H. Daemen M.J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, the lipid droplet-associated proteins such as ADRP and perilipin are likely potential regulators for lipid accumulation of foam cells and destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque. Although the PAT family proteins appear to play important roles in lipid metabolism, there are few studies on the regulation of these proteins; most available evidence points toward a post-translational regulation of ADRP. The ubiquitin/proteasome pathway is a potential mechanism for such regulation. Ubiquitin is an 8-kDa peptide of 76 amino acids that is ubiquitous in eukaryotes. Typically, ubiquitin or a polyubiquitin chain is covalently conjugated with the targeted protein to form polyubiquitinated protein complexes, which are delivered to and degraded by the 26 S proteasome, a 2000-kDa ATP-dependent proteolytic particle (33Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2727-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 34Wilkinson K.D. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1933-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Wilkinson K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). If proteins fold improperly or form incorrect oligomeric structures, they may become conjugated to ubiquitin and proteasomally degraded (33Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2727-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 35Wilkinson K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In the cellular response to environmental changes, the ubiquitin/proteasome system has been shown to regulate degradation of transcription factors, cell cycle proteins, tumor suppressors, and cell surface receptors, as well as proteins that are damaged or improperly localized (34Wilkinson K.D. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1933-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that a major mode for the post-translational regulation of ADRP is degradation via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Reagents—Unless otherwise noted, all chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma. Proteasome or protease inhibitors MG132, lactacystin, ALLN, calpeptin, and leupeptin were purchased from Calbiochem. Geneticin (G418) and DNA transfection reagents came from Invitrogen. [35S]Methionine and an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit were products of Amersham Biosciences. Methionine-free DMEM is a product of BioFluids (Rockville, MD). Rabbit and goat anti-mouse ADRP polyclonal sera were raised against a peptide composed of the N-terminal 26 amino acid residues of murine ADRP. Rabbit anti-ubiquitin antibody, agarose-conjugated protein A/G plus mixture, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch. Cells Culture and Expression of ADRP in CHO Cells—Chinese hamster ovary fibroblastic cells (CHO-K1, ATTC) were maintained in F12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Full-length mouse ADRP cDNA was subcloned in the pcDNA3.1 vector and transfected into CHO cells using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). After selection in 1500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for four generations, cells that stably expressed ADRP (CHO-ADRP) were maintained in 10% FCS-F12 medium in the presence of 300 μg/ml G418. For transient ADRP expression, CHO cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus-expressing murine ADRP (Ad-ADRP). This vector was constructed according to a previously described method (17Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). For lipid loading, oleic acid was added to the culture medium at 400 μmol as a 5:1 molar complex with bovine serum albumin. For delipidation experiments, cells were cultured in medium containing 10% charcoal-delipidated FCS (Sigma). Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were washed twice, lysed in sample buffer, diluted 1:1 with 2× SDS loading buffer, and heated to ∼95 °C for 5 min. Equivalent amounts of protein were loaded, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies against ADRP followed by incubation for 1 h with specific secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit. Northern Blot Analysis—CHO cells were grown to 80% confluence, and total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Thirty μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane, separated in 1% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membranes. 32P-Labeled ADRP cDNA probe was prepared with the Rediprime DNA random labeling system (Amersham Biosciences), and unincorporated nucleotides were removed through a G-50 desalting spin column. The membrane was baked for 2 h at 80°C prior to prehybridization. The hybridization procedures were performed in the presence of 32P-labeled ADRP cDNA probe in Ultrahyb solution (Ambion) at 42 °C. ADRP mRNA bands were detected by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation—Cells grown in 60-mm diameter dishes were washed twice with PBS buffer and lysed in 1 ml of cold RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 2 mm EDTA) with proteases inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml ALLN, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). After addition of the lysis buffer, the dishes were incubated on ice for 20 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min to pellet cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and precleared with 30 μl of agarose-protein A/G plus mixture for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitation reaction was performed at 4 °C for 2 h on a rotator in 1 ml of the precleared supernatant upon addition of rabbit anti-ADRP antibody at 1:500 or rabbit anti-ubiquitin at 1:200 and 30 μl of agarose-protein A/G plus mixture. Rabbit polyclonal serum against hormone-sensitive lipase or rabbit preimmune serum was used as the negative control. The immunoprecipitated complex was pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, washed four times with cold RIPA buffer, and finally mixed with sample buffer containing 4% SDS and 10 mm dithiothreitol. After boiling at 100 °C for 5 min, proteins in the samples were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE. For pulse-chase experiments, [35S]methionine-labeled ADRP in immunoprecipitates was detected directly by autoradiography after separation by SDS-PAGE and exposure of the dried gel to X-film for 24 h. For subsequent immunoblot analysis, the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane followed by immunoblotting with the antibodies against ADRP or ubiquitin, respectively. Pulse-Chase Experiments—Cells were grown to 90% confluence in 60-mm diameter dishes and preincubated for 30 min in methionine-free 10% FCS-DMEM to deplete cold methionine from the cells. The cells were washed once with PBS and then pulse-labeled for 5 h with 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine in warmed methionine-free DMEM-10% FCS. Pulse-labeling reaction was terminated by the addition of a 1,000-fold excess of cold methionine. After one wash with PBS, cells were subsequently chased for 0 or 5 h in serum-free F12 culture medium in the presence or absence of 400 μm oleic acid or 10 μm MG132 as indicated. The [35S]methionine-labeled ADRP reached its maximum level at the end point of labeling and then declined continually during chase. At the end point of the chase, the chase medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 1 ml of cold RIPA buffer. [35S]Methionine-labeled ADRP was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-ADRP antibodies and then separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. The density of bands was quantified by densitometry and analyzed using the NIH Image program. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Imaging—Cells were treated in glass slide chambers and fixed for 15 min with 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS buffer at room temperature followed by three washes for 10 min each with PBS. Nonspecific binding sites in the cells were blocked with 2% donkey serum for 30–60 min and washed for three times for 5 min each. The cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal serum against ADRP at 1:500 overnight at 4 °C and subsequently with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti rabbit IgG at 1:100 for 1 h in the dark at room temperature (17Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Intracellular lipid storage droplets were easily visible under Nomarski optics/differential interference contrast, and the immunofluorescent signal of ADRP was observed using a Zeiss SCM510 confocal microscope. Quantification of Total Triacyglycerols—Cells grown in 6-well plates were treated with or without 2.5 μm MG132 for 24 h, rinsed with PBS buffer, and scraped into extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA. The cells were lysed with three freeze-thaw cycles, and total lipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol (2:1) as described previously (36Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mass of total triacylglycerols from triplicate samples was measured by OD at 340 nm using a commercial kit (Sigma) and normalized to total cellular protein content measured by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 (ATCC) fibroblastic cells (preadipocytes) were grown to confluence in 12-well plate and maintained for another 24 h in DMEM containing 10% FCS. The confluent 3T3-L1 cells (day 0) were differentiated for 3 days in 10% FCS-DMEM containing 0.5 mm IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine), 10 μm dexamethasone, 1 μg/ml insulin, and 8 μg/ml biotin. The differentiation medium was changed daily, and replaced with regular medium at day 3 after initiating the differentiation program. The differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were maintained in fresh 10% FCS-DMEM. At day 8 of differentiation, the 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated for 18 h with 5 μm MG132. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. A oneway analysis of variance Tukey's test was performed for statistical analysis using GraphPad Prism version 4.0, and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Fatty Acid Loading Promotes Intracellular Lipid Droplet Formation and ADRP Accumulation—We showed previously that CHO cells cultured with the free fatty acid oleic acid (OA) increased TAG storage, with little deposition of OA into other lipid fractions (20Tansey J.T. Huml A.M. Vogt R. Davis K.E. Jones J.M. Fraser K.A. Brasaemle D.L. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8401-8406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To determine whether these growth conditions additionally altered the expression of ADRP, we cultured CHO cells for 48 h in the absence or presence of 400 μm OA and assessed ADRP protein levels by immunofluorescent imaging and confocal microscopy as well as by immunoblotting. Relatively few and tiny lipid droplets (Fig. 1A) were present in CHO cells cultured in the absence of OA. After incubation for 48 h with 400 μm OA, both the number and size of the intracellular lipid storage droplets were significantly increased. We also observed enhanced ADRP immunofluorescence associated with the lipid droplets in cells cultured with OA (Fig. 1A). Increased ADRP protein expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B). Increases in intracellular lipid droplet storage and ADRP accumulation were observed by 12 h after the loading with OA (data not shown). Thus, increases in ADRP protein accumulation paralleled the increase in neutral lipid deposition. Delipidation Induces Down-regulation of ADRP by a Process Blocked by Proteasomal Inhibitors—Delipidation of serum removes lipid precursors and deprives cells of fatty acid precursors that are required for lipid droplet accumulation (9Brasaemle D.L. Barber T. Wolins N.E. Serrero G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2249-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results from Fig. 1 indicate that ADRP protein accumulation was promoted by the increase in intracellular lipid storage. We were interested to determine whether ADRP protein levels would be reduced upon the removal of lipid precursors from the culture media. To enhance ADRP detection, we utilized CHO cells that express ADRP from an adenovirus vector. The linkage of lipid deposition and ADRP expression is highlighted in Fig. 2A. Incubation of the cells for 24 h in culture medium containing 10% calf serum that had been delipidated with charcoal led to a substantial decrease of ADRP protein in comparison with nondelipidated control cells. By contrast, culturing cells in delipidated medium that was supplemented with 400 μm oleic acid prevented the decline in ADRP protein (Fig. 2A). Thus, ADRP appears to be degraded when TAG accumulation is inhibited. To determine whether proteasomal activity is involved in ADRP degradation, we treated the cells with MG132, a specific inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome. Clearly, MG132 promoted ADRP accumulation in cells deprived of lipid precursors (Fig. 2A). Moreover, under nondelipidation conditions, we observed that MG132 elevated ADRP protein in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). The MG132-stabilizing effect was evident at 0.625 μm MG132 and maximal at ∼2 μm (Fig. 2B). These results provide strong support that ADRP is degraded through a proteasomal pathway. We investigated the effects of ADRP degradation using a series of protease inhibitors (37Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). It has been well established that MG132 specifically inhibits the 26 S proteasome and that lactacystin is specific for the 20 S proteasome (37Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 38Mimnaugh E.G. Bonvini P. Neckers L. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ALLN is an inhibitor of both the 20 S and 26 S proteasomes and a partial inhibitor of the calpain protease. Calpeptin is specific for calpain, leupeptin inhibits trypsin-like and cysteine proteases, and chloroquine and NH4Cl are lysosomal protease inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 3A, addition of the three proteasome-specific inhibitors, MG132, lactacystin, and ALLN, significantly increased ADRP levels after treatment for 18 h. By contrast, the other protease inhibitors were ineffective in increasing ADRP protein levels (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that ADRP can be degraded through the proteasome pathway. We also examined whether proteasomal inhibitors increase ADRP protein indirectly by elevating ADRP mRNA levels. Although addition of 5 μm MG132 for 18 h significantly increased ADRP protein levels, addition of this agent did not alter ADRP mRNA levels under the same conditions (Fig. 3B). Thus, the proteasome inhibitors elevated ADRP protein by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Proteasomal Degradation of ADRP—To examine ADRP turnover more directly, we performed pulse-chase experiments. Cells were labeled for 5 h with [35S]methionine followed by a 5-h chase in the presence of unlabeled methionine with or without 10 μm MG132 or 400 μm oleic acid. 35S-Labeled ADRP was immunoprecipitated and detected by autoradiography. More than 50% of the labeled ADRP was lost during the 5-h control chase (Fig. 4, A and B). The specific proteasome inhibitors MG132 (Fig. 4A, B), lactacystin, and ALLN (data not shown), strongly (∼85%) preserved the labeled ADRP during the chase period (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas calpeptin, leupeptin, chloroquine, and NH4Cl had no effect on ADRP degradation (data not shown). These results confirmed that degradation of ADRP was specifically mediated by the proteasomal pathway. The addition of oleic acid only modestly blunted the loss of the 35S-labe"

https://openalex.org/W2140668393,"Microtubule-associated protein tau is the major component of the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer disease (AD) and is genetically linked to frontotemporal dementias (FTDP-17). We have recently shown that tau interacts with the SH3 domain of Fyn, an Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinase, and is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Fyn on Tyr-18. Also, tyrosine-phosphorylated tau is present in the neuropathology of AD. To determine whether alterations in the tau-Fyn interaction might correlate with disease-related factors in AD and FTDP-17, we have performed real-time surface plasmon resonance studies on a panel of 21 tau constructs with Fyn SH3. We report that the interaction between Fyn SH3 and 3R-tau was 20-fold higher than that with 4R-tau. In addition, the affinity between 4R-tau and Fyn SH3 was increased 25–45-fold by phosphorylation-mimicking mutations or by FTDP-17 mutations. In vitro kinase reactions show that tau, with lower affinity SH3 interactions, exhibited a lower level of Tyr-18 phosphorylation under our reaction conditions. Lastly, we have demonstrated that tau is phosphorylated on Tyr-18 in the tau P301L mouse model for tauopathy (JNPL3). In summary, our results suggest that disease-related phosphorylation and missense mutations of tau increase association of tau with Fyn. Because these effects are mediated through the 4R component of the tau population, these results also have implications for the FTDP-17 diseases caused by increased expression of 4R-tau. Our data support a role for the Fyn-tau interaction in neurodegeneration.

Our data support a role for the Fyn-tau interaction in neurodegeneration. The ability of microtubule-associated protein tau to interact with microtubules is mediated by its carboxyl-terminal domain, which contains three or four copies of a microtubule-binding motif. In the middle portion of tau is a proline-rich domain that we have previously shown to contain a PXXP motif that interacts with the SH3 domain of Src family non-receptor tyrosine kinases (1Lee G. Newman S.T. Gard D.L. Band H. Panchamoorthy G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3167-3177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human neuroblastoma cells, tau co-immunoprecipitated with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase family member Fyn, and we have recently reported that Fyn phosphorylated tau at its amino terminus (Tyr-18) (2Lee G. Thangavel R. Sharma V.M. Litersky J.M. Bhaskar K. Fang S.M. Do L.H. Andreadis A. Van Hoesen G. Ksiezak-Reding H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2304-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although this phosphorylation does not affect the ability of tau to bind microtubules, this phosphorylated form of tau is present in the neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: ADAlzheimer diseaseSPRsurface plasmon resonanceMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightGSTglutathione S-transferase. as well as in preparations of paired helical filaments from AD brain (2Lee G.

We hypothesize that the interaction between Fyn and tau may have a role in the signaling events underlying neuropathology. A role for Fyn in AD has been suggested by immunocytochemical studies showing alterations in Fyn staining in AD brain (3Shirazi S.K. Wood J.G.

Palop J.J. Yu G.-Q. Kojima N. Masliah E. Mucke L. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4692-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Also, Fyn can activate GSK3β (7Lesort M. Jope R.S. Johnson G.V.W. J.

These findings suggest Fyn as a link between amyloid and tau pathology. Alzheimer disease surface plasmon resonance matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight glutathione S-transferase. Tau pathology is also found in frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), a group of age-related neurodegenerative diseases caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the tau gene (reviewed in Refs. 9Goedert M. Jakes R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar and 10Lee V.M. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). The mutations, of which over 30 have been identified, can be divided into splice site and missense mutations (reviewed in Refs. 11D'Souza I. Schellenberg G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 104-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar and 12Hutton M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The splice site mutations predominantly result in the overexpression of mRNA encoding tau with four microtubule-binding repeats (4R-tau) relative to those with three repeats (3R-tau). As in AD, the tau lesions in FTDP-17 diseases comprise accumulations of abnormally phosphorylated tau, and many of the phosphorylated serine and threonine tau epitopes in AD have also been found in FTDP-17. In this study, we have investigated the impact of FTDP-17 mutations on the Fyn-tau interaction. Using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technique, we determined the kinetic parameters of the Fyn SH3-tau interaction for two alternatively spliced isoforms of tau (3R-tau and 4R-tau) and the effect of FTDP-17 and phosphorylation-mimicking mutations. Our results identify several functional differences between these proteins that were not present when similar assays were conducted with Src SH3. The significance of our SH3 interaction results were then tested by in vitro kinase assays; these assays indicated that the tyrosine phosphorylation of tau at Tyr-18 correlated with the SH3 domain interaction. Lastly, we determined that a mouse model of an FTDP-17 disease contained tyrosine-phosphorylated tau. Overall, our data provided evidence for the importance of the Fyn-tau interaction in the neurodegenerative process and led us to present a new hypothesis regarding the role of 4R-tau in disease. Expression of Recombinant Tau—Human tau with 3- or 4-microtubule-binding repeats (352- or 383-residue isoforms) were subcloned into either pET-3d or pET-17b vectors (Novagen, Madison, WI) for bacterial protein expression using standard techniques. The following mutations were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (Fig. 1): 1) FTDP-17 missense mutations V337M, G272V, R406W, P301L, and R5H; and 2) phosphorylation-mimicking mutations S199D, S199D/S202D, S396D, S404D, S396D/S404D, and T231D/S235D. A construct with an internal deletion of the PXXP motif (ΔP) has been previously described (1Lee G. Newman S.T. Gard D.L. Band H. Panchamoorthy G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3167-3177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. tau proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as previously described (13Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity and size of wild type and mutant tau proteins were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF, showing homogeneous preparations of the expected molecular weights (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Prior to SPR analysis, protein was desalted, degassed, and equilibrated in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20). Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay. Each protein was freshly diluted to obtain different concentrations using HBS-EP buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol prior to SPR analysis. GST-Fyn SH3 and GST-Src SH3 fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For SPR, GST-Fyn SH3 and GST-Src SH3 were used at 10 μg/ml in HBS-EP buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Surface Plasmon Resonance—SPR experiments were performed at 25 °C using the BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Goat anti-GST antibody was immobilized on two flow cells (FC1 and FC2) of a CM4 sensor chip by amine coupling at pH 5.0 in 10 mm sodium acetate, according to BIAcore instructions. Approximately 6200 resonance units corresponding to 6.2 ng/mm2 goat anti-GST antibody was immobilized on each surface. A blank surface (FC3) was made by ethanolamine deactivation of the activated dextran surface. For SPR, GST fusion proteins were diluted to 10 μg/ml in HBS-EP buffer and injected into FC2. This resulted in 150–200 resonance units on the surface matrix, corresponding to 150–200pg/mm2 of GST fusion protein bound to the GST antibody in FC2. Next, purified tau protein was injected on all three flow cells (FC1, -2, and -3) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min and resonance units measured. After each binding cycle, the surfaces were regenerated with 10 mm glycine (pH 2.2) to remove the GST fusion protein + Tau complex from the antibody surface. The first flow cell (FC1) was the minus GST protein control channel and was subtracted from the sample channel (FC2) during the run. Bulk refractive index contributions were therefore expected to be 0 or not significant in reference-subtracted sensorgrams. To obtain the association constant (on-rate or ka) and the dissociation constant (off-rate or kd), the interaction between GST fusion protein and different tau constructs was measured at tau concentrations of 1250, 1000, 750, 500, and 250 nm. To correct for nonspecific binding, blank runs were performed with HBS-EP buffer on all three surfaces before and after each binding analysis; this value was subtracted prior to kinetic analysis. The resulting sensorgrams were analyzed using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model in the BIAevaluation version 3.1 software program (BIAcore Inc.). Quality of the kinetic fit was determined by the residuals and the χ2 values (supplemental Fig. S3). Kinetic constants ka and kd were calculated by local fit analysis. The apparent equilibrium association constants (KA = ka/kd) and the dissociation constants (KD = kd/ka) were calculated from the ka and kd values for each tau concentration. All interaction analyses were repeated three times. TABLES ONE and TWO show average KD values (mean ± S.D.); kinetic constants, ka and kd and KA are shown in the supplemental material (Tables S1 and S2). Differences in KD values for tau mutants were analyzed for significance by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test.TABLE ONEEquilibrium dissociation constants for tau and GST-Fyn SH3 interactionTau construct3R-tau4R-tauKD (μm)Wild type0.326 ± 0.086.77 ± 0.5ap < 0.001 versus wild type 3R-tau.ΔP4.0 ± 0.7ap < 0.001 versus wild type 3R-tau.NDT231D/S235D2.8 ± 0.4ap < 0.001 versus wild type 3R-tau.NDS202D31.0 ± 8.0ap < 0.001 versus wild type 3R-tau.0.26 ± 0.06bp < 0.001 versus wild type 4R-tau.S199D/S202D25.0 ± 1ap < 0.001 versus wild type 3R-tau.0.16 ± 0.01bp < 0.001 versus wild type 4R-tau.S396D0.2 ± 0.2NDcND, not determined.S404DNDcND, not determined.0.15 ± 0bp < 0.001 versus wild type 4R-tau., dS.D. is <0.01.S396D/S404D0.29 ± 0.030.16 ± 0.08bp < 0.001 versus wild type 4R-tau.V337M0.17 ± 0.040.18 ± 0.06bp < 0.001 versus wild type 4R-tau.G272V0.19 ± 0.010.18 ± 0.05bp < 0.001 versus wild type 4R-tau.R406W0.20 ± 0dS.D. is <0.01.0.15 ± 0.02bp < 0.001 versus wild type 4R-tau.R5H0.13 ± 0.020.17 ± 0.03bp < 0.001 versus wild type 4R-tau.P301LNDcND, not determined.0.16 ± 0.09bp < 0.001 versus wild type 4R-tau.a p < 0.001 versus wild type 3R-tau.b p < 0.001 versus wild type 4R-tau.c ND, not determined.d S.D. is <0.01.

Rockwood J. Melrose H. Nacharaju P. Van Slegtenhorst M. Gwinn-Hardy K. Murphy P.M. Baker M. Yu X. Duff K. Hardy J. Corral A. Lin W.L. Yen S.H. Dickson D.W. Davies P. Hutton M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Sections were sequentially immunostained, first with TG3 (1:10, generously provided by Dr. Peter Davis (15Jicha G.A. Lane E. Vincent I. Otvos Jr., L. Hoffmann R. Davies P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2087-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar)) or AT8 (1:200, Pierce) followed by 9G3-biotin. Rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgM or IgG secondary antibodies were used for TG3 or AT8 detection. Alexa-488-conjugated streptavidin (1:200, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used for 9G3 detection. Sections were visualized using the Nikon E800 microscope. 9G3-biotin was prepared using the EZ-Link NHS-PEO solid phase biotinylation kit (Pierce). 3R-tau Binds to Fyn SH3 with a Higher Affinity than 4R-tau—To investigate the interaction between Fyn and tau, we used SPR spectroscopy to quantitate the interaction between tau and the SH3 domain of Fyn. We started by comparing two wild type tau proteins that are generated by alternative splicing. Adult human brain expresses both 3R-tau and 4R-tau, whereas fetal human expresses only 3R-tau. In this study, we have used the shortest 3R-tau and 4R-tau isoforms. Neither contain inserts at the amino terminus and differ only in the number of microtubule-binding repeats. The real-time interaction between 3R-tau and GST-Fyn SH3 was measured at 25 °C by sequentially injecting proteins onto sensor chip surfaces with immobilized goat anti-GST antibody. SPR responses of injected tau were recorded with and without a prior injection of GST-Fyn SH3. Prior to kinetic analysis, the tau-alone control response was subtracted from the tau-plus GST-Fyn SH3 response. Our data indicated that 3R-tau interacted with GST-Fyn SH3 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 0.32 μm (TABLE ONE, representative SPR sensorgram shown in Fig. 2). This value was the average of five KD values calculated from the measured kinetic rates of association (ka) and dissociation (kd) measured at five tau concentrations (average ka and kd values are shown in supplemental Tables S1 and S2). It should be noted that the value of KD is inversely proportional to the affinity between interacting proteins and that, therefore, a lower KD indicates a higher affinity between two interacting partners. Our previous data obtained by GST “pull-down” assay identified a 233PXXP motif in tau that interacted with the SH3 domain of Fyn (1Lee G. Newman S.T. Gard D.L. Band H. Panchamoorthy G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3167-3177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SPR analysis confirmed that the 3R-tau mutant lacking the 233PXXP motif (ΔP) interacted very poorly with GST-Fyn SH3. The interaction displayed 12-fold lower affinity (KD = 4 μm) compared with that of 3R-tau (TABLE ONE). In addition, we measured the interaction between Fyn SH3 and a tau mutant, where both Thr-231 and Ser-235 had been replaced with aspartic acid, thus mimicking phosphorylation at the PXXP motif. Thr-231 in tau is phosphorylated by several kinases, including GSK3β and cdk5, and the presence of phospho-Thr-231, as well as phospho-Ser-235, in AD have been shown by phospho-specific antibody probes and mass spectrometry data (reviewed Refs. 16Sergeant N.

Grundke-Iqbal I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). The interaction between Fyn SH3 and the 3R-tau-T231D/S235D mutant showed an 8-fold reduction in affinity (KD = 2.8 μm; TABLE ONE). These results confirm the importance of the PXXP motif in mediating the tau-Fyn SH3 interaction. Surprisingly, although 4R-tau interacted with GST-Fyn SH3, the affinity (KD = 6.77 μm) was 20-fold lower compared with 3R-tau (TABLE ONE, representative SPR sensorgram shown in Fig. 2). To confirm these results, we tested 4R-tau prepared from two different prokaryotic plasmids, each plasmid sequence having been confirmed by DNA sequencing and protein analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Our data indicated that the alternative splicing of tau dramatically alters the interaction of tau with Fyn. Previously, we had shown that tau also interacted with the SH3 domain of Src. Therefore, as a comparison, we also analyzed the interaction between tau and Src SH3. For 3R-tau, the interaction with Src SH3 resembled that with Fyn SH3, showing a comparable KD value of 0.17 μm (TABLE TWO). However, for 4R-tau, the interaction with the Src SH3 showed a much lower KD than for Fyn SH3 (KD = 0.26 μm for Src versus KD = 6.77 μm for Fyn), suggesting that for 4R-tau, binding to Src was preferred relative to Fyn. As measured by KD, there was no significant difference between the interaction of 3R-tau or 4R-tau with Src SH3. Therefore, the observed difference between 3R-tau and 4R-tau was specific for the tau-Fyn interaction. Amino Acid Replacements Far from the PXXP Impact on SH3 Interactions—As our data suggested that phospho-Thr-231 and phospho-Ser-235 would interfere with the association of tau with SH3, we tested two other disease-related phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1). Mass spectrometry, as well as immunocytochemical data, have also established phospho-Ser-199/202 and phospho-Ser-396/404 as abnormally phosphorylated tau sites in disease. To study the effects of phosphorylation at these sites, which are recognized by monoclonal antibodies AT8 and PHF1, respectively, we synthesized tau constructs that mimicked phosphorylation by converting Ser-199, -202, -396, and -404, either individually or in pairs, to aspartic acid. When 3R-tau was mutated to mimic phosphorylation at the AT8 site, either as a single S202D or double S199D/S202D replacement, the protein showed a significant reduction in affinity (95 and 76-fold, respectively) to the Fyn SH3 (TABLE ONE). Interestingly, an opposite effect was observed when 4R-tau carrying these same mutations were tested. 4R-S202D and 4R-S199D/S202D displayed a 26- and 42-fold increase, respectively, in affinity. Mutations in 3R-tau that mimic phosphorylation at the PHF1 site, either as a single S396D or double S396D/S404D mutant, resulted in modest differences in binding that were not statistically significant. In contrast, similar mutations introduced in 4R-tau (4R-S404D and 4R-S396D/S404D) displayed 45- and 42-fold increases in affinity, respectively (TABLE ONE). Therefore, although 3R-tau phosphorylation-mimicking mutants have either decreased or unchanged binding affinities to Fyn SH3, similar 4R mutants have enhanced binding affinities. To assess whether FTDP-17 missense mutations affect the tau-Fyn interaction, we first investigated four mutations (V337M, G272V, R406W, and R5H) in 3R-tau (Fig. 1). In comparing the binding kinetics of the mutants to GST-Fyn SH3, all four mutants tested showed modest 2–3-fold increases in binding affinity that were not statistically significant. In contrast, when we investigated the same four mutants and P301L in 4R-tau, all mutants showed a significant increase in binding affinity to Fyn SH3. The affinities for the interactions with the V337M, G272V, R406W, and R5H mutants were all at least 30-fold higher than wild type 4R-tau, with the P301L mutant showing the highest increase (42-fold) (TABLE ONE). Lastly, FTDP-17 mutations, either in 3R or 4R-tau, did not significantly alter their binding to Src SH3 (TABLE TWO). In summary, the SPR data has indicated that pseudophosphorylation and FTDP-17 mutations differentially affect 3R- and 4R-tau with regards to their interaction with the Fyn SH3 domain. Our results are summarized in Fig. 3, where we have graphed the reciprocal of the KD (1/KD) as an indication of binding affinity, because the KD value reflects the rate of the dissociation of the interaction. For the graph, 1/KD was normalized to the 3R-tau-Fyn SH3 value, which was set at 100. In addition, we used the calculated mean of the KD values gathered for each group of similar modifications, because the differences between the values within each group were not statistically significant. We noted that 4R-tau binds Fyn SH3 less well than 3R-tau and that pseudophosphorylation at AT8 or PHF1 or FTDP-17 mutation increases the affinity of 4R-tau to match that of unmodified 3R-tau (Fig. 3, left). In contrast, 3R-tau was affected only by pseudophosphorylation at AT8, which resulted in a decrease in affinity. The differences noted between the splicing isoforms and for the FTDP-17 mutations were not found for the Src SH3 interaction (Fig. 3, right). 233PXXP Motif in Tau Is Essential for Tyr-18 Phosphorylation by Fyn or Src Kinase—A functional consequence of SH3 domain interactions for Fyn or Src might be to direct substrates to the catalytic domain of the kinase (19Weng Z. Thomas S.M. Rickles R.J. Taylor J.A. Brauer A.W. Seidel-Dugan C. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4509-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Using co-transfected COS cells, we have recently determined that Tyr-18 in human tau was phosphorylated by Fyn and Src (2Lee G. Thangavel R. Sharma V.M. Litersky J.M. Bhaskar K. Fang S.M. Do L.H. Andreadis A. Van Hoesen G. Ksiezak-Reding H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2304-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). If the interaction between tau and the SH3 domain of Fyn or Src was critical for the phosphorylation of Tyr-18 of tau, in vitro phosphorylation of Tyr-18 might be expected to be consistent with the SPR results. Therefore, to extend our understanding of the functional significance of the tau-SH3 domain interaction, we performed in vitro kinase reactions with wild type tau and tau mutants using Fyn or Src kinases and a phospho-Tyr-18-specific antibody (anti-PY18) to detect the tyrosine phosphorylation of tau (2Lee G. Thangavel R. Sharma V.M. Litersky J.M. Bhaskar K. Fang S.M. Do L.H. Andreadis A. Van Hoesen G. Ksiezak-Reding H. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2304-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). When the 3R-tau ΔP mutant was used as a substrate for Fyn, there was a decrease in PY18 (Fig. 4, lane 2). To quantitate the level of phosphorylation, we measured the ratio of PY18 to total tau. This parameter indicated that ΔP was phosphorylated 15-fold less than wild type tau (Fig. 4). Similarly, the T231D/S235D mutant was phosphorylated 12-fold less than wild type tau (Fig. 4, lane 3). Assays performed with Src on the ΔP and T231D/S235D proteins similarly showed 19- and 4-fold less PY18, respectively (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). The correlation between these results and the SPR data suggest that the in vitro phosphorylation of tau at Tyr-18 by Fyn or Src kinase is strongly dependent on the interaction between the PXXP motif and the SH3 domain. Because 3R-ΔP and 3R-T231D/S235D proteins showed a positive correlation between SH3 binding and Tyr-18 phosphorylation, one might anticipate that the 4R-tau and FTDP-17 mutants would exhibit similar results. However, when kinase reactions were carried out with these proteins under the same conditions as above (reaction incubation time of 6 h), we found minimal differences between 3R-tau, 4R-tau, and FTDP-17 mutants (data not shown). We then considered the fact that, although the ΔP and T231D/S235D proteins had alterations that directly impacted on the site of interaction between Fyn and tau, the inclusion of exon 10 in 4R-tau and the FTDP-17 mutations represented changes that were all located some distance away from the PXXP motif (Fig. 1). In addition, because SPR data is derived from real-time binding measurements, the 6-h incubation condition might not reflect kinetic effects exerted by indirect conformational alterations. Moreover, we had noted that all of the changes in KD had resulted from changes in the measured rate of association (ka). Thus, we performed a time course of phosphorylation to determine whether the inclusion of exon 10 or the FTDP-17 mutations might affect the phosphorylation of Tyr-18 primarily during the initial stages of the reaction. By terminating the Fyn kinase reaction after 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 60, and 240 min of incubation, we found that the levels of phosphorylation, as determined by the ratio of PY18 to total tau, were higher for 3R-tau than 4R-tau (Fig. 5A). The measured differences were statistically significant, as determined by unpaired t test. In addition, although phosphorylation of the 3R-V337M mutant was similar to 3R-tau (Fig. 5B), the 4R-R406W and P301L mutants had significantly higher levels of phosphorylation when compared with 4R-tau (Fig. 5C). These findings support our SPR results. Tyr-18 Phosphorylated Tau in P301L Tau Transgenic Mouse Brain—Given that FTDP-17 mutations affected the tyrosine phosphorylation of tau and our previous finding that Tyr-18 of tau was phosphorylated in AD, we tested an FTDP-17 mouse model (14Lewis J.

Brain sections from an 8-month-old P301L tau transgenic mouse were probed with an antibody specific for phosphorylated Tyr-18 (9G3), whereas AT8 or TG3 were each used as a control antibody to identify tau pathology. We found 9G3 labeling in the brain stem, basal ganglia, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus, coinciding with AT8-positive neurons (Fig. 6); TG3 also labeled the same neurons as 9G3. At the subcellular level, we noted that the TG3 staining pattern was often punctate (Fig. 6, insets), as reported for the pre-tangle st"

Fibronectin matrix provides provisional tissue scaffolding during development and wound healing and is essential for the stabilization of mature extracellular matrix. Herein, we report that SPARC expression does not significantly affect fibronectin-induced cell spreading but enhances fibronectin-induced stress fiber formation and cell-mediated partial unfolding of fibronectin molecules, an essential process in fibronectin matrix assembly. By phage display, we identify integrin-linked kinase as a potential binding partner of SPARC and verify the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization in vitro. Cells lacking SPARC exhibit diminished fibronectin-induced integrin-linked kinase activation and integrin-linked kinase-dependent cell-contractile signaling. Furthermore, induced expression of SPARC in SPARC-null fibroblasts restores fibronectin-induced integrin-linked kinase activation, downstream signaling, and fibronectin unfolding. These data further confirm the function of SPARC in extracellular matrix organization and identify a novel mechanism by which SPARC regulates extracellular matrix assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2156817782,"Two major isoforms of the Runx2 gene are expressed by alternative promoter usage: Runx2 type I (Runx2-I) is derived from the proximal promoter (P2), and Runx2 type II (Runx2-II) is produced by the distal promoter (P1). Our previous results indicate that Dlx5 mediates BMP-2-induced Runx2 expression and osteoblast differentiation (Lee, M.-H., Kim, Y-J., Kim, H-J., Park, H-D., Kang, A-R., Kyung, H.-M., Sung, J-H., Wozney, J. M., Kim, H-J., and Ryoo, H-M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 34387-34394). However, little is known of the molecular mechanisms by which Dlx5 up-regulates Runx2 expression in BMP-2 signaling. Here, Runx2-II expression was found to be specifically stimulated by BMP-2 treatment or by Dlx5 overexpression. In addition, BMP-2, Dlx5, and Runx2-II were found to be expressed in osteogenic fronts and parietal bones of the developing cranial vault and Runx2-I and Msx2 in the sutural mesenchyme. Furthermore, Runx2 P1 promoter activity was strongly stimulated by Dlx5 overexpression, whereas Runx2 P2 promoter activity was not. Runx2 P1 promoter deletion analysis indicated that the Dlx5-specific response is due to sequences between -756 and -342 bp of the P1 promoter, where three Dlx5-response elements are located. Dlx5 responsiveness to these elements was confirmed by gel mobility shift assay and site-directed mutagenesis. Moreover, Msx2 specifically suppressed the Runx2 P1 promoter, and the responsible region overlaps with that recognized by Dlx5. In summary, Dlx5 specifically transactivates the Runx2 P1 promoter, and its action on the P1 promoter is antagonized by Msx2.

More recently, upstream exons of the Runx2 gene that potentially encode the N termini of Runx2 isoforms expressed in osteoblasts have been identified (5Geoffroy V. Corral D.A. Zhou L. Lee B.

These upstream exons contain a 5′-untranslated region and encode the N-terminal 19 amino acids of Runx2 type II (Runx2-II; also referred to as Cbfa1/p57 and OSF2), which starts with the sequence MASNSL (7Stewart M. Terry A. Hu M. O'Hara M. Blyth K. Baxter E. Cameron E. Onions D.E. Neil J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8646-8651Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This isoform is expressed from the P1 or “bone-related” upstream promoter (8Drissi H. Luc Q. Shakoori R. Chuva De Sousa Lopes S. Choi J.-Y. Terry A. Hu M. Jones S. Neil J.C. Lian J.B. Stein J.L.

The alternative promoter usage strongly implies that the expression pattern of each isoform differs temporally and/or spatially. Indeed, they exhibit distinct expression patterns during bone development (10Park M.H. Shin H.I. Choi J.-Y. Nam S.H. Kim Y.-J. Kim H.-J. Ryoo H.-M. J. Bone Miner.

Thus, it is natural to assume that these two promoters differently respond to different extracellular signals or their downstream transcription factors because these promoters have distinct transcription factor-binding sites.

We found that the homeobox gene Dlx5 is an upstream target of BMP-2 signaling and that it plays a pivotal role in stimulating the downstream osteogenic master transcription factor Runx2. In turn, Runx2 acts simultaneously or sequentially to induce the expression of bone-specific genes that represent BMP-2-induced osteogenic trans-differentiation. In addition, it has also been suggested that Dlx5 is a critical target of the inhibitory action of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) on BMP-2-induced osteoblast trans-differentiation (14Lee M.-H.

Several lines of in vivo evidence indicate that the Dlx and Msx families of homeodomain proteins include regulatory factors that preferentially support skeletal tissue differentiation. Among them, Dlx5 is a bone-inducing transcription factor that is expressed in the later stages of osteoblast differentiation (15Ryoo H.-M. Hoffmann H.M. Beumer T. Frenkel B. Towler D.A. Stein G.S.

These results strongly suggest that Dlx5 plays important roles in the development of mineralized tissues. Another homeodomain protein that plays critical roles in bone formation and osteoblast differentiation (Msx2) is also induced by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (18Harada S. Rodan G.A. Nature. 2003; 423: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Several in vitro studies have shown that Msx2 negatively regulates the transcription of osteoblast-specific genes such as osteocalcin (15Ryoo H.-M. Hoffmann H.M. Beumer T. Frenkel B. Towler D.A.

This was further supported by findings that the Dlx5 and Msx2 proteins bind the promoters of osteoblast markers and appear to have opposing transcriptional properties because Msx2 functions as a transcriptional repressor (20Newberry E.P.

Dlx5 is the key mediator of BMP-induced Runx2 expression (14Lee M.-H. Kim Y.-J. Kim H.-J. Park H.-D. Kang A.-R. Kyung H.-M. Sung J.-H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.-J. Ryoo H.-M. J. Biol.

Therefore, the first aim of this study was to assess which promoter responds to BMP signaling because Runx2 has two major isoforms whose expression is regulated by alternative promoters. In addition, as Dlx5 acts downstream of BMP-2, we undertook to define cis-acting elements in the BMP-2-responsive Runx2 promoter that interact with Dlx5. Finally, as Msx2 is thought to inhibit the Dlx5-induced expression of osteoblast marker genes (20Newberry E.P. Latifi T. Towler D.A.

Here, we demonstrate that Dlx5 up-regulates Runx2 (more specifically, Runx2-II) expression and that the effect of Dlx5 on the Runx2 P1 promoter is antagonized by Msx2.

The mouse Runx2 P1 promoter (-2782 to +112 bp) and the Runx2 P2 promoter (-4056 to +246 bp) were generated based on GenBank™ accession numbers AF155360 (from 1784 to 4677 bp) and AF155361 (from 1 to 4303 bp), respectively.

For the first set of PCRs, three mutant primers designated MTD1 (-661 to -616 bp), MTD2 (-591 to -537 bp), and MTD3 (-399 to -352 bp) (TABLE ONE) were used as the forward primers, and the GL2 primer (Promega Corp.) was used as the reverse primer to create Runx2-MTD1, Runx2-MTD2, and Runx2-MTD3, respectively, using the Runx2 P1-756 construct as a template. In the second round of PCR, the RV3 primer (Promega Corp.) was used as the forward primer, and PCR products from the first round were used as the reverse primers with P1-756 as a template. The cycling parameters for PCR were as follows: 94 °C for 60 s, 48 °C for 1 min (first round) or 44 °C for 1 min (second round), and 72 °C for 2 min for 35 cycles, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products with mutated binding sites were digested with KpnI/PstI, and the resulting 868-bp fragments were ligated to pGL3-Basic. Derivatives with two or three mutated sites were constructed using combinations of each mutant construct described above. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing (Macrogen, Seoul). In Situ Hybridization—Probe preparation (BMP-2, Dlx5, Msx2, Runx2-I, and Runx2-II), tissue preparation, and in situ hybridization procedures were as described previously (10Park M.H. Shin H.I.

Transfection and Luciferase Assay—C2C12, ROS17/2.8, and Runx2-/- cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. After overnight culture, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine PLUS™ according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each transfection assay was performed with 0.5 μg of the Dlx5 or Msx2 expression vector or pcDNA3 and 0.5 μg of the Runx2 promoter-luciferase reporter vector. All plasmid DNA was prepared using a DNA midi-prep kit. Three hours after transfection, the medium was changed, and the cells were cultured for the indicated periods. The cells were then harvested, and luciferase activity was determined with a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit. The results presented are representative data from at least three independent experiments with triplicate samples. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The oligonucleotide sequences of three putative homeodomain-binding sites between -342 and -756 bp from the transcription start site of the Runx2 P1 promoter were synthesized (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) (see Fig. 4D). The mutant D3 oligonucleotides were synthesized by substituting the ATTA sequence with the underlined sequences in Fig. 4D. These double-stranded DNA probes were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme. The Dlx5 and Msx2 proteins were produced by in vitro transcription and translation using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system. Nuclear extracts from C2C12 or Chinese hamster ovary cells that were transiently transfected with Dlx5 for 24 h were prepared as described previously (29Kim H.-J. Kim J.-H. Bae S.-C. Choi J.-Y.

Protein-DNA complexes were separated at 4 °C on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described in detail previously (30Shen J. Montecino M. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. J.

PCR primer pairs were generated to detect DNA segments located between nucleotides -715 and -431 of the mouse Runx2 distal promoter (nucleotide +1 is the mRNA cap site): forward, 5′-AACAGAAGGAAGCAGCCACC; and reverse, 5′-CCACACTCCTGTAAGGTTAAGC. Runx2-II Is Specifically Stimulated by BMP-2 and Dlx5—Our previous study showed that both BMP-2 and TGF-β1 stimulate Runx2 expression in C2C12 cells (12Lee M.-H. Javed A. Kim H.-J. Shin H.I. Gutierrez S. Choi J.-Y. Rosen V. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Ryoo H.-M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that BMP-2 treatment stimulated the expression of Runx2-II (5.4 kb) (Fig. 1A, arrow) and Runx2-I (6.0 kb) (arrowhead) transcripts, whereas TGF-β1 treatment stimulated mainly Runx2-I expression. Runx2-II expression was more strongly stimulated by BMP-2 treatment compared with Runx2-I expression. In addition, overexpression of Dlx5, which mediates Runx2 expression in response to BMP-2 signaling (14Lee M.-H. Kim Y.-J. Kim H.-J. Park H.-D. Kang A.-R. Kyung H.-M. Sung J.-H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.-J. Ryoo H.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34387-34394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), also specifically stimulated Runx2-II transcription (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). Moreover, in cells stably transfected with Dlx5-AS (14Lee M.-H. Kim Y.-J. Kim H.-J. Park H.-D. Kang A.-R. Kyung H.-M. Sung J.-H. Wozney J.M. Kim H.-J. Ryoo H.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34387-34394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), the antisense intervention of Dlx5 specifically blocked the BMP-2-stimulated expression of Runx2-II, but not Runx2-I (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-4). We previously demonstrated that these two Runx2 isoforms are differentially expressed during intramembranous bone formation in mouse cranial and axial bone development (10Park M.H. Shin H.I.

Kim H.-J. Ryoo H.-M. Exp. Mol. Med. 2002; 34: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As Runx2-II expression was specifically induced by BMP-2 treatment or by overexpression of its immediate downstream target gene Dlx5, we examined the expression of BMP-2, Dlx5, and Runx2 in the developing mouse calvaria. The pattern of Dlx5 expression matched those of BMP-2 and Runx2-II (Fig. 2, A-C). All three transcripts were strongly expressed in osteogenic fronts and parietal bones, but not in poorly differentiated sutural mesenchymal cells, whereas Runx2-I and Msx2 were strongly expressed in the latter cells (Fig. 2, E and F). Dlx5 Specifically Enhances Runx2 P1 Promoter Activity—Because expression of the two major isoforms of Runx2 is differentially regulated by two different promoters and because both BMP-2 treatment and Dlx5 overexpression are more closely associated with Runx2-II, the P1 promoter product, we analyzed the responsiveness of the Runx2 P1 and P2 promoters to Dlx5 overexpression. For this purpose, we prepared a series of 5′-deletion constructs as illustrated in Fig. 3A. The basal promoter activity of P1 promoter deletion constructs was notably stronger than that of P2 promoter deletion constructs (Fig. 3B). P1 promoter deletion analysis indicated a strong increase in reporter activity between P1-342 and P1-756 in both non-osteogenic (C2C12) and osteogenic (ROS17/2.8) cells. Interestingly, the stimulatory activity of Dlx5 disappeared for longer constructs in these cells (P1-1664 and P1-2782) (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, the stimulatory effect of Dlx5 was determined in P1-756 and was still observed for longer constructs (P1-1664 and P1-2782) in Runx2-/- cells (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results suggest that the Dlx5-response element in the P1 promoter is located between -756 and -342 bp from the Runx2-II transcription start site.

https://openalex.org/W2140442838,"Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were used as an experimental model to study the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF). ES-derived nestin-positive neural progenitor cells were exposed to extremely low frequency EMF simulating power line magnetic fields at 50 Hz (ELF-EMF) and to radiofrequency EMF simulating the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) signals at 1.71 GHz (RF-EMF). Following EMF exposure, cells were analyzed for transcript levels of cell cycle regulatory, apoptosis-related, and neural-specific genes and proteins; changes in proliferation; apoptosis; and cytogenetic effects. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that ELF-EMF exposure to ES-derived neural cells significantly affected transcript levels of the apoptosis-related bcl-2, bax, and cell cycle regulatory ""growth arrest DNA damage inducible"" GADD45 genes, whereas mRNA levels of neural-specific genes were not affected. RF-EMF exposure of neural progenitor cells resulted in down-regulation of neural-specific Nurr1 and in up-regulation of bax and GADD45 mRNA levels. Short-term RF-EMF exposure for 6 h, but not for 48 h, resulted in a low and transient increase of DNA double-strand breaks. No effects of ELF- and RF-EMF on mitochondrial function, nuclear apoptosis, cell proliferation, and chromosomal alterations were observed. We may conclude that EMF exposure of ES-derived neural progenitor cells transiently affects the transcript level of genes related to apoptosis and cell cycle control. However, these responses are not associated with detectable changes of cell physiology, suggesting compensatory mechanisms at the translational and posttranslational level."
https://openalex.org/W2075491707,"According to the classical view, the cytoprotective effect of inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) in oxidative stress was based on the prevention of NAD<sup>+</sup> and ATP depletion, thus the attenuation of necrosis. Our previous data on PARP inhibitors in an inflammatory model suggested that PARP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylations may affect signaling pathways, which can play a significant role in cell survival. To clarify the molecular mechanism of cytoprotection, PARP activity was inhibited pharmacologically by suppressing PARP-1 expression by a small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique or by transdominantly expressing the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of PARP-1 (PARP-DBD) in cultured cells. Cell survival, activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt system, and the preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential were studied in hydrogen peroxide-treated WRL-68 cells. Our data showed that suppression of the single-stranded DNA break-induced PARP-1 activation by pharmacological inhibitor, siRNA, or by the transdominant expression of PARP-DBD protected cells from oxidative stress and induced the phosphorylation and activation of Akt. Furthermore, prevention of Akt activation by inhibiting PI3-kinase counteracted the cytoprotective effect of PARP inhibition. Microscopy data showed that PARP inhibition-induced Akt activation was responsible for protection of mitochondria in oxidative stress because PI3-kinase inhibitors diminished the protective effect of PARP inhibition. Similarly, Src kinase inhibitors, which decrease Akt phosphorylation, also counteracted the protection of mitochondrial membrane potential supporting the pivotal role of Akt in cytoprotection. These data together with the finding that PARP inhibition in the absence of oxidative stress induced the phosphorylation and activation of Akt indicate that PARP inhibition-induced Akt activation is dominantly responsible for the cytoprotection in oxidative stress."

Their potency is due to their enzymatic activity and selective high affinity binding to neurons. Although there are many pieces of data available on the receptor for BoNT, little attempt has been made to characterize the receptors for BoNT/C and BoNT/D. For this purpose, we prepared the recombinant carboxyl-terminal domain of the heavy chain (H)C and then examined its binding capability to rat brain synaptosomes treated with enzymes and heating. Synaptosomes treated with proteinase K or heating retained binding capability to both HC/C and HC/D, suggesting that a proteinaceous substance does not constitute the receptor component. We next performed a thin layer chromatography overlay assay of HC with a lipid extract of synaptosomes. Under physiological or higher ionic strengths, HC/C bound to gangliosides GD1b and GT1b. These data are in accord with results showing that neuraminidase and endoglycoceramidase treatment decreased HC/C binding to synaptosomes. On the other hand, HC/D interacted with phosphatidylethanolamine but not with any ganglioside. Using cerebellar granule cells obtained from GM3 synthase knock-out mice, we found that BoNT/C did not elicit a toxic effect but that BoNT/D still inhibited glutamate release to the same extent as in granule cells from wild type mice. These observations suggested that BoNT/C recognized GD1b and GT1b as functional receptors, whereas BoNT/D induced toxicity in a ganglioside-independent manner, possibly through binding to phosphatidylethanolamine.

Seven types of Clostridium botulinum strains (A through G) are distinguished by differences in the antigenic specificity of their pharmacologically similar neurotoxins. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) 2The abbreviations used are: BoNTbotulinum neurotoxinBSAbovine serum albuminHBSHEPES-NaOH bufferH-chainheavy chainHCcarboxyl-terminal domain of the heavy chainHNamino-terminal domain of the heavy chainL-chainlight chainPEphosphatidylethanolamineTLCthin layer chromatographyVAMPvesicle-associated membrane protein. 2The abbreviations used are: BoNTbotulinum neurotoxinBSAbovine serum albuminHBSHEPES-NaOH bufferH-chainheavy chainHCcarboxyl-terminal domain of the heavy chainHNamino-terminal domain of the heavy chainL-chainlight chainPEphosphatidylethanolamineTLCthin layer chromatographyVAMPvesicle-associated membrane protein. are synthesized as single chain peptides with a molecular mass of ∼150 kDa that are proteolytically activated into a light chain (L-chain; 50 kDa) and a heavy chain (H-chain; 100 kDa) linked by a disulfide bond. It has been possible to assign some functional activities to certain domains of BoNT. The L-chain acts as a zinc-dependent endopeptidase and cleaves soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein families (1Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 2Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), whereupon the Ca2+-triggered fusion of a synaptic vesicle with the presynaptic membrane is disrupted. BoNT/B, BoNT/D, BoNT/F, and BoNT/G specifically cleave vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), a membrane protein of small synaptic vesicles, at different single peptide bonds. The other BoNTs attack specific proteins of the presynaptic membrane. BoNT/A and BoNT/E cleave the 25-kDa synaptosome-associated protein (SNAP-25) at two different sites located within the carboxyl terminus (1Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), whereas the specific target of BoNT/C is syntaxin. BoNT/C may also cleave the carboxyl terminus of SNAP-25 (3Foran P. Lawrence G.W. Shone C.C. Foster K.A. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2630-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The H-chain is composed of two remaining domains and serves as the vehicle that delivers the L-chain into the cytosol of neuronal cells. Therefore, the extreme toxicity has to be largely ascribed to the specific binding to nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction. The amino-terminal domain of the H-chain (HN) is responsible for translocating the L-chain from the lumen of an acidic intracellular compartment into the cytosol subsequent to cell binding and receptor-mediated endocytosis. The carboxyl-terminal domain of the H-chain (HC) exhibits highly selective binding for neurons, in particular for those of the cholinergic system (4Simpson L.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The receptor for BoNT has not been fully identified. Current evidence suggests that the receptors are composed of a certain specific ganglioside and of proteins that cooperate to form high affinity toxin-binding sites. Previously, we demonstrated the first time that BoNT/B binds specifically to synaptotagmins I and II in the presence of gangliosides GT1b and GD1a (5Nishiki T. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Omori A. Ito T.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Since then, reliable data that synaptotagmin is a functional receptor protein for BoNT/B have accumulated (9Dong M. Richards D.A. Goodnough M.C. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Furthermore, BoNT/G was found to interact with synaptotagmin in the absence of ganglioside (10Rummel A. Karnath T.

In contrast to human botulism mainly involving BoNT/A, BoNT/B, and BoNT/E, BoNT/C and BoNT/D are causative agents for animal and avian botulism (11Collins M.D. East A.K. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1998; 84: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Although BoNT/C and BoNT/D genes of several strains have been sequenced, these data appeared to be rather complicated. Some type C strains possess a unique BoNT gene structure that comprises two thirds of the BoNT/C gene and one third of the BoNT/D gene corresponding to the HC portion (12Moriishi K. Koura M. Abe N. Fujii N. Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Ogumad K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Moriishi K. Koura M. Fujii N. Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Syuto B. Oguma K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 662-667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we described how the gene for the mosaic form of BoNT is harbored in the isolates related to avian botulism, whereas the authentic BoNT/C may be implicated in the disease affecting mammalians, including cattle, mink, and horses (14Takeda M. Tsukamoto K. Kohda T. Matsui M. Mukamoto M. Kozaki S. Avian Dis. 2005; 49: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Several attempts to determine the susceptibility of birds to type C and D toxins revealed that birds showed resistance to type D toxin in comparison with type C toxin (15Gross W.B. Smith L.D. Avian Dis. 1971; 15: 716-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These findings let to us to question to what extent BoNT/C and BoNT/D share their own binding site on neural membranes, although they are immunologically related to each other (16Oguma K. Murayama S. Syuto B. Iida H. Kubo S. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 584-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Direct binding experiments indicated that BoNTs adhered to a certain ganglioside such as GT1b under a low ionic strength condition, but less binding in most BoNTs was observed under a physiological condition. BoNT/C appeared to bind exceptionally to gangliosides at both low and high ionic strengths (17Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Sakaguchi G. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 18Takamizawa K. Iwamori M. Kozaki S. Sakaguchi G. Tanaka R. Takayama H. Nagai Y. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Ochanda J.O. Syuto B. Ohishi I. Naiki M. Kubo S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Yowler B.C. Schengrund C.L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 9725-9731Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). BoNT/C caused paralysis in human neuromuscular preparation, but BoNT/D did not block the neuromuscular transmission (21Coffield J.A. Bakry N. Zhang R.D. Carlson J. Gomella L.G. Simpson L.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 1489-1498PubMed Google Scholar). From these observations, BoNT/C and BoNT/D appear to recognize different binding sites from each other. However, no attempt has been made to isolate and characterize the binding substances for BoNT/C and BoNT/D. In this study, we attempted to characterize the toxin binding substances for BoNT/C and BoNT/D with brain synaptosomes by treatment with various enzymes and to examine their toxic effect on cerebellar granule cells by using GM3 synthase knock-out mice. Eventually, BoNT/C and BoNT/D possess quite different characteristics in receptor recognition. Moreover, we provide informative results that BoNT/D elicits toxic action against neural cells in a ganglioside-independent manner. Purification of Neurotoxins—C. botulinum type C strains CB-19, 003-9, and type D strain 1873 were used for the purification of neurotoxins (BoNT/CB-19, BoNT/003-9, and BoNT/1873, respectively). BoNT/CB-19 was reported to produce a typical type C toxin, whereas BoNT/003-9 consists of a mosaic form of type C and D neurotoxins (C/D mosaic) (Fig. 1A). BoNTs were purified principally according to the method of Kurazono et al. (22Kurazono H. Shimozawa K. Hosokawa M. Sakaguchi G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1985; 30: 47-51Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Toxicity was assayed by the time-to-death method by intravenous injection into mice (23Kondo H. Shimizu T. Kubonoya M. Izumi N. Takahashi M. Sakaguchi G. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1984; 37: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Samples were also titrated by intraperitoneal injection into mice with serial 2-fold dilutions to obtain a mean 50% lethal dose (LD50) by the calculations of Reed and Muench (24Reed L.J. Muench H. Amer. J. Hyg. 1938; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructions and Recombinant Proteins—DNA fragments encoding the HC (HC/CB-19, amino acids 863–1291; HC/003-9, 863–1280; and HC/1873, 859–1276) of BoNTs were amplified with PCR using the primers 5′-CATGCCATGGCTGAATATTTCAATAATATTAATGATTCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTATTCACTTACAGGTACAAAACC-3′ (reverse) for HC/CB-19 and 5′-CATGCCATGGCTGAATATTTCAATAGTATTAATGATTCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTACTCTACCCATCCTGGATC-3′ (reverse) for HC/003-9 and HC/1873, where the NcoI and HindIII sites were included at the ends of the forward and reverse primers, respectively. These primers were designed based on the respective DNA sequences in GenBank™ (accession numbers AB200358 for BoNT/CB-19, AB200360 for BoNT/003-9, and AB012112 for BoNT/1873). After digestion with NcoI and HindIII, the PCR products were ligated into NcoI- and Hind-III-digested pET-30a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) and verified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Expression of recombinant HC was performed according to the pET system manual (Novagen). Cultures were grown at 37 °C in 100 ml of Luria-Bertani broth containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.5. After the addition of a 50 μm final concentration of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, growth was continued at 25 °C for an additional 24 h. The cells were collected and suspended in 4 ml B-PER® bacterial protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After treatment with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme for1hat4 °C, the cells were solubilized on ice by sonication and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subjected to purify His6-tagged HC with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic Superflow column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) as recommended by the instruction manual. The recombinant HC was further purified with an anion exchange column, Mono-Q HR 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences). Binding of Neurotoxins to Synaptosomes—The purified recombinant HC and BoNT were radioiodinated with Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by the chloramine-T method as described previously (25Kozaki S. Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1979; 308: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The specific activities of HCs and BoNTs were 13–17 mCi/mg protein (26.0–34.0 MBq/nmol). After iodination, the 125I-BoNTs retained >80% of that of unlabeled BoNTs. Synaptosomes were prepared from rat brain (26Whittaker V.P. Biochem. J. 1959; 72: 694-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and suspended in 3 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (HBS), pH 7.0, containing 120 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2. The binding of 125I-HC to synaptosomes was measured by filtration assay in the presence or absence of unlabeled HC or BoNT (27Ihara H. Kohda T. Morimoto F. Tsukamoto K. Karasawa T. Nakamura S. Mukamoto M. Kozaki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1625: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The concentration giving 50% inhibition (IC50) was calculated using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Enzyme Treatments—Synaptosomes were solubilized with HBS containing 15 mm n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside. Then, the solubilized synaptosomes (20 μg/ml protein) were treated at 37 °C for 30 min with 100 milliunits/ml endoglycoceramidase II (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), 100 milliunits/ml neuraminidase (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan), and 10 μg/ml proteinase K (Wako, Osaka, Japan) or boiled for 10 min. After treatment, the remaining toxin binding activity of the solubilized synaptosomes to 125I-HC was determined by filter-absorbance assay. In brief, the solubilized synaptosomes (100 μl) were applied to absorb on MultiScreen-HA plates (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) for 1 h at 37 °C. After filtration, the filters were blocked with HBS and 1% BSA. After washing three times with HBS and 0.5% BSA, 0.2 ml of 125I-HC (0.5 nm) in HBS plus 0.5% BSA was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, the filters were washed six times with 0.25 ml of chilled HBS and 0.5% BSA. The radioactivity retained on the filter membrane was measured using a γ-counter (GMI Inc., Ramsey, MN). TLC Overlay Assay—Lipids were extracted from lyophilized synaptosomes by the method described previously (28Iwamori M. Domino S.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 75-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lyophilized synaptosomes were incubated with chloroform/methanol/water (20:10:1, 10:20:1, and 1:1; v/v), the volume of combined extracts being adjusted with chloroform/methanol (1:1; v/v). Extracted lipids (corresponding to 20 μg of dry tissue weight), gangliosides (GM1a, GD1a, GT1a, GD2, GD3, GD1b, GT1b, GQ1b, and GT3; 0.5 nmol each), 3The ganglioside nomenclature proposed by Svennerholm was followed (see Ref. 51Svennerholm L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1980; 125: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). and phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol; 1 nmol each) were chromatographed on plastic-coated TLC plates (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) in chloroform/methanol/water (5:4:1) (v/v) for synaptosomal lipids and gangliosides or 65:25:4 (v/v) for phospholipids. The TLC plates were then dried and monitored for separation with resorcinol (for gangliosides) or molybdenum blue (for phospholipids). For the overlay assay, the replica plates were blocked with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) containing 1% polyvinylpyrrolidone at 4 °C for 12 h. After blocking, the plates were incubated with 1 nm 125I-HC for 2 h at room temperature. After washing three times in HBS to remove non-bound HC, the plates were dried in air and exposed to an imaging plate (BAS-MS2340, Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). The HC binding lipids were detected with a FLA-3000 system (Fuji Photo Film). Preparation of Cerebellar Granule Neurons—Following the decapitation of 6–9-day-old C57/BL6J mice, the cerebella were removed and transferred immediately into ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 5.6 mm glucose. After eliminating the meninges, the tissues were cut into 1-mm pieces and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% (w/v) trypsin, 28 mm glucose, and 0.05% DNase for 20 min at 37 °C, with occasional agitation. After the removal of trypsin by brief centrifugation, the tissue was mechanically dissociated by repeated pipetting in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.25% glucose, 12 mm MgSO4, and 0.01% DNase. After filtering through a Falcon cell strainer (BD Labware), the cell suspension was collected by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in minimal essential medium containing 25 mm K+ (HK-MEM) with 5% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum. The cells were plated on polyethylenimine-coated four-well culture dishes (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) at a density of 4.5 × 105 cells/cm2 and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Between 2 and 4 days the medium was replaced with HK-MEM and 2% B-27 supplement (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 μm cytosine arabinofuranoside to inhibit the replication of non-neuronal cells, and, thereafter, no further medium change was carried out before the experiment. Exposure to BoNT and Assay of Glutamate Release—In the experiments to examine the effects of BoNT on glutamate release various concentrations of BoNT (4 μl) were added to cultures (400 μl) at 7 days and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. BoNT-treated cerebellar cells were washed with pre-warmed low K+ solution (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 128 mm NaCl, 1.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 10 mm glucose), and the extracellular solution was changed every 2 min. After changing the low K+ solution three times, the K+ concentration was elevated from 5 to 50 mm to depolarize the cells (29Koga T. Kozaki S. Takahashi M. Brain Res. 2002; 952: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The glutamate content of the extracellular solution was determined by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Mightysil RP-18 GP 150-4.6 column (Kanto Kagaku, Tokyo, Japan) using precolumn derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde and fluorescence detection (FP-2020 Plus, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoblotting Detection of BoNT-cleaved Intracellular Substrates—BoNT-treated cerebellar granule cells were collected and solubilized with SDS sample buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 4% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide gels) and immunoblotting. The antibodies against syntaxin or VAMP-2 were obtained according to a method described elsewhere (5Nishiki T. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Omori A. Ito T. Takahashi M. Kozaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10498-10503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kohda T. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. J. Vet. Med. Sci. 2000; 62: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and then treated with 10 μg/ml rabbit anti-VAMP-2 antibody and mouse anti-syntaxin monoclonal antibody followed by 5 μg/ml goat anti-rabbit (or mouse) IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad). The reactive bands were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate solution (Promega, Madison, WI). Others—Purified gangliosides (GM1a, GD1a, GT1a, GD2, GD3, GD1b, GT1b, GQ1b, and GT3) were kindly provided by Masao Iwamori, Faculty of Science and Technology, Kinki University. The amount of gangliosides was defined as the amount of N-acetylneuraminic acid determined using the method of Aminoff (30Aminoff D. Virology. 1959; 7: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All phospholipids were purchased from Avanti polar lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). SDS-PAGE was performed in a 10 or 12.5% gel by the method of Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of either Bradford (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) or Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a bovine γ-globulin or BSA as a standard, respectively. C57BL/6J and ddY mice were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). GM3 synthase knock-out mice were generated from C57BL/6J mice according to a previously reported method (35Aizawa S. Suda Y. Furuta Y. Yagi T. Takeda N. Watanabe N. Nagayoshi M. Ikawa Y. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The neomycin resistance gene was inserted in the position of the second exon of the seven-exon GM3 synthase gene. The mutant mice were unable to synthesize GM3 ganglioside, a simple and widely distributed glycosphingolipid. The mutant mice were viable and appeared without major abnormalities. Other detailed characteristics of the mutant mice will be reported elsewhere. Binding of Recombinant HC to Rat Brain Synaptosomes—The recombinant proteins (HC/CB-19, HC/003-9, and HC/1873) were successfully obtained in a pure state (Fig. 1B). In the binding experiments we conducted an examination of the binding capability of 125I-HC in the presence of unlabeled homologous and heterologous HC or BoNT (Fig. 2). The binding of 125I-HC/CB-19 was effectively inhibited in the presence of homologous HC and the presence of BoNT/CB-19 to the same extent, whereas HC/003-9 and HC/1873 had little inhibitory effect on the binding. The binding of 125I-HC/003-9 and HC/1873 were completely out-competed by both unlabeled HC/003-9 and HC/1873, but not by HC/CB-19. These data indicate that the recognition site of HC/003-9 and HC/1873 is the same, whereas that of HC/CB-19 is different. When compared with the IC50 of the BoNTs, 003-9/BoNT appeared to possess a binding capability higher than that of BoNT/1873. BoNT/CB-19 showed a binding activity lower than did BoNT/003-9 and HC/1873. To examine the properties of their HC binding substances, we conducted some experiments with enzyme- and heat-treated synaptosomes for the binding of recombinant HC (Fig. 3). In HC/CB-19, a drastic decrease of the binding was observed in enzyme treatments with endoglycoceramidase II and neuraminidase, whereas neither proteinase K nor heat treatment affected the binding. These results may suggest that BoNT/CB-19 requires a sialic acid moiety in binding to synaptosomes, but not a proteinaceous substance. In type D binding with HC/003-9 and HC/1873, there was no significant decrease in their binding after any treatment. These observations indicate that the receptors for BoNT/C and HC/D possess characteristics different from those for type A and B, because their toxin binding to brain synaptosomes was inhibited by treatment with neuraminidase (36Kitamura M. Sone S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 143: 928-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 37Ogasawara J. Kamata Y. Sakaguchi G. Kozaki S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 63: 351-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and boiling (data not shown). It is probable that the binding substance for BoNT/D does not involve a sialic acid moiety.FIGURE 3Effect of enzyme and heat treatments on the binding of recombinant HC to rat brain synaptosomes. Synaptosomes were solubilized with HBS containing 15 mm n-octyl-β-d-thioglucoside. Then, solubilized synaptosome (20 μg protein/ml) was treated with endoglycoceramidase II (EGCase II) (100 milliunits/ml), neuraminidase (100 milliunits/ml), or proteinase K (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C or boiled for 10 min. After treatment, the remaining binding activity was determined by a filter absorbance assay (see “Experimental Procedure”). The binding of HC/CB-19 was decreased by the treatment with endoglycoceramidase II and neuraminidase, whereas the binding of HC/003-9 and/1873 was not affected by any treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of Recombinant HC to Gangliosides and Phospholipids—In the preliminary experiments, we found that BoNT/C and BoNT/D could bind to lipids. There is little available data on the interaction of BoNT/C and BoNT/D with gangliosides and phospholipids. In the binding experiments with lipids, we performed a TLC overlay assay in the presence of 0.3 m NaCl because a nonspecific reaction was observed in the presence of 0.15 m NaCl or low concentrations. HC/CB-19 bound to gangliosides GD1b and GT1b but not to other gangliosides or to any phospholipids. On the other hand, HC/003-9 and HC/1873 recognized PE, but not other phospholipids or any gangliosides (Fig. 4A). Analysis of brain gangliosides in the GM3 synthase knock-out mice demonstrated a pattern consistent with an absence of GM3 synthase (Fig. 4B, two left sections). The major brain gangliosides present in wild type mice (GM1a, GD1b, and GT1b) were absent in the knock-out mice. However, the GM3 synthase knock-out mice expressed major ganglioside species that comigrated with GM1b and GD1α gangliosides of the α-series, which do not require the activity of GM3 synthase (38Yamashita T. Hashiramoto A. Haluzik M. Mizukami H. Beck S. Norton A. Kono M. Tsuji S. Daniotti J.L. Werth N. Sandhoff R. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3445-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We then performed similar experiments using lipid extracts from mouse brain to confirm the HC binding to lipids. As shown in Fig. 4B, three right sections, HC/CB-19 bound to two kinds of lipids showing different migration distances on TLC. The migration positions of these lipids corresponded to those of GD1b and GT1b, respectively. HC/003-9 and HC/1873 bound only to a lipid whose migration position in TLC was identical to that of PE. In addition, to elucidate the binding property of HC/003-9 to PE, we determined the degree of binding to saturated fatty acid with different chain lengths of 12 to 20 carbons and found that diphytanoyl PE showed the strongest affinity with HC/003-9 (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Binding specificity of HC/003-9 to PE.

We have found that isolated human mitochondrial ClpP (hClpP) is stable as a heptamer and remains a monodisperse species (s20,w 7.0 S; Mapp 169, 200) at concentrations ≥3 mg/ml. Heptameric hClpP has no proteolytic activity and very low peptidase activity. In the presence of ATP, hClpX interacts with hClpP forming a complex, which by equilibrium sedimentation measurements has a Mapp of 1 × 106. Electron microscopy confirmed that the complex consisted of a double ring of hClpP with an hClpX ring axially aligned on each end. The hClpXP complex has protease activity and greatly increased peptidase activity, indicating that interaction with hClpX affects the conformation of the hClpP catalytic active site. A mutant of hClpP, in which a cysteine residue was introduced into the handle region at the interface between the two rings formed stable tetradecamers under oxidizing conditions but spontaneously dissociated into two heptamers upon reduction. Thus, hClpP rings interact transiently but very weakly in solution, and hClpX must exert an allosteric effect on hClpP to promote a conformation that stabilizes the tetradecamer. These data suggest that hClpX can regulate the appearance of hClpP peptidase activity in mitochondria and might affect the nature of the degradation products released during ATP-dependent proteolytic cycles.

ClpXP is an ATP-dependent protease that catalyzes unfolding and degradation of misfolded proteins as well as specifically tagged native and non-native proteins (1Maurizi M.R. Xia D.

Both components, ClpX and ClpP, are highly conserved and are found in all eubacteria and within mitochondria or chloroplasts of higher eukaryotes (3Adam Z. Clarke A.K.

In bacterial cells, ClpXP performs essential functions as a global regulator by targeting short lived regulatory proteins for degradation (2Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 565-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and is an important component of protein quality control systems (6Gottesman S. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The human homologs, hClpX and hClpP, are imported into mitochondria, but little is known regarding their specific biological functions (7Bross P. Andresen B.S. Knudsen I. Kruse T.A. Gregersen N.

Bross P. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In vitro, hClpXP has a structure and enzymatic properties similar to the Escherichia coli enzyme, although it displays an altered specificity toward protein substrates (5Kang S.G. Ortega J.

Active complexes of ClpXP consist of the Clp/Hsp100 chaperone (10Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), ClpX, and the compartmentalized protease, ClpP (11Grimaud R. Kessel M. Beuron F. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12476-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In many organisms, ClpP also associates with another chaperones, ClpA. Both ClpX and ClpA are members of the AAA+ protein superfamily (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) (12Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AAA proteins are a functionally diverse group of unfoldases that catalyze restructuring and translocation of macromolecules (12Neuwald A.F.

ClpX and ClpA from E. coli function autonomously as chaperones, catalyzing protein unfolding (14Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2399-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). ClpX and ClpA have binding sites for specific peptide motifs (19Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A.

Cell. 2003; 11: 671-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), allowing them to target different proteins for degradation by ClpP. Additionally, small adaptor proteins associate with the complexes to facilitate interaction with specific substrates (21Schweder T. Lee K.H. Lomovskaya O. Matin A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 22Becker G. Klauck E. Hengge-Aronis R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The functional form of ClpP is a tetradecamer assembled from two 7-fold symmetric rings stacked face-to-face to form a stable double ringed structure (25Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 26Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The rings enclose a large aqueous chamber with the 14 proteolytic active sites inside, sealed off from the surrounding solution except for narrow axial channels through each ring (25Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 27Kang S.G. Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Mueser T. Ahvazi B. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). ClpX is a hexameric ring with 6-fold symmetry. ATP binding stabilizes the ClpX rings and the holoenzyme complex; the latter is formed by co-axial stacking of the ClpX hexamers on one or both ends of ClpP (5Kang S.G. Ortega J. Singh S.K. Wang N. Huang N.N. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21095-21102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 11Grimaud R. Kessel M. Beuron F. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12476-12481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). During a catalytic cycle, ClpX binds a protein substrate, unfolds it, and translocates it through the narrow axial channels into ClpP. On its own, ClpP has limited peptidase activity, and this activity can be stimulated >100-fold in the presence of ClpX or ClpA (kcat > 10,000 min-1/tetradecamer of eClpP) (28Thompson M.W. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18201-18208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptidase activity does not require ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that ClpA and ClpX exert an allosteric effect on the conformation of ClpP, either improving peptide access to the active sites or enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the active sites. Without ATP hydrolysis, only relatively short peptides <15 residues long are degraded rapidly by ClpXP; longer peptides and proteins are degraded very slowly or not at all. The restriction of proteolytic activity has been thought to reflect the restricted access of larger polypeptides to the active site chamber of ClpP. The current paradigm with respect to ClpP and other proteasome-like proteases is that sequestration of the active sites is required to protect cellular proteins from unwanted proteolytic damage (29Lupas A. Flanagan J.M. Tamura T. Baumeister W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 399-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that purified hClpP occurs as a stable heptamer in solution, in contrast to E. coli ClpP, which is predominantly a stable tetradecamer (30Maurizi M.R. Singh S.K. Thompson M.W. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7778-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Binding of ClpX promotes interaction between the two hClpP rings. The occurrence of stable free heptameric forms of ClpP suggests that allosteric control of the catalytically active conformation of ClpP is required to avoid untimely or inappropriate degradation of cellular proteins. Protein Expression and Purification—Native hClpP, hClpP-ΔC, in which the C-terminal domain was deleted, and hClpX proteins were purified as described (5Kang S.G. Ortega J. Singh S.K. Wang N. Huang N.N. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21095-21102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). C-terminally His-tagged hClpP and mutants of hClpP were cloned and purified as described (27Kang S.G. Maurizi M.R. Thompson M.W. Mueser T. Ahvazi B. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 338-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against hClpP were raised in rabbits inoculated with purified recombinant hClpP mixed with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Green fluorescent protein carrying a C-terminal degradation tag (GFP 4The abbreviations used are: GFPgreen fluorescent proteinDTTdithiothreitolATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)bis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. -SsrA) was prepared as described (15Singh S.K. Grimaud R. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8898-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Sequence of SsrA is AANDENYALAA. green fluorescent protein dithiothreitol adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. Mutagenesis and Preparation of Mutant Proteins—The hClpP gene cloned behind the T7 promoter in pVEX11 (Clontech) was used for mutagenesis by the overlapping PCR procedure (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Mutant clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To obtain hClpP-h125_131e, in which residues 125-131 of hClpP were changed to the corresponding ones in eClpP, the PCR primer sequences used were, for the top, 5′-CAgCCCTTgggAggCTACCAgggCCAAgCCACAgACATTgCCATCCAggCAgAg and, for the bottom, 5′-TgTggCTTggCCCTggTAgCCTCCCAAgggCTggTggATCATgATACgggAg. The external PCR primers used to amplify the construct were, for the top, 5′-CgACCCggCATATgCCgCTCATTCCCATCgTggTggAg and, for the bottom, 5′-CCTCCACATAAgCTTTCAgTgATggTgATggTgATgggTgCTAgCTgggACAggTTCTgCTgC. An NdeI site and a HindIII site in the primers allowed the PCR product to be cloned into NdeI/HindIII-digested pVEX11. Enzymatic Assays—ATP-dependent protein degradation assays using α-casein or phage λ O protein as a substrate were described previously (5Kang S.G. Ortega J. Singh S.K. Wang N. Huang N.N. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21095-21102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Peptidase activity was measured using Cleptide (FAPH-MALVPV) as described previously (5Kang S.G. Ortega J. Singh S.K. Wang N. Huang N.N. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21095-21102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Thompson M.W. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18201-18208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation of GFP-SsrA was monitored by decreased fluorescence in reaction mixtures containing 0.5-1.0 μm GFP-SsrA, 0.5 μm eClpX, and 0.5 μm hClpP or mutant hClpP in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 0.02% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP (15Singh S.K. Grimaud R. Hoskins J.R. Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8898-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Fluorescence of GFP-SsrA was measured at constant temperature with an Amino-Bowman spectrofluorometer (series 2) with excitation at 395 nm (4-nm bandwidth) and emission at 509 nm (4-8-nm bandwidth). Prewarmed solutions were transferred to a microcuvette (12-25 μl) and readings were started within 15-20 s of addition of the initiating reagent, usually eClpX. Gel Filtration—Assembly of hClpXP complexes was monitored by size exclusion chromatography on a 0.32 × 30-cm Superdex200 (Pharmacia) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATPγS. DTT was present at 1 mm when indicated. For detection of hClpP in mitochondrial extracts, aliquots of the gel filtration fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and hClpP was detected by Western blotting using anti-hClpP antiserum. Protein profiles were obtained by monitoring absorbance at 280 or 290 nm, and the identities confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Complex formation was also monitored by ultrafiltration using UFC300-MC membranes (Millipore Corporation). Proteins (hClpX and hClpP) were added to the same buffer used for gel filtration in a final volume of 50 μl, 10 μl was taken for reference, and 40 μl was loaded into the cartridge, which was centrifuged at 1000 × g to allow ∼30 μl to pass through. Aliquots of the different fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, the proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue, and the amounts hClpX and hClpP were quantitated by densitometry. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Proteins were equilibrated for ultracentrifugation by gel filtration in the desired buffers or by overnight dialysis against the buffer. Optima Models XL-A and XL-I analytical ultracentrifuges (Beckman, Inc.) equipped with four-place An-Ti rotors were used for sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments. The densities (ρ) of buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm KCl, pH 7.5), buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5), and buffer C (50 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm ATPγS, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.5) were determined to be 1.0101, 1.0074, and 1.038 g/ml, respectively, at 20.00 ± 0.01 °C, using an Anton Paar Model DMA-58 densitometer. Corresponding values of relative viscosity were determined to be 1.015, 1.017, and 1.415 using an in-house viscometer (32Shapiro B.M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 2153-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Partial specific volumes of 0.726 ml/g for hClpP and 0.722 ml/g for the hClpXP complex were calculated from the sum of the contributions of the amino acid residues (33Zamyatnin A.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1984; 13: 145-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Absorbance coefficients at 280 nm for hClpP (0.673 cm2/mg) and hClpX (0.365 cm2/mg) were calculated from their Trp, Tyr, and Cys contents (34Perkins S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). For interference optics, the calibration value of 3.191 ± 0.005 fringes (mg/ml)-1 (35Nosworthy N.J. Peterkofsky A. König S. Seok Y.-J. Szczepanowski R.H. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6718-6726Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was corroborated with a solution of 3.428 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin. For time derivative analysis (36Stafford W.F. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the procedures of Zolkiewski et al. (37Zolkiewski M. Redowicz M.J. Korn E.D. Hammer J.A. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7876-7883Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were used. Observed sedimentation coefficients (sobs) were corrected to the density and viscosity of water at 20 °C, where s20,w = 1.0574 × sobs for hClpP and s20,w = 1.0463 × sobs for eClpP (reported in Svedberg units, S). Frictional coefficient ratios (f/f0) (where f0 is the frictional coefficient of a sphere having the volume equal to that of an ellipsoid) were calculated from the values for Mr, partial specific volume, and s20,w (38Schachman H.K. Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1959: 116-128Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments with hClpP were performed at 4.0 °C. Two 12-mm cells equipped with plane quartz windows and double sector centerpieces were loaded with 0.110 μl of hClpP or hClpP-ΔC in buffer A (with 280 nm absorbance of 0.20); a third cell contained hClpP (with 280 nm absorbance of 0.11). The reference channel of each cell was filled with 0.125 ml of buffer A. When the rotor speed reached 3000 rpm, scans at 280 nm were made to establish the positions of the menisci and the cell bottoms, and the rotor was then accelerated to 5300 rpm. After 24 h, programmed autoscans (9-11 averages, 0.001 cm steps in step-mode) were initiated and made at 2-h intervals. After reaching sedimentation equilibrium (48-56 h) the rotor speed was changed to 11,000 rpm for another 56 h to deplete the meniscus, and scans were recorded as above. Sedimentation equilibrium of hClpXP complexes was performed at 12 °C. A mixture containing hexameric ClpX and heptameric ClpP in a 1.1:1.0 molar ratio was dialyzed against buffer C, and 0.12 ml (2.9 mg/ml total protein) was loaded into the right channel of a double sector cell (1.2-cm path length) equipped with sapphire windows and a carbon-filled epoxy centerpiece. Dialysate (0.12 ml) was placed in the left reference channel. The rotor was accelerated to 3000 rpm until optical calibrations and initial scans were performed and then maintained at 3500 rpm for the duration of the run. When interference optics was used, scans were made at 2-h intervals until five consecutive scans overlapped. Because the fringe displacement just inside the meniscus must be set to zero at the start of each run, the value of the fringe displacement at the meniscus was added to the final protein concentration gradient after subtraction of the buffer baseline. To obtain a buffer baseline, the protein was removed from the assembled cell at the end of a run, and the right channel was flushed repeatedly before reloading with dialysate; a scan was recorded after the cell came to equilibrium at 3500 rpm and 12 °C. Simulations and reiterative fits of the data took into account the competent loading concentration and the buoyant density of the 2:1 complex. The goodness of the fits were judged on the basis of a random distribution of residuals around zero with either ± 0.01 absorbance or ± 0.003-0.005 fringe displacement. Data analysis was performed with the software provided by Allen P. Minton (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). Chemical Modification and Limited Proteolysis—Histidine residues in hClpP were chemically modified by incubating 2 mg hClpP with 0.1 mm carbobenzoxy-Leu-Tyr-chloromethyl ketone in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol at 37 °C for up to 2 h. Samples were withdrawn for assay, and at the end the entire mixture was treated with 1.5 volumes of cold acetone to precipitate the protein, which was then dissolved in 70% formic acid to which 20 mm CNBr had been added. After incubation overnight at 0 °C, the solution was lyophilized, and the cleavage products were dissolved in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were isolated by revere phase chromatography using the column and system mentioned above. Control samples, not treated with carbobenzoxy-Leu-Tyr-chloromethyl ketone, were digested and analyzed in parallel. Samples from the reverse phase column as well as aliquots of the original mixture of digestion products were analyzed using a Micromass TofSpec-2E mass spectrometer. Chemical cross-linking of subunits was performed by incubating 4 μg of hClpP with 0.1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol at room temperature for 30 min. Aliquots of 5 μl were withdrawn and immediately added to 5 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer sitting in a boiling water bath. The entire sample was loaded in each lane, and proteins were separated on a 12% bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and stained with Coomassie Blue. For limited proteolysis, 10 μg of ClpP was incubated in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Aliquots were withdrawn, quenched by adding to an equal volume of hot 2× SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed, and detected by staining, as described above. Electron Microscopy and Image Processing—Electron micrographs of negatively stained complexes were obtained as described previously (39Ortega J. Lee H.S. Maurizi M.R. Steven A.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4938-4949Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Micrographs were digitized at 1.55 Å/pixel, using a SCAI scanner (Z/I Imaging, Huntsville, AL). The numbers of complexes with one or two ClpX associated with ClpP were recorded after visual examination of the micrographs. The number of ambiguous particles, not identifiable as ClpXP complexes, was <5% of the total. Preparation of Rat Liver Mitochondria—Frozen rat livers were obtained from Pel-freeze. Livers (20 g) were thawed by suspension in breaking buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm sucrose, 25 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 and then minced. Liver pieces were washed three times by allowing them to settle and decanting excess buffer. Washed pieces were homogenized using an ice-chilled Teflon-glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was removed to a separate tube with a pipette. The pellet was suspended in 40 ml of breaking buffer, and the above step was repeated. The two supernatant fractions were combined and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet containing the mitochondria was suspended in buffer, after using paper towels to remove excess lipid from the wall of the tube. Additional washing was performed 2-3 times by suspending the pellet in 20 ml of breaking buffer and repeating the centrifugation as above. The final washed pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Suspensions were stored at -70 °C. To break the mitochondria, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 0.3%, and the solution was left on ice for 2 h. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 1 h. Recombinant hClpP Is a Heptamer in Solution— hClpP (subunit Mr 24,000) displays unusual behavior upon gel filtration. On a Superdex200 column (Fig. 1A), ClpP migrated in approximately the same position as eClpP, which is known to be a tetradecamer, initially leading us to conclude that hClpP is also tetradecameric in solution. However, a mutant of hClpP (hClpP-ΔC; subunit Mr 21,000), which lacks the 28-amino acid C-terminal domain, migrated much more slowly during gel filtration and eluted in the position expected for a heptamer (Fig. 1A). This difference in behavior was unexpected because both proteins displayed similar peptidase activity as well as ClpX-mediated protease activity. Light scattering data confirmed a difference in the hydrodynamic radius between the wild type and mutant proteins (data not shown). To determine the basis for of the differences in gel filtration behavior, we performed sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation. A time-derivative analysis of the hClpP gradient after ∼96 min at 40,000 rpm is shown in Fig. 2. A similar analysis of sedimentation data previously obtained with eClpP (30Maurizi M.R. Singh S.K. Thompson M.W. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7778-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) indicates that, under similar conditions, eClpP sediments much faster than hClpP (Fig. 2). The hClpP data can be fit by a single Gaussian, indicative of a monodisperse, non-interacting solute with an s20,w of 7.0 S and a D20,w of 3.65 × 10-7 cm2 s-1. From the Svedberg equation, these values provide a calculated Mr of 169,800 (TABLE ONE), corresponding to a heptamer of hClpP (subunit Mr 24,166). The frictional coefficient ratio (f/f0) for hClpP obtained from the Mr, the partial specific volume, and the s20,w was 1.6, indicating an asymmetric shape and a large hydrodynamic radius, consistent with its unusual high mobility during gel filtration. In contrast, eClpP has an s20,w of 12.2 S, Mr of 302,000, and a calculated f/f0 value of 1.2 (30Maurizi M.R. Singh S.K. Thompson M.W. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7778-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), consistent with a symmetrical tetradecameric species. Corrected sedimentation coefficients for hClpP obtained at 20 °C were the same in the absence and presence of 10% glycerol (data not shown).TABLE ONESummary of hydrodynamic values at pH 7.5 For conditions and analysis see “Experimental Procedures.”Clp proteins20,w × 1013 (±0.2 S)D20,w × 107 (±0.1 cm2/s)f/f0Mr (s/D)aFrom s/D and the Svedberg equation; determined at 20 °C (±5%)Mr (SedEq) (±3%)hClpP (wild type)7.03.651.6169,800 (20 °C)169,200 (4 °C)hClpPΔC8.2–bThe hClpP-ΔC mutant exhibited an instability after centrifugation for long times at 20 °C by excessive boundary spreading1.2150,000 (4 °C)eClpPcFrom Ref. 3012.23.61.2300,000 (20 °C)–hClpX6P14X631–1.31,000,000dThe Mrvalue was determined from the d log(c)/d (r2) plot using interference optics (Fig. 7B).

https://openalex.org/W2016669482,"The superoxide-producing phagocyte NADPH oxidase consists of a membrane-bound flavocytochrome b558, the cytosol factors p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase Rac2, which translocate to the membrane to assemble the active complex following neutrophil activation. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) does not activate NADPH oxidase, but potentiates the oxidative burst induced by stimuli such as formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) via a priming mechanism. The effect of IL-8 on the components of NADPH oxidase during the priming process has never been investigated in human neutrophils. Here we showed that within 3 min, IL-8 treatment enhanced the Btk- and ERK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of p47phox, as well as the recruitment of flavocytochrome b558, p47phox, and Rac2 into cholesterol-enriched detergent-resistant microdomains (or lipid rafts). Conversely, IL-8 treatment lasting 15 min failed to recruit flavocytochrome b558, p47phox, or Rac2, but did enhance the Btk- and p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation and the translocation of p67phox into detergent-resistant microdomains. Moreover, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which disrupts lipid rafts, inhibited IL-8-induced priming in response to fMLP. Our findings indicate that IL-8-induced priming of the oxidative burst in response to fMLP involves a sequential assembly of the NADPH oxidase components in the lipid rafts of neutrophils.

Neutrophils are key components of the early innate response against microbial pathogens. Their activation triggers microbiocidal mechanisms, including the rapid production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; fMLP, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IL, interleukin; DRM, detergent-resistant microdomain; MβCB, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; PKB, protein kinase B; PKC, protein kinase C; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BisTris, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; fMLP, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IL, interleukin; DRM, detergent-resistant microdomain; MβCB, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; PKB, protein kinase B; PKC, protein kinase C; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; BisTris, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. known as the oxidative burst, that play a key role in bacterial killing. However, in an excessive and/or inappropriate response, ROS can induce vascular and tissue lesions. Generation of ROS by neutrophils results from the activation of NADPH oxidase, a multicomponent enzyme system that catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of oxygen to the superoxide anion (O2⋅¯), which is the precursor of the other ROS. In resting cells, this multicomponent enzyme system is inactive, and its components are dispersed between the cytosol and the membranes. The flavocytochrome b558 component, which is composed of two subunits, gp91phox and p22phox, is located in the plasma membrane and in specific granules. The other components of the NADPH complex (p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and small G protein Rac2) are cytosol proteins. The activation of neutrophils by various stimuli, such as bacterial N-formyl peptides (fMLP) and phorbol myristate acetate, triggers the phosphorylation of the p47phox, p67phox, and p40phox cytosolic components and their translocation to the plasma membrane, where they interact with flavocytochrome b558 (1Ago T.

Concomitantly, Rac2 is dissociated from its inhibitor, RhoGDP dissociation inhibitors, and then interacts with flavocytochrome b558 to form a binding partner for p67phox (5Bokoch G.M. Diebold B.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 2692-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The. complete assembly of NADPH oxidase components is crucial for O2⋅¯ production (6Babior B.M. Curr. Opin.

The activation of NADPH oxidase is tightly regulated at infectious and inflammatory sites to avoid tissue and vascular lesions. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor α, are known to modulate NADPH oxidase activity by means of a priming phenomenon that strengthens the bactericidal capacity of the neutrophils (8Yuo A.

These cytokines do not stimulate oxidative burst activity on their own, but strongly enhance ROS production in response to exposure to a secondary applied stimulus, such as fMLP. Partial p47phox phosphorylation has been shown to be induced by tumor necrosis factor α (13Dewas C. Dang P.M. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. El Benna J. J.

Other priming mechanisms have also been described previously, including increased membrane expression of flavocytochrome b558 (15DeLeo F.R. Renee J. McCormick S. Nakamura M. Apicella M. Weiss J.P.

Several mechanisms have been reported to be involved in the priming effect of IL-8. They include increased expression and cycling of fMLP receptors (fMLP-R) (20Metzner B. Barbisch M. Parlow F. Kownatzki E. Schraufstatter I. Norgauer J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), increased intracellular-free Ca2+ (21Wozniak A. Betts W.H. Murphy G.A. Rokicinski M. Immunology. 1993; 79: 608-615PubMed Google Scholar), and increased phospholipase A2 activation (22Daniels R.H. Finnen M.J. Hill M.E. Lackie J.M. Immunology. 1992; 75: 157-163PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effects of IL-8 on the transductional pathways that determine the kinetics and assembly of the various components of the NADPH oxidase complex, and which could contribute to the IL-8-induced priming of the oxidative burst, have yet to be investigated. It has recently been shown that cholesterol-enriched detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (DRMs), or lipid rafts, play a key role in the fMLP-, phorbol myristate acetate-, and Fcγ-dependent receptor activation of NADPH oxidase by triggering the recruitment and/or spatial orientation of cytosolic phox proteins relative to flavocytochrome b558 (23Vilhardt F. Van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Shao D. Segal A.W. Dekker L.V. FEBS Lett. 2003; 550: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The involvement of lipid rafts in regulating neutrophil functions is suggested by the fact that the neutrophil oxidative burst can be severely curtailed by depleting the level of cholesterol in the plasma membranes using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (23Vilhardt F. Van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 25Katsumata O. Hara-Yokoyama M. Sautes-Fridman C. Nagatsuka Y. Katada T. Hirabayashi Y. Shimizu K. Fujita-Yoshigaki J. Sugiya H. Furuyama S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5814-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether lipid raft microdomains play a regulatory role in the IL-8-induced priming of the oxidative burst in human neutrophils. In this study, we analyzed the effects of IL-8, alone and when combined with fMLP, on the phosphorylation and/or translocation of p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2, the segregation of flavocytochrome b558 into DRMs, and the transduction pathways involved in these processes. The main findings of this study reveal that IL-8 induced in a sequential manner the phosphorylation of cytosol phox components and the recruitment of the NADPH oxidase components (including flavocytochrome b558) into lipid rafts, suggesting that this pre-assembly could play at least some part in the priming effect of IL-8 on the neutrophil oxidative burst triggered in response to N-formyl peptides. Reagents—Human recombinant interleukin-8 (rhIL-8), rabbit polyclonal anti-p22phox (FL-195), anti-ERK1 (C-16), and anti-ERK2 (K-23) were from Tebu-Bio (Le Perray en Yvelines, France).

Babior, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) was raised against the 10 COOH-terminal residues of p47phox and purified, as previously described (26Park J.W. Benna J.E. Scott K.E.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the COOH-terminal sequence of p67phox were prepared as previously described (28Benna J.E. Dang P.M. Gaudry M. Fay M. Morel F. Hakim J. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. J.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and Hyperfilm™ were from Amersham Biosciences. ECL reagents were from Perbio (Brebières, France). Neutrophil Preparation—Human neutrophils were obtained in lipopolysaccharide-free conditions by means of dextran sedimentation and Ficoll centrifugation as previously described (13Dewas C. Dang P.M. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. El Benna J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4392-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Superoxide Anion Production Assay—Superoxide anion (O2⋅¯) production was continuously recorded for 5 min by monitoring the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c, using an UVIKON 860 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted (37 °C) cuvette holder, as previously described (29Amar M. Amit N. Huu T.P. Chollet-Martin S. Labro M.T. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Hakim J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4749-4756PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide production by 106 cells suspended in 1 ml of HBSS was triggered by adding the stimulus (fMLP 10−7 m). In addition, the priming effect of IL-8 on O2⋅¯ production in response to fMLP was tested by pre-treating neutrophils (106 cells) at 37 °C with IL-8 at various concentrations (0.01-50 ng/ml) and for various incubation times (1-60 min). O2⋅¯ production in response to fMLP (10−7 m) was then measured for 5 min. In some experiments, samples were preincubated with MβCD (0.2 mg/ml, 30 min) before IL-8 and fMLP stimulation. 32P Labeling, Stimulation, and Fractionation of Neutrophils—Neutrophils were incubated in phosphate-free buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5.7 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, and 0.025% bovine serum albumin) (14Dang P.M. Dewas C. Gaudry M. Fay M. Pedruzzi E. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. El Benna J. J. Biol.

The neutrophils were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before being exposed to IL-8 for 1-20 min. In some experiments the neutrophils were preincubated for 15 min with various kinase inhibitors before being treated with IL-8. In all cases, the reaction was stopped by adding ice-cold buffer and centrifugation at 400 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml NaF, 1 mg/ml Na3VO4, 0.5 mg/ml β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mg/ml P-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.2 mg/ml levamisol, 8% sucrose, 0.02 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml DNase I, 2.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate). The resuspension was sonicated on ice (3 times for 10 s). The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a TL100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman, Fullerton, CA), and cleared supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation studies. Immunoprecipitation of p47phox and p67phox—The cleared supernatant was incubated overnight with anti-p47phox (1/200) or anti-p67phox (1/200) antibodies; immune complexes were then immunoprecipitated using γ-bind G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and washed four times as described (14Dang P.M.

Neutrophil Membrane Preparation—Neutrophils were preincubated with 5 μm cytochalasin B for 5 min before being incubated with IL-8 (50 ng/ml, 3-20 min), with fMLP (10-7m for 3 min), or with cytochalasin B, used as control. Membranes were then prepared as previously described (14Dang P.M. Dewas C. Gaudry M. Fay M. Pedruzzi E. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. El Benna J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20704-20708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 108 neutrophils/ml were sonicated for three 10-s periods on ice in 1 ml of relaxation buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.3, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl) supplemented with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml eupeptic, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin. Cytosol and membrane fractions were separated by centrifuging at 200,000 × g on 15-50% (w/w) sucrose gradient for 45 min at 4 °C. Preparation of Lipid Rafts—Lipid rafts were isolated as previously described (23Vilhardt F. Van Deurs B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were incubated at 4 °C in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min, homogenized by 50 up and down strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, after which 80% sucrose stock in buffer A was added to the cell lysate to give a final concentration of 40% sucrose. The mixture was then layered under a sucrose step gradient (30 and 5% in buffer A) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Detergent-insoluble, cholesterolrich membrane fractions, representing membrane rafts, floated to the interphase between 5 and 30% sucrose layers, whereas solubilized proteins or cytoskeleton-associated, detergent-insoluble proteins remained in the pellet of the gradient. After spinning, 10 fractions were collected from the top of the tubes, and the pellet was solubilized by sonication. Electrophoresis and Blotting—The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 10% polyacrylamide gels or NuPAGE® Novex 4-12% BisTris gels, using standard techniques and Invitrogen techniques, respectively. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. After blocking in 1% milk, the membrane was probed with the anti-p47phox (1/5000 dilution), -p67phox (1/1000 dilution), -Rac2 (1/1000 dilution), -gp91phox (1/1000 dilution), -p22phox (1/100 dilution), -P-ERK1/2 (1/1000 dilution), or -P-p38 MAPK (1/1000 dilution) antibodies, and then with species-specific horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit or mouse antibodies, and developed with an ECL kit, using light-sensitive film (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed using the Scion Image analysis program from National Institutes of Health. Results from DRM experiments were expressed as the percentage of NADPH oxidase components in the DRMs (fractions 2-5). For 32P radioactivity quantification (cpm) of p47phox and p67phox, nitrocellulose membranes were analyzed in an Instant Imager apparatus (Packard) equipped with Instant Imager software. Radioactivity counts were corrected for the amounts of p47phox and p67phox present on the membrane measured by densitometric analysis. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy Analysis—After stimulation, the neutrophils (2 × 106/ml) were pooled and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit (10 μg/ml) and/or anti-rabbit polyclonal p22phox antibody raised against extracellular epitopes of the p22phox protein (1/10 dilution) for 30 min at 4 °C. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline, the samples were incubated with an Alexa 546-conjugated affinity purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/250) for 30 min at 4 °C. After extensive rinsing, neutrophils were then fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and cytospun. Glass coverslides were mounted and examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM-510-META, Zeiss, Germany) equipped with epifluorescent optics (×63 NA 1.3 oil-immersion objective). Simultaneous two-channel recording was performed with a pinhole size of 90 μm using excitation wavelengths of 488/588 nm, a 510/580 double dichroic mirror, and a 515-545 bandpass fluorescein isothiocyanate filter together with a 590-nm long pass filter. Double-labeled cells were analyzed separately to avoid leakage from one channel to another. As controls, the absence of staining was confirmed when the primary antibody was omitted. Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Significant differences were identified using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was taken to be significant. A Brief Incubation with IL-8 Was Sufficient to Prime the Neutrophil Oxidative Burst in Response to Formyl Peptides—The enzyme kinetics of O2⋅¯ production in response to fMLP and/or IL-8 monitored by ferricytochrome c reduction assay are presented in Fig. 1A. Incubation of isolated neutrophils with 10-7m of fMLP induced the rapid and transient production of O2⋅¯, whereas incubation with 50 ng/ml of IL-8 did not. The latter result was obtained regardless of the concentration of IL-8 (0.01-50 ng/ml) or the incubation time (2-45 min) used (not shown). In contrast, pre-exposure of the neutrophils to IL-8 (50 ng/ml) for 3 or 15 min enhanced both the initial. and maximum rates of O2⋅¯ production subsequently induced by 10-7m fMLP, whereas exposure to 1 ng/ml IL-8 did not. As previously reported (21Wozniak A. Betts W.H. Murphy G.A. Rokicinski M. Immunology. 1993; 79: 608-615PubMed Google Scholar), these findings suggest that IL-8 has a dose- and time-dependent priming effect on the O2⋅¯ production induced by fMLP. Pre-exposure of neutrophils for 20 min with increasing concentrations of IL-8 (0.01-50 ng/ml) enhanced the total production of O2⋅¯ induced by fMLP in a dose-dependent manner, up to a maximum response at 50 ng/ml IL-8 (Fig. 1B). The results from the kinetics study showed that the priming effect of IL-8 (50 ng/ml) on O2⋅¯ production first appeared after 2 min, and then progressively increased to plateau after incubating for 10 min (Fig. 1C). O2⋅¯ . production was inhibited by superoxide dismutase and diphenyleneiodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (not shown). Incubating neutrophils with neutralizing anti-IL-8 monoclonal antibody before adding the IL-8 and fMLP abolished ROS production (not shown). This finding rules out the possibility that endotoxin contamination was responsible for the priming effect of IL-8. IL-8 Induced the Phosphorylation of p47phox and p67phox in a Time-dependent Manner—The priming effect of the proinflammatory cytokines granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor α on the neutrophil-induced oxidative burst has been associated with specific, site-directed phosphorylations of the p47phox (13Dewas C.

Elia A.E. Wilker E. Yaffe M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27059-27068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the effect of IL-8 on the phosphorylation status of p47phox and p67phox. Short incubation times (1-5 min) with 50 ng/ml of IL-8 alone significantly increased p47phox phosphorylation compared with untreated cells, with a peak effect occurring after 3 min (Fig. 2A). The level of p47phox phosphorylation rapidly decreased after longer incubation times (5-15 min) with IL-8 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that IL-8 induced transient phosphorylation of p47phox in neutrophils. In contrast, IL-8 had a more delayed stimulating effect on the level of p67phox phosphorylation, which increased significantly only after being incubated for 10 min (Fig. 2B). For short (3 min) and longer (15 min) preincubation times, IL-8 (50 ng/ml) always significantly increased the levels of p47phox and p67phox phosphorylation produced by 10-7m fMLP (Fig. 3, A and B). These results suggested that IL-8 may trigger the sequential phosphorylations of p47phox and p67phox, which were potentiated in response to fMLP in parallel to O2⋅¯ . production.FIGURE 3IL-8 potentiates the phosphorylations of p47phox and p67phox induced by fMLP in human neutrophils.32P-Labeled neutrophils were incubated without or with 50 ng/ml IL-8 for 3 or 15 min and then with or without 10-7m fMLP for 3 min. 32P-p47phox (A) and 32P-p67phox (B) were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. Results are expressed as the percentage of phosphorylation levels from resting neutrophils. Values are mean ± S.E.

Genistein, a broad-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, reduced the IL-8-induced phosphorylation of both p47phox and p67phox (Fig. 4, A and B). Among the tyrosine kinases, the Tec kinases, and especially Btk, has been shown to contribute to fMLP-induced neutrophil responses by modulating the MAPK and PI3K/Akt/PKB pathways (31Gilbert C. Levasseur S. Desaulniers P. Dusseault A.A. Thibault N. Bourgoin S.G. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 5235-5243Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The role of Btk during the IL-8 priming process was previously unknown. Here we have shown that IL-8 treatment induced a rapid but transient (3-5 min) membrane translocation of Btk (Fig. 4C). In addition, leflunomide metabolite analog LFM-A13, a Btk inhibitor, significantly reduced the IL-8-induced phosphorylation of p47phox and p67phox (Fig. 4, A and B), whereas the inactive analog (LFM-A11) had no such inhibitory effect. We next analyzed the effect of IL-8 on PKC, Akt/PKB, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK, which are involved in the p47phox and/or p67phox phosphorylation in response to various stimuli (32Dewas C. Fay M. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. El-Benna J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5238-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 33Dang P.M. Cross A.R. Babior B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3001-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Preincubation with GF109203X, a PKC inhibitor, significantly reduced the level of early (3 min) IL-8-induced p47phox phosphorylation (Fig. 4A), but had no effect on the level of later (15 min) IL-8-induced p67phox phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, ERK1/2 and Akt/PKB phosphorylation transiently peaked after exposure to IL-8 for 3 min (Fig. 4C). The data showed that PD98059, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, reduced the level of the early (3 min) IL-8-induced phosphorylation of p47phox. Conversely, no inhibitory effect of PD98059 was detected on the later (15 min) IL-8-induced phosphorylation of p67phox (Fig. 4B). After 5 min, IL-8 triggered the activation of p38 MAPK, which slowly declined during the following 20-min incubation period (Fig. 4C). Consistently with these results, SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, significantly reduced the level of late (15 min) IL-8-induced p67phox phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that ERK1/2 is involved in the early IL-8-induced p47phox phosphorylation, and that p38 MAPK is involved in the late IL-8-induced p67phox phosphorylation. Furthermore, LFM-A13, a Btk inhibitor, significantly reduced the IL-8-induced early activation of ERK1/2 and Akt/PKB, and the IL-8-induced late activation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 4D). Thus, Btk seems to be involved in the upstream transduction pathways leading to the phosphorylation of p47phox and p67phox. IL-8 Induced the Sequential Translocation of p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2 to the Plasma Membrane in a Time-dependent Manner—The phosphorylation of the cytosol components p47phox and p67phox induced by stimuli such as phorbol myristate acetate or fMLP has been implicated in their translocation to the plasma membrane, and their subsequent assembly at flavocytochrome b558 (28Benna J.E.

These studies examined the role of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) signaling system in UVB-mediated effects. Expression of the PAF receptor in the PAF receptor-negative epidermoid cell line KB augmented apoptosis in response to UVB irradiation. Overexpression of the PAF receptor in primary human keratinocytes also enhanced UVB-mediated apoptosis in vitro, and it enhanced apoptosis in an in vivo model of human keratinocytes grafted onto severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice. To define the mechanism by which UVB activates the PAF receptor, we used mass spectrometry to demonstrate significant amounts of the C4 PAF analogs 1-alkyl-2-(butanoyl and butenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, as well as native PAF in an epidermal cell line after UVB irradiation. Supplementing the cells with the precursor phospholipid 1-hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (HAPC) increased the amount of C4 PAF analogs recovered after UVB exposure. We irradiated HAPC directly and found, even in the absence of a photosensitizer, fragmentation to C4-PAF receptor ligands. We conclude UVB photo-oxidizes cellular phospholipids, creating PAF analogs that stimulate the PAF receptor to induce further PAF synthesis and apoptosis.

PAF is the most potent phospholipid agonist yet identified, where its high affinity recognition by the PAF receptor depends on its sn-1 ether bond and a short sn-2 acetyl residue (5O'Flaherty J.T.

PAF is synthesized in response to diverse stimuli, including cytokines, endotoxins, and Ca2+ ionophores, and in response to PAF itself (1Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 419-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 2Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The synthetic pathway consists of two enzymes; a phospholipase A2 that generates the lysolipid backbone by releasing the fatty acyl residue esterified at the sn-2 position of alkyl phosphatidylcholines, and a PAF acetyltransferase activity that transfers an acetyl residue from acetyl-CoA to this newly generated lysolipid. Both activities are tightly regulated, with increased intracellular Ca2+ being the premier agent for their activation. Ligands that activate the PAF receptor are generated in a second way, and this route is not subject to cellular control. The alkyl phospholipid pool is enriched at the sn-2 position with polyunsaturated arachidonoyl residues (7Mueller H.W. O'Flaherty J.T. Greene D.G. Samuel M.P. Wykle R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 383-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and polyunsaturated fatty acids, esterified or not, are susceptible to oxidation. Oxidation of polyunsaturated acyl chains introduces oxy functions (aldehydes, ketones, peroxides, alcohols, and carboxylates) to the chain of carbon atoms, rearranges bonds, and fragments carbon–carbon bonds by β-scission (8Frankel E.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1984; 23: 197-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), all of which generate a myriad of reaction products. Among these products of polyunsaturated phospholipid oxidation are a series of phospholipids with oxidatively fragmented sn-2 acyl residues that terminate with either an ω-oxy function or a methyl group (9Tokumura A.

It is therefore difficult to predict a priori the actual mediator generated by oxidative stress, and accumulation of chemically generated PAF receptor ligands has not been demonstrated by cells exposed to stimuli they encounter in their environment. UVB radiation (290–320 nm) has profound effects on keratinocytes of human skin, in part because it is a pro-oxidative stressor (20Barber L.A. Spandau D.F. Rathman S.C. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A.

UVB is immunosuppressive and facilitates progression of non-melanoma skin cancer, and it is proposed (23Walterscheid J.P. Ullrich S.E. Nghiem D.X. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) that PAF and/or PAF-like lipids mediate this systemic immune suppression. The identity of the one or more actual mediators that couple UVB to cytokine production, immunosuppression, and cell death is unknown. Here we show that UVB photooxidizes polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine and identify the PAF receptor ligands generated in this process. We suggest that UVB-generated PAF agonists are involved in the cutaneous inflammation and immunomodulation seen in response to UVB irradiation. Cells—The human epidermoid cell line KB was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergen, Purchase, NY) containing 10 μm arachidonic acid. A KB PAF receptor model system was created by transduction of PAF receptor-negative KB cells with the MSCV 2.1 retrovirus encoding the human leukocyte PAF receptor as described previously (21Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). KB cells stably transduced with the PAF receptor (designated KBP cells) or with fMLP receptor (designated as KBF cells) or control MSCV2.1 retrovirus (defined as KBM cells) were characterized by Southern, Northern, radioligand binding, and calcium transient studies that demonstrate the presence of a functional PAF or fMLP receptor signaling system in these cells (21Pei Y. Barber L.A. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Dy L.C. Fertel R.H. Nguyen T.M. Williams D.A. Travers J.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1954-1961PubMed Google Scholar). UVB Irradiation Source—Cells were irradiated with UVB as previously described (20Barber L.A. Spandau D.F. Rathman S.C. Murphy R.C. Johnson C.A. Kelley S.W. Hurwitz S.A. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18891-18897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The UV source was a Philips F20T12/UV-B lamp (270–390 nm, containing 2.6% UVC, 43.6% UVB, and 53.8% UVA). The intensity of the UVB source was measured prior to each experiment using an IL1700 radiometer and a SED240 UVB detector (International Light, Newburyport, MA) at a distance of 8 cm from the UVB source to the monolayer of cells/purified lipid. PAF Receptor Phosphorylation—KB cells were transduced with a PAF receptor construct that contained three FLAG tags at the carboxyl terminus (KBP-Flag3) for these immunoprecipitation studies. KBP-Flag3 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes to confluence and then washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with 32PO4 for 2 h before being stimulated by UVB (400 J/m2) or carbamyl-PAF (100 nm) for either 10 or 20 min (24Richardson R.M. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The cells were rapidly washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the PAF receptor was immunoprecipitated as described before (26Robeva A.S. Woodard R. Luthin D.R. Taylor H.E. Linden J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 51: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) before its phosphorylation was assessed by autoradiography. EGF Receptor Phosphorylation—Irradiated cells were obtained by exposing KBM and KBP cells to UVB light for the stated time intervals. Following this, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P40) containing 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science) to inhibit plasma PAF acetylhydrolase and 10 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 20 min on ice. The EGF receptor was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates by incubation with a polyclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody (Ab1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and protein G plus/protein A-agarose (Calbiochem) overnight at 4 °C. Specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated EGF receptor was determined by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Ab-4, Calbiochem) and detecting the reaction product with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoprecipitated and electrophoretically resolved proteins were reprobed with anti-EGF receptor antibody to establish that the wells contained equal amounts of material (27Marques S.A. Dy L.C. Southall M.D. Yi Q. Smietana E. Kapur R. Marques M. Travers J.B. Spandau D.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 1026-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with (10 mm) Trolox, a water-soluble analog of antioxidant vitamin E, for 30 min (Calbiochem) before exposing the cells to UVB. In other experiments, cells were stimulated with carbamyl-PAF (100 nm, BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA), a phospholipase A1- and A2-resistant analog of PAF that is a PAF receptor ligand and agonist. Caspase-3 Assay—Caspase-3 activity was determined in cell lysates derived from primary cultures of human keratinocytes (HK cells) that were transduced with the PAF receptor (HK-PAF-R) or retroviral vector (HK-NIE). Caspase-3 activation was also determined in an epithelioid cell line (KB cells) stably transfected with the PAF receptor (KBP cells) or the seven-transmembrane receptor family member for fMLP (KBF cells). A synthetic fluorogenic substrate (acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-AMC, Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), which releases fluorogenic AMC after hydrolysis, was used to assay activated caspase-3. Fluorescence of AMC was measured by excitation at 380 nm with emission at 460 nm (28Li T. Southall M.D. Yi Q. Pei Y. Lewis D. Al-Hassani M. Spandau D. Travers J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16614-16621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity of the reaction products was compared with a standard of AMC (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and normalized to cellular protein using a NanoOrange protein quantitation kit (Molecular Probes). Apoptosis in Xenografts of HKPAF-R and HKNIE Cells—Primary cultures of human keratinocytes (HKs) obtained from neonatal foreskins were transduced with the PAF-R and xenografts of HKPAF-R and control retroviral-expressing HKNIE cells were established in immunosuppressed NOD/LtSz-scid/scid mice as described before (29Spandau D.F. Marques M. Bierhuizen M. Wagemaker G. Hurwitz S. Pei Y. Breese R. Travers J.B. Exp. Dermatol. 2000; 9: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These xenografts were irradiated with 1000 J/m2 UVB, and the tissue was harvested 24 h later, fixed in 10% formalin, and counterstained with methyl green. PARP cleavage, as a measure of caspase activation, was examined with anti-PARP antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) at a dilution of 1:100. Caspase-3 activation was determined in parallel using an antibody (BD Pharmingen), which detected only the activated form of caspase-3 at a dilution of 1:100. Secondary rabbit anti-mouse antibody was from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) and visualized by immunoperoxidase using rabbit immunoCruz staining system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Lipid Manipulation and Analysis—Total lipids from KBM cells exposed or not to UVB were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42321) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were isolated with aminopropyl columns (JT Baker Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ) by solid phase extraction and then subjected to reverse-phase HPLC separation as described earlier (6Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

Isocratic HPLC fractions were collected at 1 ml/min, and fractions containing leukocyte agonists, determined by the bioassay described below, were pooled. In a few experiments, a portion of the pooled HPLC fraction was subjected to extensive treatment with phospholipase A1 (Rhizopus arrhizus, Sigma) to remove diacyl phospholipids (6Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria Neto H. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol.

PAF, with its lipase-insensitive sn-1 ether bond, was the negative control for PLA1 treatment, whereas 1-palmitoyl-2-acetyl sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (acyl-PAF, BIOMOL Research Laboratories) served as the positive control. Measurement of Intracellular Ca2+ Flux in Human Neutrophils—Human neutrophils were freshly isolated by dextran sedimentation and centrifugation over Ficoll as described (31Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1985; 76: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Isolated neutrophils (2.25 × 106/ml) were then loaded with FURA-2AM (Molecular Probes) as before (6Marathe G.K. Davies S.S. Harrison K.A. Silva A.R. Murphy R.C. Castro-Faria Neto H. Prescott S.M.

A graded amount of authentic PAF (BIOMOL) or C4-PAF analogs (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) was usedtoestablishtheconcentration-responserelationshipoftheseprimarycells. In a few experiments FURA-2AM-loaded cells were pretreated with the PAF receptor antagonist BN52021 (20 μm, BIOMOL) and then tested for agonist-stimulated calcium transients. In other experiments, biologically active lipid fractions were pretreated with 10μg of recombinant human PAF acetylhydrolase (ICOS Corp., Bothell, WA) in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.5% human serum albumin for 1 h at 37°C before being tested as agonists of the leukocyte PAF receptor. Oxidation of Synthetic Phospholipids by UVB—Synthetic 1-O-hexadecyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (HAPC) was from any of several sources (BIOMOL, Sigma, or Avanti Polar lipids). During these studies we noted that material from Sigma expressed large amounts of pre-existing leukocyte agonists, whereas that from Avanti was devoid of this material. For the cell-free irradiation of HAPC, 1 mg of compound was dried under N2 gas on a polystyrene tissue culture plate prewashed four times with methanol. Following either sham (non-irradiation, left open on the bench top) or UVB irradiation, the lipid was removed with methanol. The lipids were then extracted (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42321) Google Scholar) and subjected either to mass spectral analysis or bioassay. Lipids to be used for bioassays were dried under a stream of N2, resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% human serum albumin, and then sonicated. Oxygen was excluded in some experiments by placing the UVB source and plates inside a transparent plastic bag and filled with argon during the irradiation. Mass Spectral Analysis of PAF and PAF-like Lipids—Liquid chromatography MS/MS analysis of synthetic phospholipids, butanoyl-PAF, and the photo oxidation products of HAPC were carried out on an API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The reversed-phase HPLC system utilized a Columbus C18 1- × 150-mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The mobile phase solvent system consisted of methanol:20 mm ammonium acetate in water:acetonitrile in a ratio of 80:15:5 (v/v) for solvent A and methanol for solvent B. Initial conditions were 20% B for 5 min, linearly increasing from 20% to 70% B by 18 min, and remaining at 70% B until 26 min, after which it returned to initial conditions of 20% B. The collision-induced decomposition spectra of butanoyl-PAF and butenoyl-PAF were obtained by collisional activation of the acetate adducts in the negative ion mode. The spray voltage was -4000 V with nitrogen as collision gas, and the collision energy was set at -50 V. Multiple reaction monitoring methods, which are sensitive and specific, were developed based on the collision-induced decomposition results to detect and quantify products from photo-oxidation experiments. To confirm the presence of butanoyl-PAF in UVB-irradiated KB cells, lipids were extracted (30Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42321) Google Scholar). Phospholipids were further purified by solid phase extraction on a silica column (Supelco), subjected to the above reversed-phase HPLC separation, and 30-s fractions from 10 to 25 min were collected in a 96-well plate. These fractions were analyzed with a Nanomate (Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY) nanospray interface coupled to a 4000 Q Trap (Applied Biosystems). Negative ion full scan confirmed the presence of ions consistent with PAF-like compounds; these were then collisionally activated in the product ion mode to generate collision-induced decomposition spectra. The conditions were as follows: the Nanomate spray pressure was 0.35 p.s.i. with a spray voltage of 1.35 kV, the 4000 Q Trap used nitrogen as the collision gas, and the collision energy was -59 V.

https://openalex.org/W2000529632,"We recently characterized a large developmentally regulated gene family in Leishmania encoding the amastin surface proteins. While studying the regulation of these genes, we identified a region of 770 nucleotides (nt) within the 2055-nt 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) that regulates stage-specific gene expression at the level of translation. An intriguing feature of this 3′-UTR regulatory region is the presence of a ∼450-nt element that is highly conserved among several Leishmania mRNAs. Here we show, using a luciferase reporter system and polysome profiling experiments, that the 450-nt element stimulates translation initiation of the amastin mRNA in response to heat shock, which is the main environmental change that the parasite encounters upon its entry into the mammalian host. Deletional analyses depicted a second region of ∼100 nucleotides located at the 3′-end of several amastin transcripts, which also activates translation in response to elevated temperature. Both 3′-UTR regulatory elements act in an additive manner to stimulate amastin mRNA translation. In addition, we show that acidic pH encountered in the phagolysosomes of macrophages, the location of parasitic differentiation, triggers the accumulation of amastin transcripts by a distinct mechanism that is independent of the 450-nt and 100-nt elements. Overall, these important findings support the notion that stage-specific post-transcriptional regulation of the amastin mRNAs in Leishmania is complex and involves the coordination of distinct mechanisms controlling mRNA stability and translation that are independently triggered by key environmental signals inducing differentiation of the parasite within macrophages.

The protozoan parasite Leishmania constitutes a major health problem in several endemic tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world, threatening over 350 million people of which more than 15 million are infected (1Ashford R.W. Desjeux P. de Raadt P. Parasitol. Today. 1996; 8: 104-105Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 2Ashford R.W. Int. J. Parasitol. 2000; 30: 1269-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). At least 20 different Leishmania species are responsible for the various clinical manifestations of leishmaniasis, ranging from chronic skin ulcers (L. major, L. tropica, and L. mexicana) to more severe naso-pharynx mucosal destruction (L. braziliensis) or life-threatening visceral diseases (L. donovani, L. infantum, and L. chagasi) (3Herwaldt B.L. Lancet. 1999; 354: 1191-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). No effective vaccine is currently available against Leishmania infections, and resistance to the main anti-leishmanial agents is dramatically increasing in several endemic areas (4Sundar S. Trop. Med. Int. Health. 2001; 6: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). These facts have underscored the urgency of identification of new drug targets for chemotherapy and/or vaccine development.The life cycle of Leishmania includes two developmental stages: the extracellular promastigote form, transmitted to the mammalian host by the sand fly vector, and the amastigote form, adapted to resist and replicate within the threatening environment of the phagolysosomes. This adaptation requires a dynamic process implicating morphological and physiological changes within the parasite (5Glaser B. Gothe R. Tierarztl. Prax. Ausg. K. Klientiere.

To date, several amastigote-specific genes have been characterized in Leishmania (reviewed in Ref. 10Papadopoulou B. Boucher N. McNicoll F. Wu Y. Dubé M. El-Fakhry Y. Huang X.F. J. Parasitol. 2003; 89: S174-S181Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Due to the absence of transcriptional control in Leishmania, stage-specific regulation of gene expression occurs exclusively at the post-transcriptional level (reviewed in Ref. 11Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and involves mainly sequences within the 3′-UTR 5The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionntnucleotide(s). 5The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionntnucleotide(s). of mRNAs that determine mRNA abundance by modulating RNA stability (12Aly R.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying stage-specific regulation of gene expression in this parasite are not yet understood. Recent microarray analyses suggested that only ∼1–2% of L. major genes show significant changes in their mRNA levels (2-fold or more) throughout the life cycle of the parasite (18Akopyants N.S.

Similar data were obtained with the related parasite Trypanosoma brucei, where only ∼2% of mRNAs showed more than 2-fold differences in expression (20Diehl S. Diehl F. El-Sayed N.M. Clayton C. Hoheisel J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 123: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, recent proteomic analyses revealed that ∼9% of the Leishmania proteins are differentially expressed in the amastigote stage (21Bente M. Harder S. Wiesgigl M. Heukeshoven J. Gelhaus C.

This difference between large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic studies further outlines the importance of translational and post-translational control in regulating gene expression in this organism.We previously identified a developmentally regulated gene family in Leishmania encoding the amastin surface proteins (14Wu Y. El-Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that share homology with the T. cruzi amastin proteins (23Teixeira S.M. Russell D.G. Kirchhoff L.V. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20509-20516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently characterized this large gene family in Leishmania and showed that it comprises up to 45 members, the majority of which are specifically expressed in the intracellular amastigote stage of the parasite (24Rochette A. McNicoll F. Girard J. Breton M. Leblanc E. Bergeron M.G. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 140: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Developmental regulation of the amastin transcripts in Leishmania (14Wu Y. El-Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22586-22594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) is mediated by defined regions within the 3′-UTR that are different in size and in sequence composition. While studying one of the L. infantum amastin gene homologs, we delimited a region of 770 nt within the 3′-UTR that regulates stage-specific gene expression most likely at the level of translation (15Boucher N. Wu Y. Dumas C. Dube M. Sereno D. Breton M. Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19511-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). An intriguing feature of this 3′-UTR regulatory region is the presence of a ∼450-nt element that is highly conserved not only among the majority of the amastin transcripts (24Rochette A. McNicoll F. Girard J. Breton M. Leblanc E. Bergeron M.G. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 140: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) but also among several other Leishmania mRNAs, including known amastigote-specific mRNAs (15Boucher N. Wu Y. Dumas C. Dube M. Sereno D. Breton M. Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19511-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the 450-nt element stimulates translation of the amastin mRNAs in response to heat shock, which is the major environmental change that the parasite encounters upon its transmission from the sandfly to the mammalian host. Furthermore, we show that a second region of ∼100 nt located at the 3′-end of several amastin transcripts activates also amastin translation in response to elevated temperature. Importantly, we describe here that acidic pH encountered in the phagolysosomes, the location of differentiation of the parasite, has no effect on amastin translational regulation, but it triggers the accumulation of amastin transcripts specifically in the amastigote stage by a distinct mechanism that is independent of the 450-nt and 100-nt-mediated translational control. Overall, our findings support the notion that stage-specific post-transcriptional regulation of the amastin transcripts in Leishmania is complex and involves the coordination of different mechanisms that are independently triggered by key environmental signals inducing promastigote to amastigote differentiation within macrophages.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines, Leishmania Culture, and Macrophage Infections in Vitro— The Leishmania infantum MHOM/MA/67/ITMAP-263 strain used in this study was described previously (26Sereno D.

Promastigotes were cultured at pH 7.0 and 25 °C in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Multicell, Wisent Inc.) and 5 μg/ml hemin. L. infantum promastigote to amastigote differentiation in a host-free culture and the maintenance of axenic amastigotes were performed as previously described (22El-Fakhry Y. Ouellette M. Papadopoulou B. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 1007-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Sereno D. Lemesre J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 972-976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, late stationary phase promastigotes (in average 6-day promastigotes) were inoculated in MAA/20 medium in 25-cm2-ventilated flasks and grown at 37 °C and pH 5.8 with 5% CO2 for ∼5 days until they fully differentiated to amastigote-like forms. Axenic amastigotes remained stable in culture, and after two to three passages they were recycled back to promastigotes to maintain their pathogenic potential. Axenic amastigotes grown under these conditions show morphological, biochemical, and biological characteristics similar to those of in vivo isolated amastigotes and are capable of infecting macrophages (28El Fadili K. Messier N. Leprohon P. Roy G. Guimond C. Trudel N. Saravia N.G. Papadopoulou B. Legare D. Ouellette M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 1988-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In vitro infections of the THP-1 human leukemia monocyte cell line with Leishmania stationary promastigotes were carried out as previously reported (14Wu Y. El-Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S.

The luciferase activity of the recombinant parasites was determined in both stages of the parasite's life cycle essentially as described elsewhere (15Boucher N. Wu Y. Dumas C. Dube M. Sereno D.

The remaining vectors expressing the LUC-chimeric transcripts listed in Fig. 1B were made as follows. Briefly, various parts of the 770-nt 3′-UTR regulatory region of the L. infantum LinJ34.0840 amastin gene homolog (14Wu Y. El-Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem.

PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and cloned into the BamHI site of vector pSPYNEOαLUC-IR downstream of the firefly luciferase (LUC) open reading frame. In plasmid LUC-550, a region of 550 nucleotides containing the conserved 450-nt element flanked by ∼40 and 60 nucleotides on either side was amplified using primers P5′-550 (5′-CGGGATCCCGCCTCGGGCCCCTCGC-3′) and P3′-550 (5′-CGGGATCCCGTGCCAGGAAAAACAG-3′). In vector LUC-450, the 450-nt element was amplified with P5′-450 (5′-GTGGATCCCTAACTACACTTTC-3′) and P3′-450 (5′-CTAGATCTGCGACGGACAAGTC-3′). In vector LUC-300, the last 300 nucleotides of the amastin 3′-UTR were amplified with primers P5′-300 (5′-ACTTGTCCGTCGCGGAGTAAG-3′) and P3′-300 (5′-CGGGATCCCGGAGGAACGGAGACAA-3′). In LUC-200R, the last 200 nucleotides of the amastin 3′-UTR were amplified using primers P5′-200R (5′-CGGGATCCCGTATACACTATACACATATGT-3′) and P3′-300. Primers P5′-300 and P3′-200L (5′-CGGGATCCCGCCGTCGCGGAGTAAG-3′) were used to amplify the first 200 nucleotides of the 300-nt region (LUC-200L). The vector 5′-UTR-LUC-770 was made by a three-step cloning. First, vector pGEM3-NEO (31Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) was digested with SacI and SmaI and ligated to the SacI-NsiI 340-bp fragment containing the 5′-UTR sequence of the amastin mRNA (211 nt) (14Wu Y. El-Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), amplified by PCR (5′-ATGTCCTCGCCACTCTCCCC-3′ and 5′-CTTCGGTAAATCCGCAACAG-3′), and to the LUC-770 PstI-PvuII fragment containing the LUC gene fused to the 770-nt region of the amastin 3′-UTR. The plasmid copy number in each transfectant was evaluated by Southern blot and PhosphorImager analysis, and it was found to be similar for the different LUC-containing constructs (data not shown). The BT1-LUC, BT1-LUC-770, and BT1-LUC-300 constructs (see Fig. 3A) were made as follows. Vectors LUC-770, LUC-300, and LUC control (see Fig. 1B) were digested with HpaI and HindIII, filled in with Klenow and subcloned into the unique NotI site (also filled in with Klenow) of vector pSP-BT1 that contains the open reading frame of the biopterin transporter 1 gene (BT1) (32Kündig C. Haimeur A. Légaré D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For genomic integration into the BT1 locus, ∼2.5 μg of HpaI-HindIII digests (these enzymes cut on either side of BT1) containing the different targeting cassettes were transfected by electroporation into L. infantum as described elsewhere (31Papadopoulou B. Roy G. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Approximately 10–20 μg of purified plasmid DNA (Qiagen) was used for transfections. Transfected cells were plated on SDM-79 (2X) medium with 1.5% agar and 0.01 mg/ml of G418 (Sigma), and individual clones were obtained after 2–3 weeks.FIGURE 3Genomic integration of the amastin 3′-UTR regulatory elements to evaluate their role in stage-specific post-transcriptional regulation. A, schematic representation of the targeting cassettes for the genomic integration of both 3′-UTR regulatory elements of the amastin mRNA (450 and 100 nt) (BT1-LUC-770) or of the 100-nt region alone (BT1-LUC-300) fused to the LUC coding region into the L. infantum biopterin transporter 1 (BT1) locus, which is constitutively expressed. BT1-LUC is the control construct lacking any 3′-UTR regulatory sequence. For genomic integration by homologous recombination, the above targeting cassettes were excised with HpaI and HindIII digestion and introduced as linear fragments into L. infantum by electroporation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Positions of key restriction enzymes for analyzing the genotypes of the different transfectants are indicated. B, Southern blot analysis to verify correct integration of LUC-chimeric constructs into the BT1 locus. Genomic DNA from the different transfectants (clones were used here) was extracted, digested with PstI or NcoI, transferred onto nylon membrane, and hybridized to a probe specific for the BT1 gene. Homozygous BT1 mutants with the two BT1 alleles (the Leishmania genome is diploid) successfully disrupted by the LUC-chimeric constructs were obtained in all three cases. C, Northern blot hybridization with a probe corresponding to the LUC coding region to evaluate the effect of both 3′-UTR regulatory elements (450 and 100 nt) on mRNA accumulation in both developmental stages of the parasite (P, promastigotes; A, amastigotes). The expression of the endogenous amastin transcript was verified by hybridization using a probe specific to the amastin 3′-UTR (14Wu Y. El-Fakhry Y. Sereno D. Tamar S. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total RNA were used as indicated by ethidium bromide staining. D, luciferase reporter assays with L. infantum recombinant parasites expressing the integrated LUC-chimeric constructs grown as axenic amastigotes. The results are presented as the relative luciferase -fold increase compared with the control (BT1-LUC).

Total RNA of L. infantum promastigotes and axenic amastigotes was isolated using the TRIzol™ reagent (Invitrogen). Southern and Northern blot hybridizations were performed following standard procedures (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Leishmania cells were lysed and protein lysates were sonicated (10 pulses). The proteins were quantified using Amido Black 10B (Bio-Rad), and 50 μg of total protein lysates was loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels for Western blot analyses. The gels were transferred on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) and incubated for 1 h in blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk). Then the first antibody (a goat anti-luciferase pAB, Promega) was added for 90 min in 1:1000 dilution. Following a few washes with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, a donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted at 1:5000 was added for 60 min. After additional washes, the blot was visualized by chemiluminescence using a Renaissance kit (New Life Science Products). LUC RNA and protein levels were estimated by densitometric analyses using a PhosphorImager with ImageQuaNT 3.1 software. An anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was also used to verify equal protein loading on SDS-PAGE gels for Western blot analysis.Sucrose Gradient Analysis—Approximately 3 × 109 L. infantum axenic amastigotes grown up to late logarithmic phase were first incubated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with a Dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% IGEPAL, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 100 units/ml RNAguard (Amersham Biosciences), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Leishmania lysates were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (40 A260 nm units) was layered on top of a 15% to 45% linear sucrose gradient (10 ml) in gradient buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 units/ml RNAguard). The gradient was made with the Gradient Maker (#GM-100, CBS Scientific Co.). Ribosomal subunits (40 S and 60 S), monosomes (80 S), and polyribosomes were sedimented by centrifugation in a Beckman SW40 Ti rotor at 35,000 rpm for 2 h and 15 min at 4 °C as previously described (34Khandjian E.W. Corbin F. Woerly S. Rousseau F. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 91-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 35Mangus D.A. Jacobson A. Methods. 1999; 17: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, approximately sixteen 0.6-ml fractions were collected at 4 °C using an ISCO Density Gradient Fractionation System under constant monitoring of absorption at 254 nm. The positions of the 40 S, 60 S, and 80 S and polysomal peaks were also corroborated by Northern blot analysis using an 18 S rRNA-specific probe. RNA was extracted from each fraction by phenol-chloroform and followed by ethanol precipitation and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization.RESULTSTwo Distinct 3′-UTR Elements Contribute to Stage-specific Regulation of the Amastin mRNA—We recently characterized a large family of developmentally regulated genes in Leishmania-encoding surface proteins, named amastins (24Rochette A. McNicoll F. Girard J. Breton M. Leblanc E. Bergeron M.G. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 140: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In one of the L. infantum amastin gene homologs that we have studied in more detail, we identified a region of 770 nt in the 3′-UTR (Fig. 1A) that regulates stage-specific gene expression most likely at the level of translation (15Boucher N. Wu Y. Dumas C. Dube M. Sereno D. Breton M. Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19511-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the first ∼450 nucleotides of this regulatory region (Fig. 1A) were found to be conserved among several known amastigote-specific mRNAs in Leishmania, including the majority of the amastin transcripts (15Boucher N. Wu Y. Dumas C. Dube M. Sereno D. Breton M. Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19511-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Rochette A. McNicoll F. Girard J. Breton M. Leblanc E. Bergeron M.G. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 140: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). With the nucleotide sequence of the L. major and L. infantum genomes now completed, in silico screening depicted several hundreds of intergenic sequences that share variable levels of homology with the 450-nt element (data not shown). We initially hypothesized that this 450-nt conserved element was responsible for the 770-nt-mediated translational regulation of the amastin mRNA. To test this hypothesis, we made a series of deletions within the 770-nt region that we cloned downstream of the firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter gene (Fig. 1B). These LUC-chimeric constructs were transfected into Leishmania as part of episomal expression vectors, and LUC activities were measured in recombinant parasites grown in both developmental life stages using axenic culture systems and macrophage infections in vitro (Fig. 1B). As previously shown (15Boucher N. Wu Y. Dumas C. Dube M. Sereno D. Breton M. Papadopoulou B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19511-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the 770-nt region in construct LUC-770 increases LUC activity by more than 16-fold, specifically in amastigotes. The complete 450-nt element in vector LUC-450, surprisingly, confers low levels of LUC induction (∼2.5-fold). Recent BLAST analyses on the complete Leishmania genome (www.genedb.org/), and more careful sequence comparison studies between the 3′-UTRs of the 45 amastin gene homologs (24Rochette A. McNicoll F. Girard J. Breton M. Leblanc E. Bergeron M.G. Papadopoulou B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 140: 205-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) indicated that the region of homology extends by a few nucleotides of each side of the 450-nt element (data not shown). Based on this updated information, we made a new construct with 550 nt that contains ∼60 nt (5′-side) and ∼40 nt (3′-side) of either side of the 450-nt element. The LUC-550 construct confers higher induction of LUC activity (∼8-fold), which represents, however, half the regulation conferred by the 770-nt region (Fig. 1B). Extending the 3′-side by 50 more nucleotides did not increase further LUC activity (data not shown). These results suggest that the full-length element is required for regulation and that the extremities of the element may be critical for stabilizing an RNA secondary structure. Moreover, our deletion data suggest that other sequences within the 770-nt region located downstream of the 450-nt element may be involved in translational regulation of the amastin transcript.To examine this possibility, we fused the last ∼300 nt of the 770-nt region to the LUC coding region (LUC-300) and tested whether this sequence was capable of promoting the induction of LUC activity specifically in amastigotes. Indeed, the LUC-300 construct induces LUC activity by 8-fold, similarly to the levels of regulation by the 450-nt element in construct LUC-550 (Fig. 1B). A deletion of 100 nucleotides of either side of the 300-nt region in constructs LUC-200L (L for left side) and LUC-200R (R for right side), respectively, has no effect on regulation hence delimiting the second regulatory sequence of the amastin mRNA to an internal region of ∼100 nt (see Fig. 1B).

They are composed of over 20 different proteins that associate into a basal structure that traverses both inner and outer bacterial membranes and a hollow, needle-like structure through which toxins travel. The PscF protein is the main component of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa T3S needle. Here we demonstrate that PscF, when purified on its own, is able to form needle-like fibers of 8 nm in width and >1 μm in length. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that the T3S needle subunit requires two cytoplasmic partners, PscE and PscG, in P. aeruginosa, which trap PscF in a ternary, 1:1:1 complex, thus blocking it in a monomeric state. Knock-out mutants deficient in PscE and PscG are non-cytotoxic, lack PscF, and are unable to export PscF encoded extrachromosomally. Temperature-scanning circular dichroism measurements show that the PscE-PscF-PscG complex is thermally stable and displays a cooperative unfolding/refolding pattern. Thus, PscE and PscG prevent PscF from polymerizing prematurely in the P. aeruginosa cytoplasm and keep it in a secretion prone conformation, strategies which may be shared by other pathogens that employ the T3S system for infection.

Such nanomachines, which play key roles in functions such as virulence and symbiosis, are composed of ∼20 distinct proteins, and translocated effectors possess diverse enzymatic activities and target major cellular processes ranging from actin assembly to apoptosis (1Hueck C.J.

The needle is essential for secretion and translocation and is the hollow conduit through which effectors travel to reach the target cell (9Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S.

Effectors and translocators are thought to travel in partially unfolded states through the needle, which, in all bacteria studied to date, is mostly composed of one polymerized small molecular mass protein (PrgI in Salmonella sp., MxiH in Shigella sp., and YscF in Yersinia sp.)

Although the precise steps involved in needle assembly are still unclear, many details can be inferred from studies performed on the Salmonella SPI-1-encoded and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli T3S systems, which suggest that only upon full assembly of the basal structure can needle components be secreted and subsequently polymerize onto the surface of the cell (23Sukhan A.

Interestingly, even though cognate molecules must be released from the chaperone prior to secretion, association constants between these complexes are in the nanomolar range (27Cheng L.W.

The mechanism of dissociation of these tight complexes is still unknown, but it is conceivable that the ATPase located on the cytosolic side of the base structure, which is believed to couple ATP hydrolysis and effector translocation through the T3S conduit, may also play the role of “docking platform” (22Stebbins C.E. Galan J.E. Nature. 2001; 414: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 33Gauthier A. Finlay B.B. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6747-6755Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 34Thomas J. Stafford G.P. Hughes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3945-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To date, chaperones have been reported as being dedicated molecules, binding to one or, at most, two effectors or translocators (35Parsot C. Hamiaux C. Page A.L. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Chaperones that bind to building blocks of filament or flagellum-forming proteins play the key role of preventing early polymerization of their cognate molecules (32Yip C.K. Finlay B.B. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 36Auvray F. Thomas J. Fraser G.M. Hughes C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This is the case for FliC units, which polymerize at the distal end of a growing flagellum; within the bacterial cytoplasm, FliC is chaperoned by FliS, which traps it in a monomeric state (36Auvray F. Thomas J. Fraser G.M. Hughes C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Likewise, CesA, a small acidic chaperone, prevents oligomerization of EspA, a protein that forms a filamentous structure prolonging the T3S needle, observed uniquely in enteropathogenic E. coli strains (32Yip C.K. Finlay B.B. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). However, the identity of chaperones recognizing the T3S needle-forming subunits, as well as the mechanism behind T3S needle formation, have remained elusive. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen responsible for severe nosocomial infections as well as untreatable chronic disease in cystic fibrosis patients (37Lyczak J.B. Cannon C.L. Pier G.B. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1051-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 38Lyczak J.B. Cannon C.L. Pier G.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 15: 194-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of clinical isolates is strictly dependent on a functional type III injectisome that is able to translocate four distinct effectors/exoenzymes (ExoS, ExoT, ExoU, and ExoY), all of which play key roles in eukaryotic cell intoxication (39Berthelot P. Attree I. Plesiat P. Chabert J. de Bentzmann S. Pozzetto B. Grattard F. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 188: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Roy-Burman A. Savel R.H. Racine S. Swanson B.L.

Frank D.W. Doroques D.B. Long T. Gropper M.A. Wiener-Kronish J.P. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3242-3249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genes required for assembly, regulation, and function of the T3S system in P. aeruginosa are located on the bacterial chromosome and clustered in five operons, one of which, exsDpscBCDEFGHIJKL (Fig. 1A), encodes needle assembly components, among others. Notably, purified P. aeruginosa T3S needles are composed mostly of PscF, and a deletion mutant of this gene loses the ability to secrete effector proteins into culture supernatants or translocate molecules into the host cell cytoplasm. It is of interest that antibodies directed against YscF from Yersinia pestis have recently been shown to protect against bubonic plague in a mouse model, suggesting that needle-forming subunit proteins could also represent therapeutic targets (43Swietnicki W. Powell B.S. Goodin J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 42: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this work, we identify and characterize, for the first time, the macromolecules that participate in T3S needle biogenesis. We show that PscF from P. aeruginosa is able to form robust needle-like structures of different lengths when expressed on its own. Within the bacterial cytoplasm, PscF forms a stable, soluble complex with PscE and PscG in 1:1:1 stoichiometry, thus being trapped in a monomeric state. PscG and PscE are absolutely required for type III secretion and cytotoxicity of P. aeruginosa by influencing intrabacterial PscF levels. Moreover, overproduced PscF cannot be exported and assembled into the needle in PscE- and PscG-deficient mutant strains, suggesting that the formation of the PscE-PscF-PscG complex is required for proper targeting of PscF to the secretion. Circular dichroism melting temperature studies show that, as the number of macromolecules in the complex increases, so does thermodynamic stability, with the ternary PscE-PscF-PscG complex being more stable than its respective components. Thus, in the T3S needle biogenesis mechanism, two distinct macromolecules fulfill roles of preventing premature polymerization of the needle-forming subunit within the cytoplasm and maintaining it in a secretion-prone conformation. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Cytotoxic P. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis isolate CHA (44Dacheux D. Attree I. Schneider C. Toussaint B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6164-6167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the parental strain, and all mutants are isogenic to it. P. aeruginosa strains were grown on Pseudomonas Isolation Agar (Difco) plates or in liquid Luria broth (LB) at 37 °C with agitation. Carbenicillin was used at 500 μg/ml for Pseudomonas Isolation Agar plates and 300 μg/ml in LB. For type III induction, P. aeruginosa overnight cultures were diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (A600) of 0.2 in LB containing 5 mm EGTA and 20 mm MgCl2. Incubation was prolonged for additional 3 h until the cultures reached A600 values of 1.2-1.5. E. coli DH5α cells were used for standard cloning experiments, whereas E. coli BL21(DE3)Star (Invitrogen) was used for overproduction of all His-tagged recombinant proteins. Construction of Expression Vectors—The pscEFGHI part of the exsD-pscBCDEFGHIJKL operon was amplified by standard PCR procedures from CHA genomic DNA and cloned into a TOPO vector (Invitrogen). During this work, we found that PscE contained two amino acid mutations when compared with the P. aeruginosa PAO1 sequence: C40G and H43R (45Stover C.K. Pham X.Q. Erwin A.L. Mizoguchi S.D.

Genes of interest were amplified by PCR with TOPO/EFGHI as a template and subsequently cloned into either pET-15b (Novagen) downstream from a hexahistidine tag, for pscE, pscG, and pscEFGHI, or pET-22b (Novagen) for pscF leading to the Table IS in supplemental material). Expression and Purification of PscE, PscF, PscG, and PscE-PscF-PscG—Protein expression in E. coli BL21(DE3)Star was similar in all cases and was induced in Terrific broth (TB, Difco) with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 m NaCl, 2% glycerol. Supernatants were cleared by centrifugation and applied to a Ni2+-Sepharose column, pre-equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.15, 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2% glycerol (except for PscE, in which 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was employed). Proteins were eluted with a step imidazole gradient and were subsequently eluted from a gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences HR10/60) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. 10 mm dithiothreitol was added to the samples after gel filtration. PscG was subsequently submitted to further purification on a Mono Q column in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA and 5 mm dithiothreitol, being eluted with a NaCl gradient to 0.5 m. Construction of Knock-out Mutants—The CHAΔF strain is described elsewhere (42Pastor A. Chabert J. Louwagie M. Garin J. Attree I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). PscE and PscG knock-out strains (CHAΔE and CHAΔG) were created by exchanging the wild-type copy of the gene by a deleted copy harbored on a non-replicative plasmid. The list of primers and constructed plasmids is provided in supplemental Table IS. The exchange was generated by a double recombination event obtained by negative selection procedure using the sacB gene (46Schweizer H.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1195-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 59Konyecsni W.M. Deretic V. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Selection for double recombination events was achieved by growing co-integrate strains on plates containing 5% sucrose. Carbenicillin-sensitive, sucrose-resistant strains were checked for correct replacement of the wild-type allele by the pscE- and pscG-deleted alleles by PCR and further verified by Southern blotting. All mutants were complemented in trans by a wild-type gene and checked for the restoration of the phenotype to ensure non-polarity of the mutation. All complementations were performed using pIApG in which the gfp cassette was replaced by the gene of interest, thus placing it under the control of the type III promoter ppcrG (pG), as described previously (47Goure J. Pastor A. Faudry E. Chabert J. Dessen A. Attree I. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The construction of pIApG/pscF, which is able to complement the pscF deletion, is described elsewhere (42Pastor A. Chabert J. Louwagie M. Garin J. Attree I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The pscE and pscG genes were recovered from pET-15b/pscE and pET-15b/pscG using NdeI-HindIII digestion and cloned into NdeI-HindIII-digested pIApG. In this case, the ribosome binding site from the gfp cassette that was left in the plasmid is used for the pscE and pscG translation. The his6-pscE and his6-pscG fusions were transferred to P. aeruginosa by introducing XbaI-HindIII fragments from pET-15b/pscE and pET-15b/pscG into pIApG. Type III secretion capacity of all strains was checked systematically in vitro, by triggering the secretion in LB supplemented with 5 mm EGTA and 20 mm MgCl2 and analyzing culture supernatants on SDS-PAGE (48Yahr T.L. Mende-Mueller L.M. Friese M.B. Frank D.W. J Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7165-7168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting Analysis—Cell extracts were obtained from P. aeruginosa cells, which were broken by sonication and ultracentrifuged. Proteins in cleared lysates were resolved on SDS-18% PAGE run in Tris-Tricine buffer and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. For batch purifications, P. aeruginosa-cleared lysates were incubated with Ni2+ beads (HIS-select Nickel Affinity Gel, Sigma). Washing and elution steps were performed as recommended by the supplier. Anti-PscE and anti-PscG antibodies were raised in mouse at HybrIsère (Grenoble, France) using His6-tagged recombinant proteins. Anti-PcrV antibodies and anti-PscF antibodies were raised in rabbits (47Goure J. Pastor A. Faudry E. Chabert J. Dessen A. Attree I. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4741-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).4 Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Sigma). Membranes were developed with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Infection Experiments and Cytotoxicity Assays—All cytotoxicity assays were performed as described previously (49Dacheux D. Goure J. Chabert J. Usson Y. Attree I. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) by using macrophage cell line J774. Cell death was determined with the use of a cytotoxicity detection kit (LDH; Roche Applied Science). Circular Dichroism Measurements—Circular dichroism spectra were measured on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter at 22 °C in a 1-mm cell in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl at protein concentrations of 0.2 mg/ml for all samples. Subsequently, the thermodynamic stability was recorded at 222 nm by monitoring the circular dichroism signal in a range of 4-96 °C with scan rate of 1 °C/min for increasing and decreasing temperature assays. The spectra were corrected against those of the buffer reference. The measured ellipticity was adjusted to the same starting value for all samples for a better visualization of the curves. The equilibrium constant K(T) was determined using the equation K(T) = fU/fF = (yF - y)/(y - yU), where measured ellipticity values (y) were considered as linear combinations of the limit values of the folded state (yF) and of the unfolded state (yU) and y = yF fF + yU fU. The free energy curves were calculated using the equation, ΔG(T) = -RT ln(K(T)), where R is the gas constant (R = 1.987 calories/degree/mole) and T is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin). The melting temperature (Tm) was determined at ΔG(Tm) = 0. Mass Spectrometry—Samples at 1 μm in water/acetonitrile (1/1, v/v) with 0.2% formic acid were infused at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Mass spectra were recorded in the 500- to 1800-m/z range in a Q-TOF Micro mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with an electrospray ion source operated with a needle voltage of 3 kV, with sample cone and extraction cone voltages of 45 and 2 V, respectively. Data were acquired in the positive mode, and calibration was performed using the multiply charged states produced by a separate injection of heart horse myoglobin dissolved in water/acetonitrile (1/1, v/v) with 0.2% formic acid. For native experimentation, sample cone and extraction cone voltages were of 150 and 7 V, respectively. The backing Pirani pressure was set at 4.4 mbar. Mass spectra were recorded in the 2000-6100 mass-to-charge (m/z) range with sample concentrations at 20 μm in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate and continuously infused at a flow rate of 7 μl/min. Data were acquired in the positive mode, and calibration was performed using a solution of 0.5 mg/ml CsI in water/isopropyl alcohol (1/1, v/v). Data were processed with MassLynx 4.0 (Micromass). Electron Microscopy—Samples at a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml were applied to the clean side of carbon on mica (carbon/mica interface) and negatively stained with 1% phosphotungistic acid. A grid was placed on top of the carbon film, which was subsequently air dried. Micrographs were taken under low dose conditions with a Philips CM12 microscope operating at 120 kV and a nominal magnification of 45,000. Two Distinct Molecules Prevent PscF Polymerization within the Bacterial Cytoplasm—PscF is the major T3S needle building block in P. aeruginosa (42Pastor A. Chabert J. Louwagie M. Garin J. Attree I. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and displays 69% sequence identity to YscF, the major T3S needle component of Yersinia sp. (12Hoiczyk E. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4669-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), while harboring only 25% identity to T3S needle monomers of Salmonella and Shigella sp. (PrgI and MxiH, respectively, Fig. 1B). PscF is a naturally self-associating protein, which, when expressed in E. coli and purified by chromatography, elutes as a complex peak in the void volume of an analytical gel filtration column (Fig. 2A). Negative-stained electron microscopy images of samples obtained from the forefront of the void volume peak reveal that PscF forms highly elongated needle-like fibers of >1 μmin length (Fig. 2B), a value that is reminiscent of lengths of needles observed in Shigella strains, which overproduce MxiH (9Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E. Nonaka T. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Kuwae A. Nagai S. Sasakawa C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3876-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or lack a protein controlling needle length (50Magdalena J. Hachani A. Chamekh M. Jouihri N. Gounon P. Blocker A. Allaoui A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3433-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The width of the PscF needle-like structures is ∼8 nm, a value that is in agreement with that for T3S needles isolated directly from different pathogenic species (9Tamano K. Aizawa S. Katayama E.

A. 2001; 98: 4669-4674Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B)). The latter part of the gel-filtration peak contains shorter needle-like structures (Fig. 2C), which may be representative of intermediary forms of the fully polymerized molecule. The high propensity of PscF to generate elongated polymers suggests that, within the bacterial cytoplasm, its polymerization must be blocked by a macromolecular “bodyguard.” To identify this molecule, we overexpressed and purified protein products from a polycistronic expression vector encoding the pscEFGHI section of the exsD-pscBCDEFGHIJKL P. aeruginosa operon (Fig. 1A) in an E. coli system, where the construct introduced a hexahistidine tag to the N terminus of PscE. This experiment yielded three co-purified polypeptides after Ni2+ affinity chromatography and gel filtration, which were identified as His6-PscE (9,326 Da), PscF (9,153 Da), and PscG (12,451 Da) by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Elution of the ternary complex from a gel-filtration column revealed that it migrates much slower than PscF-His6 on its own (Fig. 2A), and its stoichiometry was found to be 1:1:1 by native mass spectrometry, which yielded a molecular mass of 30,933 Da (expected molecular mass 30,930 Da). It is of note that neither PscE nor PscG could rescue polymerized PscF when the proteins were expressed and purified separately, and formation of the soluble 1:1:1 complex required that all three proteins be expressed concomitantly from the same operon (data not shown). This result indicates that PscE and PscG trap PscF in a monomeric state within a ternary complex and thus act as inhibitors of PscF polymerization. To demonstrate the existence of the PscE-PscF-PscG complex in the P. aeruginosa cytoplasm, cell extracts from a cytotoxic, P. aeruginosa wild-type strain (CHA) or PscE and PscG-deficient strains expressing either His6-PscE or His6-PscG, respectively, were batch-incubated with Ni2+ affinity beads. Subsequently, the bound material was washed and eluted. Aliquots of eluted fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies"

Engagement of the BCR triggers signal cascades that lead to the proliferation of the B cells and their differentiation into both long and short lived antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells. The antigen-driven expansion and differentiation of B cells is a carefully balanced process that ensures adequate levels of circulating protective antibody and memory B cells and simultaneously avoids excessive deleterious production of antibody such as occurs in autoimmune diseases. The low affinity inhibitory receptor for IgG, FcγRIIB1, has emerged as a key regulator of B cells responses (3Ravetch J.V. Bolland S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Although B cells express members of the recently identified extended family of FcR homologs these proteins do not appear to bind Fcs and thus do not function as FcRs (4Davis R.S. Ehrhardt G.R.A. Leu C.-M. Hirano M. Cooper M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). During an immune response, once antibody levels reach a critical point resulting in the formation of antigen- and antibody-containing immune complexes (ICs), the simultaneous binding of ICs to the BCR and FcγRIIB1 inhibits BCR signaling. Coligation of the FcγRIIB1 and the BCR by ICs leads to the phosphorylation of the FcγRIIB1 by the Src family kinase Lyn on the tyrosines in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), resulting in the recruitment of the inositol phosphatase, SHIP, which inhibits the BCR trigger Ca2+ mobilization and B cell proliferation (3Ravetch J.V. Bolland S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 275-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization and proliferation appears to proceed through two separable pathways, one requiring the phosphatase activity of SHIP to hydrolyze PI3K-generated phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate preventing Btk and phospholipase Cγ activation (5Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and a second requiring SHIP to recruit the Ras GAP-binding protein p62dok that functions to inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation (6Tamir I.

The physiological significance of the role of the FcγRIIB1 in regulating BCR signaling is demonstrated by the phenotype of FcγRIIB1-deficient mice that show susceptibility to induced autoimmune diseases and to spontaneous autoimmune disease in certain strains (7Bolland S.

In addition to its inhibitory activity when coligated to the BCR, the FcγRIIB1, when aggregated to itself, propagates a signal that leads to apoptosis (8Pearse R.N. Kawabe T. Bolland S. Guinamard R. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1999; 10: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) by an ITIM-independent mechanism that is partially blocked by the coligation to the BCR and the recruitment of SHIP (8Pearse R.N. Kawabe T. Bolland S. Guinamard R. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1999; 10: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, the FcγRIIB1 apparently has the potential to function independently of both ITIM-containing receptors and its own ITIM. The ability of the FcγRIIB to induce apoptosis has the potential to control B cell responses at any point in the antigen-driven proliferation and differentiation pathways of B cells when the FcγRIIB engages ICs independently of the BCR. For example, the ability of the FcγRIIB1 to induce B cell apoptosis has been proposed to play a role in the maintenance of self-tolerance by the elimination of B cells that lose antigen specificity during the process of somatic hypermutation during germinal center expansion (8Pearse R.N. Kawabe T. Bolland S. Guinamard R. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1999; 10: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Indeed, FcγRIIB1-deficient mice on certain genetic backgrounds develop autoantibodies and ultimately die of autoimmune glomerulonephritis (7Bolland S. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 2000; 13: 277-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), suggesting that in the absence of the FcγRIIB1 these mice failed to maintain self-tolerance successfully. Alternatively, the engagement of FcγRIIB expressed on antibody-secreting, long lived plasma cells that no longer express BCR could serve to eliminate these cells once ICs have reached deleterious levels (9Fukuyama H. Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In either case, BCR-independent ligation of the FcγRIIB would play a key role in eliminating potentially harmful antibody responses. Here we show that BCR-independent aggregation of the FcγRIIB1 initiates a novel c-Abl family kinase-dependent, SHIP- and ITIM-independent signaling pathway that results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Although the transforming capacity of v-Abl in pre-B cells and of BCR-Abl in hematopoietic cells, including the majority of B-acute lymphoid leukemias, is well appreciated (10Hantschel O. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 11Wong S. Witte O.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 22: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), a role for the Abl family kinases in normal B cell signaling has been less clearly delineated. The findings presented here describing a role for Abl family kinases in B cell apoptosis may provide further insights into the mechanisms that control both B cell activation and transformation. Reagents and Cell Lines—SHIP (M-14 and P1C1) and polyclonal antibody specific for c-Abl (K-12) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnoloyg (Santa Cruz, CA). FITC-labeled F(ab′)2 goat antibodies specific for mouse or rabbit IgG, FITC-labeled donkey and goat antibodies specific for mouse IgG, 2.4G2, and biotin-2.4G2 mAbs and mAbs specific for c-Abl (8E9) and cytochrome c were purchased from BD Pharmingen. The phosphotyrosine-specific mAb, 4G10, was purchased from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA). Affinity-purified rabbit antibodies specific for phospho-c-Abl (Tyr245) were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Immunocomplexes of peroxidase and rabbit antibodies specific for peroxidase (PAP) were purchased from Sigma. Alternatively, ICs were formed by mixing equal amounts of goat IgG and rabbit antibodies specific for the Fc portion of goat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA) for 30 min at 4 °C.

STI571 (Novartis) tablets were dissolved in water (pH 5.5), and 5 mm stocks were stored at –20 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated and unconjugated whole and F(ab′)2 goat and rabbit antibodies specific for mouse Ig (H+L) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat antibodies specific for rabbit IgG and IgM were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory. M4 mAb was purchased from SouthernBiotech (Birmingham, AL). A20 cell lines have been described previously (12Fong D.C. Brauweiler A. Minskoff S.A. Bruhns P. Tamir I. Mellman I. Daëron M. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4453-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DT40 and mutant cell lines were generated as described previously (5Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells (1–5 × 106) were lysed in cold 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, including 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4 and CLAP (2.5 mg/ml each chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A in dimethyl sulfoxide) for 45 min to 1 h. Lysates were precleared with protein A/G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h, and the cleared lysates were incubated with the specific antibody (2 μg) and protein A or G beads (40 μl 50% slurry) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer or PBS, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and membranes were incubated with blocking solution (5% nonfat milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T wash buffer) containing the specific antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) on x-ray films (Kodak). Cell Cycle Analysis—For cell cycle analyses cells (5 × 105 to 106/ml) were pelleted and resuspended in hypotonic DNA staining solution (30 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20 μg/ml RNase A) for 4–6 h at 4 °C or for 1 h at room temperature and then analyzed with a FACScan (BD Biosciences) to determine the DNA content. The fraction of hypodiploid (apoptotic) cells was determined by gating on the cells below the G1/G0 peak of DNA content. G1/G0 and G2/M populations were determined and quantified using the cell cycle analysis tool of Flowjo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR). Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP) —Cells (1–2 × 105/ml) were incubated in the absence or presence of 50–100 μm STI571 and/or 10μg/ml IC in medium for 4–6 h. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 0.5μg/ml JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, and analyzed by FACS using channel 1 (JC-1/green) and channel 2 (JC-1/red). Dead cells were gated out from the analysis. In dot blots, the left upper quadrant with high red and low or no green fluorescence represents cells with intact MMP, and the remaining three quadrants represent cells with depolarized MMP, which are manifested by reduced red fluorescence and/or increased green fluorescence. Intracellular Staining—For cytochrome c staining, cells (5 × 106/ml) were fixed by treatment with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed and permeabilized by treatment with ice-cold 90% methanol for 30 min on ice. Permeabilized cells were blocked using 50 μg/ml goat IgG in PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 60 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in staining solution (1 × PBS, 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.09% NaN3), and 1 μg of cytochrome c-specific mAb or isotype control antibody was added for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse Ig for an additional 1 h before flow cytometric analysis. For the detection of phospho-c-Abl, intracellular staining was performed according to the directions provided by the manufacturer (Cell Signaling). Cy2- or FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-rabbit Ig was added before flow cytometric analysis. Caspase Assays—Cells (1–2 × 106/ml) were treated with 1 μl of caspase substrates from CaspGLOW fluorescein active caspase staining kits (caspases 3, 8, and 9) (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) and incubated for 45–60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry using the FL-1 channel. TUNEL Assay—A DeadEnd fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells (5 × 106) were fixed by incubation in 5 ml of 1% ice-cold paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 5 ml of 70% ice-cold ethanol and kept at –20 °C overnight. Cells were washed and transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of equilibration buffer for 5 min at room temperature before centrifugation. The nuclei were then incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 50 μl of equilibration buffer containing fluorescein-12-dUTP in the presence of a nucleotides and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase to label 3′-OH termini of the strand breaks of fragmented DNA. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of 20 mm EDTA. After washes and centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of propidium iodide solution (5 μg/ml in PBS, 250 μg of RNase A) for 30 min at room temperature before analysis by FACS for DNA breaks (TUNEL) using FL-1 and DNA content (propidium iodide) using FL-3. Data were analyzed by Flowjo, and contour plots (contour levels: 10% probability) were displayed. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Cells (107) were lysed in cold buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, and CLAP) for 30 min on ice. Cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with c-Abl (8E9)-specific Ab overnight. After washes, immunoprecipitates were incubated with 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing Crk (Upstate) or the cytoplasmic domain of the FcγRIIB1 in a kinase reaction buffer (4 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP) for 30–45 min at 37 °C. SDS sample buffer was added to terminate the reaction before boiling for 5 min. Eluted proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-CrkII (Tyr221, cross-reactive to Tyr207 of Crk) or 4G10 antibody. Alternatively, 5 ng of purified Abl (Cell Signaling) or Arg (Upstate) kinase was incubated with glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of Crk or the FcγRIIB1 cytoplasmic domain in the absence or presence of 10 –100 μm STI571 for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped and analyzed as described above. BCR-independent FcγRIIB1 Aggregation Results in G1 Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis through a Caspase 3- and 9- and Mitochondria-dependent Pathway—To determine the effect of FcγRIIB1 aggregation on cell cycle progression in B cells, DT40 chicken B cells that express the mouse FcγRIIB1, DT(FcγR+), were treated with the biotinylated FcγRIIB1-specific mAb, 2.4G2 (b-2.4G2), and avidin to cross-link the FcγRIIB1, incubated with propidium iodide to label DNA, and the DNA content was determined by flow cytometry. Untreated cells were unsynchronized and distributed in the G1/G0 and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 1A). Cross-linking the FcγRIIB1 resulted in growth arrest and accumulation of cells in the G1/G0 phase. Growth arrest in G1/G0 was dependent on the dose of the b-2.4G2 mAb but was not dependent on a functional ITIM or on the inositol phosphatase, SHIP, because aggregation of the FcγRIIB1 resulted in cell cycle arrest in DT(FcγR+) cells that were deficient in SHIP, DT(FcγR+ SHIP–), or expressed a mutant version of the FcγRIIB1 in which the ITIM tyrosine (residue 309) was mutated to a phenylalanine, DT(FcγR Y309F) (Fig. 1B). Aggregation of the FcγRIIB1 was shown earlier to induce apoptosis in DT(FcγR+) cells as measured by DNA fragmentation (8Pearse R.N. Kawabe T. Bolland S. Guinamard R. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1999; 10: 753-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As indicated either by an increase in hypodiploid cells measured by propidium iodide staining (data not shown) or TUNEL-positive cells, aggregation of the FcγRIIB1 led to apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Apoptosis was most efficiently induced by incubating the DT(FcγR+) cells with ICs (Fig. 1C) rather than the b-2.4G2 mAb and avidin (data not shown) in that within 16 –20 h of treatment with ICs apoptosis was evident, and in contrast, apoptosis induced with b-2.4G2 and avidin was only measurable at 36 h post-treatment. Induction of apoptosis, like induction of G1/G0 growth arrest, was not dependent on either a functional ITIM or on SHIP because aggregation of the FcγRIIB1 on DT(FcγR Y309F) and DT(FcγR+ SHIP–) cells resulted in apoptosis (Fig. 1C). Cells appeared to enter apoptosis from the G1/G0 phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 1D), and this pattern was not dependent on a functional ITIM or on SHIP (data not shown). Concerning the mechanism by which apoptosis is induced, treatment of DT(FcγR+) cells with IC to cross-link the FcγRIIB1 resulted in the induction of the activity of the apoptosis-associated caspases 9 and 3 in ∼25% of the cells (Fig. 2A). The number of caspase-positive cells correlated with the number of cells induced to undergo apoptosis indicated by either the number of hypodiploid cells (data not shown) or TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 1C). Cross-linking the FcγRIIB1 also induced the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria in DT(FcγR+) cells (Fig. 2B). Lastly, FcγRIIB1 aggregation resulted in a Ca2+-dependent depolarization of the mitochondria membrane measured using the membrane-permeable lipophilic cationic fluorochrome, JC-1 (13Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). JC-1 is taken up into mitochondria by the membrane potential where JC-1 aggregation results in red fluorescence. JC-1 does not accumulate in mitochondria in which the membranes have depolarized and remains a monomer in the cytoplasm yielding a green fluorescence. As shown, cross-linking the FcγRIIB1 resulted in a 6-fold increase in green fluorescent cells compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these findings indicate that cross-linking the FcγRIIB1 induces apoptosis through caspase activation, cytochrome c release, and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane. Aggregation of the FcγRIIB1 Results in Its Phosphorylation and Association with c-Abl in an ITIM, SHIP, and Src Family Kinase-independent Mechanism—To delineate the signaling cascade triggered by FcγRIIB1 aggregation which leads to apoptosis we first investigated the phosphorylated state of the FcγRIIB1 following cross-linking. DT(FcγR–) and DT(FcγR+) cells were treated at 4 °C briefly to cross-link the FcγRIIB1 using b-2.4G2 mAb and avidin, warmed to 37 °C, and incubated for 5 min, lysed, and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were immunoprecipitated from the lysates using the phosphotyrosine-specific mAb, 4G10. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting probing for the FcγRIIB1 using rabbit antibodies specific for the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB1. The FcγRIIB1 was tyrosine phosphorylated following aggregation of the FcγRIIB1 by b-2.4G2 mAb and avidin (Fig. 3A), and phosphorylation was dependent on the concentration of the cross-linking mAb, 2.4G2 (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with ICs; however, receptor phosphorylation was not observed when cells were treated with isotype-matched nonspecific mAbs or with monovalent Fab 2.4G2 (data not shown). Moreover, the FcγRIIB1 was not present in immunoprecipitates using isotype control antibodies (data not shown). After coligation of the FcγRIIB1 to the BCR, the FcγRIIB1 has been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated by the Src family kinase, Lyn, on ITIM residues (14Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation of the FcγRIIB1 after BCR-independent aggregation required the ITIM tyrosine residue, DT(FcγR Y309F) cells were treated to cross-link the FcγRIIB1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated FcγRIIB1 was detected as described above. The FcγR Y309F receptor was phosphorylated after FcγRIIB1 cross-linking (Fig. 3A), and the degree of phosphorylation of the wild type and FcγR Y309F appeared similar, suggesting that ITIM tyrosines were not phosphorylated in either the wild type or mutant FcγRIIB1 after aggregation. In addition to the ITIM tyrosine at position 309 the FcγRIIB1 contains three tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain at positions 264, 290, and 326 (12Fong D.C. Brauweiler A. Minskoff S.A. Bruhns P. Tamir I. Mellman I. Daëron M. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4453-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As will be shown below, in mouse A20 cells expressing a truncated form of the FcγRIIB1 which ends at position 289 (FcγRΔ289) the receptor is phosphorylated after BCR-independent aggregation (see Fig. 7), suggesting that tyrosine 264 may be the target of phosphorylation. The FcγRIIB1 was also phosphorylated in DT(FcγR+ SHIP–), and the level of phosphorylation of the FcγRIIB1 appeared similar to that and in DT40(FcγR+ SHIP–) cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting that SHIP is not required for FcγRIIB1 phosphorylation and, moreover, may not regulate the signaling cascade triggered by aggregation of the FcγRIIB1 at the level of receptor phosphorylation. In an attempt to identify the kinase activity responsible for the phosphorylation of the FcγRIIB1, cells were treated with several inhibitors that blocked the activities of known components of B cell signaling pathways including Lyn, Syk, Btk, p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and PI3K. However, none of the inhibitors was effective in blocking FcγRIIB phosphorylation (data not shown), suggesting that the FcγRIIB triggered a novel BCR-independent signaling pathway. Because the Abl family kinases have been implicated in proapoptotic signaling (15Druker B.J. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Ohno S. Segal G.M. Fanning S. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (3117) Google Scholar) they were potential candidates to play a role in FcγRIIB1 phosphorylation. To determine whether c-Abl associated with the FcγRIIB1 following BCR-independent aggregation immunoprecipitates of c-Abl from DT(FcγR+), cells treated to cross-link the FcγRIIB1 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting probing for FcγRIIB1. FcγRIIB1 was present in c-Abl immunoprecipitates from cells in which the FcγRIIB1 was cross-linked and phosphorylated but not from untreated cells (Fig. 3A). The FcγRIIB1 appears as a band in the immunoblots immediately above the band present in all lanes representing the rabbit antibodies used to immunoprecipitate c-Abl. The association of c-Abl with the FcγRIIB1 was dependent on the dose of the b-2.4G2 mAb and was also induced using ICs to aggregate the FcγRIIB1 (data not shown). The association of c-Abl with the phosphorylated FcγRIIB1 was not dependent on the ITIM tyrosine and was not significantly regulated by SHIP and as indicated by the association of c-Abl with the FcγRIIB1 in DT(FcγR Y309F) and DT(FcγR+ SHIP–) cells (Fig. 3A). Using an antibody specific for phosphorylated c-Abl it was possible to show by flow cytometry that aggregation of the FcγRIIB1 resulted in the phosphorylation of c-Abl (Fig. 3B). c-Abl phosphorylation was not dependent on ITIM tyrosine or SHIP because c-Abl was phosphorylated in DT(FcγR Y309F) cells and in DT(FcγR+ SHIP–) cells in which the FcγRIIB1 was cross-linked (Fig. 3B). The Phosphorylation of FcγRIIB1, Its Association with c-Abl, and Induction of Apoptosis Are Dependent on Both c-Abl and Arg Kinase Activities—To determine whether phosphorylation of the FcγRIIB1, its association with c-Abl, and induction of apoptosis were dependent on the activity of the c-Abl, DT(FcγR+) cells were treated with the Abl inhibitor, STI571 (15Druker B.J. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Ohno S. Segal G.M. Fanning S. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (3117) Google Scholar) prior to aggregation of the FcγRIIB1. STI571 blocked both the phosphorylation of the FcγRIIB1 and the association of c-Abl with the FcγRIIB1 in a STI571 dose- and time-dependent fashion (Fig. 4A). The concentration of STI571 required to block FcγRII phosphorylation is similar to that reported by others to block c-Abl function in early pre-B cell lines (16Muljo S.A. Schlissel M.S. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and in thymocytes (17Rosse J.P. Diehn M. Tomlinson M.G. Lin J. Alizadeh A.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Weiss A. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: 271-287Google Scholar). Significantly, blocking c-Abl activity with STI571 blocked the FcγRIIB1-induced apoptosis of B cells as measured by depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 4B). Cross-linking the FcγRIIB1 induced ∼35% of cells to undergo apoptosis, and this number was reduced significantly in a STI571 dose-dependent fashion. To evaluate directly the requirement for c-Abl in FcγRIIB1 signaling for apoptosis, the ability of FcγRIIB1 cross-linking to induce FcγRIIB1 phosphorylation in DT40 cells expressing the FcγRIIB1 in which the c-Abl gene was deleted, DT(FcγR+ Abl–), was tested. FcγRIIB1 clustering-induced phosphorylation was only partially blocked in DT(FcγR+ Abl–) cells (data not shown). Because ST1571 blocked receptor phosphorylation completely in wild type cells this observation suggested that the activity of c-Abl may be partially redundant with that of another c-Abl family kinase. DT40 cells that expressed the FcγRIIB1 and were deficient in both c-Abl and Arg, DT(FcγR+ Abl– Arg–), did not phosphorylate the FcγRIIB1 or undergo apoptosis in response to FcγRIIB1 cross-linking (Fig. 4, C and D). Arg was also detected associated with the FcγRIIB after FcγRIIB1 cross-linking (Fig. 4C). Taken together these results indicate a direct role for the Abl family kinases, c-Abl and Arg, in FcγRIIB-induced apoptosis. The effect of FcγRIIB1 cross-linking on Abl kinase activity was determined. DT(FcγR+) cells were treated to aggregate the FcγRIIB, the cells were lysed, Abl kinases were immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitates were assayed for Abl kinase activity using the Abl substrate Crk.

https://openalex.org/W2060715963,"The endothelial differentiation gene family encodes three highly homologous G protein-coupled receptors for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Based on baculoviral overexpression studies, differences have been proposed in the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of these receptors. We have compared the SAR of the individual receptors either overexpressed transiently at high or at lower levels following stable transfection in LPA-nonresponsive RH7777 cells. The SAR in transfected RH7777 cells was markedly different from that described in insect cells. The LPA3 receptor has been proposed to be selectively activated by unsaturated LPA species and shows a strong preference for sn-2 versus the sn-1 acyl-LPA regioisomer. Because of the short half-life of sn-2 LPA due to acyl migration under some conditions, we have synthesized acyl migration-resistant analogs using an acetyl group in place of the free hydroxyl group in order to evaluate LPA receptor SAR. Only LPA1 and LPA2 showed regioisomeric preference and only for the 18:2 fatty acyl-stabilized LPA sn-1 regioisomer. To identify residues involved in ligand recognition of LPA3, we developed and validated computational models of LPA3 complexes with the analogs studied. The models revealed that Arg-3.28 and Gln-3.29 conserved within the LPA-selective endothelial differentiation gene receptors and the more variable Lys-7.35 and Arg-5.38 of LPA3 form critical interactions with the polar headgroup of LPA. The models identified Leu-2.60 and Val-7.39 of LPA3 underlying the regioisomer-selective interaction with the acetyl group of the stabilized regioisomers. Mutation of Leu-2.60 to alanine selectively increased the EC50 of the sn-2 acetyl-LPA regioisomers, whereas alanine replacement of Val-7.39 profoundly affected both regioisomers.

The radyl-lysoglycerophosphates include several naturally occurring analogs of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) 3The abbreviations used are: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; AGP, alkyl-ether glycerophosphate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; cPA, cyclic phosphatidic acid; EC50, effective concentration for half population; EDG, endothelial differentiation gene; Emax, maximal effect; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PA, phosphatidic acid; PBS; phosphate-buffered saline; RH7777, rat hepatoma cell; SAR; structure-activity relationship; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; TM, transmembrane domain; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. that elicit a multitude of cellular responses through the activation of three G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) of the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family (for reviews, see Refs. 1Ishii I.

Of the eight EDG receptors, five are specific for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), whereas the other three, designated LPA1 (EDG2), LPA2 (EDG4), and LPA3 (EDG7), are specific for LPA and share 49-54% sequence identity. Most cells express multiple LPA receptor subtypes. LPA1 and LPA2 show overlapping and broad tissue distribution, whereas LPA3 is expressed predominantly in the heart, testis, prostate, and pancreas and to lesser extent in the ovary and lung (4Bandoh K.

LPA GPCRs differ in their G-protein coupling; LPA1 couples to Gαi/o and Gα12/13, whereas LPA2 and LPA3 additionally couple to Gαq/11 (1Ishii I. Fukushima N. Ye X. Chun J. Annu. Rev.

Differences in ligand specificity probably introduce another level of signaling specificity. LPA is not a single molecular entity but a collection of endogenous structural analogs ranging from saturated to polyunsaturated fatty esters (6Baker D.L. Desiderio D.M. Miller D.D. Tolley B.

Short chain phosphatidic acids (C2-C8) are agonists of LPA receptors, and dioctylglycerol phosphate and pyrophosphate are competitive antagonists of the LPA1/3 receptors (12Fischer D.J. Nusser N. Virag T. Yokoyama K. Wang D. Baker D.L. Bautista D. Parrill A.L. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 776-784PubMed Google Scholar). The most abundant LPA species in serum contain 20:4 and 18:2 fatty acids, each constituting ∼40% of the ∼10 μm total LPA (6Baker D.L. Desiderio D.M. Miller D.D. Tolley B. Tigyi G.J. Anal.

Because 18:2 and 20:4 fatty acids are esterified predominantly at the sn-2-position of phospholipids, Sano et al. (11Sano T. Baker D. Virag T. Wada A. Yatomi Y. Kobayashi T. Igarashi Y. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21197-21206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) proposed that the bulk of serum LPA is produced through a two-step pathway that involves the production of an sn-2 lyso intermediate by phospholipase A1, followed by lysophospholipase D cleavage of the headgroup. This biochemical pathway involves the nascent production of an unstable sn-2 LPA intermediate that rapidly undergoes acyl migration and yields the more stable sn-1 analog. In the pH range 7-8, the half-life of sn-2 lysophosphatidylcholine is only a few min, and binding to serum albumin does not prolong its stability (13Croset M. Brossard N. Polette A. Lagarde M. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Bandoh et al. (14Bandoh K. Aoki J. Taira A. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Hosono H. Kobayashi S. Kobayashi T. Murakami-Murofushi K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) published the most comprehensive analysis to date of the LPA structure-activity relationship (SAR) using recombinant LPA receptors expressed through baculovirus transduction of Sf9 insect cells. They noted important differences in ligand preferences between the three receptors. These authors reported that LPA3 was unique in that it could only be activated by unsaturated acyl LPA and showed an order of magnitude preference for sn-2-over sn-1-substituted LPA with acyl chain lengths between 16 and 20 carbons. The specificity for unsaturated fatty acyl LPA species has not been confirmed by Im and colleagues (16Im D.S. Heise C.E. Harding M.A. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Theodorescu D. Lynch K.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), who, using a GTPγS binding assay, found that saturated LPA species also activated LPA3 expressed in HEK293T cells. However, HEK293 cells are endogenously responsive to LPA (15An S. Dickens M.A. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. Simpson P.B. Villullas I.R. Schurov I. Kerby J. Millard R. Haldon C. Beer M.S.

Lynch K.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Based on the regiosimeric selectivity, Bandoh et al. (14Bandoh K. Aoki J. Taira A. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Hosono H. Kobayashi S. Kobayashi T. Murakami-Murofushi K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) proposed that nascent sn-2 LPA may function as a selective activator of LPA3. This hypothesis reinforced an earlier observation by Xu et al. (17Xu Y. Fang X.J. Casey G. Mills G.B. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 933-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) that sn-2 LPA was generated by ovarian cancer cells and functioned as a modulator of cancer growth and invasion. These observations that endow sn-2 LPA with unique ligand properties carry inherent pitfalls. First, heterologous expression of mammalian GPCR in Sf9 cells might not represent the pharmacological properties of the same receptor expressed at the endogenous level in mammalian cells. Many factors, including a lack of higher order glycosylation, sulfation, and the impact of spare receptors due to high levels of overexpression, may all play roles in potential discrepancies. Second, insect G proteins do not couple to several mammalian GPCRs, including LPA1 (14Bandoh K. Aoki J. Taira A. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Hosono H. Kobayashi S. Kobayashi T. Murakami-Murofushi K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), unless mammalian G protein subunits are co-expressed. To overcome this problem Bandoh et al. (14Bandoh K. Aoki J. Taira A. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Hosono H. Kobayashi S. Kobayashi T. Murakami-Murofushi K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) did not co-express mammalian G protein subunits but instead produced a receptor chimera by replacing the C-terminal 30 amino acids of LPA1 with the last 53 amino acids of LPA2. The impact of this protein engineering on ligand binding and receptor activation has not been evaluated and may introduce changes in ligand recognition. Thus far, not a single cell type has been found that endogenously expresses LPA3 alone, preventing a verification of its unique SAR. Third, although pH was adjusted to 6.2, which slows acyl migration between the sn-2- and sn-1-positions, time between lipid solution preparation and use was not defined; therefore, regioisomeric composition of the ligand at the time of the assay is unclear. Finally, pKa values of amino acid residues in proteins can have strong environmental dependence, and the effect of pH on ligand recognition in the LPA receptor family has not previously been studied. Our groups have previously examined S1P and LPA recognition of the S1P1, S1P4, and LPA1 EDG family receptors using computational modeling and site-directed mutagenesis (18Parrill A.L. Wang D.-A.

These studies have identified two conserved positively charged residues, Arg-3.28 and Arg/Lys-5.38 in the third and fifth transmembrane domain, respectively, that are required for ligand binding and receptor activation. Additionally, a cationic residue in the seventh transmembrane domain at position 7.34 in S1P1-3, but 7.33 in S1P4, is required for ligand binding and activation of S1P1 but not S1P4. Our previous studies succeeded in pinpointing position 3.29, conserved as glutamine in LPA-specific and glutamate in S1P-specific members of the EDG family, as the single locus that determines ligand specificity for S1P versus LPA (19Wang D.

Pham T.T. Fells J.I. Hutchinson G. Milligan G. Parrill A.L. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although residues involved in phosphate recognition are conserved between LPA1 and LPA3 receptors, differences in the SAR between the two receptors (14Bandoh K. Aoki J. Taira A. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. Hosono H. Kobayashi S. Kobayashi T. Murakami-Murofushi K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that residues positioned lower in the transmembrane domains might be involved in ligand recognition and selectivity. To elucidate the structural foundations of proposed differences in ligand specificity between LPA receptor subtypes, we examined multiple objectives in the present study. First, we compared the SAR of the three LPA receptors expressed in RH7777 rat hepatoma cells transiently (high levels) or stably (low levels). RH7777 cells are devoid of EDG family LPA receptors (5Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and do not produce intracellular Ca2+ transients in response to LPA. Transfection with individual LPA receptors confers robust Ca2+ responses to nanomolar concentrations of LPA in these cells (12Fischer D.J. Nusser N. Virag T. Yokoyama K. Wang D. Baker D.L. Bautista D. Parrill A.L. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 776-784PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we synthesized acyl migration-resistant sn-1 and sn-2 regioisomers of LPA with saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl chains by blocking the free hydroxyl with an acetyl group and evaluated their ligand properties. Third, we validated a previously developed computational model of LPA3 (23Sardar V.M. Bautista D.L. Fischer D.J. Yokoyama K. Nusser N. Virag T. Wang D.A. Baker D.L. Tigyi G. Parrill A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which revealed distinct residues responsible for the polar headgroup interactions and for selective interaction with the acetyl groups of the stabilized sn-1 and sn-2 regioisomers of LPA. Our results obtained from transient and stable transfection of LPA3 in RH7777 cells expressing each of the three LPA GPCRs in solutions buffered at pH 7.4 revealed substantial differences compared with results obtained in Sf9 cells in solutions buffered at pH 6.2 (4Bandoh K.

The individual receptor models were used in docking studies with the LPA, AGP, cPA, and acetyl-LPA species studied experimentally. LPA, AGP, and acetyl-LPA species were modeled with phosphate groups carrying a -2 charge, whereas cPA was modeled with a charge of -1. Docking calculations were performed using the Autodock 3.0 software (28Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput.

The complex chosen as the best geometry from each docking calculation was that with the lowest final docked energy value. Complexes used to select mutations to validate the interactions between receptor and ligand (LPA 18:1; PA 18:1/2:0, and PA 2:0/18:1 in LPA3) were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations using 1-fs time steps for 500 ps. The lowest energy structure sampled at 1-ps intervals during the simulation was geometry-optimized and visually evaluated to predict residues involved in ligand recognition and selectivity. Site-directed Mutagenesis—cDNA encoding human LPA3 (GenBank™ accession number NM012152) subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression plasmid (Invitrogen) was a generous gift from Dr. Junken Aoki (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan).

Cells plated in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 2 μg of DNA using Effectene according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RH7777 cells stably expressing the LPA1 and LPA3 receptors have been characterized elsewhere (12Fischer D.J. Nusser N. Virag T. Yokoyama K. Wang D. Baker D.L. Bautista D. Parrill A.L. Tigyi G. Mol.

RH7777 cells stably expressing LPA2 receptors were a generous gift from Dr. Fumikazu Okajima (Gunma University, Gunma, Japan) and were characterized previously (29Ohta H. Sato K. Murata N. Damirin A.

Stable transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 250 μg/ml G418. Flow Cytometry—Cell surface expression of LPA3 mutants was evaluated by flow cytometry. Cells plated in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 4 μg of DNA using PolyFect (Qiagen). After a 24-h incubation, the cells were trypsinized and washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer consisting of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 3% (w/v) BSA. Cells were then incubated in blocking buffer (PBS, 5% BSA, 5% normal donkey serum) for 30 min. The cells were subsequently washed with FACS buffer three times, incubated with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody in blocking buffer (1:100 dilution) for 1 h, rinsed in FACS buffer three times, and incubated in the dark at 4 °C with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1:1600 dilution) for 30 min. The cells were rinsed three times with FACS buffer and analyzed using an LSR II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Measurement of [Ca2+]i—RH7777 cells transiently transfected with either 2 μg of wild type LPA3 or its site-directed mutants were cultured for 24 h and replated onto poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml)-coated 96-well microplates (Corning Incorporated Life Sciences, Acton, MA) at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well. Stable transfectants were also plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well microplates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and were cultured overnight. After a 6-h serum starvation, cells were loaded with Fura-2/AM in Krebs buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.62 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 6 mm glucose) containing 2% (v/v) pluronic acid at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were rinsed with Krebs buffer and monitored in a FLEXstation (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at excitation wavelengths of 340/380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm for 2 min after the addition of the ligand. Stability of cPA in Aqueous Buffer—Solutions of cPA 18:1, 10 mm in PBS, were incubated for up to 24 h at 37 °C. At various time points, 100-μl samples were collected and spiked with equal molar LPA 18:0 as an internal standard. Phospholipids were extracted using a modification of the Bligh-Dyer extraction protocol in which citrate phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, was used to partition acidic lipids into the organic phase. Use of the buffer was necessary, since the addition of HCl, the classical means for extracting acidic phospholipids, caused significant artifactual hydrolysis of cPA to LPA (data not shown). The organic extracts were dried in vacuo, resuspended in 100 μl of methanol, and analyzed by negative ion liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry via direct infusion into a stream of methanol (0.5 ml min-1). Peak heights for cPA 18:1 (417 m/z) and LPA 18:1 (435 m/z) were normalized to that of the internal standard LPA 18:0 (437 m/z). Our first objective in this study was to evaluate the SAR of the three individual LPA receptors expressed either transiently or stably in RH7777 cells at the typical physiological pH of 7.4. Structures of the LPA analogs used in the present study are shown in Fig. 1. The LPA, AGP, and cPA analogs applied to wild type RH7777 cells did not elicit detectable changes in [Ca2+]i up to 10 μm (supplemental Fig. 1). Initially, we compared the effect of acyl-chain lengths and the degree of unsaturation on ligand properties for seven 1-acyl-LPA analogs using intracellular Ca2+ mobilization for a read-out (Fig. 2). LPA 20:0 failed to activate LPA1 after either transient or stable expression (Fig. 2, A and D). The rank order of the six remaining analogs in cells transiently expressing LPA1 was 18:2 > 18:3 > 20:4 > 18:1 > 16:0 > 18:0 (Fig. 2A). Unexpectedly, the stable LPA1 cells showed a different response when exposed to the seven LPA analogs. We did not find significant differences in the EC50 between 18:2, 18:3, 18:"

SecA exists as a dimer in solution, but the exact oligomeric state of SecA during membrane binding and preprotein translocation is a topic of debate. To study the requirements of oligomeric changes in SecA during protein translocation, a non-dissociable SecA dimer was formed by oxidation of the carboxyl-terminal cysteines. The cross-linked SecA dimer interacts with the SecYEG complex with a similar stoichiometry as non-cross-linked SecA. Cross-linking reversibly disrupts the SecB binding site on SecA. However, in the absence of SecB, the activity of the disulfide-bonded SecA dimer is indistinguishable from wild-type SecA. Moreover, SecYEG binding stabilizes a cold sodium dodecylsulfate-resistant dimeric state of SecA. The results demonstrate that dissociation of the SecA dimer is not an essential feature of the protein translocation reaction.

The SecYEG complex constitutes a membrane-embedded protein-conducting channel (reviewed in Ref. 2Veenendaal A.K.J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). When bound to SecYEG, SecA functions as a high affinity membrane receptor for the molecular chaperone SecB with associated preproteins (3Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The movement of the preprotein through the protein-conducting channel is driven by multiple cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis at SecA (4Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and the proton motive force. In solution, SecA exist as a homodimer (5Akita M. Shinaki A. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that equilibrates with its monomeric form in a temperature-, salt- and protein concentration-dependent manner (6Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, the dissociation constant (KD) for the monomer-dimer equilibrium is ∼0.1 μm (6Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and because the cellular concentration of SecA is ∼8 μm (5Akita M. Shinaki A. Matsuyama S. Mizushima S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), SecA is mostly dimeric in vivo. Because heterodimers formed of active and inactive SecA subunits were shown to be inactive, SecA has been proposed to remain dimeric during preprotein translocation (7Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13190-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). SecA needs to be dimeric to functionally interact with SecB (8Fekkes P. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 9Randall L.L. Crane J.M. Lilly A.A. Liu G. Mao C. Patel C.N. Hardy S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the structural basis for this requirement was recently solved showing an interaction of the homotetrameric SecB protein with two carboxyl-terminal SecB binding domains of SecA (10Zhou J. Xu Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These observations lend strong support for a catalytic role of the SecA dimer during at least the initial preprotein targeting events by SecB and the consecutive preprotein transfer mechanism from SecB to SecA. Nevertheless, the oligomeric state of SecA during preprotein translocation has become a topic of controversy. Bacillus subtilis SecA has been crystallized both as a dimer (11Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and a monomer (12Osborne A.R. Clemons Jr., W.M. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10937-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, various in vitro studies suggest that the oligomeric state of SecA changes upon interaction with its ligands. Negatively charged lipids induce monomerization of SecA (13Or E. Navon A.

Kendall D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Synthetic signal peptides, on the other hand, were found to induce either monomerization (13Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or oligomerization (14Benach J. Chou Y.T. Fak J.J. Itkin A. Nicolae D.D. Smith P.C. Wittrock G. Floyd D.L.

Covalently linked or antibody-stabilized solubilized SecY(EG) dimers were found to associate with either SecA monomers (16Tziatzios C. Schubert D. Lotz M. Gundogan D. Betz H. Schagger H. Haase W. Duong F. Collinson I. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or a mixture of SecA dimers and monomers (17Duong F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), whereas a complex of a preprotein and SecYEG associated with monomeric SecA has been detected on Blue Native PAGE (17Duong F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Together, these observations have led to the proposal that the oligomeric organization of SecA may change during its reaction cycle (14Benach J. Chou Y.T. Fak J.J. Itkin A. Nicolae D.D. Smith P.C.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The requirement for a dimeric state of SecA during translocation was further challenged by studies with SecA mutants that are predominantly monomeric in solution. One of these mutants contained 6 point mutations and a truncation of the carboxyl-terminal 70 amino acids (13Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In another variant, both the amino-terminal 11 amino acids and the carboxyl-terminal 70 amino acids were removed (SecA(Δ2–11)-831) (18Or E. Boyd D. Gon S. Beckwith J. Rapoport T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These monomeric mutants exhibited a very low translocation activity in vitro. The SecA(Δ2–11)-831 mutant was found to partially complement the growth defect of a SecA temperature-sensitive strain. This has led to the suggestion that SecA is functional as a monomer (13Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 18Or E. Boyd D. Gon S. Beckwith J. Rapoport T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent studies with a monomeric SecA mutant carrying a deletion of only the first 11 amino-terminal amino acids (SecA(Δ2–11)) show that this protein is entirely inactive for in vitro preprotein translocation (9Randall L.L. Crane J.M. Lilly A.A. Liu G. Mao C. Patel C.N. Hardy S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Jilaveanu L.B. Zito C.R. Oliver D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Evidently, monomerization of SecA by mutation and/or truncation is associated with a major, if not a complete, loss of the activity. We have studied the functional requirement for the postulated dissociation of the SecA dimer by making use of covalently linked SecA dimers. Although this covalently linked SecA dimer no longer supports SecB-dependent protein translocation, it still binds the SecYEG complex with high affinity and displays normal preprotein-stimulated ATPase and translocation activity in the absence of SecB. These results demonstrate that SecA can bind SecYEG as a functional dimer.

A stock solution of Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 (Sigma) was prepared as described previously (22Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K.J. Driessen A.J.M. van der Does C.

Oxidation of SecA—Prior to the oxidation, SecA (5 μm) was incubated for 30 min on ice in the presence of 2 mm EDTA to remove the zinc ion that stabilizes the carboxyl-terminal SecB binding site. EDTA was removed using a Micro Biospin P-6 column (Bio-Rad), and 0.4 mm Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 was added. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 5 mm neocuproine (Sigma). Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 and neocuproine were removed using a Micro Biospin P-6 column. Surface Plasmon Resonance—SPR measurements were performed on a Biacore 2000 SPR system (Biacore AB) essentially as described (23de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Kloosterman T.G. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29581-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SecA binding to IMVs containing overexpressed SecYEG was measured at 25 °C in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence or absence of 1 mm dithiothreitol. Data were corrected for background binding to IMVs containing wild-type (wt) levels of SecYEG. The data were analyzed using the BIAevaluation 2.2.4 and 3.2 software (Biacore). Other Techniques—Translocation of fluorescently labeled proOmpA was performed as described and visualized in SDS-PAGE gel with a Roche Lumi-imager F1 (Roche Applied Science) (21de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46059-46065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fluorescent and Coomassie-stained bands were quantified with Roche Lumi-analyst 3.1 software. The SecA-stimulated ATPase activity was assayed as described (24Lill R. Cunningham K. Brundage L.A. Ito K. Oliver D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Solubilization of inner membranes at room temperature with SDS and analysis of the monomeric and dimeric forms of SecA by SDS-PAGE were performed as described before (25Spelbrink R.E. Kolkman A.

Oxidation of SecA Results in Intradimeric Cross-links—The carboxyl terminus of E. coli SecA contains 3 cysteine residues that are essential for coordination of a zinc ion and SecB binding (10Zhou J. Xu Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 26Fekkes P. de Wit J.G. Boorsma A. Friesen R.H. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5111-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This region of SecA is not resolved in any of the available crystal structures of full-length SecA (11Hunt J.F. Weinkauf S. Henry L. Fak J.J. McNicholas P. Oliver D.B. Deisenhofer J. Science. 2002; 297: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 12Osborne A.R. Clemons Jr., W.M. Rapoport T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10937-10942Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), but the structure of the carboxyl-terminal SecA peptide in complex with SecB has been reported showing the coordination of the zinc ion by the cysteines and a histidine (10Zhou J. Xu Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies (7Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13190-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) indicate that the carboxyl termini of the two protomers of a SecA dimer are in close proximity. To induce disulfide bridge formation between these cysteines, the zinc ion was removed by incubation with the chelator EDTA, whereupon SecA was oxidized with Cu2+(phenanthroline)3. Under physiological salt conditions, the dissociation constant (KD) for the monomer-dimer equilibrium is ∼0.1 μm (6Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Oxidation was done at a SecA concentration of 5 μm, where the majority of SecA is expected to be dimeric. The cross-linking efficiency was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Up to 80% of SecA could be oxidized into a covalently linked dimer that migrates with an apparent molecular size of ∼200 kDa (cx-SecA) on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Oxidation strictly required the addition of Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 (Fig. 1) and was completely reversed upon the addition of dithiothreitol (data not shown). Oxidation can result in disulfide bridges within a SecA dimer (intradimer) but could also give rise to cross-links between two SecA monomers (inter-monomer) or two different SecA dimers (inter-dimer). A SecA tetramer linked by one inter-dimeric disulfide bridge will dissociate in one SecA dimer and two SecA monomers on SDS-PAGE. To address the nature of thecross-links, oxidation was performed at varying SecA concentrations with a fixed concentration of Cu2+(phenanthroline)3 in the absence or presence of high salt. If the covalently linked dimer resulted from intra-dimeric disulfide bridges, the cross-linking efficiency should not be influenced by the SecA concentration. Analysis of the cross-linking efficiency on SDS-PAGE showed that, in the absence of salt, dimer formation was independent of the SecA concentration used (0.25–5 μm, Fig. 1B), When cross-linking was done in the presence of high salt (500 mm) to shift the dimer-monomer equilibrium toward the monomer (6Woodbury R.L. Hardy S.J. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), cross-linking became less efficient and more dependent on the SecA concentration (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data indicate that, in the absence of high salt, oxidation by Cu2+phenanthroline results predominantly in the formation of intra-dimeric SecA disulfide bridges. Cross-linked SecA Dimers Bind with High Affinity to SecYEG—To test whether the high affinity interaction between SecA and SecYEG is affected by the intra-dimeric cross-link, binding of cx-SecA to the SecYEG complex was assayed by SPR. Binding and dissociation of SecA to IMVs containing overexpressed SecYEG was followed in time, and the kinetic parameters of the SecA-SecYEG interaction were determined after correction for background binding to IMVs with endogenous SecYEG levels (23de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Kloosterman T.G. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29581-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As was observed previously (23de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Kloosterman T.G. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29581-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), dissociation of SecA from the SecYEG complex could be described by a parallel dissociation model (TABLE ONE), but the association phase did not fit to this model (data not shown) (23de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Kloosterman T.G. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29581-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data were fitted to a model assuming a simple single site (A + B ↔ AB) interaction (23de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Kloosterman T.G. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29581-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The specific binding of wt-SecA and cx-SecA both reached saturation at a (dimeric) SecA concentration of 50 nm (data not shown) (23de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Kloosterman T.G. Driessen A.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29581-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The interaction of cx-SecA with the SecYEG complex was comparable with wt-SecA, although the binding kinetics were slower for cx-SecA (TABLE ONE). The SPR response of cx-SecA was comparable with the wt-control (Fig. 2). To exclude that the cx-SecA response was due to the small fraction of non-cross-linked SecA, binding was also monitored for a 5× lower wt-SecA concentration. This concentration corresponds to a maximal possible level of non-cross-linked SecA present in the cx-SecA sample (see also Fig. 1A). At this concentration, a much lower binding level was recorded (Fig. 2), which excludes the possibility that the binding response of cx-SecA is primarily due to the non-cross-linked fraction. SPR measures changes in the refractive index at the IMV-coated sensor chip. Because the SPR response is proportional to the mass bound to the SecYEG complex, these results suggest that the stoichiometry of the SecA-SecYEG interaction is similar for wt-SecA and cx-SecA. If wt-SecA would bind as a monomer or dissociate upon interaction with the SecYEG complex, its binding should result in a lower SPR response as compared with cx-SecA. Likewise, binding of cx-SecA as a “dimer of cross-linked dimers” should result in an increased SPR response compared with wt-SecA. Because the responses of cx-SecA and wt-SecA are in the same range, the SPR data indicate that both SecA proteins associate with the SecYEG complex as dimers.TABLE ONEKinetic constants of the SecA-SecYEG interactionkonkoffkoff1koff2KDm-1 s-1s-1s-1s-1mwt-SecA1.8 ± 0.1×1068.0 ± 0.1×10-36.0 ± 0.2×10-2(37%)5.5 ± 0.3×10-3(63%)4.3 ± 0.1×10-9cx-SecA9.6 ± 0.9×1055.3 ± 1.2×10-35.2 ± 0.3×10-2(25%)3.2 ± 0.9×10-3(75%)5.5 ± 0.8×10-9 Open table in a new tab SecYEG Overexpression Results in an Increased Level of Dimeric SecA— After solubilization of IMVs at room temperature with SDS, membrane-associated SecA migrates on SDS-PAGE as a mixture of monomers and dimers (25Spelbrink R.E. Kolkman A. Slijper M. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28742-28748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because purified SecA solubilized in SDS migrates as a monomer irrespective of the presence or absence of lipids under these conditions, the room temperature SDS-resistant SecA dimer could represent the SecYEG-associated SecA fraction (25Spelbrink R.E. Kolkman A. Slijper M. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28742-28748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). If this is the case, overexpression of SecYEG should result in an increased level of SDS-resistant SecA dimers. IMVs containing endogenous or overexpression levels of SecYEG were solubilized in SDS at room temperature and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Membrane-associated SecA migrated as two bands with apparent molecular masses of ∼100 and ∼200 kDa (Fig. 3). The high molecular mass band was only recognized by antibodies against SecA and its position corresponded to the position of the cross-linked SecA-dimer (25Spelbrink R.E. Kolkman A. Slijper M. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28742-28748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), suggesting that it represents the dimeric form of SecA. Evidently, overexpression of SecYEG results in a dramatic increase in the level of SecA dimers (Fig. 3, lane YEG+), demonstrating that SecYEG stabilizes a dimeric state of SecA that is resistant to room temperature SDS. These data further suggest that the SecYEG-bound state of SecA is dimeric. Cross-linked SecA Dimers Are as Active as Wild-type SecA—The ATPase activity of wt-SecA and cx-SecA was assayed in an in vitro system containing urea-treated IMVs harboring overexpressed SecYEG. Both in the presence or absence of preprotein, the ATPase activity of cx-SecA and non-cross-linked SecA were identical (Fig. 4A). Likewise, cx-SecA and wt-SecA were equally effective in supporting the translocation of fluorescein maleimide-labeled proOmpA(C290S) into IMVs (Fig. 4B) and proteoliposomes reconstituted with purified SecYEG complex (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, their activities were equally enhanced by the prlA mutation I408N in SecY (Fig. 4C). To exclude the possibility that the activity of cx-SecA was caused by the small fraction of non-cross-linked SecA present in the sample, translocation was assayed as a function of the SecA concentration. The preprotein-stimulated ATPase (Fig. 4D) and preprotein translocation (Fig. 4E) activity showed a similar dependence on the concentration of wt-SecA and cx-SecA. This further demonstrates that cx-SecA is as active as the non-cross-linked SecA. Cross-linked SecA Dimers Are Defective in SecB-mediated Protein Translocation—Although biochemical data indicate that the extreme carboxyl terminus is not essential for the activity of SecA per se (27Matsuyama S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 7902-7907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), this region is needed for the functional interaction with SecB (8Fekkes P. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether cross-linking of the SecA carboxyl termini affects the SecB-dependent translocation of proOmpA. With wt-SecA, addition of SecB enhanced the translocation of proOmpA (Fig. 5). In contrast, with cx-SecA, addition of SecB resulted in a slight but reproducible inhibition of the proOmpA translocation (Fig. 5). This effect could be restored after reduction of the carboxyl-terminal disulfide bridges of cx-SecA by the addition of dithiothreitol (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the cross-linking of the carboxyl-terminal cysteines reversibly disturbs the functional SecA-SecB interaction, while it does not affect SecA-dependent preprotein translocation in the absence of SecB. SecA is a motor protein that fulfills a key role in preprotein translocation. It interacts with the SecYEG complex, anionic phospholipids, nucleotides, signal peptides, the mature domain of preproteins, and the molecular chaperone SecB. In vitro studies with purified SecA have shown that SecA forms a dynamic dimer whose monomer-dimer equilibrium is altered upon interaction with some of these ligands (13Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Benach J. Chou Y.T. Fak J.J. Itkin A. Nicolae D.D. Smith P.C. Wittrock G. Floyd D.L. Golsaz C.M. Gierasch L.M. Hunt J.F. J.

Biol. 2003; 332: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This has raised questions about the functional significance of the dimeric state of SecA during protein translocation. In this study, we have analyzed the functional requirement for dimer dissociation by means of a covalently linked SecA dimer. Although the covalently linked SecA dimer was defective in SecB-mediated translocation, its catalytic properties were indistinguishable from wt-SecA in the absence of SecB. These data demonstrate that complete dissociation of the SecA dimer is not an essential feature of the translocation reaction. Covalently linked SecA dimers were obtained by oxidation with Cu2+(phenanthroline)3. This treatment results in disulfide bridge formation between the carboxyl-terminal cysteines of the two protomers of a SecA dimer. Cross-linking of the carboxyl termini alone cannot rule out the possibility that other, non-covalent interactions at the SecA dimer interface dissociate during catalysis or that only one of the protomers of the SecA dimer is actively involved in translocation at a given time. However, the activity of the SecA dimer was previously shown to be abolished upon inactivation of one of its subunits (7Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13190-13197Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Active participation of both protomers thus appears to be required for efficient preprotein translocation. Moreover, the activity of cx-SecA was essentially identical to wt-SecA under conditions where SecA was limiting for translocation. This strongly suggests that the covalently linked dimer acts similarly to the wild-type SecA dimer and does not merely function as a monomer with a non-functional SecA protomer attached to its carboxyl terminus. The carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues of SecA are located in the region that forms the high affinity binding site for SecB (8Fekkes P. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Without the carboxyl-terminal 21 amino acids, SecA no longer binds SecB in a functional manner but is still able to catalyze SecB-independent protein translocation (8Fekkes P. van der Does C. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6105-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 31Fekkes P. de Wit J.G. van der Wolk J.P. Kimsey H.H. Kumamoto C.A. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We now observe that the addition of SecB no longer stimulates, but rather inhibits, preprotein translocation when the SecA dimer is cross-linked via its carboxyl-terminal cysteines. Recently, the structure of the extreme carboxyl terminus of Haemophilus influenzae SecA in association with SecB was solved (10Zhou J. Xu Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In agreement with biochemical studies (26Fekkes P. de Wit J.G. Boorsma A. Friesen R.H. Driessen A.J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5111-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the crystal structure confirmed the presence of a zinc ion coordinated by 3 cysteines and 1 histidine residue (10Zhou J. Xu Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Zinc stabilizes a fold that exposes the basic amino acids of the carboxyl terminus toward the anionic binding surface on SecB. It is therefore likely that oxidation of the cysteines results in a disruption of the SecB binding site. Because efficient transfer of SecB-bound preproteins to SecA requires a functional SecB binding site (31Fekkes P. de Wit J.G. van der Wolk J.P. Kimsey H.H. Kumamoto C.A. Driessen A.J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), this would explain why the oxidized SecA no longer supports SecB-dependent translocation. Crystallographic (10Zhou J. Xu Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 942-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and biochemical (9Randall L.L. Crane J.M. Lilly A.A. Liu G. Mao C. Patel C.N. Hardy S.J. J. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5111-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) studies lend strong support for the hypothesis that tetrameric SecB with bound preprotein associates with dimeric SecA via the two SecA carboxyl termini that embrace the SecB tetramer. Taken together these data point at a critical role of the SecA dimer, at least in the initial stages of SecB-mediated preprotein targeting and the preprotein transfer reaction. Analysis of membrane-associated SecA on SDS-PAGE suggests that there are at least two SecA populations associated with the inner membrane (25Spelbrink R.E. Kolkman A. Slijper M. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28742-28748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). One of the populations corresponds to a stable dimeric form that resists solubilization in room temperature SDS, whereas the other population is either monomeric or dissociates into monomers under the conditions of solubilization. The presence of membrane-associated SecA dimers is consistent with recent cross-linking experiments on IMVs that also identified a significant population of SecA dimers (19Jilaveanu L.B. Zito C.R. Oliver D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, wt-SecA was shown to be trapped in a membrane-bound heterodimer upon overproduction of SecA mutants that stabilize SecA at the membrane (19Jilaveanu L.B. Zito C.R. Oliver D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because the level of room temperature SDS-resistant dimers increased dramatically upon overexpression of SecYEG (this study), these data strongly suggest that the SecYEG-bound state of SecA is dimeric. Or et al. (13Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 18Or E. Boyd D. Gon S. Beckwith J. Rapoport T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) proposed that SecA binds to the SecYEG complex as a monomer, because chemical cross-linking experiments failed to detect SecA dimers in the presence of proteoliposomes containing purified SecYEG. Their failure to detect dimers by means of cross-linking is, however, most likely due to a large fraction of lipid-bound SecA, as the lipid- and SecYEG-bound SecA populations were not separated. Our SPR experiments show that association of wt-SecA or cx-SecA with the SecYEG complex results in comparable SPR responses. This is only possible when these SecA species bind to the SecYEG complex with the same stoichiometry; i.e. as a SecA dimer. We therefore conclude that the dimeric SecA is the native binding partner for the SecYEG complex. The affinity of cx-SecA for SecYEG was comparable with that of wt-SecA, although the kinetics of both the association and dissociation phase were slower. The slower kinetics of cx-SecA may be due to physical constraints caused by the covalent linkage between the SecA carboxyl termini. In our SPR experiments wild-type SecA does not dissociate from the SecYEG complex according to a simple one-to-one model. Instead, there are two SecA populations that dissociate at different rates. The covalently linked SecA dimer dissociates according to the same model, but the contribution of the slow dissociating population is larger than for wild-type SecA. The mechanism that underlies the parallel dissociation has not been firmly established yet. It is possible that SecA is able to dissociate from the SecYEG complex either as a dimer or as individual monomers. If the dissociation of a SecA monomer is faster than the dissociation of a SecA dimer, this could provide an explanation for the parallel dissociation model as well as for the observation that the cx-SecA dissociates slower from the SecYEG complex than wt-SecA. Future studies should give more insight into the physiological relevance of the parallel dissociation model. Because both the translocation and the ATPase activity of cx-SecA were indistinguishable from wt-SecA, it appears that the kinetics of SecYEG binding are not rate-determining for the translocation reaction. Blue Native Page analysis indicated that a preprotein is associated with at least the monomeric SecA and SecYEG complex during translocation (17Duong F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4375-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be ruled out that the preprotein-translocase complex partly dissociated during membrane solubilization and isolation of the complex. In this respect, co-immunoprecipitation, cross-linking, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicate that the detergent used in the Blue Native Page study, dodecylmaltoside, dissociates the SecA dimer (13Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although analytical ultracentrifugation suggests that dodecylmaltoside does not interfere with SecA dimerization (14Benach J. Chou Y.T. Fak J.J. Itkin A. Nicolae D.D. Smith P.C. Wittrock G. Floyd D.L. Golsaz C.M. Gierasch L.M. Hunt J.F. J. Biol.

SecA variants that are predominantly monomeric due to deletion of the amino-terminal 11 amino acids (18Or E. Boyd D. Gon S. Beckwith J. Rapoport T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or multiple mutations in combination with a truncation of the carboxyl-terminal domain (13Or E. Navon A. Rapoport T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4470-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) were found to display translocation activity, but their activity was dramatically reduced as compared with wild-type SecA. To convincingly detect the activity of these monomeric SecA proteins, the authors employed the PrlA4 mutant of SecY in their assays. This mutant already shows a marked elevated activity with wt-SecA (32de Keyzer J. van der Does C. Swaving J. Driessen A.J.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 510: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 33van der Wolk J.P. Fekkes P. Boorsma A. Huie J.L. Silhavy T.J. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which implies that the SecA monomers will be essentially inactive for preprotein translocation with the wild-type SecYEG complex. Recent investigations with monomeric SecA variants similar to the ones used by Or et al. (18Or E. Boyd D. Gon S. Beckwith J. Rapoport T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9097-9105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) demonstrate that, even though they are able to interact with the SecYEG complex (19Jilaveanu L.B. Zito C.R. Oliver D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), these monomers are completely inactive for translocation activity (9Randall L.L. Crane J.M. Lilly A.A. Liu G. Mao C. Patel C.N. Hardy S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 348: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Jilaveanu L.B. Zito C.R. Oliver D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 7511-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a SecA variant that lacks the 9 amino- and 40 carboxyl-terminal residues is fully active and dimeric, whereas further truncation of the amino terminus yielded unstable SecA mutants unsuitable for further analysis (34Karamanou S. Sianidis G. Gouridis G. Pozidis C. Papanikolau Y. Papanikou E. Economou A. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data lend strong support for the notion that the monomer does not represent a physiologically active state of SecA and support the hypothesis that the SecA dimer is the active species. So far, the oligomeric state of SecA has been addressed mainly in solution or in studies using (truncated) SecA mutants with reduced activity. We have re-investigated the catalytic role of the SecA dimer under conditions where it is actively involved in preprotein translocation. Stabilization of the SecA dimer by cross-linking of the carboxyl-terminal cysteine residues had no effect on the translocation activity under conditions that SecA was limiting for translocation. This strongly suggests that SecA is dimeric in its physiologically active state. Furthermore, our data show that complete dissociation of the SecA dimer is not a critical feature of the catalytic cycle and that SecA binds to the SecYEG complex as a dimer. Further studies should address the question of how the two protomers mechanistically participate in preprotein translocation."

The Nod2 1007fs (Nod2fs) frameshift mutation is the most prevalent in Crohn disease patients. Muramyl dipeptide from bacterial peptidoglycan is the minimal motif detected by Nod2 but not by Nod2fs. Here we investigated the response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Crohn disease patients not only to muramyl dipeptide but also to several other muramyl peptides. Most unexpectedly, we observed that patients homozygous for the Nod2fs mutation were totally unresponsive to MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid (DAP) (M-TriDAP), the specific agonist of Nod1, and to Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan. In contrast, PBMCs from a patient homozygous for the Nod2 R702W mutation, also associated with Crohn disease, displayed normal response to Gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan. In addition, the blockage of the Nod1/M-TriDAP pathway could be partially overcome by co-stimulation with the Toll-like receptors agonists lipoteichoic acid or lipopolysaccharide. Investigation into the mechanism of this finding revealed that Nod2fs did not act as a dominant-negative molecule for the Nod1/M-TriDAP pathway, implying that the blockage is dependent upon the expression or activity of other factors. We demonstrated that PBMCs from Nod2fs patients express high levels of the peptidoglycan recognition protein S, a secreted protein known to interact with muramyl peptides. We proposed that through a scavenger function, peptidoglycan recognition protein S may dampen M-TriDAP-dependent responses in Nod2fs patients. Together, our results identified a cross-talk between the Nod1 and Nod2 pathways and suggested that down-regulation of Nod1/M-TriDAP pathway may be associated with Crohn disease.

Crohn disease is an inflammatory disorder affecting the digestive tract, the etiology of which remains largely unknown. However, the recent association between the disease and Nod2 on the one hand and between Nod2 and bacterial sensing on the other hand suggests that Crohn disease is likely a consequence of a breakdown in tolerance to the intestinal bacterial flora. Still, it remains unclear why Nod2 dysfunction is a risk factor favoring the onset of Crohn disease. Indeed, although Nod2fs is fully defective for peptidoglycan sensing, other Nod2 mutant proteins found in Crohn disease patients display only minor differences in peptidoglycan detection (10Chamaillard M.

It is still unclear why Nod2fs mutation seems to represent a loss-of-function in humans and a gain-of-function in the mouse model. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the response of primary mononuclear cells isolated from Crohn disease patients not only to MDP but also to several muramyl peptides or peptidoglycan agonists. Most surprisingly, we observed that M-TriDAP, the specific agonist of Nod1, failed to induce cytokine response in PBMCs from Nod2fs patients, although it stimulated cells efficiently from either healthy donors or non-Nod2 Crohn disease patients. The importance of this result is further reinforced by the observation that cells from Nod2fs patients were totally unresponsive to peptidoglycan from Helicobacter pylori, which is an efficient activator of both Nod1 and Nod2 signaling pathways. Because Nod2fs was unable to act directly as a dominant-negative molecule for the Nod1 pathway, our results rather suggest that the blockage relies on additional factors expressed in Nod2fs cells. Accordingly, we provide evidence that PBMCs from Nod2fs patients express significantly higher levels of peptidoglycan recognition protein S (PGRP-S) than cells from healthy donors. We propose that PGRP-S expression contributes to the down-regulation of Nod1-dependent responses in Crohn disease patients with Nod2fs mutation. Therefore, these observations suggest the existence of an unexpected cross-talk between the Nod1 and Nod2 signaling pathways. Moreover, our results imply that defects in Nod1 function could participate in the development of Crohn disease. Together, this study provides a basis for the design of original therapeutic approaches for Crohn disease, aiming at establishing a functional Nod1 pathway in Nod2fs patients. Preparation of Highly Purified Peptidoglycans from Gram-negative and Gram-positive Bacteria—Bacterial strains used to prepare peptidoglycans are the following: H. pylori 26695; Staphylococcus aureus COL (from Olivier Chesneau, Institut Pasteur); and Streptococcus pneumoniae R800. The peptidoglycans purification procedures were exactly as described previously (6Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Carneiro L.A. Antignac A. Jehanno M. Viala J. Tedin K. Taha M.K. Labigne A. Zahringer U.

Purity of samples was assessed by HPLC amino acid and saccharide analysis after HCl hydrolysis. Also, each peptidoglycan preparation was tested for the absence of LPS contamination using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay as described previously (21Travassos L.H. Girardin S.E. Philpott D.J. Blanot D. Nahori M.A. Werts C. Boneca I.G. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1000-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The absence of TLR2-detected contaminants (lipoproteins or lipoteichoic acids) was tested on thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages from either C57Bl6 or TLR2–/– mice as described previously (21Travassos L.H.

Preparation of Muropeptides—DAP- and Lys-containing UDP-Mur-NAc-peptides were prepared as described previously (4Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Herve M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J.

Biochem. 1981; 114: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). M-TetraLYS, M-TriLYS, and M-TriDAP were generated by mild acid hydrolysis (0.1 m HCl, 10 min at 100 °C) of the corresponding UDP-MurNAc peptides. Replacement of meso-DAP by l-Lys in the peptidoglycan of Escherichia coli was obtained by overexpression in the latter species of the murE gene from S. aureus encoding UDP-MurNAc-l-Ala-d-Glu:l-Lys adding enzyme (23Mengin-Lecreulx D. Falla T. Blanot D. van Heijenoort J. Adams D.J. Chopra I. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5909-5914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested before cell lysis occurred, and their peptidoglycan was extracted and purified as described previously (24Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 208-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these conditions, about 50% of the DAP residues at the third position of the peptides was shown to be replaced by l-Lys. This peptidoglycan preparation was digested by SltY lytic transglycosylase in a reaction mixture (1 ml) consisting of 300 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 1 mg of PG (briefly sonicated for homogenization), and 100 μgof purified SltY enzyme (25Stenbak C.R.

After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.45 (HPLC eluent A), and 2 μl of phosphoric acid. The two main monomer products, Anh-GM-TetraDAP and Anh-GM-TetraLYS, were purified by HPLC on a column of nucleosyl 5C18 (4,6 × 250 mm, Alltech). Elution was performed at 0.6 ml/min with buffer A, using a gradient of methanol from 0 to 25% for 180 min. Detection was at 215 nm. The retention times of these two compounds were 67 and 80 min, respectively. They were further purified and desalted using a second HPLC step on the same column but this time using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and a gradient of methanol for elution. Their purity and composition were confirmed by amino acid and hexosamine analysis after acid hydrolysis of samples (6 m HCl, 16 h at 95 °C), using an Hitachi L8800 analyzer, as well as by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Anh-M-TetraLYS was obtained by treatment of Anh-GM-TetraLYS with E. coli NagZ β N-acetylglucosaminidase. The reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm substrate, and 20 μg of purified NagZ enzyme (25Stenbak C.R. Ryu J.H. Leulier F. Pili-Floury S. Parquet C.

Anh-GM-TriLYS and Anh-M-TriLYS were generated by treatment of the corresponding tetrapeptide compounds with E. coli LdcA ld-carboxypeptidase. The reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm substrate, and 20 μg of purified LdcA enzyme (25Stenbak C.R. Ryu J.H. Leulier F. Pili-Floury S. Parquet C. Herve M.

In all cases, incubation was for overnight at 37 °C, and the products were purified by HPLC, and their identity was confirmed by the above described procedures. Cell Lines and Reagents—HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to transfection, HEK293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml as described previously (26Girardin S.E. Tournebize R. Mavris M. Page A.L. Li X. Stark G.R. Bertin J. DiStefano P.S. Yaniv M. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). MDP LD (l-alanine d-glutamine) was from Calbiochem and reported to be 98% pure by TLC. Highly purified E. coli LPS (strain O55:B5) was from Invitrogen. Artificially synthesized LTA was kindly provided by Dr. Corinna Hermann (Konstanz University, Germany). Anti-Nod2 rabbit polyclonal antibody was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Harbor, MI), and anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. Expression Plasmids and Transient Transfections—The expression plasmids for Nod1 and Nod2 were the kind gift from Gabriel Nuñez (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI) and have been described previously (27Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The expression vector for Nod2fs was from M. Giovannini (INSERM U674, CEPH, Paris, France). Constructs for Rip2 and MyD88 were kind gifts from M. Thome (ISREC, Lausanne, Switzerland) and M. Muzio (Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy), respectively. The NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid was from Stratagene. Transfections and Western blotting experiments were carried out in HEK293T cells as described previously (26Girardin S.E. Tournebize R. Mavris M. Page A.L. Li X. Stark G.R. Bertin J. DiStefano P.S. Yaniv M. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). NF-κB Activation Assays—Studies examining the synergistic activation of NF-κB by muramyl peptides in cells overexpressing Nod2 were carried out as originally described by Inohara et al. (27Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected overnight with the expression vectors of interest plus 75 ng of NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid. At the same time, muramyl peptides were added to the cell culture medium, and the synergistic NF-κB-dependent luciferase activation was then measured following 24 h of co-incubation. NF-κB-dependent luciferase assays were performed in duplicate, and the data represent at least three independent experiments. Data show means ± S.E. Genotyping of NOD2 Variants—Blood was collected from 74 patients with Crohn disease and 10 healthy volunteers. PCR amplification of NOD2 gene fragments containing the polymorphic sites 3020insC (for Nod2fs) and C2104T (for R702W) was performed in 50-μl reaction volumes containing 100–200 ng of genomic DNA, as described previously (17Netea M.G. Kullberg B.J. de Jong D.J. Franke B. Sprong T. Naber T.H. Drenth J.P. Van der Meer J.W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2052-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The 3020insC polymorphism was analyzed by Genescan analysis on an ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel, The Netherlands). Four patients with Crohn disease were found homozygous for the 3020insC mutation; one patient with Crohn disease was found homozygous for the C2104T mutation, and they were further investigated in the cytokine studies. As control groups, five patients with Crohn disease heterozygous for the 3020 insC NOD2 mutation, five patients with Crohn disease bearing the wild type allele, and five healthy volunteers homozygous for the wild type NOD2 allele were included. The cells isolated from the four groups of patients were isolated and tested at two separate occasions. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Isolation of Mononuclear Cells and Stimulation of Cytokine Production—After informed consent, venous blood was drawn from the cubital vein of patients and healthy volunteers into three 10-ml EDTA tubes (Monoject, s-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands). The PBMC fraction was obtained by density centrifugation of blood diluted 1:1 in pyrogen-free saline over Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were washed twice in saline and suspended in culture medium (RPMI 1640 DM) supplemented with 10 μg/ml gentamicin, 10 mml-glutamine, and 10 mm pyruvate. The cells were counted in a Coulter counter (Coulter Electronics, Mijdrecht, The Netherlands), and the number was adjusted to 5 × 106 cells/ml. 5 × 105 PBMCs in a 100-μl volume were added to round-bottom 96-well plates (Greiner, Alphen aan den Rijn, The Netherlands) and were incubated with either 100 μl of culture medium (negative control) or the following various stimuli: 50 nm of the various muropeptide preparations, 10 μg/ml of the purified peptidoglycans, 100 ng/ml highly purified E. coli LPS (strain O55:B5), 5 μg/ml of artificially synthesized LTA (kindly provided by Dr. Corinna Hermann, Konstanz University, Germany), or a combination of stimuli as described under “Results and Discussion.” Cytokine Measurements—For detection of cytokine concentrations in the supernatants, BioPlex 100 system (Bio-Rad) was used. The kits were used as indicated by the manufacturer, and the sensitivity for all cytokines was <20 pg/ml. Real Time PCR Studies—Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNeasy kits (Macherey Nagel, Hoerdt, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quantification was performed using spectrophotometry. After treatment at 37 °C for 30 min with 20–50 units of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Diagnostics), oligo(dT) primers (Roche Diagnostics) were used to synthesize single-stranded cDNA. mRNAs were quantified using SYBR green master mix (Applera, Courtaboeuf, France) with specific human oligonucleotides in a GeneAmp Abiprism 7000 (Applera, Courtaboeuf, France). The following primers were used: Nod1, sense GTAAAGGTGCTAAGCGAAGA and antisense TCTGATTCTGGATAAGCCAT; hPepT1, sense CCGCCTCCCAGGTTCAA and antisense GGTGCATGCCGCTAATCC; PGRP-S, sense GCAGCACTACCACATGAAGACACT and antisense GAGCCCGTCTTCTCCAATCA; PGRP-L, sense ACTGAGGGCTGCTGGGACCA and antisense GGCCTCAGTGAATTCCTTGG; Rip2, sense AAATGGATCATTAAATGAACTCCTACATAG and antisense TTCATGCAGGATGCGAAATC. In each assay, calibrated and no-template controls were included. Each sample was run in duplicate. SYBR green dye intensity was analyzed using the Abiprism 7000 SDS software (Applera, Courtaboeuf, France). All results were normalized to the β-actin, an unaffected housekeeping gene. Statistical Analysis—The human experiments were performed in triplicate with blood obtained from patients and volunteers. The differences between groups were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test and where appropriate by the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance test. The level of significance between groups was set at p < 0.05. The data are given as means ± S.E. In the search for MDP-derived muramyl peptides that could stimulate the Nod2 signaling pathway, we generated several molecules differing in the length of their peptidic moiety, including M-TriLys and M-TetraLys (Fig. 1A). These molecules were then tested for their ability to activate Nod2 by using co-transfection assays in HEK293T epithelial cells and measuring NF-κB activity as a read-out (Fig. 1B). By using such tests, we reported previously that the activation of Nod2 was maximal with the addition of 10 pmol of MDP/ml of culture medium (leading to a concentration of 10 nm) (4Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Herve M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41702-41708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Here a larger range of muramyl peptide concentration was used (10–250 nm) to allow for the identification of even weak inducers of the Nod2 pathway. Through this approach, we observed that MDP and M-TriLys activated Nod2 with similar efficiency, whereas M-TetraLys represented a poor agonist (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with our previous observations showing that the length of the muramyl peptide stem peptide is a key requirement for induction of Nod2 (4Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Herve M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41702-41708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Because our goal was to use MDP-derived muramyl peptides to stimulate primary human PBMCs (see below), we searched for other MDP-derived molecules that could represent the optimal negative controls for M-TriLys and M-TetraLys agonists. We took advantage of our previous observation that the sugar moiety of muramyl peptides also plays a key role for optimal activation of Nod2 (4Girardin S.E. Travassos L.H. Herve M. Blanot D. Boneca I.G. Philpott D.J. Sansonetti P.J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41702-41708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). We generated modified forms of M-TriLys and M-TetraLys in which the MurNAc moiety is dehydrated to form anhydro-muramyl peptides (see Fig. 1A), and we observed that this subtle modification was sufficient to abolish stimulation of Nod2 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, anhydro-M-TriLys and anhydro-M-TetraLys were subsequently used as control inactive muramyl peptides for M-TriLys and M-TetraLys, respectively. Finally, M-TriDAP, the specific muramyl peptide agonist of Nod1, failed to activate Nod2, even at the highest dose (250 nm) used. The six muramyl peptides characterized above (MDP, M-TriLys, M-TetraLys, anhydro-M-TriLys, anhydro-M-TetraLys, and M-TriDAP) were used to stimulate PBMCs obtained from human blood. PBMCs from three groups of individuals were collected: healthy donors (control, CTR), Crohn disease patients without Nod2 mutations (Crohn), and Crohn disease patients carrying homozygous Nod2fs frameshift mutation (Nod2fs). Muramyl peptides were directly added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 50 nm, and supernatants were collected following overnight stimulation. IL-1β, IL-10, and TNFα were measured in the supernatant, whereas intracellular IL-1α was measured from cell lysates (Fig. 2A). First, our results identified MDP and M-TriLys as potent activators of human PBMC responses, and we confirmed that the detection of these muramyl peptides depends upon Nod2 because Nod2fs cells were not stimulated by MDP and M-TriLys (Fig. 2A). In addition, our observation that M-TetraLys was a poor inducer of Nod2 in vitro was reinforced by our findings that this agonist only marginally induced cytokine secretion from human PBMCs, and that this effect was further blunted in cells from Nod2fs patients (Fig. 2A). More importantly, our results showed that Nod2-independent Crohn disease patients still reacted to MDP and M-TriLys, thus demonstrating that the inability of cells from Nod2fs patients to detect these agonists resulted from their Nod2 mutation and was not an indirect consequence of the disease. Consequently, this observation also suggested that defects in muramyl peptide sensing is not the sole cause of Crohn disease development. Second, the conclusion that sensing of M-TriLys in PBMCs from healthy donors and non-Nod2 Crohn disease patie"

Do the very different roles for these evolutionarily related motors translate into differences in how they generate movement? We have addressed this question by examining when in the ATPase cycle the Eg5 motor domain and neck linker move through the use of a series of novel spectroscopic probes utilizing fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and we have compared our results to kinesin I. Our results are consistent with a model in which movement in Eg5 occurs in two sequential steps, an ATP-dependent docking of the neck linker, followed by a rotation or “rolling” of the entire motor domain on the microtubule surface that occurs with ATP hydrolysis. These two forms of movement are consistent with the functions of a motor designed to generate sustained opposing force, and hence, our findings support the argument that the mechanochemical features of a molecular motor are shaped more by the demands placed on it than by its particular family of origin.

Studies of both myosins and kinesins have revealed a variety of conserved structural elements that play key roles in mechanochemical transduction. These include switch I, switch II, and the P loop located within the catalytic site (3Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar, 5Kull F.J.

Movements of these elements during ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release lead to a series of conformational changes that are transmitted ultimately to the “business end” of the motor, the mechanical element that produces force and movement. In kinesin I, this mechanical element consists of an extended peptide sequence with variable conformation and flexibility, called the “neck linker” (2Vale R.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 3Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic and kinetic studies have led to a convincing model in which the neck linker assumes a random coil in the absence of nucleotide. ATP binding to the active site causes the neck linker to dock along a hydrophobic surface in the motor (7Rice S. Cui Y. Sindelar C. Naber N. Matuska M. Vale R. Cooke R. Biophys.

This process, which is very rapid (>800 s-1) at room temperature, immobilizes the neck linker and effectively “throws” the tethered head of a kinesin dimer forward, toward the next tubulin-docking site (11Rosenfeld S.S.

Variable flexibility and ATP-induced docking are features of the kinesin I neck linker that are well suited to the physiologic role of this motor as a transport engine. Variable flexibility in the neck linker of the tethered head allows it to undergo a diffusive search for the next microtubule-docking site, whereas ATP-induced docking of the neck linker of the attached head helps position the tethered head in a forward position and reduces the probability of backward stepping (10Rice S.

Thus, the physiologic requirements placed on a transport motor like kinesin I translate into structural features of its mechanical element that subserve this function. What about other motors that serve other functions? Do they utilize the same mechanism to generate forward stepping? To address this question, we have turned our attention to another member of the kinesin superfamily, one that serves functions other than vesicle transport. Eg5 is a plus-end directed member of the kinesin 5 subfamily, which localizes to interpolar spindle microtubules and to the spindle poles, and is required for normal spindle function (17Kapitein L.C.

Unlike kinesin I, which moves vesicles along microtubule tracks, Eg5 moves the microtubules themselves. It accomplishes this through its formation of bipolar homotetramers that cross-link microtubules and induce microtubule-microtubule sliding and pivoting (17Kapitein L.C. Peterman E.J. Kwok B.H.

Despite the fact that kinesin and Eg5 subserve different cellular functions and physiologies, they share several important features. First, they share important structural elements. Their primary structures are 40% identical (23Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Like other members of the kinesin superfamily, Eg5 contains several key motor elements, including switch I, switch II, the P loop, and the neck linker. Furthermore, the β sheets that form the core of the motor domains are nearly identical (23Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol.

Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, there are also significant differences between these two motors. The most striking of these is in the position of the neck linker in crystallographic models in the presence of ADP. In the ADP-bound state, the kinesin neck linker is disordered and undocked (8Sindelar C.V. Budny M.J. Rice S. Naber N. Fletterick R. Cooke R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 9: 844-848Google Scholar, 9Case R.B. Rice S. Hart C.L. Ly B. Vale R.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 157-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Rice S. Lin A.W.

Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), whereas in Eg5, it is ordered, and projects perpendicularly from the long axis of the motor core (23Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It has been argued that for a motor that functions in ensembles to slide microtubules, flexibility in the neck linker would be counter-productive. Instead, what would be required would be preservation of neck linker structure in the presence of both ATP and ADP, so that Eg5 could act instead like a “ratchet” (23Turner J. Anderson R. Guo J. Beraud C. Fletterick R. Sakowicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25496-25502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In our previous studies on kinesin I, we utilized a set of novel spectroscopic techniques to monitor the timing of neck linker and motor domain movements during the ATPase cycle (11Rosenfeld S.S.

These studies demonstrated that neck linker docking is rapid, occurs after an ATP-induced conformational change and before hydrolysis, and leads to separation of the two neck linkers of a dimeric kinesin motor. Furthermore, we developed a model in which the timing of these state changes in the neck linker was a key component in the allosteric communication mechanism used by kinesin to maintain its processive movement (11Rosenfeld S.S.

In this study, we have utilized a similar spectroscopic approach to monitor the timing and direction of neck linker and motor domain movements in Eg5. Our results suggest that the different physiologic roles played by Eg5 and kinesin I translate into differences in the way they generate movement. Materials—Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Media components were obtained from Difco. Protease inhibitors, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and reagents for buffers and agarose gel electrophoresis were obtained from Sigma. Ribonuclease A and deoxyribonuclease I were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Pre-packed Sephadex G-25 columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was obtained from Qiagen Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). Fluorescent probes were purchased from Molecular Probes. Synthesis and purification of 2′-deoxy-mant-ATP, 2′-deoxy-mant-ADP, and mant-GTP from N-methylisatoic anhydride and the corresponding nucleotides were carried out as described (26Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Generation of Cysteine-light Eg5 367 Mutants—Our starting material for these studies was a plasmid encoding the amino-terminal 367 residues of human Eg5, followed by a His6 tag for affinity purification (Eg5-367), kindly provided by Drs. Zoltan Maliga and Timothy Mitchison (Harvard Medical School). This plasmid encodes a construct that contains four cysteine residues at positions 25, 43, 87, and 99 (27Maliga Z. Kapoor T.M. Mitchison T.J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, we determined that all four residues were reactive with the fluorescent probe 1,5-IAEDANS 2The abbreviations used are: 1,5-IAEDANS5-((((2-iodoacetyl)amino)ethyl)amino)-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid2′dmD2′-deoxy, 3′-mant-ADP2′dmT2′-deoxy, 3′-mant ATPFRETfluorescence resonance energy transferR0Förster critical energy transfer distanceAEDANSacetylamidoethyl-1-aminonaphthalene-5-sulfonatemant2′,3′-bis(O)-(N-methylanthranolol)dansyl5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylAMPPNPadenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate. (data not shown). Furthermore, for several of the studies described in this work, we wished to perform fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between microtubule tryptophans and an AEDANS probe on the Eg5 neck linker. We therefore generated a cysteine-light Eg5 construct with a reactive cysteine within the neck linker and with the single tryptophan converted to phenylalanine. This was accomplished by utilizing the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) starting with the Eg5-367 plasmid in the pRSET vector (Invitrogen). The following mutations were generated within the construct: cysteine 25 to valine, cysteine 43 to serine, cysteine 87 to alanine, cysteine 99 to alanine, tryptophan 127 to phenylalanine, and valine 365 to cysteine. The resulting construct, CLM-W127F, was verified by sequence analysis. For several of the experiments described in this study, we also created a revertant, CLM construct containing the tryptophan at position 127. The mutated plasmid was transformed into XL1-Blue Escherichia coli. Transformant selection, growth, induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and preparation of the induced Eg5 mutants were carried out as described in our earlier studies of kinesin mutants (11Rosenfeld S.S.

Kinetic Measurements—Transient kinetic measurements were made in an Applied Photophysics SX.18 MV stopped-flow spectrometer with an instrument dead time of 1.2 ms. Complexes of Eg5 and microtubules were formed by mixing the two with a slight excess of microtubules and incubating with apyrase as described in our prior studies of kinesin I (11Rosenfeld S.S.

Dansyl and mant nucleotide fluorescence was excited at 295 nm (for tryptophan energy transfer), and the emission was monitored through a 455-nm cut-off filter (Omega Optical Inc.). For experiments with mant-ADP as donor and Oregon Green 488 as acceptor, the mant fluorophor was excited at 356 nm, and the Oregon Green emission was monitored with a 500-nm cut-off filter. Oregon Green taxol was excited at 488 nm, and the emission was monitored through a 500-nm cut-off filter. Fluorescence Lifetime Measurements—Fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed with a Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorimeter equipped with an IBH 5000 photon-counting lifetime system (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Data from donor-acceptor decays were analyzed as a static Gaussian distribution of distances, as described previously (38Xing J. Wriggers W. Jefferson G.M. Stein R. Cheung H.C. Rosenfeld S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35413-35423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Values of R0 using Oregon Green were calculated using the quantum yield disodium fluorescein in 0.01 m NaOH as a reference (0.91, see Ref. 39Heidecker M. Yan-Marriott Y. Marriott G. Biochemistry. 1995; 37: 14428-14436Google Scholar) Microtubule Preparation and ATPase Assays—Microtubules were labeled with mant-GDP in their exchangeable nucleotide-binding site by polymerizing tubulin with 2 mm mant-GTP. The microtubule-activated ATPase rate was measured by mixing 20-30 nm Eg5 with a greater than 20-fold molar excess of taxol-stabilized microtubules in 100 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, pH 7.20. ATP hydrolysis was monitored by the oxidation of NADH in an enzyme-linked assay, as described (28De La Cruz E.M. Sweeney H.L. Ostap E.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1524-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Using FRET to Monitor Eg5 Domain Movement—Our approach in this study was to utilize five different FRET donor-acceptor pairs in order to monitor the kinetics of movement of one part of the Eg5 motor relative to another or relative to the microtubule. These pairs utilized a series of probes located on the microtubule (Oregon Green taxol, mant-GDP, and tryptophan) and on the Eg5 motor (tryptophan 127, AEDANS, or Oregon Green on the neck linker, and 2′dmD in the catalytic site). Fig. 1 illustrates on the tertiary structure of Eg5 the locations of tryptophan 127 (green), valine 365 (yellow, converted to cysteine in the Eg5 CLM mutants), and ADP (multicolored). Because all four of the cysteines in wild type Eg5-367 were reactive with sulfhydryl-specific fluorescent probes, it was necessary to mutate each of them to cysteines, and this is described under “Experimental Procedures.” In addition, because we wished to place a fluorescent probe on the neck linker to monitor movements of this domain, we converted valine 365 to a cysteine. Finally, because we also wished to monitor FRET from microtubule tryptophan residues to an AEDANS probe on the neck linker, we also needed to convert Trp-127 to phenylalanine. The resulting construct was called CLM-W127F. We needed to ensure that these modifications had minimal effects on the enzymatic behavior of Eg5, and to do so, we examined the microtubule-activated ATPase activity of wild type and CLM-W127F. The ATPase rate data fit Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with values of kcat and K0.5, MT of 8.9 ± 0.7 s-1 and 6.8 ± 1.1 μm (where MT is microtubule) for wild type Eg5, and 8.6 ± 0.7 s-1 and 6.3 ± 1.2 μm, respectively, for CLM-W127F. Hence, microtubule-dependent activation of the ATPase activity is essentially unaffected by these mutations. FRET Approach 1, Microtubule Tryptophan to Mant Nucleotide in the Motor Catalytic Site Monitors Nucleotide Binding and Motor Dissociation from the Microtubule—In our previous study of kinesin I, we had shown that binding of the fluorescent ATP analogue 2′dmT to a microtubule-kinesin complex could be monitored by FRET from the microtubule tryptophan residues to the mant fluorophor (25Rosenfeld S.S. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40167-40174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Mixing a kinesin-microtubule complex with 2′dmT produces a biphasic fluorescence change, consisting of an initial rising phase, because of binding of 2′dmT to the active site, followed by a falling phase, because of dissociation of the motor from the microtubule. We have performed a similar study with CLM-W127F, and the design of the experiment is depicted schematically in Fig. 2A. The magenta rays (Fig. 2A) emanating from the motor represent FRET emission from the mant fluorophor. Fig. 2B demonstrates a transient produced by mixing a CLM-W127F:microtubule with 120 μm 2′dmT. The rate of the rising phase, reflecting binding of 2′dmT to the empty catalytic site, varies hyperbolically with 2′dmT concentration (Fig. 2B, inset, closed circles) with an apparent second order rate constant of 1.1 ± 0.03 μm-1 s-1, an apparent dissociation rate constant of 19 ± 9.6 s-1, an apparent dissociation constant of 55 ± 12 μm, and a maximum rate of 62 ± 17 s-1 (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONESummary of FRET donor acceptor pairsDonorDonor locationAcceptorAcceptor locationSteps detectedTryptophanMicrotubuleAEDANSNeck linkerStrong to weak transitionTryptophanEg5 (position 127)AEDANSNeck linkerATP-induced neck linker dockingTryptophanMicrotubuleMant nucleotideEg5 nucleotide-binding siteATP-induced neck linker dockingMotor dissociation from microtubule Eg5:ADP binding to microtubuleDissociation of ADP from Eg5Mant-GDPMicrotubuleOregon GreenNeck linkerStrong to weak transitionOregon Green taxolMicrotubuleQSY7Neck linkerATP, ADP-induced neck linker movement motor dissociation Open table in a new tab The rate of the falling phase (Fig. 2B, inset, open circles), reflecting dissociation, reached a maximum value of 6.3 ± 0.3 s-1. This corresponds to a dissociation rate constant measured by turbidity of 6.7 ± 0.6 s-1 at a final [ATP] of 1 mm (data not shown) and compares to a value of 7.8 ± 0.2 s-1 reported in a prior study and at a higher temperature (25 °C; Ref. 29Cochran J.C.

Furthermore, the amplitudes of the two phases were identical within 10%, as would have been predicted from the model (Fig. 2A). Qualitatively similar results were seen with the fluorescent ADP analogue 2′dmD, and results will be discussed below. FRET Approach 2, Microtubule Oregon Green Taxol to Eg5 Neck Linker QSY7 Monitors Neck Linker Docking and Motor Dissociation—The rate constant for binding of 2′ dm T to a microtubule-kinesin I complex is >1000 s-1 at room temperature (25Rosenfeld S.S. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40167-40174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This >20-fold difference suggests that in Eg5, ATP binding occurs only after a slow, rate-limiting isomerization that affects the structure of the catalytic site. We wished to determine what this isomerization looks like. To do so, we developed a different FRET approach that would allow us to correlate movements of the neck linker with the kinetics of ATP binding. This consisted of FRET from Oregon Green 488-labeled taxol, bound to the microtubule, to QSY7 maleimide, a nonfluorescent probe, bound to the CLM-W127F neck linker. Because this FRET approach is new, we wished to validate its use by first applying it to kinesin I, because we had previously characterized the kinetics of its neck linker movements (11Rosenfeld S.S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40167-40174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Current models of kinesin I propose that in the absence of ATP, the neck linker is flexible and disordered. Binding of ATP, but not ADP, causes the neck linker to “dock” along a hydrophobic groove on the motor domain, and thereby become ordered and oriented parallel to the long axis of the motor domain and the microtubule protofilament (1Cooke R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 643-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2Vale R.D. Cell. 2003; 112: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 3Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar). Hence, we would predict that FRET between a donor on the microtubule and an acceptor on the kinesin I neck linker might be able to sense this change in state. Fig. 3A illustrates a schematic of the reaction produced by mixing a complex of Oregon Green taxol microtubules plus a QSY7-labeled monomeric kinesin construct (K349) with ATP. In a rigor complex, under conditions where the neck linker is presumed to be disordered, the mean distance between these two probes, determined by FRET, is 37 Å. In the presence of AMPPNP, where the neck linker is docked, it is 57 Å (TABLE THREE). We would therefore predict that mixing a complex of Oregon Green taxol-labeled microtubules + QSY7-labeled K349 should increase the fluorescence emission of the donor in at least two steps, one associated with ATP binding (producing docking) and the second with dissociation from the microtubule.TABLE THREEFRET-determined distances between microtubule-bound taxol and neck linker for monomeric kinesin I and Eg5 constructsConstructConditionRoRHalf-widthÅÅÅK349Rigor37.737.33.6K349AMPPNP37.756.91.2CLM-W127FRigor58.960.29.1CLM-W127FAMPPNP58.965.24.9 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3B illustrates the fluorescence transients produced by mixing with ATP (red) and ADP (green) and confirms this prediction. The transient produced by mixing with ATP consists of two phases of increasing fluorescence, separated by a lag. Maximum rate constants for each of these phases are 686.7 ± 157.8 s-1, 292.2 ± 13.0 s-1 (lag), and 54.8 ± 1.8 s-1 (Fig. 3C, red, blue and green curves). These correspond to previously measured rates of neck linker docking, ATP hydrolysis, and ATP-induced dissociation of ≈700-800, 250-300, and 75-85 s-1, respectively (25Rosenfeld S.S. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40167-40174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A.

Thus, this donor-acceptor FRET pair can detect the processes of neck linker docking and motor dissociation. When this experiment was repeated in the absence of acceptor, no fluorescence change could be detected over a 500-ms observation period (data not shown). For ADP, the fluorescence increase, reflecting separation of the QSY7 quencher from the Oregon Green taxol donor, is monophasic and presumably reflects the fact that although ADP cannot dock the kinesin I neck linker, it can still dissociate kinesin I from the microtubule. This would separate the Oregon Green taxol from the QSY7 fluorescence quencher and increase the fluorescence. The rate constant for this process, reflecting ADP-induced dissociation, fits a hyperbolic dependence on [ADP], defining a ma"

The structural details involved in the formation of receptor dimers or oligomers have not been elucidated, with little experimental evidence for fundamental questions, such as their behavior at the cell surface, whether the oligomers remain intact or separate, and if homooligomers and heterooligomers behave differently. That the oligomerized GPCR structures modulate the properties and conformations of the individual constituent receptors involved has been shown for μ- and δ-opioid receptor heterooligomers (8George S.R.

The biophysical techniques utilized to investigate GPCR oligomers, such as bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (14Gales C. Rebois R.V. Hogue M. Trieu P. Breit A. Hebert T.E. Bouvier M. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (9McVey M. Ramsay D. Kellett E. Rees S. Wilson S. Pope A.J. Milligan G. J. Biol.

Science. 2000; 288: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), permitted the analysis of receptor-receptor or receptor-protein interactions in situ, within living cells. However, these techniques still have only limited ability to investigate the many aspects of oligomer structure or function that still remain unknown. There is a need to provide insight into the questions regarding receptor oligomeric complexes, such as (i) the precise sites of interactions maintaining monomers in a dimer formation; (ii) whether true heterodimers exist or only homodimers within a heterooligomeric complex; (iii) whether the homodimer interactions differ from the heterodimer; (iv) the numbers of dimers in an oligomer; and (v) whether oligomers form larger complexes and can be functionally regulated. Thus, elucidation of the mechanism underlying the formation of oligomeric structures, analysis of their functional properties, or analysis of their behavior in cells requires new experimental paradigms. We wished to explore some of the above aspects of oligomerization to understand the dynamics governing the formation and trafficking of oligomers, to ultimately understand the functional relevance of oligomers in cellular processes. We devised a strategy that engineered the trafficking of a GPCR to another cellular compartment and hypothesized that if it took with it its oligomeric partner, this would provide definitive proof of oligomerization and provide a tool to study its dynamics in the cell. We and others determined that homodimerization in the rhodopsin-like GPCRs utilizes a transmembrane domain dimer interface (6Lee S.P. O'Dowd B.F. Ng G.Y. Varghese G. Akil H. Mansour A. Nguyen T.

Moreover, this process may permit us to visualize homo- and heterooligomer formation and, using conformationally altered receptor variants, to probe the contribution of the receptor structure to the stability of oligomers. To achieve our goals, a nuclear translocation pathway was exploited for GPCRs. Translocation of proteins to the nucleus involves nuclear transport proteins that recognize nuclear localization signal sequences (NLSs) (19Jans D.A. Xiao C-Y. Lam M.H.C. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 532-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), which recruit importin carrier proteins, that mediate protein translocation to the nucleus. Only a few GPCRs contain endogenous NLSs (20Lu D. Yang H. Shaw G. Raizada M.K. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chen R. Mukhin Y.V. Garnovskaya M.N. Thielen T.E.

Bone. 2000; 26: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). One example, the angiotensin AT1 receptor, contains an endogenous NLS in helix 8, which serves to direct the receptor into the nucleus in certain cells (10Lee D.K. Lanca A.J. Cheng R. Nguyen T.

Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors each have been shown to form homooligomers and together to form heterooligomers (13Lee S.P. So C.H. Rashid A.J. Varghese G. Cheng R. Lanca A.J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J.

Seeman P. Lee S.P O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and our demonstration of D1 and D2 receptor complexes by co-immunoprecipitation from rat brain and heterologous cells demonstrated that these receptors heterooligomerize (13Lee S.P. So C.H. Rashid A.J. Varghese G. Cheng R. Lanca A.J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35671-35678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The functional synergism between D1 and D2 dopamine receptors was evidenced by the generation of a novel calcium signal by receptor coactivation (13Lee S.P. So C.H. Rashid A.J. Varghese G. Cheng R. Lanca A.J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35671-35678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). By fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis, we revealed that the D1 and D2 receptors exist in close proximity on the cell surface, presumably within a heterooligomeric complex. Furthermore, the D1 and D2 receptor heterooligomers displayed novel agonist-induced internalization and trafficking patterns, distinct from that of D1 and D2 receptor homooligomers (26So C.H. Varghese G. Curley K.J. Kong M.M. Alijaniaram M. Ji X. Nguyen T. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 568-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that incorporating an NLS into several of the dopamine receptors mediated receptor translocation to the nucleus. We used this translocation strategy as outlined (Fig. 1a) to understand the ability of these GPCRs to co-traffic with their oligomerization partners as a test of the robustness of the interaction between them and to probe the structural conformation of homo- and heterooligomers after ligand occupancy and after introduction of structural variation by point mutagenesis. The method enabled the identification of both homo- and heterooligomers for the dopamine receptors and demonstrated that both types of interactions were robust enough to result in co-trafficking of oligomeric partners to the nucleus. Conformational homogeneity of the receptors was necessary to maintain the integrity of a homooligomer, and the interaction between similar receptors within a homomeric structure could not be disrupted. Furthermore, the introduction of any structural dissimilarity of the receptors within the homooligomer, whether induced by drug occupancy or point mutation, resulted in the ability to disrupt these oligomeric structures in living cells. However, within the D1-D2 heterooligomer, conformational alteration by antagonist occupancy of one receptor was unable to affect the conformation of the other, and we defined a structural alteration that prevented oligomerization of D1 and D2 receptors, indicating that the arrangement of the receptors within the heterooligomer may be substantially different from that within a homooligomer. Importantly, the strategy described provides a means of testing the robustness of the interaction between receptors, which will be useful to determine points of contact forming the oligomers.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 969-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar), and pDsRed2-nuc were obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Cell Culture—HEK cells grown on 60-mm plates in minimum essential medium were transfected with 0.5-2 μg of cDNA using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Dopamine antagonists (+)-butaclamol or SCH 23390, when used, was added to cells at 6, 22, 30, and 42 h, and cells were visualized by confocal microscopy at 48 h post-transfection. Microscopy—Live cells expressing GFP and pDsRed2 fusion proteins were visualized with an LSM510 Zeiss confocal laser microscope. In each experiment, 5-8 fields, containing 50-80 cells/field were evaluated, and the entire experiment was repeated 2-4 times (n = 3-5). Fluorocytometry—50,000 cells were added to each well (96-well plate) and transfected with 0.5 μg of cDNA. Minimum essential medium containing antagonists at varying concentrations were added to wells in pentuplicate. The drugs were prepared as 1 mm concentration stock and diluted in growth medium to achieve a concentration between 10 nm and 10 μm. After 48 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with the primary antibody (rat anti-HA antibody, 1:200 dilution; Roche Applied Science) and secondary antibody conjugated to FITC (goat anti-rat antibody, 1:32 dilution; Sigma). Cell surface fluorescence was detected using a Cytofluor 4000 (PerSeptive Biosystems). Each experiment was repeated three or four times. Background fluorescence from media, cells, plastic, etc. was evaluated in each experiment and subtracted from the readings. DNA Constructs—All of the DNA encoding the GPCRs were from humans. Sequences encoding GPCRs were cloned into plasmid pEGFP, pDsRed2-N1, or pcDNA3. Receptor Constructs—The D1(S198A/S199A) and D1(S199A/S202A) receptors were prepared using the Quikchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the following sets of primers: D1(S198A/S199A), forward (5′-GGACATATGCCATGTCAGCCGCCGTAATAAGCTTTTACATCCC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGGATGTAAAAGCTTATTACGGCGGCTGAGATGGCATATGTCC-3′); D1(S199A/S202A), forward (5′-GCAGGACATATGCCATCTCATCCGCCGTAATAGCCTTTTACATCCCTGTGG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCACAGGGATGTAAAAGGCTATTACGGCGGATGAGATGGCATATGTCCTGC-3′). D1-NLS-GFP—Receptor DNA was subjected to PCR as previously reported (29Marchese A. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Lynch K. Identification and Expression of G Protein Coupled Receptors. Wiley-Liss, New York1998: 1-26Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of H2O (32 μl), 10× Pfu buffer (Stratagene) (5 μl), dNTP (10 mm, 5 μl), Me2SO (5 μl), oligonucleotide primers (100 ng, 1 μl each), DNA template (100 ng), and Pfu enzyme (5 units). Total volume was 50 μl. PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle at 94 °C for 2 min and 30-35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min per cycle and then one cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. Primer Set for Amplification of the DNA Encoding the D1 Receptor—Primers were as follows: HD1-P1, 5′-GAGGACTCTGAACACCGAATTCGCCGCCATGGACGGGACTGGGCTGGTG-3′; HD1-P2, 5′-GTGTGGCAGGATTCATCTGGGTACCGCGGTTGGGTGCTGACCGTT-3′. The restriction site EcoRI was incorporated in the primer HD1-P1, and KpnI was incorporated into HD1-P2. The PCR product, containing no stop codon was subcloned into vector pEGFP at EcoRI and KpnI and in frame with the start codon of GFP. The NLS sequence, KKFKR, was inserted into DNA encoding the base of TM7 (helix 8) of the D1 dopamine receptor by PCR, replacing the sequence 336DFRKA. Primer Set for the Construction of DNA Encoding D1-NLS—Primers were as follows: HD1-NLSF, 5′-CCTAAGAGGGTTGAAAATCTTTTAAATTTTTTAGCATTAAAGGCATAAATG-3′; HD1-NLSR, 5′-GCCTTTAATGCTAAAAAATTTAAAAGATTTTCAACCCTCTTAGGATGC-3′. Using the DNA encoding D1-GFP as template, PCR with the primers HD1-P1 and HD1-NLSF resulted in a product of 1000 bp (PCR1). Using DNA encoding D1-GFP, PCR with primers HD1-P2 and HD1-NLSR resulted in a product of 300 bp (PCR2). A subsequent PCR carried out with HD1-P1 and HD1-P2 primers resulted in a product of 1300 bp using the product from PCR1 and the product from PCR2 as templates. The resulting DNA encoding D1-NLS was subcloned into vector pEGFP at EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites. All of the additional constructs described below were made using the same PCR method and experimental conditions as described above for the D1 dopamine receptor, but with the specific primers as described below. Primer Set for the Construction of D1-IC1-NLS—Primers were as follows: D1-NLSF-IC1, 5′-GTGCTGCCGTTAAAAAGTTCAAACGCCTGCGGTCCAAGG-3′; D1-NLSR-IC1, 5′-GGACCGCAGGCGTTTGAACTTTTTAACGGCAGCACAGACC-3′. KKFKR was inserted into the intracellular loop, replacing 49IRFRH. Primer Set for the Construction of D1-IC2-NLS—Primers were as follows: D1NLSF-IC2, 5′-CCGGTATGAGAAAAAGTTTAAACGCAAGGCAGCCTTC-3′; D1-NLSR-IC2, 5′-GGCTGCCTTGCGTTTAAACTTTTTCTCATACCGGAAAGG-3′. KKFKR was inserted into IC2, replacing 133RKMTP. Primer Set for the Construction of D1-IC3-NLS—Primers were as follows: D1NLSF-IC3, 5′-GGAAAGTTCTTTTAAGAAGAAGTTCAAAAGAGAAAC-3′; D1-NLSR-IC3, 5′-GTTTCTCTTTTGAACTTCTTCTTAAAAGAACTTTCC-3′. KKFKR was inserted into the IC3 segment of the D1 receptor, replacing 262MSFKR. Primer Set for D2-NLS-GFP—Primers were as follows: HDNLSF, 5′-CACCACCTTCAACAAAAAATTCAAAAGAGCCTTCCTGAAGATCC-3′; HD2-NLSR, 5′-GGATCTTCAGGAAGGCTCTTTTGAATTTTTTGTTGAAGGTGGTG-3′. The sequence KKFKR was inserted in the D2 receptor, replacing 431IEFRK. Primer Set for the Construction of SPGFP-D2—The D2 cDNA was isolated by the PCR method using the following set of primers: D2sp-BsrGI, 5′-TGTACAGCCGCCATGGATCCACTGAATCTGTCC-3′; D2sp-NotI, 5′-GAGTCGCGGCCGCTTCAGCAGTGGAGGATCTTCAGGAAGG-3′. This PCR product was then subcloned into the SP-GFP vector at restriction sites BsrGI and NotI. Primer Set for the Construction of SPGFP-D2-NLS—Using the SPGFP-D2 as template, the NLS KKFKR was introduced into helix 8 of the D2 by the PCR method using the following set of primers: HD2-NLSF, 5′-CACCACCTTCAACAAAAAATTCAAAAGAGCCTTCCTGAAGATCC-3′; HD2-NLSR, 5′-GGATCTTCAGGAAGGCTCTTTTGAATTTTTTGTTGAAGGTGGTG-3′. The sequence KKFRK was inserted in the D2 receptor, replacing 431IEFRK. Primer Set for the Construction of D5-GFP—The human D5 was isolated by PCR with primers HD5-EcoRI (5′ CTGGAATTCTGCAGATTCCAGCCCGAAATGCTGCCGCC-3′) and HD5-Kpn (5′-CGCCAGTGTGATGGATAATGGTACCGCATGGAATCCATTCGGGGTG-3′) and subcloned into the enhanced green fluorescent protein vector at the restriction sites EcoRI and KpnI. Primer Set for the Construction of SPGFP-D5—The human D5 was isolated by PCR with the following set of primers: D5-BsrGI, 5′-CCAGCCCGTGTACAAATGCTGCCGCCAGGCAGC-3′; D5-NotI, 5′-GCGGCCGCTTAATGGAATCCATTCGGGG-3′. This PCR product was then subcloned into the SP-GFP vector at restriction sites BsrGI and NotI. The Construction of D1-mRFP—mRFP1 in the pRSETb vector was a gift from Dr. Irine Prastio (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Diego). Using this vector as template, the mRFP was isolated by PCR using the following two primers: mRFP-BAMH, 5′-GATAAGGATCCGATGGCCTCCTCCGAGG-3′; mRFP-NOT, 5′-CGAATTCGCGGCCGCTAGGCGCCGGTGGAGTGGCGG-3′. This PCR product was then used to replace the GFP from the pEGFP-N1 vector at the restriction sites BamHI and NotI, thus creating the mRFP vector. Human D1 was excised from the D1-GFP construct by restriction digest with EcoRI and KpnI and subcloned into the mRFP vector at the same restriction sites EcoRI and KpnI and thus in frame with the mRFP. The Construction of D1-NLS (Helix 8)-mRFP—Human D1-NLS (helix 8) was excised from the D1-NLS (helix 8)-GFP construct by restriction digest with EcoRI and KpnI and subcloned into the mRFP vector at the same restriction sites EcoRI and KpnI and in frame with the mRFP. Primer Set for CysLT2-NLS-GFP—Primers used were LT2-NLSF, 5′-GCTGGGAAAAAATTTAAAAGAAGACTAAAGTCTGCAC-3′ and LT2-NLSR (5′-GTCTTCTTTTAAATTTTTTCCCAGCAAAGTAATAGAGC-3′). The sequence KKFKR was inserted into the cysteinyl leukotriene 2 receptor, replacing 310ENFKD. The initial objective was to generate a GPCR that would traffic to the nucleus under basal conditions and permit ligand-occupied conformational changes to modulate this process. Optimization of the Position of the NLS within the D1 Dopamine Receptor in a Conformation-dependent Site—To determine the optimal site for NLS incorporation that would provide the most efficient receptor translocation to the nucleus, the D1 dopamine receptor was modified. Since the proteins that carry NLS-containing proteins to the nucleus, such as the importins, are cytoplasmic, the optimal placement of the NLS was investigated by its introduction into various positions within the three intracellular loops, helix 8, and the carboxyl tail of D1; each of these locations is illustrated in Fig. 1b. When expressed in cells, the unmodified D1 receptor tagged with GFP was localized on the cell surface in the majority of the cells (>90%) at 48 h post-transfection as visualized by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2a, upper left panel). Cells transfected with the D1 receptor containing the NLS in helix 8 (D1-NLS) revealed a basal localization of receptor in the nucleus at 48 h post-transfection (Fig. 2a, upper right panel) observed in over 90% of cells. The localization of the receptor in the nucleus was confirmed using a nuclear dye (Hoechst 33342) (Fig. 2a, lower panels). Thus, incorporation of a NLS into the D1 receptor sequence in helix 8 resulted in efficient trafficking of the receptor under basal conditions to the nucleus. A series of tomographic images (Z-stacks) obtained by confocal microscopy confirmed the nuclear localization of the D1-NLS. Investigation of the effect of the NLS inserted in various other intracellular positions of the receptor revealed that D1 with an NLS inserted in the first intracellular cytoplasmic loop (D1-IC1-NLS) was expressed and detected in the nucleus in 85% of cells (Fig. 2b, left). D1 with the NLS inserted in the second intracellular cytoplasmic loop (D1-IC2-NLS) was expressed and detected in the nucleus in 51% of cells. In this case, over 40% of cells still had receptor detectable on the cell surface, indicating that incorporation of the NLS in this position was not as efficient in translocating the receptor from the cell surface. D1 with the NLS inserted in the third intracellular cytoplasmic loop (D1-IC3-NLS) was expressed and detected in the nucleus of 85% of cells (Fig. 2b, middle). D1 with an NLS inserted in a distal position in the carboxyl tail (D1-CT-NLS) was expressed and was detected at the cell surface and also in the nucleus (Fig. 2b, right). The distribution of D1-GFP-NLS where the NLS was attached distal to the GFP fused to D1, showed expression in the cytoplasm and cell surface but little expression in the nucleus (data not shown). To determine the effect of occupancy of the binding pocket on the NLS within various positions of the receptor on trafficking to the nucleus, we used several antagonists with inverse agonist properties to induce a conformational change in the receptor. Although receptor agonists would also induce conformational changes in the receptor, we wished to preclude agonist-induced internalization mechanisms, which would confound the evaluation of NLS-mediated trafficking. Cells expressing D1-NLS were treated with the dopamine receptor antagonist (+)-butaclamol ((+)BTC) or SCH 23390 6 h post-transfection. With (+)BTC (1 μm) treatment for 48 h, there was a very efficient retention of the D1-NLS receptor on the cell surface (85% of cells) with little translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 2c, left). This effect was also found with the D1 receptor-selective antagonist SCH 23390. Stereoselectivity of this effect was demonstrated by the lack of effect of (-)BTC (1 μm) treatment of the cells. In addition, the specificity of the D1 antagonist on receptor translocation was tested by treating D1-NLS-expressing cells with the D2 receptor-selective antagonist raclopride (1 μm), which was unable to retain the receptor at the cell surface. D1-NLS was expressed and treated with (+)BTC (500 nm) for 48 h, and at this time, the receptor was located at the cell surface (100% of cells). The (+)BTC was removed, and the receptor distribution was examined at 3, 6, 13, 16, 19, and 24 h. Between 13 and 16 h, the receptor had left the cell surface and was distributed to the nucleus in 80% of cells. Cells expressing D1-IC1-NLS treated with either (+)BTC (1 μm) or SCH 23390 (1 μm) also revealed retention of receptor at the cell surface in 82% of cells (Fig. 2c, middle) and 77% of the cells, respectively, compared with 76% of cells with receptor expression in the nucleus with no treatment. In contrast, cells expressing D1-IC3-NLS treated with antagonist (+)BTC or SCH 23390 revealed ∼90 and 84% of cells with receptor in the nucleus, indicating no ability of the drugs to retard the translocation of"
https://openalex.org/W2059120735,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to play important roles in regulating diverse biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration. Its role in regulating human Toll-like receptors (TLRs), key host defense receptors that recognize invading bacterial pathogens, however, remains unknown. Here we show for the first time that EGFR acts as a negative regulator for TLR2 induction by the bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) in vitro and in vivo. The negative regulation of TLR2 induction by EGFR is mediated via an Src-MKK3/6-p38 α/β MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Moreover, direct activation of EGFR signaling by the bacterium NTHi-derived EGF-like factor appears to be responsible for triggering the downstream Src-MKK3/6-p38 MAPK signaling, which in turn leads to the negative regulation of TLR2 induction. Finally, exogenous EGF increases NTHi invasion of host epithelial cells, thereby demonstrating the biological significance of TLR2 regulation by EGFR signaling. The evidence we provided in the present study may suggest a novel strategy utilized by bacteria to attenuate host defensive and immune response by negatively regulating the expression of host defense receptor TLR2. These studies may bring new insight for fully understanding the important role of EGFR signaling in regulating host defense and immune response by tightly controlling TLR2 induction during bacterial infections. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown to play important roles in regulating diverse biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration. Its role in regulating human Toll-like receptors (TLRs), key host defense receptors that recognize invading bacterial pathogens, however, remains unknown. Here we show for the first time that EGFR acts as a negative regulator for TLR2 induction by the bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) in vitro and in vivo. The negative regulation of TLR2 induction by EGFR is mediated via an Src-MKK3/6-p38 α/β MAP kinase-dependent mechanism. Moreover, direct activation of EGFR signaling by the bacterium NTHi-derived EGF-like factor appears to be responsible for triggering the downstream Src-MKK3/6-p38 MAPK signaling, which in turn leads to the negative regulation of TLR2 induction. Finally, exogenous EGF increases NTHi invasion of host epithelial cells, thereby demonstrating the biological significance of TLR2 regulation by EGFR signaling. The evidence we provided in the present study may suggest a novel strategy utilized by bacteria to attenuate host defensive and immune response by negatively regulating the expression of host defense receptor TLR2. These studies may bring new insight for fully understanding the important role of EGFR signaling in regulating host defense and immune response by tightly controlling TLR2 induction during bacterial infections.

Ligand binding to a monomeric receptor tyrosine kinase activates the kinase activity by promoting receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. The latter serve as docking sites for a variety of signaling effectors, which simultaneously initiate many signaling cascades such as Src-dependent activation of MAPK cascade. The EGFR is widely expressed in mammalian epithelial tissues. Despite its important roles in regulating diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and adhesion, the role of EGFR in regulating human defense response, especially the Toll-like receptor (TLR) (5Aderem A.

Although originally described as a receptor for epidermal growth factors, recent studies have demonstrated that EGFR also acts as receptors for viruses (8Miller W.E. Raab-Traub N.

In addition, EGFR has also been shown to be activated by the bacterium Helicobactor pylori via an autocrine-dependent manner (12Keates S. Sougioultzis S. Keates A.C. Zhao D. Peek Jr., R.M. Shaw L.M.

However, it still remains unclear whether EGFR can be directly activated by bacteria or bacteria-derived factors via a mechanism independent of autocrine signaling. epidermal growth factor receptor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease nontypeable H. influenzae mitogen-activated protein kinase MAP kinase MAP kinase kinase Toll-like receptor epidermal growth factor multiplicity of infection 6-carboxyfluorescein small interfering RNA phosphate-buffered saline enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay constitutively active dominant negative In the host innate immune system, the surface epithelial cells are situated at host-environment boundaries and thus act as the first line of host defense against pathogenic bacteria (5Aderem A.

The principal challenge for the host is to detect efficiently the invading pathogen and mount a rapid defensive response. They recognize the invading bacteria by directly interacting with pathogen-associated molecular patterns on a variety of bacteria via TLRs expressed on the host (5Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2632) Google Scholar, 6Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). Activation of TLRs, in turn, leads to induction of direct antimicrobial activity that can result in elimination of the invading pathogen before a full adaptive immune response takes effect (14Thoma-Uszynski S. Stenger S. Takeuchi O. Ochoa M.T. Engele M. Sieling P.A. Barnes P.F. Röllinghoff M. Bölcskei P.L. Wagner M. Akira S. Norgard M.V. Belisle J.T. Godowski P.J. Bloom B.R. Modlin R.L. Science. 2001; 291: 1544-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of TLRs is also a prerequisite for the triggering of acquired immunity (15Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 987-995Crossref Scopus (3368) Google Scholar). TLRs are type I transmembrane receptors with leucine-rich repeats in the extracellular domains and cytoplasmic domains that resemble the mammalian interleukin-1 receptor (5Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2632) Google Scholar, 6Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar, 7Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). To date, 11 members of the human TLR family have been cloned (6Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar, 7Kopp E. Medzhitov R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 16Zhang D. Zhang G.

Whereas TLR4 seems to be mainly involved in Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide signaling, TLR2 can respond to a variety of Gram-positive products, including peptidoglycan, lipoprotein, lipoteichoic acid, and lipoarabinomannan (5Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2632) Google Scholar, 6Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar, 7Kopp E.

The importance of TLR2 in host defense was further highlighted by the studies from knock-out mice showing decreased survival of TLR2-deficient mice after infection with Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (17Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our recent study demonstrated that TLR2 also plays a key role in activating host immune and inflammatory response by surface lipoprotein from the Gram-negative bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), a major cause of otitis media and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (18Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 19Jono H. Shuto T. Xu H. Kai H. Lim D.J.

Commun. 2004; 324: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that TLR2 plays a crucial role in host defense against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Although under physiological conditions TLR2 is expressed at a low level in epithelial cells, its expression is greatly up-regulated during bacterial infections via an NF-κB-dependent manner (23Shuto T. Imasato A. Jono H. Sakai A. Xu H. Watanabe T. Rixter D.D. Kai H. Andalibi A. Linthicum F. Guan Y.L. Han J. Cato A.C. Lim D.J. Akira S. Li J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47444-47450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The finding that TLR2 is greatly induced from low to high levels during bacterial infection may have several important implications in host defense and immune response against bacteria. First, the very low expression of TLR2 we observed in unstimulated epithelial cells is likely to be an important aspect of TLR2 function because under limiting conditions the cellular responses to pathogen-associated molecular patterns could be more stringently regulated by controlling the amounts of TLR protein produced (25Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Spitzer J.H. Wyllie D.H. Dower S.K. Segal D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Second, the increased TLR2 expression will probably contribute to the accelerated immune response by epithelial cells as well as the resensitization of epithelial cells to invading pathogens. If so, tight regulation of TLR2 expression should be one of the important immune-regulatory mechanisms commonly involved in host defense against many bacterial strains. Despite the extensive studies on the roles of TLR in host defense and immune response, how the expression of TLR during bacterial infections is tightly regulated still remains largely unknown. Given the important role that EGFR plays in mediating physiological cellular responses such as proliferation and differentiation, its role in regulating pathological cellular response such as host defense and immune response also remains poorly understood (1Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The role of EGFR signaling in regulating TLR, the host defense receptor, is totally unclear. In the present study, we provide evidence for the first time that EGFR acts as a negative regulator for TLR2 induction by bacterium NTHi via an Src-MKK3/6-p38 α/β MAP kinase-dependent mechanism in vitro and in vivo. Direct activation of EGFR signaling by the NTHi-derived EGF-like factor appears to be responsible for triggering the downstream Src-MKK3/6-p38 MAPK signaling, which in turn leads to the negative regulation of TLR2 induction. Exogenous EGF increased NTHi invasion of host epithelial cells, thereby providing supportive evidence for the biological significance of TLR2 regulation by EGFR signaling. These findings provide novel insights into the important role of EGFR signaling in regulating host defense and immune response by tightly controlling TLR2 induction during bacterial infections.

For making NTHi crude extract, NTHi were harvested from a plate of chocolate agar after overnight incubation and incubated in 30 ml of brain heart infusion broth supplemented with NAD (3.5 μg/ml). After overnight incubation, NTHi were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The resulting pellet of NTHi was suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated. Subsequently, the lysate was collected and stored at –70 °C. Live bacteria of NTHi at an m.o.i. of 100:1 were used to treat the epithelial cells. NTHi lysates (15 μg/ml) were used to treat the cells for all of the other experiments. We chose to use NTHi lysates because of the following reasons. First, NTHi has been shown to be highly fragile and has the tendency to autolyze. Its autolysis can be triggered in vivo under various conditions, including antibiotic treatment. Therefore, using lysates of NTHi represents a common clinical condition in vivo, especially after antibiotic treatment.

All media received additions of 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Real Time Quantitative PCR Analysis of TLR2 and EGF—Total RNA was isolated by using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) by following the manufacturer's instructions. For the reverse transcription reaction, TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used. Briefly, the reverse transcription reaction was performed for 60 min at 37 °C, followed by 60 min at 42 °C by using oligo(dT) and random hexamers. PCR amplification was performed by using TaqMan Universal Master Mix for TLR2 and mTLR2 or SYBR Green Universal Master Mix for EGF. In brief, reactions were performed in duplicate containing 2× Universal Master Mix, 1 μl of template cDNA, 100 nm primers, and 100 nm probe in a final volume of 12.5 μl, and they were analyzed in a 96-well optical reaction plate (Applied Biosystems). Probes for TaqMan included a fluorescent reporter dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), on the 5′ end and labeled with a fluorescent quencher dye, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine, on the 3′ end to allow direct detection of the PCR product. Reactions were amplified and quantified by using an ABI 7700 sequence detector and the manufacturer's corresponding software (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantity of mRNAs was obtained by using the comparative Ct method (for details, see User Bulletin 2 for the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence-detection system) and was normalized by using predeveloped TaqMan assay reagent human cyclophilin as an endogenous control (Applied Biosystems).

https://openalex.org/W2003608521,"Heme oxygenase (HO) catalyzes the catabolism of heme to biliverdin, CO, and a free iron through three successive oxygenation steps. The third oxygenation, oxidative degradation of verdoheme to biliverdin, has been the least understood step despite its importance in regulating HO activity. We have examined in detail the degradation of a synthetic verdoheme IXα complexed with rat HO-1. Our findings include: 1) HO degrades verdoheme through a dual pathway using either O2 or H2O2; 2) the verdoheme reactivity with O2 is the lowest among the three O2 reactions in the HO catalysis, and the newly found H2O2 pathway is ∼40-fold faster than the O2-dependent verdoheme degradation; 3) both reactions are initiated by the binding of O2 or H2O2 to allow the first direct observation of degradation intermediates of verdoheme; and 4) Asp140 in HO-1 is critical for the verdoheme degradation regardless of the oxygen source. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the HO enzyme activates O2 and H2O2 on the verdoheme iron with the aid of a nearby water molecule linked with Asp140. These mechanisms are similar to the well established mechanism of the first oxygenation, meso-hydroxylation of heme, and thus, HO can utilize a common architecture to promote the first and third oxygenation steps of the heme catabolism. In addition, our results infer the possible involvement of the H2O2-dependent verdoheme degradation in vivo, and potential roles of the dual pathway reaction of HO against oxidative stress are proposed.

In mammals, HO exists as two isoforms, an inducible HO-1 (Mr 33,000) and a constitutive HO-2 (Mr 36,000). Biliverdin is immediately reduced by biliverdin reductase to bilirubin, a potent antioxidant. Primary functions of the mammalian HO enzymes are excess heme catabolism, antioxidant defense, and generation of CO, a physiological messenger molecule (2Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol.

Hepatology. 2000; 31: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The HO enzymes have been identified in higher plants, cyanobacteria, and some pathogenic bacteria (8Beale S.I. Chem.

Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The heme degradation by HO proceeds through three successive oxygenation steps involving the uptake of a total of seven electrons (Fig. 1). The O2 activations in the HO catalysis are performed by the substrate heme and its catabolic intermediates (2Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The first step of the HO reaction is the regiospecific hydroxylation of the porphyrin α-meso-carbon atom (Fig. 1). The resulting α-meso-hydroxyheme reacts with another O2 to yield verdoheme and CO. Further O2 activation cleaves the heme macrocycle to afford a ferric biliverdin complex. The final one-electron reduction releases a ferrous iron and then biliverdin. The biliverdin release from HO is the slowest step in the HO catalysis but is drastically accelerated by biliverdin reductase (12Liu Y. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5297-5307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The rate-determining step of the heme degradation in vivo is considered to be the conversion of verdoheme to the ferric biliverdin complex (12Liu Y. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5297-5307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Despite its importance to regulate the enzyme activity of HO, the verdoheme degradation mechanism is the least understood in the HO catalysis. Non-enzymatic conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin can be performed by hydrolysis or by redox reactions using O2 or H2O2 (13Saito S. Itano H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1393-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 14Hirota T. Itano H.A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1983; 24: 995-998Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Koerner R. Latos-Grazynski L.

Soc. 2004; 126: 6210-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite the chemical versatility, HO has been considered to exclusively utilize O2 as an oxygen source for the verdoheme degradation. The enzyme incorporates an oxygen atom of O2 rather than of a water molecule into biliverdin (17Docherty J.C. Schacter B.A. Firneisz G.D. Brown S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13066-13069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies reported that H2O2 cannot support the HO-catalyzed verdoheme degradation (3Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 18Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although hypothetical mechanisms for the verdoheme degradation have been proposed (3Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar), they have not been experimentally evaluated. One of the major problems impeding the mechanistic investigation is inhibition of the verdoheme degradation by CO produced in the earlier step of the heme catabolism (Fig. 1). To avoid the product inhibition and to directly observe the verdoheme degradation, the reaction of HO anaerobically reconstituted with synthetic verdoheme has been examined (19Takahashi S. Mansfield Matera K. Fujii H. Zhou H. Ishikawa K. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Rousseau D.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1402-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Zhang X. Fujii H.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 5231-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The initial step of the enzymatic reaction was suggested to be the binding of O2 to verdoheme. Nevertheless, neither the O2-bound verdoheme nor its reduced forms has been detected. Even the binding site of O2 is still uncertain because resonance structures of verdoheme involving a change in iron redox state (Fig. 2) may allow the O2 binding either on the verdoheme iron or at the α-pyrrole carbon radical (3Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Oxygen activation on the verdoheme iron has been proposed, analogous to the first step of meso-hydroxylation of heme in its α-regiospecificity (20Zhang X. Fujii H. Mansfield Matera K. Migita C.T. Sun D. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7418-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). α-Selectivity of the first step is a result of steric hindrance imposed by the distal helix that covers the β-, γ-, and δ-meso-carbons but not the α-meso-carbon (23Schuller D.J. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 860-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). A ferric hydroperoxy-heme (FeIII–OOH) responsible for the meso-hydroxylation is believed to point its terminal oxygen atom toward the α-meso-carbon atom as found for ferrous oxy-heme (FeII–OO), a precursor of the hydroperoxy-heme (24Unno M. Matsui T. Chu G.C. Couture M. Yoshida T. Rousseau D.L. Olson J.S. Ikeda-Saito M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21055-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In the first step, the unique self-hydroxylation by the Fe–OOH heme is controlled by a nearby water molecule consisting of a hydrogen bond network in the active site of HO. The hydrogen bond network includes a neighboring Asp (Asp140 in HO-1), whose replacement perturbs the nearby water to disable the meso-hydroxylation by HO (25Fujii H. Zhang X. Tomita T. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6475-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Lightning L.K. Huang H. Moenne-Loccoz P. Loehr T.M. Schuller D.J. Poulos T.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 2981-2989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The role of Asp140 in the verdoheme degradation is, however, yet to be evaluated. In this work, we have explored the verdoheme degradation by using a highly purified complex of rat HO-1 and a synthetic ferrous verdoheme IXα. We have found, contrary to the earlier conclusion (3Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 18Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22357-22362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that HO-1 can utilize both O2 and H2O2 for the verdoheme degradation and have detected reaction intermediates formed during these reactions, for the first time. Substitutions of Asp140 in HO-1 have significantly lowered yields of biliverdin formed. On the basis of these unprecedented observations, we propose reaction mechanisms for a dual pathway degradation of verdoheme and further infer physiological and biochemical significance of the H2O2-dependent verdoheme degradation. Materials—H2O2, NADPH, hemin, biliverdin IXα, sodium ascorbate, catalase, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Wako, Oriental Yeast, Sigma, or ICN and used without further purification. Expression and purification of rat wild type HO-1, its D140A and D140F mutants, human CPR, and biliverdin reductase were carried out as described previously (25Fujii H. Zhang X. Tomita T.

J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1986; 1: 1-7Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Formation of verdoheme was confirmed by light absorption spectrum (λmax in pyridine: 397, 503, 533, and 680 nm) and ESI-MS (m/z: found, 619.21; calculated for [FeC33H31N4O5]+, 619.16). Concentration of the bispyridine complex of verdoheme was determined spectrophotometrically using ϵ397 = 53.3 mm-1 cm-1 (21Sakamoto H. Omata Y. Adachi Y. Palmer G. Noguchi M. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 82: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Rat HO-1 with Verdoheme IXα—All the reconstitution and purification procedures for the verdoheme-HO-1 complex described below were performed in a UNIlab anaerobic glove box (M. Braun). To the rat HO-1 solution was added a slight excess amount of verdoheme as an aqueous pyridine solution in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The pyridine content of the mixture was kept less than 3%. The mixture incubated at 2 °C for 4 h was passed through a short DEAE-cellulose column. This step was critical to remove free and non-specifically bound verdoheme. A final gel filtration (Sephadex G-25) was performed for buffer exchange to 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0. The purified complex of ferrous verdoheme and wild type HO-1 exhibited absorption maxima at 399 (ϵ = 50.2 mm-1 cm-1), 534 and 688 nm with an A399 nm/A280 nm value of 1.1. Reactions of the Verdoheme-HO-1 Complex with O2 and H2O2—Reactions of the verdoheme-HO-1 complex with O2 or H2O2 were performed in the anaerobic glove box at 20 °C. Samples for O2-dependent reactions were prepared in an optical cuvette with a screw top fitted for a rubber septum. To 1 ml of solution of the verdoheme-HO-1 complex in 0.1 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, was added varied amounts of O2-saturated buffer (1.25 mm) or a hypoxic H2O2 solution, the latter of which was incubated in the glove box for a few days prior to use to ensure complete removal of dissolved O2. Concentration of the H2O2 solution was determined immediately before use by horseradish peroxidase-assisted iodometry using ϵ353(triiodide) = 2.6 × 104 M-1 cm-1 (32Ramette R.W. Sandford R.W.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1965; 87: 5001-5005Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). NADPH and CPR were added before starting the reactions or at required time points (see “Results”). Absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1500 spectrophotometer placed in the anaerobic glove box. Reaction rates of the verdoheme-HO-1 complex (5 μm) with O2 (60–250 μm) and H2O2 (80–500 μm) were determined at 20 °C in the presence and absence of 50 μm NADPH and 0.8 μm CPR. Absorption spectral changes for the H2O2-dependent reactions were measured on a UNISOKU RSP-601 stopped-flow apparatus equipped with an anaerobic purging system. Absorbance decay at 688 nm was well fitted to a single-exponential function, and good linear relationships between the reaction rates and concentrations of O2 and H2O2 gave bimolecular rate constants (supplemental Fig. S1). Product Analysis by HPLC and ESI-MS—A solid phase extraction of the reaction mixture using a Supelclean LC-18 column (Supelco) was performed as described elsewhere (20Zhang X. Fujii H. Mansfield Matera K. Migita C.T. Sun D. Sato M. Ikeda-Saito M. Yoshida T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7418-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The green eluate was analyzed on a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with a Tosoh ODS-80Ts reverse phase column (4.6 × 150 mm) using a linear gradient from 100% solvent A to 100% methanol over 15 min at a flow rate of 0.85 ml/min. Solvent A consisted of 40% 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.1, and 60% methanol. ESI-MS of the green eluate was measured on a Bruker Bio-TOF II mass spectrometer calibrated with a mixture of NaI and CsI in water-isopropanol (1:1). Biliverdin was detected as its deprotonated anion form, [C33H34N4O6–H]- (m/z: calculated, 581.24; found for authentic biliverdin, 581.22). O2-dependent Verdoheme Degradation by HO-1—Under anaerobic conditions, addition of NADPH and CPR to the verdoheme-HO-1 complex did not cause spectral change except for an absorbance increase around 340 nm due to NADPH (Fig. 3A). Addition of O2 initiated the consumption of NADPH and verdoheme degradation (Fig. 3A). The 398 nm absorption peak of the verdoheme-HO-1 complex was shifted to around 380 nm, and the intensity of the 688 nm band decreased to approximately half to give a broad absorption around 690 nm. The final spectrum is essentially the same as that of the authentic biliverdin IXα. Product analysis by HPLC (Fig. 3D) and ESI-MS (m/z: found, 581.25; calculated for [C33H34N4O6–H]-, 581.24) confirmed biliverdin as a major product of the reaction. The yield of biliverdin was determined spectrophotometrically as a bilirubin-bovine serum albumin complex to be 84%. When using ascorbic acid instead of NADPH/CPR as a reductant, the final product was the ferric biliverdin complex (data not shown) (2Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4230-4236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The O2-dependent degradation of verdoheme was monophasic and proceeded with isosbestic points (Fig. 3A), indicating no considerable accumulation of reaction intermediates. The degradation rates of verdoheme linearly depended on the concentration of O2 (kapp = 2.5 ± 0.1 × 102 ([O] m)-1 s-1), whereas doubling the CPR concentration did not increase the degradation rate. These results indicate that the O2 binding to verdoheme is the rate determining step under the conditions employed. Therefore, the kapp value for the biliverdin formation corresponds to a rate constant of the reaction between the verdoheme-HO-1 complex and O2, which is 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the O2 binding to the heme-HO-1 complex (6.9 × 106 M-1 s-1 (33Migita C.T. Mansfield Matera K. Ikeda-Saito M. Olson J.S. Fujii H. Yoshimura T. Zhou H. Yoshida T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 945-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)). In the absence of reductants, mixing the verdoheme-HO-1 complex with O2 exhibited a biphasic spectral change (Fig. 3B). The first phase was O2-dependent and exhibited distinct isosbestic points at 366, 540, 608, and 729 nm, suggesting accumulation of an intermediate species, termed O2-intermediate. The second phase was O2-independent and the result of multiple reactions as suggested from the absence of clear isosbestic point. The latter phase reactions are non-productive decomposition of the O2-intermediate because addition of NADPH/CPR to the final product (at 50 min after the O2 injection) did not afford a significant amount of biliverdin (Fig. 3C). In contrast, reduction of the O2-intermediate (at 3 min after the O2 injection) by NADPH/CPR produced biliverdin (75% yield) as confirmed by absorption spectrum and HPLC analysis (Fig. 3, C and D). The O2-intermediate was also reduced by ascorbic acid to give the ferric biliverdin complex (data not shown). Although an exact rate of the first phase is not available due to its relatively poor resolution with the second phase reactions (Fig. 3B, inset), the O2-intermediate formation proceeds at a rate similar to that of the verdoheme degradation with O2/NADPH/CPR (Fig. 3A, inset). These observations unambiguously indicate that the verdoheme-HO-1 complex initially reacts with O2 to form the O2-intermediate whose reduction affords biliverdin via the ferric biliverdin complex. H2O2-dependent Verdoheme Degradation by HO-1—It has been reported that HO cannot utilize H2O2 for the verdoheme degradation (3Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem.

However, anaerobic addition of H2O2 in the presence of NADPH and CPR immediately (∼30 s with 30 μm H2O2) converted the verdoheme-HO-1 complex to biliverdin in 86% yield, which was identified by absorption spectrum (Fig. 4A), HPLC (Fig. 4D) and ESI-MS analysis (m/z: found, 581.30; calculated for [C33H34N4O6–H]-, 581.24). This monophasic and rapid degradation with isosbestic points is not mediated by residual O2 in the H2O2 solution used because co-incubation with catalase drastically slowed down the reaction (∼20 min with 30 μm H2O2 and 1 kilounit/ml catalase). Anaerobic stopped-flow experiments revealed linear dependence of the degradation rates of verdoheme on the H2O2 concentration (kapp = 8.8 ± 0.1 × 103 ([H2 O2] m)-1 s-1), which is 35-fold faster than the conventional O2-supported reaction. If ascorbic acid instead of NADPH/CPR was used as a reductant, the final product was the ferric biliverdin complex (data not shown). We also found that under steady-state conditions the catalytic conversion of heme to biliverdin by HO-1 was enhanced by 3.4-fold upon addition of a one tenth amount of H2O2 relative to O2 (supplemental Fig. S2). Single turnover experiments confirmed that such a small amount of H2O2 was sufficient to accelerate the verdoheme degradation step in the HO catalysis (supplemental Fig. S3). These results convincingly indicate that the verdoheme degradation by HO can be supported by H2O2 more efficiently than O2. In the absence of reductants, reaction of the verdoheme-HO-1 complex with H2O2 exhibited a kinetically well separated biphasic spectral change (Fig. 4B). The first reaction with isosbestic points at 369, 543, 603, and 725 nm shows accumulation of an intermediate species, termed H2O2-intermediate, having absorption maxima at 401 and 681 nm. While spectral features of the H2O2-intermediate are somewhat similar to those of the O2-intermediate (Figs. 3B and 4B), the reaction of verdoheme with O2 is much slower as noted above. Addition of NADPH/CPR or ascorbic acid to the H2O2-intermediate (at 30 s after the H2O2 injection) afforded biliverdin in 70% yield (Fig. 4, C and D) or the ferric biliverdin complex (data not shown), respectively. The H2O2-intermediate decayed slowly (within 60 min) to unknown product(s), which would not reduce to form biliverdin (Fig. 4C). Because of the good separation of the two phases (Fig. 4B, inset), the reaction rate constant of the verdoheme-HO-1 complex with H2O2 has been successfully determined to be 1.30 ± 0.1 × 104 M-1 s-1. This reactivity with H2O2 is essentially identical to the apparent rate constant of the H2O2-dependent verdoheme degradation (8.8 × 103 M-1 s-1) and 51-fold higher than the estimated reactivity with O2. These results clearly reveal that the verdoheme-HO-1 complex reacts with H2O2 to form the H2O2-intermediate whose reduction affords biliverdin via the ferric biliverdin complex. Verdoheme Degradation by Asp140 Mutants of HO-1—The verdoheme degradation by two Asp140 mutants of HO-1 was also examined. It has been reported that substitutions of Asp140 in the distal heme pocket of HO-1 to Ala and Phe completely inhibit the first step of the HO catalysis, meso-hydroxylation of heme (Fig. 1), without affecting the integrity of the overall structure of the heme-HO-1 complexes (25Fujii H.

Verdoheme complexes of D140A and D140F HO-1 exhibited essentially identical absorption spectra to that of the wild type; however, the Asp mutants showed ∼3–10-fold lower reactivity toward O2 and H2O2, although precise determination of their rates was not feasible due to a concomitant formation of non-biliverdin products (data not shown). D140A and especially D140F mutations caused significant decrease in the biliverdin yields both of the O2- and H2O2-dependent verdoheme degradation (TABLE ONE). Thus, Asp140 is likely to help the oxygen activation by the verdoheme, although its substitutions are not fatal. It should be noted that the biliverdin yield using O2 is very similar to that using H2O2 for each HO-1 enzyme (TABLE ONE). This observation implies a similar mechanism for the O2 and H2O2 reactions.TABLE ONEBiliverdin yield of wild type HO-1 and its Asp140 mutantsHO-1Biliverdin yieldaBiliverdin yields determined spectrophotometrically as a bilirubin-BSA complex are averaged values from at least three experiments.

Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5297-5307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the O2-dependent reaction, the verdoheme-HO-1 complex initially reacts with O2 to form a reaction intermediate, O2-intermediate, whose reduction yields biliverdin through the ferric biliverdin complex (Fig. 3). We also have found that H2O2 is an alternative to and more efficient oxygen source than O2 for the conversion of verdoheme to biliverdin by HO-1 (Fig. 4). Similar to the O2-dependent reaction, reaction of the verdoheme-HO-1 complex with H2O2 to form the H2O2-intermediate is followed by its reduction to the ferric biliverdin complex and biliverdin. Thus, the dual pathway of the verdoheme degradation by HO-1 can be summarized as shown in Fig. 5. The biliverdin formation in the O2- and H2O2-dependent reactions formally requires four and two electrons, respectively (13Saito S. Itano H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1393-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Indeed the H2O2 reaction consumes smaller amounts of NADPH for the biliverdin formation than the O2 reaction as judged from the NADPH absorbance decrease at 340 nm (Figs. 3A and 4A). Furthermore, the Asp140 substitutions significantly lowers biliverdin yields both in the O2- and H2O2-dependent reactions (TABLE ONE). These findings not only shed light on the reaction mechanism of the verdoheme degradation by HO but also provide biochemical and physiological implications for the HO catalysis. Direct Observation of the O2- and H2O2-intermediates—The present study reveals for the first time presence of a reaction intermediate in the O2-dependent verdoheme degradation by mammalian HO-1 (Fig. 3B). Careful examination is required to distinguish the O2-intermediate from its decomposed compound. Formation of the O2-intermediate causes slight shifts of absorption bands around 400 and 680 nm. Detection of the isosbestic points requires highly purified preparation of the verdoheme-HO-1 complex and a reproducible assay of its reaction. Because of the sluggish reactivity of the verdoheme-HO-1 complex with O2, the O2-intermediate formation is not kinetically separated well from its decomposition process (Fig. 3B, inset). The H2O2-intermediate is readily identified mainly due to the high reactivity of the verdoheme-HO-1 complex with H2O (1.30 × 104m-1 s-1; Fig. 4B, inset). Although it was reported that H2O2 did not react with a “verdoheme”-HO complex (3Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 543-549Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 18Wilks A.

Conversely, carcinomas (cancers of epithelial origin) represent three-dimensional disorganized multicellular masses in which cells are deprived of adhesion to the ECM but remain viable. Resistance of cancer cells to anoikis is thought to be critical for tumor progression. However, the knowledge about molecular mechanisms of this type of resistance remains limited. Herein we report that ras oncogene, an established inhibitor of anoikis, triggers a significant upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins cIAP2 and XIAP in intestinal epithelial cells. We also observed that the effect of ras on cIAP2 requires ras-induced autocrine production of transforming growth factor α (TGF-α), a ligand for epidermal growth factor receptor, whereas ras-triggered up-regulation of XIAP is TGF-α-independent. Moreover, overexpression of either cIAP2 or XIAP in nonmalignant intestinal epithelial cell was found to block anoikis. In addition, an established IAP antagonist Smac or Smac-derived cell-permeable peptide suppressed ras-induced anoikis resistance and subsequent anchorage-independent growth of ras-transformed cells. We conclude that ras-induced overexpression of cIAP2 and XIAP significantly contributes to the ability of ras-transformed intestinal epithelial cells to survive in the absence of adhesion to the ECM and grow in a three-dimensional manner.

This adhesion is believed to be critical for the continued survival of numerous types of normal epithelial cells.

Anoikis resistance of carcinoma cells is thought to represent a major prerequisite for cancer progression and, thus, may serve as a novel tumor-specific therapeutic target. However, relatively few efforts to exploit this property of malignant cells in the design of cancer treatment have been undertaken to date. This is mainly due to the fact that molecular mechanisms that block anoikis in cancer cells are understood only in part. As a consequence, potential targets for anoikis-promoting treatment of these cells are poorly defined. Those oncogene-dependent anti-anoikis mechanisms that have been identified so far involve some of the direct regulators of programmed cell death. Two major pathways are known to control apoptosis in mammalian cells. One of them involves the release of molecules such as cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, HTR-A2/Omi, and ARTS from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and subsequent activation of caspases (11Li P.

Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). Caspases can be inhibited by the members of the IAP family such as cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, ML-IAP, NAIP, and survivin (20Li F. J. Cell.

Upon release from the mitochondria, death-inducing proteins Smac/DIABLO, HTR-A2/Omi, and Arts inactivate the IAPs and trigger caspases (12Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

Conte D. Tamai K. Craig C.G. McBurney M.W. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The release of death-inducing factors from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm is facilitated by pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 protein family, such as Bax and Bak, and blocked by anti-apoptotic members of this family, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (17Olson M. Kornbluth S. Curr. Mol. Med. 2001; 1: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 24Adams J.M.

The second major apoptotic pathway is triggered because of the activation of members of the death receptor family, such as Fas, by their respective ligands, such as Fas ligand. Once engaged, death receptors activate initiator caspases-8 and -10 through an adapter molecule, FADD. This, in turn, results in the induction of effector caspases (26Locksley R.M. Killeen N.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). For example, we established that anoikis of non-malignant intestinal epithelial cells occurs due to the simultaneous induction of two pro-apoptotic signaling pathways. The first pathway involves detachment-induced down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL (6Rosen K. Coll M.L. Li A. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37273-37279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Coll M.L. Rosen K. Ladeda V. Filmus J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2908-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The second pathway is triggered by detachment-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and subsequent overexpression of Fas ligand (34Rosen K. Shi W. Calabretta B. Filmus J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46123-46130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Identification of some of the key pro-anoikis mechanisms allowed us to investigate which of these mechanisms may be altered in tumor cells by oncogenes, such as ras. Ras is a small GTPase activated by receptor-tyrosine kinases in response to various mitogenic signals (40Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Activated Ras, in turn, triggers multiple downstream pathways mediated by signaling molecules such as Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and Ral guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator among others. Some of these events frequently result in activation of transcription factors, such as NF-κB (40Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) and subsequent changes in the expression of their target genes. Ultimately, Ras-induced signaling mechanisms control proliferation, survival, motility, and other critical cellular functions (41Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activating mutations of ras are among the most frequently occurring oncogenic events in human cancer (42Bos J.L. Fearon E.R. Hamilton S.R. Verlaan-de Vries M. van Boom J.H. van der Eb A.J. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1987; 327: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 43Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar), including colorectal carcinoma. Thus far we found that oncogenic Ras blocks anoikis of intestinal epithelial cells by two mechanisms. One mechanism involves reversal of detachment-induced inhibition of Bcl-XL expression (33Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The second one is driven by Ras-induced down-regulation of Bak (44Rosen K. Rak J. Jin J. Kerbel R.S. Newman M.J. Filmus J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1331-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given that Ras has the ability to trigger multiple signaling pathways and, thus, change the expression and activity of numerous cellular proteins (41Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is highly likely that ras-induced anti-anoikis mechanisms are not limited to those regulated by Bak and Bcl-XL. We reasoned that, in addition to the Bcl-2 family members, other regulators of apoptosis, e.g. caspases and/or their inhibitors, such as the IAPs, could mediate the anti-anoikis effect of ras. The possibility of a role for caspases and the IAPs in ras-dependent anoikis resistance is supported by several observations. Thus, we and others showed that detachment of various types of epithelial cells results in the activation of initiator caspases-9, (31Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr.

An examination of the potential involvement of the IAPs in ras-dependent resistance to anoikis represented the main subject of this study. We now show that ras oncogene triggers up-regulation of cIAP2 and XIAP, two members of the IAP family, in intestinal epithelial cells and that the activity of these IAPs significantly contributes to ras-induced anoikis resistance. Cell Culture—The generation of the IEC clones expressing activated H-ras and antisense TGF-α has been previously described (1Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Erdos V. Huang S.N. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1587-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 54Filmus J. Shi W. Spencer T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1017-1022PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of H-ras in MT-ras cells was induced by adding 100 μm ZnCl2 and 2 μm CdCl2 to cells 48 h before the experiments involving the detection of cIAP2 or 24 h before the experiments involving the detection XIAP. All IEC clones were cultured in α-minimum essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 0.5% glucose. The DLD-1, DKS-8, and DKO-3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For suspension cultures cells were plated above a layer of 1% sea plaque-agarose polymerized in α-minimum essential medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Vectors—The generation of expression vectors carrying rat IAP-1 (rat analog of cIAP2) and mouse IAP-3 (mouse analog of XIAP) has been described elsewhere (55Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Hicks K.

Wang (Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas). Reagents—EGF receptor inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) was provided by AstraZeneca. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After removing the insoluble material, aliquots of supernatant containing 20–30 μg of protein were run through a 10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to a nylon membrane that was subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 625 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20) containing 4% skim milk. The membrane was incubated with one of the following antibodies: anti-RIAP1 (rat analog of cIAP2), anti-RIAP-3 (rat analog of XIAP) (the generation of these two antibodies has been described elsewhere (55Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Hicks K. Korneluk R.G. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-FLAG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Incubation with antibodies was performed in a TBST buffer containing 4% skim milk overnight. Binding of the antibodies was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was performed on total RNA. cDNAs coding for rat IAP-1 (rat analog of cIAP2) (55Holcik M. Lefebvre C.A. Hicks K. Korneluk R.G. BMC Genomics. 2002; 3: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and mouse IAP-3 (mouse analog of XIAP) (56Farahani R. Fong W.G. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A.E. Genomics. 1997; 42: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming were used as probes. Densitometric Analysis of Western and Northern Blots—Respective films were scanned, and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) was used for densitometric analysis of the resulting digital images. IAP-induced Survival Assay—5 × 105 IEC-18 cells grown in 60-mm dishes were incubated for 4 h with either 2 μg of pcDNA3 or 2 μg of RIAP-1 (rat analog of cIAP2) or mIAP-3 (mouse analog of XIAP) expression vector in the presence of 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (LF2000, Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) medium. The transfection mixture was subsequently replaced with regular IEC-18 medium, and the incubation was continued for another 24 h. 2 × 103 cells were further cultured in suspension for 15 h, re-plated in monolayers, and allowed to form colonies for 7 days. Colonies were then visualized by crystal violet staining and counted. Full-length Smac-induced Apoptosis Assay—5 × 105 ras-3 cells grown in 60-mm dishes were incubated for 4 h with either 2 μg of pcDNA3 or 2 μg of Smac expression vector in the presence of 0.4 μgof pEGFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech) and 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (LF2000, Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) medium. The transfection mixture was subsequently replaced with regular IEC-18 medium, and the incubation was continued for another 24 h. Cells were further plated in monolayer and suspension culture for 24 h. Cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and morphology of GFP-positive cells was then assessed by fluorescent microscopy. Condensed cells were scored as apoptotic. XIAP RNA Interference—5 × 105 ras-3 cells grown in 60-mm dishes were incubated for 17 h with either 100 nm control non-targeting siRNA (siCONTROL non-targeting siRNA 1, Dharmacon) or 100 nm XIAP-specific siRNA in the presence of 0.4 μg of pEGFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech) and 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (LF2000, Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) medium. The transfection mixture was subsequently replaced with regular IEC-18 medium, and the incubation was continued for another 30 h. Cells were further plated in monolayer and suspension culture for 24 h, trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and the morphology of GFP-positive cells was then assessed by fluorescent microscopy. Condensed cells were scored as apoptotic. The sequence of the sense strand of the XIAP siRNA1 was GCA GAUUUAUCAAUGGUUUUU. The sequence of the sense strand of the XIAP siRNA2 was GAAGGGACAAGAAUAUAUAUU. All siRNAs were from Dharmacon. Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay—3000 cells were suspended in 2 ml of IEC-18 medium (in case of ras-3 cells) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (in the case of DLD-1 cells) medium containing 0.3% of melted Bacto-agar. The resulting suspension was added to a 60-mm plate covered with a 2-ml layer of solidified 0.5% Bacto-agar in α-minimum essential medium or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively, in the presence of 80 μg/ml control or Smac peptide. Cell colonies (>50 cells) were allowed to form for 7–10 days and counted. The sequence of the Smac peptide was AVPIAQRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK. The penetratin sequence is underlined. The sequence of the control peptide was MVPIAQRQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK. Cell Death ELISA Assay—Cells growing in monolayer or suspension culture were removed from the plates and assayed for the presence of nucleosomal fragments in the cytoplasm by a cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oncogenic ras Triggers Up-regulation of cIAP2 and XIAP in Intestinal Epithelial Cells—In an effort to identify molecular mechanisms of ras-induced resistance to anoikis we compared the expression of anti-apoptotic protein cIAP2 in non-malignant highly anoikis-susceptible intestinal epithelial cells IEC-18 to that in ras-3, a previously published highly anoikis-resistant clone of IEC-18 cells stably expressing oncogenic H-ras (1Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Erdos V. Huang S.N. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1587-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, oncogenic ras triggers a noticeable increase in expression of cIAP2 in IEC-18 cells at the RNA level regardless of whether or not these cells are attached to the ECM (Fig. 1, A and B). ras-induced overexpression of cIAP2 was also observed at the protein level (Fig. 1C). To ensure that the differences in the efficiency of cIAP2 expression detected in IEC-18 and ras-3 cells do not represent the result of clonal variation, we compared cIAP2 protein levels between IEC-18 cells and ras-4, another previously published H-ras expressing clone of IEC-18 cells derived independently of ras-3 (1Rak J. Mitsuhashi Y. Erdos V. Huang S.N. Filmus J. Kerbel R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1587-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Similar to what was observed in the ras-3 clone, ras-4 cells displayed a significant increase in cIAP2 levels compared with the parental IEC-18 cells (Fig. 1C). To confirm that overexpression of cIAP2 is directly triggered by ras, we used a published clone of IEC-18 cells MT-ras carrying exogenous activated H-ras under the control of metallothionein promoter, which is inducible by Zn2+ and Cd2+ (33Rosen K. Rak J. Leung T. Dean N.M. Kerbel R.S. Filmus J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 57Filmus J. Robles A.I. Shi W. Wong M.J. Colombo L.L. Conti C.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3627-3633PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with what we observed in clones that expressed ras oncogene in a constitutive manner, we found that induction of ras in MT-ras cells leads to a noticeable up-regulation of cIAP2 (Fig. 1D). Conversely, control experiments demonstrated that treatment of the parental IEC-18 cells with Zn2+ and Cd2+ did not result in accumulation of this IAP (Fig. 1E). We further tested the effect of ras on XIAP, another established inhibitor of apoptosis, and found that ras triggers increased expression of this molecule at the RNA (Fig. 2, A and B) and protein (Fig. 2C) levels both in attached and detached cells (Fig. 2, A–C). We observed a similar effect of ras on XIAP in MT-ras cells (Fig. 2D) but not IEC-18 cells (Fig. 2E) in response to treatment with Zn2+ and Cd2+.FIGURE 2Activated H-ras triggers overexpression of XIAP in attached and detached intestinal epithelial cells. Attached (A) (att) and detached (B) (det) IEC-18 and ras-3 cells were assayed for the expression of XIAP by Northern blot.

https://openalex.org/W2000594342,"Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), a member of the metalloproteinase superfamily, is an important regulator of mammalian growth and development. However, the role of PAPP-A and its mechanism of action in various cellular processes remain unknown. In this study, we have investigated the role of PAPP-A in skeletal myogenesis using C2C12 myoblasts. Recombinant PAPP-A was purified from the conditioned medium of HT1080 cells overexpressing PAPP-A. Treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with PAPP-A increased their proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Addition of exogenous PAPP-A also increased the myotube formation and the activity of creatine kinase in C2C12 cultures. Transient overexpression of the full-length PAPP-A-(1-1547), but not truncated protease-inactive N-terminal PAPP-A-(1-920) or C-terminal PAPP-A-(1100-1547), significantly enhanced the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts. In vitro and in situ experiments demonstrated that PAPP-A cleaves insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-2, but not IGFBP-3, in the conditioned medium of C2C12 myoblasts. Overexpression of PAPP-A led to degradation of the IGFBP-2 produced by C2C12 myoblasts and increased free IGF-I concentrations without affecting total IGF-I concentrations. Addition of protease-resistant IGFBP-4 completely abolished the PAPP-A-induced proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts. Our results demonstrate that 1) PAPP-A increases the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts, 2) the stimulatory effect of PAPP-A on myogenesis is governed by its proteolytic activity, and 3) PAPP-A promotes skeletal myogenesis by increasing the amount of free IGFs via specific degradation of IGFBP-2 produced by myoblasts.

The physiological significance of IGFs in skeletal muscle development has been strongly supported by genetic studies that show that targeted disruption of the Igf-I gene in mice led to a dramatic decrease in both mass and function of skeletal muscles (5Liu J.P.

Conversely, overexpression of IGF-I in mice significantly increased muscle mass (7Mathews L.S. Hammer R.E. Behringer R.R. D'Ercole A.J. Bell G.I. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar).The actions of IGFs in vitro and in vivo are modulated by IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), which have high affinity and specificity for the IGFs (10Rosen C.J.

This suggests that changes in the rate of the synthesis or degradation of the inhibitory IGFBPs may play a pivotal role in the regulation of the myogenic actions of IGFs.Recent studies from our group and others have demonstrated that PAPP-A is a major protease that degrades IGFBP-4 (18Lawrence J.B. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Hays L.G. Yates J.R. II I Conover C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3149-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 19Qin X.

Sottrup-Jensen L. Giudice L.C. Conover C.A. Oxvig C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been shown that PAPP-A present in bovine and porcine follicular fluid can cleave IGFBP-2 (23Monget P. Mazerbourg S. Delpuech T. Maurel M.C. Maniere S. Zapf J. Lalmanach G. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These in vitro studies demonstrate that PAPP-A serves as a proteolytic enzyme for selected IGFBPs, namely, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-4, and IGFBP-5. Recently, the physiological significance of PAPP-A has been strongly supported by a study by Conover et al. (24Conover C.A. Bale L.K. Overgaard M.T. Johnstone E.W. Laursen U.H. Fuchtbauer E.M. Oxvig C. van Deursen J. Development. 2004; 131: 1187-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) that showed that PAPP-A and Igf-II knock-out mice exhibit similar phenotypes, characterized by a 40% reduction in birth weight and impaired bone development. Based on these in vitro and in vivo findings, we have proposed that PAPP-A may enhance the bioavailability of IGFs (the amount of free IGFs) by degrading selected IGFBPs, subsequently releasing IGFs from IGF·IGFBP complexes to act on target tissues.Although significant progress has been made toward biochemical characterization and identification of in vivo function of PAPP-A, the role and mechanisms of action of PAPP-A in various cellular processes, including myogenic differentiation, have not been determined. In addition to the protease domain, PAPP-A contains several other functional domains, such as the five complement control protein (CCP1-5) modules and two Lin12-Notch repeats (25Kristensen T. Oxvig C. Sand O. Moller N.P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1592-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the roles of these additional functional domains regarding PAPP-A function remain enigmatic. Using C2C12 cells (a mouse myoblast cell line), we have investigated the potential role, mechanism of action, and functional determinants of PAPP-A in myogenesis. Our data show that the stimulatory effect of PAPP-A on proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts is caused by increased IGF bioavailability, which occurs as a consequence of IGFBP-2 degradation. Furthermore, our results suggest that the proteolytic activity of PAPP-A is required for the induction of the myogenic program.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Invitrogen. The His6-tagged recombinant IGFBP-4 and amino acid 121-142-deleted IGFBP-4 peptides were prepared as previously described (26Sivanandam A.S. Mohan S. Kapur S. Kita H. Lau K.H. Bagi G. Baylink D.J.

Purified polyclonal anti-human PAPP-A IgG and normal IgG produced in rabbits were purchased from DAKO Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). Heparin-agarose was purchased from Bio-Rad. M2 FLAG antibody, M2 FLAG antibody-agarose, FLAG peptide, horse serum, and fetal calf serum (FCS) were from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal MF20 antibody specific to myosin heavy chain-fast twitch (MyHCf) protein was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank of the University of Iowa. Creatine kinase assay kit was obtained from Stanbio Laboratory (Boerne, TX). Recombinant human IGF-I and IGF-II were purchased from GroPep. Other chemicals and reagents were of reagent grade and were obtained from Sigma.Cell Culture—C2C12 and HT1080 cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts was induced by replacing the medium with differentiation medium (DM) (2% heat-inactivated horse serum in DMEM) for 96 h. All culture media were also supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.PAPP-A Expression Plasmids—Plasmids expressing the full-length PAPP-A-(1-1547), C-terminal PAPP-A-(1100-1547), and N-terminal PAPP-A-(1-920) were constructed in the pFLAG-CMV-1 vector (Sigma) as described previously (26Sivanandam A.S. Mohan S. Kapur S. Kita H. Lau K.H. Bagi G. Baylink D.J. Qin X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). When transfected into mammalian cells, these plasmids led to expression of N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged PAPP-A peptides.Purification of Recombinant Human PAPP-A—HT1080 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and co-transfected with linearized pcDNA3.1 vector (0.2 μg) and PAPP-A-(1-1547)/pFLAG plasmid DNA (2 μg). After 48 h, the cells were trypsinized and selected in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml). Expression of recombinant PAPP-A in G418-resistant HT1080 cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the conditioned medium (CM), using either PAPP-A or FLAG antibodies. Serum-free CM (200-400 ml) was collected from cultured HT1080/PAPP-A cells, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, adjusted to pH 7.5, and applied to a heparin-agarose affinity column (20 ml of resin). After washing the column with 150 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 300 mm NaCl, bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 1 m NaCl. Eluted proteins were concentrated with an Amicon filtration unit (10 kDa cutoff), diluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) to 150 mm NaCl, and applied to a M2 FLAG monoclonal antibody-agarose column (1 ml of resin). After washing the column with 30 ml of Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, bound proteins were eluted with 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). FLAG peptides (<1 kDa) in the purified PAPP-A were removed by an Amicon filtration device (100 kDa cutoff) with extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Purified PAPP-A was quantitated by Bradford reagents using bovine serum albumin as standard and stored at -75 °C in aliquots.Proliferation Assay—Proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts was measured using AlamarBlue dye, which measures the metabolic activity of live cells, as described previously (27Miyakoshi N. Richman C. Kasukawa Y. Linkhart T.A. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). C2C12 myoblasts were seeded in DMEM/10% FCS in 24-well plates (10,000 cells/well). After 12-24 h of incubation, the cells were washed once with DMEM and starved in serum-free DMEM for an additional 12-24 h prior to addition of effectors in DMEM containing 5% FCS unless specified. After an appropriate length of incubation, the CM was removed, and 0.5 ml (for 24-well plates) or 1 ml (for 6-well plates) of 10% AlamarBlue (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) in phenol red-free DMEM was added to each well. After 1-2 h of incubation, 0.2-ml reaction from each well was used to determine fluorescence at the optimal excitation and emission wave-lengths of 546 and 590 nm, respectively. The proliferation of myoblasts was also confirmed by measuring the total protein content in cell lysates.Myogenic Index Determination—As a morphological parameter of muscle differentiation, the myogenic index is defined as the number of nuclei residing in the cells containing three or more nuclei, divided by the total number of nuclei in hematoxylin-stained cells. Cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were then stained with hematoxylin for 20 s followed by washing in running water. Distribution of nuclei in myoblasts and myotubes was measured by counting the nuclei at 7-10 different locations selected randomly using an inverted microscope with counting grid (Olympus).Immunocytochemistry—Expression of MyHCf was examined by immunocytochemistry. C2C12 myoblasts were grown in a 24-well plate and were allowed to differentiate into myotubes. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton-X-100 as described above. After being washed three times (3 min each) with PBS, the cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h and then incubated with MF-20 antibody (specific to MyHCf) at 1:100 dilutions in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS, incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa546 at a 1:100 dilution for 1 h, and counterstained for nuclei with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min. Stained cells were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX 70). Pictures were captured using Olympus MagnaFire Digital Camera and software.Creatine Kinase Assay—Creatine kinase activity was measured to assess myogenic differentiation biochemically. Following treatment with recombinant PAPP-A, cells were washed twice in cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer A (50 Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3% IPEGAL). Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm, and the supernatant collected was used immediately for creatine kinase assay. Protein content in the samples was measured using Bradford reagent. Creatine kinase activity was measured using a spectrophotometrically based kit (Stanbio Laboratory, Boerne, TX). Specific creatine kinase activity was calculated after correction for total protein and expressed as units/mg protein.Miscellaneous Procedures—Western immunoblot analysis of PAPP-A using either FLAG antibody or PAPP-A antibody was performed as described previously (26Sivanandam A.S.

Yoo M. Sexton C. Baylink D.J. Qin X. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Free IGF-I concentrations in the CM samples were determined by a commercial kit using 50 μl of CM (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, Texas). Total IGF-I concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay (29Mohan S. Libanati C. Dony C. Lang K. Srinivasan N. Baylink D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 80: 2638-2645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. and statistically analyzed by Student's t-test or analysis of variance. A value of p <0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSHere we have investigated the role and mechanisms by which PAPP-A modulates skeletal myogenesis. Because the major muscle differentiation steps can be reproduced in vitro with the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 (30Tomczak K.K. Marinescu V.D. Ramoni M.F. Sanoudou D. Montanaro F. Han M.

Genomics. 2003; 82: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we used C2C12 myoblasts to investigate the role of PAPP-A in myogenesis.Purification of Recombinant PAPP-A Peptide—Development of an efficient procedure to produce and purify recombinant PAPP-A peptide is crucial to study cellular responses. We employed the two-step purification protocol (described under “Experimental Procedures”) that has been shown to remove both contaminating proteins and PAPP-A proteolytic fragments, as heparin antibody and FLAG antibody bind to the distal C-terminal region and N terminus of recombinant PAPP-A, respectively (26Sivanandam A.S.

Assessment of PAPP-A purity by Coomassie Blue staining revealed the presence of a major single band (Fig. 1A) with the expected molecular mass (∼400 kDa). Immunoblot analyses using either polyclonal PAPP-A antibody (Fig. 1B) or monoclonal FLAG antibody (Fig. 1C) demonstrate that the purified PAPP-A peptide contains insignificantly low amounts of PAPP-A proteolytic fragments.To determine the activity of the purified recombinant PAPP-A, we performed protease assays using IGFBP-4 as a substrate. Purified PAPP-A effectively cleaved the wild-type IGFBP-4 (WT-BP4) at a rate of ∼20 ng of IGFBP-4/ng PAPP-A/h under defined conditions. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 1D, PAPP-A was unable to cleave the protease-resistant IGFBP-4 analog (PR-BP4) lacking a broad sequence (amino acids 121-142) containing the cleavage site (Met-135-Lys-136) (33Qin X. Byun D. Strong D.D. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2079-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous published reports (21Byun D. Mohan S. Yoo M.

Conover C.A. Oxvig C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), purified recombinant PAPP-A peptide also effectively cleaved IGFBP-5 (data not shown).PAPP-A Stimulates Proliferation of C2C12 Myoblasts—Because C2C12 myoblasts cultured at low cell density in serum-free medium underwent severe apoptosis and did not proliferate, the stimulatory effect of PAPP-A on cell proliferation was less pronounced under serum-free conditions (data not shown). Therefore, we subsequently used 5% FCS medium to study the effect of PAPP-A on cellular proliferation. As shown in Fig. 2A, treatment with PAPP-A increased the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts in a dose-dependent manner with maximum effect observed at a concentration of 100 ng/ml PAPP-A. Furthermore, the cellular proliferation peaked after 72 h of PAPP-A treatment (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Effect of PAPP-A on the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts. Cellular proliferation was first determined by AlamarBlue assay, followed by quantitation of cellular proteins by Bradford reagent in the cell lysates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, C2C12 myoblasts were cultured for 48 h in DMEM containing 5% FCS and varying amounts of purified recombinant PAPP-A protein. The data presented here show that PAPP-A treatment increases the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts in a dose-dependent manner (*, p <0.05 versus untreated control and #, p <0.05 versus untreated control). B, C2C12 myoblasts were seeded in 24-well plates (10,000 cells/well) and treated with PAPP-A (100 ng/ml). After PAPP-A treatment, cellular proliferation was measured at the indicated time points. The data show that the maximum proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts was noticed after 72 h of PAPP-A treatment (@, p <0.05 versus 0 h).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PAPP-A Promotes Differentiation of C2C12 Myoblasts into Myotubes—The effect of PAPP-A on differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts was examined. C2C12 myoblasts were incubated in DM (DMEM/2% heat-inactivated horse serum) with or without 100 ng/ml PAPP-A. Myoblasts cultured in growth medium (DMEM/10% FCS) were included as a negative control for myogenic differentiation. After 96 h, myotube formation in C2C12 cultures was studied by immunostaining for MyHCf protein. No fusion of myoblasts into myotubes was observed in C2C12 myoblasts incubated in GM (Fig. 3A, left panel). Incubation of C2C12 myoblasts in DM led to formation of myotubes expressing MyHCf (Fig. 3A, middle panel, arrow). Interestingly, the size and the number of myotubes in C2C12 cultures were significantly increased with PAPP-A treatment (Fig. 3A, right panel, arrow).FIGURE 3PAPP-A increases the differentiation of C2C12 myoblast. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in growth medium (GM, left panel) or differentiation medium (DM) in the absence (middle panel) or in the presence (right panel) of 100 ng/ml purified recombinant PAPP-A for 96 h. A, cells were labeled with MyHCf-specific MF-20 antibody and then subjected to nuclear staining as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data presented here show an increased number and size of myotubes in PAPP-A-treated C2C12 cultures as compared with untreated cultures (arrows indicate the difference in the size of myotubes). B, the myogenic index (percentage of total nuclei associated with myotubes) was significantly higher in the PAPP-A-treated C2C12 cultures as compared with the C2C12 cultures incubated in DM alone (*, p <0.05 versus control). C, creatine kinase (CK) activity measured in cell lysates after adjustment for protein concentrations was also significantly higher in PAPP-A-treated C2C12 cultures compared with the untreated C2C12 cultures (#, p <0.05 versus control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The myogenic index (the fraction of total nuclei residing in cells containing ≥3 nuclei in hematoxylin-stained C2C12 cultures) was also determined in a separate experiment. A significant increase in myogenic index was observed in PAPP-A-treated C2C12 cultures compared with control C2C12 cultures incubated in DM alone (Fig. 3B). Additionally, treatment of C2C12 myoblasts with PAPP-A significantly increased the activity of creatine kinase (Fig. 3C), an important biochemical marker for myogenic differentiation (34Langen R.C. Schols A.M. Kelders M.C. Wouters E.F. Janssen-Heininger Y.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1169-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).Overexpression of PAPP-A in C2C12 Myoblasts Promotes Their Proliferation and Differentiation—Based on our assessment of the purity of our recombinant PAPP-A protein (Fig. 1), it is unlikely that the observed effects of PAPP-A on myoblasts result from other contaminating growth factors possibly co-purified with PAPP-A. To completely rule out this possibility, we determined whether direct overexpression of PAPP-A in C2C12 myoblasts could also promote their proliferation and differentiation. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with 2 μg of either empty pFLAG vector DNA or PAPP-A/pFLAG plasmid DNA. Transfected C2C12 myoblasts were then cultured in either DMEM/5%FCS to study cellular proliferation or in DM to study differentiation. Expression of PAPP-A was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the CM with FLAG antibody (Fig. 4, A and C). It was estimated that the concentration of PAPP-A in the CM of PAPP-A/pFLAG-transfected C2C12 myoblasts ranged from 75 to 200 ng/ml, similar to the concentration of recombinant PAPP-A used in prior experiments (Fig. 2). Consistent with results from experiments using exogenously added recombinant PAPP-A (Fig. 2), overexpression of PAPP-A in C2C12 myoblasts significantly increased their proliferation (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, overexpression of PAPP-A in C2C12 myoblasts enhanced their differentiation, evident by increased specific creatine kinase activity (Fig. 4D).FIGURE 4Transient overexpression of PAPP-A increases myoblast proliferation and differentiation. C2C12 myoblasts were transfected with 2 μg/well of either pFLAG empty vector DNA or PAPP-A/pFLAG plasmid DNA. The production of recombinant PAPP-A after transfection in each experiment was measured in culture supernatants and quantified using purified protein (A and C). After 16 h of transfection, the medium was replaced with either DMEM containing 5% fetal calf serum (for proliferation assay) or 2% horse serum (for differentiation study). The proliferation of myoblasts was studied using AlamarBlue dye, whereas the differentiation was monitored by assaying the creatine kinase (CK) activity. The data presented here show an increase in the proliferation (*, p <0.05 versus vector alone) (B) and the differentiation (#, p <0.05 versus vector alone) (D) in PAPP-A-transfected C2C12 cultures as compared with C2C12 cultures transfected with vector alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Proteolytic Activity of PAPP-A Is Required for Its Stimulatory Effect on Myoblast Proliferation—Studies were performed to investigate whether the myogenic activity of PAPP-A is determined by its proteolytic activity or is due to other potential functional domains (25Kristensen T.

HIF-1α, a subunit of HIF-1, is rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions by the ubiquitin-proteosome system. Hypoxia up-regulates HIF-1α by inhibiting its degradation, thereby allowing it to accumulate to high levels with 3–6 h of hypoxia treatment and decreasing thereafter. In vascular tissues, prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2 (PGI2)) is a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation and is known as a vasoprotective molecule. However, the role of PGI2 in HIF-1 activation has not been studied. In the present study, we investigated the effect of PGI2 on HIF-1 regulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells under prolonged hypoxia (12 h). Augmentation of PGI2 via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of both cyclooxygenase-1 and PGI2 synthase activated HIF-1 by stabilizing HIF-1α in cells under prolonged hypoxia or the hypoxia-normoxia transition but not under normoxia. Exogenous H2O2 abolished PGI2- and catalase-induced HIF-1α up-regulation, which suggests that degradation of HIF-1α under prolonged hypoxia is through a reactive oxygen species-dependent pathway. Moreover, PGI2 attenuated NADPH oxidase activity by suppressing Rac1 and p47phox expression under hypoxia.

Various redox-dependent signaling pathways for oxygen sensing and HIF-1α stabilization have been proposed.

It is synthesized by a series of enzymatic reactions whereby cytosolic phospholipase A2 cleaves arachidonic acid from phospholipids, cyclooxygenase (COX) converts arachidonic acid to PGH2, and PGI2 synthase (PGIS) catalyzes PGH2 to PGI2 (21Smith W.L. Marnett L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1083: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 22Wu K.K. Agents Actions Suppl. 1995; 45: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar). Two COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) have been identified. COX-1 is constitutively expressed, whereas COX-2 is inducible (22Wu K.K. Agents Actions Suppl. 1995; 45: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mardini I.A. Kapoor S. Lawson J.A. FitzGerald G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that overexpression of both COX-1 and PGIS by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer can selectively increase PGI2 production in endothelial cells without a concurrent overproduction of other prostanoids (25Shyue S.K. Tsai M.J. Liou J.Y. Willerson J.T. Wu K.K. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Lin H. Lin T.N. Cheung W.M. Nian G.M. Tseng P.H. Chen S.F. Chen J.J. Shyue S.K. Liou J.Y. Wu C.W. Wu K.K. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1962-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the effect of PGI2 on HIF-1α regulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under prolonged hypoxia. PGI2 up-regulated HIF-1α under prolonged hypoxia via down-regulating ROS production. This finding demonstrates a novel function of PGI2 and sheds light on the regulatory mechanism of HIF-1α under prolonged hypoxia. Cell Culture—HUVECs in passages 3–5 were isolated from freshly obtained umbilical veins and cultured in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C as described previously (25Shyue S.K. Tsai M.J. Liou J.Y. Willerson J.T. Wu K.K. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hypoxia culture was in a gas-controlled chamber (Forma Scientific) maintained at 1% oxygen, 94% N2, and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. PGE2 and iloprost were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Cyclohexamine (10 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) was added before the cells were exposed to normoxia, and MG132 (10 μm) was added 2 h before the cells were exposed to normoxia. Recombinant Adenovirus Preparation—Recombinant adenoviruses containing a human phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter and a polyadenylation signal of bovine growth hormone were constructed by homologous recombination in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection CRL number 1573) as described previously (25Shyue S.K. Tsai M.J. Liou J.Y. Willerson J.T. Wu K.K. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses carrying both COX-1 and PGIS (Ad-COP1) and catalase (Ad-catalase) were prepared as described previously (26Lin H. Lin T.N. Cheung W.M. Nian G.M. Tseng P.H. Chen S.F. Chen J.J. Shyue S.K.

Cardiol. 2004; 36: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The adenovirus with no insert, Ad-PGK, was used as a control. HUVECs were infected with recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (plaque-forming unit/cell) of 25 for 48 h for all experiments. 6-Keto-PGF1αMeasurement—Cells were cultured in a 35-mm dish. Levels of 6-keto-PGF1α were measured by enzymatic immunoassay (RPN221, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting—Nuclear extracts of HUVECs were prepared as described previously (9Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). A total of 30 μg of cell lysate or nuclear extract was resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (25Shyue S.K. Tsai M.J. Liou J.Y. Willerson J.T. Wu K.K. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Antiserums of PGIS (25Shyue S.K. Tsai M.J. Liou J.Y. Willerson J.T. Wu K.K. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), COX-1, lamin A/C, HIF-1α, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were diluted to 1:2000 and that of β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to 1:6000. Luciferase Reporter Assay—An HRE reporter construct, pHRE-Luc, was prepared as follows. The luciferase gene was excised from pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and cloned into an HRE-cytomegalovirus vector (a gift of Dr. L. Y. Chau, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan), which contains 4 HREs and a minimal cytomegalovirus promoter. pRL-tk, which carries a Renilla gene, was used as an internal control of transfection. Transfection was conducted by 15 ml of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 10 μg of DNA in a 35-mm dish. The transfection efficiency was ∼18% by transfection of pEGFP-N1, and the fraction of enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing cells was measured by flow cytometry. HUVECs were co-transfected with pHRE-Luc and pRL-tk, infected with Ad-PGK or Ad-COP1 at a multiplicity of infection of 25, and cultured in complete medium for 48 h. The cells were then exposed to normoxic or hypoxic conditions. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed, and luciferase activity was measured with the use of luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Relative promoter activity was measured by the ratio of luciferase to Renilla activity. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and Real-time PCR—RNA of HUVECs was isolated by the TRIzol RNA isolation system (Invitrogen). A total of 1.5 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with oligo(dT) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNAs were used for PCR amplification with the primers 5′-TGCCAAGTGGTCCCAG-3′ and 5′-GTGAGGTTTGATCCGC-3′ for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, 277 bp) and 5′-GTTTACTAAAGGACAAGTCACC-3′ and 5′-TTCTGTTTGTTGAAGGGAG-3′ for HIF-1α (193 bp). PCR of β-actin was used as a reference with the primers 5′-GGGRCAGAAGGATTCCTATG-3′ and 5′-GGTCTCAAACATGATCTGGG-3′ (238 bp). The regimen of RT-PCR amplification was as follows: 5 cycles of 95 °C for 40 s, 58 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 40 s followed by 20 cycles of 95 °C for 40 s, 55 °C for 40 s, and 72 °C for 40 s for VEGF. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed in a 10-ml reaction volume by the standard protocols of the Roche Applied Science LightCycler system under the regimen of 40 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 52 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s for HIF-1α. The relative gene expression was obtained by ΔCT assay (ΔCT = CT (Target gene) – CTβ-actin). All reactions were performed in triplicates and normalized by reference gene expression. HIF-1α-pVHL Co-immunoprecipitation—Nuclear extracts of HUVECs (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 5 μg of HIF-1α antiserum in a 500-μl reaction, as described previously (28Liou J.Y. Deng W.G. Gilroy D.W. Shyue S.K. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34975-34982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A total of 60 μg of precipitated protein of each sample was used for Western blot analysis with pVHL antiserum (diluted 1:1000; BD Biosciences). ROS Measurement—Intracellular ROS generation was assessed with use of 2′,7′–dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular probes, Eugene, OR). ROS in cells causes oxidation of 2′,7′–dichlorofluorescein diacetate, yielding the fluorescent product 2′,7′–dichlorofluorescein. The cells were cultured in medium containing 2′,7′–dichlorofluorescein diacetate (10 μmol/liter) for 30 min. The medium was then removed, cells were lysed and centrifuged, and the level of 2′,7′–dichlorofluorescein in the supernatant was measured with the use of a spectrophotometer at an excitation:emission ratio of 488:525 nm. NADPH Oxidase Activity Assay—Cells were suspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) containing 1 mmol/1 EDTA, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.0. NADPH (100 μmol/liter) (Sigma) and cytochrome c (40 μmol/liter) (Sigma) were added into 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing samples of 5 mg of protein with or without Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) (200 units/ml) (Sigma) and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. The O–2-dependent cytochrome c reduction was calculated from the difference of absorbance at 550 nm between samples incubated with and without SOD (ϵ550, reduced–oxidized = 21.1 nmol/liter–1cm–1). Statistical Analysis—Unpaired Student's t test was used for comparisons between treatments, and data are expressed as mean ± S.E. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Effect of PGI2 on HIF-1α Regulation in HUVECs Exposed to Hypoxia—HUVECs were infected with an adenovirus carrying both COX-1 and PGIS, Ad-COP1, at a multiplicity of infection of 25 for 48 h. Western blot analysis showed both COX-1 and PGIS protein levels highly increased in Ad-COP1-infected cells compared with cells mock-infected with Ad-PGK under both hypoxia and normoxia (Fig. 1, A and B). The level of 6-keto-PGF1α, a stable hydrolyzed product of PGI2, in Ad-COP1-infected cells was augmented to ∼10× that in mock-infected and control cells (Fig. 1C). To examine the effect of PGI2 on HIF-1α regulation, HUVECs were infected with Ad-PGK or Ad-COP1 and exposed to hypoxia for 3–15 h. HIF-1α was up-regulated in cells exposed to hypoxia for 3–9 h but not in cells exposed to normoxia (Fig. 2A). In control cells, HIF-1α levels were down-regulated to a very low level at 12 and 15 h. Surprisingly, HIF-1α was significantly up-regulated in cells infected with Ad-COP1 under hypoxia for 12 and 15 h (Fig. 2, A and B). Up-regulation of HIF-1α was also detected in cells treated with iloprost, a stable analogue of PGI2 (Fig. 2B), whereas exogenous PGE2 did not alter HIF-1α expression (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2Stabilization of HIF-1α by elevated PGI2 and iloprost in HUVECs under prolonged hypoxia. HUVECs were infected with Ad-PGK or Ad-COP1 and exposed to normoxia (N) or hypoxia for 3 (H3) to 15 h (H15) (A–C) in the absence or presence of iloprost (200 nmol/liter) (B) or PGE2 (100 μmol/liter) (C), respectively. Levels of HIF-1α in nuclear extract were determined by Western blot (A–C) and densitometric analysis (B). Data are means ± S.E. (n = 3 or as indicated). **, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) HIF-1 activity was measured by HRE reporter assay in HUVECs transfected with pHRE-Luc and infected with Ad-PGK or Ad-COP1. Ad-COP1 infection did not up-regulate HIF-1 activity in HUVECs under normoxia (Fig. 3A). However, the activity was increased in control cells exposed to hypoxia for 12 h and further up-regulated in cells infected with Ad-COP1. Because HIF-1 is the major mediator of VEGF up-regulation, augmented transactivation activity of HIF-1 was also supported by RT-PCR results showing the VEGF mRNA level up-regulated in Ad-COP1-infected cells as compared with Ad-PGK-infected cells (Fig. 3B). These data imply that augmentation of PGI2 up-regulates HIF-1 activity in HUVECs under prolonged hypoxia. To investigate whether HIF-1α up-regulation was through gene transactivation or protein stabilization, real-time PCR revealed that HIF-1α mRNA levels did not significantly differ between cells infected with Ad-PGK and those with Ad-COP1 (Fig. 3C). Thus, up-regulation of HIF-1α by PGI2 is through protein stabilization but not DNA transactivation. PGI2 Stabilizes HIF-1α in HUVECs Treated with Hypoxia and Then Normoxia—Because HIF-1α is rapidly degraded through a proteosome pathway in cells exposed to hypoxia and then normoxia (5Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar), HUVECs were incubated under hypoxia for 6 h and then exposed to normoxia for 15–120 min to investigate whether PGI2 stabilizes HIF-1α in such cells. Western blot analysis showed that HIF-1α in Ad-PGK-infected cells was degraded to a very low level in cells exposed to hypoxia and then normoxia for 15 and 30 min (Fig. 4A). However, a significant amount of HIF-1α was detected in cells infected with Ad-COP1 exposed to hypoxia and then normoxia for up to 60 min, markedly reduced at 90 min, and down-regulated to a very low level at 120 min (Fig. 4B). A similar effect was identified in Ad-COP1-infected cells treated with cyclohexamine, a translational inhibitor, that a high level of HIF-1α was detected at 45 min, gradually decreased at 60 and 90 min, and down-regulated to a very low level at 120 min (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that overexpression of both COX-1 and PGIS prolongs HIF-1α stability in the hypoxia-normoxia transition. Interaction of pVHL with HIF-1α was investigated by co-immunoprecipitation of HIF-1α and pVHL. Ad-COP1 infection abolished the interaction of pVHL with HIF-1α in cells exposed to prolonged hypoxia and in control cells exposed to hypoxia for 6 h, whereas high levels of pVHL protein co-immunoprecipitated with HIF-1α in control and Ad-PGK-infected cells (Fig. 4D). Because pVHL mediated HIF-1α degradation, this result suggests that Ad-COP1 infection abolishes pVHL interaction with HIF-1α and, hence, inhibits its degradation. Stabilization of HIF-1α by PGI2 Is ROS-dependent—To determine whether stabilization of HIF-1α is related to the ROS signal, we found that exogenous H2O2 abolished the PGI2 effect on HIF-1α up-regulation (Fig. 5A), whereas HIF-1α was up-regulated in cells infected with Ad-catalase (Fig. 5B). Moreover, HIF-1α levels were not altered by H2O2 or catalase overexpression in cells under normoxia. Thus, under prolonged hypoxia, HIF-1α degradation is signaled by ROS and can be stabilized by reduction of endogenous H2O2 by catalase. To examine whether PGI2 attenuates ROS production, as implied above, HUVECs infected with Ad-PGK or Ad-COP1 were exposed to hypoxia and their ROS levels measured. As shown in Fig. 5C, ROS levels were increased in Ad-PGK-infected cells exposed to hypoxia for 6 h, further elevated in control cells under hypoxia for 12 h, and markedly attenuated in Ad-COP1-infected and iloprost-treated cells, whereas Ad-COX-1 infection did not alter the ROS level. These results suggest an antioxidant effect of PGI2 under hypoxia but not normoxia. To examine whether the antioxidant effect of PGI2 was through up-regulation of SOD or catalase, Western blot analysis showed that Ad-COP1 infection did not significantly alter SOD and catalase levels under prolonged hypoxia (Fig. 5, D and E). Measurement of ROS generation in cells exposed to the hypoxia-normoxia transition showed significant up-regulation in control cells exposed to normoxia for 15 min and a further increase at a longer incubation (Fig. 6A). However, Ad-COP1 infection markedly attenuated the up-regulation of ROS in cells exposed to normoxia for 15–30 min, which was slightly increased at 60 min and up-regulated to a higher level at 120 min. To investigate whether reduction of ROS stabilized HIF-1α in cells exposed to hypoxia and then normoxia for 90 and 120 min, infection of Ad-catalase further attenuated ROS production in cells exposed to the hypoxia-normoxia transition (Fig. 6A), which resulted in up-regulation of HIF-1α in cells exposed to hypoxia and then normoxia for 90 and 120 min (Fig. 6B). Moreover, MG132, a proteosome inhibitor, up-regulated HIF-1α in the hypoxia-normoxia transition (Figs. 4, B and C; and 6B), which confirms that HIF-1α down-regulation is through a proteosome degradation pathway. PGI2 Attenuated NADPH Oxidase Activity—Because NADPH oxidase is one of the major sources of ROS in HUVECs, we examined whether augmentation of PGI2 suppressed NADPH oxidase activity in HUVECs under prolonged hypoxia. As shown in Fig. 7A, Ad-COP1 infection reduced NADPH oxidase activity in HUVECs as compared with cells infected with the control virus under normoxic conditions. Surprisingly, under prolonged hypoxia, NADPH oxidase activity was markedly attenuated to a very low level in cells infected with Ad-COP1, which supports the antioxidant effect of PGI2 shown in Figs. 5C and 6A. For an unknown reason, NADPH oxidase activity was reduced in cells infected with the control virus under prolonged hypoxia. Moreover, HIF-1α expression was not affected in cells treated with exogenous diphenylene iodonium, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, and exposed to normoxia or hypoxia for 6 h (Fig. 7B). However, under prolonged hypoxia, HIF-1α was significantly up-regulated in such cells and in those infected with Ad-COP1 (Fig. 7B). Thus, inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity up-regulates HIF-1α in HUVECs under prolonged hypoxia. To investigate the molecular mechanism of NADPH oxidase attenuation by PGI2, protein levels of NADPH oxidase subunits were analyzed by Western blotting in cells exposed to prolonged hypoxia. p67phox was up-regulated under hypoxia, and infection with Ad-COP1 significantly suppressed the up-regulation (Fig. 8A). The p67phox level in Ad-COP1-infected cells was similar to that in cells under normoxia, which implies that regulation of p67phox does not contribute to marked attenuation of NADPH oxidase activity (Fig. 7A). In addition, p47phox and Rac1 were markedly down-regulated in cells infected with Ad-COP1 as compared with those infected with Ad-PGK (Fig. 8, B and C). These data suggest that PGI2 attenuates NADPH oxidase activity by down-regulating Rac1 and p47phox in HUVECs infected with Ad-COP1 under prolonged hypoxia. In the cardiovascular system, the up-regulation of HIF-1 activates VEGF and many other genes, which may protect endothelial cells or surrounding organs by promoting angiogenesis, anti-apoptosis (29Kumar P. Miller A.I. Polverini P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43352-43360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and cell proliferation (30Golpon H.A. Fadok V.A. Taraseviciene-Stewart L. Scerbavicius R. Sauer C. Welte T. Henson P.M. Voelkel N.F. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1716-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a novel function of PGI2 in down-regulating ROS production and activating HIF-1 by stabilizing HIF-1α under prolonged hypoxia in HUVECs. Fig. 9 delineates the model of PGI2 function and is supported by the major new findings of this study. 1) Overexpression of COX-1 and PGIS via adenovirus-mediated gene transfer augments PGI2 production, which stabilizes HIF-1α in cells under prolonged hypoxia and hypoxia followed by normoxia. 2) Stabilization of HIF-1α by PGI2 or Ad-catalase infection is mediated through reduction of ROS production under prolonged hypoxia. 3) PGI2 attenuates NADPH oxidase activity by suppressing Rac1 and p47phox expression under prolonged hypoxia. Although antisense HIF-1α has been suggested to down-regulate HIF-1α in A549 cells exposed to prolonged hypoxia (6Uchida T. Rossignol F. Matthay M.A. Mounier R. Couette S. Clottes E. Clerici C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14871-14878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), our data suggest a different regulatory mechanism, because the mRNA level of HIF-1α was not altered (Fig. 3C). Up-regulation of ROS by hypoxia or the hypoxia-normoxia transition was associated with HIF-1α degradation, which was attenuated by PGI2 production, catalase overexpression, or exogenous diphenylene iodonium. These results indicate that up-regulation of ROS mediates HIF-1α degradation in such conditions, which explains why exogenous H2O2 pretreatment suppressed HIF-1α stabilization in cells exposed to hypoxia for 8 h (11Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Although NADPH oxidase activity was not up-regulated under hypoxia, increased ROS levels might be generated by the complex III of mitochondria (17Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). In addition, diphenylene iodonium has no effect on HIF-1α expression in cells under normoxia or 6-h hypoxia (Fig. 7B), which implies that HIF-1α up-regulation in HUVECs exposed to hypoxia for 6 h is not mediated through suppression of NADPH oxidase activity. Conversely, up-regulation of HIF-1α by accumulated H2O2 has been reported in immortalized JunD–/– cells via suppression of PGIS and other antioxidant gene expression, as well as transactivation of NADPH oxidase 4 (18Gerald D. Berra E. Frapart Y.M. Chan D.A. Giaccia A.J. Mansuy D. Pouyssegur J. Yaniv M. Mechta-Grigoriou F. Cell. 2004; 118: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Moreover, HIF-1α stabilization by Ad-COP1 infection was not detected in human lung cancer (H1299) and hepatoma (HepG2) cells under prolonged hypoxia (data not shown). These data indicate a differential regulatory effect of ROS in endothelial and tumor cells and suggest a cell type-dependent regulation of HIF-1α. Because NADPH oxidase is one of the major sources of ROS in endothelial cells, inhibition of ROS production reduces oxidative products, such as oxidized low density lipoprotein, and their damage is related to atherosclerosis and cell apoptosis (27Lin S.J. Shyue S.K. Liu P.L. Chen Y.H. Ku H.H. Chen J.W. Tam K.B. Chen Y.L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2004; 36: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, up-regulation of VEGF might have a protective effect in inhibiting atherogenesis and cardiovascular damage (31Kolsut P. Malecki M. Zelazny P. Teresinska A. Firek B. Janik P. Religa Z. Kardiol. Pol. 2003; 59: 373-384PubMed Google Scholar). Transactivation of VEGF by HIF-1 because of PGI2 augmentation may increase angiogenesis around the hypoxic region to increase blood and nutritional supply and protect cells from hypoxic damage. These data suggest an important role for PGI2 in the cardiovascular system, not only as a potent vasoprotective molecule to cause vasodilatation and reduce platelet and monocyte activation but also to attenuate ROS production and enhance angiogenesis in endothelial cells under hypoxia. This function may be related to the deleterious effect of COX-2-selective inhibitors, which suppress PGI2 production and increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke (32Mukherjee D. Nissen S.E. Topol E.J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 286: 954-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar, 33FitzGerald G.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 1709-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In addition, hypoxia and a constitutively active form of HIF-1α markedly induces COX-1 and PGIS expression in endothelial cells (4Manalo D.J. Rowan A. Lavoie T. Natarajan L. Kelly B.D. Ye S.Q. Garcia J.G. Semenza G.L. Blood. 2005; 105: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) and up-regulates PGI2 production in the ischemic brain (26Lin H. Lin T.N. Cheung W.M. Nian G.M. Tseng P.H. Chen S.F. Chen J.J. Shyue S.K. Liou J.Y. Wu C.W. Wu K.K. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1962-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which suggests a positive feedback regulation of HIF-1α and an important role of PGI2 under hypoxia. Moreover, although PGI2 may stabilize the HIF-1α in the endothelial cells of tumors under ischemia and enhance angiogenesis, the PGIS promoter was shown to be hypermethylated and its expression suppressed in colorectal cancers and cell lines (34Frigola J. Munoz M. Clark S.J. Moreno V. Capella G. Peinado M.A. Oncogene. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar), therefore the function of PGI2 in tumorigenesis remains unclear. Under physiological conditions, PGI2 is rapidly hydrolyzed to 6-keto-PGF1α. Therefore, analogues of PGI2, such as OP-2507, beraprost, and iloprost have been used in most studies to investigate the function of PGI2. Our findings of the inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity by PGI2 is supported by results of studies involving PGI2 analogues. OP-2507 down-regulates NADPH oxidase activity in neutrophils exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (35Umeki S. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), whereas sodium beraprost inhibits p47phox translocation and phosphorylation in neutrophils stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine but not phorbol myristate acetate (36Okuyama M. Kambayashi J. Sakon M. Kawasaki T. Monden M. Life Sci. 1995; 57: 1051-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Recently, Muzaffar et al. (37Muzaffar S. Shukla N. Lobo C. Angelini G.D. Jeremy J.Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) suggested that iloprost antagonizes ROS production induced by the thromboxane A2 analogue and cytokines by attenuating NADPH oxidase activity through down-regulation of gp91phox in the smooth muscle and endothelial cells of pig pulmonary arteries. These results all suggest that PGI2 inhibits NADPH oxidase activity but with different mechanisms. These discrepancies may be due to the nonspecific activity of PGI2 analogues; they may cross-react with other prostaglandin receptors such as the PGE2 receptor (38Kiriyama M. Ushikubi F. Kobayashi T. Hirata M. Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we achieved augmentation of PGI2 production by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of COX-1 and PGIS. Our results demonstrate that Ad-COP1 infection augmented PGI2 level to ∼300 pg/ml, which is within the range of results of clinical studies showing that under various stresses, the PGI2 level can vary from <50 to >500 pg/ml (39Kluckow M. Evans N. Leslie G. Rowe J. Arch. Dis. Child. 1999; 80: F34-F37Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 40Matsumoto M. Ohki K. Nagai I. Oshibuchi T. Anesth.

Because Rac1 expression was markedly suppressed to <20% the level of controls, suppression of NADPH oxidase activity by PGI2 is mainly through down-regulation of Rac1. Intriguingly, for unclear reasons, NADPH oxidase activity was greatly diminished by PGI2 in cells exposed to prolonged hypoxia but only partially reduced under normoxia. Moreover, both Ad-COP1 infection and iloprost treatment up-regulated HIF-1α but not PGE2, which suggests that stabilization of HIF-1α under hypoxia is through PGI2 but not PGE2. Although PGE2 has been suggested to induce VEGF expression via stabilization of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions in human prostate tumor and colon carcinoma cells (41Liu X.H. Kirschenbaum A. Lu M. Yao S. Dosoretz A. Holland J.F. Levine A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50081-50086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 42Fukuda R. Kelly B. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2330-2334PubMed Google Scholar), PGI2 and PGE2 did not up-regulate HIF-1α under normoxia in HUVECs in our study. Because iloprost alone attenuated ROS production but Ad-COX-1 did not alter the ROS level (Fig. 5C), the antioxidant effect in cells infected with Ad-COP1 is mediated through PGI2 but not the increased expression of COX-1. In conclusion, as illustrated in Fig. 9, our results demonstrate a novel function of PGI2 in attenuating NADPH oxidase activity, which results in ROS reduction and activation of HIF-1 by stabilizing HIF-1α in HUVECs exposed to prolonged hypoxia or the hypoxia-normoxia transition but not normoxia. PGI2 inhibits NADPH oxidase activity by suppressing the protein expression of Rac1 and p47phox. Under prolonged hypoxia, HIF-1α degradation is signaled by H2O2, in that reduction of H2O2 stabilizes HIF-1α. These results reveal that PGI2 not only protects the cardiovascular system against thrombosis and atherosclerosis but also attenuates ROS production and extends HIF-1 activation under prolonged hypoxia."

Here we demonstrate that in tumoral pancreatic acinar AR42J cells, activation of SSTR2 leads to stimulation of the inhibitor κB kinase (IKK)/NFκB signaling cascade via pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The inability of Gq/11 and G12/13 proteins to activate IKK/NFκB by SSTR2 in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells and the lack of Gα16 in AR42J cells suggested a possible role of Gα14 in mediating SSTR2-induced responses. This regulatory role of Gα14 was further confirmed by the activation of IKK and NFκB in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing SSTR2 and Gα14 upon induction. The stimulatory effect of Gβ1γ2 and the abrogation by overexpressing transducin confirmed the participation of Gβγ in SSTR2-mediated IKK/NFκB activation. By the application of specific inhibitors and dominant negative mutants, phospholipase Cβ, protein kinase C, and calmodulin-dependent kinase II were shown to be involved in SSTR2-induced responses. Inhibition of c-Src and numerous intermediates, including Ras, Raf-1 kinase, MEK1/2, along with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase cascade attenuated somatostatin-mediated IKK/NFκB activation. Although c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) were also stimulated by SSTR2, suppression of these two MAPKs was ineffective in altering the somatostatin-mediated responses. Similar results were also obtained using AR42J cells. These data suggest that activation of the IKK/NFκB signaling cascade by SSTR2 requires a complicated network consisting of Gα14 and multiple intermediates.

Somatostatin is an endogenous regulatory peptide secreted by a wide range of tissues including neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and immune cells to inhibit the release of various hormones and growth hormones. These inhibitory actions are mediated through heptahelical transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; APQ, 6-amino-4-(-4-phenoxyphenylethylamino)quinazoline; CaMKII, calmodulin-dependent kinase II; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; IκBα, inhibitor κBα; IKK, IκB kinase; JNK, c-jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; PKC, protein kinase C; PLCβ, phospholipase Cβ; PTX, pertussis toxin; SST, somatostatin; SSTR2, somatostatin type 2 receptor; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. To date, five distinct subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) have been cloned (1Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). Among the various subtypes, the type 2 somatostatin receptor (SSTR2) has been studied extensively because of its broad clinical applications. Somatostatin analogs targeting SSTR2 have been used as treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, cystitis and other inflammatory diseases (2Paran D. Paran H. Curr. Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2003; 4: 578-582PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, somatostatin-related compounds hold promise against pancreatic diseases. Abundant SSTR2 expressions are generally detected from cells with pancreatic inflammatory and tumoral diseases (3Reubi J.C. Schaer J.C. Waser B. Mengod G. Cancer Res. 1997; 54: 3455-3459Google Scholar). In fact, somatostatin administration has been shown to relieve the severities of acute pancreatitis (4Kitagawa M. Naruse S. Ishiguro H. Hayakawa T. Pancreas. 1998; 16: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and carcinoids (5Rosenberg L. Lipsett M. Expert. Opin. Biol. Ther. 2003; 3: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As a Gi/o-coupled receptor, SSTR2 inhibits adenylyl cyclase and regulates several subsets of K+ channels and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels upon agonist binding. Furthermore, modulation of the activities of tyrosine phosphatase and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) by SSTR2 has been well documented (1Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that SSTR2 can also employ other G proteins such as G14 and G16 for signal transduction (6Ho M.K. Yung L.Y. Chan J.S. Chan J.H. Wong C.S. Wong Y.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Mody S.M. Ho M.K. Joshi S.A. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 13-23PubMed Google Scholar). Its ability to interact functionally with Gα14 is particularly interesting. Gα14 is a member of the Gq family and has more than 80% homology with Gαq. Upon activation by SSTR2, Gα14 stimulates phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) activity and the production of inositol trisphosphate. Unlike ubiquitously expressed Gαq/11 proteins, Gα14 is expressed predominantly in pancreas, spleen, lung, kidney, testis, bone marrow, several early myeloid and progenitor B cells (8Wilkie T.M. Scherle P.A. Strathmann M.P. Slepak V.Z. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10049-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and many of these tissues also express SSTR2 (1Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar); its mRNA has been detected in normal pancreatic islets (9Zigman J.M. Westermark G.T. LaMendola J. Steiner D.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 31-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as tumoral pancreatic acinar cells (10Yule D.I. Baker C.W. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G271-G279PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling via Gα14 may provide SSTR2 with the capacity to alter gene expression through the activation of kinases and transcription factors. G14-coupled opioid receptors, close relatives of SSTR2, have been shown to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (11Chan A.S. Wong Y.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 295: 1094-1100PubMed Google Scholar) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) (12Lo R.K. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the upstream cellular signals of SSTR2 have been delineated, the mechanism underlying the antiinflammatory and antitumoral effects of somatostatin remains poorly understood. One possible mechanism may involve nuclear factor-κB (NFκB), a ubiquitous heterodimeric transcription factor that regulates inflammation and cell survival and differentiation (13Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). In the inactive state, NFκB is anchored to inhibitor κBα (IκBα) in the cytosol. Upon activation, a key regulatory complex, IκB kinase (IKK), comprising two catalytic subunits (IKKα and IKKβ) and a linker (IKKγ/NEMO) is stimulated by phosphorylation. This activated complex then phosphorylates IκBα, which undergoes ubiquitin-dependent degradation (14Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The “free” NFκB then translocates into the nucleus and induces numerous NFκB-related gene transcriptions. A broad range of stimuli is able to activate NFκB; classical examples include cytokines such as interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, and environmental factors like ultraviolet rays. Recently, several GPCRs have also been reported to regulate NFκB. They include receptors for adenosine (15Liu A.M. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53196-53204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), bradykinin (16Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24907-24914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), chemokine (17Chandrasekar B. Bysani S. Mummidi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3188-3196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), dopamine (18Yang M. Zhang H. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Ye R.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and formyl peptide (19Yang M. Sang H. Rahman A. Wu D. Malik A.B. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6885-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is particularly noteworthy that the adenosine A1 receptor can employ Gα16 to activate NFκB (15Liu A.M. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53196-53204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) because Gα14 and Gα16 are highly similar in terms of both their receptor and effector selectivities. Because SSTR2 can interact functionally with Gα14 (6Ho M.K. Yung L.Y. Chan J.S. Chan J.H. Wong C.S. Wong Y.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it may well be able to regulate NFκB if Gα14 possesses the same capability as Gα16. Here we employed a pancreatic tumor cell line (AR42J) endogenously expressing SSTR2 (20Taylor J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and Gα14 (10Yule D.I. Baker C.W. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G271-G279PubMed Google Scholar) to test the ability of SSTR2 to regulate the phosphorylation of IKKα/β through Gα14. Additionally, the induction of NFκB-driven luciferase reporter was investigated in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells transiently expressing SSTR2 and Gα14. The possible involvement of various signaling intermediates such as protein kinase C (PKC), c-Src, and MAPKs was also investigated. Materials—All chemicals except PTX were purchased from Sigma or Calbiochem. PTX was from List Laboratories (Campbell, CA). Cell culture reagents, including Lipofectamine Plus and Lipofectamine 2000, were from Invitrogen. A selective antagonist for SSTR2, PRL-2903, was kindly donated by Dr. David Coy from Tulane Health Sciences Center (New Orleans, LA). The origins of cDNAs for receptors, G proteins, and other signaling molecules were as described previously (7Mody S.M. Ho M.K. Joshi S.A. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 13-23PubMed Google Scholar, 15Liu A.M. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53196-53204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter gene was obtained from Clontech Laboratories, and the luciferin substrate kit was a product of Roche Diagnostics. Normal rat pancreas membrane protein fraction was purchased from BioChain (Hayward, CA). Various antisera were products of Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) and Amersham Biosciences. Specific anti-Gα antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells (CRL-1573, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were maintained at 37 °C in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK 293 cells stably transfected with NFκB luciferase reporter were established as described previously (15Liu A.M. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53196-53204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For the luciferase assay, 1 day prior to transfection, HEK 293-NFκB cells were seeded at a density of 15,000 cells/well into white 96-well microplates designed for luminescent work (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). Cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding various receptors (12.5 ng) and G proteins (37.5 ng) using 0.2 μl of Plus and Lipofectamine reagents in 50 μl of Opti-MEM/well. In experiments in which other signaling molecules were investigated, 10 ng of receptor, 30 ng of G protein, and 10 ng of the signaling molecule cDNAs were transfected per well instead. After 3 h, 25 μl of Opti-MEM containing 30% fetal bovine serum was added to the well. For immunoblotting analysis, HEK 293 cells were seeded at 500,000 cells/well into 6-well plates 1 day prior to transfection, and the cells were transfected with 200 ng of receptor and 400 ng of G protein cDNAs/well using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. In the case of examining other signaling molecules, an extra 200 ng of cDNA encoding the gene of interest was also transfected. Rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells (CRL-1492, American Type Culture Collection) were cultured at 37 °C in F-12K medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For immunoblotting analysis, serum-starved AR42J cells were seeded at 400,000 cells/well into 12-well plates for further drug treatment. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Transfectants were grown in culture medium for 30 h and then maintained in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of 100 nm somatostatin-14 (SST) for 16 h. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml PTX for 4 h and/or various kinase inhibitors for 30 min before agonist challenge. Subsequently, the growth medium was removed and replaced by 25 μl of lysis buffer provided in the Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (Roche Diagnostics). The 96-well microplate was shaken on ice for 30 min. Luciferase activity was determined using a microplate luminometer LB96V (EG&G Berthold, Germany). Injector M connected to lysis buffer and injector P connected to the luciferin substrate were set to inject 25 μlof each component into each well. A 1.6-s delay time followed by a 2-s measuring time period was assigned to injector M, whereas injector P was measured for 10 s after the luciferin was introduced into the well. Results were collected by WinGlow version 1.24 and expressed as relative luminescent units. Statistical calculation was performed using KyPlot version 2.0. Immunoblotting Analysis—30 h after transfection, HEK 293 cells were serum starved overnight in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml PTX. The cells were then challenged by 100 nm SST for 10 min followed by cell lysis in 150 μl lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 40 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm Na3VO4,4 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. When kinase inhibitors were examined, the transfectants were pretreated with different kinase inhibitors for 30 min in serum-free medium. The cell lysates were shaken for 15 min, and the supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 2 min. Clarified lysates (40 μg) were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). For AR42J cells, treated cells were collected with 200 μl of lysis buffer, and the lysate was vortexed at maximal speed for 30 min at 4 °C. IKKα, phospho-IKKα(Ser180)/IKKβ(Ser181), ERK, phospho-ERK-(Thr202/Tyr204), JNK, phospho-JNK(Thr183/Tyr185), p38 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK(Thr180/Tyr182), c-Src, phospho-c-Src(Tyr416), Akt, and phospho-Akt(Thr308) were detected by specific primary antisera and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera. The immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence with the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Images detected on x-ray films were quantified by densitometric scanning using ImageJ software. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent sets of experiments. The probability of an observed difference being a coincidence was evaluated by analysis of variance and a paired t test using KyPlot software. Differences at values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. Activation of SSTR2 Leads to IKKα/β Phosphorylation in Rat Tumoral Pancreatic Acinar AR42J Cells—Given that SST has been employed to treat pancreatic inflammations and cancers (4Kitagawa M. Naruse S. Ishiguro H. Hayakawa T. Pancreas. 1998; 16: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 5Rosenberg L. Lipsett M. Expert. Opin. Biol. Ther. 2003; 3: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we began our studies by examining its effects on IKK/NFκB phosphorylations in rat pancreatic acinar AR42J cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, 100 nm octreotide, a SSTR2 selective agonist, was capable of inducing IKKα/β phosphorylation. This activation was unaffected by pretreatment of PTX, denoting a lack of involvement of PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins. The octreotide-mediated IKK activation was completely abolished by the coapplication of the highly potent SSTR2 cyclic disulfide antagonist, PRL-2903 (1 μm), confirming the selectivity of SSTR2-induced responses. AR42J cells were pretreated with PTX to eliminate possible interference from PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins. Time- and dose-dependent effects of octreotide were then determined. At 100 nm octreotide, the IKK was transiently phosphorylated with a peak activity occurring at 5 min; no phosphorylation of IKK could be detected after 20 min (Fig. 1B). At or below 1 nm octreotide, no phosphorylation of IKK could be detected with an incubation time of 5 min (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation of IKK became detectable at 10 nm octreotide and reached a peak at 100 nm, with no further increase in IKK phosphorylation at 1 μm octreotide (Fig. 1C). The estimated EC50 of this response was 10 nm, which was comparable with the established EC50 of 12 nm for SSTR2-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization in AR42J cells (20Taylor J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results showed that activation of SSTR2 can lead to transient phosphorylation of IKK in a PTX-insensitive and dose-dependent manner. Role of Gα14 in SSTR2-mediated Activation of IKK/NFκB Signaling—Several studies have illustrated that activation of NFκB by GPCRs can be mediated through different PTX-insensitive G proteins including G12/13 (21Shepard L.W. Yang M. Xie P. Browning D.D. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Kozasa T. Ye R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45979-45987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and members of the Gq family (15Liu A.M. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53196-53204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Xie P. Browning D.D. Hay N. Mackman N. Ye R.D. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 6885-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To identify which PTX-insensitive G protein is involved in SSTR2-mediated NFκB activation, we employed HEK 293 cells stably expressing a NFκB-driven luciferase reporter as a platform to express SSTR2 in combination with different G proteins. HEK 293 cells were pretreated with PTX to eliminate the possible interference from PTX-sensitive Gi/o proteins. In control experiments where pcDNA1 alone was transfected into HEK 293 cells, 100 nm SST was unable to induce NFκB-driven luciferase activity or IKK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A), thus indicating that the HEK 293 cells do not have endogenous SSTRs linked to the IKK/NFκB pathway. Interestingly, expression of SSTR2 in HEK 293 cells did not allow SST to elicit any luciferase signal or IKK phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Because Gα16 can support the activation of NFκB by the adenosine A1 receptor (15Liu A.M. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53196-53204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and Gα16 and Gα14 have similar signaling characteristics with the ability to interact with SSTR2 (6Ho M.K. Yung L.Y. Chan J.S. Chan J.H. Wong C.S. Wong Y.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Mody S.M. Ho M.K. Joshi S.A. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 13-23PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lo R.K. Wong Y.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Lo R.K. Cheung H. Wong Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52154-52165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we reasoned that Gα16 and/or Gα14 might link SSTR2 to NFκB. To test this hypothesis, HEK 293 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding Gα16 or Gα14 with SSTR2. An approximate 3-fold activation of NFκB-driven luciferase activity was observed when HEK 293 cells coexpressing Gα14 and SSTR2 were stimulated with 100 nm SST (Fig. 2A). SST-induced IKK phosphorylation also became detectable in these cells. Likewise, when Gα16 was coexpressed, significant NFκB-promoted luciferase activity and IKK phosphorylation were detected upon stimulation by 100 nm SST. Expression of Gα14 and Gα16 in the corresponding transfectants was confirmed by immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 2B). Although both Gα14 and Gα16 were able to link SSTR2 to the activation of NFκB, only Gα14 has been reported to be present in normal pancreatic islet (9Zigman J.M. Westermark G.T. LaMendola J. Steiner D.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 31-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and tumoral pancreatic acinar (10Yule D.I. Baker C.W. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G271-G279PubMed Google Scholar) cells. Indeed, the expression of Gα14 was confirmed in normal rat pancreas tissue (Fig. 2C) and in the plasma membranes of tumoral pancreatic AR42J cells (Fig. 2B). To ascertain that Gα14 can stimulate NFκB, we coexpressed the constitutively active mutant of Gα14 (Gα14QL) with SSTR2 and assessed NFκB-driven luciferase activity in the absence of SST. Indeed, Gα14QL transfectants exhibited a 4-fold increase in luciferase activity compared with the corresponding control (Fig. 2A, hatched bars). The constitutively active mutant of Gα16 (Gα16QL) was equally effective in stimulating NFκB-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2A). To characterize further the Gα14-dependent activation of NFκB by SSTR2, we examined the temporal characteristic, dose dependence, as well as selectivity of the SST-induced response. In these experiments, HEK 293 cells coexpressing both SSTR2 and Gα14 were pretreated with 100 ng/ml PTX for 16 h prior to the assays. We employed two selective agonists, octreotide and seglitide, and an antagonist of SSTR2, PRL-2903, to verify the specific involvement of SSTR2. As shown in Fig. 3A, the IKK phosphorylation and NFκB-driven luciferase activity induced by 100 nm octreotide were comparable with the SST-mediated responses, and similar results were obtained with 100 nm seglitide. The SSTR2 antagonist, PRL-2903 (10 μm), itself had no effect on IKK phosphorylation or NFκB-driven luciferase activity, but was able to abrogate the SST-induced IKK/NFκB responses completely (Fig. 3A). These results further confirmed the involvement of SSTR2. In terms of the onset and sustainability of SST-induced IKK phosphorylation, detectable phosphorylation was first observed at 1 min, and the response was sustained up to 60 min after reaching a plateau at 10 min (Fig. 3B). To assess the efficacy of SST in activating IKK/NFκB via Gα14, transfected HEK 293 cells were stimulated with various concentrations of SST (1 pm to 1 μm) for 10 min in the immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 3C, upper) or for 6 h in the luciferase expression experiments (Fig. 3C, lower). SST concentrations at or below 100 pm were unable to induce IKK phosphorylation or NFκB-driven luciferase activity, whereas both responses became significantly elevated at or above 10 nm SST. The estimated EC50 value for both responses was 20 nm. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the SST-induced activation of IKK/NFκB in HEK 293 cells exhibited typical pharmacological characteristics and required functional interaction between SSTR2 and Gα14. Participation of IKK and IκBα in SST-mediated IKK/NFκB Activation—It has long been suggested that the regulation of NFκB activity is mediated through modulation of IKK complex and degradation of the NFκB-anchoring IκBα protein (14Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To confirm the involvement of IKK in SSTR2-mediated activation of NFκB, we overexpressed IKKα and/or IKKβ (the two catalytic subunits of the IKK complex) in HEK 293 cells in conjunction with SSTR2 and Gα14 (Fig. 4A). SST generated a 3-fold stimulation of NFκB-driven luciferase activity over basal in control experiments. Expression of IKKα, IKKβ, or both IKKα and IKKβ together did not alter the SST-mediated responses. On the other hand, introduction of the kinase-deficient mutant of IKKα(IKKαDN) or IKKβ(IKKβDN) significantly inhibited SST-induced luciferase expression by around 25 and 45%, respectively (Fig. 4A). Moreover, coexpression of both IKKα and IKKβ dominant negative mutants further reduced the response; ∼75% inhibition compared with the corresponding wild types. As a confirmation, a selective and irreversible inhibitor of IKKα and IKKβ kinase activity, wedelolactone, was applied to the transfectants for 30 min prior to SST stimulation (Fig. 4B). 10 μm wedelolactone almost completely abrogated the SST-promoted NFκB-driven luciferase expression. Upon activation of IKK complex, IκBα, a substrate for IKK, is phosphorylated and proteosomally degraded, leading to the liberation of a p65-p50 complex for nuclear translocation and transcription. As shown in Fig. 4C, the overexpression of wild type IκBα produced a weak but significant inhibition in SST-induced NFκB-driven luciferase expression. The introduction of nonphosphorylable IκBα (IκBαAA) further reduced the SSTR2-mediated response. Moreover, a 30-min application of APQ, a NFκB activation inhibitor, also abolished the SST-promoted activation of NFκB by more than 60% (Fig. 4B). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the two catalytic subunits in the IKK complex and IκBα are important regulators in the SSTR2-mediated NFκB activation. Requirement of PLCβ Cascade in SSTR2-mediated IKK/NFκB Activation—One of the downstream effectors of Gα14 and other Gq family members is PLCβ, the activation of which leads to the production of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, and the subsequent stimulation of PKC and mobilization of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum. Indeed, previous findings have illustrated that SSTR2 can couple efficiently to Gα14 for inositol trisphosphate production (6Ho M.K. Yung L.Y. Chan J.S. Chan J.H. Wong C.S. Wong Y.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1431-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, the PLCβ cascade has been demonstrated to play an important role in the regulation of NFκB transcriptional activity (19Yang M. Sang H. Rahman A. Wu D. Malik A.B. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6885-6892Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether PLCβ and its downstream effectors, PKC and calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), are required in the SST-mediated activation of IKK and NFκB. In Fig. 5, A–C, we first used a series of protein kinase inhibitors to block the actions of PLCβ, PKC, and CaMKII. U73122 (10 μm), a PLCβ inhibitor, significantly attenuated the SST-induced IKK phosphorylation (Fig. 5B) and NFκB-driven luciferase activity by ∼60% (Fig. 5A). Its inactive analog, U73343 (10 μm), was unable to interfere with the IKK/NFκB activation. We then employed 10 μm KN62 to inhibit the calcium-sensitive CaMKII. Pretreatment with KN62 was effective in suppressing the SST-promoted activation of IKK (Fig. 5C) and NFκB (Fig. 5A) by around 50%, whereas its inactive analog, KN92, failed to produce any inhibition. The application of 100 nm staurosporine and 100 nm calphostin C, two PKC inhibitors, likewise reduced IKK phosphorylation (Fig. 5C) and NFκB-induced luciferase expression significantly (Fig. 5A). In terms of PKC, two different classes of PKC were examined: PKCα and PKCϵ. Calcium-dependent PKCα and calcium-independent PKCϵ were shown to participate in the SST-induced stimulation of IKK phosphorylation (Fig. 5D) and NFκB-driven luciferase activity (Fig. 5E). Upon expression of the dominant negative mutants of PKCα and PKCϵ, SST-induced IKK phosphorylation was abolished (Fig. 5D), whereas more than 70% inhibition was observed in the luciferase activity (Fig. 5E). Hence, PLCβ and its downstream effectors, PKC and CaMKII, appeared to be important in the activation of IKK and NFκB by SST. Regulation of Gβγ Subunits in S"
https://openalex.org/W2045175368,"TFIIH is a general transcription and repair factor implicated in RNA polymerase II transcription, nucleotide excision repair, and transcription-coupled repair. Genetic defects in TFIIH lead to three distinct inheritable diseases: xeroderma pigmentosa, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy, with xeroderma pigmentosa patients being highly susceptible to skin cancer. Earlier data revealed that the cyclin H subunit of TFIIH associates with U1 small nuclear RNA, a core-splicing component. In addition to its role in RNA processing U1 small nuclear RNA also regulates diverse stages of transcription by RNA polymerase II both in vivo and in vitro, including abortive initiation and re-initiation. Here we identify structural components of U1 and cyclin H implicated in the direct interaction and show how they affect function. Because of unique features of cyclin H we have developed a new methodology for mapping RNA interaction with the full-length cyclin H polypeptide based on electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. We also demonstrate the importance of U1 stem-loops 1 and 2 for the interaction with cyclin H. Functional assays implicate the identified interaction with U1 in regulation of the activity of the cyclin H associated kinase CDK7."

RFC is characterized by 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs), internally oriented N and C termini, and a large central linker connecting TMDs 1–6 and 7–12. By co-expression and N-hydroxysuccinimide methotrexate (Mtx) radioaffinity labeling of hRFC TMD 1–6 and TMD 7–12 half-molecules, combined with endoproteinase GluC digestion, a substrate binding domain was previously localized to within TMDs 8–12 (Witt, T. L., Stapels, S. E., and Matherly, L. H. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 46755–46763). In this report, this region was further refined to TMDs 11–12 by digestion with 2-nitro-5-thiocyanatobenzoic acid. A transportcompetent cysteine-less hRFC was used as a template to prepare single cysteine-replacement mutant constructs in which each residue from Glu-394 to Asp-420 of TMD 11 and Tyr-435 to His-457 of TMD 12 was replaced individually by a cysteine. The mutant constructs were transfected into hRFC-null HeLa cells. Most of the 50 single cysteine-substituted constructs were expressed at high levels on Western blots. With the exception of G401C hRFC, all mutants were active for Mtx transport. Treatment with sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES) had no effect on hRFC activity for all of the cysteine mutants within TMD 12 and for the majority of the cysteine mutants within TMD 11. However, MTSES inhibited Mtx uptake by the T404C, A407C, T408C, T412C, F416C, I417C, V418C, and S419C mutants by 25–65%. Losses of activity by MTSES treatment for T404C, A407C, T412C, and I417C hRFCs were appreciably reversed in the presence of excess leucovorin, a hRFC substrate. Our results strongly suggest that residues within TMD 11 are likely critical structural and/or functional components of the putative hRFC transmembrane channel for anionic folate and anti-folate substrates.

Our results strongly suggest that residues within TMD 11 are likely critical structural and/or functional components of the putative hRFC transmembrane channel for anionic folate and anti-folate substrates. The natural folates are water-soluble members of the B-class of vitamins. They act as one-carbon carriers in a series of metabolic reactions leading to the biosynthesis of purines, thymidylate, methionine, histidine, and serine (1Stokstad E.L.R. Picciano M.F. Stokstad E.L.R. Greogory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Thus, folates are essential for cell proliferation and tissue regeneration (1Stokstad E.L.R. Picciano M.F. Stokstad E.L.R. Greogory J.F. Folic Acid Metabolism in Health and Disease. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 1-21Google Scholar). Because folates cannot be synthesized de novo in mammalian cells, external dietary sources are required. Several pathophysiological states are associated with folate deficiency, ranging from cardiovascular disease to neural tube defects and cancer (2Lucock M. Mol. Genet. Metabol. 2000; 71: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 3Bailey L.B. Rampersaud G C. Kauwell G.P. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 1961-1968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As hydrophilic anionic molecules, natural folates show only minimal capacities to cross biological membranes by diffusion alone. Accordingly, sophisticated membrane transport systems have evolved to facilitate membrane translocation of these essential cofactors (4Matherly L.H. Goldman I.D. Vitam.

Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). hRFC proteins were detected with Myc monoclonal antibody (Covance, Berkeley, CA) and IRDye™ 800 conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). The membranes were scanned with an Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Membrane Transport Assays, MTSES Treatment, and Leucovorin Protection—The uptake of [3H]Mtx (0.5 μm) was measured over 2 min at 37 °C in 60-mm dishes in an anion-free buffer (20 mm Hepes, 235 mm sucrose, pH 7.3). The uptake of [3H]Mtx was quenched with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS (3×) and solubilized with 0.5 n NaOH. Levels of intracellular radioactivity were expressed as pmol/mg of protein, calculated from direct measurements of radioactivity and protein contents of cell homogenates. Protein assays were based on the method of Lowry et al. (42Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MTSES treatments were performed as described previously (35Cao W. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected R5 cells in 60-mm dishes were washed (3×) with PBS and then treated with 10 mm MTSES at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were quenched by a quick wash with 2-mercaptoethanol (14 mm in PBS), followed by two additional PBS washes and a single wash with anion-free buffer (see above). [3H]Mtx uptake was assayed as described above. To assess the protective effects of a hRFC substrate from MTSES inhibition, leucovorin (300 μm final concentration) was added 5 min before adding the MTSES reagent. Detection of the TMD 11-Loop Boundary with BM/SM—Thiol-reactive reagents were used for mapping the TMD 11-loop boundary region facing the extracellular side. R5 cells, grown in 60-mm dishes expressing hRFCmyc-his6 Cys-less and the F416C, I417C, V418C, S419C, D420C, V421C, R422C, and G423C single cysteine-substituted hRFCmyc-his6 mutants were treated with 200 μm SM (in PBS) at room temperature (25 °C) for 30 min followed by treatment with 200 μm BM (in PBS), or BM alone at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were briefly treated with 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol to remove excess reagent and then washed three times with PBS. Cells were harvested, and the plasma membranes were prepared, as described above. For immunoprecipitations, membrane proteins were solubilized in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). The insoluble material was pelleted (12,000 rpm, 10 min) and the supernatant was precleared for 4 h with protein G-plus-agarose beads. The beads were pelleted (12,000 rpm, 30 s) and the supernatant was incubated with anti-myc antibody and fresh protein G-plus-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer A, twice with lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate), and once with lysis buffer C (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate). The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted with 70 μl of 3× Laemmli sample buffer (containing 2% (w/v) SDS and 2 m 2-mercaptoethanol). Immunodetection of biotinylated hRFC was with peroxidaselinked streptavidin and Lumi-LightPLUS substrate (Roche Diagnostics), whereas total immunoprecipitated hRFC was detected using hRFC-specific antibody (21Wong S.C. Zhang L. Witt T.L. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10388-10394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and standard Lumi-Light substrate. Images were recorded on x-ray film with multiple exposures. Affinity Labeling of hRFC with NHS-Mtx Ester—Radiolabeled NHS-Mtx was prepared as described previously (28Witt T.L. Stapels S.E.

The radiospecific activity of the NHS-[3H]Mtx was 28 Ci/mmol. Cells were treated with NHS-[3H]Mtx (700 nm) as described previously (28Witt T.L. Stapels S.E. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46755-46763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 39Matherly L.H. Czajkowski C.A. Angeles S.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3420-3426PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma membranes were prepared, and membrane pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS. Aliquots of the radioaffinity-labeled membrane proteins (150 μg) were treated with 7.5 m guanidine HCl for 2 h and then digested with 10 mm of NTCB (Sigma) at pH 9 (pH adjusted with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 11) for 72 h at 37 °C. The NTCB treated samples were dialyzed against 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, overnight at 4 °C. Undigested and digested NTCB-treated proteins were fractionated for 28 h on 18% polyacrylamide gels with Tris-Tricine buffer (44Schagger H. von Jagon G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10408) Google Scholar). The gels were sliced into 2-mm segments, and the pieces were suspended into 1 ml of Soluene-350 (PerkinElmer Life Science) overnight at room temperature followed by 5 ml of Ready-value scintillation mixture (Beckman-Coulter). Radioactivity was detected on a Model 6500 Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed as described previously (28Witt T.L. Stapels S.E. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46755-46763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Cao W. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 3.3% paraformaldehyde/PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with anti-myc antibody, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence staining was observed with a Zeiss laser-scanning microscope 310 using a 63× water immersion lens. NTCB Digestion of Affinity-labeled hRFC TMD7–12Myc-His10 with NHS-[3H]Mtx—We previously expressed hRFC from separate TMD1–6 and TMD7–12 hRFC half-molecule constructs, each with a unique epitope tag, in hRFC-null K562 cells to restore transport activity (28Witt T.L. Stapels S.E. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46755-46763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Restored transport exhibited characteristic transport kinetics for Mtx, a capacity for trans-stimulation by pretreatment with leucovorin, and inhibition by NHS-Mtx, a documented affinity inhibitor of RFC. By coexpression and NHS-[3 H]Mtx radioaffinity labeling of hRFC TMD1–6 and TMD7–12 half-molecules, combined with GluC digestions, a critical substrate binding domain was localized to within TMDs 8–12 (28Witt T.L. Stapels S.E. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46755-46763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To further refine the region covalently modified with NHS-[3H]Mtx, plasma membranes from hRFC-TMD1–6HA /TMD7–12Myc-His10-transfected cells were digested with NTCB, followed by electrophoresis on Tris-Tricine gels. NTCB is a cysteine cutter, which selectively cleaves peptide bonds N-terminal to cysteine residues. For the TMD7–12 halfmolecule, up to five theoretical cuts are predicted, generating a range of fragments from 32 to 117 amino acids and molecular masses of 3,177–12,428 Daltons (TABLE ONE). As shown in Fig. 2, NTCB digestions resulted in a reproducible shift of the 40 kDa hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10 half-molecule to ∼7 kDa. This species could only have arisen from the 396–457 peptide, which includes TMDs 11 and 12 of hRFC (Fig. 1).TABLE ONEPredicted peptides in TMD7–12Myc-His10 half-molecule following digestions with NTCBPositionPeptideLength (amino acids)Peptide massDa32 (245)MVPSSPAVEKQVPVEPGNPGPGGKLGHALRVA323176.684151 (364)CGDSVLARMLRELGDSLRRPQLRLWSLWWVFNSAGYYLVVYYVHILWNEVDPTTNSARVYNGAADAASTLLGAITSFAAGFVKIRWARWSKLLIAGVTATQAGLVFLLAHTRHPSSIWL11913338.444182 (395)CYAAFVLFRGSYQFLVPIATFQIASSLSKEL313471.074244 (457)CALVFGVNTFFATIVKTIITFIVSDVRGLGLPVRKQFQLYSVYFLILSIIYFLGAMLDGLRH627000.451361CQRGHHPRQPPAQGLRSAAEEKAAQALSVQDKGLGGLQPAQSPPLSPEDSLGAVGPASLEQRQSDPYLAQAPAPQAAEFLQPGGSELGTKLGPEQKLISEEDLSAVDHHHHHHHHHH11712427.614 Open table in a new tab hRFCmyc-his6 wt and hRFCmyc-his6 Cys-less Exhibit Normal Membrane Targeting and Transport myc-his6 Function in hRFC-null R5 HeLa Cells—A functional hRFCmyc-his6 Cys-less construct was previously prepared and found to restore transport to RFC-null MTXRIIOuaR2–4 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (35Cao W. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the CHO model was restrictive in that it was necessary to isolate stable transfectants over several weeks and, even then, net hRFC expression levels and transport activities were modest (35Cao W. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the present study, wild type hRFCmyc-his6wt and hRFCmyc-his6Cys-less constructs were transiently expressed in hRFC-null R5 HeLa cells (38Zhao R. Chattopadhyay S. Hanscom M. Goldman I.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 8735-8742Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereupon they were detected at high levels and were efficiently targeted to the cell surface to restore transport activity (Fig. 3). On Western blots, the expressed proteins migrated at ∼58–80 kDa, similar to results with ectopically expressed hRFCmyc-his6Cys-less and hRFCmyc-his6 wt proteins in CHO cells (35Cao W. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 27-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the hRFCmyc-his6Cys-less protein was ∼60% of that for the wild type protein; transport was 51% of the wild type. Thus, R5 HeLa cells represent a new high throughput cell model that affords us a means to efficiently expand the scope of our SCAM experiments to probe hRFC ligand binding domains. Expression and Function of Single Cysteine-substituted hRFC Mutants of TMDs 11 and 12—Based on the finding that cleavage of the radioaffinity-labeled hRFC-TMD7–12Myc-His10 NTCB half-molecule localized substrate binding to within TMDs 11 and 12 (Fig. 2), we used the hRFCmyc-his6 Cys-less construct as a template to prepare consecutive single Cys-substituted mutants from Glu-394 to Asp-420 in TMD 11 and from Tyr-435 to His-457 in TMD 12. The single Cys-substituted mutant hRFC constructs were transiently transfected into transport-impaired R5 cells. A representative Western blot of plasma membrane proteins from the 50 mutant transfectants, along with proteins from hRFCmyc-his6 Cys-less transfected and untransfected R5 cells, is shown in Fig. 4, A and B. With only a few exceptions (e.g. F416C), all of the single Cys-substituted constructs of hRFC TMDs 11 and12 were expressed in R5 cells within a 2–3-fold range. Although the migrations of"

With excess camphor, three successive species were observed after generating oxyferrous P450-CAM and reacting versus reduced Pdx: a perturbed oxyferrous derivative, a species that was a mixture of high and low spin Fe(III), and high spin ferric camphor-bound enzyme. The rates of the first two steps, ∼140 and ∼85 s-1, were assigned to formation of the perturbed oxyferrous intermediate and to electron transfer from reduced Pdx, respectively. In the presence of stoichiometric substrate, three phases with similar rates were seen even though the final state is low spin ferric P450-CAM. This is consistent with substrate being hydroxylated during the reaction. The single turnover reaction initiated by adding dioxygen to a preformed reduced P450-CAM·Pdx complex with excess camphor also led to phases with similar rates. It is proposed that formation of the perturbed oxyferrous intermediate reflects alteration of H-bonding to the proximal Cys, increasing the reduction potential of the oxyferrous state and triggering electron transfer from reduced Pdx. This species may be a direct spectral signature of the effector role of Pdx on P450-CAM reactivity (i.e. during catalysis). The substrate-free oxyferrous enzyme also reacted readily with reduced Pdx, showing that the inability of substrate-free P450-CAM to accept electrons from reduced Pdx and function as an NADH oxidase is completely due to the incapacity of reduced Pdx to deliver the first but not the second electron.

The cytochrome P-450 family of heme-containing mono-oxygenases is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and in the production of physiologically important molecules (1Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar). A defining characteristic of the P-450 family is the proximal thiolate-ligated heme.

The electrons required for the reaction flow from NADH to the flavoprotein, putidaredoxin reductase, then to the iron-sulfur (2Fe/2S) protein, putidaredoxin (Pdx), and finally to P450-CAM. In the widely quoted P450 reaction cycle shown in Fig. 1 (1Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2091) Google Scholar), substrate binding converts the ferric low spin resting state (1) to the ferric high spin form (2). Electron transfer from reduced Pdx gives high spin deoxyferrous P-450 (3). Dioxygen binding yields the oxy-ferrous adduct, a ferrous-O2/ferric superoxide resonance hybrid (4a ↔ 4b). CO binding to 3 generates the ferrous-CO derivative (5). Addition of the second electron from reduced Pdx has been proposed to yield a ferric peroxo species (6a), protonation of which gives the hydroperoxo state (6b). Protonation of the distal oxygen produces water and compound I, a ferryl porphyrin π-cation radical (7). This highly oxidizing intermediate abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate onto the ferryl oxygen to produce a substrate radical. Radical recombination yields the oxygenated product, and the addition of H2O reforms 1.FIGURE 1Reaction cycle of cytochrome P-450 including postulated intermediates. The porphyrin macrocycle is abbreviated as a parallelogram of nitrogens. States 1, 2, and 7 are neutral (the dot and positive charge on 7 indicate the porphyrin π-cation radical). The overall charge on states 3, 4a, 4b, 5, and 6b is -1, and that on 6a is -2. Paths A and B represent “short circuit” routes to product formation, and paths C and D are uncoupling pathways.

It has been shown that in catalysis, putidaredoxin reductase does not form a ternary complex (putidaredoxin reductase/Pdx/P450-CAM) (16Purdy M.M. Koo L.S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Klinman J.P.

This study builds upon the highly demanding single mixing/single wavelength kinetics study of Brewer and Peterson (25Brewer C.B. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 791-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the earlier work of Pederson et al. (26Pederson T.C. Austin R.H. Gunsalus I.C. Ullrich V. Roots I. Hildebrandt A. Estabrook R.W. Conney A.H. Microsomes and Drug Oxidations. Pergamon Press, Oxford, UK1977: 275-283Crossref Google Scholar) and Hui Bon Hoa et al. (27Hui Bon Hoa G. Begard E. Debey P. Gunsalus I.C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2835-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and provides considerable additional detail about the reaction between oxyferrous P-450 and reduced Pdx, including the effector roles of Pdx with P450-CAM. Two recent studies provide useful background for the reactions of reduced P-450 with dioxygen. Tosha et al. (28Tosha T. Yoshioka S. Hori H. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13883-13893Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) recently investigated the roles of amino acids at the putative Pdx·P450-CAM interface, building on previous work by Unno et al. (29Unno M. Shimada H. Toba Y. Makino R. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17869-17874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Zhang et al. (30Zhang H. Gruenke L. Arscott D. Shen A. Kasper C. Harris D.L. Glavanovich M. Johnson R. Waskell L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11594-11603Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have studied the analogous reduction of oxyferrous mammalian P-450-2B4 by its flavoprotein P-450 reductase. Materials and Sample Preparation—(1R)(+)-Camphor was purchased from Sigma, sodium dithionite was from Aldrich, and buffer chemicals were from Fisher. 5-exo-Hydroxy-(1R)-camphor was synthesized from (1R)-camphor following the procedure reported by Li et al. (31Li H. Narasimhulu S. Havran L.M. Winkler J.D. Poulos T.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 6297-6299Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and was purified by silica gel column chromatography. P450-CAM and Pdx were individually overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as reported (32Unger B.P. Gunsalus I.C. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1158-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ferric camphor-bound P450-CAM and oxidized Pdx concentrations were determined using ϵ391 = 102 mm-1 cm-1 and ϵ455 = 10.4 mm-1 cm-1, respectively (33Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 166-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The Pdx used had a ratio of A325/A280 ≥ 0.63 to establish purity. For stopped-flow experiments, P450-CAM and Pdx in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, with or without 500 μm camphor, as required, were placed in tonometers either as separate solutions or mixed. Substrate-free P450-CAM was prepared by Sephadex G-25 chromatography in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, to remove camphor, followed by a second G-25 column in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl (34Eble K.S. Dawson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); stoichiometric camphor-bound P450-CAM was prepared by passing the protein through the latter G-25 column and then titrating back with just enough camphor to form the high spin ferric state. Protein solutions were made anaerobic by multiple cycles of alternately evacuating and flushing with oxygen-free argon at 25 °C over a period of 30 min. Reduced P450-CAM and Pdx were prepared by titration with microliter increments of a concentrated sodium dithionite stock solution until the ferric states were fully reduced as judged spectrally. Stopped-flow Experiments—Rapid scan stopped-flow experiments were carried out at 3-4 °C on a Hi-Tech Ltd. SF-61 DX2 instrument equipped for anaerobic work and with a Hi-Tech MG-6000 rapid scan diode array detector. Dead times were determined to be 1.5 ms. In single and double mixing experiments, numerous scans were recorded; the data displayed are representative. For double mixing experiments, a delay time of 100 ms was optimal for complete oxyferrous enzyme formation with essentially no autoxidation. The kinetic data were fit to various reaction models by the KinetAsyst program (Hi-Tech Ltd.) or by singular value decomposition and multiple component analysis to derive spectra of intermediates using the Specfit program from Spectrum Software Associates. Product Binding—The Kd value for binding 5-exo-hydroxy-camphor to ferric substrate-free P450-CAM was determined by Hill analysis of ligand titration data obtained by the addition of microliter aliquots of a concentrated stock solution of substrate to the substrate-free enzyme. Formation and Stability of Oxyferrous P450-CAM—The reaction of dioxygen at 4 °C with camphor-bound reduced P450-CAM occurs with a rate constant of ∼106 m-1 s-1 (data not shown). Thus, at a dioxygen concentration of 130 μm (aerobic buffer prepared at 20 °C (35Hitchman M.L. Measurement of Dissolved Oxygen. Wiley, Geneva, Switzerland1978: 7-33Google Scholar) mixed with anaerobic buffer), the rate would be about 130 s-1 (t½ = ∼5 ms). The UV-visible absorption spectrum of oxyferrous P450-CAM (Fig. 2) has Soret and visible region absorption peaks at 418 and 556 nm, respectively (419 and 554 nm at -30 °C in 65% ethylene glycol/phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) (36Sono M. Eble K.S. Dawson J.H. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15530-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After formation of the oxyferrous species, essentially no spectral changes were observed for up to 60 s, as expected from the reported t½ for autoxidation of 25 min at this temperature (11Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substrate-free oxyferrous P450-CAM was also rapidly produced in a similar manner and likewise had UV-visible absorption peaks at 418 and 556 nm (data not shown). The t½ for autoxidation of substrate-free oxyferrous P450-CAM was determined to be 90 s at 4 °C, pH 7.4. In the double mixing experiments, the oxyferrous P450-CAM was allowed to form for ∼100 ms and then was mixed with the next reagent. Consequently, more than 99% of the P450-CAM was in the oxyferrous form at the time of the second mix. The Reaction of Camphor-bound Oxyferrous P450-CAM with Oxidized Pdx—In principle, oxidized Pdx should be incapable of reacting with oxyferrous cytochrome P-450 because, being in the oxidized state, it cannot provide an electron to reduce the oxyferrous enzyme. However, Lipscomb et al. (11Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated nearly 30 years ago that oxidized Pdx could mediate the formation of up to one-half an equivalent of product from substrate-bound oxyferrous P450-CAM. The mechanism of this process has yet to be established. To quantify the kinetics of this effect, we examined the reaction of a 2-fold excess of oxidized Pdx with oxyferrous P450-CAM, first in the presence of a large excess of camphor and then in the presence of only a 2-fold excess of substrate. Dithionite-reduced ferrous P450-CAM in the presence of ∼100-fold excess of camphor was mixed, initially against aerobic buffer to create oxyferrous P450-CAM and then against a 2-fold excess of oxidized Pdx (Fig. 2A). The first trace is the spectrum of camphor-bound oxyferrous P450-CAM plus that of oxidized Pdx. Over the next 60 s, spectral changes yielded the spectrum of camphor-bound high spin ferric P450-CAM with peaks at 392, 539, and 561 nm plus minor contributions from Pdx. The t½ for this reaction is 10 s, 150-fold less than that for the formation of ferric camphor-bound P450-CAM from the oxyferrous enzyme (t½ = 25 min) in the absence of oxidized Pdx. The same experiment was repeated with oxyferrous P450-CAM prepared in the presence of only a 2-fold excess of substrate (Fig. 2B). The first spectral scan again shows the spectrum of oxyferrous P450-CAM. The last trace is the spectrum of a mixture of high and low spin state forms of ferric P450-CAM caused by the presence of the slight excess of camphor, plus contributions from Pdx. Normally, at these concentrations, one would expect that P450-CAM would be fully saturated with camphor and be high spin. However, the presence of Pdx weakens the binding of camphor (11Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The t½ for breakdown of oxyferrous P450-CAM under these conditions was estimated to be 12 s. These two experiments (Fig. 2) reveal that the rate of conversion of oxyferrous to ferric P450-CAM is >100-fold enhanced (smaller t½) in the presence of oxidized Pdx. The rate enhancement is essentially the same whether the experiment is done in the presence of a large or small excess of camphor. This quantifies the dramatic extent to which oxidized Pdx decreases the t½ for formation of the ferric enzyme that Lipscomb et al. (11Lipscomb J.D. Sligar S.G. Namtvedt M.J. Gunsalus I.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1116-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had qualitatively reported. The Reaction of Camphor-bound Oxyferrous P450-CAM with Reduced Pdx in the Presence of Excess Camphor—This double mixing experiment involves the formation of camphor-bound oxyferrous P450-CAM in the first mixing step in which reduced P450-CAM is mixed with oxygenated buffer (Fig. 1, 3 → 4). After reacting for 100 ms, the second mixing step in the stopped-flow instrument introduces dithionite-reduced Pdx to initiate several steps converting 4 to 2 (Fig. 1). The camphor concentration (500 μm) was in large excess of the P450-CAM concentration (10 μm). Fig. 3 shows spectra recorded during the first 1000 ms of the reaction. The inset is an expanded view of the Soret absorption region. The first scan at 1.5 ms after the second mix is identified principally as the UV-visible absorption spectrum of oxyferrous P450-CAM, with a Soret absorption peak at 418 nm and a peak in the visible region at 554 nm. An initial increase in the intensity and a slight blue shift of the Soret absorption peak of the oxyferrous enzyme from 418 to ∼414 nm ensues during the first 17 ms, with an isosbestic point at 421 nm, and this is followed over the next 41 ms by a decrease in intensity and a further blue shift in peak position to a broad “double hump.” This process occurs with an isosbestic point at 405 nm. As will be discussed below, the rate of the second phase correlates with the rate reported by Brewer and Peterson (25Brewer C.B. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 791-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the electron transfer from reduced Pdx to oxyferrous P450-CAM coupled with the formation of product. From this, we conclude that the protein is in the ferric state by the end of phase 2, and we thereby assign the broad double hump spectrum to a mixture of low spin and high spin ferric P450-CAM species. The third and slowest (k < 5s-1) phase seen in Fig. 3 occurs between 61 and 1000 ms. In this step, the Soret band is evolving with an isosbestic point at 408 nm into what is clearly high spin camphor-bound ferric P450-CAM. Singular value decomposition and global analysis of the data in Fig. 3 are shown in Fig. 4, which illustrates a fully resolved quite intense perturbed Soret peak at 413.5 nm (species B). The single peak in the visible region has decreased slightly in intensity and shifted from 554 to ∼548 nm. We refer to this species evolving in phase I as perturbed oxyferrous P450-CAM. This intermediate converts to C, the double-humped spectrum, which slowly converts to D, high spin camphor-bound ferric P450-CAM (Fig. 4). Because the perturbed oxyferrous enzyme Soret absorption peak is at nearly the same wavelength as that of ferric P450-CAM oxygen-donor ligand complexes (37Dawson J.H. Andersson L.A. Sono M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3606-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we were initially concerned that the species at the end of the first phase might in fact be the product complex formed by binding of the alcohol oxygen of 5-exo-hydroxycamphor to ferric P450-CAM. However, as seen in the inset to Fig. 4, although the spectrum of 5-exo-hydroxy-camphor-bound ferric P450-CAM also has a Soret absorption peak at 413 nm, it has two distinct peaks in the visible region at 566 and 534 nm rather than the single peak seen for the perturbed oxyferrous species. Thus, despite the near coincidence in the position of their Soret absorption peaks, the overall absorption spectrum of 5-exo-hydroxycamphor-bound ferric P450-CAM is quite different from that of the perturbed oxyferrous P450-CAM·Pdx. These results demonstrate that the species formed at the end of phase 1 is not the product complex. To obtain more accurate and resolved kinetic data to use in determining rate constants for the first two phases, the experiment was repeated using single wavelength detection. Fig. 5 shows the spectral changes that occur at 418 nm for the first 100 ms. Data from this time period covers the first two phases of the reaction and could be fitted with a sum of two exponential functions. The first phase is characterized by a rate of ∼140 ± 14 s-1, and the second phase is characterized by a rate of ∼85 ± 8 s-1. Essentially identical rate constants were obtained at several different wavelengths (data not shown). The first rate corresponds to the conversion of oxyferrous P450-CAM to the perturbed oxyferrous intermediate. To assign the second rate constant, we turn to the work of Brewer and Peterson (25Brewer C.B. Peterson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 791-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who examined the reaction of reduced Pdx with oxyferrous P450-CAM under similar conditions to those described herein, but they used single mixing/single wavelength (420 nm) stopped-flow absorption spectroscopy, because of the limitations of the instrumentation available at that time. Only a single reaction phase with a rate of 60-100 s-1 was observed (from our data this would be expected, because the conversion of oxyferrous to the perturbed oxyferrous is essentially isosbestic at 420 nm). They assigned the rate to the electron transfer from reduced Pdx to oxyferrous P450-CAM on the basis of their careful parallel measurements of both the rate of electron transfer from reduced Pdx observed by freeze-quench EPR spectroscopy and the rate of product (5-exo-hydroxycamphor) formation, determined from chemical quench experiments. We therefore conclude that the rate of the second phase observed in Figs. 3 and 5 (∼85 s-1) likely corresponds to the rate of electron input from reduced Pdx to the perturbed oxyferrous intermediate and the formation of product. Additional support for this conclusion comes from the appearance during this phase of absorbance at ∼640 nm that is characteristic of high spin ferric P-450 (38Dawson J.H. Sono M. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 1255-1276Crossref Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The Reaction of Oxyferrous P450-CAM with Reduced Pdx in the Presence of Stoichiometric Camphor—We repeated the experiment with oxyferrous P450-CAM prepared with essentially only one equivalent of camphor bound to verify that camphor was being hydroxylated, as well as to separate out steps involved in releasing product and rebinding camphor. Camphor binds to ferric P450-CAM very tightly (Kd = ∼0.5 μm). This makes it possible to prepare a fully substrate-bound enzyme sample with essentially stoichiometrically added substrate. Reaction of the oxyferrous state of such a sample with reduced Pdx depletes the single equivalent of camphor, so that at the end of the experiment, the low spin ferric state (substrate-free) has formed. Fig. 6 displays UV-visible absorbance spectra recorded during the reaction. The formation of low spin substrate-free ferric P450-CAM is confirmed by the"

There are two major splice variants of the Optimedin mRNA, Optimedin A and Optimedin B, transcribed from different promoters. The expression pattern of the Optimedin A variant in the eye and brain overlaps with that for Pax6, which encodes a protein containing the paired and homeobox DNA-binding domains. The Pax6 gene plays a critical role for the development of eyes, central nervous system, and endocrine glands. The proximal promoter of the Optimedin A variant contains a putative Pax6 binding site in position –86/–70. Pax6 binds this site through the paired domain in vitro as judged by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Mutations in this site eliminate Pax6 binding as well as stimulation of the Optimedin promoter activity by Pax6 in transfection experiments. Pax6 occupies the binding site in the proximal promoter in vivo as demonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Altogether these results identify the Optimedin gene as a downstream target regulated by Pax6. Although the function of optimedin is still not clear, it is suggested to be involved in cell-cell adhesion and cell attachment to the extracellular matrix. Pax6 regulation of Optimedin in the eye and brain may directly affect multiple developmental processes, including cell migration and axon growth.

Although the exact functions of different olfactomedin domain-containing proteins as well as the molecular mechanisms of their action are still not known, a growing amount of evidence indicates that proteins belonging to this family may play important roles in the normal development of different organs. Noelin-1 is involved in the regulation of the production of neural crest cells by the neural tube in chicken (5Barembaum M. Moreno T.A. LaBonne C. Sechrist J. Bronner-Fraser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and promotes neurogenesis in Xenopus (26Moreno T.A. Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 340-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Xenopus Tiarin may participate in the specification of the dorsal neural tube (7Tsuda H. Sasai N. Matsuo-Takasaki M. Sakuragi M.

Sea urchin amassin mediates the massive intercellular adhesion of coelomocytes, the immune cells contained in the coelomic cavity (4Hillier B.J. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mutations in the olfactomedin domain may be deleterious for the functions of these proteins. For example, mutations in the olfactomedin domain of the human MYOCILIN gene may lead to juvenile open-angle glaucoma and in some cases to adult onset glaucoma (27Stone E.M. Fingert J.H. Alward W.M. Nguyen T.D. Polansky J.R. Sunden S.F. Nishimura D. Clark A.F. Nystuen A. Nichols B.E. Mackey D.A. Ritch R. Kalenak J.W. Craven E.R. Sheffield V.C.

Unlike wild-type myocilin, mutated myocilin does not move properly through the secretory pathway and is not secreted from cells (29Jacobson N. Andrews M. Shepard A.R. Nishimura D. Searby C. Fingert J.H. Hageman G. Mullins R. Davidson B.L. Kwon Y.H. Alward W.L. Stone E.M. Clark A.F. Sheffield V.C. Hum. Mol.

Sci. 2004; 45: 3560-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the presence of mutated myocilin, secretion of wild-type myocilin is also inhibited. It has been suggested that chronic expression of mutated, non-secreted myocilin leads to trabecular meshwork cell death and, ultimately, a dominant glaucoma phenotype (32Liu Y. Vollrath D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1193-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 33Joe M.K. Sohn S. Hur W. Moon Y. Choi Y.R. Kee C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because olfactomedin-related proteins appear to play significant roles in normal development and pathology, regulation of their activity represents an important area of research. Not much is known about regulation of these genes. It has been demonstrated that the human MYOCILIN gene is activated by glucocorticoids with a delayed kinetics (34Polansky J.R. Fauss D.J. Chen P.

Sci. 2001; 42: 3173-3181PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the upstream regulatory factor may be essential for the regulation of the MYOCILIN gene (37Kirstein L. Cvekl A. Chauhan B.K. Tamm E.R. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 661-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ETS-family transcription factor PU.1 (Spi-1) may be involved in the regulation of the pDP4 gene in mature mouse granulocytes (19Rosenbauer F. Wagner K. Zhang P. Knobeloch K.P. Iwama A. Tenen D.G. Blood. 2004; 103: 4294-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present work, we investigated the regulation of the mouse Optimedin gene. In the mouse brain and retina, only the Optimedin A promoter is actively used. The proximal promoter of the Optimedin A gene contains putative binding sites for several transcription factors, including a homeo- and paired domain protein Pax6. Pax6 is a transcription factor that is critical for development of several tissues including eyes, central nervous system, and endocrine glands (see Ref. 38Simpson T.I. Price D.J. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar for review). Several downstream targets of Pax6 have been identified and they include transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, hormones, and structural proteins (38Simpson T.I. Price D.J. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 39Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Results presented in this article indicate that the Optimedin gene is another downstream target gene for Pax6. Cell Cultures and Plasmid Construction—Monkey COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat retinal ganglion RGC-5 cells (40Krishnamoorthy R.R. Agarwal P. Prasanna G. Vopat K. Lambert W. Sheedlo H.J. Pang I.H. Shade D. Wordinger R.J. Yorio T. Clark A.F. Agarwal N. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 86: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. N. Agarwal (University of North Texas Health Science Center). RGC-5 cells were incubated in F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1), containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 1.5 mm l-glutamine, 7.5 mm Na-pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. Murine βTC3 cells were kindly provided by Dr. S. Efrat (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York). βTC3 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media, containing 15% horse serum and 2.5% bovine serum. All cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Different regions of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse Optimedin A promoter were amplified by PCR and cloned into the promoterless, enhancerless expression vector pGL3-Basic (Promega) upstream of the Luciferase reporter gene. KpnI/SmaI restriction sites were used for cloning of the –3153/+98 and –2829/+98 promoter fragments, whereas XhoI/HindII restriction sites were used for cloning of the –136/+24 promoter fragment. These promoter constructs were designated p3153OPT, p2829OPT, and p136OPT, respectively. Constructs containing mutations in the putative Pax6 and Sox binding sites were produced using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A putative Pax6 binding site, 5′-CTGAACTGGAGCGTAAG-3′ (position –86/–70), was changed to 5′-CTGAACTGGAttcTAAG-3′. A putative Sox binding site, 5′-TAACAAAT-3′ (position –60/–52), was changed to 5′-gggCAAT-3′. The resulting mutated plasmids (see Fig. 1, B–C) were named p2829MUTp, p136MUTp (Pax6 mutants), p2829MUTs and p136MUTs (Sox mutants). The identity of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Sox2, Sox11, and Brn1 cDNAs were cloned into the pCMV5 expression vector (41Wiebe M.S. Nowling T.K. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17901-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42Gonzalez M.I. Tovaglieri A. Robins D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 190: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Drs. A. Rizzino (University of Nebraska) and D. Robbins (University of Michigan), respectively. Sox8 cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3 expressio nvector (43Schepers G.E. Bullejos M. Hosking B.M. Koopman P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. P. Koopman (The University of Queensland, Australia). Brn3b, NeuroD, and Math5 cDNAs were cloned into the pRK5 expression vector and were kindly provided by Dr. L. Gan (University of Rochester). Six5 cDNA was cloned into the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (44Ohto H. Kamada S. Tago K. Tominaga S.I. Ozaki H. Sato S. Kawakami K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6815-6824Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. K. Kawakami (Jichi Medical School, Japan). cDNAs encoding Pax6 and Pax6(5a) were cloned into the pKW10 expression vector; the paired domain of Pax6, and the paired domain of Pax6(5A) were cloned into the vector pETH2a (45Kozmik Z. Czerny T. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6793-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Luciferase Assay—For luciferase assay, COS7 or RGC-5 cells were plated on the 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well for COS7 cells and 1.5–2 × 104 cells/well for RGC-5 cells. Cells were transfected 24 h after plating using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. pRL-CMV or pRL-null plasmids provided an internal standard of luciferase activity to which all the measurements were normalized. Three independent transfection reactions were performed for each combination. Dual luciferase assay was performed 48 h after transfection using the Dual Luciferase Reporter® Assay 1000 System (Promega). All experiments were repeated at least twice. Western Blotting—To estimate amounts of Sox2 and Sox11 proteins in the nuclear extracts, different amounts of these extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked in the blocking solution (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C overnight. Primary monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) were used in 1:4000 dilution. Secondary anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) were used in 1:10000 dilution. To estimate the content of Pax6 in COS-7, RGC-5, and βTC3 cells, cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS), sonicated, centrifuged at 14,000 × g, and the supernatant was used for Western blotting. Rabbit anti-Pax6 polyclonal IgG (Covance, Richmond, CA) were used in 1:200 dilution as a primary antibody. Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used as a secondary antibody in 1:4000 dilution. All blots were visualized by SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Detection kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) 2The abbreviations used are: EMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayChIPchromatin immunoprecipitation. —COP8 cells were transfected with different Pax6-expressing constructs. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (46Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). The levels of Pax6 and Pax6(5a) expression were evaluated by Western blotting as described above. EMSA with Escherichia coli expressed and affinity purified paired domains was performed as described (45Kozmik Z. Czerny T. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6793-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Final concentration of the binding reaction (1× EMSA buffer) was 4% Ficoll, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl. Anti-Pax6 antibodies used for EMSA were rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against the Pax6 paired domain (47Carriere C. Plaza S. Martin P. Quatannens B. Bailly M. Stehelin D. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7257-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or the C terminus (48Davis J.A. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5082-5094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Pax2 rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of Pax2 was purchased from Covance Research Product (Berkley, CA). electrophoretic mobility shift assay chromatin immunoprecipitation. COS7 cells were transfected with expression constructs pCMVSox2FLAG or pCMVFLAGSox11. Nuclear extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection using NE-PER® Reagents (Pierce Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The binding reaction contained 17–18 μl of 1× binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 4% Ficoll, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μg/ml poly(dG-dC)) and corresponding oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides were used at ∼0.1 ng/μl and 20,000 cpm/μl per reaction. In competition experiments, 50- or 500-fold excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were added to binding reactions. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The whole mouse embryonic brain (E17) was used as a tissue source of chromatin. Brain tissues were homogenized in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (900 μl/brain) with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature with gentle shaking. Cross-linking was terminated by treatment with 125 mm glycine for 5 min and two washes in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were then processed using a ChIP assay kit, essentially as described by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). In brief, the cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer with protease inhibitors, then sonicated using a model W-220F Heat Systems Ultrasonics (Farmingdale, NY) to shear DNA to fragments with a length of 100–1000 bp. 1% of the cell lysate was saved as input chromatin for PCR analysis. To reduce nonspecific background, the rest of the cell lysate was precleared by incubation with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry. Supernatants from three equal reactions were incubated with 10 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), 5 μg of rabbit anti-Pax6 polyclonal IgG (Covance), or 5 μg of goat anti-Sox11 polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. One additional reaction without any antibodies served as a negative control. Chromatin-antibody complexes were precipitated by incubation with Protein A-agarose beads. Chromatin was eluted from the beads after washes in several buffers provided with the kit. The DNA-protein cross-links in all samples including the input were reversed by incubation for 4 h at 65°C followed by incubation with proteinase K for 1 h at 45°C. DNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The PCR primer pairs used for ChIP assay were as follows. The first pair spanning the –235/+104 region was 5′-ATAACTCAATGTCAGTTCACTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCCCTTCTGTTAGACAGCC-3′ (reverse); the second pair in the region –3719/–3421 was 5′-GAAACGCTATATGACAGCCTCT–3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTCAATTTTTAGTGAATGCATG–3′ (reverse); the third pair located in the 6th intron of the Optimedin gene was 5′-GGTAAGTTTAGATGATTGATGAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTACACATCATGAAACACAATGG-3′ (reverse). The 2nd and 3rd pairs served as negative controls. PCR conditions were as follows: 3 min at 94 °C followed by 29 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 40 s at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C, and a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Analysis of the Proximal Promoter Sequence of the Optimedin Gene—Two Optimedin gene transcripts transcribed from different promoters were identified in rat tissues (1Torrado M. Trivedi R. Zinovieva R. Karavanova I. Tomarev S.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Optimedin A was preferentially expressed in the retina and brain, whereas Optimed in B was preferentially expressed in the combined tissues of the eye angle (trabecular mesh work, iris, and ciliary body). In the adult rat retina, Optimedin A was expressed mainly in the ganglion and inner nuclear layers (1Torrado M. Trivedi R. Zinovieva R. Karavanova I. Tomarev S.I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A similar pattern of Optimed in gene expression was observed in mouse tissues, although the level of its expression in the mouse eye angle tissues was lower than in rats (not shown). Because we were interested in the Optimedin gene expression in the retina and brain, we compared the Optimedin A promoter sequences from mouse, rat, and human. The Optimedin A promoter will be called the Optimedin promoter throughout the paper. Two conserved regions were identified that were located in the positions (–211/–1) and (–3070/–2759) of the mouse promoter (Fig. 1A). The mouse proximal promoter region (positions (–211/–1) did not contain a consensus TATA box sequence. It contained several closely spaced putative binding sites for Pax6, Sox, Six, and USF transcription factors (Fig. 1A). Some of these sites were well conserved in the rat and human promoters as well. Activity of the Optimedin Promoter in Vitro—The basal activity of the Optimedin promoter and possible involvement of several transcription factors in regulation of its activity was first tested in COS7 cells. Several promoter deletion constructs were prepared. The longest p3153OPT construct included both conserved elements identified in the Optimedin promoter, whereas the shortest p136OPT construct included only part of the proximal conserved element (Fig. 1, A and B). p3153OPT, p2829OPT, and p136OPT gave 10.3 ± 2.6-, 6.0 ± 1.2-, and 8.3 ± 2.1-fold stimulation over the pGL3 vector in COS7 cells (not shown). p136OPT will be called a proximal promoter throughout the paper. The effects of a number of transcription factors on Optimedin promoter activity were tested in transfection experiments. Transcription factors that were used in these experiments are expressed in the retina and brain and belong to different classes. Brn1 and Brn3B are the POU-domain transcription factors. Brn1 gene is prominently expressed in the embryonic brain (49He X. Treacy M.N. Simmons D.M. Ingraham H.A. Swanson L.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1989; 340: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), whereas Brn3b is specifically expressed in the retinal ganglion cells and regulates the expression of genes critical for axon formation (50Xiang M. Zhou L. Peng Y.W. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Nathans J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 689-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 51Gan L. Wang S.W. Huang Z. Klein W.H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 469-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Brn3b did not show significant stimulation of the p2829OPT promoter activity in co-transfection experiments when compared with pGL3 vector (Fig. 2D). Brn1 showed 4.8-fold stimulation of the p2829OPT in comparison with pGL3 (2.0-fold). Brn1 showed a similar 4.8-fold stimulation of the p136OPT (not shown). However, we were unable to identify a putative Brn1 binding site in the Optimedin proximal promoter. Math5 and NeuroD belong to a family of basic helix loop helix transcription factors and are required for retinal ganglion (Math5) and amacrine (NeuroD) cell development (see Ref. 52Hatakeyama J. Kageyama R. Semin. Cell. Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar for review). Neither Math5 nor NeuroD stimulated the p2829OPT promoter (Fig. 2D). Six5 is a member of the Six family of transcription factors. It is expressed in the ganglion and inner nuclear layers of the retina (53Sato S. Nakamura M. Cho D.H. Tapscott S.J. Ozaki H. Kawakami K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1045-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A putative Six5 binding site, 5′-TCAAGTTGC-3′, was identified in the Optimedin proximal promoter at the –104/–95 position. It is a perfect match to the consensus Six5 binding site, TCARRTTKC, where R is G or A and K is G or T (53Sato S. Nakamura M. Cho D.H. Tapscott S.J. Ozaki H. Kawakami K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1045-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, Six5 did not show significant stimulation of the p2829 promoter (Fig. 2D).

https://openalex.org/W2092404985,"The peptide specificity of HLA-B*1403, an allotype associated with ankylosing spondylitis (Lopez-Larrea, C., Mijiyawa, M., Gonzalez, S., Fernandez-Morera, J. L., Blanco-Gelaz, M. A., Martinez-Borra, J., and Lopez-Vazquez, A. (2002) Arthritis Rheum. 46, 2968–2971) was compared with those of the non-associated B*1402 and the prototypic disease-associated B*2705 allotypes. Although differing by a single residue (L156R), B*1402 and B*1403 shared only 32–35% of their peptide repertoires. Subtype-related differences observed in multiple peptide positions, including P3 and P7, were largely explained by a direct effect of the L156R change on peptide specificity. The HLA-B14 subtypes shared only ∼3% of their peptide repertoires with B*2705. This was due to distinct residue usage at most positions, as revealed by statistical comparison of B*1402, B*1403, and B*2705-bound nonamers. Nevertheless, shared ligands between B*2705 and B*1403 were formally identified, although ligands common to B*2705 and B*1403, but absent from B*1402, were not found. Alloreactive T-cells were used as a tool to analyze epitope sharing among B*1402, B*1403, and B*2705. The percentage of cross-reactive T-cell clones closely paralleled peptide overlap, suggesting that shared ligands tend to maintain their antigenic features when bound to the different allotypes. Our results indicate that B*1403 and B*2705 can present common peptides. However, both the disparity of their peptide repertoires and the lack of binding features shared by these two allotypes, but not B*1402, argue against, although do not exclude, a mechanism of spondyloarthritis mediated by specific ligands of B*2705 and B*1403.

Med. 1973; 288: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The property of HLA-B27 that determines disease susceptibility remains unknown, and several pathogenetic mechanisms are currently being considered as a basis for various research lines (3Ramos M. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 2002; 60: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Colbert R.A. Curr. Mol. Med. 2004; 4: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One of these mechanisms is proposed by the arthritogenic peptide hypothesis (5Benjamin R. Parham P. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 137-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), which assumes that an initial pathogenetic event would be a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against an external antigen, whose molecular mimicry with a constitutive peptide ligand of HLA-B27 would elicit an autoimmune reaction against this molecule, leading to tissue damage and inflammation. This hypothesis, which emphasizes the antigen-presenting specificity of HLA-B27 as a critical pathogenetic feature, has stimulated studies on the nature of HLA-B27-bound peptide repertoires and their relationship to those presented by other class I molecules. A major feature of HLA-B27 ligands is the presence of R2 (6Jardetzky T.S. Lane W.S. Robinson R.A. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C.

Because this pocket is made up of residues that are polymorphic among HLA class I molecules, few allotypes other than HLA-B27 bind peptides with R2. For this reason, it was of interest that B*3901, an allotype that also accepts peptides with this motif (10Falk K. Rotzschke O. Takiguchi M. Gnau V. Stevanovic S. Jung G. Rammensee H.G.

In Caucasoid patients, HLA-B39 was associated with the axial type of psoriatic arthritis (13Crivellato E. Zacchi T. Acta Derm. Venereol. 1987; 67: 249-250PubMed Google Scholar), a form of this disease that is strongly linked to HLA-B27 (14Khan M.A. Ann. Intern.

In addition, development of spondyloarthropathies in gorillas has been correlated with these animals expressing MHC class I molecules that bind peptides with R2 (15Urvater J.A. Hickman H. Dzuris J.L.

Of 7 HLA-B27-negative AS patients that could be clinically and genetically evaluated, 4 (57%) were of the B*1403 allotype. The prevalence of this allotype in the normal Togolese population was <1%. The closely related allotype B*1402, which differs from B*1403 only at residue 156 (Leu in B*1402; Arg in B*1403), was found in 2% of the healthy controls, but was absent among AS patients. B*1402 has a wide-spread distribution, including among Caucasians, and has never been found associated with AS. Sequence analysis of B*1402-bound peptides (18DiBrino M. Parker K.C. Margulies D.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32426-32434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed a strong preference of this allotype for peptides with R2. Because the B pockets of B*1402 and B*1403 are identical, it was expected that this allotype would also bind peptides with this motif. The availability of two closely related HLA-B14 molecules differentially associated with AS, allowed us for the first time to look for peptide differences that may correlate with disease susceptibility in a non-B27 system. It was also possible to look for similarities in peptide presentation between HLA-B27 and another relatively distant but AS-associated class I molecule, because B*1403 differs from B*2705 in 15 amino acid residues in the extracellular region of the molecule, all of which are located in the α1 and α2 domains. Thus, in this study we comparatively analyzed the peptide binding specificity of B*1402 and B*1403, to determine the overlap between their constitutive peptide repertoires and the structural features of shared and differentially bound ligands. We also determined that peptide sharing between B*1403 and B*2705 is very low, although both allotypes bind some common ligands, and defined the molecular basis of their differential peptide specificity. Finally, alloreactive CTLs, which recognize a wide spectrum of the peptides constitutively bound to the allo-MHC molecule (19Heath W.R. Kane K.P. Mescher M.F. Sherman L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 1091-1097PubMed Google Scholar), were used to analyze the relationship between epitope and peptide sharing among B*1402, B*1403, and B*2705. Cell Lines and DNA-mediated Gene Transfer—HMy2.C1R (C1R) is a human lymphoid cell line with low expression of its endogenous HLA class I molecules (22Storkus W.J. Howell D.N. Salter R.D. Dawson J.R. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1657-1659PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zemmour J. Little A.M. Schendel D.J. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1941-1948PubMed Google Scholar). B*2705-C1R transfectants with high expression of HLA-B27 were described elsewhere (24Calvo V. Rojo S. Lopez D. Galocha B. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4038-4045PubMed Google Scholar). C1R transfectant cells expressing B*1402 and B*1403 were obtained as follows. RNA was purified from the lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) R56 (HLA-A2, A11); B*1402, B*2702). Full-length cDNA of B*1402 was obtained by PCR, using two HLA-B locus-specific primers hybridizing in the 5′-flanking and 3′-untranslated regions, respectively. The DNA fragment was cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), sequenced to confirm that it corresponded to the correct B*1402 sequence, subsequently cloned into pCDNAIII (Invitrogen), sequenced again, and transfected into C1R cells by electroporation at 250 V and 960 microfarads, as previously described (24Calvo V. Rojo S. Lopez D. Galocha B. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4038-4045PubMed Google Scholar). One single nucleotide change, at codon 156, differentiates B*1403 from B*1402 (CTG to CGG). The gene encoding B*1403 was obtained by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis of the B*1402 cDNA obtained from R56 cells. Two independent PCR reactions were performed. In the first one, an oligonucleotide hybridizing in the 5′-end region and an “upstream” primer containing the desired mutation were used. The second PCR reaction used an oligonucleotide hybridizing in the 3′-untranslated region and a “downstream” primer with the mutation. A third PCR reaction was then performed using both DNA fragments and cDNA from R56. The full-length cDNA fragment obtained was cloned into pCRII and fully sequenced to confirm that it corresponded to the B*1403 gene. Finally, the gene was cloned into pCDNAIII and sequenced again before transfecting it into C1R cells as above. These cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (both from Invitrogen). Monoclonal Antibodies—The mAbs used in this study were W6/32 (IgG2a, specific for a monomorphic HLA class I determinant) (25Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Ziegler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar) and BBM1 (IgG2b, specific for human β2m) (26Brodsky F.M. Bodmer W.F. Parham P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1979; 9: 536-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—About 6 × 104 untransfected or B*1402-, B*1403-, or B*2705-C1R-transfectant cells were washed twice in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 50 μl of undiluted mAb supernatant. After incubating for 30 min, cells were washed twice in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 50 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG rabbit antiserum (Calbiochem-Norabiochem GMBH, Schwalbach, Germany), incubated for 30 min, and washed twice in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. All operations were done at 4 °C. Flow cytometry was done in an Epics Profile XL instrument (Coulter Electronics Inc., Hialeah, FL), using the System II software. Isolation of B*1402-, B*1403-, and B*2705-bound Peptides—B27- and B14-bound peptides were isolated from about 1010 of the corresponding C1R transfectant cells as previously described (27Paradela A. Garcia-Peydro M. Vazquez J. Rognan D. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5481-5490PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, cell lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography using the W6/32 mAb. HLA-B27- and HLA-B14-bound peptide pools were eluted with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature, filtered through Centricon 3 (Amicon, Beverly, MA), concentrated, and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fractionation. This was conducted in a Waters Alliance system (Waters Milford, MA) using a Vydac 218TP52 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) at a flow rate of 100 μl/min, as previously described (28Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fractions of 50 μl were collected. Mass Spectrometry Analysis and Sequencing—The peptide composition of HPLC fractions was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS using a Bruker Reflex™ III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytic GmbH, Bremen, Germany) equipped with the SCOUT™ source in positive ion reflector mode. Dried fractions were resuspended in 0.5 μl of 33% aqueous acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. This was deposited onto the stainless steel MALDI probe and allowed to dry at room temperature. Then 0.5 μl of matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 33% aqueous acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at 1 mg/ml was added, and the mixture was allowed to dry again at room temperature. Peptide sequencing was carried out by quadrupole ion trap nanoelectrospray MS/MS in an LCQ instrument (Finnigan TermoQuest, San Jose, CA), exactly as detailed elsewhere (29Yague J. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1998; 52: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Marina A. Garcia M.A. Albar J.P. Yague J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Vazquez J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Some sequences were obtained using an Esquire 3000Plus ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker) after online chromatographic separation of samples as follows. Samples were dissolved in Buffer A (0.5% acetic acid in water) and loaded onto a column (100 mm × 100 μm internal diameter) packed with 5 μm Kromasil C18 beads (EKA Chemicals, Bohus, Sweden) and fractionated in a Famos-Switchos-Ultimate chromatographic system (LCPackings, the Netherlands) with a 45-min linear gradient of 5–30% Buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid in water) at 500 nl/min. MS/MS spectra were acquired by automatic switching between MS and MS/MS mode using dynamic exclusion. Some samples were analyzed using the Multiple Reaction Monitoring mode, which allows specific peptide masses to be selected. The interpretation of MS/MS spectra was done manually, but assisted by various software packages, including Mascot (Matrix Science Ltd., London) and MSProduct, a facility of the Protein Prospector package (31Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). In addition, the FASTA software (www.ebi.ac.uk./fasta33/index.html) was used to look for unambiguous matching of candidate peptide sequences with the human genome and proteome databases. CTL—Alloreactive CTL clones directed against B*1402 were obtained from various unrelated HLA-B14-negative donors upon stimulation with the LCL LWAGS (HLA-A*3301, B*1402) as follows. About 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated in vitro with a mixture of 105 stimulator LCL and 106 autologous PBMC feeder cells irradiated at 80 and 50 Gy, respectively. After a week cells were directly cloned by seeding serial dilutions of stimulated T cells in U-bottomed 96-well plates containing 2,000 irradiated stimulator LCL and 20,000 irradiated PBMCs per well in the presence of 30 units/ml recombinant interleukin-2 (a kind gift of Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ). Cells in wells growing below the statistical limit of clonality were tested for HLA-B14 reactivity, using a standard 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay against B*1402-CIR targets, and untransfected CIR cells as a negative control. Mixed lymphocyte cultures were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with Glutamax I (Invitrogen), supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin (all from Sigma-Aldrich) and 14% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). T-cell clones were grown in the same medium and restimulated weekly in the presence of interleukin-2, as described above. Alloreactive CTL clones directed against B*2705 were obtained by the same procedure, with the following modifications. PBMCs from various unrelated HLA-B27-negative donors were stimulated in vitro with either the R15 (HLA-A3, B*2705, B35) or LG15 (HLA-A32, B*2705) LCL for a week, re-stimulated with the alternative LCL in secondary mixed lymphocyte culture for another week, and cloned with the initial LCL by limiting dilution. Other previously described B*2705-specific CTL clones were also used (32Lopez D. Garcia Hoyo R. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5557-5571PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—This was carried out by the χ2 with Yates correction or the Fisher's exact test, depending on the size of the samples being compared. p values of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Large Disparity between the Constitutive Peptide Repertoires of B*1402 and B*1403—The peptide pools from both subtypes were isolated, after immunoaffinity purification with W6/32 and acid extraction, from the corresponding C1R transfectant cells, whose surface expression of B*1402 and B*1403 was very similar (Fig. 1). Both peptide pools were fractionated by HPLC in consecutive runs under identical conditions, and each of the peptide-containing fractions was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The MS spectrum of each HPLC fraction from one subtype was compared with the correlative, previous, and following fractions from the other subtype, to take into account small shifts in the retention time of peptides that may occur even in consecutive chromatographic runs. Ion peaks with the same (±0.8) mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio in this comparison, were considered to reflect identical ligands of both subtypes. Ion peaks found in only one peptide pool were considered to reflect subtype-specific ligands. This strategy has been previously used to determine the overlap between HLA-B27 subtype-bound peptide repertoires in several studies from our laboratory (33Sesma L. Montserrat V. Lamas J.R. Marina A.

Two independent comparisons were carried out, and the overlap between the B*1402 and B*1403 peptide repertoires was established as the mean of the two experiments (TABLE ONE). On the basis of this analysis B*1402 and B*1403 shared only ∼32–35% of their peptide repertoires. The peptide size distribution in both pools was very similar and showed a Gaussian distribution typical of MHC class I-bound peptides (Fig. 2A), with an average molecular mass of 1113 and 1109 Da for B*1402 and B*1403, respectively. Moreover, both the average molecular mass (TABLE ONE) and size distribution (Fig. 2B) of subtype-specific ligands were very similar between both sets. These results indicate that, despite their close structural similarity, B*1402 and B*1403 bind largely distinct peptide repertoires, although this has little effect on peptide size.TABLE ONEComparison of natural peptide ligands from B*1402 and B*1403Exp. 1Exp.2MeanB*1402B*1403B*1402B*1403B*1402B*1403Total peptides compared782742909800846771Shared peptides319 (41%)319 (43%)225 (25%)225 (28%)272 (32%)272 (35%)Differential peptides463 (59%)423 (57%)684 (75%)575 (72%)574 (68%)499 (65%)Average mass of total peptides1113 Da1104 Da1112 Da1114 Da1113 Da1109 DaAverage mass of shared peptides1100 Da1100 Da1092 Da1092 Da1096 Da1096 DaAverage mass of differential peptides1122 Da1108 Da1119 Da1123 Da1121 Da1116 Da Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Size distribution of B*1402-, B*1403-, and B*2705-bound peptides.

B*1402 and B*1403 differed from B*2705 in 88 and 85% of their peptide repertoires, respectively (TABLE TWO). This is a minimum estimation, because a comparison based on retention times and molecular mass becomes more inaccurate in reflecting peptide identity, the more different are the peptide pools compared. Indeed, of six peptide pairs showing the same retention time and molecular mass that were sequenced from both B*1403 and B*2705 (see below), 2 (33.3%) and 4 (66.7%) corresponded to identical and different peptides, respectively. If these results are extrapolated to the total peptide pool, the actual overlap of the B*2705-bound peptide repertoire with that of B*1403 would be (8 × 0.333)% = 2.7%, and the overlap of the B*1403-bound repertoire with that of B*2705 would be (15 × 0.333)% = 5%.TABLE TWOComparison of natural peptide ligands from B*1402, B*1403 and B*2705Exp. 1Exp. 2MeanB*1402/B*2705B*1402B*2705B*1402B*2705B*1402B*2705Total peptides compared782113290915538461343Shared peptides90 (12%)90 (8%)114 (13%)114 (7%)102 (12%)102 (8%)Differential peptides692 (88%)1042 (92%)795 (87%)1439 (93%)744 (88%)1241 (92%)Average mass of total peptides1113 Da1216 Da1112 Da1227 Da1113 Da1222 DaAverage mass of shared peptides1136 Da1136 Da1118 Da1118 Da1127 Da1127 DaAverage mass of differential peptides1110 Da1223 Da1112 Da1236 Da1111 Da1230 DaB*1403/B*2705B*1403B*2705B*1403B*2705B*1403B*2705Total peptides compared739113277615537581343Shared peptides125 (17%)125 (11%)95 (12%)95 (6%)110 (15%)110 (8%)Differential peptides614 (83%)1007 (89%)681 (88%)1458 (94%)648 (85%)1233 (92%)Average mass of total peptides1105 Da1216 Da1115 Da1227 Da1110 Da1222 DaAverage mass of shared peptides1132 Da1132 Da1157 Da1157 Da1145 Da1145 DaAverage mass of differential peptides1100 Da1227 Da1109 Da1232 Da1105 Da1230 Da Open table in a new tab The average molecular mass of the total B*2705-bound peptides was significantly higher (1222 Da) than those of B*1402 or B*1403 ligands (1113 and 1110 Da, respectively), suggesting notorious differences in side-chain composition, peptide length or both between the B14 and B27-bound peptide repertoires (Fig. 2A). This was clear from the size distribution of the differential peptides between B*2705 and B*1402 or B*1403 (Fig. 2C): B14-specific peptides predominated in the lower mass range, and the opposite was true for B*2705-specific ligands. Peptides shared between B*2705 and B*1402 or B*1403 had an average molecular mass (1127 and 1145 Da, respectively) somewhat higher than the total B*1402 or B*1403 ligands and clearly below the total B*2705 ligands (TABLE TWO). The number of ion peaks counted from B*1402 and B*1403 were consistently lower than those from B*2705 in all experiments (TABLE TWO). There are several possible explanations for this result. First, it might be a consequence of the higher surface expression of HLA-B27, relative to HLA-B14 subtypes (Fig. 1). However, this possibility was not supported by the fact that the global peptide yields of the B27- and B14-bound pools were similar (data not shown). Second, a significant fraction of the B14-bound peptides might not dissolve in the aqueous trifluoroacetic acid used for peptide extraction. This is also very unlikely, because trifluoroacetic acid is a very efficient solvent for short peptides, in the range of the MHC class I ligands, whose neat charge is always positive, because the acidic groups are uncharged at acidic pH. Third, a significantly higher number of B14 than B*2705 ligands might escape detection by MALDI-TOF MS due to lower positive charge. Although there is no obvious reason for this, we have not experimentally addressed this possibility and cannot formally rule it out. Finally, it is possible that the B14-bound peptide repertoire is actually smaller than that of B*2705. This might result from restricted residue usage at a large number of peptide positions among B*1402 and B*1403 ligands (see below). Taken together, these results indicate that B*2705 shares with B*1402 and B*1403 only a small fraction of its constitutive peptide repertoire, and that it binds peptides with higher molecular mass. Our results are also consistent with the possibility that the B*2705-bound peptide repertoire is larger than those of B*1402 and B*1403. B*1402 and B*1403 Ligands Show Restricted Heterogeneity at Multiple Peptide Positions—A total of 34 HLA-B14 ligands were sequenced by electrospray MS/MS. These include 17 shared ligands of both subtypes, 7 B*1402-specific, and 10 B*1403-specific peptides (Fig. 3). To establish the peptide motifs of both subtypes we analyzed the frequency of each amino acid residue at each position among all the nonamers from each subtype, because they were the only ones to provide significant numbers of peptides with the same size. Thus, the peptide motifs of B*1402 were determined from 16 ligands, including the 11 shared and the 5 B*1402-specific nonamers. Similarly, the peptide motifs of B*1403 were established from 19 ligands, including the 11 shared and the 8 B*1403-specific nonamers. A peptide position was arbitrarily considered to show restricted heterogeneity when a given residue or type of chemically analogous residues (i.e. acidic, basic, polar, aliphatic, or aromatic) appeared at that position in at least 40% of the nonamers from a given subtype (Fig. 4). On this basis B*1402 and B*1403 showed skewed residue usage at 6 and 8 of the 9 peptide positions, respectively. Both subtypes had 4 positions with the same predominant motifs: P2 (Arg), P5 (Arg), P8 (polar residues), and P9 (aliphatic residues, mainly Leu). Except P9, which was fully restricted to aliphatic/aromatic residues, the other positions tolerated multiple residue types. Both subtypes had also in common a lack of significant restric"
https://openalex.org/W2085946372,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV) encodes a D-like cyclin (K-cyclin) that is thought to contribute to the viral oncogenicity. K-cyclin activates cellular cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6, generating enzymes with a substrate selectivity deviant from CDK4 and CDK6 activated by D-type cyclins, suggesting different biochemical and biological functions. Here we report the identification of the actin- and calmodulin-binding protein caldesmon (CALD1) as a novel K-cyclin·CDK substrate, which is not phosphorylated by D·CDK. CALD1 plays a central role in the regulation of microfilament organization, consequently controlling cell shape, adhesion, cytokinesis and motility. K-cyclin·CDK6 specifically phosphorylates four Ser/Thr sites in the human CALD1 carboxyl terminus, abolishing CALD1 binding to its effector protein, actin, and its regulator protein, calmodulin. CALD1 is hyperphosphorylated in cells following K-cyclin expression and in KSHV-transformed lymphoma cells. Moreover, expression of exogenous K-cyclin results in microfilament loss and changes in cell morphology; both effects are reliant on CDK catalysis and can be reversed by the expression of a phosphorylation defective CALD1. Together, these data strongly suggest that K-cyclin expression modulates the activity of caldesmon and through this the microfilament functions in cells. These results establish a novel link between KSHV infection and the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton."
