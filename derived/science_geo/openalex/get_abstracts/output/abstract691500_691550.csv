https://openalex.org/W4225890110,"SARS-CoV-2 can cause acute respiratory distress and death in some patients1. Although severe COVID-19 is linked to substantial inflammation, how SARS-CoV-2 triggers inflammation is not clear2. Monocytes and macrophages are sentinel cells that sense invasive infection to form inflammasomes that activate caspase-1 and gasdermin D, leading to inflammatory death (pyroptosis) and the release of potent inflammatory mediators3. Here we show that about 6% of blood monocytes of patients with COVID-19 are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Monocyte infection depends on the uptake of antibody-opsonized virus by Fcγ receptors. The plasma of vaccine recipients does not promote antibody-dependent monocyte infection. SARS-CoV-2 begins to replicate in monocytes, but infection is aborted, and infectious virus is not detected in the supernatants of cultures of infected monocytes. Instead, infected cells undergo pyroptosis mediated by activation of NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, caspase-1 and gasdermin D. Moreover, tissue-resident macrophages, but not infected epithelial and endothelial cells, from lung autopsies from patients with COVID-19 have activated inflammasomes. Taken together, these findings suggest that antibody-mediated SARS-CoV-2 uptake by monocytes and macrophages triggers inflammatory cell death that aborts the production of infectious virus but causes systemic inflammation that contributes to COVID-19 pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4224314218,"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are distinguished from other organic polymers by their crystallinity1-3, but it remains challenging to obtain robust, highly crystalline COFs because the framework-forming reactions are poorly reversible4,5. More reversible chemistry can improve crystallinity6-9, but this typically yields COFs with poor physicochemical stability and limited application scope5. Here we report a general and scalable protocol to prepare robust, highly crystalline imine COFs, based on an unexpected framework reconstruction. In contrast to standard approaches in which monomers are initially randomly aligned, our method involves the pre-organization of monomers using a reversible and removable covalent tether, followed by confined polymerization. This reconstruction route produces reconstructed COFs with greatly enhanced crystallinity and much higher porosity by means of a simple vacuum-free synthetic procedure. The increased crystallinity in the reconstructed COFs improves charge carrier transport, leading to sacrificial photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rates of up to 27.98 mmol h-1 g-1. This nanoconfinement-assisted reconstruction strategy is a step towards programming function in organic materials through atomistic structural control."
https://openalex.org/W4224014283,"Comprehensive genome annotation is essential to understand the impact of clinically relevant variants. However, the absence of a standard for clinical reporting and browser display complicates the process of consistent interpretation and reporting. To address these challenges, Ensembl/GENCODE1 and RefSeq2 launched a joint initiative, the Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) collaboration, to converge on human gene and transcript annotation and to jointly define a high-value set of transcripts and corresponding proteins. Here, we describe the MANE transcript sets for use as universal standards for variant reporting and browser display. The MANE Select set identifies a representative transcript for each human protein-coding gene, whereas the MANE Plus Clinical set provides additional transcripts at loci where the Select transcripts alone are not sufficient to report all currently known clinical variants. Each MANE transcript represents an exact match between the exonic sequences of an Ensembl/GENCODE transcript and its counterpart in RefSeq such that the identifiers can be used synonymously. We have now released MANE Select transcripts for 97% of human protein-coding genes, including all American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics Secondary Findings list v3.0 (ref. 3) genes. MANE transcripts are accessible from major genome browsers and key resources. Widespread adoption of these transcript sets will increase the consistency of reporting, facilitate the exchange of data regardless of the annotation source and help to streamline clinical interpretation."
https://openalex.org/W4224320536,"With the scaling of lateral dimensions in advanced transistors, an increased gate capacitance is desirable both to retain the control of the gate electrode over the channel and to reduce the operating voltage1. This led to a fundamental change in the gate stack in 2008, the incorporation of high-dielectric-constant HfO2 (ref. 2), which remains the material of choice to date. Here we report HfO2-ZrO2 superlattice heterostructures as a gate stack, stabilized with mixed ferroelectric-antiferroelectric order, directly integrated onto Si transistors, and scaled down to approximately 20 ångströms, the same gate oxide thickness required for high-performance transistors. The overall equivalent oxide thickness in metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors is equivalent to an effective SiO2 thickness of approximately 6.5 ångströms. Such a low effective oxide thickness and the resulting large capacitance cannot be achieved in conventional HfO2-based high-dielectric-constant gate stacks without scavenging the interfacial SiO2, which has adverse effects on the electron transport and gate leakage current3. Accordingly, our gate stacks, which do not require such scavenging, provide substantially lower leakage current and no mobility degradation. This work demonstrates that ultrathin ferroic HfO2-ZrO2 multilayers, stabilized with competing ferroelectric-antiferroelectric order in the two-nanometre-thickness regime, provide a path towards advanced gate oxide stacks in electronic devices beyond conventional HfO2-based high-dielectric-constant materials."

https://openalex.org/W4224317046,"Allosteric communication between distant sites in proteins is central to biological regulation but still poorly characterized, limiting understanding, engineering and drug development1-6. An important reason for this is the lack of methods to comprehensively quantify allostery in diverse proteins. Here we address this shortcoming and present a method that uses deep mutational scanning to globally map allostery. The approach uses an efficient experimental design to infer en masse the causal biophysical effects of mutations by quantifying multiple molecular phenotypes-here we examine binding and protein abundance-in multiple genetic backgrounds and fitting thermodynamic models using neural networks. We apply the approach to two of the most common protein interaction domains found in humans, an SH3 domain and a PDZ domain, to produce comprehensive atlases of allosteric communication. Allosteric mutations are abundant, with a large mutational target space of network-altering 'edgetic' variants. Mutations are more likely to be allosteric closer to binding interfaces, at glycine residues and at specific residues connecting to an opposite surface within the PDZ domain. This general approach of quantifying mutational effects for multiple molecular phenotypes and in multiple genetic backgrounds should enable the energetic and allosteric landscapes of many proteins to be rapidly and comprehensively mapped."
https://openalex.org/W4224321386,"Abstract The possibility that neutrinos may be their own antiparticles, unique among the known fundamental particles, arises from the symmetric theory of fermions proposed by Ettore Majorana in 1937 1 . Given the profound consequences of such Majorana neutrinos, among which is a potential explanation for the matter–antimatter asymmetry of the universe via leptogenesis 2 , the Majorana nature of neutrinos commands intense experimental scrutiny globally; one of the primary experimental probes is neutrinoless double beta (0 νββ ) decay. Here we show results from the search for 0 νββ decay of 130 Te, using the latest advanced cryogenic calorimeters with the CUORE experiment 3 . CUORE, operating just 10 millikelvin above absolute zero, has pushed the state of the art on three frontiers: the sheer mass held at such ultralow temperatures, operational longevity, and the low levels of ionizing radiation emanating from the cryogenic infrastructure. We find no evidence for 0 νββ decay and set a lower bound of the process half-life as 2.2 × 10 25 years at a 90 per cent credibility interval. We discuss potential applications of the advances made with CUORE to other fields such as direct dark matter, neutrino and nuclear physics searches and large-scale quantum computing, which can benefit from sustained operation of large payloads in a low-radioactivity, ultralow-temperature cryogenic environment."
https://openalex.org/W4223979581,"Horizontal gene transfer can trigger rapid shifts in bacterial evolution. Driven by a variety of mobile genetic elements-in particular bacteriophages and plasmids-the ability to share genes within and across species underpins the exceptional adaptability of bacteria. Nevertheless, invasive mobile genetic elements can also present grave risks to the host; bacteria have therefore evolved a vast array of defences against these elements1. Here we identify two plasmid defence systems conserved in the Vibrio cholerae El Tor strains responsible for the ongoing seventh cholera pandemic2-4. These systems, termed DdmABC and DdmDE, are encoded on two major pathogenicity islands that are a hallmark of current pandemic strains. We show that the modules cooperate to rapidly eliminate small multicopy plasmids by degradation. Moreover, the DdmABC system is widespread and can defend against bacteriophage infection by triggering cell suicide (abortive infection, or Abi). Notably, we go on to show that, through an Abi-like mechanism, DdmABC increases the burden of large low-copy-number conjugative plasmids, including a broad-host IncC multidrug resistance plasmid, which creates a fitness disadvantage that counterselects against plasmid-carrying cells. Our results answer the long-standing question of why plasmids, although abundant in environmental strains, are rare in pandemic strains; have implications for understanding the dissemination of antibiotic resistance plasmids; and provide insights into how the interplay between two defence systems has shaped the evolution of the most successful lineage of pandemic V. cholerae."
https://openalex.org/W4224211890,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an adaptor protein in innate immunity against DNA viruses or bacteria1–5. STING-mediated immunity could be exploited in the development of vaccines or cancer immunotherapies. STING is a transmembrane dimeric protein that is located in the endoplasmic reticulum or in the Golgi apparatus. STING is activated by the binding of its cytoplasmic ligand-binding domain to cyclic dinucleotides that are produced by the DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase or by invading bacteria1,6,7. Cyclic dinucleotides induce a conformational change in the STING ligand-binding domain, which leads to a high-order oligomerization of STING that is essential for triggering the downstream signalling pathways8,9. However, the cGAMP-induced STING oligomers tend to dissociate in solution and have not been resolved to high resolution, which limits our understanding of the activation mechanism. Here we show that a small-molecule agonist, compound 53 (C53)10, promotes the oligomerization and activation of human STING through a mechanism orthogonal to that of cGAMP. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of STING bound to both C53 and cGAMP, revealing a stable oligomer that is formed by side-by-side packing and has a curled overall shape. Notably, C53 binds to a cryptic pocket in the STING transmembrane domain, between the two subunits of the STING dimer. This binding triggers outward shifts of transmembrane helices in the dimer, and induces inter-dimer interactions between these helices to mediate the formation of the high-order oligomer. Our functional analyses show that cGAMP and C53 together induce stronger activation of STING than either ligand alone. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of human STING bound to both cyclic GMP-AMP and the small-molecule agonist C53 reveals an agonist-binding site in the STING transmembrane domain, and provides insight into the oligomerization and activation of STING."
https://openalex.org/W4224094774,"The brain consists of thousands of neuronal types that are generated by stem cells producing different neuronal types as they age. In Drosophila, this temporal patterning is driven by the successive expression of temporal transcription factors (tTFs)1-6. Here we used single-cell mRNA sequencing to identify the complete series of tTFs that specify most Drosophila optic lobe neurons. We verify that tTFs regulate the progression of the series by activating the next tTF(s) and repressing the previous one(s), and also identify more complex mechanisms of regulation. Moreover, we establish the temporal window of origin and birth order of each neuronal type in the medulla and provide evidence that these tTFs are sufficient to explain the generation of all of the neuronal diversity in this brain region. Finally, we describe the first steps of neuronal differentiation and show that these steps are conserved in humans. We find that terminal differentiation genes, such as neurotransmitter-related genes, are present as transcripts, but not as proteins, in immature larval neurons. This comprehensive analysis of a temporal series of tTFs in the optic lobe offers mechanistic insights into how tTF series are regulated, and how they can lead to the generation of a complete set of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W4224325164,"Biology operates through autonomous chemically fuelled molecular machinery1, including rotary motors such as adenosine triphosphate synthase2 and the bacterial flagellar motor3. Chemists have long sought to create analogous molecular structures with chemically powered, directionally rotating, components4-17. However, synthetic motor molecules capable of autonomous 360° directional rotation about a single bond have proved elusive, with previous designs lacking either autonomous fuelling7,10,12 or directionality6. Here we show that 1-phenylpyrrole 2,2'-dicarboxylic acid18,19 (1a) is a catalysis-driven20,21 motor that can continuously transduce energy from a chemical fuel9,20-27 to induce repetitive 360° directional rotation of the two aromatic rings around the covalent N-C bond that connects them. On treatment of 1a with a carbodiimide21,25-27, intramolecular anhydride formation between the rings and the anhydride's hydrolysis both occur incessantly. Both reactions are kinetically gated28-30 causing directional bias. Accordingly, catalysis of carbodiimide hydration by the motor molecule continuously drives net directional rotation around the N-C bond. The directionality is determined by the handedness of both an additive that accelerates anhydride hydrolysis and that of the fuel, and is easily reversed additive31. More than 97% of fuel molecules are consumed through the chemical engine cycle24 with a directional bias of up to 71:29 with a chirality-matched fuel and additive. In other words, the motor makes a 'mistake' in direction every three to four turns. The 26-atom motor molecule's simplicity augurs well for its structural optimization and the development of derivatives that can be interfaced with other components for the performance of work and tasks32-36."
https://openalex.org/W4224318897,"Chiral amine diastereomers are ubiquitous in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals1, yet their preparation often relies on low-efficiency multi-step synthesis2. These valuable compounds must be manufactured asymmetrically, as their biochemical properties can differ based on the chirality of the molecule. Herein we characterize a multifunctional biocatalyst for amine synthesis, which operates using a mechanism that is, to our knowledge, previously unreported. This enzyme (EneIRED), identified within a metagenomic imine reductase (IRED) collection3 and originating from an unclassified Pseudomonas species, possesses an unusual active site architecture that facilitates amine-activated conjugate alkene reduction followed by reductive amination. This enzyme can couple a broad selection of α,β-unsaturated carbonyls with amines for the efficient preparation of chiral amine diastereomers bearing up to three stereocentres. Mechanistic and structural studies have been carried out to delineate the order of individual steps catalysed by EneIRED, which have led to a proposal for the overall catalytic cycle. This work shows that the IRED family can serve as a platform for facilitating the discovery of further enzymatic activities for application in synthetic biology and organic synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4223900539,"Mammalian embryogenesis requires rapid growth and proper metabolic regulation1. Midgestation features increasing oxygen and nutrient availability concomitant with fetal organ development2,3. Understanding how metabolism supports development requires approaches to observe metabolism directly in model organisms in utero. Here we used isotope tracing and metabolomics to identify evolving metabolic programmes in the placenta and embryo during midgestation in mice. These tissues differ metabolically throughout midgestation, but we pinpointed gestational days (GD) 10.5-11.5 as a transition period for both placenta and embryo. Isotope tracing revealed differences in carbohydrate metabolism between the tissues and rapid glucose-dependent purine synthesis, especially in the embryo. Glucose's contribution to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle rises throughout midgestation in the embryo but not in the placenta. By GD12.5, compartmentalized metabolic programmes are apparent within the embryo, including different nutrient contributions to the TCA cycle in different organs. To contextualize developmental anomalies associated with Mendelian metabolic defects, we analysed mice deficient in LIPT1, the enzyme that activates 2-ketoacid dehydrogenases related to the TCA cycle4,5. LIPT1 deficiency suppresses TCA cycle metabolism during the GD10.5-GD11.5 transition, perturbs brain, heart and erythrocyte development and leads to embryonic demise by GD11.5. These data document individualized metabolic programmes in developing organs in utero."
https://openalex.org/W4224006395,"Abstract G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are cell-surface receptors that respond to various stimuli to induce signalling pathways across cell membranes. Recent progress has yielded atomic structures of key intermediates 1,2 and roles for lipids in signalling 3,4 . However, capturing signalling events of a wild-type receptor in real time, across a native membrane to its downstream effectors, has remained elusive. Here we probe the archetypal class A GPCR, rhodopsin, directly from fragments of native disc membranes using mass spectrometry. We monitor real-time photoconversion of dark-adapted rhodopsin to opsin, delineating retinal isomerization and hydrolysis steps, and further showing that the reaction is significantly slower in its native membrane than in detergent micelles. Considering the lipids ejected with rhodopsin, we demonstrate that opsin can be regenerated in membranes through photoisomerized retinal–lipid conjugates, and we provide evidence for increased association of rhodopsin with unsaturated long-chain phosphatidylcholine during signalling. Capturing the secondary steps of the signalling cascade, we monitor light activation of transducin (G t ) through loss of GDP to generate an intermediate apo-trimeric G protein, and observe Gα t •GTP subunits interacting with PDE6 to hydrolyse cyclic GMP. We also show how rhodopsin-targeting compounds either stimulate or dampen signalling through rhodopsin–opsin and transducin signalling pathways. Our results not only reveal the effect of native lipids on rhodopsin signalling and regeneration but also enable us to propose a paradigm for GPCR drug discovery in native membrane environments."
https://openalex.org/W4225256695,"Schistosomes cause morbidity and death throughout the developing world due to the massive numbers of eggs female worms deposit into the blood of their host. Studies dating back to the 1920s show that female schistosomes rely on constant physical contact with a male worm both to become and remain sexually mature; however, the molecular details governing this process remain elusive. Here, we uncover a nonribosomal peptide synthetase that is induced in male worms upon pairing with a female and find that it is essential for the ability of male worms to stimulate female development. We demonstrate that this enzyme generates β-alanyl-tryptamine that is released by paired male worms. Furthermore, synthetic β-alanyl-tryptamine can replace male worms to stimulate female sexual development and egg laying. These data reveal that peptide-based pheromone signaling controls female schistosome sexual maturation, suggesting avenues for therapeutic intervention and uncovering a role for nonribosomal peptides as metazoan signaling molecules."
https://openalex.org/W4225377302,"Aerosols have been found to be nearly ubiquitous in substellar atmospheres1-3. The precise temperature at which these aerosols begin to form in exoplanets has yet to be observationally constrained. Theoretical models and observations of muted spectral features indicate that silicate clouds play an important role in exoplanets between at least 950 and 2,100 K (ref. 4). Some giant planets, however, are thought to be hot enough to avoid condensation altogether5,6. Here we report the near-ultraviolet transmission spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-178b (approximately 2,450 K), which exhibits substantial absorption. Bayesian retrievals indicate the presence of gaseous refractory species containing silicon and magnesium, which are the precursors to condensate clouds at lower temperatures. SiO, in particular, has not previously, to our knowledge, been detected in exoplanets, but the presence of SiO in WASP-178b is consistent with theoretical expectations as the dominant Si-bearing species at high temperatures. These observations allow us to re-interpret previous observations of HAT-P-41b and WASP-121b that did not consider SiO, to suggest that silicate cloud formation begins on exoplanets with equilibrium temperatures between 1,950 and 2,450 K."
https://openalex.org/W4224063546,"The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria has an external leaflet that is largely composed of lipopolysaccharide, which provides a selective permeation barrier, particularly against antimicrobials1. The final and crucial step in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide is the addition of a species-dependent O-antigen to the lipid A core oligosaccharide, which is catalysed by the O-antigen ligase WaaL2. Here we present structures of WaaL from Cupriavidus metallidurans, both in the apo state and in complex with its lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The structures reveal that WaaL comprises 12 transmembrane helices and a predominantly α-helical periplasmic region, which we show contains many of the conserved residues that are required for catalysis. We observe a conserved fold within the GT-C family of glycosyltransferases and hypothesize that they have a common mechanism for shuttling the undecaprenyl-based carrier to and from the active site. The structures, combined with genetic, biochemical, bioinformatics and molecular dynamics simulation experiments, offer molecular details on how the ligands come in apposition, and allows us to propose a mechanistic model for catalysis. Together, our work provides a structural basis for lipopolysaccharide maturation in a member of the GT-C superfamily of glycosyltransferases. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the bacterial O-antigen ligase WaaL, combined with genetics, biochemistry and molecular dynamics simulations, provide insight into the mechanism by which WaaL catalyses the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide."

Cdiff infections are a leading cause of nosocomial deaths1. Fidaxomicin, which inhibits RNA polymerase, targets Cdiff with minimal effects on gut commensals, reducing recurrence of Cdiff infection2,3. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of Cdiff RNA polymerase in complex with fidaxomicin and identify a crucial fidaxomicin-binding determinant of Cdiff RNA polymerase that is absent in most gut microbiota such as Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. By combining structural, biochemical, genetic and bioinformatic analyses, we establish that a single residue in Cdiff RNA polymerase is a sensitizing element for fidaxomicin narrow-spectrum activity. Our results provide a blueprint for targeted drug design against an important human pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W4224225504,"Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) elements are circular DNA molecules that are derived from but are independent of chromosomal DNA. EccDNA is emerging as a rising star because of its ubiquitous existence in cancers and its crucial role in oncogene amplification and tumor progression. In the present study, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of cancer samples were downloaded from public repositories. Afterwards, eccDNAs were identified from WGS data via bioinformatic analyses. To leverage database coverage, eccDNAs were also collected by manual curation of literatures. Gene expression and clinical data were downloaded from TCGA and CCLE and then used to investigate the roles of eccDNAs in cancers. Finally, the first integrated database of eccDNAs, eccDNAdb, was developed. eccDNAdb currently includes 1270 eccDNAs, which were identified in 480 samples (of 42 cancers) after analyzing a total number of 3395 tumor samples (of 57 cancers) including patient tissues, patient-derived xenografts, and cancer cell lines. A total number of 54,901 eccDNA genes were annotated and included in the database as well. With the integration of gene expression, clinical information and chromatin accessibility data, eccDNAdb enables users to easily determine the biological function and clinical relevance of eccDNAs in human cancers. In conclusion, eccDNAdb is freely accessible at http://www.eccdnadb.org . To our knowledge, eccDNAdb is the first database in the eccDNA research field. It is expected to provide insight for novel cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4226513753,"Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a cytokine with various biological functions in immune regulation, hematopoiesis, and inflammation. Elevated IL-6 levels have been identified in several severe disorders such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and most recently, COVID-19. The biological activity of IL-6 relies on interactions with its specific receptor, IL-6Rα, including the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (mIL-6R) and the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). Thus, inhibition of the interaction between these two proteins would be a potential treatment for IL-6 related diseases. To date, no orally available small-molecule drug has been approved. This study focuses on finding potential small molecules that can inhibit protein-protein interactions between IL-6 and its receptor IL-6Rα using its crystal structure (PDB ID: 5FUC). First, two pharmacophore models were constructed based on the interactions between key residues of IL-6 (Phe74, Phe78, Leu178, Arg179, Arg182) and IL-6Rα (Phe229, Tyr230, Glu277, Glu278, Phe279). A database of approximately 22 million compounds was screened using 3D-pharmacophore models, molecular docking models, and ADMET properties. By analyzing the interactive capability of successfully docked compounds with important amino acids, 12 potential ligands were selected for further analysis via molecular dynamics simulations. Based on the stability of the complexes, the high interactions rate of each ligand with the key residues of IL-6/IL-6Rα, and the low binding free energy calculation, two compounds ZINC83804241 and ZINC02997430, were identified as the most potential IL-6 inhibitor candidates. These results will pave the way for the design and optimization of more specific compounds to combat cytokine storm in severe coronavirus patients."

https://openalex.org/W4226162713,"The representation of an animal's position in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is distributed across several modules of grid cells, each characterized by a distinct spatial scale. The population activity within each module is tightly coordinated and preserved across environments and behavioral states. Little is known, however, about the coordination of activity patterns across modules. We analyzed the joint activity patterns of hundreds of grid cells simultaneously recorded in animals that were foraging either in the light, when sensory cues could stabilize the representation, or in darkness, when such stabilization was disrupted. We found that the states of different modules are tightly coordinated, even in darkness, when the internal representation of position within the MEC deviates substantially from the true position of the animal. These findings suggest that internal brain mechanisms dynamically coordinate the representation of position in different modules, ensuring that they jointly encode a coherent and smooth trajectory."
https://openalex.org/W4225733922,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous malignancy characterized by the accumulation of undifferentiated white blood cells (blasts) in the bone marrow. Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is an abundant molecular chaperone that extracts ubiquitylated substrates from protein complexes and cellular compartments prior to their degradation by the proteasome. We found that treatment of AML cell lines with the VCP inhibitor CB-5083 leads to an accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins, activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) and apoptosis. Using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics we assessed the effects of VCP inhibition on the cellular ubiquitin-modified proteome. We could further show that CB-5083 decreases the survival of the AML cell lines THP-1 and MV4-11 in a concentration-dependent manner, and acts synergistically with the antimetabolite cytarabine and the BH3-mimetic venetoclax. Finally, we showed that prolonged treatment of AML cells with CB-5083 leads to development of resistance mediated by mutations in VCP. Taken together, inhibition of VCP leads to a lethal unfolded protein response in AML cells and might be a relevant therapeutic strategy for treatment of AML, particularly when combined with other drugs. The toxicity and development of resistance possibly limit the utility of VCP inhibitors and have to be further explored in animal models and clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W4226116560,"Raw honey contains a diverse microbiota originating from honeybees, plants, and soil. Some gram-positive bacteria isolated from raw honey are known for their ability to produce secondary metabolites that have the potential to be exploited as antimicrobial agents. Currently, there is a high demand for natural, broad-spectrum, and eco-friendly bio-fungicides in the food industry. Naturally occurring antifungal products from food-isolated bacteria are ideal candidates for agricultural applications. To obtain novel antifungals from natural sources, we isolated bacteria from raw clover and orange blossom honey to evaluate their antifungal-producing potential. Two Bacillus velezensis isolates showed strong antifungal activity against food-isolated fungal strains. Antifungal compound production was optimized by adjusting the growth conditions of these bacterial isolates. Extracellular proteinaceous compounds were purified via ammonium sulfate precipitation, solid phase extraction, and RP-HPLC. Antifungal activity of purified products was confirmed by deferred overlay inhibition assay. Mass spectrometry (MS) was performed to determine the molecular weight of the isolated compounds. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted to predict secondary metabolite gene clusters encoded by the two antifungal-producing strains. Using MS and WGS data, we determined that the main antifungal compound produced by these two Bacillus velezensis isolates was iturin A, a lipopeptide exhibiting broad spectrum antifungal activity."
https://openalex.org/W4224302436,"Of the 1010 reported maternal deaths in 2018, just over 65% occurred in hospitals in Ethiopia. However, there is a lack of standardised data about the contributing factors. This study aimed to investigate the incidence, mortality, and factors associated with primary postpartum haemorrhage following in-hospital births in northwest Ethiopia.A retrospective cohort design was used; an audit of 1060 maternity care logbooks of adult women post-partum at Felege Hiwot Referral Hospital and University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. The data were abstracted between December 2018 and May 2019 using a systematic random sampling technique. We used the Facility Based Maternal Death Abstraction Form containing sociodemographic characteristics, women's medical history, and partographs. Primary postpartum haemorrhage was defined as the estimated blood loss recorded by the staff greater or equal to 500 ml for vaginal births and 1000 ml for caesarean section births, or the medical doctor diagnosis and recording of the woman as having primary postpartum haemorrhage. The data analysis was undertaken using Stata version 15. Variables with P ≤ 0.10 for significance were selected to run multivariable logistic analyses. Variables that had associations with primary postpartum haemorrhage were identified based on the odds ratio, with 95% confidence interval (CI) and P-value less than 0.05.The incidence of primary postpartum haemorrhage in the hospitals was 8.8% (95% CI: 7.2, 10.6). Of these, there were 7.4% (95% CI: 2.1, 13.3) maternal deaths. Eight predictor variables were found to be independently associated with primary postpartum haemorrhage, including age ≥35 years (AOR: 2.20; 95% CI: 1.08, 4.46; P = 0.03), longer than 24 hours duration of labour (AOR: 7.18; 95% CI: 2.73, 18.90; P = 0.01), vaginal or cervical lacerations (AOR: 4.95; 95% CI: 2.49, 9.86; P = 0.01), instrumental (forceps or vacuum)-assisted birth (AOR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.25, 6.81; P = 0.01), retained placenta (AOR: 21.83; 95% CI: 6.33, 75.20; P = 0.01), antepartum haemorrhage in recent pregnancy (AOR: 6.90; 95% CI: 3.43, 13. 84; p = 0.01), women in labour referred from primary health centres (AOR: 2.48; 95% CI: 1.39, 4.42; P = 0.02), and births managed by medical interns (AOR: 2.90; 95% CI: 1.55, 5.37; P = 0.01).We found that while the incidence of primary postpartum haemorrhage appeared to be lower than in other studies in Africa the associated maternal mortality was higher. Although most factors associated with primary postpartum haemorrhage were consistent with those identified in the literature, two additional specific factors, were found to be prevalent among women in Ethiopia; the factors were referred women in labour from primary health facilities and births managed by medical interns.

The goal of this research was to create an improved metric method using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to determine sex from both whole and modeled fragmented human pubic bones. The sample consisted of n = 378 pubic bones from the University of New Mexico’s Maxwell Museum Documented Skeletal Collection and eight landmarks were collected from each bone. Statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms were used to predict the accuracy of the method’s ability to classify a bone as male or female on both whole and simulated fragmented remains; this included tests run on each possible landmark combination of three or more landmarks to simulate fragmented bones (218 combinations). The results of the whole bone analysis resulted in 95.35% testing accuracy. The results of the modeled fragmentary analysis consisted of 164 combinations which exhibit a 90% or higher accuracy in sex prediction; and twelve combinations which exhibit 96% or higher accuracy in sex prediction. In particular, two landmarks clustered around the ventral arc of the pubic bone performed the best, indicating this is the most sexually dimorphic portion of the bone. These results indicate that three-dimensional geometric morphometrics is a valid method to be applied to sex determination in forensic anthropology."
https://openalex.org/W4226287478,"The Covid-19 global pandemic that began in March 2020 was not fully mitigated through governmental Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) and continued to infect people and take lives through 2021. Since many countries were affected by the second, third, and fourth waves of Covid-19, governments extended and strengthened NPIs, but these actions led to citizen protests and fatigue. In this study, we investigate the effect of a lockdown policy on Covid-19 third wave implemented by the province of Ontario, Canada, on April 3 rd 2021, followed by a stay-at-home order on April 7 th 2021 while free Covid-19 testing and vaccination were in progress. Herein, the effect of both NPIs and vaccination are considered simultaneously. We used the prevalence of Covid-19 cases, tests, and administered vaccines data reported publicly by the Government of Ontario on their website. Because mobility changes can reflect the behaviors and adherence of residents with a stay-at-home order, Covid-19 community mobility data for Ontario provided by Google was also considered. A statistical method called interrupted time series was used to analyze the data. The results indicated that, although vaccinations helped to control the Covid-19 infection rate during this time, the stay-at-home order caused a rate reduction by decreasing the trend of the Covid-19 prevalence by 13 (±0.8962) persons per million daily and the level by 33 (±7.6854) persons per million. Furthermore, the stay-at-home order resulted in approximately a 37% reduction in Covid-19 prevalence one week after the intervention’s effective date. Therefore, Ontario’s strict lockdown policy, including several NPIs, mitigated the Covid-19 surge during the third wave. The results show that even when vaccination is in progress, strict NPIs such as lockdown is required to control Covid-19 waves, and early re-openings should be avoided. These results may also be useful for other countries that have implemented delayed vaccination schedules."

The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of SOGIE conversion efforts, including their sociodemographic correlates, among LGBTQI2+ persons.Using community-based sampling, we assessed SOGIE conversion attempts and involvement in conversion services of 3,261 LGBTQI2+ persons aged 18 years and older in Quebec, Canada.A quarter of respondents experienced SOGIE conversion attempts, and fewer than 5% were involved in conversion services. Over half of those who were involved in SOGIE conversion services consented to them, but the services' goals were made clear and explicit to only 55% and 30% of those who engaged in SO and GIE conversion, respectively. The results also suggest that family plays a key role in SOGIE conversion attempts and services utilization, and that indigenous, intersex, transgender, non-binary, and asexual persons, people of colour, as well as individuals whose sexual orientation is not monosexual (i.e., bisexual, pansexual) were more likely to have been exposed to conversion attempts and involved in conversion services.This study found that the prevalence of conversion efforts is substantial. Interventions to protect LGBTQI2+ people from such attempts should focus not only on legal bans, but also on supporting families who need to be counseled in accepting sexual and gender diversity. Health professionals need to be adequately trained in LGBTQI2+ affirmative approaches. Religious therapists should consult with colleagues and undergo supervision to ensure that their religious beliefs do not interfere with their practice."
https://openalex.org/W4226373888,"Estimating the clinical demand for blood and components arising in a health facility is crucial to ensure timely availability of blood. This study aims to estimate disease-specific clinical demand, supply and utilization of whole blood and components in India.We conducted a national level cross-sectional study in five randomly selected states from five regions of the country. We included 251 public and private facilities representing primary, secondary and tertiary care facilities. We collected annual disease-specific demand, supply and utilization of blood and components using a structured tool. We estimated the national demand by extrapolating the study data (demand and beds) to the total number of estimated beds in the country.According to the study, the total clinical demand of 251 health facilities with 51,562 beds was 474,627 whole blood units. Based on this, the clinical demand for India was estimated at 14·6 million whole blood units (95 CI: 14·59-14·62), an equivalent of 36·3 donations per 1,000 eligible populations, which will address whole blood and component requirement. The medicine specialty accounted for 6·0 million units (41·2%), followed by surgery 4·1 million (27·9%), obstetrics and gynecology 3·3 million (22·4%) and pediatrics 1·2 million (8·5%) units. The supply was 93% which is equivalent to 33·8 donations against the demand.The study indicated a demand and supply gap of 2.5 donations per 1,000 eligible persons which is around one million units. The gap emphasises the need for sustained and concerted efforts from all stakeholders and for increasing the awareness about repeat voluntary non-remunerated blood donation (VNRBD); optimizing the availability of blood components through efficient blood component separation units; promoting modern principles of patient blood management and strengthening capacities of human resources in the blood transfusion system in India."

He has highlighted the role of BCL11A in the fetal-adult hemoglobin switch. The Gairdner Foundation Award recognizes Orkin’s contribution to the development of gene therapy of sickle cell disease. Through studies in mice and in humans, Stuart Orkin showed that GATA-1 is a master transcriptional regulator of hematopoiesis. He has highlighted the role of BCL11A in the fetal-adult hemoglobin switch. The Gairdner Foundation Award recognizes Orkin’s contribution to the development of gene therapy of sickle cell disease. Pioneers and historians of molecular biology have perceived two strands at the origin of this science: understanding structures, mainly of nucleic acids and proteins, and understanding how genetic information is transmitted and expressed (Stent, 1968Stent G.S. That was the molecular biology that was.Science. 1968; 160: 390-395Google Scholar). Initially the preferred organisms were bacteria and bacteriophages, but F.H.C. Crick remarked that sometimes the choice was “oddly enough, man himself, though mainly because of a single one of his molecules – hemoglobin.” Indeed hemoglobin was the first oligomeric protein the structure of which was solved at high resolution by Max Perutz, over 2 decades of work. mRNA was difficult to investigate in bacteria on account of its heterogeneity, whereas in mammalian reticulocytes, over 90% of mRNA could be expected to encode globin chains. In a series of papers that helped to make this very journal rapidly prominent, the group of Tom Maniatis and others made use of this unique advantage in order to sequence the mRNA itself and then clone and sequence the globin genes. Soon after introns were discovered, it was from the globin genes that we learnt, through work in Phil Leder’s lab, that this was a general feature in the mammalian genome. Equally important for us physicians, hemoglobin is at the center of genetic diseases: sickle cell disease (SCD), a major public health problem especially in Africa (Makani et al., 2018Makani J. Tluway F. Makubi A. Soka D. Nkya S. Sangeda R. Mgaya J. Rwezaula S. Kirkham F.J. Kindole C. et al.A ten year review of the sickle cell program in Muhimbili National Hospital, Tanzania.BMC Hematol. 2018; 18: 33Google Scholar), and the thalassaemias, a group of genetic diseases that are a problem in many countries, the molecular genetics of which was spearheaded by David Weatherall and many others. It is the contribution of Stuart Orkin to understanding in depth these problems that the Canada Gairdner Awards has recognized In 1972, a short paper in Nature, published by the distinguished Hungarian hematologist Susan Hollàn, had more than tickled the hemoglobin field. That paper reported the discovery of three hemoglobins co-existing in the same person: normal hemoglobin (Hb A), and two abnormal hemoglobins. The entirely novel intriguing finding was that each of the two abnormal hemoglobins, called J-Buda and G-Pest, had different amino acid replacements, both in the α chain, implying that there must have been at least three α-globin genes in that person. In fact, that the α-globin locus might be duplicated in humans had been suggested already by Hermann Lehmann and Robin Carrell in 1968, and this notion was supported by a painstaking genetic analysis of families in Thailand with different forms of α-thalassemia (see ;Wasi et al., 1972Wasi P. Na-Nakorn S. Pootrakul P. Panich V. Incidence of haemoglobin Thai: a re-examination of the genetics of alpha-thalassaemic diseases.Ann. Hum. Genet. 1972; 35: 467-470Google Scholar). However, the notion only became a proven fact when Orkin was able to construct a detailed restriction map (Orkin, 1978Orkin S.H. The duplicated human alpha globin genes lie close together in cellular DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 1978; 75: 5950-5954Google Scholar) of the α-globin gene region, now known to be on chromosome 16p13.3 (Figure 1B ). This was one of the first examples where the physical location of two neighboring genes was established within the human genome. For the older one of us (L.L.), memories go back to the 19th Congress of the International Society of Hematology held in 1982 in Budapest. Susan Hollàn, the president of that congress, confided to L.L. that she had succeeded in advocating for the young Stuart Orkin, rather than a more senior person, to give a keynote lecture. Stuart Orkin had trained as MD at Harvard Medical School and had worked in Phil Leder’s lab at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He was then recruited by David Nathan to the Faculty at Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, where he took on the challenge of studying the physiology and pathology of hemoglobins and erythropoiesis. Stuart’s lecture was a success, and he was quick to realize that his findings had important medical implications. Until then, prenatal diagnosis of thalassemia was carried out by sampling of fetal blood from the placenta at 18–20 weeks pregnancy: this technique was invasive and not free of risks. When Y.W. Kan and An M. Dozy discovered that a single base change, now called a single nucleotide polymorphism or SNP, was in strong linkage disequilibrium with the βS mutation they set the ground, long before the human genome project was even started, for what became known as genome wide association studies (GWASs). As a result, prenatal diagnosis of SCD could be done at the DNA level, without the need for fetal blood sampling, Following Orkin’s work, this was now possible also for severe forms of α-thalassaemia. This meant that prenatal diagnosis was now feasible at 10–12 weeks by the less invasive technique of sampling chorionic villi. Programs based on this approach have eventually reduced by more than 80% the births of babies with severe β-thalassemia in Sardinia, thanks to the single-minded efforts of Antonio Cao, and in Cyprus. Orkin’s major contributions to understanding the molecular and genetic basis of hematopoiesis were just getting started. Some of his most seminal contributions were in understanding the genetic basis of erythrocyte differentiation. Erythropoiesis is an extreme example of how a program of cell differentiation is implemented. From a stem cell that is anything but red, the program produces erythrocytes that contain 34% hemoglobin; no other cell in the body has a comparable concentration of a single protein. The differentiation process involves selective expression of heme and globin genes: this is gradual at first, but then the expression of the latter becomes explosive and almost exclusive. In the course of the process, major cellular events take place: the nucleus becomes pycnotic and is eventually extruded, the cytoskeleton is re-arranged, mitochondria are lost, and in the end, even ribosomes are lost. Despite these major losses, the mature red blood cells are endowed with extraordinary pliability and will circulate in the blood for 120 days. This is why we, haematologists, tell students that the erythrocyte is the most altruistic among cells: it has sacrificed aerobic metabolism, it has sacrificed the ability to make protein, and it has even given up reproduction for the sake of the single purpose to convey the maximum amount of oxygen to all other cells in the body. The differentiation program must involve cell-intrinsic regulatory elements in the genome; growth factors such as erythropoietin, discovered by Eugene Golwasser and studied in depth by Harvey Lodish and others; and physical signals from the environmental niche. An important discovery by Orkin was to identify GATA-1, a zinc-finger protein (independently isolated by Gary Felsenfeld) as a transcriptional regulator of blood cell development that cooperates with another zinc finger protein that they called Friend of GATA-1 (FOG) (Whitelaw et al., 1990Whitelaw E. Tsai S.F. Hogben P. Orkin S.H. Regulated expression of globin chains and the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 during erythropoiesis in the developing mouse.Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 6596-6606Google Scholar). This work was the basis for the subsequent understanding of the role of other transcription factors and of epigenetic events involved in both determination of the erythroid lineage from multi-potent progenitors and cell maturation within the erythroid lineage itself. GATA-1 can be regarded as a “master gene” within hematopoiesis (Figure 2), and its study has unveiled the close relationship between the erythroid and the megakaryocytic lineage. Most of this work was carried out in mice, thanks to increasingly sophisticated technologies, based on targeted homologous recombination pioneered by Mario Capecchi, for generating gene knockouts. Thus, it had become possible not only to model human diseases in the mouse but also to invent new combinations of genetic abnormalities. Added interest by hematologists in GATA-1 arose when it was discovered by Michelle Le Beau, John Crispino, and collaborators that truncating somatic mutations of GATA-1 were responsible, in infants with trisomy 21, for the transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) that may evolve to acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Stuart Orkin, again by using mouse models, then found that truncated GATA-1 leads to hyper-proliferation of yolk sac and fetal liver progenitor cells, which may account for the usually transient nature of TMD. In the meantime, Orkin was also involved in pinpointing pathology arising from germline GATA-1 mutations, including thalassemia and X-linked thrombocytopenia, dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Interestingly, GATA-1 maps to the X chromosome just like ATRX, the α-globin gene regulator and chromatin remodeller discovered by David Weatherall, Richard Gibbons, and Doug Higgs. This is important from the clinical point of view, because one mutant X-linked gene is enough to give disease in male hemizygotes. For many years, one of the most intriguing features of the developmental biology of human hematopoiesis has been the transition, around birth, from producing fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) to producing adult hemoglobin (Hb A), known as “the Hb switch.” It has been clear for over half a century that, around birth, the fetal genes HBG1 (formerly Gγ) and HBG2 (formerly Aγ) are turned off at the transcriptional level, whereas HBB (β) and HBD (δ) are turned on. However, the precise mechanism has remained elusive, until GWASs carried out by Swee-Lay Thein and others revealed that at least three loci significantly influence the residual Hb F synthesis that takes place in adults. One of these, BCL11A, became a main focus of investigation by Stuart Orkin and his colleague Vijay Sankaran: their work identified an erythroid-specific enhancer within this gene, and they found that BCL11A expression and enhancer activity were influenced by GATA-1. They then showed that the BCL11A protein targets specific sites in the γ-globin gene promoters and thus is key to the Hb switch (Liu et al., 2021Liu N. Xu S. Yao Q. Zhu Q. Kai Y. Hsu J.Y. Sakon P. Pinello L. Yuan G.C. Bauer D.E. et al.Transcription factor competition at the gamma-globin promoters controls hemoglobin switching.Nat. Genet. 2021; 53: 511-520Google Scholar). It was this work that inspired the younger of us (J.M.) to analyze the variability of Hb F levels and of F cells in a selected population of patients with SCD in Tanzania. The pathophysiology of β-thalassemias and of SCD is fundamentally different, as the defect is quantitative in the former and qualitative in the latter; however, they are allelic; i.e., they result from mutations at the same locus. Genetic correction of somatic cells aiming to cure human disease has been a coveted objective since the dawn of molecular genetics. Given the hemoglobin genes were the first to be identified and available, hemoglobinopathies were from the outset an obvious target for genetic correction. For some time, retroviral vectors seemed the best candidates to transfer the β-globin gene into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), but David Williams and Stuart Orkin, among others, were well aware that, in the case of hemoglobinopathies, a major hurdle would be the very high level of expression needed. Indeed, this is a main reason why gene therapy has been successful in some other genetic diseases before hemogobinopathies. In that respect, a major advance came from Frank Grosveld’s group, when they discovered a set of DNase hypersensitive sites upstream of the β-globin gene cluster that act as a crucial enhancer and that they named the locus control region (LCR). When introduced in the mouse genome, along with the human β-globin gene, the LCR caused the latter to be expressed at the same level as the endogenous mouse β-globin gene (Talbot et al., 1989Talbot D. Collis P. Antoniou M. Vidal M. Grosveld F. Greaves D.R. A dominant control region from the human beta-globin locus conferring integration site-independent gene expression.Nature. 1989; 338: 352-355Google Scholar). It became clear that the LCR, or at least some of it, was absolutely required for high expression. By that time, a lentivirus was preferred over a retrovirus, because it could transduce into quiescent stem cells: after testing dozens of constructs, and after fine-tuning regulator and insulator elements without compromising viral titre, Michel Sadelain came up with a suitable vector and succeeded in curing thalassemic mice (May et al., 2000May C. Rivella S. Callegari J. Heller G. Gaensler K.M. Luzzatto L. Sadelain M. Therapeutic haemoglobin synthesis in beta-thalassaemic mice expressing lentivirus-encoded human beta-globin.Nature. 2000; 406: 82-86Google Scholar). Subsequently, in Marina Cavazzana-Calvo’s unit, this approach succeeded in human patients, both in thalassaemia and in SCD (Ribeil et al., 2017Ribeil J.A. Hacein-Bey-Abina S. Payen E. Magnani A. Semeraro M. Magrin E. Caccavelli L. Neven B. Bourget P. El Nemer W. et al.Gene therapy in a patient with sickle cell disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2017; 376: 848-855Google Scholar). SCD is formally listed as a rare disease in many countries, yet it is anything but rare in Africa. In some African countries, up to 2% of infants may be born with this condition, and the heterozygote frequency may reach 25%. SCD is recognized by the WHO as a major public health problem. There are disease-modifying treatments including hydroxyurea, which has been abundantly time tested and is low cost. There are also curative treatments: hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and now gene therapy through the advances described here, both with a high cost. This creates a difficult situation: should curative treatments be made available in Africa (HSCT has been done in Nigeria), when most patients are still not receiving even hydroxyurea? Medicine has evolved in every human culture: it is a distinctive feature of the human species that through medicine we have chosen to oppose Darwinian selection. Therefore, we feel strongly that any kind of medicine/intervention should be without barriers; at the same time, we must be realistic. Developing facilities for curative therapies in Africa is important, and we should not relent on these necessary efforts. In the meantime, to provide hydroxyurea to all patients with SCD in Africa is a must; how this might be achieved and some of the hurdles we have discussed elsewhere (Luzzatto and Makani, 2021Luzzatto L. Makani J. Treating rare diseases in Africa: the Drugs exist but the need is Unmet.Front Pharmacol. 2021; 12: 770640Google Scholar). There is hope that the predicament outlined in the previous paragraph might benefit from progress that again owes to the perseverance of Stuart Orkin (Orkin, 2021Orkin S.H. Molecular medicine: found in translation.Med (N Y). 2021; 2: 122-136Google Scholar) and of many others, who have contributed to the biennial hemoglobin switching conference, established by George Stamatoyannopoulos in 1978, with the expressed aim of curing thalassemia and SCD by reactivating fetal hemoglobin synthesis. It has been known for a long time that the biallelic combination of the Hb S (HBBE6V) gene with a gene responsible for the syndrome of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) is clinically benign, because Hb F interferes potently with the polymerization of deoxy-hemoglobin S that causes sickling. Based on the role of BCL11A discussed above, one might expect that silencing BCL11A in a patient with SCD will increase Hb F and conversely decrease Hb S. Indeed, by using a short RNA homologous to the BCL11A transcript the translation of this gene is inhibited; this has produced a marked increase in Hb F in patients with SCD (Esrick et al., 2021Esrick E.B. Lehmann L.E. Biffi A. Achebe M. Brendel C. Ciuculescu M.F. Daley H. MacKinnon B. Morris E. Federico A. et al.Post-transcriptional genetic silencing of BCL11A to Treat sickle cell disease.N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 384: 205-215Google Scholar): in this way, SCD is converted to the phenotype of Hb S/HPFH. A similar result has been obtained by CRISPR-Cas-mediated editing of a short sequence within the erythroid-specific enhancer of the BCL11A gene itself (Frangoul et al., 2021Frangoul H. Altshuler D. Cappellini M.D. Chen Y.S. Domm J. Eustace B.K. Foell J. de la Fuente J. Grupp S. Handgretinger R. et al.CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 384: 252-260Google Scholar). In general, inhibiting or disrupting a gene can be regarded as easier than replacing a gene—there may be several ways to target BCL11A, whether permanently or transiently, and this opens up therapeutic prospects. In his spirited article that narrated the romantic phase and the dogmatic phase of molecular biology, Gunther Stent (Stent, 1968Stent G.S. That was the molecular biology that was.Science. 1968; 160: 390-395Google Scholar) seemed to lament that the golden era might be finished. Well, if the legacy is gene therapy, we are not complaining. At the same time, the genetic strand and the structural strand at the origin of molecular biology have become vigorously intertwined. The linear (one-dimensional) information in the DNA sequence encodes a developmental program that cannot be understood without taking into account the three-dimensional arrangement of DNA in chromatin, and millions of DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Some of the more recent work by Stuart Orkin and colleagues bears witness to this: they have used single-cell genome editing assay in conjunction with quantitative modeling and chromatin capture analyses in order to foster a comprehensive understanding of how distinct regulatory mechanisms can synergistically modulate Hb F expression (Shen et al., 2021Shen Y. Verboon J.M. Zhang Y. Liu N. Kim Y.J. Marglous S. Nandakumar S.K. Voit R.A. Fiorini C. Ejaz A. et al.A unified model of human hemoglobin switching through single-cell genome editing.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 4991Google Scholar). These studies have confirmed and refined (Figure 3) Grosveld’s model, whereby through DNA looping, the LCR comes in contact in turn with the fetal globin gene promoters and then with the adult globin gene promoters. It remains to be uncovered, perhaps in the next switching conference, what triggers this remarkably timely physiological developmental phenomenon: whether it is a count of cell divisions from the onset of embryogenesis or subtle specific cues from a physical change in the environmental related to bone marrow organogenesis. It is a natural question to ask, in biology and medicine, to what extent what we learn in a particular system has more general validity. The DNA region embedding the α-globin gene cluster is different in several respects from the region embedding the β-globin gene cluster, and the α-thalassaemias are clinically different from the β-thalassaemia, and they present much earlier (before birth) because there is no fetal-to-adult switch. However, there is a much earlier switch, from ζ to α. Doug Higgs’s group has shown recently that in embryonic erythroid cells, the ζ-gene lies within open, acetylated chromatin, where it is able to interact with the α-globin super-enhancer; whereas in adult erythroid cells it is packaged within hypo-acetylated, facultative heterochromatin, where it no longer interacts with its enhancers. The ζ-gene can be partially re-activated by inhibition of histone de-acetylases, suggesting possible therapies for severe α-thalassemia (King et al., 2021King A.J. Songdej D. Downes D.J. Beagrie R.A. Liu S. Buckley M. Hua P. Suciu M.C. Marieke Oudelaar A. Hanssen L.L.P. et al.Reactivation of a developmentally silenced embryonic globin gene.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 4439Google Scholar). It is clear that Stuart Orkin’s contributions, spanning 5 decades, have been prompted by scientific curiosity, by the challenge of tackling difficult problems, and by his judgment of what questions are important. Like in many other cases, discoveries in basic biology have led, many years later, to advances in the management of a serious disease; in this case, the extraordinary accomplishment of a gene therapy for SCD. As this is still a demanding procedure, all of us would prefer that, instead of requiring high-tech ex vivo manipulation of a cell suspension enriched in the patient’s HSC, it could be done by a simple injection of nanoparticles encapsulating a gene-editing device. Such in vivo gene therapy has been already successful in hemophilia with the AAV vectors targeting hepatocytes. It appears at the moment more difficult to target HSCs, but there is no a priori reason to regard it as impossible. Such an approach would greatly help with the difficult ethical dilemma that must be addressed in order to obtain that not only ameliorating therapy but also curative therapy for SCD, using gene therapy, is accessible and affordable in Africa. There has been no financial support for this article. We declare an interest in providing a cure for sickle cell disease to patients in Africa. We are grateful to all those—including Stuart Orkin—from whom, through reading and listening, we have learnt about hemoglobin, hemoglobinopathies, and the switch. We are equally grateful to all patients from whom we have learnt about sickle cell disease in real life. The authors declare no competing interests."
https://openalex.org/W4225435549,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a hereditary disease affecting tens of thousands of people world-wide. Here we analyzed the effect of an amino acid substitution in the RNA helicase DHX38 (Prp16) causing RP. DHX38 has been proposed as the helicase important for the 2nd step of splicing. We showed that DHX38 associates with key splicing factors involved in both splicing steps but did not find any evidence that the RP mutations changes DHX38 interaction profile with the spliceosome. We further downregulated DHX38 and monitored changes in splicing. We observed only minor perturbations of general splicing but detected modulation of ~70 alternative splicing events. Next, we probed DHX38 function in splicing of retina specific genes and found that FSCN2 splicing is dependent on DHX38. In addition, RHO splicing was inhibited specifically by expression of DHX38 RP variant. Finally, we showed that overexpression of DHX38 promotes usage of canonical as well as cryptic 5' splice sites in HBB splicing reporter. Together, our data show that DHX38 is a splicing factor that promotes splicing of cryptic splice sites and regulate alternative splicing. We further provide evidence that the RP-linked substitution G332D modulates DHX38 splicing activity."
https://openalex.org/W4225515066,"Early initiation of antenatal care (ANC) provided by skilled personnel is essential as it enables pregnant women to receive comprehensive reproductive health services. Early ANC utilisation could prevent complications related to pregnancy and improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes. Regardless of this, only forty-one in every hundred women in Cameroon seek early ANC services. Studies on the uptake of antenatal care in Cameroon have not focused on individual and community-level factors that influence early initiation of ANC. This study aimed at investigating the association between individual and community-level factors and early ANC uptake in Cameroon.This study was a cross-sectional survey design. Data was extracted from the women's file of the 2018 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS). A sample of 4,183 women aged 15-49 who had complete information on variables of interest to the study was used. The outcome variable was early ANC (i.e. women whose first ANC occurred between 0-3 months of pregnancy). Eighteen explanatory variables consisting of fifteen individual-level variables and three community-level variables were selected for the study. At 95% confidence interval (95% CI), two-level multilevel models were built. The results for the fixed effects were presented in adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and the random effects were expressed in terms of Intra-Class Correlation (ICC) and Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) variance.Descriptively, 46% [CI = 45.0-48.0] of the women aged 15-49 attended ANC earlier. The median age at which women started utilising early ANC was 28 (15 to 48) years. For the fixed effects results, it was found that the odds of seeking early ANC increased among those aged 35-39 [aOR = 1.78, CI = 1.24-2.57], the richest [aOR = 2.43, CI = 1.63-3.64] and those with secondary/higher education [aOR = 1.38, CI = 1.05-1.82]. Muslims [aOR = 0.73, CI = 0.60-0.88] and women at parity four or more had lesser odds to seek early ANC [aOR = 0.63, CI = 0.49-0.82]. The study found that primary sampling unit (community/cluster) [σ2 = 0.53, CI = 0.40-0.72] and individual [σ2 = 0.16, CI = 0.09-0.29] level variations exist in early initiation of ANC. About 14% (intra-class correlation (ICC) = 0.14) and 5% (ICC = 0.05) variability in early initiation of ANC were attributable to variations in the primary sampling unit (community/cluster) and individual-level factors, respectively.Individual-level factors (maternal age, wealth status, educational attainment and religious affiliation) were associated with early initiation of ANC whereas variations in cluster/community characteristics contributed to the variations in early initiation of ANC seeking. The Departments of Health Promotion, Health Information Center and eHealth under the Ministry of Public Health, Cameroon, have to strengthen mass sensitisation programs on early ANC uptake and such programs should consider individual differences such as age, wealth status, education, and religious affiliation in its program design."
https://openalex.org/W4225805656,"This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of maternal and child health handbook (MCH) enhanced by mobile tools and to generate evidence informing the adoption of the program in Bangladesh. A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) has been implemented in Lohagora of Narail District and Dhamrai of Dhaka District. Unions of the study settings were randomly allocated in either one of three groups: (1) Intervention 1 using both mobile platform and MCH, (2) Intervention 2 using MCH alone, or (3) the Control. A total of 3,002 participants were recruited. The interventions were designed to promote two-way communications between pregnant women/their families and community health workers by an empowering approach. A total of 3,002 pregnant women were recruited. As the results, the interventions both significantly improved the utilization of CoC, although the overall proportion of CoC was relevantly low: 2.79% in the Control (95% CI: 1.37-3.54%), 6.16% in Intervention 2 (95% CI: 4.67-7.86%), and 7.89% in Intervention 1 (95% CI: 6.29-9.90%). Neonatal mortality rate with and without CoC was 5.43 per 1,000 (95% CI: 3.63-9.57 per 1,000) and 34.8 per 1,000 (95% CI: 24.3-45.4 per 1,000), respectively. Our study indicated the effectiveness of the interventions by leveraging MCH and a mobile platform to promote uptake of CoC throughout prepartum, intrapartum and postpartum/neonatal periods, potentially bringing long-lasting benefits to mothers and their offspring. The explicit approach is expected to guide policy makers to adopt MCH interventions in primary healthcare strengthening at the community level.

https://openalex.org/W4226111075,"Background The U.S. military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan had the most casualties since Vietnam with more than 53,000 wounded in action. Novel injury mechanisms, such as improvised explosive devices, and higher rates of survivability compared with previous wars led to a new pattern of combat injuries. The purpose of the present study was to use latent class analysis (LCA) to identify combat injury profiles among U.S. military personnel who survived serious wounds. Methods A total of 5,227 combat casualty events with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 9 or greater that occurred in Iraq and Afghanistan from December 2002 to July 2019 were identified from the Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database for analysis. The Barell Injury Diagnosis Matrix was used to classify injuries into binary variables by site and type of injury. LCA was employed to identify injury profiles that accounted for co-occurring injuries. Injury profiles were described and compared by demographic, operational, and injury-specific variables. Results Seven injury profiles were identified and defined as: (1) open wounds (18.8%), (2) Type 1 traumatic brain injury (TBI)/facial injuries (14.2%), (3) disseminated injuries (6.8%), (4) Type 2 TBI (15.4%), (5) lower extremity injuries (19.8%), (6) burns (7.4%), and (7) chest and/or abdominal injuries (17.7%). Profiles differed by service branch, combat location, year of injury, injury mechanism, combat posture at the time of injury, and ISS. Conclusion LCA identified seven distinct and interpretable injury profiles among U.S. military personnel who survived serious combat injuries in Iraq or Afghanistan. These findings may be of interest to military medical planners as resource needs are evaluated and projected for future conflicts, and medical professionals involved in the rehabilitation of wounded service members."
https://openalex.org/W4226138243,"Introduction University students’ psychological health is linked to their academic satisfaction. This study aimed to investigate students’ psychological health and academic satisfaction in the context of COVID-19 and academic year-end stress. Materials and methods Standardized self-filled scales for anxiety, depression, stress, psychological well-being, academic satisfaction (subjective assessment of students’ quality of life in their educational setting), and an ad-hoc scale for stress on the learning experience due to COVID-19 were used in this cross-sectional study. Participants were first- to third-year students of eight different health-related tracks in Geneva, Switzerland. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression analyses were applied. Results In June 2020, out of 2835 invited students, 433 (15%) completed the survey. Academic satisfaction was a stronger mental health predictor than COVID-19 stress on the learning experience, which mainly predicted stress and anxiety. Lower academic satisfaction scores were significantly associated with stress (β = −0.53, p &lt; 0.001), depression (β = −0.26, p &lt; 0.001), anxiety (β = −0.20, p &lt; 0.001), while higher scores with psychological well-being (β = 0.48, p &lt; 0.001). Identifying as female was strongly associated with anxiety and stress but not with depression or psychological well-being. Lower age was associated with stress only. The nature of the academic training had a lesser impact on mental health and the academic year had no impact. Conclusions Academic satisfaction plays a more substantial role than COVID-19 stress on the learning experience in predicting students’ overall mental health status. Training institutions should address the underlying factors that can enhance students’ academic satisfaction, especially during the COVID-19 period, in addition to ensuring that they have a continuous and adequate learning experience, as well as access to psychosocial services that help them cope with mental distress and enhance their psychological well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4226185775,"Oxidative stress has a major role in disease pathogenesis. However, limited studies have investigated the effect of various sample collection tubes on oxidative biomarkers. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of different collection tubes on the variation of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), total thiol (t-SH), and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) levels. A total of 35 individuals participated in this study and each collected sample was separated into three different tubes: glass tubes (GTs), plain plastic tubes (PTs), and gel separator tubes (GSTs). The results of PTs and GSTs were compared to those of GTs as the reference tube. The comparison between the means of biomarkers in various tubes indicated that there was no significant difference in MDA results between tubes. In contrast, t-SH and NO content were significantly decreased in GSTs and PTs compared to GTs. However, the Bland-Altman analysis showed an acceptable concordance for the mentioned analytes and the statistically significant differences were not clinically significant for NO, MDA, and t-SH antioxidant parameters. Moreover, the FRAP level was considerably lower in GSTs compared to GTs. Nevertheless, the Bland-Altman analysis showed a high bias percentage for the FRAP assay when using PTs and GSTs. According to the present results, it can be concluded that switching to plastic blood collection tubes or serum separation tubes could influence the FRAP results. However, there was no interference for the interpretation of other antioxidant assays in different types of collection tubes. Hence, it is suggested to use GTs for total antioxidant capacity evaluations, especially the FRAP assay."
https://openalex.org/W4226303985,"Under-five mortality (U5M) is one of the most important and sensitive indicators of the health status of the community. Despite there having been a substantial reduction in U5M since 1990, its rate is still high in Sub-Saharan African countries. Thus, this study aimed to assess time to under-five mortality and its predictors in rural Ethiopia.This study utilized a secondary analysis of the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). A total of 9,807 weighted under-five children selected at different stages were included in the analysis. The Kaplan-Meier and Cox's-gamma shared frailty models were used to estimate survival time and to identify predictors of under-five mortality, respectively. An adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) along with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) was used to measure the effect size and direction of the association.The study indicated that 6.69% (95% CI: 6.13, 7.30) of children died before celebrating their fifth birthday in rural Ethiopia. Of all the deaths, the median time to death was 27 months. After controlling the effect of cluster and other confounding factors, female sex (AHR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.75), ever born greater than five children (AHR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.83), very large size at birth (AHR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.03 1.71), very small size at birth (AHR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.82), twin pregnancy (AHR = 3.5, 95% CI: 2.47, 4.88), not ever breastfeeding (AHR = 11.29, 95% CI: 9.03, 14.12), unimproved latrine (AHR = 3.44, 95% CI: 1.91, 6.17), covered by health insurance (AHR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.70) were predictors of under-five mortality.Still under-five mortality was high in rural Ethiopia as compared to the global under-five mortality rate. In the final model, sex of a child, the total number of children ever born, children's size at birth, type of pregnancy, breastfeeding, type of toilet, and being covered by health insurance were significant predictors of under-five mortality. Further emphasis should be given to twin and not breastfeeding children, as well as households' better encouraging membership of community health insurance and utilization of improved latrines."
https://openalex.org/W4225640600,"Chikungunya virus is an arthropod-transmitted virus that causes chikungunya fever, a disease characterized by severe muscle and joint pain. In 2013, the virus was introduced to the Americas and caused approximately 2.7 million cases of infection during the subsequent two years. The lack of knowledge regarding the biological behavior of the viral strains circulating during the outbreak motivated the characterization of an isolate from the Colombian outbreak, starting from analysis of the complete genome to the biological behavior in vitro. The full genome was retrieved using next-generation sequencing. The infective and replicative capacities were evaluated in HEK293T, Huh-7, and MRC-5 cell lines. The infection rates were determined by flow cytometry, and the cytopathic effect was assessed by a resazurin fluorescent metabolic assay. The viral yield was quantified using the virus plaque formation assay, while the viral proteins and genomic RNA kinetics were subsequently evaluated by western-blot and RT-qPCR. The COL7624 isolate clustered with other American and Caribbean sequences in the Asian American lineage. The T669A substitution in E2 protein distinguished it from other Colombian sequences reported in 2014. After 48 h post infection (hpi), the three cell lines analyzed reached infection percentages exceeding 65%, generating a high load of infectious viral progeny. The infection kinetics indicated that the replication peak of this CHIKV isolate is around 24 hpi, although gRNA is detectable in the culture supernatant from 4 hpi onwards. The infection caused the overexpression of interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-8. The COL7624 CHIKV isolate exhibited a high infective and replicative capacity as well as activation of cellular immune responses, similar to isolates belonging to the other genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W4225713187,"Objective This study aimed to compare the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness and macular thickness (MT) between patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (NDCKD) and controls, as well as between different stages of NDCKD. We also evaluated the correlation between pRNFL thickness and MT with duration of NDCKD. Methods This was a comparative cross-sectional study. Subjects were divided into NDCKD and control groups. Both pRNFL thickness and MT, including center subfield thickness (CST), average MT as well as average ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) were measured using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. One-way ANCOVA test was used to compare the differences in pRNFL and MT between NDCKD and controls, as well as between the different stages of NDCKD. Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients were employed to determine the effects of NDCKD duration on pRNFL thickness and MT. Results A total of 132 subjects were recruited, 66 with NDCKD and 66 controls. There was a statistically significant difference in superior (110.74 ± 23.35 vs 117.36 ± 16.17 μm, p = 0.022), nasal (65.97 ± 12.90 vs 69.35 ± 10.17 μm, p = 0.006), inferior quadrant (117.44 ± 23.98 vs 126.15 ± 14.75 μm, p = 0.006), average pRNFL (90.36 ± 14.93 vs 95.42 ± 9.87 μm, p = 0.005), CST (231.89 ± 26.72 vs 243.30 ± 21.05 μm, p = 0.006), average MT (268.88 ± 20.21 vs 274.92 ± 12.79 μm, p = 0.020) and average GC-IPL (75.48 ± 12.44 vs 81.56 ± 6.48, p = 0.001) values between the NDCKD group and controls. The superior quadrant (p = 0.007), nasal quadrant (p = 0.030), inferior quadrant (p = 0.047), average pRNFL (p = 0.006), average MT (p = 0.001) and average GC-IPL (p = 0.001) differed significantly between different stages of NDCKD. There was no correlation between pRNFL thickness and MT with duration of NDCKD. Conclusion CST, average MT, average GC-IPL thickness, average pRNFL and all quadrants of pRNFL except the temporal quadrant were significantly thinner in NDCKD patients compared to controls. These changes were associated with the severity of CKD, but not its duration."

https://openalex.org/W4224243908,"Background This study aimed to analyze falls regarding their demographic characteristics, severity, frequency over time, and the localization of injuries while high-altitude mountaineering in the Swiss Alps. Methods Data on fall-related emergencies during mountaineering between 2009 to 2020 from the Swiss Alpine Club central registry were analyzed retrospectively. The variables age, sex, time of occurrence, severity of an event quantified by NACA-Score (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Score), and injury localization were examined descriptively. Changes in injury severity, number of total emergencies, and fatal emergencies over time were analyzed using linear regression models. Results Out of 1347 (28.7%) victims of fall-related emergencies, 1027 were men (76.2%) and 320 (23.8%) women. Around 70% of the cases happened during summer in July and August. The mean age was 49.9 ± 14.9 years for men and 51.3 ± 14.4 years for women with no between-sex difference. Higher NACA-Scores were found in men than women (3.6 ± 2.2 vs. 3.1 ± 1.6; p &lt; 0.01). Approximately 80% of all victims originated from the countries close to the Alps (Switzerland, Germany, Italy, France, and Austria). There was a slight decrease of total cases (R 2 = 0.104) and fatal cases over time (R 2 = 0.183). NACA-Scores decreased over time (R 2 = 0.168). Likewise, risk aversion decreased over time as the severity of emergencies decreased. Injuries occurred predominantly at the extremities (90%). Out of all cases, 228 fatal emergencies (16.9%) could be identified of which 82 occurred while climbing one of the classic 4000ers. Conclusions The decrease of the number and severity implies that security standards of the average alpinist have in tendency increased. Nevertheless, the high number of emergencies on classic 4000ers implies that despite the potentially improved security standards, many tours on famous mountains still have high requirements in terms of alpine skills."

https://openalex.org/W4225596089,"Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a minimally invasive procedure, but patients may still experience intense pain, especially during the early postoperative period. Intrathecal morphine (ITM) is an effective pain control method that involves a simple maneuver and has a low risk of complications. This study aimed to study the effectiveness of ITM for pain control in patients who undergo VATS.A randomized controlled study was conducted who were in ASA classes 1-3, aged over 18 years, and scheduled for elective VATS. Patients were randomized into two groups: the ITM group (n = 19) received a single shot of 0.2 mg ITM before general anesthesia; and the control group (n = 19) received general anesthesia only. For 48 hours after surgery, other than intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA) morphine, patients received no sedatives or opioid medications except for 500 mg acetaminophen four times daily orally. Postoperative pain scores and IVPCA morphine used, side effects, sedation at specific time-points, i.e., 1, 6, 12, 24, and 48-hours and overall treatment satisfaction scores were assessed.Postoperative pain scores (median [IQR]) in ITM group were significantly lower than control group (repeated-measure ANOVA, p = 0.006) and differed at the first (7 [2, 7] vs 8 [6, 9], p = 0.007) and sixth hours (3 [2, 5] vs 5 [5, 7], p = 0.002). The cumulative dose of post-operative morphine (median [IQR]) in ITM group was also lower (6 [3, 20] vs 19 [14, 28], p = 0.006). The incidence of pruritus was significantly higher in ITM group (68.42% vs. 26.32%, p = 0.009). No significant differences in nausea and vomiting, sedation scores, and satisfaction scores were observed between the two groups.ITM could reduce pain scores and opioid consumption after VATS compared to IVPCA-opioids. However, pain scores and opioid consumption still remained high. No difference in patient satisfaction was detected."

The expression of CD4 in thymic hematopoietic cells is crucial for the thymic development and selection of T cells. In this study, we identified a novel CD4 mutant allele that emerged spontaneously in our mouse colony. The frameshift mutation led to a truncated CD4 protein which failed to reach the plasma membrane resulting in impaired development of CD4+ helper T cells. The CRISPR mediated correction of mutant allele restored the membrane CD4 expression. Further, using an adoptive transfer of T cells, we show that this model is an ideal recipient mouse for the study of CD4+ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W4226020581,"Impulse control disorders are detrimental neuropsychiatric symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Increased impulsivity is a predisposing factor for impulse control disorders and should therefore be controlled. Recently, mindfulness meditation as a non-drug therapy has been reported to be useful in improving neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as impulsivity.We performed a prospective single-arm, open-label pilot trial to investigate the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation to control impulsivity in patients with Parkinson's disease (UMIN clinical trials registry: UMIN000037779).Twenty patients with Parkinson's disease were enrolled in an 8-week mindfulness meditation program. As a primary outcome, we investigated whether the score of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) was significantly reduced after the intervention. As an exploratory examination, functional connectivity changes were also assessed by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. After the intervention, the BIS-11 score was decreased from 59.5 [55.6, 63.3] (mean [95% confidence interval]) to 55.2 [50.3, 60.1] (ΔBIS-11: -4.2, [-7.5, -0.9]). Functional connectivity was increased in the default mode network (DMN) at a cluster including the precuneus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and left posterior lobe (false discovery rate-adjusted p [FDR-p] = 0.046) and in the right frontoparietal network (FPN) at the medial frontal lobe (FDR-p = 0.039).This open-label, single-arm pilot study provided preliminary data for mindfulness meditation to control the impulsivity of patients with PD. A brief mindfulness meditation program may be effective in controlling impulsivity in PD and may change the functional connectivity of the DMN and right FPN."
https://openalex.org/W4226070594,"Thermal remote sensing is an important tool for monitoring regional climate and environment, including urban heat islands. However, it suffers from a relatively lower spatial resolution compared to optical remote sensing. To improve the spatial resolution, various ""data-driven"" image processing techniques (pan-sharpening, kernel-driven methods, and machine learning) have been developed in the previous decades. Such empirical super-resolution methods create visually appealing thermal images; however, they may sacrifice radiometric consistency because they are not necessarily sensitive to specific sensor features. In this paper, we evaluated a ""sensor-driven"" super-resolution approach that explicitly considers the sensor blurring process, to ensure radiometric consistency with the original thermal image during high-resolution thermal image retrieval. The sensor-driven algorithm was applied to a cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) scene of heterogeneous urban and suburban landscape that included built-up areas, low mountains with a forest, a lake, croplands, and river channels. Validation against the reference high-resolution thermal image obtained by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) shows that the sensor-driven algorithm can downscale the MODIS image to 250-m resolution, while maintaining a high statistical consistency with the original MODIS and ASTER images. Part of our algorithm, such as radiometric offset correction based on the Mahalanobis distance, may be integrated with other existing approaches in the future."
