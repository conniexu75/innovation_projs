https://openalex.org/W2052710730,A model is proposed predicting that in nectarivorous birds territorial behavior will occur above a lower threshold of nectar productivity in a foraging area and disappear above an upper threshold. These thresholds are determined by the daily costs of living of territorial and of nonterritorial individuals and by the pressure of competing birds for the resource. Decline of efficiency of territorial exclusiveness is predicted as productivity increases from the lower to the upper threshold. Hawaiian honeycreepers (Vestiaria coccinea) supported the model.

https://openalex.org/W2079739823,"Doubt is cast on the accuracy of the results reported by Frohliger and Kane concerning the acid character of rain. They do not believe that the pH of rainfall was ever controlled by the solubility of CO/sub 2/ in the precipitation and discredit the assumption that strong acids account for the presently observed pH value. The specific issue is exactly what acid species are responsible for the ambient pH values that Frohliger and Kane observed. Total acidity values as reported by them are informative but not adequate to answer this question. Only a complete chemical analysis of their samples would provide the necessary information. Lacking such independent data, total acidity values can be variously interpreted."
https://openalex.org/W2057178879,"Recently discovered mineral-produced, deeply incised striae and mirror-like polish on broken surfaces of limestone fragments from the sedimentary ejecta of the Ries impact crater of southern Germany are described. The striae and polish were produced under high confining pressures during high-velocity nonballistic transport of the ejecta mass within the time span of the cratering event (measured in terms of seconds). The striae on these fragments were produced by scouring by small mineral grains embedded in the surrounding clay matrix, and the polish was formed under the same condition, by movements of relatively fragment-free clay against the fragment surfaces. The occurrence of these striae and polish is key evidence for estimating the distribution and determining the relative importance of nonballistic and ballistic transport of ejecta from the shallow Ries stony meteorite impact crater."

https://openalex.org/W2046760604,"The immense reserves of the Rocky Mountain region are perceived to be the short- and mid-term answer to the energy crisis. The Federal government and the energy industry have prepared plans to develop western energy resources; these reserves would be of far greater value as future sources of hydrocarbons than as simple fuels for the present. Two major Federal plans show that the public is not aware, nor has it been informed, that severe energy, food, and materials shortages are imminent. The first proposal outlines the administration's plan to achieve the objectives of Project Independence. The second document, issued by the Department of the Interior in 1974, outlines the Federal government's plans to expand leasing of Federal coal lands and the reasons for doing so. The impacts not cited or considered in the documents are then reviewed. While admitting it is easier to criticize than to find solutions, the authors discuss five suggestions: the problem should be rationally and comprehensively assessed; specific plans must be developed; alternative energy futures should be considered; a commitment to preserve natural and social values is necessary; and commitment to public access and information is essential. The public and their elected representatives must define themore » optimum use of the nation's remaining energy reserves before an irrevocable decision is made concerning their fate. (MCW)« less"
