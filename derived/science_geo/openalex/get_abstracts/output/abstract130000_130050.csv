https://openalex.org/W1608218663,"Archaeoglobus fulgidus is the first sulphur-metabolizing organism to have its genome sequence determined. Its genome of 2,178,400 base pairs contains 2,436 open reading frames (ORFs). The information processing systems and the biosynthetic pathways for essential components (nucleotides, amino acids and cofactors) have extensive correlation with their counterparts in the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii. The genomes of these two Archaea indicate dramatic differences in the way these organisms sense their environment, perform regulatory and transport functions, and gain energy. In contrast to M. jannaschii, A. fulgidus has fewer restriction-modification systems, and none of its genes appears to contain inteins. A quarter (651 ORFs) of the A. fulgidus genome encodes functionally uncharacterized yet conserved proteins, two-thirds of which are shared with M. jannaschii (428 ORFs). Another quarter of the genome encodes new proteins indicating substantial archaeal gene diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2162710298,"Neurotrophins regulate neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic function. To understand how neurotrophins elicit such diverse responses, we elucidated signaling pathways by which brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activates gene expression in cultured neurons and hippocampal slices. We found, unexpectedly, that the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is an important regulator of BDNF-induced gene expression. Exposure of neurons to BDNF stimulates CREB phosphorylation and activation via at least two signaling pathways: by a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV)-regulated pathway that is activated by the release of intracellular calcium and by a Ras-dependent pathway. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized, CaMK-dependent mechanism by which neurotrophins activate CREB and suggest that CREB plays a central role in mediating neurotrophin responses in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2034946903,"Nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as an important endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis, and here we report that NO prevents hepatocyte apoptosis initiated by the removal of growth factors or exposure to TNFα or anti-Fas antibody. We postulated that the mechanism of the inhibition of apoptosis by NO would include an effect on caspase-3-like protease activity. Caspase-3-like activity increased coincident with apoptosis due to all three stimuli, and treatment with the caspase-3-like protease inhibitorN-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde inhibited both proteolytic activity and apoptosis. Endogenous or exogenous sources of NO prevented the increase in caspase-3-like activity in hepatocytes. Exposure of purified recombinant caspase-3 to an NO or NO+donor inhibited proteolytic activity. Dithiothreitol (DTT), but not glutathione, reversed the inhibition of recombinant caspase-3 by NO. When lysates from cells stimulated to express inducible NO synthase or cells exposed to NO donors were incubated in DTT, caspase-3-like activity increased to about 55% of cells not exposed to a source of NO. Similarly, administration of an NO donor to rats treated with TNFα and d-galactosamine also prevented the increase in caspase-3-like activity as measured in liver homogenates. The effect of the NO donor was reversed by about 50% if the homogenate was incubated with DTT. TNFα-induced apoptosis and caspase-3-like activity were also reduced in cultured hepatocytes exposed to 8-bromo-cGMP, and both effects were inhibited by the cGMP-dependent kinase inhibitor KT5823. The suppression in caspase-3-like activity in hepatocytes exposed to an NO donor was partially blocked by an inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one, (ODQ), while the incubation of these lysates in DTT almost completely restored caspase-3-like activity to the level of TNFα-treated controls. These data indicate that NO prevents apoptosis in hepatocytes by either directly or indirectly inhibiting caspase-3-like activation via a cGMP-dependent mechanism and by direct inhibition of caspase-3-like activity through proteinS-nitrosylation."

https://openalex.org/W2072414883,"The otd/Otx gene family encodes paired-like homeodomain proteins that are involved in the regulation of anterior head structure and sensory organ development. Using the yeast one-hybrid screen with a bait containing the Ret 4 site from the bovine rhodopsin promoter, we have cloned a new member of the family, Crx (Cone rod homeobox). Crx encodes a 299 amino acid residue protein with a paired-like homeodomain near its N terminus. In the adult, it is expressed predominantly in photoreceptors and pinealocytes. In the developing mouse retina, it is expressed by embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5). Recombinant Crx binds in vitro not only to the Ret 4 site but also to the Ret 1 and BAT-1 sites. In transient transfection studies, Crx transactivates rhodopsin promoter-reporter constructs. Its activity is synergistic with that of Nrl. Crx also binds to and transactivates the genes for several other photoreceptor cell-specific proteins (interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, beta-phosphodiesterase, and arrestin). Human Crx maps to chromosome 19q13.3, the site of a cone rod dystrophy (CORDII). These studies implicate Crx as a potentially important regulator of photoreceptor cell development and gene expression and also identify it as a candidate gene for CORDII and other retinal diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1987868279,"Neuropilin is a neuronal cell surface protein and has been shown to function as a receptor for a secreted protein, semaphorin III/D, that can induce neuronal growth cone collapse and repulsion of neurites in vitro. The roles of neuropilin in vivo, however, are unknown. Here, we report that neuropilin-deficient mutant mice produced by targeted disruption of the neuropilin gene show severe abnormalities in the trajectory of efferent fibers of the PNS. We also describe that neuropilin-deprived dorsal root ganglion neurons are perfectly protected from growth cone collapse elicited by semaphorin III/D. Our results indicate that neuropilin-semaphorin III/D-mediated chemorepulsive signals play a major role in guidance of PNS efferents."

https://openalex.org/W2120405274,"Syntaxin, vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) form a ternary ""core complex"" central to the process of synaptic vesicle docking and fusion. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the proteins assemble in a coiled-coil structure, but the alignment of alpha helices in this coil and the overall conformation of the coil are unknown. We employ the technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to investigate the alignment between syntaxin and VAMP. With the acceptor probe coupled to the amino-terminal end of the VAMP coiled-coil domain, the donor probe fluorescence is quenched to a greater extent when it is on the amino-terminal end of the syntaxin H3 domain than when it is on the carboxy-terminal end. The data indicate that syntaxin and VAMP bind primarily in a parallel arrangement and suggest a coiled-coil structure that is bent rather than fully extended. We propose a model in which binding of SNAP receptor (SNARE) protein coiled-coil domains helps drive vesicle fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1980221458,"We examined voltage-dependent conformational changes in three specific regions of the Shaker potassium channel with site-directed fluorescent labeling: the fourth transmembrane segment (S4), the second transmembrane segment (S2), and the putative pore region. The fluorescence changes displayed distinctive properties that correlate with gating, activation, and slow inactivation of the channel. The fluorescence signals measured near the S2 and S4 segments suggest that the S2 segment may undergo voltage-sensitive conformational changes that precede those in the S4 segment. In contrast, fluorescence changes in the pore correlated with the voltage dependence and time course of ionic activation and slow inactivation. Spectroscopy indicated that the mechanism of fluorescence change involves voltage-dependent quenching of the probe in an aqueous environment by other parts of the protein."

DNase I footprinting revealed that LPS stimulation induced protein binding to the two closely located NF-κB sites, A1 and A2. By electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay and supershift assay, the binding of (p65)2, c-Rel/p65, p50/p65, and p50/c-Rel to the A2 oligonucleotide probe was detected after LPS stimulation.

The binding of (p65)2 and/or c-Rel/p65 to the A2 probe was also detected from 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-stimulated HeLa, HOS, and A172 cells in which expression of MCP-1 mRNA was elevated. Finally, the role of the A1 site was investigated. Both (p65)2 and c-Rel/p65 bound to the A1 probe by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and a mutation in the A1 or A2 site resulted in a loss of the enhancer activity. These results suggest that the binding of (p65)2 and c-Rel/p65 to the A1 and A2 sites of this gene is important for the tissue- and stimulus-specific transcription of the human MCP-1gene.

Blood monocytes infiltrate into the sites of inflammation and play major roles in host defense through their ability to present antigens and to produce various mediators. Although the mechanisms of monocyte infiltration have not been fully understood, locally produced monocyte chemoattractants seem to be responsible for the recruitment of blood monocytes into the sites of inflammatory reactions.

A wide variety of cells, including monocytes, fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, produces MCP-1in vitro in response to various stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), IFN-γ, or 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) (1Yoshimura T.

However, the mechanisms of MCP-1 production remain unknown. To understand the mechanisms involved in the expression of human MCP-1 mRNA in different types of cells at the molecular level, we previously investigated the transcription of human MCP-1gene in TPA-, IL-1β-, and TNFα-stimulated human malignant glioma cell line A172 cells (12Ueda A. Okuda K. Ohno S. Shirai A. Igarashi T. Matsunaga K. Fukushima J. Kawamoto S. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2052-2063PubMed Google Scholar). The basal level of human MCP-1 mRNA was detected in A172 cells without any stimulus, and the expression of human MCP-1 mRNA was strongly enhanced after stimulation with these stimuli. The binding of Sp1 to the proximal GC box located between bp −64 and −59 was critical for the maintenance of the basal transcription of this gene. Two NF-κB sites (A1 and A2 sites) were located 2.6 kilobases upstream of the transcription initiation site. Mutations in the A2 sequence resulted in a loss of enhancer activity, indicating that the A2 site was critical for the enhancer activity after stimulation. The role of the A1 site was not investigated in the previous study. The mouse homologue of human MCP-1, termed JE, was cloned from PDGF-stimulated BALB/c 3T3 cells as one of early response genes (13Cochran B.J. Reffel A.C. Stiles C.D. Cell. 1983; 33: 939-947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 14Rollins B.J. Morrison E.D. Stiles C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3738-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The transcriptional mechanisms of the mouseMCP-1/JE gene was recently investigated. Ping et al. (15Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) investigated the regulatory site occupancy during the activation of mouse MCP-1 gene in TNFα-stimulated BALB/3T3 cells by using in vivo genomic footprinting. In response to TNFα, both distal promoter and proximal regulatory regions became occupied in vivo. The binding of (p65)2, p50/p65, and (p50)2 to the distal regulatory region of the mouse MCP-1 gene containing both NF-κB sites was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), but thetrans-activity of each NF-κB/rel dimer remains unclear. A remote NF-κB site on the mouse MCP-1 gene was also reported to be important for PDGF-induced mouse MCP-1 mRNA expression in BALB/c 3T3 cells (16Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K.K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These reports indicate the importance of the NF-κB sites located in the distal region of both the human and mouse MCP-1 genes. In our preliminary study, NF-κB (p50/p65) was activated in human B-lymphocytic IM9P3 cells and Raji cells without any stimulus. The binding of p50/p65 to the A2 site of the human MCP-1 gene was detected by EMSA. However, the expression of human MCP-1 mRNA was not detected in these cells. 2A. Ueda, Y. Ishigatsubo, T. Okubo, and T. Yoshimura, unpublished results. 2A. Ueda, Y. Ishigatsubo, T. Okubo, and T. Yoshimura, unpublished results. It has recently become evident that certain NF-κB/Rel dimers such as (p65)2 or c-Rel/p65 specifically regulate the transcription of certain genes (17Ahmad M. Marui N. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8976-8983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Oeth P. Parry G.C.N. Kunsch C. Nantermet P. Rosen C.A. Mackman N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, more detailed study on the interaction of the NF-κB sites and different NF-κB/Rel dimers is necessary to understand the mechanisms of the human MCP-1 gene expression. In the present study, we investigated the roles of two NF-κB sites, A1 and A2 sites, and different NF-κB/Rel dimers in the transcription of the human MCP-1 gene and have found that the binding of (p65)2 and c-Rel/p65 to both A1 and A2 sites elevates the transcription of this gene.

Filters were washed twice with 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at room temperature for 15 min and 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min before autoradiographic exposure. The probes used were human MCP-1 cDNA (22Yoshimura T. Yuuki N. Moore S.K. Appella E. Lerman M.I. Leonard E.J.

The Ig κ-chain NF-κB probe (25Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) was prepared by annealing an oligonucleotide 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ with its antisense oligonucleotide 5′-GCCTGGGAAAGTCCCCTCAACT-3′. Each binding reaction was performed in 10 μl of 1 × binding buffer (12 mmHEPES, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing a 10-fmol probe end-labeled with γ-[32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA, and 5 mg of each nuclear extract at 20 °C for 30 min. For competition assay, 50-fold excess amounts of appropriate unlabeled oligonucleotide were added to the binding reaction mixture. For supershift assay, appropriate antibody was incubated with nuclear extract in 1 × binding buffer at 20 °C for 30 min before the addition of 32P-labeled probe. The reaction was continued for 30 min at 20 °C. The gels were prerun at 200 V for 30 min and then run for another 3 h after samples were loaded. The pGLM-ENH plasmid was digested withXhoI, and the overhangs were filled in with α-[32P]dCTP, followed by a digestion withNotI. The resulting 400-bp fragment was isolated by gel electrophoresis on an agarose gel and purified. DNase I digestion was performed with 20 μg of nuclear extracts and 1 ng of the 400-bp fragment by the method described by Lefevre et al. (26Lefevre C. Imagawa M. Dana S. Grindlay J. Bodner M. Karin M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the digests were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gels. To obtain the pGLM-PRM, the 167-bp human MCP-1 promoter region between −107 and +60 was PCR amplified with a sense primer PS 5′-GGCTGAGCCCACTTATCACTCATGG-3′ and an antisense primer PAS 5′-GGAAGCTTGCTGGAGGCGAGAGTGCGAG-3′. This PCR product was gel purified, digested with XhoI and HindIII, and then ligated into the XhoI-HindIII site of the pGL3-basic plasmid. To obtain the pGLM-ENH, the 230-bp human MCP-1 enhancer region between −2742 and −2513 was PCR amplified with a sense primer ES 5′-GGGGTACCGAGATGTTCCCAGCACAG-3′ and an antisense primer EAS 5′-GGCTCGAGTGACAGCTGTCTGCCTCCC-3′. This PCR product was gel purified, digested with KpnI and XhoI, and then ligated into the KpnI-XhoI site of the pGL3-PRM. To obtain the mutated constructs, pGLM-MA1, pGLM-MA2, and pGLM-MA1A2, mutated antisense probes MA1 5′-ACGGGATCTaGaAACTTCCA-3′ and MA2 5′-GAGTGGGAATTcggACTCACTTCTCT-3′ were chemically synthesized, and two-step PCR mutagenesis method was performed. A172 cells and P19 cells were transiently transfected with 10 μg of luciferase plasmid DNA per 100-mm tissue culture plate by a calcium phosphate precipitation method (12Ueda A. Okuda K. Ohno S. Shirai A. Igarashi T. Matsunaga K. Fukushima J. Kawamoto S. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2052-2063PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with the DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate for 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated in fresh medium for 48 h in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml TPA. The luciferase assay was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. First, we investigated LPS- and TPA-induced MCP-1 mRNA expression in THP-1 cells by Northern analysis (Fig.1). The expression of MCP-1 mRNA was first detected 2 h after LPS stimulation (lane 3). The expression level increased at 8 h and reached the peak at 16 h (lanes 5 and 6). The same level of MCP-1 mRNA expression was maintained until 24 h (lane 7). In contrast, MCP-1 mRNA was not detected until 8 h after TPA stimulation (lanes 11–14). Addition of cycloheximide did not affect the expression of MCP-1 mRNA by LPS- or TPA-stimulated THP-1 cells (lanes 8, 9, 17, and18). The expression of IL-8 mRNA was also investigated (Fig.1). A rapid induction of IL-8 mRNA was detected with both TPA and LPS stimulation (lanes 2 and 11). Addition of cycloheximide superinduced IL-8 mRNA expression in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells (lanes 8 and 9). We previously identified two NF-κB binding sites, A1 and A2, in the enhancer region of the human MCP-1 gene (12Ueda A. Okuda K. Ohno S. Shirai A. Igarashi T. Matsunaga K. Fukushima J. Kawamoto S. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2052-2063PubMed Google Scholar). The enhancer region of the mouse MCP-1 gene was recently characterized by two independent groups (TableI). Freter et al. (16Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K.K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell.

Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that three regions (site A, κB-1, and κB-2) were occupied by proteins during the activation of the mouse MCP-1 gene in TNFα-activated NIH 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, element I, element III/site A, κB-1, and element IV/κB-2 of the mouse MCP-1gene are highly conserved in the human MCP-1 gene. However, element II of the mouse MCP-1 gene is not conserved in the human MCP-1 gene.Table IReported cis-elements and trans-activators involved in MCP-1 gene expressionFactorsSpeciesBinding sitesRegionsReferencesNF-κBHumanA1 and A2 NF-κB sitesDistal enhancer region12Ueda A.

Three regions were protected fromDNase I digestion after LPS or TPA stimulation. Regions 2 and 3 corresponded to the previously reported NF-κB binding sites, A1 and A2 (12Ueda A. Okuda K. Ohno S. Shirai A. Igarashi T. Matsunaga K. Fukushima J. Kawamoto S. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2052-2063PubMed Google Scholar). Region 1 was occupied before LPS or TPA stimulation (lanes 3 and 4) and seemed to be identical to the element III/site A of the mouse MCP-1 gene (15Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 16Freter R.R. Alberta J.A. Lam K.K. Stiles C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 315-325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constitutive protein binding to the element III/site A of the mouseMCP-1 gene was previously reported (15Ping D. Jones P.L. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1996; 4: 455-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These results suggest that three cis-elements (regions 1, 2, and 3) are likely to be involved in the enhancer activity of the humanMCP-1 gene. However, only LPS stimulation induces protein binding to A1 and A2 sites of the human MCP-1 gene. We performed EMSA to identify which NF-κB/Rel dimer bound to the A2 probe using the nuclear extracts of LPS- or TPA-stimulated THP-1 cells. As shown in Fig.3, four different DNA-nuclear protein complexes (C1, C2, C3, and C4) were found 2 h after LPS stimulation (lanes 1 and 2). The formation of the complexes was inhibited with an excess amount of the unlabeled A2 probe (lane 3) but not with the MA2 probe carrying three nucleotide substitutions (lane 4), indicating that these complexes were specific. We also performed EMSA with the A2 probe and nuclear extracts of TPA-stimulated THP-1 cells. Although a significant amount of MCP-1 mRNA was not detected 2–3 h after TPA stimulation by Northern analysis as shown in Fig. 1 (lane 13), the formation of C3 was detected 2 h after stimulation (lanes 5–7). The formation of C4 was also detected 16 h after stimulation when high level MCP-1 mRNA was detected (lanes 8–10 and Fig. 1, lane 15). Neither C1 nor C2 was detected after TPA stimulation. To identify the NF-κB/Rel subunit in the each complex, supershift assay was performed with a specific antibody against each NF-κB/Rel protein (19Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israël A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 20Mukaida N. Morita M. Ishikawa Y. Rice N. Okamoto S. Kasahara T. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13289-13295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, normal rabbit IgG or antibodies against p52, RelB, or CEBP/β had no effect on the complex formation with the A2 probe and nuclear extracts from LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells (lanes 3, 6–8). However, addition of anti-p50 supershifted both C3 and C4 (lane 2). C1, C2, and C3 were supershifted with anti-p65 (lane 4), and C2 and C4 were supershifted with anti-c-Rel (lane 5). These results indicated that C1, C2, C3, and C4 were (p65)2, c-Rel/p65, p50/p65, and p50/c-Rel, respectively. The complex formation after TPA stimulation was also characterized. C3, which was detected after a 2-h TPA stimulation (lane 9 and Fig. 3, lane 5), was supershifted by the addition of anti-p50 or anti-p65 (lanes 10and 12). Normal rabbit IgG and antibodies against p52, c-Rel, RelB, and CEBP/β had no effect on the complex formation (lanes 11, 13–17). These results indicated that a 2-h TPA stimulation could induce the binding of p65/p50 to the A2 site of the human MCP-1 gene. C3 and C4 detected after a 16-h TPA stimulation (Fig. 3, lane 8) contained p65/p50 and p50/c-Rel, respectively (data not shown). The binding affinity of each NF-κB/Rel dimer to a NF-κB site depends on the sequence of each NF-κB site (25Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 27Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israèl A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 135-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 28Kunsch C. Ruben S.M. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4412-4421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NF-κB binding sequences of different genes have been classified as the binding site for the heterodimer or homodimer of NF-κB/Rel proteins. As shown in Fig. 4, a 2-h LPS-stimulation induced the binding of (p65)2, c-Rel/p65, p50/p65, and p50/c-Rel to the A2 probe containing 5′-GGGAATTTCC-3′. Four different NF-κB/Rel dimers are capable of binding to the A2 site of the human MCP-1gene. Since the sequences of the human MCP-1 A1 site (5′-GGGAACTTCC-3′), hIL-8 NF-κB site (5′-TGGAATTTCC-3′), and Ig κ-chain NF-κB site (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) are different from that of the human MCP-1 A2 site, the binding affinity of NF-κB/Rel dimer to each NF-κB sequence could be different. As shown in Fig.5, the A1 probe as well as the A2 probe showed affinity to (p65)2, c-Rel/p65, p50/p65, and p50/c-Rel (lanes 1–5). In contrast, the IL-8 NF-κB probe showed affinity to (p65)2 and c-Rel/p65 but not to p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel (lanes 6–9). The Ig κ-chain NF-κB probe showed affinity to p50/p65 and p50/c-Rel but not to (p65)2or c-Rel/p65 (lanes 10–13). Thus, human MCP-1 NF-κB sites bind to a broader range of NF-κB/Rel family proteins compared with IL-8 or the Ig κ-chain NF-κB site. To investigate the trans-activity of each NF-κB/Rel dimer for the human MCP-1 gene transcription, P19 mouse embryonic carcinoma cells were cotransfected with pGLM-ENH containing the enhancer region of the humanMCP-1 gene and different combinations of pCMV-LD (p65 expression vector), pCMV-339 (p50 expression vector), and pCMV-NA (c-Rel expression vector). In P19 cells, endogenous NF-κB/Rel proteins were undetectable (29Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishino Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar), but Sp1, essential for the basal transcription of the human MCP-1 gene, was detectable (data not shown). A basal level of luciferase activity was detected after transfection with 15 μg of pGLM-ENH (Fig. 6,A–C). Cotransfection with p65 expression vector dose-dependently increased the luciferase a"
https://openalex.org/W1991954192,"We examined the function of basic-helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors during retinal neurogenesis. We identified Xath5, a Xenopus bHLH gene related to Drosophila atonal, which is expressed in the developing Xenopus retina. Targeted expression of Xath5 in retinal progenitor cells biased the differentiation of these cells toward a ganglion cell fate, suggesting that Xath5 can regulate the differentiation of retinal neurons. We examined the relationship between the three bHLH genes Xash3, NeuroD, and Xath5 during retinal neurogenesis and found that Xash3 is expressed in early retinoblasts, followed by coexpression of Xath5 and NeuroD in differentiating cells. We provide evidence that the expression of Xash3, NeuroD, and Xath5 is coupled and propose that these bHLH genes regulate successive stages of neuronal differentiation in the developing retina."

The components of the pathway transducing the mitogenic stimulus of IGF-I to the cell cycle machinery have been identified in part. The first step of IGF-I signaling involves its binding to the type 1 IGF surface receptor, consisting of two extracellular α-subunits and two membrane-spanning β-subunits (1Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petruzzelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.-C. Tsubokawa M. Mason A. Seeburg P.H. Grunfeld C. Rosen O.M. Ramachandran J. Nature. 1985; 313: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). The activated receptor functions as a tyrosine kinase. IRS-1, a 185-kDa protein, is an important substrate of this kinase and becomes extensively phosphorylated (2Izumi T. White M.F. Kadowaki T. Takaku F. Akanuma Y. Kasuga M. J. Biol.

Activated IRS-1 then serves as a multisite docking protein by binding through its phosphorylated residues to numerous SH2 domain-containing proteins. These include the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor Grb2/SOS (4Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S. Hu P.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar). Grb2/SOS binding subsequently results in activation of the proto-oncogenes p21ras and raf and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular response kinase (ERK) kinase MEK1, which activates the MAP kinases. Whether and how these pathways ultimately connect the surface receptor to the cell cycle components in the nucleus is still largely unknown. The effectiveness of IGF-I as a mitogen of the human breast cancer-derived MCF-7 cell line is well documented (12Karey K.P. Sirbashu D.A. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 4083-4092PubMed Google Scholar, 13Huff K.K. Kaufman D. Gabbay K.H. Spencer E.M. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 4613-4619PubMed Google Scholar, 14Van der Burg B.

These cells arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle upon withdrawal of serum, and the proliferative process may be restored by the addition of IGF-I at 10 ng/ml to the medium. In the present study, we have addressed the question whether the activation of the PI3-K and/or MAPK pathways is an essential step in the mitogenic action of IGF-I in MCF-7 cells. The MAPK signal transduction cascade derives its name from findings that suggest a key role for MAPK (i.e. Erk-1 and -2) in the proliferative process. MAPK activity is elevated in response to many different growth factors. Furthermore, a large number of oncogenes share the activation of MAPK as a common pathway (15Waskiewicz A.J. Cooper J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). The tumor promoting phorbol ester TPA is a strong inducer of MAPK activity and has been shown to be a mitogen of many different cell lines in vitro (16Winkelstein A. Simon P.L. Myers P.A. Weaver L.D. Exp. Hematol. 1986; 14: 1023-1028PubMed Google Scholar, 17Menapace L. Armato U. Whitfield J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1495-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, addition of TPA to other cell types, including MCF-7 cells, leads to inhibition of their growth, although activation of MAPK is clearly observed (19Valette A. Gas N. Jozan S. Roubinet F. Dupont M.A. Bayard F. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 1615-1620PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arita Y. O'Driscoll K.R. Weinstein I.B. Int. J.

This observation raises the question whether MAPK activation plays a role in growth induction as well as in growth inhibition in MCF-7 cells. Alternatively, the PI3-K activation triggered by many growth factors and also seen after addition of IGF-I to MCF-7 cells may be involved in the transduction of the mitogenic signal. To establish their involvement in mitogenic signaling, we have used specific and, by numerous reports, well documented inhibitors of PI3-K (wortmannin (22Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and LY294002 (23Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and of the MAPK-activating enzyme MEK1 (PD098059) (24Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). As parameters for mitogenic IGF-I signaling and of growth inhibitory TPA signaling, we have studied the levels of the G1 cyclin D1, hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein pRb, levels of DNA synthesis, and effects on cell numbers in cultures of MCF-7 cells. Induction of the D-type cyclins has been shown to constitute an essential step in coupling of mitogenic signaling cascades to the cell cycle machinery. This has recently been confirmed for MCF-7 cells, in which mitogenic signals from different classes of receptors were shown to converge at and to strictly require enhanced cyclin D1/cdk4 activity to induce S-phase (25Lukas J. Bartkova J. Bartek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6917-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Cyclins D2 and D3 are not expressed in MCF-7 cells, and thus cyclin D1 is the essential D-type cyclin (26Gorospe M. Liu Y. Xu Q. Chrest F.J. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, moderate overexpression of cyclin D1 has been shown to induce cell cycle progression under otherwise growth inhibiting low serum conditions in MCF-7 cells (27Zwijsen R.M.L. Klompmaker R. Wientjens E.B.H.G.M. Kristel P.M.P. Van der Burg B. Michalides R.J.A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2554-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the rise in cyclin D1 levels and the enhanced activity of the cyclin D1·cdk4 complex, in cooperation with the cyclin E·cdk2 complex, lead to hyperphosphorylation of pRb and passage of the so-called restriction point in late G1. Progression through the cell cycle then becomes growth factor-independent, and DNA replication during S-phase followed by cell division during M-phase ensues. Growth inhibitory agents on the other hand have been shown to often induce the synthesis of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs). These relatively small proteins inhibit the activity of cyclin·cdk complexes, preventing pRb from being hyperphosphorylated and thus causing arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Addition of TPA to MCF-7 cells stimulates the expression of one of the CKIs, p21WAF1/CIP1, which may account for the growth inhibition observed with this agent (28De Vente J.E. Kukoly C.A.

Here we report on the effects of the specific PI3-K and MEK1 inhibitors on the growth-stimulating IGF-I signal and on the growth-inhibiting TPA signal to establish the signal transduction routes involved in these processes in MCF-7 cells. Anti-cyclin D1 (H-295), anti-cyclin E (C19), anti-cdk2 (M2), anti-cdk4 (C22), anti-p21WAF1/CIP1 (H-164), and anti-Erk2 (C14) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-pRb (14001A) antibody was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies (rabbit anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit) were from Bio-Rad. The cyclin D1 probe, obtained from Dr. D. Beach (Cold Spring Harbor, NY), is a 1325-base pair polymerase chain reaction fragment encompassing the entire published human cDNA sequence of cyclin D1, cloned in the EcoRI site of the pUC118 vector (29Xiong Y. Connolly T. Futcher B. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 65: 691-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The p21 WAF1/CIP1 probe, kindly provided by Dr. R. H. Medema (Utrecht), is a 526-base pair human cDNA fragment. It was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a HeLa cell cDNA library using two oligonucleotide primers, a 5′-primer (5′-GGAATTCCATGTCAGAACCGGCTG-3′) and a 3′-primer (5′-GGAATTCCTGTGGGCGGATTAG-3′), based on the published sequence of the human p21 WAF1/CIP1 gene (30Mousses S. Ozcelik H. Lee P.D. Malkin D. Bull S.B. Andrulis I.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1089-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This fragment was cloned into theEcoRI site of pcDNA3. As a probe for GAPDH the cDNA sequence of rat GAPDH cloned in pBR322 was used (31Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. Sabrouty S.E. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M.

MCF-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/Ham's F12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, glutamine (300 μg/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) to a confluency of about 60%. Because of the known growth-stimulating effect of estrogens on MCF-7 cells (32Van der Burg B. Van Selm-Miltenburg A.J.P. De Laat S.W. Van Zoelen E.J.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1989; 64: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the cells were cultured for 24 h in phenol red-free medium containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-treated fetal calf serum, supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10 μg/ml transferrin, and 30 nm sodium selenite before starving the cells during 24 h in the same serum-free medium. LY294002 was purchased from Biomal Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA. PD098059 was from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, and wortmannin and rapamycin were from Sigma. Serum-starved cells (25-cm2flasks) were stimulated with IGF-I or TPA. After the incubation cells were washed with PBS and then scraped from the flasks in PBS. After centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 rpm the cells were suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by the Bradford protein assay (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein (5–10 μg) were size-separated in 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) to check for equal loading and blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h. Incubation with the first antibody was performed overnight at 4 °C (dilution 1:2500 in Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.2% Tween 20 (TBST)). Membranes were washed three times in TBST (15 min each time) and were exposed to horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies for 1.5 h at 4 °C (1:5000 in TBST). For detection the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc., Chalfont, UK) was used. Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were size-separated in 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblotting was performed overnight at 25 V. Membranes were blocked with 1% dried milk, 0.5% BSA in TBST. Incubation with anti-pRb antibody (1:500 in 1% dried milk, 0.5% BSA) was for 2.5 h at room temperature. Incubation with rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:5000 in 1% BSA) was for 1 h at room temperature. Assays were performed in 6-well plates. Serum-starved cells were stimulated with IGF-I for 5 min with or without preincubation with PD098059 for 1 h. After stimulation the culture medium was removed, and 100 μl of sample buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 6% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) was added to the cells. Lysates were immediately boiled for 5 min. Proteins were size-separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 1% dried milk in TBST. Incubation with the anti-MAPK antibody (1:8000 in TBST) was for 1 h at room temperature, and incubation with the second antibody (1:10,000 in TBST) was for 30 min at room temperature. Assays were performed in 75-cm2 flasks. Cells were treated with IGF-I and then washed with PBS and lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). A volume of lysate corresponding with 50 μg of protein was pre-cleared by incubation with 20 μl of 10% protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Lysates were then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of 10% protein A beads coupled to anti-cdk2 antibody. Beads were washed twice with IP buffer, twice with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and then resuspended in kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), supplemented with 20 μm ATP, 0.16 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP and 67 μg/ml histone H1 to a total volume of 25 μl. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, after which the reaction was stopped with 8 μl of 4 × sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 400 mm DTT, 8% SDS, 0.4% bromphenol blue, 40% glycerol). The suspension was boiled and centrifuged and the supernatant run on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to Fuji x-ray film. Assays were performed in 24-well plates. Serum-starved cells were given IGF-I or TPA. After 20 h of incubation 3H-labeled thymidine (2 μCi/ml) was added. Twenty-six h after the addition of IGF-I or TPA, cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed in water, and lysed in 0.1 m NaOH, followed by liquid scintillation counting. Assays were performed in 24-well plates. Serum-starved cells were stimulated with IGF-I or FCS. After incubation the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 12.5% glutaraldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with water and incubated with 0.05% methylene blue for 30 min, again rinsed with water, and then incubated with 200 μl of 0.33m HCl for 1 h to extract the methylene blue. Absorption was measured at 595 nm. Assays were performed in 75-cm2flasks. Serum-starved cells were given IGF-I with or without pretreatment with LY294002 or PD098059. After this incubation cells were trypsinized and then washed once in medium containing 10% FCS and once in cold PBS. Cells were then fixed overnight in 70% cold ethanol. After one wash in PBS cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of pepsin solution (0.5 mg/ml, 0.1 m HCl) for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were washed in 0.5% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA in PBS, and then resuspended in 1.5 ml of 2 m HCl for 12 min at 37 °C. After one wash in 0.1 m boric acid, pH 8.5, and one in 0.5% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA in PBS, cells were taken up in 500 μl of 0.1% BSA in PBS and treated with RNase A (12.5 μl, 10 mg/ml), and nuclei were stained with 0.5 μl of propidium iodide solution (1 mg/ml in sodium citrate (38 mm, pH 7.0)). DNA content was then determined by FACS scan analysis (Becton Dickinson). Cells from 25-cm2 flasks were washed with PBS and lysed in RNAzol B (Biotecx Laboratories Inc., Houston, TX). Total RNA was extracted and precipitated according to the manufacturer's instructions and dissolved in sterile water. Equal amounts of RNA (10 μg) were glyoxylated in 50% Me2SO and size-separated by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel. RNA was transferred to nylon membrane (GeneScreen, NEN Life Science Products) and cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation. The blots were prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in 50% deionized formamide, 1m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% BSA, 0.2% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.2% Ficoll 400, 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 200 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA. Hybridization was performed overnight in the same solution to which the specific 32P-labeled cDNA probes (106 cpm/ml) were added. The cDNA probes were labeled by random priming using Rediprime (Amersham Life Sciences Inc., Little Chalfont, UK). Membranes were exposed to Fuji x-ray films at −80 °C. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mmNa3VO4). Lysates were pre-cleared by incubation with 25 μl of 10% protein A-agarose beads pre-coupled to normal rabbit serum for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then incubated with 70 μl of 10% protein A-agarose beads, pre-coupled to anti-PKB antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice in IP buffer, twice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 m LiCl, 200 μmNa3VO4, and once in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μmNa3VO4. Beads were then resuspended in 25 μl of kinase mix (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 50 μm ATP) supplemented with 5 μg of histone 2B and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per sample. The mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, after which the reaction was stopped with 8 μl of 4 × sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 400 mm DTT, 8% SDS, 0.4% bromphenol blue, 40% glycerol). The suspension was boiled for 5 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was run on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to Fuji x-ray film. We studied, in a time course experiment, the progression of serum-starved MCF-7 cells through the G1 phase of the cell cycle after addition of IGF-I to the culture medium. Serum-starved MCF-7 cells were given IGF-I (10 ng/ml) and were harvested at different time points thereafter. Protein levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E and phosphorylation of pRb were determined by Western blotting. Furthermore, the activity of cdk2 and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was measured. Fig.1 shows that the level of cyclin D1 protein is clearly increased 4 h after the addition of IGF-I and that it remains at a high level until about 24 h after stimulation. The level of cdk4 protein does not change upon IGF-I addition (data not shown). Cyclin E levels become elevated at about 20 h after IGF-I addition, are maximal at about 24 h, and then rapidly decrease. Phosphorylation of pRb can first be seen at 16 h after IGF-I addition and increases strongly until at least 32 h after stimulation. Cdk2 activity, due to complex formation of cyclin E and of the more abundantly expressed S-phase cyclin A with cdk2, is observed from 24 h post-stimulation onward. These data are in agreement with the results on [3H]thymidine incorporation. DNA synthesis starts to increase strongly 24 h after the addition of IGF-I to the medium and reaches a maximum around 27 h post-stimulation (Fig.2 A). After 48 h a clear increase in cell number is observed, and after 72 h the initial number of cells has tripled (Fig. 2 B). The proliferation rate of the cells is dependent on the IGF-I concentration. A concentration of 10 ng/ml results in a rate comparable to that observed with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these data show that addition of IGF-I to the culture medium of quiescent MCF-7 cells results in progression through the G1phase of the cell cycle indicated by increased levels of cyclins D1 and E and by phosphorylation of pRb, S-phase entry indicated by the increase in cdk2 activity and DNA synthesis, followed by proliferation.Figure 2DNA synthesis and proliferation of MCF-7 cells in response to IGF-I and TPA. A, [3H]thymidine incorporation in MCF-7 cells. Serum-starved cells were given no mitogens (crosses), IGF-I (20 ng/ml, open circles), or TPA (100 ng/ml, closed triangles) and were harvested after the indicated periods. Labeled thymidine (2 μCi/ml) was added to the culture medium 1 h before harvesting. Incorporation into DNA was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Indicated values are means of triplicate wells. B, cells were serum-starved and subsequently maintained for up to 3 days in serum-free medium (open triangles) or in medium containing 10 ng/ml IGF-I (closed triangles). Every 24 h the cell number was determined using the methylene blue staining assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Indicated values are means of triplicate wells.C, serum-starved cells were cultured for 4 days in medium containing 5 or 10% FCS (hatched bars) or IGF-I in increasing concentrations (0.2, 1, 5, and 10 ng/ml, crossed bars). After this incubation methylene blue staining was performed. D, after starvation, cells were cultured for up to 3 days in serum-free medium containing 0.5% FCS (closed circles), 5% FCS (closed squares), or 5% FCS plus 10 ng/ml TPA (open squares). Cell numbers were determined every 24 h. E, serum-starved cells were given IGF-I (10 ng/ml), TPA (10 ng/ml), or a combination of IGF-I and TPA (both at 10 ng/ml). Labeled thymidine (2 μCi/ml) was added after 20 h of incubation, and incorporation was measured 6 h later as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Indicated values are means of triplicate wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The phorbol ester TPA strongly activates MAPK and is a known inhibitor of growth in MCF-7 cells. We confirmed this in a growth assay in which serum-starved cells were given 0.5% FCS, 5% FCS, or 5% FCS in combination with 10 ng/ml TPA. Addition of 5% FCS clearly stimulates proliferation. When TPA is added simultaneously, this stimulation is inhibited (Fig.2 D). Addition of IGF-I to quiescent MCF-7 cells results in an 18-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA between 20 and 26 h after stimulation in comparison to unstimulated control cells. Addition of TPA completely abolishes this increase in DNA synthesis (Fig. 2 E). To investigate the signal transduction routes by which IGF-I stimulates and TPA inhibits cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells, we studied the effects of both of these agents on cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells in the presence of specific inhibitors of key enzymes in the PI3-K and MAPK signal transduction pathways. As parameters for cell cycle progression, we studied the levels of cyclin D1 and, because TPA is known to induce synthesis of this protein (28De Vente J.E. Kukoly C.A. Bryant W.O. Posekany K.J. Chen J. Fletcher D.J. Parker P.J. Pettit G.J. Lozano G. Cook P.P. Ways D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1874-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), also of the CKI p21WAF1/CIP1. In addition, we measured hyperphosphorylation of pRb and DNA synthesis. MCF-7 cells, synchronized by serum starvation, were preincubated for 10 min with the specific PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 (50 μm) or the p70S6K inhibitor rapamycin (20 ng/ml). PI3-K activation by IGF-I and the effectiveness of LY294002 to block PI3-K activation in these cells were confirmed using an assay for PKB, an established downstream target of PI3-K (11Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar)(see “Activation of PKB by IGF-I” below). After these preincubations, IGF-I (10 ng/ml) or TPA was added. In some of the experiments described below, 100 ng/ml TPA was added to the cells, and in others 10 ng/ml was used. No significant differences in the effects of TPA at these two concentrations have been observed. The concentration of 10 ng/ml is sufficient for the maximal growth inhibitory effect. Cells were harvested 4 h later and cell lysates were analyzed by Northern and Western blotting. The results are shown in Fig. 3. Fig.3 A is a graphic representation of the PhosphorImager analysis of multiple Northern blots (as indicated in the figure legend) and Fig. 3 B is a representative Western blot. The IGF-I-induced increase in cyclin D1 mRNA and protein is completely abolished by addition of LY294002. Identical results were obtained using the unrelated PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin (data not shown). Distinct inhibition, although not complete, is also observed when the cells are preincubated with rapamycin. Surprisingly, TPA was found to induce cyclin D1 expression to an extent comparable to that observed with IGF-I. This TPA-induced increase in cyclin D1 is completely inhibited by LY294002 and partly by rapamycin, both at the mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3, A and B). This suggests that both IGF-I and TPA induce the synthesis of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein in quiescent MCF-7 cells via a PI3-K-dependent signal transduction route. Stimulation with IGF-I results in a slight increase in mRNA levels of the CKI p21WAF1/CIP1, when compared with untreated quiescent cells. This increase is not influenced by preincubation with LY294002 or rapamycin (Fig.4 A). The IGF-I-induced increase in p21WAF1/CIP1 protein is less pronounced (Fig.4 B). As expected, TPA causes a strong induction in both mRNA and protein levels of p21WAF1/CIP1 (Fig. 4,A and B). This induction is not inhi"

First, they mediate rapid desensitization by binding to G protein-coupled receptor kinase-phosphorylated receptors. Second, they target the receptors for internalization into endosomal vesicles, wherein receptor dephosphorylation and resensitization occur. Here we report that phosphorylation of a carboxyl-terminal serine (Ser-412) in β-arrestin1 regulates its endocytotic but not its desensitization function. Cytoplasmic β-arrestin1 is constitutively phosphorylated and is recruited to the plasma membrane by agonist stimulation of the receptors. At the plasma membrane, β-arrestin1 is rapidly dephosphorylated, a process that is required for its clathrin binding and receptor endocytosis but not for its receptor binding and desensitization. Once internalized, β-arrestin1 is rephosphorylated. Thus, as with the classical endocytic adaptor protein complex AP2, β-arrestin1 functions as a clathrin adaptor in receptor endocytosis which is regulated by dephosphorylation at the plasma membrane. β-Arrestins serve a dual regulatory role in the life cycle of G protein-coupled receptors such as the β2-adrenergic receptor.

In the case of G protein-coupled β2-adrenergic receptors, recent in vitro evidence has suggested that β-arrestins may play a role in linking the receptors to clathrin-coated pits (11Goodman Jr., O.B.

Following phosphorylation of the agonist-occupied receptors by β-adrenergic receptor kinase, β-arrestins bind to the receptors, thereby interdicting signal transduction to heterotrimeric G proteins (16Pippig S.

The arrestin family includes visual arrestin, β-arrestin1 (arrestin2), β-arrestin2 (arrestin3), and other splicing variants (17Sterne-Marr R. Benovic J.L. Vitam.

When β-arrestin1 or -2 are overexpressed in cells, not only is desensitization of β2-adrenergic receptors augmented, but their sequestration or internalization is promoted as well (20Ferguson S.S.G.

Moreover, a “dominant negative” mutant of β-arrestin1 (V53D) impairs receptor endocytosis (20Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G.

Despite these data suggesting a role for β-arrestin1 in clathrin-mediated β2-adrenergic receptor internalization, its role as an adaptor linking the receptors to clathrin cages has not been demonstrated in cells. Nor is anything known of how the putative association of β-arrestins and clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane might be regulated. Here we demonstrate that agonist-promoted recruitment and dephosphorylation of β-arrestin1 on the plasma membrane transforms it into a clathrin adaptor and thus controls the process of receptor endocytosis.

Then an oligonucleotide 5′-CATCACCATCACCATCAC-3′, encoding six histidine residues, was engineered at the end of the carboxyl-terminal coding sequences by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and designated pKK/βarr1–6xHis. This PCR product was verified by DNA sequencing. To express His-tagged β-arrestin1 in mammalian cells, a 0.5-kb 5′ EcoRI fragment of β-arrestin1 from pCMV5/βarr1 (15Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C.

The β-arrestin1–6xHis coding sequences, removed from pKK/βarr1–6xHis by KpnI and HindIII digestions, were subcloned into pBluescript KS(+). This plasmid was then linearized at the XhoI or XbaI site of the polylinkers as a template for mutagenesis by recombination PCR (21Jones D.H. Winistorfer S.C. BioTechniques. 1992; 12 (520): 528PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotides TCT, encoding serine at amino acid 412, were replaced with GCT or GAT which mutates the serine to alanine or aspartic acid. The PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. To express mutant β-arrestin1, the 0.3-kb 3′ SmaI fragment of pCMV5/βarr1–6xHis was replaced with a corresponding fragment containing the mutated site and designated pCMV5/(S412A)βarr1–6xHis or pCMV5/(S412D)βarr1–6xHis. The plasmids of interest were transfected into HEK 293 cells by calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Stable cell lines were generated by co-transfecting empty vector or different β-arrestin1–6xHis expression plasmids with pSV2Neo at a 10:1 ratio and were then selected with 400 μg/ml G418 for 2–3 weeks. Overexpression of wild-type or mutant β-arrestin1 was determined by Western blot analysis using an antibody specific to β-arrestin1 (15Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence assay (ECL, Amersham Corp.). For metabolic labeling, HEK 293 cells stably transfected with pCMV5/βarr1–6xHis were starved in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min, labeled for 2 h in the same medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml), and harvested for β-arrestin1 purification. The stoichiometry of32P-labeled β-arrestin1 was determined as described (22Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells incubated with or without 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated with 250 μg/ml concanavalin A in PBS on ice for 20 min, scraped into 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, and disrupted by Dounce homogenization. Differential centrifugation was carried out as described (23Graham J.M. Dealtry G.B. Rickwood D. Cell Biology labfax. Academic Press, Oxford, UK1992Google Scholar). Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. A crude plasma membrane fraction was precipitated by centrifugation of the supernatant at 3000 × g for 15 min. Then centrifugation of the resulting supernatant at 300,000 × g for 30 min gave rise to a pellet composed of the vesicles and other subcellular organelles as well as a supernatant containing cytosol. The cytosol was dialyzed in 1 × binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 5 mm imidazole, and 0.5 m NaCl) containing 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and a mixture of protease inhibitors for β-arrestin1 purification. The cell pellets were lysed in 1 × binding buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors and 0.2% Nonidet P-40. To purify phospho-β-arrestin1, 50 mm NaF and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate were also added to inhibit phosphatase activity. β-Arrestin1 was purified by Nickel Affinity Chromatography following the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen) except that following washing with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, containing 30 mm imidazole and 0.5 m NaCl, it was eluted with 100 mm imidazole in the same buffer. To purify β-arrestin1 to the highest homogeneity, the 100 mm imidazole eluate was dialyzed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.2 m NaCl and applied to heparin-Sepharose as described (24Sohlemann P. Hekman M. Puzicha M. Buchen C. Lohse M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin1 was purified with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.2 to 1 m (a regular procedure) or directly eluted with 1 m NaCl (as shown in Fig. 3) and was desalted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 2 mm EDTA. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The purity of β-arrestin1 was determined by either Coomassie Blue staining or silver staining (Bio-Rad) of the gel. Phosphorylated β-arrestin1 was purified by nickel affinity chromatography, electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon PVDF, Millipore), and then eluted (25Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Proteins were hydrolyzed in 6n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The hydrolysates were lyophilized, combined with phosphoamino acid standards, and fractionated by one-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis as described (26Hirano A.A. Greengard P. Huganir R.L. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 1447-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid standards were stained with ninhydrin, and radiolabeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. Proteins transferred to PVDF membranes were digested in situwith modified sequencing-grade trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim) and purified by reverse-phase HPLC as described (27Fredericks Z.L.

Radiolabeled peptides were collected for amino acid sequencing using an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer with an in-line 120A PTH-analyzer (Protein Chemistry Core Facility, Baylor College of Medicine). HEK 293 cells were transiently co-transfected with pcDNA1/FLAG-β2AR (28Oppermann M. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two days after transfection, cells were incubated with or without 10 μm(−)-isoproterenol in PBS for 5 min and then dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) was added for cross-linking as described (29Freedman N.J.

Cells were scraped into the lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) with 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors and briefly sonicated. Insoluble proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The expression levels of wild-type or mutant β-arrestin1 were determined by Western blot analysis using 5% of the lysates from a 10-cm plate. For the rest of the samples, the FLAG-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor was immunoprecipitated with the M2 antibody directed aganist the FLAG epitope (Kodak). Then the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed using the antibody specific to β-arrestin1. For desensitization assays, the cells described above were incubated in serum-free medium either alone (control cells) or in the presence of 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol for 5 min at 37 °C (desensitized cells). After washing with cold PBS on ice, cells were scraped in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μm microcystin, and a mixture of protease inhibitors), homogenized, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min to pellet nuclei and debris. Crude membranes were isolated by centrifugation of the supernatant at 40,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 75 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 15 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors. Cyclase assays were performed as described (30Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3202-3211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples containing 10 μg of membrane protein, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.8 mm EDTA, 6 mm MgCl2, 120 μm [3H]ATP (50 μCi/ml), 100 μm cAMP, 53 μm GTP, 2.7 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 20 units/ml myokinase, 4 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and either 10 μm forskolin or 10 μm(−)-isoproterenol were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. Assays were terminated by placing the samples on ice and adding 1 ml of 0.3 mm ATP and 0.3 mm [14C]cAMP. The amount of cAMP generated was determined (31Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected HEK 293 cells, as described above, were aliquoted into 6-well dishes. Two days after transfection, they were incubated with or without 10 μm(−)-isoproterenol in 0.1 mm ascorbic acid for 30 min followed by sequestration assays as described (32Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated at 14 °C for 3 h with [125I]cyanopindolol either alone (to define total receptors) or in the presence of CGP-12177 (a hydrophilic ligand binding to cell-surface receptors only) or in the presence of propranolol (to define nonspecific binding). The agonist-promoted receptor sequestration was determined as the percentage of radiolabeled binding not competed by CGP-12177 measured with agonist exposure minus that without agonist treatment. One 150-mm plate of stable HEK 293 cells transfected with pCMV5 empty vector or β-arrestin1 (wild-type, S412A, or S412D) were homogenized and subjected to subcellular fractionation. After removing nuclei and unbroken cells by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, all of the membrane fractions were pelleted by centrifugation of the supernatant at 300,000 × g for 30 min and dissolved in lysis buffer (same as that used in receptor binding described above). β-Arrestin1 was immunoprecipitated using an antibody directed against β-arrestin1 (15Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed using a monoclonal antibody specific to the heavy chain of clathrin (ICN). To investigate the functional role of β-arrestin1 in β2-adrenergic receptor endocytosis, we established a line of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably overexpressing β-arrestin1, tagged at its carboxyl terminus with hexahistidine. Purification of the β-arrestin1 to >95% homogeneity could be achieved by a two-step procedure as follows: a first step on a nickel-chelating column, followed by a heparin-Sepharose column (Fig.1, A and B). To determine if cellular β-arrestin1 is a phosphoprotein, HEK 293 cells overexpressing β-arrestin1 were metabolically labeled with32Pi, and then β-arrestin1 was purified from whole cell extracts by nickel affinity chromatography and was subjected to SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2, the 50-kDa β-arrestin1, which was not present in the mock transfectant, was clearly phosphorylated. The stoichiometry of phospho-β-arrestin1 from whole cell extracts was ∼0.84 mol of Pi/mol of protein, suggesting a potential physiological relevance of this modification. These results are consistent with our previous observations that the immunoprecipitated native β-arrestin1 from overexpressing COS-7 cells is a phosphoprotein.2 Moreover, we have determined that the function of the hexahistidine-tagged β-arrestin1 is equivalent to that of native β-arrestin1 as assayed by the binding to β2-adrenergic receptors and the promotion of receptor desensitization and internalization (see below). Accordingly, since it is much easier to purify, the tagged β-arrestin1 was used for all subsequent studies. To study the potential effects of agonist stimulation on the phosphorylation status of β-arrestin1, HEK 293 cells overexpressing β-arrestin1 were labeled with32Pi and subsequently incubated either alone or with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol for 10 min. β-Arrestin1 was then purified from whole cell extracts by nickel affinity chromatography. Under these conditions, a modest 20% reduction of β-arrestin1 phosphorylation was observed (data not shown). As the bulk of β-arrestin1 is cytosolic (∼70%, data not shown), we thought this agonist-induced dephosphorylation event might be limited to a particular subcellular location. Therefore, the phosphorylation status of β-arrestin1 isolated from several different cellular fractions was examined. After metabolic labeling and treatment with or without isoproterenol for 5 min, cells were fractionated by differential centrifugation into low speed “plasma membrane,” high speed “crude vesicle,” and supernatant “cytosol” fractions (see “Experimental Procedures”). β-Arrestin1 was purified from each of these fractions by the two-step procedure shown in Fig. 1. The results are shown in Fig. 3, where similar amounts of β-arrestin1 were loaded in each lane. β-Arrestin1 isolated from the plasma membrane was almost completely dephosphorylated, and hence no agonist effect could be observed. Cytosolic β-arrestin1 was significantly phosphorylated (1.02 mol Pi/mol protein) and showed a slight decrease after agonist treatment. The most pronounced agonist-induced dephosphorylation of β-arrestin1 was observed in the crude vesicle fraction, which showed a 50% decrease in phosphorylation after a 5-min isoproterenol treatment of the cells. If the plasma membrane is the site of β-arrestin1 dephosphorylation, then an obvious explanation for the agonist-promoted decrease of β-arrestin1 phosphorylation in crude vesicles is an agonist-promoted transit of dephosphorylated β-arrestin1 from plasma membrane to the internalized vesicles. This seemed a reasonable hypothesis since isoproterenol stimulates the association of β-arrestins with plasma membrane β2-adrenergic receptors, as judged by receptor desensitization as well as receptor translocation from plasma membrane to a vesicular fraction. To confirm this notion, we treated cells with isoproterenol for 5 min, isolated plasma membrane and vesicle fractions, and assessed their β-arrestin1 content by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 4, both fractions showed an agonist-promoted increase in β-arrestin1. Taken together, these data suggest that agonist stimulation of β2-adrenergic receptors promotes translocation of β-arrestin1 to the plasma membrane, which is the site of its dephosphorylation. To identify the physiologically relevant sites of β-arrestin1 phosphorylation, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis on phosphorylated β-arrestin1 purified from HEK 293 cells overexpressing β-arrestin1. As shown in Fig.5 A, phosphate was incorporated almost exclusively on serine. Trypsin-digested phospho-β-arrestin1 was then analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC, followed by protein sequencing of the two major phosphopeptides (Fig. 5 B). These results revealed that Ser-412, which is located seven residues from the carboxyl terminus, is the only phosphorylation site. Interestingly, this serine is only present in β-arrestin1 and not in other arrestin family members. To confirm the assignment of Ser-412 as the physiologically relevant site of β-arrestin1 phosphorylation, we prepared a point mutation in which Ser-412 was substituted with alanine. S412A β-arrestin1 was expressed in HEK 293 cells at levels similar to wild-type (Fig.6). However, this single mutation virtually eliminated phosphorylation of β-arrestin1 (Fig. 6). Further confirming this conclusion was the absence, by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of S412A β-arrestin1, of the two partial tryptic digestion products shown in Fig. 5 B (data not shown). To investigate how phosphorylation regulates the activities of β-arrestin1 within the cell, we utilized two mutant β-arrestin1 expression vectors where Ser-412 was replaced with Ala or Asp. The S412A mutant should simulate the unphosphorylated form of β-arrestin1, whereas S412D would be predicted to mimic its phosphorylated form. We then set out to investigate the biological properties of the wild-type and mutant proteins expressed in 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 7 A(upper panel), the three proteins were expressed at similar levels. We first investigated the ability of each β-arrestin1 to interact with the agonist-occupied receptors. Cells expressing β2-adrenergic receptor and either wild-type or mutant β-arrestin1 were treated with isoproterenol for 5 min and subjected to reversible cross-linking with Dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). The receptors were immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed at the FLAG epitope (see “Experimental Procedures”). After SDS-PAGE, co-immunoprecipitating β-arrestin1 was visualized by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 7 A (lower panel), isoproterenol treatment of cells strikingly increased β-arrestin/receptor interaction. However, neither mutation of Ser-412 altered receptor/β-arrestin1 interaction. The failure of these mutations to alter receptor binding of β-arrestin1 is consistent with previous observations indicating that the carboxyl domain of β-arrestins is not involved in this interaction (33Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We next examined the ability of different β-arrestin1 proteins to desensitize the receptors. Previously it has been demonstrated that overexpression of β-arrestin1 enhances desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (16Pippig S. Andexinger S. Daniel K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3201-3208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 B, when expressed at equal levels, wild-type β-arrestin1 and its two mutants, S412A and S412D, equally augmented desensitization of the β2-adrenergic receptor. In view of the apparently unchanged receptor-binding ability of the two mutants (Fig.7 A), this finding is not surprising. As noted earlier β-arrestins appear to be bifunctional molecules, binding to and desensitizing receptors on the one hand and targeting them for internalization on the other (20Ferguson S.S.G. Downey III, W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we next assessed the effects of phosphorylation of β-arrestin1 on its ability to promote receptor sequestration. These data are shown in Fig.8. Overexpression of wild-type β-arrestin1 significantly increased β2-adrenergic receptor sequestration, causing a doubling in the percentage of surface receptors internalized after a 30-min incubation with isoproterenol. Interestingly, the S412A mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated, enhanced receptor internalization to an even greater extent. In contrast, the S412D mutant, which would be predicted to mimic the phosphorylated form of β-arrestin1, failed to increase receptor sequestration and in fact acted as a dominant negative mutant and significantly reduced it. These data are consistent with the notion that dephosphorylation of β-arrestin1 is required for internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor. Previously published data (11Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar) have indicated that β-arrestins bind to clathrin cages in vitroand that the carboxyl-terminal 77 amino acid residues of β-arrestins are important for this interaction. Alanine scanning mutagenesis further localized the clathrin-binding domain to residues 371–379 of β-arrestin2 (12Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). It was also shown, in intact cells, that β-arrestin1 and clathrin co-localize by immunofluorescent microscopy after isoproterenol stimulation. Since Ser-412 is located within the carboxyl domain of β-arrestin1 previously shown to be involved in itsin vitro binding to clathrin cages, we sought to investigate the potential regulatory role of Ser-412 phosphorylation in determining the ability of β-arrestin1 to serve as a clathrin adaptor in intact cells. A 300,000 × g particulate fraction from HEK 293 cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant β-arrestin1 at equivalent levels (Fig. 9, upper panel) was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-β-arrestin1 antibodies. After SDS-PAGE, the immunoprecipitates were blotted for clathrin heavy chain (Fig. 9, lower panel). Clathrin was detected only in the immunoprecipitated complex of S412A β-arrestin1. The failure to detect specific clathrin binding to the wild-type β-arrestin1 likely reflects the fact that it is already highly phosphorylated. S412D β-arrestin1, which mimics phosphorylated β-arrestin1, also did not co-immunoprecipitate with clathrin heavy chain. Our data suggest the following model for the regulation of β2-adrenergic receptor desensitization and internalization by β-arrestin1. Prior to agonist stimulation, the bulk of β-arrestin1 is cytosolic and is a phosphoprotein. The phosphate is present almost exclusively on Ser-412. The nature of the kinase(s) that is responsible for this phosphorylation is currently unknown. Following agonist stimulation, β-arrestin1 is translocated to the plasma membrane where it binds tightly to agonist-occupied receptors that have been phosphorylated by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase such as β-adrenergic receptor kinase. In association with its movement to the plasma membrane, β-arrestin1 is dephosphorylated by an as yet unknown phosphatase. It is not presently clear whether β-arrestin1 dephosphorylation precedes or follows its receptor binding. Even in the absence of receptor stimulation, plasma-membrane β-arrestin1 is dephosphorylated (Fig. 3). It is known that β-arrestin1 can bind to β2-adrenergic receptors even in the absence of agonist, albeit with lower affinity (Fig. 7 A). Moreover, the concentrations of overexpressed β2-adrenergic receptors in our experiments are likely high enough to promote just such agonist-independent binding of β-arrestin1 to the receptors. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 7 A, phosphorylation of Ser-412 does not seem to regulate receptor binding of β-arrestin1. Thus, it is not necessary for the dephosphorylation to precede β-arrestin1 binding to the receptors. It seems plausible that such receptor binding of β-arrestin1 positions it in proximity to the relevant phosphatase or alters its conformation such that it becomes a substrate for the phosphatase. Since receptor binding of β-arrestin1 does not appear to require its dephosphorylation, it is not surprising that receptor desensitization is also unaffected by the phosphorylation status of β-arrestin1 (Fig. 7 B). Once β-arrestin1 has bound to the β2-adrenergic receptor and the receptors have become functionally uncoupled from G proteins, they move to clathrin-coated pits and become internalized. As shown here, the dephosphorylated form of β-arrestin1 seems to uniquely function as a clathrin adaptor targeting the desensitized receptors for internalization by this pathway. In fact, S412D β-arrestin1, which mimics the phosphorylated form of β-arrestin1, actually acts as a dominant negative mutant with respect to receptor internalization (Fig. 8). As dephosphorylated β-arrestin1 moves into the internalized vesicular fraction of the cells along with the receptors, the overall phosphorylation status of β-arrestin1 in this cellular fraction transiently drops. Once internalized, the receptors arrive in late endosomes and become dephosphorylated by the G protein-coupled receptor phosphatase (34Pitcher J.A. Payne E.S. Csortos C. Depaoli-Roach A.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8343-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that the low endosomal pH uniquely induces a conformational change of the receptor which is then subjected to dephosphorylation (35Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Subsequently the receptors recycle to the cell surface by incompletely characterized mechanisms. The exact time at which β-arrestin1 falls off the receptor (presumably prior to receptor dephosphorylation) and the cellular locus of β-arrestin1 rephosphorylation are not yet known. Why should β-arrestin1 dephosphorylation be necessary for its clathrin interaction? Previous in vitro studies have revealed that the carboxyl terminus of β-arrestin1 interacts with clathrin (11Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Presumably dephosphorylation of the very carboxyl-terminal Ser-412 alters the conformation and/or charge of this region of the β-arrestin1 molecule so that the acidic carboxyl terminus can bind to clathrin cages. It is of further interest that Ser-412 is not present in the other members of the arrestin family. Thus, they must be regulated either by phosphorylation at other sites or by totally different mechanisms. β-Arrestin1 seems to function as an adaptor linking activated β2-adrenergic receptors, and presumably other G protein-coupled receptors, to clathrin cages. Recently, comparisons have been made between the clathrin adaptor functions of β-arrestins and the AP2 complex (13Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15017-15022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A number of distinctions were drawn between these two molecules. First, the AP2 complex is a large multi-subunit entity containing four distinct proteins, whereas β-arrestins are monomeric. Second, AP2 was shown to bind to clathrin at two distinct sites, whereas β-arrestins bind a single site (13Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Keen J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23768-23773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, unlike the AP2 complex, which supports clathrin-coat assembly in vitro, β-arrestins do not. However, it should be pointed out that β-arrestins might recruit additional as yet unrecognized proteins into their complexes with clathrin. However, there are clear analogies between β-arrestins and AP2 as well. These include the fact that both β-arrestins and AP2 bind to clathrin and to the receptors. In the case of the AP2 complex, these receptors include the low density lipoprotein receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, asialoglycoprotein receptor, and mannose 6-phosphate receptor (38Pearse B.M.F. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 39Sorkin A. Carpenter G. Science. 1993; 261: 612-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 40Beltzer J.P. Spiess M.

Another analogy, revealed by our study, is that only dephosphorylated β-arrestin1 can bind to clathrin, just as in vitro clathrin binding assays have shown that only dephosphorylated AP2 can bind to clathrin (42Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, the β2 subunit of the cytosolic AP2 complex is phosphorylated on serine residues, whereas membrane-bound AP2 is unphosphorylated (42Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These data suggest that adaptor phosphorylation may generally regulate adaptor-clathrin interaction on the plasma membrane. This mechanism would provide a potential means for bringing such endocytic processes under the control of receptor-mediated signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2081985979,"We found that magnocellular oxytocin neurons in adult female rats exhibit an endogenous GABAA receptor subunit switch around parturition: a decrease in α1:α2 subunit mRNA ratio correlated with a decrease in allopregnanolone potentiation and increase in decay time constant of the GABAA receptor-mediated IPSCs in these cells. The causal relationship between changes in α1:α2 mRNA ratio and the ion channel kinetics was confirmed using in vitro antisense deletion. Further, GABAA receptors exhibited a tonic inhibitory influence upon oxytocin release in vivo, and allopregnanolone helped to restrain oxytocin neuron in vitro firing only before parturition, when the α1:α2 subunit mRNA ratio was still high. Such observations provide evidence for the physiological significance of GABAA receptor subunit heterogeneity and plasticity in the adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W1995136282,"Previous studies have shown that both the Fasciclin II (Fas II) cell adhesion molecule and the Shaker potassium channel are localized at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, where they function in the growth and plasticity of the synapse. Here, we use the GAL4-UAS system to drive expression of the chimeric proteins CD8-Fas II and CD8-Shaker and show that the C-terminal sequences of both Fas II and Shaker are necessary and sufficient to drive the synaptic localization of a heterologous protein. Moreover, we show that the PDZ-containing protein Discs-Large (Dlg) controls the localization of these proteins, most likely through a direct interaction with their C-terminal amino acids. Finally, transient expression studies show that the pathway these proteins take to the synapse involves either an active clustering or a selective stabilization in the synaptic membrane."

KN-93, an inhibitor of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase II), blocked the induction of these responses by the α1-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine, whereas its inactive analog KN-92 did not. To directly determine whether CaM kinase II could regulate ANF gene expression, we transiently expressed each of three isoforms of CaM kinase II (α, δB, and δC) along with an ANF promoter/luciferase reporter gene. The δB isoform markedly increased luciferase gene expression, whereas comparable levels of the δC and α isoforms were ineffective. Expression of δB-CaM kinase II also potentiated phenylephrine-mediated ANF gene expression, and this effect was blocked by KN-93 but not by KN-92.

The δB isoform of CaM kinase II has been shown to exhibit nuclear localization. Coexpression of the non-nuclear δC or α isoforms, which can form multimers with the δB isoform, prevented the nuclear localization of δB-CaM kinase II and also blocked its effects on ANF reporter gene and protein expression. In addition, a chimeric α-CaM kinase II which contains the nuclear localization signal of the δB isoform was able to induce ANF reporter gene expression, albeit to a lesser extent than δB-CaM kinase II.

A role for Ca2+ signaling in myocardial hypertrophy is suggested by several lines of evidence. Overexpression of calmodulin, an intracellular Ca2+-binding protein, results in myocardial hypertrophy in transgenic mice (1Gruver C.L. DeMayo F. Goldstein M.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 376-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In cultured cardiac myocytes, elevated extracellular Ca2+ (2LaPointe M.C. Deschepper C.F. Wu J. Gardner D.G.

Electrical pacing also elevates intracellular Ca2+, and cardiac myocytes respond with increased expression of ANF as well as of myosin light chain-2, another marker of hypertrophy (4McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, blockade of depolarization-induced Ca2+ entry prevents specific increases in gene expression associated with cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (3Sei C.A. Irons C.E. Sprenkle A.B. McDonough P.M.

In addition, both pacing and α1-AdrR-induced ANF expression in cultured myocytes can be blocked by the calmodulin antagonist W-7 (3Sei C.A. Irons C.E. Sprenkle A.B. McDonough P.M. Brown J.H.

The multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, also referred to as CaM kinase II, is a well-known effector of the actions of Ca2+ and calmodulin. This protein kinase has been shown to phosphorylate myocardial proteins involved in Ca2+ transport, including the ryanodine receptor, the sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+-ATPase, and phospholamban (6Witcher D.R.

CaM kinase II functions as a multimer consisting of 8–12 subunits, which range in size from 51–60 kDa and are derived from one of four (a, β, γ, and δ) genes (reviewed in Refs. 12Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar and 13Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). The α isoform, the best characterized CaM kinase II, is found primarily in brain and has been shown to regulate neuronal function including memory formation and neurite outgrowth (12Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 14Mayford M. Bach M.E. Huang Y. Wang L. Hawkins R.D. Kandel E.R.

A constitutively activated form of α-CaM kinase II has been shown to induce transcriptional activation of the c-fos promoter through the serum response element (SRE) in mesangial cells (16Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The δB and δC isoforms of CaM kinase II were recently cloned from rat heart, and δB was determined to be the predominant isoform of CaM kinase II in the heart (17Schworer C.M. Rothblum L.I. Thekkumkara T.J. Singer H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14443-14449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Edman C.F. Schulman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The δB- and δC-CaM kinase II isoforms differ only by an 11-amino acid sequence in their variable region. Interestingly, this sequence contains a nuclear localization signal which is absent from the δC and previously described α isoform of CaM kinase II (19Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). At present, no specific function has been attributed to the δ isoform of CaM kinase II. In light of the evidence implicating CaM kinase in cardiac hypertrophy and in regulating c-fos gene expression we hypothesized that CaM kinase II might contribute to the increased gene expression seen in a cell model of cardiac hypertrophy. The studies reported here demonstrate that in cardiac myocytes transient expression of the δB but not other isoforms of CaM kinase II leads to transcriptional activation of ANF gene expression, mediated in part through an SRE, and associated with the localization of CaM kinase II to the nucleus. Neonatal ventricular myocytes from 1–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were plated at a density of 4 × 104/cm2 on 60-mm gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes or 25-mm glass coverslips and maintained in 4:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/medium 199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) (20Iwaki K.

Ventricular myocytes, cultured overnight, were washed and incubated in serum-containing medium 2–4 h prior to transfections. Cells were cotransfected for 18 h with a total of 8–12 μg of DNA (ANF/luciferase reporter gene along with vector alone or vector encoding various CaM kinase II isoforms) using a modified calcium-phosphate technique (23Shubeita H.E.

Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured and normalized to total protein as described (23Shubeita H.E. Martinson E.A. Van Bilsen M. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunofluorescence studies were performed on myocytes cultured on laminin-coated chamber slides for 24 h in serum-containing medium and subsequently serum-starved for 36–48 h (26Ramirez M.T. Post G.R. Sulakhe P.V. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8446-8451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. To examine endogenous ANF protein immunoreactivity, cells were incubated with a polyclonal anti-ANF antibody (Peninsula Labs, Belmont, CA) followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to examine myofilament organization. To study the localization of different CaM kinase II isoforms, myocytes were transfected with vector alone or vector encoding HA-tagged δB-CaM kinase II plus or minus other isoforms as described above and stained with a mouse anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Boehringer Mannheim) followed by a rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. For examining changes in ANF expression in myocytes transfected with CaM kinase II, cells were cotransfected with an RSV/luciferase gene together with CaM kinase II. Transfected cells were identified by immunostaining with a rabbit anti-luciferase antibody (Cortex Biochem) followed by a fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. ANF protein was detected using a mouse anti-ANF antibody (provided by Dr. C. Glembotski, San Diego State University) and a rhodamine-conjugated, goat anti-mouse antibody. Immunofluorescence was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a Plan-neofluar 40× objective (Zeiss). Myocytes were transfected as described above with 2–6 μg of vector encoding either HA-tagged α-, δB-, or δC-CaM kinase II. After 48 h cells were lysed in TBS containing 3 mmEDTA, 3 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Boehringer Mannheim) and ECL (Amersham) chemiluminescent detection. Activation of α1-AdrR in cultured ventricular myocytes leads to increases in cell size, myofilament organization, and ANF expression. To determine whether CaM kinase II is a mediator of these hypertrophic responses, we examined the effect of KN-93, an inhibitor of CaM kinase II, and KN-92, its structurally similar but inactive analog (27Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070PubMed Google Scholar, 28Sumi M. Kiuchi K. Ishikawa T. Ishii A. Hagiwara M. Nagatsu T. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 968-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). α1-AdrR activation with phenylephrine (PE) led to a marked increase in the percent of cells staining positive for ANF protein (Fig.1 A), ANF-luciferase expression (Fig. 1 B), and myofilament organization (Fig.1 C). These responses were all significantly attenuated by pretreatment with KN-93 but not with equimolar concentrations of KN-92, suggesting a requirement for CaM kinase II in α1-AdrR-induced myocardial hypertrophy. To determine which isoforms of CaM kinase II might be involved in the hypertrophic response, we transiently expressed the α, δB, and δC isoforms of CaM kinase II and examined ANF-luciferase reporter gene expression. Expression of δB-CaM kinase II in neonatal ventricular myocytes increased ANF reporter gene expression 3–4-fold whereas the δC (Fig. 2 A) and α isoforms (data not shown) were ineffective. All three isoforms were expressed in ventricular myocytes, as demonstrated by transfecting cells with the HA-tagged δB-, δC-, or α-CaM kinase II expression vectors and comparing protein levels by Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2 B). Since the δB-CaM kinase II appeared to be expressed at a somewhat higher level than δC-CaM kinase II (using 2.4 μg of DNA), the concentration of the δC expression vector was increased 3-fold. Under these conditions δC-CaM kinase II was expressed at levels equivalent to those of δB-CaM kinase II (Fig. 2 B), but still failed to increase ANF-luciferase gene expression (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained with increasing amounts of the α isoform of CaM kinase II (data not shown). These findings suggest that the activation of cardiac gene expression by CaM kinase II is specific for the δB isoform. The ability of α1-AdrR agonist to synergize with the expressed δB-CaM kinase II was then examined. Myocytes were cotransfected with either empty vector (SRα) or δB-CaM kinase II along with the ANF reporter gene, as above. Cells were subsequently treated with a range of concentrations of PE (0–100 μm), and a dose-response curve for ANF-luciferase expression was generated (Fig.3 A). Overexpression of δB-CaM kinase II significantly increased the maximum response to PE (Fig. 3 A). To demonstrate that the potentiation was mediated by CaM kinase II, myocytes were pretreated with KN-93 or KN-92 for 1.5 h and then challenged with PE. KN-93 treatment inhibited the response to PE by ∼60%, as shown earlier, and markedly attenuated the synergistic effect of CaM kinase II on the response to PE whereas KN-92 was ineffective (Fig. 3 B). These data support the notion that δB-CaM kinase II can serve as a mediator of the hypertrophic response elicited by α1-AdrR activation. CaM kinase II is known to phosphorylate and activate SRF which binds to the SRE in target genes (29Misra R.P. Bonni A. Miranti C.K. Rivera V.M. Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25483-25493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sprenkle et al. (22Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) characterized a truncated ANF promoter (ANF134) sufficient for PE-inducible gene expression and demonstrated that an SRE at position −114 bound SRF and was required to mediate responses to PE (22Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because the contribution of this SRE to ANF expression is minimized in the ANF638 promoter, which contains multiple PE-sensitive regulatory elements, we utilized the truncated ANF promoter-luciferase reporter construct (ANF134) to test the requirement for an SRE in CaM kinase II action. Overexpression of δB-CaM kinase II increased PE-stimulated ANF-luciferase expression from the ANF134-luciferase reporter. In contrast the same promoter containing a disrupted SRF/SRE binding site (ANF134/C114-luciferase; Ref. 22Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) was not further activated by δB-CaM kinase II (Fig.4). The δB isoform of CaM kinase II contains a nuclear localization signal that is absent in both the δC and α isoforms. Accordingly heterologously expressed δB-CaM kinase II localizes to the nucleus in fibroblasts and cardiac myocytes whereas δC does not (19Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The CaM kinase II holoenzyme can be formed from either homomultimeric or heteromultimeric association of subunits (12Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 13Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). We asked whether δB-CaM kinase II could be prevented from entering the nucleus of ventricular myocytes, as shown for fibroblasts (18Edman C.F. Schulman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), by coexpression of the non-nuclear (δC or α) isoforms of CaM kinase II. Myocytes were transfected with the vector encoding hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged δB-CaM kinase II, either alone or along with the δC- or α-CaM kinase II expression vector. Localization of HA-tagged δB-CaM kinase II was subsequently determined and scored as either nuclear or cytosolic. Approximately 82% of myocytes expressing HA-tagged δB-CaM kinase II showed nuclear HA staining (Fig.5) while the remaining cells showed cytosolic staining. In contrast, when the δC or α isoform of CaM kinase II was coexpressed with HA-tagged δB-CaM kinase II fewer than 3% of the cells showed nuclear HA staining (Fig. 5), with the majority of the cells showing cytosolic staining. These observations indicate that localization of δB-CaM kinase II to the nucleus can be prevented by coexpression of non-nuclear isoforms of CaM kinase II in ventricular myocytes. Using this approach to alter the localization of δB-CaM kinase II, we then asked whether nuclear localization of CaM kinase II correlated with its ability to induce transcriptional activation of the ANF gene. Myocytes were cotransfected with the ANF reporter gene along with the δB-CaM kinase II expression vector alone or with a 2-fold higher concentration of the vector encoding the δC or α isoform. Loss of nuclear localization of δB-CaM kinase II (Fig. 5) was associated with its inability to activate ANF reporter gene expression (Fig.6 A), linking cellular localization of this enzyme to its functional effects. In addition to examining reporter gene activity, we used immunofluorescence to detect ANF staining in cells transfected with the δB-CaM kinase II expression vector alone or together with that encoding either δC- or α-CaM kinase II. To identify transfected cells, an RSV/luciferase reporter gene was coexpressed; cells which stained positive for luciferase were then scored for ANF immunoreactivity using a mouse anti-ANF antibody. The percent of cells exhibiting ANF immunoreactivity was 5 times higher in cells transfected with the δB-CaM kinase II expression vector than in cells transfected with vector alone (Fig.6 B). However, no increase in ANF staining was observed in cells transfected with δB-CaM kinase II together with either the δC or α-CaM kinase II expression vector. These data complement the ANF reporter gene experiments in demonstrating at the single cell level that nuclear localization of δB-CaM kinase II is required to induce ANF gene expression. Finally, as an additional means of testing the hypothesis that nuclear localization of CaM kinase II is associated with its ability to stimulate ANF gene expression, we transfected cells with cDNA encoding a chimeric form of α-CaM kinase II containing the nuclear localization signal of the δB isoform (αδB). This chimeric kinase significantly increased ANF reporter gene expression, although to a lesser degree than δB-CaM kinase II (Table I), further demonstrating a correlation between the nuclear localization of CaM kinase II and induction of ANF gene expression.Table IActivation of ANF gene expression by different isoforms of CaM kinase IISRαδBαδBαMean1.09.41-ap < 0.001.4.71-bp < 0.01.2.1S.E.0.051.20.80.3Neonatal ventricular myocytes were transiently transfected as described in Fig. 2 using empty vector (SRα), the δB or α isoforms, or a chimeric α-CaM kinase II (αδB) containing the nuclear localization sequence from δB-CaM kinase II.

Both δB and αδB isoforms significantly increased ANF gene expression whereas the α isoform did not. The data are the mean ± S.E. from 15–26 determinations. Protein kinases play an important role in regulating gene expression. However, information concerning the involvement of CaM kinase II and its various isoforms in gene expression is limited. Most published studies have focused on the α isoform of CaM kinase II and have demonstrated positive regulation of gene expression through a CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) (30Kapiloff M.S. Mathis J.M. Nelson C.A. Lin C.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 88: 3710-3714Google Scholar, 31Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This isoform has also been shown to play a role in activating the c-fos gene through the c-fos SRE, and perhaps also through an adjacent AP-1-like sequence (16Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Misra R.P. Bonni A. Miranti C.K. Rivera V.M. Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. J. Biol.

The ability of the γ isoform of CaM kinase II to regulate interleukin-2 gene expression is another published example of transcriptional regulation by CaM kinase II (33Nghiem P. Ollick T. Gardner P. Schulman H. Nature. 1994; 371: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Nothing is known regarding the regulatory effects of the δ isoform of CaM kinase II on gene expression. Earlier studies suggested a role for CaM kinase II in cardiac gene expression associated with hypertrophy (3Sei C.A. Irons C.E. Sprenkle A.B. McDonough P.M. Brown J.H. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15910-15916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1992; 263: C642-C652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies presented here using KN-93 demonstrated that both ANF gene expression and myofilament organization induced by PE could be blocked, indicating a role for CaM kinase II in mediating hypertrophic responses in this cell system. The discovery that the predominant CaM kinase II isoform in the heart is the δB isoform and that it contains a nuclear localization signal (18Edman C.F. Schulman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) prompted us to examine the role of this CaM kinase II isoform in cardiac gene expression. As shown here expression of δB-CaM kinase II leads to induction of an ANF reporter gene and to an increase in endogenous ANF protein. This indicates that CaM kinase II is sufficient to induce at least one of the well characterized responses associated with hypertrophy. In studies where cells transfected with CaM kinase II were identified, no increase in myofibrillar organization was observed (data not shown). Thus while myofilament organization appears to be CaM kinase-dependent, additional signals may be necessary for expression of this morphological change. That expression of wild-type (rather than constitutively activated) CaM kinase II can induce ANF expression suggests that the enzyme has activity at basal Ca2+ concentrations. This is not surprising since it has been shown that there is a significant degree of CaM kinase II activation levels in unstimulated cardiac myocytes (9Xiao R. Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Suzuki T. Lakatta E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9659-9663Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) 2M. T. Ramirez and J. H. Brown, unpublished data. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type α-CaM kinase II in neuronal cells can elicit neurite outgrowth, even at resting Ca2+ levels (15Goshima Y. Ohsako S. Yamauchi T. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 559-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that stimulation with PE gives an enhanced response when δB-CaM kinase II is expressed suggests that α1-AdrR activation leads to further activation of this enzyme. This synergistic interaction further supports a regulatory role for CaM kinase II in mediating the effect of α1-AdrR stimulation on ANF gene expression. In contrast to the effects of δB-CaM kinase, neither wild-type δC- nor α-CaM kinase II induced ANF gene expression. These functional differences indicate that the effects of CaM kinase II on cardiac gene expression are isoform-specific. The basis for the differential effects of the CaM kinase II isoforms on gene expression is not known. However, comparison of the sequences of the isoforms suggests that the specificity does not correlate with differences in the catalytic properties of the enzymes but could be attributed to differences in cellular localization since the δC and α lack a nuclear localization signal found in the δB isoform. More direct evidence for a correlation between cellular localization and function comes from experiments in which nuclear localization of δB-CaM kinase II was altered by coexpression of δC or α isoforms. It has been shown in fibroblasts that a nuclear form of CaM kinase II can be excluded from the nucleus when coexpressed with non-nuclear forms (19Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, no functional correlate of this altered cellular localization has been shown. We show here that in ventricular myocytes δB-CaM kinase II can also be prevented from localizing to the nucleus when coexpressed with either the δC or α isoforms. Under these conditions, δB-CaM kinase II does not activate the ANF reporter gene or endogenous ANF protein expression. Further evidence for the importance of cellular localization comes from studies using a chimeric α-CaM kinase II containing the δB nuclear localization signal (αδB) and showing that it significantly increases ANF gene expression. The finding that CaM kinase II can activate the ANF reporter gene only when targeted to the nucleus demonstrates the correlation of localization with the functional effect of CaM kinase II. The signaling pathways through which CaM kinase II induces ANF gene expression remain to be elucidated. In PC12 cells, activation of CaM kinase II by depolarization leads to phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor SRF at Ser-103, which increases the ability of the SRF to associate with the SRE in the c-fos promoter and possibly to transactivate this gene (29Misra R.P. Bonni A. Miranti C.K. Rivera V.M. Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25483-25493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34MacNichol M. Jefferson A.B. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18055-18058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of constitutively activated α-CaM kinase II transactivates the c-fos promoter through both SRE and AP-1-like sequences (16Wang Y. Simonson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5915-5923Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability of PE to induce ANF expression in ventricular myocytes appears to require multiple response elements which include SRE and SP-1-like sequences located in the 638-base pair ANF promoter (22Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The SRE at position −114 has been shown to bind to SRF, and mutation of this site in the truncated ANF promoter (ANF134) disrupts SRF binding and PE-inducible ANF expression (22Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that this site is also required for δB CaM kinase II to activate the ANF134-luciferase gene expression. Thus, δB-CaM kinase II can regulate ANF gene expression at least in part through the proximal SRE in the ANF promoter. While further studies are required to define the mechanism of transcriptional activation by CaM kinase II in this system, our findings show for the first time that the δ isoform of CaM kinase II, which is the predominate isoform in the heart, can regulate gene expression. These studies further demonstrate that transactivation of the ANF gene is specific for the δB isoform of CaM kinase II, correlating the nuclear localization of this isoform with a genetic function. We thank David Goldstein for excellent technical assistance, Amy Sprenkle and Christopher Glembotski for providing the ANF134-luciferase and ANF134/C114-luciferase reporter genes, and Mallika Srinivasan for providing the epitope-tagged and chimeric CaM kinase constructs."

In the chicken's basilar papilla, we found numerous isoforms of KCa channels generated by alternative mRNA splicing at seven sites in a single gene, cSlo. In situ polymerase chain reactions demonstrated cSlo expression in hair cells and revealed differential distributions of KCa channel isoforms along the basilar papilla. Analysis of single hair cells by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the differential expression of channel variants. Heterologously expressed cSlo variants differed in their sensitivities to Ca2+ and voltage, suggesting that the distinct spatial distributions of cSlo variants help determine the tonotopic map."

https://openalex.org/W2033694332,"Cholinergic interneurons have been implicated in striatally mediated associative learning. In classical conditioning paradigms, conditioned stimuli trigger a transient suppression of neuronal activity that is dependent upon an intact dopaminergic innervation. Our hypothesis was that this suppression reflected dopaminergic enhancement of sensory-linked GABAergic input. As a test, the impact of dopamine on interneuronal GABA(A) receptor function was studied by combined patch-clamp recording and single-cell reverse transcription PCR. Activation of D5 dopamine receptors reversibly enhanced a Zn2+-sensitive component of GABA(A) currents. Although dependent upon protein kinase A (PKA) activation, the modulation was blocked by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) inhibition, suggesting it was dependent upon dephosphorylation. These results establish a novel mechanism by which intrastriatally released dopamine mediates changes in GABAergic signaling that could underlie the initial stages of associative learning."
https://openalex.org/W2058615127,"Summary We have cloned from the receptor epithelium of the chick cochlea a family of alternatively spliced cDNAs derived from cslo, which encodes a Ca2+-activated K+ channel like those shown to help determine the resonant frequency of electrically tuned hair cells. Our results from PCRs using template RNAs from both tonotopically subdivided receptor epithelia and single hair cells demonstrate differential exon usage along the frequency axis of the epithelium at multiple splice sites in cslo. We also show that single hair cells express more than one splice variant at a given splice site. Since channel isoforms encoded by differentially spliced slo transcripts in other species are functionally heterogeneous, these data suggest that differential processing of slo transcripts may account, at least in part, for the systematic variation in hair-cell membrane properties along the frequency axis of electrically tuned auditory receptor epithelia."

The potential role of the RNA hairpin structure in the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy is discussed. Eleven human diseases associated with the expansion of trinucleotide repeats have been identified so far. The progress of research in this new area has been discussed in several recent reviews (1Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2875-2878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 2Harris S. Moncrieff C. Johnson K. Hum. Mol.

One of these diseases is myotonic dystrophy (dystrophia myotonica (DM)), 1The abbreviations used are: DM, myotonic dystrophy (dystrophia myotonica); DMPK, myotonic dystrophy protein kinase; 3′-UTR, 3′-untranslated region. the most prevalent form of muscular dystrophy in adults with a global incidence of 1 in 8000. The molecular basis of this multisystemic disease, with a complex clinical picture, is the expanded CTG repeat in the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The repeat expansions, which cause DM, range from 50 repeats in mildly affected patients to >2000 repeats in the most severe congenital cases (6Brook J.D. McCurrach M.E. Harley H.G. Buckler A.J.

Science. 1992; 255: 1256-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the nature of the underlying DM mutation has been known for the past 6 years, the molecular pathology of this disease is not understood. In particular, it has been difficult to find the molecular mechanism by which this specific mutation, located in the 3′-UTR of the DMPK gene, causes the dominantly inherited disease. One of several recent proposals links the inheritance pattern with the molecular effects observed at the RNA level. It takes advantage of the observation that dramatic decreases in both mutant and normal DMPK poly(A)+ RNAs, as compared with the primary transcripts, occur in the DM tissue (9Wang J. Pegoraro E. Menegazzo E. Gennarelli M. Hoop R.C. Angelini C. Hoffman E.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This suggests that the expanded CUG repeat may have a dominant effect either on the processing of both the normal and expanded transcripts or on their transport to the cytoplasm. Other authors observed only a decrease in the expanded poly(A)+transcript (10Krahe R. Ashizawa T. Abbruzzese C. Roeder E. Carango P. Giacanelli M. Funanage V.L. Siciliano M.J. Genomics. 1995; 28: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The specific (CUG) n -binding proteins, discovered recently (11Timchenko L.T. Miller J.W. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V.

Commun. 1996; 228: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), may be involved in normal DMPK RNA processing, transport, and/or translation. These RNA-protein interactions may be impaired by the expanded DMPK transcript. Understanding the molecular basis of the DM disease is hampered by the lack of knowledge of the RNA structure formed by the CUG repeats. To fill this gap and to provide a background for further studies on the role of RNA level effects in the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy, we have analyzed the structure of the repeat region of DMPK RNA. In this paper, we describe the properties of an unusual “slippery” RNA hairpin that contains a metastable stem. The stability of the hairpin increases with the repeat length, and we postulate that long stable hairpins are important factors in DM pathogenesis. A plasmid containing 49 CTG repeats was obtained from Robert D. Wells. The alleles of the human DMPK gene containing 5, 11, and 21 CTG repeats were selected from our laboratory genomic DNA collection. Control DNA samples from healthy individuals were screened by the polymerase chain reaction with primers described earlier (8Fu Y.-H. Pizzuti A. Fenwick Jr., R.G. King J. Rajnarayan S. Dunne P.W. Dubel J. Nasser G.A. Ashizawa T. de Jong P. Wieringa B. Korneluk R. Perryman M.B. Epstein H.F. Caskey C.T. Science. 1992; 255: 1256-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The length of radiolabeled polymerase chain reaction products was compared with the M13 sequencing ladder on a polyacrylamide gel to determine the number of CTG repeats present. Bands corresponding to the selected alleles were cut out from the gel, eluted with 200 μl of H2O, reamplified, and sequenced using the cycle sequencing protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). The polymerase chain reaction products with confirmed nucleotide sequence were reamplified with the same reverse primer and a modified forward primer containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTCGAAGGGTCCTTGTAGCCGGGA. All amplifications and reamplifications were done under the same conditions: total volume of 5 μl, 3 pmol of each primer, 200 μm each dNTP, and 0.125 units of AmpliTaq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 57 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s. The transcription reaction was performed as described earlier (14Michal/owski D. Wrzesinski J. Krzyz˙osiak W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10727-10734Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in the presence of 1000 units/ml RNazin (Promega). The reaction was stopped by a phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Transcripts were then purified on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. The RNA bands corresponding to full-size transcripts were identified by staining with Stains-all (Serva), excised, eluted from the gel (with 0.3 m potassium acetate (pH 5.1), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS), and precipitated with ethanol. They were stored at −80 °C under ethanol before use. In vitro transcripts were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.). The labeled RNAs were purified by electrophoresis on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel, localized on the gel by autoradiography, and recovered as described above. As revealed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions, (CUG)5, (CUG)11, (CUG)21, and (CUG)49 migrate as monomeric species under conditions used for structure probing experiments. Prior to structure probing reactions, the labeled transcripts were supplemented with an unlabeled RNA carrier to obtain a final RNA concentration of 8 μm. Limited digestions with lead ions and S1and T1 nucleases (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were carried out in the buffer and under the conditions specified in the legend to Fig.1. All reactions were stopped by adding 7 m urea and 20 mm EDTA. Thermal melting of RNA hairpins monitored by the Pb(II)-induced cleavage was performed in the same buffer and salt conditions as described for structure probing experiments conducted at a temperature of 20 °C. The concentration of lead ions was a constant 0.5 mm. The reaction temperature and incubation time are specified in the legend to Fig. 2. Two components of the reaction mixture (the RNA solution and the lead acetate solution) present in separate tubes were preheated for 1 min in the DNA Thermal Cycler model 480 (Perkin–Elmer) to reach the desired temperature. Then equal volumes (5 μl) of the RNA solution and the lead solution were mixed together and allowed to react for the specified period of time. All reactions were stopped as described above. To assign the cleavage sites, the products of lead-induced hydrolysis and nuclease digestion were electrophoresed along with the products of alkaline hydrolysis and limited T1 nuclease digestion of the same RNA molecule. The alkaline hydrolysis ladder was generated by incubation of the labeled RNA in formamide containing 0.5 mm MgCl2 at 100 °C for 15 min. Partial T1 nuclease digestion of RNAs was performed under semi-denaturing conditions (10 mmsodium citrate (pH 5.0) and 3.5 m urea) with 0.2 units of the enzyme. The reaction mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 15 min. The products of lead cleavages and nuclease digestions were subjected to short, medium, and long electrophoretic runs on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (6, 10, 12, or 15%) containing 7 murea to visualize different sections of the studied molecules at high resolution. Autoradiograms from the short runs only are shown in Figs.1, 2, 4, and 5. As the relative cleavage intensities were analyzed, much attention was paid to the standardization of autoradiography and gel electrophoresis conditions. Wherever possible, the reactions were carried out in parallel, and their products were analyzed on the same gel. All experiments were repeated several times.Figure 5Susceptibility of (CUG)5 and flanking sequences to lead cleavage and nuclease digestion: probe concentration dependence.

This program is designed to determine optimal and suboptimal secondary structures for RNA molecules and contains free energy contributions for various secondary structure motifs. The free energy calculations were done using Vienna RNA Package Version 1.1, which includes RNAfold and RNAheat used by the RNAdraw program for calculations. The number of CTG repeats in normal alleles of the DMPK gene varies between 5 and 37. In the Caucasian population, the great majority of chromosomes show three ranges of the repeat size (15Watkins W.S. Bamshad M. Jorde L.B Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1485-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The most frequent allele contains five repeats; the next between 10 and 15; and the third from 20 to 37 repeats. The third group gives rise to the expanded pathogenic alleles (16Neville C.E. Mahadevan M.S. Barceló J.M. Korneluk R.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).

Rigid double-stranded RNA structures and single-stranded regions involved in strong stacking or hydrogen bond interactions are not cleaved. Flexible single-stranded regions are susceptible to cleavages as a mechanism of the reaction, which begins with the activation of the ribose 2′-OH group by the lead ion hydrate, and the attack of the 2′-O− nucleophile on the adjacent phosphate P atom requires a conformational change of the sugar phosphate backbone (17Brown R.S. Dewan J.C. Klug A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4785-4801Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 24Scott W.G. Klug A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 220-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The structure and sequence specificity of S1 and T1 nucleases is well established (25Knapp G. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 192-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Lead ions and nucleases have been widely used in the structural analysis of a variety of natural RNA molecules and their variants obtained by transcription in vitro. Here they are used for the first time in the analysis of RNA structures, formed by the same trinucleotide motif repeated many times. This gives the unique opportunity to assess the structure specificity of the probing reagents, which is not affected by the ambiguities caused by irregular variations of the nucleotide sequence. All RNA structure probing reactions described in this study were carried out under very similar solution conditions, and important conclusions were based on comparisons of the results obtained with different model substrates and structure probes. All three probes give similar patterns of hydrolysis in the repeat region of the DMPK mRNA fragment containing 49 CUG repeats (Fig.1). The strong cuts induced by the lead ions, S1 nuclease, and T1 ribonuclease are observed in the central part of the repeated sequence. Repeats at both the 5′- and 3′-sides of the highly reactive region are not digested by the nucleases and are very poorly cleaved by lead ions (Figs. 1 and2 a). Several 3′-terminal repeats and the first two repeats from the 5′-side are cleaved by lead ions more easily. This pattern of hydrolysis seems consistent with the presence of a hairpin structure that contains a large terminal loop spanning at least four repeats and, in agreement with the results of lead cleavages, a stem “breathing” at its base. This model, however, does not explain the observed asymmetry in the number of lead cleavages induced at both termini of the repeated sequence (Figs. 1 and2 a). A more likely explanation of these results is the presence of several alternatively aligned variants of the (CUG)49 hairpin in which different combinations of the neighboring central repeats are involved in the formation of smaller loops, and different terminal repeats form protruding ends at the base of the stem. In favor of this alternatively aligned, slippery RNA model are the following facts. 1) Both the enzymatic and lead-induced cuts in the hairpin loop tend to expand more toward the 5′-end of the repeated sequence from the central, most reactive 25th repeat. 2) More repeats located at the 3′-end of the repeated sequence show enhanced reactivity with lead ions. 3) Computer modeling (26Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar) of the (CUG)49structure predicts the loops of four or seven nucleotides as the most energetically favorable. The fact that only the lead ions, but not the nucleases, cleave the protruding terminal repeats is not surprising. These single-stranded repeats, adjacent to the hairpin stem, are very likely inaccessible to the S1 and T1 nucleases. The proposed structures of the alternatively aligned hairpins formed by (CUG)49 are shown in Fig.3. The characteristic feature of the (CUG)49 hairpin stem is its metastability. Melting of this structure monitored by lead cleavages is revealed by the disappearance of more intense loop cuts and by the increase of cleavage intensity in the stem (Fig.2 a). The loop cuts become weaker at the temperature 65 °C and are only slightly stronger than the background cleavages at 75 °C, at which also the stem cuts remain weak. On the other hand, a dramatic increase in the intensity of the stem cuts is observed at 85 °C. These observations could be explained by the formation of an intermediate structure from the hairpin to the highly reactive single-stranded form, e.g. an intermolecular duplex formed by the antiparallel single strands held together by interactions similar to those present in the hairpin stem. At a low temperature, all weak cuts in the stem are of nearly equal intensity, with only a minor preference for cleavages at UpG (Fig.2 a). This preference tends to disappear at a temperature above 45 °C. Therefore, this stem should not be considered as composed of units in which two base pairs, C-G and G-C, are followed by the internal loop, formed by the U·U mispair. In light of our data, the stem structure seems to be better described as a well balanced system, a result of a compromise between the stabilizing effects of the G-C and C-G interactions and the destabilizing effect of the U·U interactions. For this reason, all base-base interactions present in the hairpin stem are shown by dots in Fig. 3 to indicate their specific nature, which results in the decreased stability of the stem structure. Slippery hairpins are also present in DMPK mRNA fragments containing 21 and 11 CUG repeats. Here again, several terminal repeats that form protruding ends at the base of the stem show enhanced reactivity. Highly reactive are the centrally located repeats that form a loop. The loops include repeats 9–12 in hairpin variants of (CUG)21 and repeats 4–6 in the (CUG)11hairpins. A major difference among the (CUG)11, (CUG)21, and (CUG)49 hairpins is the rigidity of their stem structure. This is clearly seen as a difference in the intensity of lead-induced cleavages in their loops and stems (compare Figs. 1 and 4). The stem cuts in (CUG)11 are the strongest, whereas those in (CUG)21 are more efficient than those in (CUG)49. Probably both the extended stacking interactions and the increased number of hydrogen bond interactions contribute to the higher rigidity of the sugar phosphate backbone in longer hairpins. A difference is also apparent when the intensities of lead-induced cleavages in (CUG)21 are compared with those of S1 nuclease cuts in the same model molecule. The S1 nuclease is not capable of detecting the higher degree of stem structure relaxation in (CUG)21, and only very weak S1 nuclease cuts can be detected after extended autoradiography (data not shown). However, in (CUG)11, where the relaxation of the stem structure is still more profound and the lead cleavages become fairly strong, the S1 nuclease cleaves the stem poorly, with a preference for CpU > GpC. The same preference is observed among the strong S1 nuclease cuts within the hairpin loop. The preference of the lead cleavages generated in the stem is different. In (CUG)11, the order of reactivity is CpU > UpG > GpC. In the more stable stems of (CUG)21 and (CUG)49, this cleavage specificity changes to UpG > CpU > GpC (Figs. 2 and 4). Melting experiments, similar to this shown in Fig. 2 a for (CUG)49, indicate that hairpins formed by (CUG)21 (data not shown) and (CUG)11 (Fig.2 b) are significantly less stable. The (CUG)11hairpin melts completely at ∼55 °C, whereas the (CUG)21 hairpin melts completely at ∼65 °C. The repeat region of (CUG)5 is cleaved by lead ions with the order of reactivity CpU > UpG > GpC, which is characteristic for the single-stranded looped repeats in all hairpin-forming repeats analyzed here and for stem cuts in the least stable hairpin, (CUG)11. In sequences flanking the (CUG)5 repeat, all G nucleotides are good targets for T1 ribonuclease, and only a few sites are resistant to both S1 nuclease and lead ions (Fig.5). This means that the flanking sequences are mostly if not entirely single-stranded. It should also be pointed out that the pattern of reactivity of both short sequences flanking the CUG repeats is practically identical in all model molecules analyzed in this study. This indicates that independent of the length of the repeated sequence (5, 11, 21, or 49 units), the 30 nucleotides at their 5′-end and the 35 nucleotides at their 3′-end all form the same structural environment for the repeats. The molecular mechanism of trinucleotide repeat genetic instability could be explained by the hairpins formed by DNA during replication (27Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In several recent biophysical studies, the presence of hairpin structures was confirmed in (CTG) n oligomers (28Gacy A.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the existence of similar RNA structures was postulated (30Mitas M. Yu A. Dill J. Kamp T.J. Chambers E.J. Haworth I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1050-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Santhana Mariappan S.V. Garcia A.E. Gupta G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that the (CUG) n hairpins indeed exist in the DMPK RNA fragments and that the stability of these structures increases with the repeat length. We conclude that the entire hairpin stem forms a novel relaxed type of duplex structure, rather than a mosaic of the C-G and G-C base pairs interrupted by the U·U mispairs. The results of the lead cleavage experiments show that all internucleotide bonds in the stems of (CUG)49 and (CUG)21 undergo mild cleavages, which are much weaker than those that occur in the terminal loops and in the single-stranded CUG repeats. Also, the order of reactivity of internucleotide bonds within the repeated sequence is different in different model molecules and in their distinct structural motifs (Fig.6). The cleavages at CpU predominate in the single-stranded regions, whereas the cuts at UpG are the strongest among the weak cleavages in the stem. The stabilization of stem structure with the increased repeat length in (CUG)11, (CUG)21, and (CUG)49 is accompanied not only by the weakening of all cleavages within the stem, but also by the reversal in the order of internucleotide bond reactivity (from CpU > UpG to UpG > CpU). This implies that the rigidity of the phosphate residues present in CpU increases most dramatically in the stems of (CUG)49 and (CUG)21 as compared with that in the single-stranded structure. Also, the phosphate residues present at the 3′-side of each U nucleotide remain the most flexible in the metastable stem. At an elevated temperature (above 45 °C), the stem structure seems to convert to another form, in which the intensity of the UpG cleavages becomes similar to that of the CpU and GpC cleavages (Fig. 6, structure 3). Thus, at higher temperature, the sugar phosphate backbone of the interacting U·U, C-G, and G-C residues shows approximately the same degree of flexibility. Our results do not reveal the nature of the U·U interactions, which make the stem structure metastable. Earlier biophysical studies showed that tandem U·U mismatches in short RNA duplexes are unexpectedly stable (33SantaLucia J. Kierzek R. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8242-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recent crystallographic studies of two different model oligoribonucleotides (34Wahl M.C. Rao S.T. Sundaralingam M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 35Baeyens K.J. De Bondt H.L. Holbrook S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and NMR studies of a conserved ribosomal RNA hairpin (36Wang Y.-X. Huang S. Draper D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2666-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) give some details about possible U·U pairing schemes. Of the crystal structures, that of the r(UUCGCG) oligomer (34Wahl M.C. Rao S.T. Sundaralingam M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) seems to be more relevant to the (CUG) n hairpin. This hexamer forms a duplex in which two U·U pairs are formed adjacent to the base-paired CGCG system. The latter could be considered a model for the (CUG) n hairpin stem deprived of the intervening U·U pair. Very interestingly, the two U·U pairs adopt an unusualtrans-arrangement about their glycosidic bonds. This U·U pairing occurs through the Watson-Crick face of one U nucleotide and the Hoogsteen face of the other. On the other hand, in the crystal structure of the dodecamer r(GGACUUUGGUCC), which also forms a duplex structure, the U·U pairs are in the standardcis-arrangement and form wobble U·U pairing (35Baeyens K.J. De Bondt H.L. Holbrook S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The NMR study of a single U·U mismatch within an asymmetrical, biologically relevant context also showed that the mismatch is base-paired (36Wang Y.-X. Huang S. Draper D.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2666-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It forms the NH-3–O-4 hydrogen bond, which forces one of the two U nucleotides to adopt an extended trans-conformation of the backbone to accommodate the mismatch. It has been postulated that the U·U pairs, which are exceptionally flexible, can interconvert between different pairing modes. They could also be the loci for the fraying of the double helix (34Wahl M.C. Rao S.T. Sundaralingam M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, in the model hexamer, the CGCG blocks appear largely unperturbed and rigid within the A form of RNA structure (34Wahl M.C. Rao S.T. Sundaralingam M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We show here that the presence of the U·U pair after every two pairs of C-G and G-C in the (CUG) n hairpins perturbs their stem structure. According to our data, the entire (CUG) n hairpin stem is a relaxed metastable structure, and the postulated interconvertion between different U·U pairing modes could be reflected by the distinct lead cleavage patterns (2Harris S. Moncrieff C. Johnson K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sutherland G.R. Richards R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3636-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) observed in the stem (Fig. 6). From the perspective of RNA structure probing methods, our results show a high performance of lead-induced cleavages in determining the morphology of the previously unknown RNA structure. The lead cleavage reaction, as easy to handle as the nuclease digestion, has this advantage over the enzymes: that active species (the deprotonated lead ion hydrates (18Brown R.S. Hingerty B.E. Dewan J.C. Klug A. Nature. 1983; 303: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar)) are much smaller and can penetrate folded RNA structures easier. The hairpin formed by the repeated sequence turned out to be an excellent model to show a clear picture of the structure specificity of the probing reagents. Repeats involved in structures of different types or of different strengths give distinct lead cleavage patterns and/or cleavage intensity. If we assume that the problem of the DM pathogenesis can be explained by the post-transcriptional RNA level effects and that the hairpins described here exist also in vivo, we can ask the following question. What is the special property of the transcript with 50 or more CUG repeats that could not be shown by transcripts containing 37 repeats or less? Two differences in the structure of the normal and expanded transcripts are obvious; one is the CUG hairpin length and the other is its stability. How could these factors possibly affect the post-transcriptional activities? The CUG repeat is located in the 3′-UTR of DMPK mRNA, which is coded by the last exon (exon 15) of the gene (37Mahadevan M.S. Amemiya C. Jansen G. Sabourin L. Baird S. Neville C.E. Wormskamp N. Segers B. Batzer M. Lamerdin J. de Jong P. Wieringa B. Korneluk R.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The repeat is 223 nucleotides from the translation stop codon and 485 nucleotides from the polyadenylation site (6Brook J.D. McCurrach M.E. Harley H.G. Buckler A.J. Church D. Aburatani H. Hunter K. Stanton V.P. Thirion J.P. Hudson T. Sohn R. Zemelman B. Snell R.G. Rundle S.A. Crow S. Davies J. Shelbourne P. Buxton J. Jones C. Juvonen V. Johnson K. Harper P.S. Shaw D.J. Housman D.E. Cell. 1992; 68: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). A secondary structure model of this portion of the DMPK RNA containing 120 CUG repeats is shown in Fig.7. In the GC-rich (64%) 3′-UTR, the CUG hairpin can impose structural perturbations over a long distance. This could include the polyadenylation site, the splice sites, and the coding sequence. It is also worth noting that in the case of long repeats, the computer program (26Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar) draws either a single long hairpin or two or more shorter hairpin structures with practically unchanged calculated free energy. It remains to be determined experimentally whether or not such multiple hairpins in fact exist in transcripts from the highly expanded alleles. As far as the specific proteins that bind to the CUG repeats is concerned, it remains to be seen whether these proteins bind preferentially to the single-stranded or double-stranded repeated motifs. Usually, the loop sequences in RNA hairpins define the binding site for RNA-binding proteins, whereas the stem may help to correctly position the protein by sequence-independent contacts with the backbone (38Varani G. Pardi A. RNA-Protein Interactions. 1st Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 1-24Google Scholar). In (CUG) n hairpins, the problem is less clear, as both the loop and the stem contain the same repeated sequence motif. The specific CUG-binding proteins have been isolated based on their affinity for (CUG)8 (11Timchenko L.T. Miller J.W. Timchenko N.A. DeVore D.R. Datar K.V. Lin L. Roberts R. Caskey C.T. Swanson M.S.

Genet. 1996; 5: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and (CUG)10 (13Bhagwati S. Ghatpande A. Leung B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which, in light of our results, do not form stable hairpins. In case the proteins bind to the single-stranded regions, the long hairpins would not titrate them more effectively than the short hairpins unless there are multiple hairpins or the stability of the stem structure makes a significant contribution to the protein binding efficiency. If the proteins bind to the double-stranded repeats, their titration by the long CUG hairpins could be more easily explained. Having the CUG hairpin structure determined in vitro, experiments can now be designed to demonstrate that the hairpins exist in vivo, to establish the way they bind the proteins, and to show how the protein binding changes with the repeat expansions.

Here, we analyzed developmental regulation in zebra finches of zenk, an immediate-early gene (IEG) implicated in memory consolidation. Basal expression was elevated within auditory telencephalon (specifically, within the caudomedial neostriatum [NCM]) during song acquisition. Expression could be further induced by song playbacks 30 days after hatching but not at 20 days nor in juveniles reared in severe isolation. Singing itself induced zenk in song production nuclei, including Area X, even in adults. Within a compartment of the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), however, this response dwindled as singing matured. These results suggest that the onset of sensory memory storage may be regulated in part at NCM, and motor plasticity may be regulated at RA."

To visualize this process, GFP-tagged preproatrial natriuretic factor (ANF) was expressed in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells. Biochemical and microfluorimetric experiments demonstrate that proANF-EGFP is packaged in granules that accumulate at neurite endings and is released in a Ca2+-dependent manner by secretagogs. Confocal microscopy shows that secretion is associated with depletion of granules distributed throughout the terminal. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and time-lapse particle tracking reveal that only a subpopulation of cytoplasmic secretory granules, similar in size to the releasable pool, can move quickly enough (D = 6 x 10(-11) cm2/s) to support release. Therefore, sustained secretory responses are limited by the number of mobile granules and their slow rate of diffusion."

Recent studies have raised the possibility that autologous serum proteins might bind PS-expressing cells. Indeed, evidence has been presented suggesting that at least one of these proteins, β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI), could play a critical role in regulating platelet-dependent thrombosis (12Brighton T.A.

Evidence is accumulating which suggests that the majority of so-called antiphospholipid antibodies present in the serum of patients with a variety of autoimmune disorders are in fact directed to plasma proteins (β2GPI, prothrombin, and protein C) that bind lipids (14Galli M. Comfurius P. Maassen C. Hemker H.C. De Baets M.H. van Breda-Vriesman Barbui T. Zwaal R.F.A. Bevers E.M. Lancet. 1990; 335: 1544-1547Abstract PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 15McNeil H.P.

Interestingly, while deep venous thrombosis is characteristic of antiphospholipid syndrome, in vitro diagnostic tests of the serum of the patient exhibit prolonged clotting times. This apparent paradox suggests that the interaction of these complexesin vivo are complicated and may be mediated via Fc receptor-dependent binding to circulating cells. This report focuses on the potential role of β2GPI in the recognition and clearance of antibody-β2GPI-cell complexes using PS-containing liposomes, red blood cell ghosts, and apoptotic thymocytes as models. Our findings support the notion that β2GPI can regulate the interaction of PS-expressing cells with macrophages. Phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). Methylprednisolone and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were from Sigma. Carrier-free125I-labeled PE was synthesized as described previously (19Schroit A.J. Madsen J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3617-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). β2GPI was purified from pooled human plasma (Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, Houston, TX) by perchloric acid precipitation, ion exchange chromatograhy, and heparin affinity chromatography as described previously (20Poltz E. Kostner G.M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Wurm H.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Human serum albumin (25% USP) was from Alpha Therapeutics (Los Angeles, CA). Antibodies were produced in rabbits by injecting ∼0.5 mg of purified β2GPI in complete Freund's adjuvant at multiple intradermal sites, followed by two boosters (0.25 mg of protein) at 2-week intervals in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The rabbits were bled 2 weeks after the last injection. IgG was purified from the immune serum by protein A affinity chromatography. Purified anti-β2GPI IgG was labeled with FITC using standard procedures (protein/FITC:1/4). Macrophages were obtained from the peritoneal cavity of female C3H mice 4 days after an intraperitoneal injection of 2 ml of thioglycollate broth. The cells were washed, resuspended in minimal essential medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, and plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar) (0.5 × 106 cells/well). Resealed, lipid symmetric red blood cell ghosts were prepared from 125I-labeled red blood cells (IODO-BEADs, Pierce) as described previously (22Connor J. Gillum K. Schroit A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1025: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thymocytes were obtained from BALB/c mice. Multilamellar vesicles (MLV) and small lipid vesicles containing 125I-PE (1 μCi/ml) were prepared from the indicated lipids (1 mg/ml) by vortexing and sonication, respectively. Flow cytometry was done with a Coulter Epics Profile flow cytometer employing EPICS elite software. The binding specificity of β2GPI to phospholipids was monitored by ELISA using lipid-coated polystyrene plates and by gel diffusion using small sonicated vesicles. Polystyrene ELISA plates were coated overnight with 6 μg of the indicated phospholipids (60 μg/ml in ethanol). The plates were then blocked with 1% ovalbumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 20 mm Tris, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4) for 60 min and incubated for 60 min (20 °C) with serial dilutions of β2GPI. After removing unbound β2GPI, the plates were incubated for an additional 60 min with 100 μl of anti-β2GPI (0.5 μg of IgG/well). The plates were then washed, and bound antibody was quantified with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. TMB-ELISA (3,3′-5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine base, Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as the substrate. In the gel diffusion, microscope slides were coated with 0.9% agarose in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to yield a punch hole volume of 20 μl. The center holes were filled with β2GPI (300 μg/ml) and the surrounding wells with small unilamellar vesicles of the indicated lipid composition. The plates were developed for 24 h, and unbound protein and lipid was removed by washing for 24 h in the same buffer. The gels were then dried. Precipitates containing protein and lipid were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue and autoradiography, respectively. Platelet-poor plasma was prepared by high speed centrifugation of human blood (collected from normal volunteers in acid citrate dextrose). Plasma was pretreated with Russel's viper venom (RVV) (50 μg/ml) for 2 h at 20 °C (Sigma). PC/PS (1/1) MLV (1 mg lipid/ml) were incubated with the indicated amounts of β2GPI or human serum albumin overnight. Clotting time was determined by continuously mixing MLV (20 μl), activated plasma (25 μl), and 25 mmCaCl2 (15 μl) with a 50-μl Eppendorf pipette until the suspension could no longer be aspirated. Control clotting times using protein-free PC/PS MLV was 23 s. PC MLV did not promote clotting. Red blood cells, red blood cell ghosts, or thymocytes were resuspended in TBS containing 1 mm EDTA (TBS-EDTA) and incubated with β2GPI (16 μg/ml) and fluorescent rabbit anti-β2GPI IgG (50 μg/ml) for 30 min at 20 °C. Unbound β2GPI and antibody were removed by washing. Labeled ghosts and cells were photographed usingepi-fluorescence illumination with appropriate excitation and emission filters. Thymocytes (5 × 107 cells/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium were incubated with 10 μm methylprednisolone (diluted from a 10 mm stock in Me2SO) at 37 °C. Control thymocytes were incubated with identical concentrations of Me2SO alone. At the indicated times, aliquots were stained with FITC-anti-β2GPI as described above and analyzed by flow cytometry. Forward and side angle light scatter were set to eliminate dead cells. Fluorescence channels were set logarithmically. 125I-Labeled liposomes, -red blood cells, -red blood cell ghosts, and 51Cr-labeled thymocytes were incubated with β2GPI and anti-β2GPI as described above. The macrophages were washed, resuspended in TBS, and incubated with the targets (vesicles or cells) for the indicated time. The cultures were then washed and uptake was determined by scintillation counting. Western blot analysis with antibodies produced against β2GPI reacted specifically with the antigen when tested against whole human serum (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and4). The high molecular weight band stained in whole serum (lane 3) is multimeric β2GPI because it did not stain with the anti-rabbit IgG alone and resolved to a 50-kDa band upon reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol (not shown). Several assays were developed to test the reactivity of the protein to phospholipids. Fig.2 shows the binding of soluble β2GPI to lipid-coated ELISA plates. It can be seen that the binding of β2GPI to negatively charged lipids could be detected at protein concentrations <10 ng/ml. Binding to PC and PE was weak.Figure 2Binding of β2GPI to phospholipids in a modified ELISA. Serial dilutions of β2GPI (from 500 ng/ml) were incubated with the indicated lipid-coated plates as described under “Experimental Procedures.” β2GPI not bound to the wells was removed by washing, and bound protein was quantitated with rabbit anti-β2GPI IgG. ▴, PC; ▾, PE; •, PS; ○, PG; ▪, CL; □, PA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequence analysis of β2GPI has shown that the protein likely contains a single phospholipid binding site (23Steinkasserer A. Estaller C. Weiss E.H. Sim R.B. Day A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 24Hunt J. Krilis S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that β2GPI-lipid interactions are monovalent. However, early studies have shown that β2GPI agglutinates mitochondria, suggesting a multivalent interaction (25Schousboe I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 396-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To test this, the ability of β2GPI to precipitate lipid vesicles in a gel diffusion assay was determined. Fig.3 shows β2GPI-dependent precipitation of vesicles containing increasing amounts of PS in PC (Fig. 3, A andB) and liposomes containing 50 mol% PS, PG, PA, and PE in PC (Fig. 3, C and D). Analysis of the precipitates by protein staining and autoradiography showed that the precipitates were composed of 125I-labeled lipids and protein, confirming that the precipitates were indeed the result of anionic lipid-β2GPI interactions. The effect of β2GPI on the procoagulant activity of PS-containing vesicles was determined by the RVV test. Fig.4 shows that increasing β2GPI concentrations resulted in corresponding increases in clotting times. Human serum albumin (used as a negative control) even at a concentration 50-fold higher than β2GPI was without effect. Thus, the binding of β2GPI to PS seems to compete for the assembly of the plasma coagulation factors on the vesicle surface. These results suggest that β2GPI can effectively “shield” the lipids polar head group from other lipid-protein (and lipid-cell) interactions. Because β2GPI binds PS-containing vesicles in vitro(21Wurm H.J. Int. J. Biochem. 1984; 16: 511-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 26Hagihara Y. Goto Y. Kato H. Yoshimura T. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and in vivo (13Chonn A. Semple S.C. Cullis P.R. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 25845-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and influences their clearance from the peripheral circulation (13Chonn A. Semple S.C. Cullis P.R. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 25845-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to assume that this protein might serve as a specific marker for the recognition of PS-expressing cells. To model PS-dependent phagocytosis, the influence of β2GPI on the uptake of PS-containing liposomes and PS-expressing lipid symmetric red blood cell ghosts was determined. The data presented in Fig. 5shows that macrophage uptake of PS-liposomes and β2GPI-treated PS liposomes were similar. On the other hand, the addition of β2GPI antibodies increased the uptake ∼2-fold. As expected, treatment of PC liposomes with β2GPI and β2GPI-antibody was without effect. Although these data seem to indicate little or no influence of β2GPI on the recognition of PS by macrophages, it is possible that the protein impedes charge-dependent lipid-macrophage interactions and directly influences macrophage recognition (see “Discussion”). Indeed, similar experiments showed increased uptake of β2GPI-treated lipid symmetric red blood cell ghosts (Fig. 6) but not asymmetric red blood cells (TableI), suggesting that β2GPI can, in some circumstances, enhance the interaction of PS-expressing targets with macrophages.Figure 6Uptake of lipid symmetric red blood cell ghosts by macrophages.

Open table in a new tab Lipid symmetric 125I-labeled red blood cell ghosts and lipid asymmetric 125I-labeled red blood cells were incubated with β2GPI, anti-β2GPI, or both as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Uptake was measured after 1 h of incubation with macrophage monolayers at 37 °C. Many studies have shown that the exposure of PS to the outer leaflet is one of the characteristic features of cells undergoing apoptosis (27Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Kuijten G.A.M. Keehnen R.M.J. Pals S.T. VanOers M.H.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because β2GPI is an anionic lipid-binding protein found in plasma, it is possible that it mediates the recognition and uptake of apoptotic cells. To test this, mouse thymocytes were induced to apoptose with corticosteroid, and the exposure of PS was quantified by FACS analysis of β2GPI and FITC-anti-β2GPI-treated cells. Fig.7 shows that cultures incubated with corticosteroid (Fig. 7 B), but not control cultures (Fig.7 A), developed a subpopulation of cells that stained with FITC-anti-β2GPI. As expected for steroid-induced apoptosis, the fluorescent cell population increased with increasing incubation time (Fig. 7 C). Examination of the cells by fluorescence microscopy showed aggregates of intensely fluorescent cells (Fig. 7, D and E); single non-aggregated cells were not fluorescent. To determine whether β2GPI influences the binding and uptake of these cells by macrophages,51Cr-labeled thymocytes were induced to apoptose, treated with β2GPI alone or β2GPI and anti-β2GPI, and monitored for uptake. Fig.8 A, shows that treatment of apoptotic thymocytes with β2GPI resulted in moderate enhancement in macrophage uptake (1.2 times). Similar to the results obtained with PS liposomes and red cell ghosts, cells treated with β2GPI and β2GPI antibodies exhibited >2-fold increase in binding. Fluorescent microscopy of macrophage cultures incubated with FITC-labeled apoptotic thymocytes (Fig. 8C) showed macrophages with either bound and/or phagocytosed fluorescent thymocytes.Figure 8Uptake of β2GPI-treated thymocytes by macrophages. 51Cr-labeled thymocytes were incubated with macrophage cultures for 1 h at 37 °C.

If binding were monovalent, precipitation would not occur. Conceivably, these interactions could be formed by lipid-β2GPI binding ratios of >1 or by lipid-dependent β2GPI aggregation. The combined observations that both domains I (26Hagihara Y. Goto Y. Kato H. Yoshimura T. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and V (24Hunt J. Krilis S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 653-659PubMed Google Scholar) of β2GPI bind phospholipid independent of each other suggest that multivalent interactions are indeed possible. Although the in vivo function of β2GPI has not been investigated in detail, it is known to strongly interact with plasma proteins (20Poltz E. Kostner G.M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and play a role in regulating coagulation (12Brighton T.A. Hogg P.J. Dai Y.-P. Murray B.H. Choing B.H. Chesterman C.N. Br. J. Haematol. 1996; 93: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and immune clearance (13Chonn A. Semple S.C. Cullis P.R. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 25845-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that intravenously injected liposomes containing negatively charged phospholipids rapidly bind β2GPI, a result that directly correlated with the clearance rates of the vesicles. (13Chonn A. Semple S.C. Cullis P.R. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 25845-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the interaction of β2GPI with PS-expressing liposomes, red blood cell ghosts, and cells and determined their propensity to interact with macrophages. Because β2GPI inhibits PS-dependent clotting (Fig. 4 and Ref. 28Nimpf J. Bevers E.M. Bomans P.H.H. Till U. Wurm H. Kostner G.M. Zwaal R.F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 884: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), it is likely that its binding to anionic surfaces sterically impedes the binding of other charge-dependent lipid-binding proteins. Assuming this to be the case, β2GPI would be expected to inhibit the uptake of anionic lipid vesicles by macrophages. The observation that vesicle uptake was maintained, or even enhanced in the case of PS-expressing red blood cell ghosts, suggests that uptake mechanisms, other than those dependent on direct PS-macrophage interactions, exist. These results raise the possibility that the pathophysiologic expression of PS on cells leads to β2GPI-binding that influences the cells interaction with its environment. Because apoptosis involves the reorientation of lipids in the cells plasma membrane that results in the surface expression of PS (27Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Kuijten G.A.M. Keehnen R.M.J. Pals S.T. VanOers M.H.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we induced apoptosis in thymocytes and determined (i) if β2GPI binds to PS-expressing apoptotic cells and (ii) the influence of bound β2GPI to the recognition of these cells by macrophages. Upon steroid-induced apoptosis, an increasing fraction of the cells bound fluorescent β2GPI antibodies (Fig. 7), indicating increased expression of β2GPI binding sites at the cell surface. Apoptotic cells treated with β2GPI and antibody demonstrated enhanced uptake. Similar to PS liposomes, incubation of apoptotic cells with β2GPI alone did not enhance macrophage uptake. As discussed above, this could also be the result of β2GPI-dependent inhibition of β2GPI-independent PS recognition pathways. The results presented here combined with those on the β2GPI-dependent clearance of negatively charged liposomes (13Chonn A. Semple S.C. Cullis P.R. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 25845-25849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) suggest that β2GPI may be one of the determinants for the recognition of PS-expressing cells in vivo. When this interaction is further mediated by antibody, the binding affinity of β2GPI to its target lipid increases >30-fold (29Willems G.M. Janssen M.P. Pelsers M.A.L. Comfurius P. Galli M. Zwaal R.F.A. Bevers E.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13833-13842Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This suggests that antibody could significantly influence the interaction of PS-expressing cells with the environment. Indeed, there is a substantial amount of evidence indicating that antibodies to β2GPI and/or β2GPI-lipid complexes is the primary etiology of antiphospholipid syndrome (14Galli M. Comfurius P. Maassen C. Hemker H.C. De Baets M.H. van Breda-Vriesman Barbui T. Zwaal R.F.A. Bevers E.M. Lancet. 1990; 335: 1544-1547Abstract PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 15McNeil H.P. Simpson R.J.

Immunol. 1995; 154: 954-960PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that enhanced thrombosis in certain autoimmune disorders may be the result of cell aggregation and concomitant vascular occlusion by antibody-dependent binding of aggregates (similar to those seen in Figs. 6 and 7) to the vascular endothelium. A similar mechanism has been suggested for autoimmune responses against proteins that bind PE (31Sugi T. Mcintyre J.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 84: 97-109Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In summary, it would seem likely that β2GPI not only regulates thrombosis but is involved in the recognition and clearance of cells that fail to preserve membrane lipid asymmetry. This would include not only cells undergoing apoptosis but also related events such as activation of platelets and cell senescence. We thank C. Diaz for critical analysis and helpful discussions and Karen Ramirez for FACS analysis."

Here we report the characterization and identification of a 106-kDa nuclear protein as a specific substrate of PKC-ζ.

Likewise, addition of purified PKC-ζ, but neither PKC-α nor δ, to nuclear extracts resulted in an incremental increase in the phosphorylation of pp106.

Several signaling molecules and second messenger systems have been identified that participate in relaying signals from the NGF receptor to the nucleus, one of which is protein kinase C (PKC). PKC is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase which has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes (3Parker P.J. Kour G. Marais R. Mitchell F. Pears C. Schaap D. Stabel S.

Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar, 5Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). Based upon structural features the isoforms of the PKC family can be grouped into three related groups: classical/conventional, cPKCs (α, βI,II, and γ) that are sensitive to calcium/diacylglycerol and tumor promoting phorbol esters; novel/atypical (δ, ε, η, and θ) that are sensitive to diacylglycerol and phorbol esters but insensitive to calcium; and atypical aPKCs (ζ and ι/λ) that are insensitive to all three regulators, diacylglyerol, calcium, and phorbol esters (5Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). The precise role and placement of PKC within the NGF signaling cascade has been unclear and controversial. Upon treatment of PC12 cells with NGF, diacylglycerol, an endogenous PKC activator, is generated (6Chan B.L. Chao M.V. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1756-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) followed by PKC activation (7Hama T. Huang K.-P. Guroff G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 8Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 331-338PubMed Google Scholar). PKC activators, such as phorbol esters, mimic certain biological activities of NGF in PC12 cells (9McTigue M. Cremins J. Halegoua S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9047-9056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Greenberg M.E. Greene L.A. Ziff E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14101-14110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, NGF has been shown to stimulate translocation of PKC activity and activation of specific isoforms (11Kondratyev A.D. Popova O.N. Severin S.E. Choladze M.A. Shmyrev I.I. Tubasheva I.A. Zotova E.E. Posypanova G.A. Severin E.S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 264: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Soh Y. Ewald S.J. White K.R. Lloyd E.D. Olivier A. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Likewise, certain NGF-specific transcripts are induced in response to PKC (13Sigmund O. Naor Z. Anderson D.J. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2257-2261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A requirement for PKC as part of the induction pathway leading to NGF-stimulated neurite out growth has also been documented (14Hall F.L. Fernyhough P. Ishii D.N. Vulliet P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4460-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Altin J.G. Wetts R. Riabowol K.T. Bradshaw R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The PKC inhibitor sphingosine blocks NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (14Hall F.L. Fernyhough P. Ishii D.N. Vulliet P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4460-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and microinjection of PKC antibodies inhibits NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and c-fos expression (15Altin J.G. Wetts R. Riabowol K.T. Bradshaw R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, down-regulation or removal of cellular PKC pools by chronic treatment with phorbol esters has no effect on neurite outgrowth (16Reinhold D.S. Neet K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3538-3544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or NGF-induced early and secondary responsive gene expression (17Machida C.M. Scott J.D. Ciment G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Szeberenyl J. Erhardt P. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2105-2113PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively these findings document that NGF-dependent responses in PC12 cells occur through a pathway that is sphingosine-sensitive and phorbol ester-insensitive. These observations prompted us to characterize the expression of PKC isoforms in PC12 cells (12Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Soh Y. Ewald S.J. White K.R. Lloyd E.D. Olivier A. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and to further investigate the activation of these isoforms in response to NGF (19Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Coleman E.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that NGF leads to changes in all PKC isoforms (19Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Coleman E.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar, 20Coleman E.S. Wooten M.W. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To begin to unravel the role of this multigene family in neuronal differentiation and to provide clear insight into the role of the isoforms in neurite outgrowth, we have employed a reductionist view to their study. Since removal of both cPKC and nPKC does not abrogate NGF responses, we postulated that the aPKC pathway was dominant to those regulated by either the cPKC or nPKC isoforms for differentiation. This would be consistent with the inability of phorbol esters to inhibit NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Thus, we elected to focus on whether NGF activated the phorbol ester insensitive/atypical PKC-ζ isoform. We documented activation of atypical/PKC-ζ in response to NGF and parallel inhibition of this isoform by sphingosine (19Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Coleman E.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas, removal of PKC-ζ attenuates NGF responsiveness (20Coleman E.S. Wooten M.W. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings reveal that NGF-dependent responses leading to neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells are characterized by a pathway that is sphingosine sensitive, phorbol ester-insensitive involving atypical PKC (14Hall F.L. Fernyhough P. Ishii D.N. Vulliet P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4460-4466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Reinhold D.S. Neet K.E. J. Biol.

Res. 1997; 49: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As an extension of our previous studies, we sought to identify a substrate of PKC-ζ that was integral to NGF responses of PC12 cells, this led to the identification of a nuclearphosphoprotein, pp106. In this report, we characterize pp106 as a specific substrate for PKC-ζ. Purification and amino acid sequence analysis reveal that pp106 is the nuclear protein, nucleolin. These findings provide new clues for the role(s) PKC-ζ plays in NGF signaling and further support a growing body of evidence documenting a role for this kinase in RNA processing. PC12 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Sf9 cells and recombinant baculovirus containing the coding regions of PKC-α, -δ, -ζ were from Dr. G. Koch (University of Freiburg, Germany). Plasmids pRcCMVzeta and pRcCMVzetamut were gifts from Dr. J. Moscat (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain). Polyclonal antinucleolin antibody was a gift from Dr. Renato J. Aguilera (University of California at Los Angeles, Department of Biology). β2.5 S NGF and epidermal growth factor were purchased from Bioproducts for Science (Indianapolis, IN). Monoclonal antibody against PKC-ζ was obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal antibodies against retinoblastoma gene product (p107) and a polyclonal antibodies against both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110 and PKC-ζ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against topoisomerase I were both from Dr. W. C. Earnshaw (The Johns Hopkins University, MD) and ImmunoVision (Springdale, AR). Antibodies against PKC-μ and PLCβI were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), respectively. Secondary sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled antisera, ECL reagents, and Hyperfilm were purchased from Amersham. Goat anti-rabbit/fluorescein isothiocyanate coupled was purchased from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. PKC-α pseudosubstrate peptide (RFARKGALRQKNV), PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate peptide (SIYRRGARRWRKLYRAN), and myristoylated PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate peptide (N-myristoyl-SIYRRGARRWRKLYRAN) were synthesized by the Department of Biochemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY. Myristoylated PKC-α pseudosubstrate peptide (N-myristoyl-RFARKGALRQKNV) was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Lipofectin Reagent was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Protein dye-binding reagent was purchased from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. PC12 cells, PC12PKC-ζ(+), and PC12PKC-ζ(−) were seeded onto 100-mm plates coated with rat tail collagen, grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin), and maintained in a 92% air, 8% CO2 atmosphere. PC12 cells were transfected with pRcCMV-ζ (PC12PKC-ζ(+)) and pRcCMV-ζmut(PC12PKC-ζ(−)). pRcCMV-ζmut contains a mutant PKC-ζ gene (this construct is the original Xenopus laevis clone) in which a point mutation in codon 275 resulting in the substitution of lysine by tryptophan renders the enzyme inactive and confers a dominant-negative phenotype (22Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R.S. Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 50% confluent PC12 cells were washed with serum-free RPMI medium without antibiotics. 1–2 μg of the plasmids and 2–20 μl of Lipofectin reagent was diluted in 100 μl of serum-free medium, respectively. Lipofectin reagent was a 1:1 (w/w) liposome formulation of the cationic lipidN-(1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimmethylammonium chloride, and dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine in distilled water. 0.8 ml of serum-free RPMI medium was added into the Lipofectin reagent-DNA complex. The complex was mixed gently and overlaid onto the cells. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C, the DNA-containing medium was replaced by normal medium containing serum and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 37 °C. Cells expressing transfected genes were selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml neomycin (G418) as described previously (22Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Municio M.M. Sanz L. Lozano J. Chapkin R.S. Moscat J. Cell. 1993; 74: 555-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PC12 cells were collected with centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 2 min and resuspended in 1 ml of PKC sonication buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μmleupeptin, 10 mm aprotinin, 100 μm sodium fluoride) containing 2 mm MgCl2. Nuclei were isolated following a previously established procedure (21Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Wooten M.C. Seibenhener M.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Borgatti P. Mazzoni M. Carini C. Neri L.M. Marshisio M. Bertolaso L. Previati M. Zauli G. Capitani S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 224: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated at room temperature for 2 min and cooled in ice water for 5 min. Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 1%. After one dispersion through a 20-gauge needle, the concentration of MgCl2 was adjusted to 5 mm. The samples were centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were taken to be a mixture of cytoplasm and plasma membrane. The nuclear pellet was washed once more with PKC sonication buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, resuspended in 300 μl of PKC sonication buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and sonicated for 10 s. Concentrations of proteins in different fractions were determined by the Bio-Rad dye binding method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Nuclei obtained in this manner possess intact nuclear membranes and were free from significant cytoplasmic contamination (21Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Wooten M.C. Seibenhener M.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of PKC-ζ was carried out using 50 μg of nuclear protein denatured in SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 1.5m 2-mercaptoethanol, 15 mm SDS, 0.2 mg/ml bromphenol blue) and separated using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (19Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Coleman E.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar). The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and processed for immunoblotting with isoform-specific antisera as described previously (19Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Coleman E.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar, 20Coleman E.S. Wooten M.W. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The relative changes in intensities were determined by densitometry (Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI, Sunnyvale, CA). To a reaction (100 μl, total volume), 25 μg of nuclear protein was mixed with 65 μl of pre-mix containing 17.75 mm PIPES, pH 6.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 μg/ml phosphatidylserine. In the presence or absence of 150 μm PKC-ζ pseudosubstrate peptide, the assay was initiated by adding 5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (a 1:4 mixture of 200 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 750 μm ATP) for 10 min at 30 °C (24Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially the same method was used to examine phosphorylation of purified nucleolin by purified PKC-ζ. The reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Thereafter, the sample was boiled for 5 min and separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was then stained, destained, dried, and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C. Changes in the phosphorylation state of pp106/nucleolin were determined by densitometry. Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells (5 × 106) were seeded onto 100-mm dishes and incubated in IPL-41 insect medium for 1 h at 27 °C. After removing the medium, recombinant baculoviruses containing coding regions of PKC-α, -δ, and -ζ were added at a multiplicity of infection = 10 plaque forming units/cell and incubated with the cells for 1 h. Afterward, the inoculum was removed and 10 ml of fresh medium added. After a 4-day incubation, the cells were harvested, lysed at 4 °C in PKC buffer containing (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm phentlmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40) followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and used to purify individually expressed PKC isoforms as described previously (25Szallasi Z. Denning M.F. Smith C.B. Glugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Pettit G.R. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 840-850PubMed Google Scholar). The homogeneity and identity of purified PKC-α, -δ, and -ζ were confirmed by gel staining and Western blotting analysis using PKC isoform-specific antisera (20Coleman E.S. Wooten M.W. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 1.3 × 108 PC12 cells suspended in 60 ml of PBS, pH 7.3, containing 1% glucose and 1% bovine serum albumin, were treated with 100 ng/ml NGF for 5 min. Thereafter, the nuclei were isolated and used a protein for an endogenous protein phosphorylation assay. In this manner the 106-kDa protein was tagged to aid in its purification and identification during subsequent steps. The phosphorylation reaction/nuclear protein preparation was loaded on to a DEAE-Sephacel column previously equilibrated with DEAE column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 100 μm sodium fluoride). The column was washed with DEAE column buffer containing 75 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted with DEAE column buffer using a linear gradient from 200 to 600 mm NaCl and fractions collected, an aliquot of each fraction was spotted onto filter paper and counted by Cerenkov. In addition, a separate aliquot (30 μl) was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel followed by staining, drying, and exposure to x-ray film. The degree of enrichment of phosphorylated pp106 and the total number of protein bands in each fraction, in comparison to the “starter” endogenous assay sample, was used to further estimate recovery and subsequent purification of pp106. The fractions containing pp106 were pooled and the conductivity adjusted to that of heparin-agarose column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 100 μm sodium fluoride). The pool was then loaded onto a heparin-agarose column, washed with column buffer containing 200 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted with column buffer containing 600 mm NaCl. Fractions were collected and an aliquot was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/autoradiography. The fractions that contained pp106 were pooled and glycerol was added to a final concentration of 1%. The pooled fractions were loaded onto a Sephacyl S-200-HR and eluded with S-200 column buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mmEGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 100 μm sodium fluoride). The column was developed with S-200 column buffer. The homogeneity of the purified 106-kDa protein was confirmed by the presence of a single radioactive 106-kDa protein band upon long-term exposure of the autoradiogram and a single protein band upon staining of the gel. Purified 106-kDa nuclear protein was isolated, separated by electrophoresis on a 7.5% SDS gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. The 106-kDa protein band was identified by staining with Ponceau-S and excised, subjected to reduction, alkylation, and Lys-C digestion. The peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC and sequenced by automatic Edman degradation. A Swiss-Prot data base search was conducted for similarity between the derived sequences of the isolated peptides and rat nucleolin. PC12 cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for 0–30 min (acute). Thereafter, the cells were placed on ice and washed with cold PBS, followed by isolation of nuclei as described previously (20Coleman E.S. Wooten M.W. J. Mol. Neurosci. 1994; 5: 39-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Borgatti P. Mazzoni M. Carini C. Neri L.M. Marshisio M. Bertolaso L. Previati M. Zauli G. Capitani S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 224: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The isolated nuclei were resuspended in PBS and allowed to sediment onto polylysine-coated glass slides for 15 min and fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The nuclei were permeabilized by incubation in 80% methanol in PBS for 60 min at −20 °C. Alternatively, localization was monitored in cells that were plated directly onto coverslips that had been coated with a mixture of collagen/polylysine (4:1, v/v) and treated with NGF (50 ng/ml for 3 days). The coverslips were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 3 min in 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS and then incubated for another 3 min in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed nuclei or cells were blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (v/v) saponin for 2 h at 27 °C. Thereafter, polyclonal primary antibody either anti-PKC-ζ or anti-nucleolin (1:250) was added in blocking buffer overnight and incubated at 4 °C. The coverslips were rinsed three times, 5 min each followed by addition of goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (12 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 2 h in the dark at 27 °C. Thereafter, the coverslips were mounted in glycerol/PBS and observed using a Nikon Optiphot epifluorescence microscope. As control, samples were processed without primary antibodies, or in the case of PKC with antibody that had been previously preincubated with peptide antigen. In either case, no background fluorescence could be detected. In brief, PC12 cells were labeled overnight in growth media which had been diluted by half with serum-free/phosphate-free RPMI 1640 containing 100 μCi/ml32P. The cells were simulated with NGF and washed in ice-cold PBS, lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaVO3, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, 30 μm microcysin, and 1 μm leupeptin). The extracts were treated with DNase and RNase, followed by immunoprecipitation as described previously using a 1:500 dilution of anti-nucleolin antisera (26Miranda G.A. Chokler I. Aguilera R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 294-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed in immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.05% deoxycholate. The beads were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained, dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 1–3 days at −80 °C with intensifying screens. We initiated our search for substrates of PKC-ζ that might play a role in NGF signaling by examining nuclear lysates prepared from PC12 cells for endogenously phosphorylated proteins. Under conditions which favored PKC-ζ activation (24Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that NGF treatment of PC12 cells resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of a 106-kDa nuclear protein, reaching a maximum at 5 min post-treatment with NGF (Fig.1 A). Phosphorylation of pp106 was NGF dose-dependent in the range of 0–200 ng/ml, with 100 ng/ml being optimal. We observed that phosphorylation of pp106 was enhanced when cells were cultured at low cell density, and to lesser extent, in subconfluent cultures and almost absent in cells cultured at high cell density. In parallel, samples were Western blotted with PKC-ζ antibodies. An NGF-dependent increase in immunoreactivity of PKC-ζ (Fig. 1 B) was likewise observed in nuclei. Activity changes in nuclear PKC-ζ were monitored by phosphorylation of ε-peptide, ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV, a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 149–164 of PKC-ε pseudosubstrate motif substituting Ser for Ala159 (19Wooten M.W. Zhou G. Seibenhener M.L. Coleman E.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 395-403PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). NGF treatment resulted in a 37% increase in nuclear PKC-ζ activity, as well as, enzyme translocation from the cytoplasm as well as transport of enzyme into the nucleus as observed by immunoelectron microscopy (12Wooten M.W. Seibenhener M.L. Soh Y. Ewald S.J. White K.R. Lloyd E.D. Olivier A. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To examine whether NGF could directly mediate phosphorylation of pp106 at the nuclear level, isolated nuclei were directly stimulated with NGF: no change in the phosphorylation of the 106-kDa protein was observed (data not shown). To examine the localization of pp106 and PKC-ζ within the nucleus, nuclei were fractionated into envelope and nucleoplasmic fractions. Endogenous phosphorylation analysis revealed that phosphorylated pp106 was restricted to nucleus and localized within the nucleoplasm (Fig.2 A). PKC-ζ itself was likewise enriched in the nucleoplasm post-NGF treatment (Fig.2 B)"
https://openalex.org/W2079583982,"Aggregation of many cell-surface receptors results in tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous proteins. We previously observed the tyrosine phosphorylation of the platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule, PECAM-1 (CD31), after FcεRI stimulation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. Here we found that PECAM-1 was also transiently tyrosine-phosphoryated after adherence of these cells to fibronectin. Similarly aggregation of the T cell receptor on Jurkat cells also induced this tyrosine phosphorylation. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is a widely expressed cytosolic enzyme with two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains. SHP-2, but not the related protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, associated with PECAM-1. This association of the two proteins correlated with the extent of the tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1. A fusion protein containing the two SH2 domains of SHP-2 precipitated PECAM-1 from cell lysates and also directly bound to phosphorylated PECAM-1. In immune precipitate phosphatase assays, there was tyrosine dephosphorylation of PECAM-1. Therefore, integrin and immune receptor activation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM-1 and the binding of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which could regulate receptor-mediated signaling in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2033559416,"To understand whether expression of membrane-anchored heparin binding epidermal growth factor (proHB-EGF) is involved in renal epithelial cell survival, rat membrane-bound HB-EGF precursor was stably transfected into a renal epithelial cell line, NRK 52E cells (NRKproHB-EGF). When exposed to 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), there were no differences in growth rates among wild-type (WT), vector-transfected (NRKvector), and NRKproHB-EGF. However, when cells were grown in the presence of 1% FCS, the growth rate of NRKproHB-EGF was 65% faster. When confluent cell monolayers were exposed to H2O2 or etoposide, WT or NRKvectorexhibited significant apoptotic bodies and DNA laddering; in contrast, NRKproHB-EGF were resistant to both stimuli, as indicated by increased cell viability and marked decrease of apoptotic bodies and DNA laddering. When plated at high density onto plastic dishes without FCS, WT and NRKvector formed few attachments, did not proliferate, and underwent apoptosis. By day 3, no cells survived. Addition of exogenous recombinant HB-EGF (10−8m) to WT or NRKvector increased cell survival by <10% and incubation with conditioned media of NRKproHB-EGF had no effect. In contrast, NRKproHB-EGF attached and formed epithelial colonies, although they did not proliferate. After 3 days, cell viability was 84% of the initial cell number plated, and no evidence of apoptosis was present. When plated in 10% FCS, NRKproHB-EGFattachment to plastic substratum at 1, 2, and 3 h was 250% greater than that of WT or NRKvector. Addition of exogenous recombinant human HB-EGF to WT or NRKvector increased attachment by <50%. When grown on poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) or in the presence of the integrin receptor-blocking peptide GRGDTP, neither WT nor NRKvector attached to the substratum or formed cell-cell attachments. Compared with WT or NRKvector, NRKproHB-EGF exhibited 300% greater cell viability on either poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-coated dishes or in the presence of GRGDTP and formed cell clusters. When plated at low density (1 × 103 cells/1.5-cm dish) or at high density in the presence of an anti-HB-EGF blocking antibody, NRKproHB-EGF failed to form epithelial colonies. Addition of formalin fixed NRKproHB-EGF promoted EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in quiescent A431 cells and stimulated DNA synthesis and prevented H2O2-induced apoptosis in renal epithelial cells. These results indicate that membrane-bound HB-EGF promotes renal epithelial cell survival, possibly by promoting cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. The failure of either conditioned media or exogenous HB-EGF to reproduce these findings suggests that juxtacrine or tightly coupled paracrine interactions underlie this cytoprotection. To understand whether expression of membrane-anchored heparin binding epidermal growth factor (proHB-EGF) is involved in renal epithelial cell survival, rat membrane-bound HB-EGF precursor was stably transfected into a renal epithelial cell line, NRK 52E cells (NRKproHB-EGF). When exposed to 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), there were no differences in growth rates among wild-type (WT), vector-transfected (NRKvector), and NRKproHB-EGF. However, when cells were grown in the presence of 1% FCS, the growth rate of NRKproHB-EGF was 65% faster.

Mammalian kidney tubules are comprised of a single layer of polarized epithelial cells attached to a basement membrane. As with other cells, the epithelial cells of the kidney are susceptible to injury by toxins or ischemia, which can predispose to either necrotic or apoptotic cell death (1Bonventre J.V.

Cieslinski D.A. Humes H.D. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 492AGoogle Scholar). Expression of one of the EGF-like growth factors, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), increases in the kidney in vivo in response to acute renal tubular injury (15Homma T. Sakai M. Cheng H.-F. Yasuda T. Coffy Jr., R.J. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Acute epithelial cell injury disrupts cell polarity, cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix contact (16Racusen L.C. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 357-364PubMed Google Scholar, 17Molitoris B.

It has been proposed that cells are programmed to undergo apoptosis by default and require specific extracellular signals to survive. Confluent epithelial cells can be maintained for long periods of time in the absence of exogenous factors; however, at low cell density with no cell contact, epithelial cells undergo programmed cell death if exogenous growth factors are not provided (19Raff M. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). Similarly, when cultured epithelial cells (Madin-Darby canine kidney) are prevented from forming normal cell-extracellular matrix attachments, they undergo programmed cell death (20Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). As with other members of the EGF family of growth factors, HB-EGF is synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor (21Higashiyama S. Lau K. Besner G.E. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precursor for HB-EGF (proHB-EGF) exists as a 206 amino acid transmembrane protein and undergoes processing to an 86 amino acid secreted protein (mature HB-EGF) by a protein kinase C-dependent process (22Raab G. Higashiyama S. Hetelekidis S. Abraham J.A. Damm D. Ono M. Klagsbrun M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Both membrane bound TGF-α precursor and prepro-EGF have been shown to activate the EGF receptor in adjacent cells (24Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21393-21396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and recent studies have also indicated that proHB-EGF may be capable of juxtacrine stimulation of cell proliferation (23Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 25Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsburn M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Since exogenously administered EGF prevents apoptosis in subconfluent epithelial cells (19Raff M. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar), our hypothesis is that in confluent cells with normal cell-cell contact, membrane-anchored HB-EGF may serve as one of the mechanisms to prevent cell death of either normal or injured epithelial cells. In the present studies, we found that membrane-bound HB-EGF promotes renal epithelial cell survival in the absence of exogenous growth factors by promoting cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. We further found that neither exogenously administered HB-EGF nor conditioned media from cells expressing membrane-bound HB-EGF provided equivalent cytoprotection, suggesting that juxtacrine or tightly coupled paracrine interactions underlie the actions of membrane-bound HB-EGF. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 150–200 g, were given gentamicin 200 mg/kg every 12 h for two days to increase renal HB-EGF mRNA expression (26Sakai M. Zhang M. Homma T. Garrick B. Abraham J.A. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2128-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Following sacrifice, kidneys were removed for total RNA extraction by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method (27Chomczynski P. Sacci N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) was further purified by affinity chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose. Rat membrane-anchored HB-EGF cDNA was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from gentamicin-treated rat kidney RNA of a 692-base pair fragment representing the rat membrane-anchored proHB-EGF coding region (28Abraham J.A. Damm D. Bajardi A. Miller J. Klagsbrun M. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The primers used in this study were GGACCATGAAGCTGCTGCCGTCG and TAAGGAACCGCCATCTCAGAAGT, and polymerase chain reaction amplification was carried out for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and 58 °C for 45 s. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was ligated into pPCRTM II vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the HindIII-NotI digested cDNA fragment of membrane-anchored HB-EGF from this plasmid was ligated into a eukaryotic expression vector (pRc/CMV plasmid) (Invitrogen). NRK 52E cells were transfected by Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) with proHB-EGF/pRc/CMV and selected by continuous growth in G418 (400 μg/ml Geneticin; Life Technologies, Inc.). After 7 passages, 60 individual clones were isolated and screened for proHB-EGF expression by slot blot and Northern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled EcoRI-digested membrane-anchored HB-EGF cDNA fragment. Six clones expressing high levels of message were identified. Two of these clones, E15 and E56, were routinely utilized in these studies. Unless otherwise indicated, all results represent experiments in which both of these clones were used. As a control, NRK 52E cells were also transfected with pRc/cCMV plasmid alone and grown and maintained in G418. Nontransfected NRK 52E (WT) vector-transfected NRK 52E (NRKvector) and membrane-anchored HB-EGF-transfected cells (NRKproHB-EGF) were grown in DMEM (Sigma), containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, HyClone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 100 units/ml ampicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfected cells were routinely grown in G418 (400 μg/ml). To examine rates of attachment, cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/35-mm plates in replicate dishes; at the indicated times, media were removed, the plates were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and adherent cells were counted. For studies of interruption of cell/ECM association, cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm plastic tissue culture dishes, trypsinized, and replated at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well into 96-well plastic culture dishes that had been coated with polyHEMA (poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), 10 mg/ml solution in ethanol) (Sigma)) or were spread on 96-well plastic culture dishes containing 1 mg/ml of the peptide GRGDTP (Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA). For determination of [3H]thymidine incorporation, cells were cultured in 24-well plates until confluence and incubated in FCS-free DMEM medium for 72 h before addition of agonist. After 18 h of incubation with or without agonist, 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added and incubation was continued for an additional 4 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. After rinsing with ethanol, acid-precipitable materials were dissolved in 0.25 m NaOH, 0.1% SDS and counted by scintillation spectrometry (19Raff M. Nature. 1992; 356: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2486) Google Scholar). For determination of cell viability, 10 μl of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) solution (5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline(−)) was added to each well. Cells were harvested by adding 0.04n HCl in isopropanol after 4 h, andA 590 was measured by microplate reader. Cell viability was also assessed by cell counts and determination of floating cells. Total RNA from cultured cells was isolated by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (27Chomczynski P. Sacci N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total RNA, each consisting of 10–15 μg, were subjected to electrophoresis, transferred to S & S Nytran nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and fixed to the membrane by exposing to UV light. The membranes were prehybridized in a solution of 50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.5% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C. Following prehybridization, blots were hybridized with 0.5–1.0 × 107 cpm/ml of32P-labeled cDNA overnight at 42 °C. The cDNA probes used included a 686-kb EcoRI fragment of rat membrane bound HB-EGF, 1.3-kb PstI-BamHI fragment of rat type I collagen, 2.23-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment of rat type III collagen, and a 2.2-kb PstI-PvuII fragment of rat type IV collagen labeled to >108 cpm/μg by the random priming procedure using a commercially available kit (Amersham). After washing twice with 2 × SSC for 15 min at room temperature and at 65 °C with 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, and finally with 0.2% SSC, 0.1% SDS for an additional 15 min, the membranes were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. The blots were stripped and reprobed with a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA using the conditions of labeling, hybridization, and washed as described above. The levels of mRNA were quantitated by densitometry (Hopfer Scientific, San Francisco, CA) and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (30.Deleted in proofDeleted in proof.Google Scholar). In brief, cells were cultured with DMEM containing 10% FCS in 6-well plastic dishes, and subconfluent cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature, then reacted with a goat anti-rat HB-EGF antibody raised against recombinant rat HB-EGF (31McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1953–1964; : 9Google Scholar), and followed by the fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG that had been preabsorbed with normal rat serum to avoid nonspecific binding. Negative controls consisted of substitution of the primary antibody with an irrelevant IgG mouse monoclonal antibody, nonimmune goat serum or phosphate-buffered saline and were entirely negative for immunofluorescence. Two different markers of apoptosis were utilized: determination of typical apoptotic bodies stained by Giemsa dye; and DNA laddering by agarose gel electrophoresis. For the latter, subconfluent cells were rendered quiescent by incubation for 2 days in DMEM supplemented with 0.4% FCS. Cells were exposed to 0.5–1.0 mm hydrogen peroxide for 30 h or 25 μm etoposide (Sigma) for 24 h and collected by scraping cells into media in which they had been incubated. Floating cells were also collected. To analyze for the characteristic laddering pattern of DNA degradation in apoptosis, cells were lysed by adding DNA extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm EDTA·Na, and 0.5% w/v sodiumN-lauroyl sarcosinate). After phenol-chloroform extraction and high speed centrifugation, DNA was recovered in the aqueous phase and precipitated with ethanol/sodium acetate, separated on a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-Acetate, 1 mm EDTA) and visualized with ethidium bromide. Conditioned media obtained from either quiescent NRKvector cells or cells treated with 0.1 μm12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 30 min at 37 °C were employed for determination of soluble growth factor activity. The conditioned media from the WT and NRKvectorpretreated with TPA were also collected. Wild-type NRK 52E cells were grown to confluence in 24-well dishes and rendered quiescent by incubation for two days in DMEM without FCS. The cells were then incubated with 500 μl of conditioned media for 24 h; 1 μCi of [β]3H]thymidine was added for the final 4 h of incubation. In additional experiments, the conditioned media were subjected to heparin-Sepharose chromatography, and the heparin-bound fraction was batch eluted with 2 m NaCl and dialyzed against media prior to addition to quiescent cells. NRKproHB-EGF, WT and NRKvector cells were plated in DMEM containing 10% FCS (3 ml/well) in 50-mm plastic dishes and incubated for 48–72 h. After reaching confluence, the cells were washed three times with DMEM + 2m NaCl to wash away the soluble HB-EGF bound to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan and fixed with 5% buffered formalin for 5 min (22Raab G. Higashiyama S. Hetelekidis S. Abraham J.A. Damm D. Ono M. Klagsbrun M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The formalin fixed cells were washed twice with DMEM, scraped from the plate, resuspended, and added to subconfluent monolayers of WT and NRKvector cells for 24 h. In some experiments, [3H]thymidine was added for an additional 2 h, and thymidine incorporation was determined as above; whereas in other experiments, H2O2 (1 mm) was added, and cells were incubated for an additional 30 h. In addition, the formalin-fixed cells were added to subconfluent quiescent A431 cells (1 × 106cells/well). After 5 min, the A431 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove the overlain cells and solubilized in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% aprotinin). The protein concentration in the lysate was determined by the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (300 μg/lane) were immunoprecipitated by anti-EGF receptor antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), coupled with PANSORBIN (Calbiochem), separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol at 30 V for 16 h. The membranes were blocked by incubating with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween-20 for 2 h at room temperature and incubated with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY 20; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Cappel, Durham, NC) for 1 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase was detected by an ECL kit and exposed on Hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham). Results are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons used analysis of variance and the Bonferroni modification of Student's t test with p < 0.05 indicating significance. Previous studies have suggested that EGF, or members of the EGF growth factor family, may play an important role in repair of renal epithelial cell injury (8Humes H.D. Cieslinski D.A. Coimbra T.M.

Our finding that HB-EGF is strongly induced in renal epithelial cells in response to acute kidney injury (15Homma T. Sakai M. Cheng H.-F. Yasuda T. Coffy Jr., R.J. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 26Sakai M. Zhang M. Homma T. Garrick B. Abraham J.A. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2128-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) suggests that it may serve as an endogenous growth factor for repair of damaged renal epithelial cells. ProHB-EGF is a membrane-anchored precursor that is either cleaved to produce the soluble form of HB-EGF or may signal in the membrane-bound form in a juxtacrine manner (23Goishi K. Higashiyama S.

Since our previous in vivo studies used rats to examine HB-EGF expression in renal epithelial cells in response to acute injury, rat membrane-bound HB-EGF precursor was stably transfected into a rat renal epithelial cell line, NRK 52E, to investigate the potential role of proHB-EGF in mediation of renal epithelial survival. NRK 52E is an immortal nontransformed rat renal epithelial cell line that expresses EGF receptors but not prepro-EGF or TGF-α (32Walker C. Everitt J. Freed J.J. Knudson A.G. Whiteley L.E. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2973-2978PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, we utilized two clones (E15 and E56) of transfected NRK 52E cells expressing significant levels of proHB-EGF. Fig. 1 is a representative Northern blot analysis for proHB-EGF mRNA of clone E15. Expression of an approximately 1.0-kb band was visible only in the lanes of quiescent NRK 52E cells transfected with membrane bound HB-EGF (NRKproHB-EGF) but not in wild-type (WT) or vector-transfected (NRKvector) cells. In quiescent cells, endogenous HB-EGF mRNA was not detected by Northern analysis. HB-EGF immunoreactivity was detected in NRKproHB-EGF cells by either immunohistochemical staining of the cells or by immunoblotting, whereas it was essentially negative in WT or NRKvector (data not shown). We have previously shown that exogenous EGF or HB-EGF is a potent mitogen for quiescent NRK 52E cells (15Homma T. Sakai M. Cheng H.-F. Yasuda T. Coffy Jr., R.J. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1018-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the present studies, when cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, there were no obvious differences in growth rates among WT, NRKvector, and NRKproHB-EGF except after 5 days of growth (Fig.2 A). However, when grown in 1% FCS, the growth rate of NRKproHB-EGF was approximately 65% faster than that of either WT or NRKvector (Fig.2 B). When FCS was removed 2 days after plating cells at low density (5 × 104 cells/3.5-cm dish) with DMEM, 10% FCS, NRKproHB-EGF continued to grow at a faster rate for the subsequent 2 days than either WT or NRKvector, and the number of surviving NRKproHB-EGF cells was significantly greater 5 days after serum removal (Fig. 2 C). Addition of conditioned media obtained from NRKproHB-EGF to WT or NRKvector had no effect on cell growth or survival (Fig.2 D). Furthermore, exogenous recombinant HB-EGF (10−8m) had minimal effect upon cell growth or survival under these conditions (data not shown). In addition to potential regulation of proliferation, EGF as well as other growth factors may serve as cytoprotective agents (33Merlo G.R. Basolo F. Fiore L. Duboc L. Hynes N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). EGF has been shown to prevent programmed cell death in PC12, mammary epithelial, and colorectal carcinoma cells and to lessen nitric oxide-induced cytotoxicity in neurons (33Merlo G.R. Basolo F. Fiore L. Duboc L. Hynes N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 34Nakajima M. Kashiwagi K. Ohta J. Furukawa S. Hayashi K. Kawashima T. Hayashi Y Neurosci.

Of interest in the fetal kidney, exogenous EGF administration decreases apoptotic cell death in the nephrogenic zone of the developing kidney cortex and in the developing medullary papilla (36Coles H.S. Burne J.F. Raff M.C. Development. 1993; 118: 777-784PubMed Google Scholar, 37Koseki C. Herzlinger D. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In the present studies, when NRK 52E cells were plated at high density onto plastic dishes (1 × 105 cells/1.5-cm dish) in the absence of FCS, NRKproHB-EGF attached although they did not proliferate (Fig. 3 A). At 3 days, cell viability was 84% and only minimal apoptosis was present. In contrast, WT and NRKvector formed few attachments and failed to form clusters, did not proliferate, and by day 2 were noted to undergo apoptosis characterized by condensed nuclei and apoptotic bodies. By day 3, no WT or NRKvector cells survived. Addition of exogenous recombinant HB-EGF (10−8m) to WT or NRKvector only minimally increased cell survival (<10% increase) (Fig. 3 B), whereas incubation with conditioned media obtained from quiescent NRKproHB-EGF had no effect (data not shown). To assess further whether membrane-associated HB-EGF could confer protection against cytotoxicity in renal epithelial cells, quiescent confluent cells were exposed to H2O2(0.5–1.0 mm) or etoposide (25 μm). With either stimulus, WT or NRKvector exhibited DNA laddering (Fig. 3 C), whereas NRKproHB-EGF were resistant to both stimuli. Interactions of cells with extracellular matrix can regulate gene expression, differentiation, and proliferation (38Adams J. Watt F. Development. 1993; 117: 1183-1198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Juliano R. Haskil S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). When plated in the presence of 10% FCS, the initial attachment of NRKproHB-EGF to plastic substratum at 1, 2, and 3 h was 250% greater than that of WT or NRKvector (Fig.4 A). Addition of exogenous recombinant human HB-EGF (10−8m) to WT or NRKvector increased attachment by <50% (data not shown). In addition to increased attachment, cells stably transfected with proHB-EGF demonstrated increased extracellular matrix gene expression as evidenced by increased steady-state levels of types I and III collagen mRNA (Fig. 4 B). Conditioned media obtained from quiescent NRKproHB-EGF did not augment collagen mRNA expression in either WT or NRKvector. Low levels of type IV collagen mRNA were also detected in NRK 52E cells, which is consistent with previous studies indicating that these cells express little type IV collagen (40Creely J.J. Commers P.A. Haralson M.A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1988; 18: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). No differences in the levels of TGF-β mRNA levels were observed among the three cell types (not shown). To examine whether the growth and cytoprotective effects of membrane-bound HB-EGF were due entirely to enhanced attachment to and production of extracellular matrix, we incubated cells under conditions of disrupted cell/ECM interaction. Frisch et al. (20Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) have previously reported that when Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were grown on plates coated with polyHEMA, onto which the cells could not attach, spread, or lay down ECM normally, these cells underwent programmed cell death, a process they termed “anoikis.” On polyHEMA, neither WT nor NRKvector formed cell-cell attachments, and both underwent programmed cell death as indicated by detection of apoptotic bodies, DNA laddering, and MTT viability assays and cell counts (Fig. 5, A andB). These cells also failed to survive when the peptide GRGDTP, which blocks type I collagen, fibronectin, and vitronectin integrin receptors, was added prior to plating cells on plastic substrata, indicating that inhibition of cell-matrix interactions was involved in the observed cell death (Fig. 5 A). When NRKproHB-EGF were plated on polyHEMA, they formed cell clusters, although they could not attach and spread on this substratum. MTT assays and cell counts revealed 300% greater cell viability than WT or NRKvector. NRKproHB-EGF also exhibited significantly greater viability when plated in the presence of the RGD peptide (Fig. 5). When NRKproHB-EGF were plated at low density (1 × 103 cells/1.5-cm dish), epithelial colony formation did not occur, and cell survival was not different than that of WT or NRKvector. Furthermore, when NRKproHB-EGF were plated at high density in the presence of an anti-HB-EGF blocking antibody, epithelial colony formation was inhibited, whereas preimmune IgG had no effect. Therefore, even in the absence of attachment to extracellular matrix, membrane-bound HB-EGF promoted increased survival as long as cell-cell interactions could occur. The mechanisms by which transfection of proHB-EGF increased cell survival under these conditions have not been determined. Frischet al. (41Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 42Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) have recently reported that anoikis may be mediated by jun kinase activation and is inhibited by overexpression of either focal adhesion kinase or bcl-2 (41Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 42Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Further studies must be undertaken to determine whether these protective mechanisms are activated by membrane-bound HB-EGF in the absence of cell/ECM contact in these cells. Whereas the decreased requirement for anchorage-dependent growth is consistent with a transformed phenotype, the transfected cells did not proliferate in the absence of exogenous growth factors. It is also noteworthy that the results could not be reproduced by exogenous administration of HB-EGF or when the cells were plated at a density that precluded cell-cell interactions. Further studies were undertaken to examine the potential mechanism of activation of adjacent cells by the membrane-bound HB-EGF. To determine whether significant HB-EGF (or other growth-promoting agent) was present in a soluble form, conditioned media were applied to quiescent cells, and DNA synthesis was determined. Conditioned media from quiescent NRKproHB-EGF did not significantly increase [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with conditioned media of quiescent NRKvector(Fig.6). Activation of protein kinase C has been shown to induce proteolytic cleavage of membrane-bound HB-EGF to its soluble form (22Raab G. Higashiyama S. Hetelekidis S. Abraham J.A. Damm D. Ono M. Klagsbrun M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 592-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 24Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21393-21396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and treatment of NRKproHB-EGFwith the phorbol ester TPA significantly increased mitogenic activity of the conditioned media. Although TPA-treated conditioned media from NRKvector modestly stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation in quiescent cells, the magnitude of stimulation was significantly greater by the TPA-treated conditioned media of NRKproHB-EGF. Furthermore, after heparin-Sepharose chromatography, there was no mitogenic activity in the heparin-binding fraction of TPA-treated NRKvector conditioned media compared with quiescent NRKvector (1.26- versus1.23-fold that seen with no addition of conditioned media), whereas mitogenic activity was still present in the heparin-binding fraction of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated NRKproHB-EGFconditioned media compared with quiescent NRKproHB-EGF(3.19- versus 1.39-fold) (n = 2). We next examined whether proHB-EGF could signal in a juxtacrine manner in NRK 52E cells. A431 cells, which express a high density of EGF receptors, were overlain with formalin-fixed NRK 52E cells for 5 min, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Subsequent immunoprecipitation of A431 cell lysate with anti-EGF receptor antibody, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation and immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, demonstrated increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor following exposure to NRKproHB-EGF but not WT or NRKvector (Fig.7 A). When quiescent WT were overlain with formalin-fixed NRKproHB-EGF (1 × 105 cells) for 24 h, [3H]thymidine incorporation was increased approximately 2-fold (Fig. 7 B). Similar results were seen when quiescent NRKvector were overlain with NRKproHB-EGF (not shown). In addition to activation of mitogenic pathways, membrane-bound HB-EGF could be shown to induce cytoprotection against H2O2-induced apoptosis. When WT were overlain with formalin-fixed NRKproHB-EGF (1 × 105 cells/well) for 24 h, DNA laddering and morphologic evidence of apoptosis were significantly less in response to incubation for 30 h with 1 mm H2O2 than in WT without overlain cells (Fig. 7 C) or overlain with formalin-fixed WT (not shown). These findings suggest that in renal epithelial cells, juxtacrine activation by membrane-bound HB-EGF appears to be more effective than soluble HB-EGF as a cytoprotective agent. In this regard, Steel factor promotes the survival but not the proliferation of primordial germ cells in serum-free cultures by binding to the tyrosine kinase-associated receptor c-kit; whereas steel factor is produced in both soluble and plasma membrane-bound forms, the membrane-bound form is much more effective both in vivo and in vitroin promoting cell survival (43Godin I. Deed R. Cooke J. Zsebo K. Dexter M. Wyle C.C. Nature. 1991; 352: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 44Dolci S. Williams D.E. Ernst M.K. Resnick J.L. Brannon C.I. Lock L.F. Lyman S.D. Boswell H.S. Donovan P.J. Nature. 1991; 352: 809-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In summary, these results indicate that membrane-bound HB-EGF promotes renal epithelial cell survival, possibly by promoting cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. The failure of either conditioned media or exogenous HB-EGF to reproduce these findings suggests that juxtacrine or tightly coupled paracrine interactions underlie this cytoprotection. After tubulointerstitial damage in response to immunological or nonimmunological insults, membrane-bound HB-EGF may serve to prevent renal epithelial cell death and reorganize the tubulointerstitial tissues. In addition to defining the molecular mechanisms of renal epithelial cell survival, further studies are needed to determine the intracellular-signaling pathways activated by the receptors, and how these pathways suppress cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2130823450,"We have recently reported that chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) activates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene transcription in glial and neuronal cells. Here, we have examined the role of COUP-TF in microglial cells, the major target cells for HIV-1 infection in brain. We show that COUP-TF activates gene expression from both the lymphotropic LAI and the macrophage-tropic JR-FL HIV-1 strains. Although COUP-TF binds to the −352/−320 nuclear receptor responsive element of the long terminal repeat, it functions as a transcriptional activator by acting on the −68/+29 minimal promoter. This region is a direct target of transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. We report the discovery and features of a physical and functional interplay between COUP-TF and Sp1. Our cotransfection experiments provide evidence for a functional synergism between Sp1 and COUP-TF leading to enhanced transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat through the Sp1 element. In contrast, Sp3 functions as a repressor of Sp1- or COUP-TF-induced activation. We further demonstrate that COUP-TF and Sp1 are capable of physically interacting, via the DNA-binding domain of COUP-TF, in vitro and in the cell.

Macrophage-tropic isolates infect microglial cells more efficiently then do T cell tropic isolates and predominate early in the infection (12He J. Chen Y. Farzan M. Choe H. Ohagen A. Gartner S.

Therefore we have performed our studies with the macrophage-tropic JR-FL strain, compared with the T-tropic LAI strain.HIV-1 gene expression is controlled by a combination of viral and host cell transcription factors interacting with the long terminal repeat (LTR) region (for review, see Refs. 13Garcia J.A.

Science. 1987; 236: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), suggests that HIV-1 replication in the CNS uses transcription factors different from those in non-neural tissues (16Corboy J.R.

Transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 promoter is mediated by κB regulatory sequences of the LTR, through the action of the transcription factor NF-κB, both in neurons (19Rattner A. Korner M.

Besides the κB regulatory element, our recent data have highlighted the importance of the nuclear receptor-responsive element (NRRE), which appears to be the point of convergence of a network of physiological signals which modulate HIV-1 gene expression in brain cells. We have described that the orphan nuclear receptors COUP-TF/Ear3 (22Wang L.-H. Tsai S.Y. Sagami I. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

Our data have also demonstrated the importance of COUP-TF as a potent transcriptional activator in oligodendroglioma cells, of both the lymphotropic LAI and the neurotropic JR-CSF HIV-1 LTR. They revealed the action of the dopamine transduction pathway, which coupled to COUP-TF, contributes to enhance HIV-1 gene transcription in neuronal cells (25Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our findings have further established the importance of the retinoic acid signaling pathway in HIV-1 gene transcription in glial and neuronal cells (26Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22895-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Except for retinoid receptors, the role of transcription factors belonging to the steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor superfamily has not yet been described in microglial cells.In this report, we have investigated the functional effect and the molecular mechanisms by which the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF regulates HIV-1 gene expression in a human microglial cell line (27Janabi N. Peudenier S. Héron B. Ng K.H. Tardieu M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 195: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our findings reveal the importance of COUP-TF as an activator of LTR-driven transcription of both the T cell line-tropic LAI and the macrophage-tropic JR-FL HIV-1 strains. We provide evidence for a novel physiological and functional interaction between the DNA-binding domain of COUP-TF and the transcription factor Sp1, leading to enhanced transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR. In addition, our data reveal that the COUP-TF- and Sp1-induced stimulation is repressed by the transcription factor Sp3. These data describe novel molecular mechanisms which govern the network of interactions between the HIV-1 LTR, the transcriptional activators COUP-TF and Sp1, and the repressor Sp3, in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression.DISCUSSIONIn this report we have investigated the regulation of HIV-1 gene transcription in human microglial cells, which represent the primary target of HIV-1 infection in the central nervous system. Since we have previously shown that the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF is expressed in brain cells and leads to a transcriptional stimulation of the HIV-1 genome in oligodendroglioma and neuronal cells (25Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we have focused our studies on the regulation of HIV-1 gene transcription by COUP-TF in microglial cells. It is now well established that COUP-TF is able to exert both positive and negative effects on gene expression, depending upon the promoter and the cell contexts (29Schaeffer E. Guillou F. Part D. Zakin M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23399-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kimura A. Nishiyori A. Murakami T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Osumi T. Okamura R. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J.

Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2332-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We show here that COUP-TF proteins are present in human microglial cells and interact directly with the NRRE, spanning the −356/−320 LTR region of the lymphotropic HIV-1 LAI isolate, but are unable to bind to the mutant NRRE present in the macrophage-tropic HIV-1 JR-FL isolate. Interestingly, our transient expression data reveal that COUP-TF/Ear3 is able to activate HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription in microglial cells, independently of the NRRE sequence. This shows that COUP-TF is able to transactivate the LTR from the lymphotropic LAI and the macrophage-tropic JR-FL isolates.We have already reported that distinct cell-type specific and sequence-dependent mechanisms govern COUP-TF-induced stimulation. In oligodendrocytes this transcription factor stimulates HIV-1 gene transcription, either by direct interactions with its NRRE target site or also, depending on the LTR sequence, by cross-coupling interactions with downstream-located proteins. In neuronal SK-N-MC cells, the transcriptional stimulation induced by COUP-TF in the presence of dopamine is mediated by the minimal −68/+29 LTR region (25Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly the NRRE site in the JR-CSF LTR is not indispensable for the stimulation induced by the retinoic acid receptor, since the retinoid action appears to be mediated by downstream-located elements, such as the −247/−222 AP-1 region and, to a lesser extent, the NF-κB region (26Sawaya B.E.

Our cotransfection and in vitro experiments demonstrate the ability of COUP-TF to transactivate the LTR indirectly via the Sp1 sites, by direct interaction with the Sp1 protein. We present evidence for a direct association between the N-terminal part of COUP-TF, containing the DNA-binding domain, with Sp1. Our data show that COUP-TF can interact with Sp1 both in vitro and in microglial cells. This association leads to a functional cooperation between the two proteins, which is detected with the full-length LTR as well as the −68/+80 LTR region. Moreover we show that the C-terminal domain of COUP-TF is involved in the transcriptional activation.Previous studies have already described that the action of COUP-TFs can be mediated not only by direct interaction with their DNA-binding site, but also by protein-protein interaction. COUP-TFI/Ear3 and ARP-1/COUP-TFII are able to directly target components of the basal transcription machinery, such as the basal transcription factor TFIIB (39Ing N.H. Beckman J.M. Tsai S.Y.

TFIIB recognizes and associates with COUP-TF and two other members of the steroid hormone receptor family, via their activation domain (39Ing N.H. Beckman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.M. J.

In contrast, our findings reveal that COUP-TF associates with Sp1 via its N-terminal part, containing the DNA-binding domain. A direct interaction between COUP-TF and the transcription factors Oct1 and Oct2 has also been demonstrated in the regulation of the vHNFI promoter (30Power S.C. Cereghini S. Mol. Cell.

Recent reports describe that Sp1 is critical for in vivotranscriptional regulation of HIV, through its interaction with other DNA-binding proteins. A cooperative interaction between Sp1 and NF-κB, bound to the two adjacent binding sites, is required for optimal HIV-1 enhancer activation and inducible HIV-1 gene expression (32Majello B.

A physical interaction between Sp1 and the p53 tumor-suppressor gene has been described in the tumor necrosis factor-induced transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR (47Gualberto A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19680-19683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover in vitro and in vivo data suggest a direct interaction between Sp1 and Tat during transactivation (48Kamine J. Chinnadurai G. J.

Virol. 1993; 67: 6224-6233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here our findings reveal a novel direct association between two zinc finger proteins, Sp1 and COUP-TF, which leads to enhanced transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 genome. These data suggest a more general model for gene activation by the orphan receptor COUP-TF or steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptors, in the presence of Sp1-binding sites. As shown here, Sp1 bound to its DNA-binding site is able to associate directly with the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of the nuclear receptor. It is well known that the adjacent TATA element binds the general transcription factor TFIID, which directly interacts with TFIIB, which itself is able to bind COUP-TF. In such a situation, the nuclear receptor may function as an adaptor protein, bringing together Sp1 and TFIIB, thereby enhancing communication between the general transcription machinery and Sp1. Alternatively, COUP-TF may bring together Sp1 and a cell type-specific nuclear factor, leading to various levels of activation induced by COUP-TF in different cell types. The precise mechanisms which account for our observations in the case of HIV-1 and SV40 gene transcription need to be further investigated.The Sp1 multigene family contains three closely related members Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 which recognize the GC box and the GT motif (33Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). While Sp1 and Sp4 function as transcriptional activators, Sp3 is a bifunctional transcription regulator, whose activity is dependent upon the promoter and the cellular contexts (33Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 34Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Recent reports have established that different members of the Sp1 family exert opposite transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR. While Sp1 and Sp4 stimulate transcription of the LTR, Sp3 markedly represses the HIV promoter activity in HeLa and Drosophila SL2 cells. Sp3-dependent repression is dependent on the presence of the DNA-binding domain, indicating that repression occurs through interference with Sp1 binding to the GC motifs (32Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22 (1921): 4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our data confirm that Sp1 and Sp3 are present in microglial cells, and exert an antagonist action on LTR-driven transcription. Moreover they show that Sp3 is able to mediate transcriptional repression not only of the Sp1 action, but also of the COUP-TF action exerted via Sp1.Only a limited number of studies have been devoted to HIV-1 gene transcription in macrophages and microglial cells. A differential role of LTR elements for the regulation of basal and Tat-mediated transcription of HIV-1 has been reported in stimulated and unstimulated primary human macrophages (50Moses A.V. Ibanez C. Gaynor R. Ghazal P. Nelson J.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 298-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings establish the essential role of the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF as a transcriptional activator of LTR-directed HIV-1 gene expression in microglial cells. They further reveal a novel mechanism of HIV-1 gene transactivation by direct association of COUP-TF with Sp1, thus enhancing transcription via the minimal LTR region. Our present and previous studies (25Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reveal the remarkable diverse mechanisms by which COUP-TF regulates gene transcription of distinct HIV-1 strains and in different brain cells.

HIV-1 infection is established in the CNS by viruses present early in infection (11Stritzki J.M. Albright A.V. Sheng H. O'Connor M. Perrin L. Gonzalez-Scarano F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7654-7662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophage-tropic isolates infect microglial cells more efficiently then do T cell tropic isolates and predominate early in the infection (12He J. Chen Y. Farzan M. Choe H. Ohagen A. Gartner S.

Therefore we have performed our studies with the macrophage-tropic JR-FL strain, compared with the T-tropic LAI strain. HIV-1 gene expression is controlled by a combination of viral and host cell transcription factors interacting with the long terminal repeat (LTR) region (for review, see Refs. 13Garcia J.A. Gaynor R.B. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 157-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and 14Kingsman S.M. Kingsman A.J. Eur. J.

Analysis of HIV-1 directed gene expression in transgenic mice derived from CNS-isolated HIV-1 strains (15Koyanagi Y. Miles S. Mitsuyasu R.T. Merrill J.E. Vinters H.V. Chen I.S.Y. Science. 1987; 236: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), suggests that HIV-1 replication in the CNS uses transcription factors different from those in non-neural tissues (16Corboy J.R. Busy J.M. Zink M.C. Clements J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 1804-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Busy J.M. Lindstrom L.M. Zink M.C. Clements J.E.

Transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 promoter is mediated by κB regulatory sequences of the LTR, through the action of the transcription factor NF-κB, both in neurons (19Rattner A. Korner M. Walker M.D. Citri Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4261-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,20Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Neumann H. Wekerle H. Baeuerle P.A. Mol. Cell.

Besides the κB regulatory element, our recent data have highlighted the importance of the nuclear receptor-responsive element (NRRE), which appears to be the point of convergence of a network of physiological signals which modulate HIV-1 gene expression in brain cells. We have described that the orphan nuclear receptors COUP-TF/Ear3 (22Wang L.-H. Tsai S.Y. Sagami I. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16080-16086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wang L.H. Tsai S.Y. Cook R.G. Beattie W.G. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W.

Our data have also demonstrated the importance of COUP-TF as a potent transcriptional activator in oligodendroglioma cells, of both the lymphotropic LAI and the neurotropic JR-CSF HIV-1 LTR. They revealed the action of the dopamine transduction pathway, which coupled to COUP-TF, contributes to enhance HIV-1 gene transcription in neuronal cells (25Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our findings have further established the importance of the retinoic acid signaling pathway in HIV-1 gene transcription in glial and neuronal cells (26Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22895-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Except for retinoid receptors, the role of transcription factors belonging to the steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptor superfamily has not yet been described in microglial cells. In this report, we have investigated the functional effect and the molecular mechanisms by which the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF regulates HIV-1 gene expression in a human microglial cell line (27Janabi N. Peudenier S. Héron B. Ng K.H. Tardieu M. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 195: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Our findings reveal the importance of COUP-TF as an activator of LTR-driven transcription of both the T cell line-tropic LAI and the macrophage-tropic JR-FL HIV-1 strains. We provide evidence for a novel physiological and functional interaction between the DNA-binding domain of COUP-TF and the transcription factor Sp1, leading to enhanced transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR. In addition, our data reveal that the COUP-TF- and Sp1-induced stimulation is repressed by the transcription factor Sp3. These data describe novel molecular mechanisms which govern the network of interactions between the HIV-1 LTR, the transcriptional activators COUP-TF and Sp1, and the repressor Sp3, in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression. DISCUSSIONIn this report we have investigated the regulation of HIV-1 gene transcription in human microglial cells, which represent the primary target of HIV-1 infection in the central nervous system. Since we have previously shown that the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF is expressed in brain cells and leads to a transcriptional stimulation of the HIV-1 genome in oligodendroglioma and neuronal cells (25Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we have focused our studies on the regulation of HIV-1 gene transcription by COUP-TF in microglial cells. It is now well established that COUP-TF is able to exert both positive and negative effects on gene expression, depending upon the promoter and the cell contexts (29Schaeffer E. Guillou F. Part D.

We show here that COUP-TF proteins are present in human microglial cells and interact directly with the NRRE, spanning the −356/−320 LTR region of the lymphotropic HIV-1 LAI isolate, but are unable to bind to the mutant NRRE present in the macrophage-tropic HIV-1 JR-FL isolate. Interestingly, our transient expression data reveal that COUP-TF/Ear3 is able to activate HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription in microglial cells, independently of the NRRE sequence. This shows that COUP-TF is able to transactivate the LTR from the lymphotropic LAI and the macrophage-tropic JR-FL isolates.We have already reported that distinct cell-type specific and sequence-dependent mechanisms govern COUP-TF-induced stimulation. In oligodendrocytes this transcription factor stimulates HIV-1 gene transcription, either by direct interactions with its NRRE target site or also, depending on the LTR sequence, by cross-coupling interactions with downstream-located proteins.

Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22 (1921): 4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our data confirm that Sp1 and Sp3 are present in microglial cells, and exert an antagonist action on LTR-driven transcription. Moreover they show that Sp3 is able to mediate transcriptional repression not only of the Sp1 action, but also of the COUP-TF action exerted via Sp1.Only a limited number of studies have been devoted to HIV-1 gene transcription in macrophages and microglial cells. A differential role of LTR elements for the regulation of basal and Tat-mediated transcription of HIV-1 has been reported in stimulated and unstimulated primary human macrophages (50Moses A.V. Ibanez C. Gaynor R. Ghazal P. Nelson J.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 298-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings establish the essential role of the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF as a transcriptional activator of LTR-directed HIV-1 gene expression in microglial cells. They further reveal a novel mechanism of HIV-1 gene transactivation by direct association of COUP-TF with Sp1, thus enhancing transcription via the minimal LTR region. Our present and previous studies (25Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reveal the remarkable diverse mechanisms by which COUP-TF regulates gene transcription of distinct HIV-1 strains and in different brain cells. In this report we have investigated the regulation of HIV-1 gene transcription in human microglial cells, which represent the primary target of HIV-1 infection in the central nervous system. Since we have previously shown that the orphan nuclear receptor COUP-TF is expressed in brain cells and leads to a transcriptional stimulation of the HIV-1 genome in oligodendroglioma and neuronal cells (25Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we have focused our studies on the regulation of HIV-1 gene transcription by COUP-TF in microglial cells. It is now well established that COUP-TF is able to exert both positive and negative effects on gene expression, depending upon the promoter and the cell contexts (29Schaeffer E. Guillou F. Part D. Zakin M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23399-23408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kimura A. Nishiyori A. Murakami T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Osumi T. Okamura R. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J.

We show here that COUP-TF proteins are present in human microglial cells and interact directly with the NRRE, spanning the −356/−320 LTR region of the lymphotropic HIV-1 LAI isolate, but are unable to bind to the mutant NRRE present in the macrophage-tropic HIV-1 JR-FL isolate. Interestingly, our transient expression data reveal that COUP-TF/Ear3 is able to activate HIV-1 LTR-driven transcription in microglial cells, independently of the NRRE sequence. This shows that COUP-TF is able to transactivate the LTR from the lymphotropic LAI and the macrophage-tropic JR-FL isolates. We have already reported that distinct cell-type specific and sequence-dependent mechanisms govern COUP-TF-induced stimulation. In oligodendrocytes this transcription factor stimulates HIV-1 gene transcription, either by direct interactions with its NRRE target site or also, depending on the LTR sequence, by cross-coupling interactions with downstream-located proteins. In neuronal SK-N-MC cells, the transcriptional stimulation induced by COUP-TF in the presence of dopamine is mediated by the minimal −68/+29 LTR region (25Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23572-23576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly the NRRE site in the JR-CSF LTR is not indispensable for the stimulation induced by the retinoic acid receptor, since the retinoid action appears to be mediated by downstream-located elements, such as the −247/−222 AP-1 region and, to a lesser extent, the NF-κB region (26Sawaya B.E. Rohr O. Aunis D. Schaeffer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22895-22900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We show here that the minimal −68/+29 LTR region, containing two Sp1-binding sites, is sufficient for COUP-TF-mediated stimulation. Our cotransfection and in vitro experiments demonstrate the ability of COUP-TF to transactivate the LTR indirectly via the Sp1 sites, by direct interaction with the Sp1 protein. We present evidence for a direct association between the N-terminal part of COUP-TF, containing the DNA-binding domain, with Sp1. Our data show that COUP-TF can interact with Sp1 both in vitro and in microglial cells. This association leads to a functional cooperation between the two proteins, which is detected with the full-length LTR as well as the −68/+80 LTR region. Moreover we show that the C-terminal domain of COUP-TF is involved in the transcriptional activation. Previous studies have already described that the action of COUP-TFs can be mediated not only by direct interaction with their DNA-binding site, but also by protein-protein interaction. COUP-TFI/Ear3 and ARP-1/COUP-TFII are able to directly target components of the basal transcription machinery, such as the basal transcription factor TFIIB (39Ing N.H. Beckman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Malik S. Karathanasis S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1536-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). TFIIB recognizes and associates with COUP-TF and two other members of the steroid hormone receptor family, via their activation domain (39Ing N.H. Beckman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17617-17623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, our findings reveal that COUP-TF associates with Sp1 via its N-terminal part, containing the DNA-binding domain. A direct interaction between COUP-TF and the transcription factors Oct1 and Oct2 has also been demonstrated in the regulation of the vHNFI promoter (30Power S.C. Cereghini S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 778-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been well established that the Sp1 transcription factor (41Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) plays an essential role in the regulation of basal transcription as well as in Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR (42Jones K.A. Kadonaga J.T. Luciw P.A. Tjian R. Science. 1986; 232: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 43Sune C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J.

Recent reports describe that Sp1 is critical for in vivotranscriptional regulation of HIV, through its interaction with other DNA-binding proteins. A cooperative interaction between Sp1 and NF-κB, bound to the two adjacent binding sites, is required for optimal HIV-1 enhancer activation and inducible HIV-1 gene expression (32Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22 (1921): 4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 45Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M.

A physical interaction between Sp1 and the p53 tumor-suppressor gene has been described in the tumor necrosis factor-induced transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR (47Gualberto A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19680-19683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover in vitro and in vivo data suggest a direct interaction between Sp1 and Tat during transactivation (48Kamine J. Chinnadurai G. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3932-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,49Jeang K.T. Chun R. Lin N.H. Gatignol A. Glabe C.G. Fan H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6224-6233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here our findings reveal a novel direct association between two zinc finger proteins, Sp1 and COUP-TF, which leads to enhanced transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 genome. These data suggest a more general model for gene activation by the orphan receptor COUP-TF or steroid/thyroid/retinoid receptors, in the presence of Sp1-binding sites. As shown here, Sp1 bound to its DNA-binding site is able to associate directly with the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of the nuclear receptor. It is well known that the adjacent TATA element binds the general transcription factor TFIID, which directly interacts with TFIIB, which itself is able to bind COUP-TF. In such a situation, the nuclear receptor may function as an adaptor protein, bringing together Sp1 and TFIIB, thereby enhancing communication between the general transcription machinery and Sp1. Alternatively, COUP-TF may bring together Sp1 and a cell type-specific nuclear factor, leading to various levels of activation induced by COUP-TF in different cell types. The precise mechanisms which account for our observations in the case of HIV-1 and SV40 gene transcription need to be further investigated. The Sp1 multigene family contains three closely related members Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 which recognize the GC box and the GT motif (33Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). While Sp1 and Sp4 function as transcriptional activators, Sp3 is a bifunctional transcription regulator, whose activity is dependent upon the promoter and the cellular contexts (33Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 34Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Recent reports have established that different members of the Sp1 family exert opposite transcriptional regulation of the HIV LTR. While Sp1 and Sp4 stimulate transcription of the LTR, Sp3 markedly represses the HIV promoter activity in HeLa and Drosophila SL2 cells. Sp3-dependent repression is dependent on the presence of the DNA-binding domain, indicating that repression occurs through interference with Sp1 binding to the GC motifs (32Majello B. De Luca P. Hagen G. Suske G. Lania L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22 (1921): 4914Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Our data confirm that Sp1 and Sp3 are present in microglial cells, and exert an antagonist action on LTR-driven transcription. Moreover they show that Sp3 is able to mediate transcriptional repression not only of the Sp1 action, but also of the COUP-TF action exerted via Sp1.

A differential role of LTR elements for the regulation of basal and Tat-mediated transcription of HIV-1 has been reported in stimulated and unstimulated primary human macrophages (50Moses A.V.

https://openalex.org/W2074181772,"The serum response element is one of the major promoter elements of the immediate early response to extracellular signals. The serum response element includes two main binding sites for proteins: the Ets box, which binds p62TCF, and the CArG box, which binds p67SRF. These two proteins are direct targets for signal transduction pathways; p62TCF is a nuclear end point of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and p67SRF is targeted by the Rho/Rac small G-proteins. The mechanism by which the signal is further transduced from the transcription factors to the basal transcriptional machinery is poorly understood. Recent data have suggested that the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein, a transcriptional adaptor involved in the transactivation through a wide variety of enhancer elements, participates in p62TCF activity. We here show that the CREB-binding protein also cooperates in the process of transactivation by p67SRF. Cotransfections of expression vectors for the CREB-binding protein increased the expression, in response to serum, of reporters under the control of the c-fos serum response element. Interestingly, the C-terminal moiety of the CREB-binding protein was not necessary to observe this effect. The cooperation did not require the Ets box in the serum response element, and the CArG box was sufficient, indicating that the CREB-binding protein is able to cooperate with p67SRF in the absence of an Ets protein. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell extracts showed that p67SRF could be retained with antibodies directed against the CREB-binding protein, suggesting that the two proteins form a multimolecular complex in live cells. The physical interaction between p67SRF and the CREB-binding protein was further confirmed by two-hybrid assays in mammalian cells. Our results indicate that the CREB-binding protein cooperates with p67SRF and, thus, suggest that the serum response element is regulated by a multimolecular complex, which includes the CREB-binding protein, p67SRF, and p62TCF, with multiple interactions between the components of the complex.

The SRE is constitutively occupied by a complex of two proteins, p67SRF (4Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and recognizes a CArG box in the SRE (7Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. Tuil D. Schweighoffer F. Pinset C. Kahn A. Minty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). p62TCF does not bind autonomously to the element, but requires the assistance of p67SRF to efficiently contact the DNA (8Schröter H.

The sequence recognized by p62TCF, located upstream of the CArG box, is in the form CAGGA, a sequence that binds proteins from the Ets family. Several Ets proteins display a TCF activity on the c-fos SRE: ELK-1 (10Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G.F. Reddy E.S.P. Nordheim A.

Recent data suggest that activation through TCFs could be mediated by a coactivator or adaptor protein, the CREB-binding protein or CBP (26Janknecht R. Nordheim A.

CBP directly contacts sequence-specific transactivators via one of two interaction domains located, respectively, in the N-terminal or C-terminal part of the molecule (48Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Once recruited, CBP can modulate the transcription rate through various mechanisms. First, CBP includes two TADs located in the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of the molecule (33Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 951-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) that contact two general transcription factors: TATA-binding protein for the N-terminal TAD (26Janknecht R.

Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). In addition, CBP recruits a protein that displays a histone acetyltransferase activity (50Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Histone acetyltransferases destabilize the nucleosomal structure by acetylation of the N-terminal histone tails, which protrude from the nucleosome (51Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar). CBP not only recruits a histone acetyltransferase, but also displays a histone acetyltransferase enzymatic activity (52Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar, 53Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Thus, CBP may use several mechanisms to activate transcription, either by recruiting proteins of the transcripional machinery or by inducing a nucleosomal remodeling process.CBP has been implicated in the transactivation of the c-fosSRE through the p62TCF protein (26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 27Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We here show that CBP enhances transcriptional activation of the SRE even in the absence of the Ets-binding site, and thus in the absence of p62TCFrecruitment. This result indicates that CBP can also cooperate with p67SRF. Furthermore, we demonstrate the formation of a physical complex between p67SRF and CBP in live cells. In addition, we show that, whereas the transactivation through p62TCF seems to involve the C-terminal TAD, the N-terminal moiety of CBP is sufficient for transactivation through p67SRF. Taken together, our results indicate that CBP participates in c-fos SRE activation both through the p62TCF and the p67SRF proteins, and that this transactivation is mediated through two distinct TADs in the CBP molecule.DISCUSSIONThe SRE, which is a central element of the cell's immediate early response, binds several transcription factors and is targeted by several transduction pathways. In particular, p62TCF is a direct target for the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. p67SRF is required to assist p62TCF binding and is also independently a target for signal transduction pathways involving small G-proteins from the Rho/Rac family. Little is known about the mechanism used by these proteins to further transmit the activation signal to the minimal promoters of the genes controlled by the SRE element. Recently, Janknecht and collaborators (26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that CBP, a versatile adaptor protein, cooperates with p62TCF for transactivation through the SRE. We here show that, indeed, CBP participates in the transactivation through the SRE, since expression of CBP stimulated a response to serum through this element in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, in our study, the effect of CBP was observed in the absence of a functional Ets-binding site, and thus in the absence of TCF binding to the element. In many cell systems, the Ets-binding site is not necessary to observe a significant response to serum (22Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar,25Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 59Dalton D. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 60Johansen F.E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, although F9 cells, which were used in this study, express normal amounts of p62TCF, the ternary complex between p67SRF and p62TCF seems to be inactive in these cells (61König H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3607-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our result indicates that the participation of CBP in SRE transactivation does not absolutely require the Ets protein p62TCF. In contrast, a functional CArG box was indispensable to observe the stimulation of the SRE response, suggesting that the target protein of CBP in this function was p67SRF. Thus, CBP cooperates both with p62TCF(26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 27Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and with p67SRF (this study).CBP is a large molecule that includes several sites of interaction with various sequence-specific transcription factors and has two TADs. To determine which of these functional domains was involved in SRE transactivation, we have used deletion mutants of the protein. Interestingly, the N-terminal moiety of CBP was sufficient to stimulate the SRE response to serum. A C-terminal transactivation domain of CBP seems to be involved in the cooperation with p62TCF (26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, CBP uses two TADs for transactivation through the SRE, the N-terminal and the C-terminal TAD. In addition, these data demonstrate that CBP can transactivate the SRE in the absence of the domain bearing the histone acetyltransferase activity, which is located in the C-terminal part of the molecule, indicating that this intramolecular activity is not absolutely required in this system. A similar result has been obtained in the CREB model system (49Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).In addition, we also show that CBP and p67SRF form a complex in live cells, since the two proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from cell extracts. The interaction between p67SRF and CBP does not require that the transcription factor be bound to its target DNA sequence, contrary to what has been observed with MyoD (43Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The physical interaction between p67SRF and CBP is detected by co-immunoprecipitation assays, which require a high affinity between the proteins, suggesting that this interaction is strong. The interaction between the N-terminal part of CBP and p67SRF was confirmed in a two-hybrid assay in mammalian cells. However, analysis of various subregions of the N-terminal CBP did not allow us to determine more precisely the site of interaction in CBP. This suggests that CBP and p67SRF do not interact through the previously characterized domains of interaction (amino acids 1–101 for the glucocorticoid receptor; amino acid 461–661 for various transcription factors). A possibility is that two physically separate sequences are required for this interaction. p67SRF is not the only member of the MADS box family which is able to interact with CBP. Indeed, CBP is also able to contact, through an undetermined region, MEF-2, a member of this family of proteins that is involved in muscle cell differentiation (43Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 62Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).For SRE transactivation, p67SRF cooperates with p62TCF. Both p67SRF (this study) and p62TCF (26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar) physically interact with CBP. Thus, transactivation through the SRE might involve a multimolecular complex including CBP, p67SRF, and p62TCF, stabilized by multiple interactions between the partners in the complex. Interestingly, p67SRF is also involved in other processes such as muscle-cell terminal differentiation (63Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviäre C. Carnac G. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Indeed, p67SRF cooperates with the myogenic differentiation factors MyoD and myogenin for some muscle promoters' transactivation (64Catala F. Wanner R. Barton P. Cohen A. Wright W. Buckingham M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4585-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and is able to interact physically with these myogenic bHLHs (65Groisman R. Masutani H. Leibovitch M.-P. Robin P. Soudant I. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5258-5264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CBP interacts both with MyoD (43Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 62Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and p67SRF (this study). Thus, the cooperation between MyoD and p67SRF on muscle cell differentiation also might involve the cooperative recruitment of CBP resulting in the formation, on muscle promoters, of a multimolecular complex including CBP, p67SRF and MyoD, and which would be stabilized by multiple interactions between the various partners of the complex.

Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 47-58PubMed Google Scholar) is present in the upstream regulatory sequence of a number of immediate early genes such as c-fos (2Treisman R.

The SRE is constitutively occupied by a complex of two proteins, p67SRF (4Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) and p62TCF (5Shaw P.E. Schrı̂ter H. Nordheim A. Cell. 1989; 56: 563-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). p67SRF belongs to the MADS box family of proteins (6Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4698-4706Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and recognizes a CArG box in the SRE (7Phan-Dinh-Tuy F. Tuil D. Schweighoffer F. Pinset C. Kahn A. Minty A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). p62TCF does not bind autonomously to the element, but requires the assistance of p67SRF to efficiently contact the DNA (8Schröter H. Mueller C.G. Meese K. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1123-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 9Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The sequence recognized by p62TCF, located upstream of the CArG box, is in the form CAGGA, a sequence that binds proteins from the Ets family. Several Ets proteins display a TCF activity on the c-fos SRE: ELK-1 (10Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G.F. Reddy E.S.P. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), SAP-1 (11Dalton S. Treisman R.

The SRE is also recognized by oncogenic fusion proteins such as EWS-FLI (14Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Masutani H. Robin P. Lipinski M. Harel-Bellan A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TCFs can be distinguished by their pattern of expression (15Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Masutani H. Lipinski M.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), or on a functional basis (13Price M.A. Rogers A.E. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2589-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Both p67SRF and p62TCF contain a transactivation domain (TAD) (18Liu S.H. Ma J.T. Yueh A.Y. Lees-Miller S.P. Anderson C.W.

Transactivation by TCF TADs is induced by mitogens (20Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1209-1216PubMed Google Scholar, 21Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). TCF-TADs are direct targets for the Ras/MAP kinase transduction pathway and are substrates for ERK-1 and ERK-2 (22Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 23Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), suggesting that phosphorylation by MAP kinases activates these domains. p67SRF is a direct target for a poorly defined signal transduction pathway (25Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the activating signal, transmitted through the SRE, is further transduced to the transcriptional machinery and the minimal promoter is unknown. Recent data suggest that activation through TCFs could be mediated by a coactivator or adaptor protein, the CREB-binding protein or CBP (26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 27Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The CBP adaptor protein was first characterized as a co-activator for CREB, a cAMP-responsive transcription factor (28Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H.

CBP is highly homologous to p300, a transcriptional co-activator (30Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) that is a target for viral transforming proteins such as E1A (31Arany Z. Sellers W.R. Livingston D.M. Eckner R.

CBP not only recruits a histone acetyltransferase, but also displays a histone acetyltransferase enzymatic activity (52Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar, 53Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar). Thus, CBP may use several mechanisms to activate transcription, either by recruiting proteins of the transcripional machinery or by inducing a nucleosomal remodeling process. CBP has been implicated in the transactivation of the c-fosSRE through the p62TCF protein (26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 27Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We here show that CBP enhances transcriptional activation of the SRE even in the absence of the Ets-binding site, and thus in the absence of p62TCFrecruitment. This result indicates that CBP can also cooperate with p67SRF. Furthermore, we demonstrate the formation of a physical complex between p67SRF and CBP in live cells. In addition, we show that, whereas the transactivation through p62TCF seems to involve the C-terminal TAD, the N-terminal moiety of CBP is sufficient for transactivation through p67SRF. Taken together, our results indicate that CBP participates in c-fos SRE activation both through the p62TCF and the p67SRF proteins, and that this transactivation is mediated through two distinct TADs in the CBP molecule. DISCUSSIONThe SRE, which is a central element of the cell's immediate early response, binds several transcription factors and is targeted by several transduction pathways. In particular, p62TCF is a direct target for the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. p67SRF is required to assist p62TCF binding and is also independently a target for signal transduction pathways involving small G-proteins from the Rho/Rac family. Little is known about the mechanism used by these proteins to further transmit the activation signal to the minimal promoters of the genes controlled by the SRE element. Recently, Janknecht and collaborators (26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that CBP, a versatile adaptor protein, cooperates with p62TCF for transactivation through the SRE. We here show that, indeed, CBP participates in the transactivation through the SRE, since expression of CBP stimulated a response to serum through this element in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, in our study, the effect of CBP was observed in the absence of a functional Ets-binding site, and thus in the absence of TCF binding to the element. In many cell systems, the Ets-binding site is not necessary to observe a significant response to serum (22Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar,25Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R.

Moreover, although F9 cells, which were used in this study, express normal amounts of p62TCF, the ternary complex between p67SRF and p62TCF seems to be inactive in these cells (61König H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3607-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our result indicates that the participation of CBP in SRE transactivation does not absolutely require the Ets protein p62TCF. In contrast, a functional CArG box was indispensable to observe the stimulation of the SRE response, suggesting that the target protein of CBP in this function was p67SRF. Thus, CBP cooperates both with p62TCF(26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar, 27Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and with p67SRF (this study).CBP is a large molecule that includes several sites of interaction with various sequence-specific transcription factors and has two TADs. To determine which of these functional domains was involved in SRE transactivation, we have used deletion mutants of the protein. Interestingly, the N-terminal moiety of CBP was sufficient to stimulate the SRE response to serum. A C-terminal transactivation domain of CBP seems to be involved in the cooperation with p62TCF (26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, CBP uses two TADs for transactivation through the SRE, the N-terminal and the C-terminal TAD. In addition, these data demonstrate that CBP can transactivate the SRE in the absence of the domain bearing the histone acetyltransferase activity, which is located in the C-terminal part of the molecule, indicating that this intramolecular activity is not absolutely required in this system. A similar result has been obtained in the CREB model system (49Swope D.L. Mueller C.L. Chrivia J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28138-28145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).In addition, we also show that CBP and p67SRF form a complex in live cells, since the two proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from cell extracts. The interaction between p67SRF and CBP does not require that the transcription factor be bound to its target DNA sequence, contrary to what has been observed with MyoD (43Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The physical interaction between p67SRF and CBP is detected by co-immunoprecipitation assays, which require a high affinity between the proteins, suggesting that this interaction is strong. The interaction between the N-terminal part of CBP and p67SRF was confirmed in a two-hybrid assay in mammalian cells. However, analysis of various subregions of the N-terminal CBP did not allow us to determine more precisely the site of interaction in CBP. This suggests that CBP and p67SRF do not interact through the previously characterized domains of interaction (amino acids 1–101 for the glucocorticoid receptor; amino acid 461–661 for various transcription factors). A possibility is that two physically separate sequences are required for this interaction. p67SRF is not the only member of the MADS box family which is able to interact with CBP. Indeed, CBP is also able to contact, through an undetermined region, MEF-2, a member of this family of proteins that is involved in muscle cell differentiation (43Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 62Sartorelli V. Huang J. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar).For SRE transactivation, p67SRF cooperates with p62TCF. Both p67SRF (this study) and p62TCF (26Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1961-1969PubMed Google Scholar) physically interact with CBP. Thus, transactivation through the SRE might involve a multimolecular complex including CBP, p67SRF, and p62TCF, stabilized by multiple interactions between the partners in the complex. Interestingly, p67SRF is also involved in other processes such as muscle-cell terminal differentiation (63Vandromme M. Gauthier-Rouviäre C. Carnac G. Lamb N. Fernandez A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1489-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Indeed, p67SRF cooperates with the myogenic differentiation factors MyoD and myogenin for some muscle promoters' transactivation (64Catala F. Wanner R. Barton P. Cohen A. Wright W. Buckingham M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4585-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and is able to interact physically with these myogenic bHLHs (65Groisman R. Masutani H. Leibovitch M.-P. Robin P. Soudant I. Trouche D. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5258-5264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). CBP interacts both with MyoD (43Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1010-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) and p67SRF (this study). Thus, the cooperation between MyoD and p67SRF on muscle cell differentiation also might involve the cooperative recruitment of CBP resulting in the formation, on muscle promoters, of a multimolecular complex including CBP, p67SRF and MyoD, and which would be stabilized by multiple interactions between the various partners of the complex.

Accordingly, we have investigated mechanisms regulating synthesis of PGE2 that might contribute to autocrine/paracrine effects on insulin-like growth factor-1 production. In response to zymosan, TNFα specifically induced a 5-fold increase in PGE2 synthesis, at the same time decreasing PGD2 production in a reciprocal fashion. Activators of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), such as PGE2 itself or dibutyryl cyclic AMP, did not modify PGE2 production by themselves but potentiated the TNFα-induced increase in PGE2; this effect required both RNA and protein synthesis. No significant change in arachidonate release or production of other eicosanoids was observed. The inducible form of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) but not of the constitutive form COX1 was implicated in the generation of both PGE2 and PGD2 in these cells by use of specific inhibitors and effects of dexamethasone. Neither COX1 nor COX2 protein levels were affected by TNFα or PKA activators used alone, whereas in association, marked up-regulation of COX2 mRNA and protein was observed. Incubations of cells carried out with PGH2demonstrated that PGE2 synthase activity was increased after a TNFα pretreatment. Taken together, our results suggest that TNFα induced a switch from the PGD2 to PGE2synthesis pathway by regulating PGE2 synthase expression and/or activity and that activators of PKA markedly potentiated the TNFα-induced increase in PGE2 through up-regulation of COX2 gene expression.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10364-10371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prostaglandins may also act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to modulate the responses of the macrophages themselves (10Chu E.

We have previously shown that in murine macrophages, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) increased the synthesis of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a growth factor for fibroblasts, by a TNFα-independent signaling pathway. The effect of TNFα on this PGE2-induced process was additive (13Fournier T. Riches D.W.H. Winston B.W. Rose D.M. Young S.K. Noble P.W. Lake F.R. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2123-2133PubMed Google Scholar). Since macrophages are themselves a potent source of PGE2, autocrine up-regulation of IGF-1 was a distinct possibility. Furthermore, TNFα might itself alter the IGF-1 response by, in part, enhancing production of PGE2. Accordingly, in this study, we addressed the effects of TNFα and PGE2 on PGE2 production in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Since PGE2 acts by receptor-mediated generation of cyclic AMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA), the effect of direct addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) was also examined. The first enzymatic step in eicosanoid synthesis is the release of free arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phospholipid. Depending on the cell type and stimulus, different forms of phospholipase A2(PLA2), including an 85-kDa cytosolic PLA2(cPLA2) (14Schalkwijk C.G. de Vet E. Pfeilschifter J. van den Bosch H. Eur. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20713-20716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have each been described to play a role in mediating AA release and subsequent prostaglandin synthesis. Agents that stimulate AA release in macrophages, including zymosan, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, calcium ionophore A23187, and okadaic acid, can activate cPLA2 by enhancing serine phosphorylation of the enzyme (21Qiu Z.-H. de Carvalho M.S. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24506-24513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, a role for mitogen-activated protein kinase has been described in mediation of agonist-induced activation of cPLA2 (22Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 23Qiu Z.-H. Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19480-19487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytokine-induced changes in gene expression of sPLA2 have been reported in rat mesangial cells (24Konieczkowski M. Sedor J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2425-2532Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and human synovial cells (25Angel J. Berenbaum F. Le Denmat C. Nevalainen T. Masliah J. Fournier C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but the activity of these enzymes is presumably also regulated by the extent and location of their secretion. Prostaglandin endoperoxide-synthase or cyclooxygenase (COX) catalyzes the conversion of AA to PGH2, which is then metabolized by one or more terminal synthases to a variety of biologically active prostanoids (26Vane J. Nature. 1994; 367: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase is a key enzyme in prostanoid synthesis and possesses both fatty acid cyclooxygenase activity (producing PGG2 from AA) and PG hydroperoxidase activity (converting PGG2 to PGH2). COX2 is a recently described form of cyclooxygenase that is induced in a number of cells by proinflammatory stimuli, which contrasts to the lack of induction seen with the previously characterized constitutive enzyme, COX1 (27Feng L.

Thus, COX2 is thought to contribute to the generation of prostanoids at sites of inflammation (28Murakami M. Matsumoto R. Austen K.F. Arm J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22269-22275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (see Ref. 29Otto J.C. Smith W.L. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1995; 12: 139-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar for review). In the current study, the ability of murine macrophages to synthesize PGE2 in response to a phagocytic particle (zymosan) was selectively induced by TNFα. In contrast, a concomitant decrease in PGD2 production was observed after TNFα priming, suggesting a striking switch from production of PGD2 to PGE2 and regulation of PG synthase activity. In addition, we show herein that activators of PKA markedly potentiated the TNFα-induced increase in PGE2 through up-regulation of COX2 gene expression. Our results suggest that (i) PGE2might act as an autocrine mediator to stimulate and to maintain the differentiation of uncommitted macrophages into IGF-1 producing cells and (ii) this differentiated cell type may participate in an exocrine fashion to regulate the inflammatory response by its ability to synthesize and release PGE2. C3H/HeJ mice were bred in the Biological Resource Center at the National Jewish Center. The C3H/HeJ strain is lipopolysaccharide hyporesponsive and was chosen to minimize the effects of trace lipopolysaccharide contamination (30Pace J.L. Russell S.W. Leblanc P.A. Murasko D.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 977-981PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 8-week-old mice were killed by CO2 narcosis. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was obtained from Bio-Whittaker (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum (Hybri-Max) as well as all chemical compounds were purchased from Sigma except for valeryl salicylate and NS-398, which were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Nonidet P-40 was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, and nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Bio-Rad. Recombinant murine TNFα was generously provided by Genentech, Inc. Zileuton (A64077) was obtained from Abbott Laboratories (North Chicago, IL). Zymosan was purchased from Sigma and opsonized using a human serum pool as described (3Bonney R.J. Wightman P.D.

Antibodies for LTB4 and LTC4 were purchased from Advanced Magnetics (Boston, MA). RNAzol B was purchased from Tel-Test, Inc. (Friendswood, TX), and BCA protein assay was purchased from Pierce. Murine COX1 cDNA probe was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI), and murine COX2 mRNA analysis was performed using a 1.8-kilobase pair cDNA insert kindly provided by Dr Voelkel (UCHSC, Denver). Human glyceraldehyde 3-phosphodehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was provided by J. Shannon (National Jewish Center, Denver). Both monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. J. Maclouf (INSERM, Paris). Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were obtained using a technique previously described in detail (31Riches D.W. Henson P.M. Remigio L.K. Catteral J.F. Strunk R.C. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 180-188PubMed Google Scholar). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.37% (w/v) NaHCO3, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 10% (v/v) L929 cell-conditioned medium as a source of colony-stimulating factor-1 was used for the isolation, culture, and stimulation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Bone marrow cells were flushed asceptically from the dissected pelvises, femurs, and tibias of C3H/HeJ mice with a jet of complete medium directed through a 25-gauge needle to form a single cell suspension. The bone marrow cells were dispensed at a concentration of 0.45 × 106 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates for the eicosanoid study, 11 × 106 cells/100-mm diameter culture dishes for protein immunoblotting, and at a concentration of 1.8 × 106 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates for RNA analysis. The cells were matured at 37 °C under a 10% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere for 5 days before use. After incubation of macrophages for the indicated period of time with various stimuli, the cell monolayers were washed twice in Ca2+, Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4; then, cells were incubated for 1 h with the phagocytic stimulus (50 particles of opsonized zymosan per cell) or with 10 μm exogenous AA in 2% BSA-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The culture medium was centrifuged to remove nonadherent cells and assayed for AA metabolites using enzyme immunoassay methods previously described (32Pradelles P. Grassi J. Maclouf J. Anal. Chem. 1985; 57: 1170-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 33Westcott J.Y. Johnston K. Batt A. Wenzel S.E. Voelkel N.F. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 68: 2640-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). LTB4, LTC4, TXB2, and 6-keto-PGF1α (the stable metabolite of PGI2) were assayed directly from fresh supernatants while PGD2and PGE2 were measured as their methyl oximes after derivatization with methoxamine as described by Kelly et al.(34Kelly R.W. Deam S. Cameron M.J. Seamark R.F. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Med. 1986; 24: 1-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Macrophage monolayers were scraped in 500 μl of 0.5N sodium hydroxide, and total protein was determined using a BCA protein assay. Eicosanoid levels were all expressed as picograms per microgram of macrophage protein. Total content of free AA in both cell lysates and supernatants was measured using a quantitative mass spectrometric assay (35Hadley J.S. Fradin A. Murphy R.C. Biochem. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 15: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophage monolayers maintained in culture medium (0.45 × 105 cells/ml) were lysed by adding 1 ml of MeOH directly in the well, and lysates (2 ml) were acidified to pH 3 with 100 μl of 1 N HCl. Free AA was extracted twice with one volume of hexane and dried under vacuum. The pentafluorobenzyl ester was synthesized by adding a 10% solution of pentafluorobenzyl bromide in acetonitrile (50 μl) and an equal volume of a 10% solution of diisopropylamine in acetonitrile and then allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 min. After vacuum evaporation of reagents, the derivative was dissolved in 100 μl of hexane for electron capture ionization mass spectrometric analysis (36Antoine C. Murphy R.C. Henson P.M. Maclouf J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1128: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Free arachidonic acid levels were expressed as nanograms per well using a calibration curve. Mouse macrophages were isolated, cultured, and stimulated as described above. Prostaglandin synthase activity was performed according to Kelner and Uglik (37Kelner M.J. Uglik S.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). After a 16-h incubation period, cells (2 × 106) were collected by scraping and resuspended in 100 μl of cold buffer (50 mm TRIS, pH 7.5, 0.1 m sodium chloride, 0.1 m EDTA). The cells were lysed by freezing/thawing them twice in a acetone-dry ice bath and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Supernatants were warmed to 37 °C in a water bath for 1 min, and reduced glutathione (6 μg in 10 μl) was added for 1 min. Then, 150 ng of PGH2 was added for 1 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of a 25 mm FeCl2 solution. Spontaneous conversion was evaluated by incubating PGH2 in buffer alone with no cell. The concentrations of PGE2 and PGD2 at 0 and 1 min were determined by enzyme immunoassay. The expression of COX1, COX2, and GAPDH mRNA transcripts was determined by Northern analysis. Total cellular RNA was extracted from macrophage monolayers with 1 ml of RNAzol B for 1.8 × 106 cells (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions through a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and then transferred to NYTRAN hybridization filters as described (39Noble P.W. Lake F.R. Henson P.M. Riches D.W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2368-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Total RNA was covalently linked to the membrane by UV cross-linking (0.12 joules) using a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). The blots were hybridized with 106 dpm/ml of 32P-labeled cDNA probes for 18 h and washed to a final stringency of 0.2 × SSC at 42 °C, and autoradiograms were prepared by exposure to Kodak X-OMAT AR film at −70 °C. To ensure that the differences in transcript expression were specific to COX1 and COX2 mRNA and not due to differential loading of RNA, the blots were stripped in 2% glycerol for 3 min at 100 °C and reprobed with GAPDH. The density of the autoradiographic signals was quantified by scanning densitometry combined with integration using the “Image 1.35” software run on a Macintosh microcomputer. The results were expressed as a ratio of COX to GAPDH expression as indicated. Macrophage monolayers were scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm aprotinin. 50 μg of total protein determined using a BCA protein assay were separated in SDS/10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were washed in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST), blocked overnight with 5% (w/v) fat-free dry milk in TBST. The same blot was probed with a monoclonal antibody for COX1, stripped, and then reprobed with a monoclonal antibody for COX2. Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. for at least three separate experiments. Comparisons between groups were made using the student's paired t test. Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were cultured for 5 days in the presence of colony-stimulating factor-1, followed by priming with TNFα, PGE2, or dbcAMP alone or in combination for a period of 16 h. After the culture medium was removed and cell monolayers washed, macrophages were stimulated for 1 h with 50 particles per cell of opsonized zymosan in fresh culture medium to promote production and release of arachidonic acid metabolites. Previous analysis had shown this amount and time of exposure to zymosan to be optimal (data not shown). As shown in Fig.1, 10 ng/ml TNFα led to a 5-fold increase in PGE2 production, whereas no change was observed in response to either 0.1 mm dbcAMP or 1 μmPGE2 treatment alone. However, when cells were incubated with the combination TNFα+dbcAMP or TNFα+PGE2, synergistic responses were observed corresponding to a 4-fold increase and a 2-fold increase compared with TNFα alone for dbcAMP and PGE2, respectively. To determine the point at which the TNFα and PGE2 were exerting their effect, the release of free AA was analyzed to explore the possibility that these effectors may affect the balance of deacylation and reacylation. To block metabolism of free AA released by COX and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), cells were incubated in the presence of 5 μm indomethacin to block the COX activity (40Futaki N. Takahishi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) and 5 μm zileuton to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase (41Wenzel S.E. Trudeau J.B. Kaminsky D.A. Cohn J. Martin R.J. Westcott J.Y. Am. J. Crit. Care Med. 1995; 152: 897-905Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar) for the 1-h stimulation period with zymosan. In Fig.2, intracellular plus extracellular AA content is shown, as determined by mass spectrometry and expressed as nanogram/0.45 × 106 cells. Independently of the presence of the inhibitors, no significant variations in AA release were observed in response to any of the stimuli. Differences observed in AA release between the presence and absence of the COX and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors are likely due to utilization of AA as substrate. Similar results were obtained when AA release was analyzed after the cells had been labeled with [3H]AA (data not shown). These results suggest that the effect of TNFα on PGE2 levels with or without dbcAMP is not due to enhanced phospholipase activity. To determine whether the observed induced increase in PGE2 production was exclusive to PGE2, the effect on other AA metabolites known to be produced by macrophages was examined. The production of two cyclooxygenase metabolites, TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1α (the stable PGI2 metabolite), as well as two 5-lipoxygenase products (LTC4 and LTB4), were quantified in the supernatant of cells primed for 18 h with the various stimuli and then stimulated with zymosan. Table I shows that untreated cells released high levels of TXB2 (12.95 pg/μg), whereas release of the other eicosanoids was low. In contrast to PGE2 (Fig. 1), TNFα alone or in combination with dbcAMP did not significantly increase the production of any of these four AA metabolites studied. Interestingly, a slight but significant increase in TXB2 and LTB4 release was observed in dbcAMP-treated cells.Table ITXB2, 6-keto-PGF1α, LTC4, and LTB4 production in murine macrophagesTXB26-keto-PGF1αLTC4LTB4Untreated12.95 ± 1.860.46 ± 0.041.29 ± 0.540.33 ± 0.0310 ng/ml TNFα7.91 ± 1.200.88 ± 0.510.717 ± 0.390.29 ± 0.110.1 mM dbcAMP16.93 ± 3.09*1.10 ± 0.801.74 ± 0.980.56 ± 0.05*TNFα + dbcAMP10.57 ± 0.831.95 ± 1.240.78 ± 0.460.71 ± 0.25Release of arachidonic acid metabolites was quantified in the supernatant as described in Fig. 1 and under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are expressed as picograms per microgram protein, and values represent the mean ± S.E. of 5 (TXB2), 4 (LTB4), and 3 (LTC4) different cultures or represent the mean ± variation of two independent experiments (6-keto-PGF1α). *, p < 0.05 compared with values of untreated.

In contrast to the effect of the cytokine on thromboxane, PGI2, or leukotrienes, TNFα had a dramatic inhibitory effect on the production of PGD2. Fig.3 A depicts the dose-dependent variations in PGE2 and PGD2 synthesis and release in response to increasing concentration of TNFα. Whereas unprimed macrophages, when stimulated with zymosan, synthesize and release high amounts of PGD2(22.89 pg ± 4.99 pg of PGD2/μg of total protein;n = 6), the release of PGE2 by these same cells remained at a low level (1.75 pg ± 0.34 pg/μg). However, when cells were incubated for a 16-h period with increasing concentration of TNFα (0.01 to 100 ng/ml), a simultaneous decrease in PGD2 release and increase in PGE2 production was observed that dropped to 7.5 ± 0.88 pg/μg and increased to 10.33 ± 0.3 pg/μg, respectively (at 10 ng/ml TNFα). Interestingly, the overall amount of released prostaglandins (PGE2+PGD2) remained unchanged (15.2 pg/μg for no TNFα versus 15.5 with 10 ng/ml TNFα stimulation; Fig. 3 A). The same reciprocal pattern of prostaglandin production was seen when cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 16 h and then stimulated for 1 h with 10 μmexogenous AA instead of zymosan (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that the role of zymosan is to stimulate PLA2, thus generating the AA, and that the effects of TNFα are downstream of this step. All together, the results shown in Fig. 3 suggest that TNFα might act by switching the synthesis of prostaglandins from the PGD2 to the PGE2 pathway. To further investigate the molecular basis involved in the regulation of PGE2 and PGD2 synthesis in murine macrophages, cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα alone or in combination with 0.1 mmdbcAMP in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml cycloheximide or 0.5 μg/ml actinomycin D. As illustrated in Fig.4, the observed increase in PGE2 production after stimulation of cells with TNFα alone or in combination with dbcAMP was completely abolished by either cycloheximide or actinomycin D, suggesting an absolute requirement for both RNA and protein synthesis. In contrast, neither cycloheximide nor actinomycin D prevented the inhibition of PGD2 production by TNFα. Interestingly, only cycloheximide but not actinomycin D inhibited basal PGD2 levels. These results suggest that, unlike the TNFα+dbcAMP-mediated induction of PGE2synthesis, basal production of PGD2 does not require new RNA synthesis. The observed decrease in PGD2 synthesis following cycloheximide treatment might reflect the turnover of constitutive enzyme(s) involved in the basal production of this prostaglandin. Since protein and RNA synthesis were involved in the enhanced production of PGE2by the combination of TNFα+dbcAMP and because basal production of PGD2 was dependent of protein synthesis, we next examined steady state mRNA levels of the constitutive (COX1) and the inducible form (COX2) of cyclooxygenase. Messenger RNA levels were analyzed by Northern blot after a 12-h stimulation period, and hybridization with a GAPDH cDNA probe was performed to ensure for equal loading of total RNA. As shown in Fig.5, COX1 mRNA was constitutively expressed in control macrophages while COX2 mRNA level remained undetectable. Neither 1 μm PGE2 nor 0.1 mm dbcAMP affected the expression of either COX1 or COX2, whereas 10 ng/ml TNFα inhibited the basal expression of COX1 mRNA and seemed to slightly increase COX2 mRNA levels. When cells were incubated with the combination TNFα+PGE2 or dbcAMP, elevation in COX2 mRNA levels was observed. The TNFα-induced inhibition of COX1 mRNA expression was not significantly altered by the presence of PGE2 or dbcAMP. As seen in Fig.6, Western blot analysis of macrophage whole cell lysates using specific monoclonal antibodies for COX1 and COX2 showed that the COX2 protein levels paralleled those of the transcript. The low content of COX2 protein in untreated cells was not affected by any of the stimuli used alone but was enhanced when cells were incubated with the combination of TNFα+dbcAMP. In contrast, the basal expression of COX1 protein remained unchanged in response to any of the treatments. Although the TNFα-induced down-regulation of COX1 mRNA levels was observed at 12 h, no significant change in the corresponding protein was seen after 18 h. This latter observation suggests that the constitutive form of COX may be relatively stable so that protein levels were not yet affected at 18 h despite the absence of transcript at 12 h.Figure 6Anti-COX2 and anti-COX1 immunoblots of macrophage lysates. Macrophage whole cell lysates after a 16-h stimulation period were probed with monoclonal antibodies for COX1 and COX2. Comparison to a protein ladder and to the migration of pure protein (standard) identify immunoreactive COX1 and COX2. As described by others (58Sirois J. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6382-6388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), murine COX2 migrates as two bands, the lower band resulting from inefficient N-glycosylation that has no effects on enzyme activity. This Western blot is representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further characterize which COX isozyme was involved in the up-regulated synthesis of PGE2, inhibitors of COX1 and/or COX2 activities were used.

The purpose of these experiments was to investigate potential upstream signaling events activated during heat shock in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Experiments were designed to ask whether heat shock activates p60 c-Src tyrosine kinase or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase). Using in vitro protein kinase activity assays, it was demonstrated that heat shock stimulates c-Src and PI 3-kinase activity in a time-dependent manner. Also, there was increased PI 3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-c-Src immunoprecipitated immunocomplexes from heated cells. Heat shock activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p70 S6 kinase (S6K) in these cells. The role of PI 3-kinase in regulating heat shock activation of MAPK and p70 S6K was investigated using wortmannin, a specific pharmacological inhibitor of PI 3-kinase. The results demonstrated that wortmannin inhibited heat shock activation of p70 S6K but only partially inhibited heat activation of MAPK. A dominant negative Raf mutant inhibited activation of MAPK by heat shock but did not inhibit heat shock stimulation of p70 S6K. Genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and suramin, a growth factor receptor inhibitor, both inhibited heat shock stimulation of MAPK activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK. Furthermore, a selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, tryphostin AG1478, and a dominant negative EGFR mutant also inhibited heat shock activation of MAPK. Heat shock induced EGFR phosphorylation. These results suggest that early upstream signaling events in response to heat stress may involve activation of PI 3-kinase and tyrosine kinases, such as c-Src, and a growth factor receptor, such as EGFR; activation of important downstream pathways, such as MAPK and p70 S6K, occur by divergent signaling mechanisms similar to growth factor stimulation.

The genes responsible for cellular responses to elevation of surrounding temperature are remarkably well conserved across all species from bacteria to mammals. In addition to elevated temperature, the induction of these genes and their encoded heat shock proteins is stimulated by other stressors, such as hypoxia or exposure to heavy metals, amino acid analogues, or viral infections. The production of heat shock proteins is thought to be a cellular protective response; these proteins act as molecular chaperones to facilitate folding and refolding of proteins denatured by environmental insults. Heat shock proteins have been implicated in a variety of medical conditions, from preservation of organs for transplantation, treatment of malignancies, or modulation of the immune system to the development of vaccines for infectious diseases (1Minowada G. Welch W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 3-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heat shock response has been intensively investigated in the effort to understand the regulation of heat shock gene transcription. In contrast, the molecular events by which the rise in temperature is transduced into cellular responses remain ill defined. There is increasing evidence that cellular stress responses are regulated by protein kinases, and indeed, heat shock activates a number of protein kinases, including p38/HOG1 kinase (2Rouse J.

Physiol. 1991; 148: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It is not known whether heat shock activates upstream signal molecules that regulate these downstream protein kinases. Selective activation of gene transcription and protein translation are clearly important for cells to orchestrate an adaptive response to heat stress. MAPK and p70 S6K are critical regulators of gene transcription and protein translation, respectively, during cellular growth. It is known that mitogenic activation of MAPK requires Ras and Raf proteins, but activation of p70 S6K is independent of Raf and is probably dependent on activation of PI 3-kinase (6Downward J. Nature. 1994; 371: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have investigated potential upstream signal events activated by heat shock and the signaling mechanisms that lead to heat shock activation of MAPK and p70 S6K in NIH3T3 cells. The results demonstrate that heat shock activates c-Src tyrosine kinase, PI 3-kinase, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In addition, the findings suggest that heat shock activates MAPK and p70 S6K via two distinct pathways. Myelin basic protein (MBP), H7, pertussis toxin, and genistein were purchased from Sigma; wortmannin was from Worthington Biochemical Co.

(Alabaster, AL); and tyrphostin AG1478 was from Calbiochem. All other reagents of molecular biology grade were obtained from standard commercial sources. NIH3T3 and A431 cells were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Prior to treatment with heat shock, cell culture media were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20 mm Hepes without bicarbonate at pH 7.4 for 1 h. Cell heating was done by incubating cells in a temperature-regulated circulating water bath. Cells were seeded into 60 mm dishes and transfected at ∼80% confluence. Transfection was performed in 3.0 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 15 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 6 μg of DNA. 5 h later, 3 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal bovine serum was added. 24 h after the start of transfection, the cells were washed and the medium was replaced with fresh medium. The next day, cells were made quiescent by serum starvation overnight prior to treatment. For stable transfections, cells were selected and maintained in a selective medium with 500 μg/ml of geneticin. After treatment, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were incubated with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 10 nm okadaic acid, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin) for 15 min on the ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The lysate was incubated with an appropriate antibody for 2 h and then with 20 μl of protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h. The beads containing the immunoprecipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer and once with a kinase reaction buffer and then subjected to kinase activity assays. Cell lysates were incubated with antibody against c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and immunoprecipitated as described above. The washed immunocomplexes were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 1 mm DTT, 40 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and a tyrosine kinase peptide substrate specific for Src-family kinases (cdc2:8-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by spotting an aliquot of the reaction mixture on phosphofilter paper, which was then washed extensively and radioactivity quantified by a scintillation counter. For autophosphorylation assays, the washed pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 1 mm DTT, 40 μmATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of loading buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. The mixture was then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Cell lysates (1–2 mg of protein) were incubated with antibodies (2 μg/mg of protein) against phosphotyrosine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), c-Src (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and immunoprecipitated as described above. Assay of PI 3-kinase activity was conducted as described (7Hu Z.-W. Shi X.-Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 8Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol.

Briefly, the washed pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EGTA) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min after addition of phosphatidylinositol dissolved in chloroform. Reactions were initiated with addition of 5 μl of ATP solution (0.4m ATP, 0.1 m MgCl2, and 1 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP) and continued at room temperature for 30 min. During this period, the formation of phosphatidylinositol phosphate was linear (data not shown). The reaction was stopped after the addition of 100 μl of chloroform/methanol/11.6 n HCl (100:200:2). Following centrifugation, the lower organic phase was taken and separated by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel plates developed in chloroform, methanol, 25% ammonium hydroxide, and water (43:38:5:7). The plates were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were lysed, incubated with antibody against ERK1 (2 μg/mg of protein), and immunoprecipitated as above. The assay of MAPK activity was performed following a method described previously (7Hu Z.-W. Shi X.-Y. Lin R.Z. Hoffman B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8977-8982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The washed immunocomplexes were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 1 mm DTT, 40 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 25 μg of MBP. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Either the reactions were stopped by the addition of loading buffer, after which the mixtures were boiled and separated by gel electrophoresis, and results were visualized by autoradiography, or an aliquot was spotted on phosphofilter paper, washed extensively, and then radioactivity counted by a scintillation counter. Cell lysates were prepared, and equal amounts of protein were suspended in loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, resolved by gel electrophoresis, and visualized by Western blotting using anti-phosphorylated MAPK antibodies that recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated p44 ERK1 and p42 ERK2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and an ECL detection system. The same membrane was then stripped and reblotted with an anti-ERK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were lysed and incubated with antibody against p70 S6K (2 μg/mg of protein, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and immunoprecipitated as above. The washed immunocomplexes were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 1 mm DTT, 40 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of ribosomal S6 kinase peptide substrate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by spotting an aliquot of the reaction mixture on phosphofilter paper and then washed extensively and radioactivity quantified by a scintillation counter. Cells were lysed and incubated with antibody against MAPKAPK-2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and immunoprecipitated as above. The washed immunocomplexes were resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer with 1 mm DTT, 40 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg of hsp25 as substrate (StressGen Biotechnologies, Sidney, Canada). The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding loading buffer and boiling for 5 min. The mixture was then separated by gel electrophoresis, and results were visualized by autoradiography. Cells were washed twice in cold PBS, and then RNA was extracted essentially as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (10Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63082) Google Scholar). Total RNA (20 μg) was fractionated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon filter. [32P]ATP labeled probes for hsp70 and β-actin were made by random primer labeling. After UV cross-linking, the filter was prehybridized in 50% formamide, 5 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA buffer, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 16–20 h at 42 °C. The filter was washed initially with 2 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS and then with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. The results were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Equal amounts of protein extracts (500 μg) from control and heat-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with an EGFR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR was visualized by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20; Transduction Laboratories) and an ECL detection system. The same membrane was then stripped and reblotted with the EGFR antibody to determine whether equal quantities of EGFR were immunoprecipitated. Heat shock greatly increases protein tyrosine phosphorylation (11Maher P.A. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell. Biol. 1989; 108: 2029-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Heat shock stimulation of MAPK activity correlates with increased phosphorylation of p42ERK2 and p44ERK1 MAPKs (4Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We speculated that heat stress may activate upstream tyrosine kinases, which would then lead to phosphorylation of downstream protein kinases, such as MAPK. Src-family kinases have been implicated in signaling pathway of the UV stress response (12Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). We wondered whether heat shock may also activate c-Src. Using a Src-specific peptide substrate, c-Src activity was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” We found that heat stress at 43 °C increased c-Src activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). An in vitroautophosphorylation assay confirmed that heat shock increased c-Src activity (Fig. 1 B). Activation of Src-family tyrosine kinases may recruit binding of PI 3-kinase to the SRC homology 2 domain and stimulate PI 3-kinase activity (13Rudd C.E. Janssen O. Prasad K.V. Raab M. da Silva A. Telfer J.C. Yamamoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 239-266PubMed Google Scholar). We wondered whether heat shock activation of c-Src in NIH3T3 cells was associated with activation of PI 3-kinase. In the first series of experiments, a general anti-phosphotyrosine antibody was used to immunoprecipitate cell lysates harvested following 5 min of heating because this time was the peak of activation of c-Src by heat shock (Fig. 1 A). Heat shock greatly increased PI 3-kinase activity in these immunocomplexes (Fig.2). There was also increased PI 3-kinase activity when lysates from heated cells were immunoprecipitated with a specific c-Src antibody (Fig. 2). To confirm that heat shock activates PI 3-kinase, an antibody against the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase was used to immunoprecipitate PI 3-kinase; we found that there was increased PI 3-kinase activity in these immunocomplexes (Fig.3).Figure 3Heat shock activation of PI 3-kinase activity. Cells were heated for indicated times. Cell lysates (2 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the p85α subunit of PI 3-kinase. PI 3-kinase activity was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Change in activity of PI 3-kinase is presented as production of phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP). The figure is a representative autoradiogram of the thin layer chromatography plate used in the experiment. Experiments were repeated three times, and the change in PI 3-kinase activity quantitated by a PhosphorImager. The increases above basal activity at 2, 5, and 10 min of heating at 43 °C were 26 ± 5.2, 120 ± 5.6, and 56 ± 3.5%, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The heat shock response requires coordination of changes in transcriptional and translational rates of specific genes and proteins. For example, MAPK is a critical regulator of transcription, and p70 S6K has been shown to be important for protein synthesis. Heat shock activates MAPK and p70 S6K (4Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Jurivich D.A. Chung J. Blenis J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 148: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To determine whether PI 3-kinase regulates these important downstream signaling molecules during heat shock, we used wortmannin to specifically inhibit PI 3-kinase. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of wortmannin prior to heat stress and harvested to measure p70 S6K activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” Wortmannin inhibited the increase in p70 S6K activity in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of ∼10 nm (Fig.4 A). We next asked whether wortmannin also inhibited heat shock stimulation of MAPK. Much higher concentrations of wortmannin were required to inhibit heat-induced MAPK activity; there was approximately a 50% inhibition of MAPK activity at a wortmannin concentration of 100 nm (Fig. 4 B). At this high concentration, wortmannin may have other effects, such as inhibition of myosin light chain kinase, so that its effects cannot be considered specific. It has been previously shown that heat stress also leads to phosphorylation of hsp25 by MAPKAPK-2 (14Engel K. Ahlers A. Brach M.A. Herrmann F. Gaestel M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We confirmed that observation and demonstrated that pretreatment with 100 nmwortmannin did not inhibit MAPKAPK-2-induced phosphorylation of hsp25 after heat shock (Fig. 4 C). Genistein inhibits tyrosine kinase activity in proteins such as c-Src and EGF receptors. To determine whether tyrosine kinases are involved in the activation of MAPK during heat shock, cells were pretreated with genistein for 1 h; the results demonstrated complete inhibition of heat shock activation of MAPK (Fig.5 A). Wortmannin had a partial inhibitory effect. (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, H7 (a protein kinase C inhibitor) had no effect on heat activation of MAPK. Down-regulation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters also did not inhibit heat shock activation of MAPK (data not shown). MAPKs are activated when they are phosphorylated at tyrosine and threonine residues. Using an anti-phosphostyrosine MAPK antibody, we confirmed that genistein inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK by heat shock (Fig. 5 B). The change in the extent of phosphorylation was not due to differential loading of proteins, as shown by Western blots with an anti-ERK1 antibody (Fig. 5 C). Further studies were done to investigate whether heat shock activation of MAPK and p70 S6K occurs by distinct signaling pathways. Growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, activate p70 S6K without requiring Raf because overexpression of a dominant negative Raf mutant does not inhibit platelet-derived growth factor-induced activation of p70 S6K (15Ming X.F. Burgering B.M. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we expressed a dominant negative Raf mutant (NΔRaf, a gift from L. T. Williams) that contains only amino-terminal amino acid residues 1-257 of Raf1 without the kinase domain (16Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Koch W.J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17148-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). NΔRaf inhibited heat shock stimulation of MAPK activity (Fig. 6 A) and tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPKs (Fig. 6 B). However, the expression of NΔRaf did not inhibit heat-induced activation of p70 S6K activity, as measured using aliquots obtained from the same transfection experiments (Fig. 6 C). Heat shock activation of MAPK and p70 S6K appears to use signaling pathways reminiscent of those activated by growth factors. The surprising result that EGF receptors are involved in the cellular responses to UV irradiation suggests that growth factor receptors may play an important role in the signal transduction of stress responses (17Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M. Peppelenbosch M.P. Bos J.L. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the hypothesis that growth factor receptors may also be involved in the heat shock response. Suramin is an extracellular antagonist of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and may also inhibit other tyrosine kinase receptors (18Betsholtz C. Johnsson A. Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6440-6444Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 300 μm suramin for 30 min prior to heat shock and assayed for MAPK activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK in response to heat shock. We found that suramin inhibited heat activation of MAPK (Fig. 7, Aand B). We also found that treatment of cells with suramin prior to heat shock partially inhibited heat shock-stimulated hsp70 mRNA accumulation (Fig. 7 C). To determine whether tyrosine kinases may have a role in regulating expression of heat shock protein mRNA, cells were pretreated with protein kinase inhibitors 2-aminopurine or genistein; both compounds completely inhibited heat shock induction of hsp70 expression in Northern blotting experiments. Heat shock induction of hsp70 mRNA expression was also partially inhibited by pretreatment with 100 nm wortmannin, although this may not be a specific effect of wortmannin (Fig. 7 C). Because the results from experiments with suramin suggest that growth factor receptor may be involved in the heat shock response, we investigated the possibility that heat treatment may cause cells to release growth factors into the medium. NIH3T3 cells were made quiescent in serum-free medium (overnight). The conditioned media from heat-treated (43 °C 30 min) were transferred to untreated but quiescent cells. Cells were incubated with the conditioned media for 2–30 min and then assayed for MAPK activity by immunocomplex kinase assay. We found that conditioned media from heat-treated cells did not induce an increase in MAPK activity (data not shown). Although the experiments with conditioned media did not support the hypothesis that heat shock causes release of growth factors, there is increasing evidence that cellular stresses such as UV irradiation utilize growth factor receptors as a component of their cellular signaling (19Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The EGFR appears to play a particularly important role in this intracellular signal cross-talk. Therefore, experiments were designed to investigate the hypothesis that EGFR may play a role in the heat shock activation of downstream signaling events. Tryphostin AG1478 is a selective EGFR inhibitor that inactivates the EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (20Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated with AG1478 for 1 h prior to heat treatment at 43 °C for 30 min. MAPK activation was monitored by Western blots using a specific antibody against anti-phosphotyrosine MAPK antibody as described earlier. MAPKAPK-2 activation was detected using an immunocomplex kinase assay also described previously. We found that AG1478 completely inhibited heat shock activation of MAPK even more effectively than suramin (Fig.8 A). Although AG1478 minimally inhibited heat induction of MAPKAPK-2 activity, this is probably due to an nonspecific effect of AG1478 because stress activation of the p38/MAPKAPK-2 pathway is thought to be in a separate pathway from the MAPK pathway. Not surprisingly, suramin also did not block heat shock activation of MAPKAPK-2 (Fig. 8 B). To test the hypothesis that EGFR is involved in the heat shock activation of MAPK, NIH3T3 cells were stably transfected with a dominant negative EGFR mutant and wild-type human EGFR (HERCD533 and HER1, respectively; gifts from A. Ullrich). The HERCD533 mutant lacks the cytoplasmic kinase domain and therefore inhibits EGFR downstream signaling by formation of signaling-defective heterodimers with the wild-type receptor (20Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells expressing HERCD533 when heat shocked had attenuated MAPK activation compared with wild-type cells and with cells stably transfected with HER1 (Fig. 8 C). This result suggests that EGFR plays an important role in heat shock activation of downstream intracellular events. Upon activation, EGFR is tyrosine autophosphorylated at tyrosine residues. To determine whether heat shock activates EGFR, we used A431 cells, which express high levels of endogenous EGFR. Equal amounts of protein extracts from control and heat-shocked A431 cells were immunoprecipitated with an EGFR antibody, and then tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFRs was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” We found that heating cells at 43 °C for 30 min strongly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig.9), although to a lesser extent than stimulation with EGF (100 ng/ml) (data not shown). Preincubation of the cells with an EGF neutralizing antibody did not inhibit heat shock-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR but completely blocked EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation (data not shown). The heat shock response is a rapid, highly regulated adaptive response to stress, and it involves coordinate control of multiple signal transduction pathways. The complexity of the cellular heat shock response is quite apparent, and heat shock activates multiple kinase (JNK/SAPK, p38/HOG1, and ERKs) cascades. However, some of the earliest signal transduction events after heat shock appear to occur near the cell membrane. We demonstrated that heat shock activates c-Src, a kinase known to be anchored to the inner surface of cell membrane by a amino-terminal myristic acid moiety (13Rudd C.E. Janssen O. Prasad K.V. Raab M. da Silva A. Telfer J.C. Yamamoto M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 239-266PubMed Google Scholar). Heat shock activation of c-Src is a relatively early event and is probably associated with activation of PI 3-kinase as indicated by our result showing increased PI 3-kinase activity in anti-c-Src immunocomplexes. Like Src family kinases, PI 3-kinase is located near the cell membrane and is associated with other signal molecules through its SRC homology 2 and SH3 domains (21Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Heat shock activation of PI 3-kinase may involve other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins because there is increased PI 3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunocomplexes. One possible candidate may be receptor tyrosine kinases. This hypothesis is supported by our results indicating that the signal pathways used by heat shock to activate MAPK and p70 S6 kinase resemble those used by growth factors, and heat shock activation of MAPK is blocked by suramin. Protein perturbation caused by hyperthermia may in some way stimulate cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases to initiate the downstream signaling events. Indeed, inhibition of heat shock activation MAPK by tryphostin AG1478 and a dominant negative EGFR mutant strongly suggests that EGFR may be involved in the heat shock response. These results are reminiscent of other cellular stress responses, such as UV and oxidative stress, both of which stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR (22Sachsenmaier C. Radler-Pohl A. Zinck R. Nordheim A. Herrlich P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Cell. 1994; 78: 963-972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 23Rao G.N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 713-719PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that EGFR is involved in the heat shock response, we used A431 cells, which express high levels of EGFR compared with NIH3T3 cells, to determine whether heat stress induces tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. Our results indicate that heat shock strongly induces tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. The results of the experiments using suramin to inhibit heat shock activation of MAPK are compatible with the possibility that heat shock may induce cells to release EGF into the medium. However, the conditioned media from heat-treated cells did not induce an increase in MAPK activity, and pretreatment of cells with an neutralizing antibody against EGFR also did not block heat shock-induced phosphorylation of EGFR but, as expected, inhibited EGF-induced receptor phosphorylation. These results suggest that EGF is not being released by the heat-stressed cell, leading to activation of EGFR and MAPK in an autocrine fashion. In NIH3T3 cells, EGFR activation does not lead to activation of PI 3-kinase (24Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), but Src can activate PI 3-kinase (21Fry M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1226: 237-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and phosphorylate EGFR (25Fedi P. Pierce J.H. di Fiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the initial event in the heat shock response is Src activation, which leads to phosphorylation of EGFR and activation of MAPK; via a separate pathway, it also leads to activation of PI 3-kinase and subsequent activation of p70 S6 kinase. Further investigation is need to clarify the possible interactions between activation of Src, EGFR, and PI 3-kinase following heat shock. The role of p70 S6 kinase during heat shock is unclear; however, regulation of protein synthesis is obviously important during the heat shock response because there is a general shutdown of protein synthesis but a selective increased production of heat shock proteins. Heat shock activation of p70 S6 kinase is probably via PI 3-kinase because it was highly sensitive to wortmannin inhibition. This result is consistent with findings that growth factor activation of p70 S6 kinase is also via PI 3-kinase (15Ming X.F. Burgering B.M. Wennstrom S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase has also been implicated in regulation of cytoskeletal changes via a separate pathway from p70 S6 kinase (6Downward J. Nature. 1994; 371: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cellular stress, including heat shock, also activates a distinct stress pathway, leading to stimulation of p38 kinase, which activates MAPKAPK-2, which subsequently phosphorylates hsp25 (14Engel K. Ahlers A. Brach M.A. Herrmann F. Gaestel M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 57: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The role of phosphorylated hsp25 is controversial; it may have cellular protective effects by preventing stress-induced cytoskeletal damages (26Huot J. Houle F. Spitz D.R. Landry J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that heat shock activation of MAPKAPK-2 is insensitive to wortmannin shows that this is in a separate signal pathway from those used by heat shock to activate p70 S6 kinase. The key regulatory event in initiating transcription of heat shock genes is binding of a heat shock transcription factor (HSF-1) to a heat shock consensus element found in the promoters of all heat shock genes (27Lis J. Wu C. Cell. 1993; 74: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Heat shock activates HSF-1 by promoting its trimerization, nuclear localization, and increased DNA binding capacity (28Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Studies have indicated that binding of HSF1 to the heat shock consensus element is not sufficient for full transcription of heat shock genes, and other regulatory events involving protein phosphorylation appear to play a role (29Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3365-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Heat shock induces hyperphosphorylation of HSF-1, but the protein kinases that are involved in phosphorylating HSF-1 are yet to be identified. Our data confirm that protein kinases play an important role in regulating expression of heat shock protein because the protein kinase inhibitors genistein and 2-aminopurine completely inhibited heat shock induction of hsp70 mRNA expression. Chu et al.(30Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) showed that MAPK, in conjunction with glycogen synthase kinase 3, phosphorylates heat shock factor-1 and represses transcriptional activation of the heat shock protein 70 promoter. This result suggest that MAPK may serve as a negative regulator of heat shock protein production and deactivate the heat shock response during recovery from stress. Activation of MAPK appears to play a protective role during cellular stress. Oxidative stress activates MAPK, and inhibition of MAPK activation decreases cell survival after oxidative stress (31Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). It is possible that activation of MAPK by heat shock may have similar protective effects in this setting. Further studies will be required to clarify how activation of signal pathways at the cell membrane surface interact with the key regulatory events occurring in the nucleus during heat shock. It will also be important to determine the physiological role of the MAPK and p70 S6 kinase in the heat shock response. Investigations in this area will lead to a better understanding of this fundamental and fascinating cellular response to cellular stress. HERCD533 and HER1 were gifts from A. Ullrich (Max Planck Institute), and NΔRaf was a gift from L. T. Williams (University of California, San Francisco)."
https://openalex.org/W2107180729,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are highly conserved ∼20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin and are believed to participate in vesicular transport in both exocytic and endocytic pathways. Several ARF-like proteins (ARLs) have been cloned fromDrosophila, rat, and human; however, the biological functions of ARLs are unknown. We have identified a yeast gene (ARL1) encoding a protein that is structurally related (>60% identical) to human, rat, and Drosophila ARL1. Biochemical analyses of purified recombinant yeast ARL1 (yARL1) protein revealed properties similar to those ARF and ARL1 proteins, including the ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP. Like other ARLs, recombinant yARL1 protein did not stimulate cholera toxin-catalyzed auto-ADP-ribosylation. yARL1 was not recognized by antibodies against mammalian ARLs or yeast ARFs. Anti-yARL1 antibodies did not cross-react with yeast ARFs, but did react with human ARLs. On subcellular fractionation, yARL1, similar to yARF1, was localized to the soluble fraction. The amino terminus of yARL1, like that of ARF, was myristoylated. Unlike Drosophila Arl1, yeastARL1 was not essential for cell viability. Like rat ARL1, yARL1 might be associated in part with the Golgi complex. However, yARL1 was not required for endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi protein transport, and it may offer an opportunity to define an ARL function in another kind of vesicular trafficking, such as the regulated secretory pathway. ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are highly conserved ∼20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that enhance the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin and are believed to participate in vesicular transport in both exocytic and endocytic pathways. Several ARF-like proteins (ARLs) have been cloned fromDrosophila, rat, and human; however, the biological functions of ARLs are unknown. We have identified a yeast gene (ARL1) encoding a protein that is structurally related (>60% identical) to human, rat, and Drosophila ARL1. Biochemical analyses of purified recombinant yeast ARL1 (yARL1) protein revealed properties similar to those ARF and ARL1 proteins, including the ability to bind and hydrolyze GTP. Like other ARLs, recombinant yARL1 protein did not stimulate cholera toxin-catalyzed auto-ADP-ribosylation. yARL1 was not recognized by antibodies against mammalian ARLs or yeast ARFs. Anti-yARL1 antibodies did not cross-react with yeast ARFs, but did react with human ARLs. On subcellular fractionation, yARL1, similar to yARF1, was localized to the soluble fraction. The amino terminus of yARL1, like that of ARF, was myristoylated. Unlike Drosophila Arl1, yeastARL1 was not essential for cell viability. Like rat ARL1, yARL1 might be associated in part with the Golgi complex. However, yARL1 was not required for endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi protein transport, and it may offer an opportunity to define an ARL function in another kind of vesicular trafficking, such as the regulated secretory pathway.

It seemed likely that mammalian ARFs should have different functions and intracellular localizations. Consistent with this view, ARF1, ARF3, and ARF5 differed in their binding to the Golgi apparatus (24Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Haun R.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The products of these genes do not appear to activate cholera toxin and differ in GTP binding requirements (dependence on magnesium and phospholipids) from ARF isoforms. Although some of these proteins exhibit tissue- and/or differentiation-specific expression, the biological functions of ARLs remain unknown. To determine whether ARLs are also present in Saccharomyces, where their functions might perhaps be more readily defined, we isolated by polymerase chain reaction a new ARL cDNA from a yeast library. This report describes the genetic, molecular, and biochemical characterization of the yeast homologue (yARL1) of mammalian andDrosophila ARL1. yARL1 is not required for ER-to-Golgi protein transport. Unlike Drosophila ARL1, yARL1 is not essential for cell viability. Yeast culture media were prepared as described by Sherman et al. (44Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). YPD and YPGal contained 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose or 2% galactose, respectively; SD contained 0.7% Difco yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids) and 2% glucose. Nutrients essential for auxotrophic strains were supplied at specified concentrations (44Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics.

Unless otherwise specified, the protocol used for PCR amplification was 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by extension at 72 °C for 10 min, in a solution containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 20 mm each dNTP, 0.1% Tween, 25 pmol of each amplification primer, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (total volume of 100 ml). Samples of reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis o a 1.5% agarose gel. All PCR products were purified, subcloned, and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (48Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). DNA sequences were analyzed, and multiple protein alignments were prepared using a GeneWorks software package (IntelliGenetics, Inc./Betagen, Mountain View, CA). Yeast ARL1 was isolated initially by PCRs from a yeast λgt11 cDNA library. Five PCRs were used to obtain cDNA segments and to assemble a composite sequence of the full-length coding region. Primers 1222 (5′-TTGACACCAGACCAACTGGTAATG-3′), 1222B (5′-ACCGGCGCTCAGCTGGAATT-3′), 1218 (5′-GGTGGCGACGACTCCTGGAGCCCG-3′), and 1218A (5′-CGTCAGTATCGGCGGAATTC-3′) are complementary to sequences immediately upstream or downstream of the EcoRI insertion site of vector λgt11. Degenerate nucleotides (ARL1-R1 and ARL1-R2) correspond to part of the consensus sequences VWDLGGQD and TSIRPYWR in human, rat, and Drosophila ARL1. The open reading frame was completed using the rapid amplification of 5′-cDNA ends procedure (49Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4314) Google Scholar). A yeast λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) served as template in the one site-specific PCR used to capture 3′- and 5′-ends as described previously (10Lee F.-J.S. Stevens L.A. Hall L.M. Murtagh Jr., J.J.

The yeastURA3 gene was inserted at the single EcoNI site in the yeast ARL1 gene as follows (see Fig. 4 A). The 3.8-kb DNA fragment containing the yeast URA3 gene and two hisG repeat sequences was excised from the plasmid pNKY51 (50Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 116: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) by digestion with BglII and BamHI; the 5′-overhangs were filled in with Klenow fragment. Plasmid pGyL1, containing the yeast ARL1 gene, was linearized at the internal EcoNI site; the overhang ends were filled in with Klenow fragment, and the cDNA was ligated to the 3.8-kbhisG-URA3-hisG fragment, resulting in pGyL1U. Gene disruption mutants were constructed by a one-step gene replacement method (51Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ∼4.8-kb DNA fragment excised from pGyL1U by digestion with XhoI and BamHI was used to transform various Ura − strains (see Table I), and uracil prototrophs were selected. DNA blot analysis of the URA+ cells confirmed that the yeast ARL1 gene contained an additional 3.8 kb, corresponding to thehisG-URA3-hisG gene. Elimination of URA3 and onehisG repeat was carried out as described previously (11Lee F.-J.S. Stevens L.A. Kao Y.L. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20931-20937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Double deletions of yeast ARL1 and yeast ARF3were performed in the yeast arl1 mutants (arl1::hisG, ura3) and arf3 mutants (arf3::hisG, ura3) that are listed in Table I. The open reading frame of yeast ARL1 was obtained by PCR using primers that incorporated unique NdeI and BamHI sites at the initiating methionine and 6 base pairs 3′ of the stop codon, respectively. For the His-tagged yARL1 fusion protein, a DNA fragment containing the yeast ARL1 coding region was generated by amplifying yeast genomic DNA with sequence-specific primers. The PCR product was purified and annealed to the expression vector pET15b (Novagen), yielding pET15byL1. For the nonfusion protein, PCR products were digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified, and annealed to the expression vector pT7 (52Haun R.S. Moss J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), yielding pT7yARL1. BL21(DE3) cells containing expression plasmids were grown to a density of A 600 = 1.0, at which time the inducer, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 1 mm EDTA, and stored at −80 °C until used. For large-scale production of recombinant proteins, 5 ml of overnight culture were used to inoculate 1 liter of LB broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), followed by shaking at 37 °C. WhenA 600 reached 0.6–0.8, protein production was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h, and bacteria were collected by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. Cell pellets were suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml) and disrupted by sonification. The lysate was centrifuged after the addition of Triton X-100 to 1%, and His-tagged fusion protein was isolated on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) by standard methods. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue. Protein was quantified by Coomassie Blue or silver stain assays (Bio-Rad). The recombinant N-terminal His-tagged fusion proteins (yARL1, yARF1, yARF3, yARP1, hARL1, hARL2, hARL3, mouse ARL4, hARL5, and carboxypeptidase Y) were synthesized inEscherichia coli using the pET15b expression plasmid, isolated on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, and further purified by SDS-PAGE. Denatured purified proteins from the SDS-PAGE gel were used as antigens to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits essentially as described (53Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Yeast cell concentration was assessed by absorbance at 600 nm; cells were suspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) to a final A 600 of 30. Whole cell extracts were then prepared by vortexing with glass beads for 2 min at 4 °C and clarified by a brief centrifugation. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). Incubation with antibodies was carried out in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% dried skim milk at room temperature for 60 min. The monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA.11, Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM (H + L) were each diluted 1:1000. Bound antibodies were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primary and secondary antibodies and luminol substrate were removed from the blot using the blot-stripping protocol (Amersham Corp.). The 3′-end of the yARL1 cDNA was altered so that the encoded protein contained the sequence 183-YPYDVPDYA*-192 at its extreme C terminus (the sequence of the HA epitope is underlined, and the asterisk indicates the stop codon). The yeast HA-tagged ARL1 gene was subcloned into the pVT101U plasmid, an expression plasmid containing the ADH1 promoter (54Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), as a XhoI-XbaI fragment into XhoI-XbaI sites to yield pVT101yL1HA. For expression of myristoylated ARL1, competent BL21(DE3) bacteria (Novagen) were transformed with expression plasmids (pT7/yARL1, pT7/yARF1, pT7/hARL1, or pET15b/yARL1) and selected for ampicillin resistance. Yeast (S. cerevisiae) N-myristoyltransferase expression was obtained in BL21(DE3) cells using the plasmid pACYC177/ET3d/yNMT (55Haun R.S. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7064-7068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To produce myristoylated proteins, strain BL21(DE3) competent bacteria were transformed with two expression plasmids and selected for both ampicillin and kanamycin resistance. [9,10-3H]Myristic acid (1 mCi/ml, in ethanol; Amersham Corp.) was added to a final concentration of 30 μCi/ml, and the cultures were shaken at 30 °C. After cultures reached anA 600 of ∼0.6, 10 μl of 100 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside were added. Cultures were grown for an additional 3 h, bacteria were collected by centrifugation, and the pellets were frozen at −20 °C. To synthesize 3H-labeled myristoylated yARL1 in yeast, [3H]myristic acid was added to yeast culture as described by Simon and Aderem (56Simon S.M. Aderem A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3922-3931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cells were grown to a density of 2 × 107 cells/ml at 25 °C in a rotary air shaker, harvested by centrifugation, and suspended at a density of 2 × 108 cells/ml. Cerulenin (10 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added to a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. After 10 min, [3H]myristic acid was added to a final concentration of 30 μCi/ml, and cells were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in a rotary shaker. Cells were collected and washed with 10 mmNaN3 in double distilled H2O. Glass beads (300 ml) and 300 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added, and the mixture was agitated vigorously for 90 s at room temperature before immersion in a boiling water bath for 6 min. Immunoprecipitation, electrophoresis, and autoradiography were done essentially as described (57Stirling C.J. Rothblatt J.A. Hosobuchi M. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) using 10 μl of anti-yARL1 or anti-yARF1 serum prepared in our laboratory. Yeast cells were grown at 24 °C overnight in selective minimal medium containing 200 mm (NH4)2SO4 to anA 600 of 0.5. After 1 h at 37 °C, cells were transferred to sulfate-free selective minimal medium (finalA 600 = 5) and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before the addition of 30 μCi of Pro-mixl-[35S]-label (blend of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, 14.3 mCi/ml) per A 600 unit. After 5 min, labeling was terminated by the addition of 1% (v/v) chase solution (0.3% (w/v) cysteine, 0.4% (w/v) methionine, and 100 mm(NH4)2SO4). Samples were removed at the indicated times thereafter and added to equal volumes of ice-cold 20 mm NaN3 in double distilled"
https://openalex.org/W1992502548,"The δ and b subunits are both involved in binding the F1 to the F0 part in theEscherichia coli ATP synthase (ECF1F0). The interaction of the purified δ subunit and the isolated hydrophilic domain of the b subunit (bsol) has been studied here. Purified δ binds to bsol weakly in solution, as indicated by NMR studies and protease protection experiments. On F1,i.e. in the presence of ECF1-δ, δ, and bsol interact strongly, and a complex of ECF1·bsol can be isolated by native gel electrophoresis. Both δ subunit and bsol are protected from trypsin cleavage in this complex. In contrast, the δ subunit is rapidly degraded by the protease when bound to ECF1 when bsol is absent. The interaction of bsol with ECF1 involves the C-terminal domain of δ as δ(1–134) cannot replace intact δ in the binding experiments.As purified, bsol is a stable dimer with 80% α helix. A monomeric form of bsol can be obtained by introducing the mutation A128D (Howitt, S. M., Rodgers, A. J.,W., Jeffrey, P. D., and Cox, G. B. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 7038–7042). Monomeric bsol has less α helix,i.e. only 58%, is much more sensitive to trypsin cleavage than dimer, and unfolds at much lower temperatures than the dimer in circular dichroism melting studies, indicating a less stable structure. The bsol dimer, but not monomer, binds to δ in ECF1.To examine whether subunit b is a monomor or dimer in intact ECF1F0, CuCl2 was used to induce cross-link formation in the mutants bS60C, bQ104C, bA128C, bG131C, and bS146C. With the exception of bS60C, CuCl2 treatment resulted in formation of b subunit dimers in all mutants. Cross-linking yield was independent of nucleotide conditions and did not affect ATPase activity. These results show the b subunit to be dimeric for a large portion of the C terminus, with residues 124–131 likely forming a pair of parallel α helices.

An F1F0 type ATPase is located in mitochondrial, chloroplast, and bacterial membranes, where it catalyzes the terminal step in oxidative- and photo-phosphorylation. InEscherichia coli, the enzyme contains five different subunits in the F1 part, α, β, γ, δ, and ε, in the stoichiometry 3:3:1:1:1, and three different subunits in the F0 part, a, b and c, in the ratio 1:2:9–12. The F1 part contains three catalytic sites on β subunits and is an ATPase when released from the F0, while the F0 part forms a proton pore (1Senior A.E. Physiol.

It is now generally accepted that the F1 and F0parts are joined by a relatively narrow stalk of 40–45 Å in length (4Gogol E.P. Lücken U. Capaldi R.A.

Two other subunits, δ of the F1 part and the two copies of the b subunit of the F0 part, are also involved in binding the F1 to the F0 (7Perlin D.S. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 236: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 8Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4020-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). They do not appear to be a part of the main stalk, and it has been suggested that they form a second connection, a stator that fixes the α3β3 subdomain to the a subunit to allow rotation of a γ-ε-c subunit subdomain during functioning (9Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have recently obtained a structure for a major part of the δ subunit by NMR (9Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The polypeptide forms two domains. The N-terminal domain, composed of residues 1–105, is a six-helix bundle. The C-terminal domain of residues 106–176 contains at least one α helix (residues 118–129), which can pack into a cleft in the N-terminal part, but this domain is partly unfolded in the isolated δ subunit.

How the b subunits are arranged in ECF1F0 is less well understood. The b subunits of bacterial F1F0-ATPase, and the equivalent polypeptides in the mitochondrial enzyme, are characterized by an N-terminal membrane intercalated region and a large hydrophilic C-terminal domain (12Walker J.E.

The polypeptide produced by Howitt et al.(16Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol.

Both forms of the C-terminal domain, here called bsol as proposed by Dunn (15Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are highly soluble in aqueous buffer. Sedimentation velocity centrifugation and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies show that bsol is an elongated dimer with a high α-helical content (15Dunn S.D. J. Biol.

Recent mutational analysis has established that residues Val124, Ala128, and Gly131 lie on one face of an α helix formed by a conserved hydrophobic region (Val124 to Ala132) near the C terminus of the b subunit (16Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7038-7042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The mutation bG131D had previously been shown to allow assembly of the b subunit into the membrane but to prevent assembly of the whole F1F0·ATPase complex (17Jans D.A. Fimmel A.L. Langman L. James L.B. Downie J.A. Senior A.E. Ash G.R. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Replacement of Ala128 by Asp is now known to disrupt dimer formation: bsol with the mutation A128D is a stable monomer (16Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7038-7042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Whether the dimeric structure seen in bsol is representative of the structural organization of the b subunit in the F1F0 complex is not known. Here, we have explored the arrangement of δ and the b subunits in ECF1F0 in some detail. Clear evidence that the b subunit binds to F1 via the δ subunit is reported, and it is shown that the dimer is both required for, and represents, the arrangement of subunit b in the complex. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on an M13 mp18 clone containing the unc genes B, E,F and H on a 2356-base pairHindIII/EcoRI fragment, according to the method of Kunkel et al. (18Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Residues Ser60, Gln104, Ala128, Gly131, and Ser146 were replaced by Cys using the following oligonucleotides (sequence changes underlined): GCAAAGGCCTGCGCGACCGAC (bS60C), ATCGTGGCCTGTGCGCAGGCG (bQ104C), GCTATCCTGTGTGTTGCTGGCG (bA128C), GGCTGTTGCTTGCGCCGAGAAG (bG131C) and GCTGCTAACTGTGACATCGTG (bS146C). 909-base pairBsrGI/BssHII fragments carrying the mutateduncF genes were excised from the M13 mp18 replicative form and ligated into the vector pRA100 (described in Aggeler et al.

These plasmids were used to transform the unc − E. coli strain AN888 (20Gibson F. Downie J.A. Cox G.B. Radik J. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 728-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and CJ236 (New England Biolabs) were used in cloning and mutagenesis procedures. Bacterial strains used in the overexpression of glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins (16Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7038-7042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were grown in Luria broth supplemented with 33 mmglycerol. Wild-type and mutant (A128D) forms of bsol were purified as described previously (16Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7038-7042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), using glutathione-linked agarose resin and thrombin obtained from Sigma. Strains used for the preparation of F1F0-ATPase were grown in minimal medium with supplements (21Gibson F. Cox G.B. Downie J.A. Radik J. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. For the determination of the relative percentages of secondary structure, wild-type b subunit cytoplasmic domain (0.242 g/liter) and the corresponding mutant A128D (0.255 g/liter) were dissolved in 5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The concentration of protein was determined using amino acid analysis. The samples were placed in 0.1-mm path length cells at 20 °C, and spectra were acquired using a scan speed of 20 nm/min, response time of 1 s, bandwidth of 1 nm, and resolution of 0.5 nm. For each sample, 10 acquisitions were collected between 260 and 200 nm and co-added, and 50 acquisitions were collected between 200 and 182 nm and co-added. The two sets were concatenated and the spectrum of the buffer, collected in the same way, was subtracted. The raw data were converted to mean residue ellipticity ([θ]MRW) using a mean residue weight of 109.5 calculated from the amino acid sequence. Data were analyzed using the computer program VARSLC1 (22Johnson W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) to obtain estimates of the percentages of α helix, parallel and antiparallel β sheet, turns, and “other” structure. For the temperature dependence of unfolding, both wild-type cytoplasmic domain (0.21 g/liter) and the mutant A128D (0.114 g/liter) were placed in 1-mm path length cells. The cells were placed in the jacketed cell holder of the spectropolarimeter. The temperature in the cell was controlled through the Jasco software and a Neslab RTE-111 water bath. The water bath temperature was raised at a rate of 1 °C/min over the range 7 to 95 °C, and data were collected at 222 nm every 0.2 °C as a measure of the loss of α helix. Corrections for the difference in the temperature between the water bath and the cell were made based upon previous calibrations using a thermocouple probe placed in the cell. Plots of [θ]MRW at 222 nm were analyzed assuming a two-state transition between the native state and the unfolded state. The melting temperature, t m , was estimated using nonlinear regression of the plots with the following equation θt=θ0+at+[(θ∞+bt)−(θ0+at)] ×exp[d(t−tm]/{1+exp[d(t−tm)]}Equation 1 where the parameters θ0 and θ∞ are the starting and ending ellipticity values, respectively, aand b are the slopes of the initial and final linear parts of the plots, respectively, d is the dispersion of the data, and t is the temperature at a given ellipticity, θ t . The fitting program returned estimates of the values of the parameters (including t m ) ± the standard errors. ECF1F0 was isolated and reconstituted into egg-lecithin vesicles as described in Aggeler et al. (23Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ATP synthase-containing vesicles collected from the Sephadex G-50 column were pelleted by centrifugation for 1 h at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti60 rotor. The pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol and stored in liquid nitrogen. Prior to cross-linking experiments with CuCl2, the reducing agent was removed by pelleting the enzyme at 175,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.2 rotor. The sample was then washed twice by successive resuspension and centrifugation steps in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. Final resuspension was in the same buffer at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. Cross-linking was carried out at 22 °C for 2 h using concentrations of between 5 μm and 200 μm CuCl2. All cross-linking reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 mm EDTA, and ATPase activities (24Lötscher H.-R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) were measured with and without prior incubation of the samples with 20 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 22 °C. In experiments comparing cleavage patterns of wild-type and mutant bsol, these proteins (1 mg/ml) were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 m glucose. The ratio of trypsin to bsol (w/w) was 1:3000. The reaction, conducted at 13 °C, was stopped by adding 4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride from a freshly prepared stock solution. Trypsin cleavage products were analyzed using 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels prepared and run according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow (25Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequences of tryptic fragments excised from Coomassie stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels were determined by Dr. Denis Shaw, Australian National University, Canberra, after passive transfer from the gel pieces onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Experiments comparing cleavage of bsol, the δ subunit and ECF1, alone or in combination, were carried out in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol. In experiments comparing cleavage of bsol and ECF1 in the presence and absence of bsol, the ratio of trypsin to bsol (w/w) was 1:5000. In experiments comparing cleavage of bsol and δ in the presence and absence of bsol, the ratio of trypsin to bsol (w/w) was 1:300. These reactions were conducted at 22 °C and were stopped by adding 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The δ subunit and δ(1–134)were produced from pJCI kindly provided by Dr. Stanley Dunn (University of Western Ontario). Polypeptides were purified, and NMR spectra were obtained as described previously (9Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Atebrin fluorescence quenching activities were assayed as described by Hatch et al. (26Hatch L. Fimmel A.L. Gibson F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1141: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay from Pierce, with bovine serum albumin as a standard. F1-ATPase was prepared from membranes of strain AN1460 (27Downie J.A. Langman L. Cox G.B. Yanofsky C. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 8-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described by Coxet al. (28Cox G.B. Jans D.A. Gibson F. Langman L. Senior A.E. Fimmel A.L. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Stripped membranes were prepared from strain AN2840 (29Howitt S.M. Cox G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9799-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using the method described by Wise et al.(30Wise J.G. Duncan T.M. Latchney L.R. Cox D.N. Senior A.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The bsol used here was obtained by thrombin release from a fusion protein that includes glutathioneS-transferase at the N terminus (16Howitt S.M. Rodgers A.J.W. Jeffrey P.D. Cox G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7038-7042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It contains residues 25–156 with a Gly-Ser N-terminal extension. Both intact δ and δ(1–134) were obtained as described previously (9Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All of the isolated subunits and subunit fragments were pure, based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.1). Interactions between F1-δ, δ, δ(1–134), and bsolwere examined first by native gel electrophoresis. In a typical experiment, such as shown in Fig. 1 A, fractions were mixed and then electrophoresed through agarose. Protein was detected on the native gel by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Bands containing protein were excised, dissolved in SDS, and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 1 A, F1-δ, δ, δ(1–134), and bsol each migrated very differently based on the combination of size and charge, while complexes of F1-δ, F1 + δ, F1 + δ(1–134), and even F1 + δ + bsol migrated similarly. No complex formation was observed between bsol and either pure δ or δ(1–134) in native gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 A, lane IV). However, both δ and δ(1–134) bound to F1-δ to form a complex that was retained through the electrophoresis step (Fig. 1 A,lanes VII and IX). Moreover, a complex could be formed between F1-δ, δ, and bsol (Fig.1 A, lane VIII), but not between F1-δ and bsol (Fig. 1 A, lane VI), or between F1 + δ(1–134) + bsol (Fig. 1 A, lane X). These results indicate that bsol binds tightly only to F1when δ is present, and that the C-terminal 43 residues are important for this interaction. The native gel electrophoresis experiments rule out a strong interaction between δ and bsol in the absence of F1, but do not preclude that there was weak interaction between the two subunits that was destabilized by the electrophoresis step. We have recently reported a structure determination of the δ subunit by NMR (9Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All of the backbone resonances of residues 1–134 were assigned. As a second approach to examining interactions of δ and bsol in solution, pure 15N-labeled δ subunit was titrated with purified bsol, and the resonance broadening of the δ subunit spectrum was monitored. Many of the individual resonances of the δ subunit progressively disappeared as the ratio of bsol to δ was increased (Fig.2) as clearly evident for Ser23, Gly72, Gly83, and Asn86, four residues that are widely distributed in the N-terminal domain. These results indicate that an interaction occurs between the two polypeptides with a slow to intermediate rate of exchange between a free δ subunit and δ that is bound to bsol. The binding constant between δ and bsolfrom these NMR studies must be larger than 2 μm. This is consistent with the interaction between the two polypeptides being weaker in solution than on F1, where a binding affinity of 2 μm was estimated by Dunn (15Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disappearance of resonances, then, represents the lowing of the tumbling rate of the δ subunit by binding of bsol. The approach does not pinpoint the site of interaction, except that when the experiment was repeated with δ(1–134), there was significantly less broadening of resonances of the N-terminal part, as would be expected if the interaction between δ and bsol is mainly through the C-terminal 42 residues of the δ subunit. Other individual subunits of ECF1 failed to alter the NMR spectrum of the δ. Both the δ subunit and bsol are highly protease sensitive in pure form (shown for bsol in Fig.3 A). Moreover, the δ subunit is still highly protease-sensitive when bound to the core ECF1 (Fig. 3 C). However, as shown in Fig.3 B, when bsol is reacted with ECF1, both the δ subunit and bsol are protected from trypsin cleavage. These results confirm the role of the δ subunit in binding bsol. Fig. 3 E presents data for the trypsin cleavage of the δ·bsol complex formed in solution. It is evident that there is some protection from cleavage of both δ and bsol by complex formation, but this interaction is clearly weak as proteolysis still proceeds quite rapidly. To examine if bsol was binding to F1 at its functionally important site, the ability of the polypeptide to block the reconstitution of coupled F1F0 ATPase activity was measured by atebrin fluorescence quenching assays. In the absence of added bsol, rebinding of F1 to the membrane preparation gave ATP-dependent quenching that was 53% of the original fluorescence level (Fig.4 C) compared with 51% after preincubation of ECF1 with monomeric bsol at the same concentration (Fig. 4 B). When bsol was incubated with F1 and then the complex reconstituted, ATP-dependent quenching was only 12% of the original fluorescence level (Fig. 4 A). Thus, the binding of bsol blocks the functional rebinding of F1 to F0. A CD spectrum of the wild-type (dimeric) form of the bsolover the wavelength range 182–260 nm is presented in Fig.5 A. The data indicate 80% ± 3% (SD) α helix. The CD spectrum of the mutant (A128D) form of bsol is also shown in Fig. 5 A, from which 58 ± 2% α-helix was estimated. The loss of α-helical structure observed for the mutant protein is compensated largely by an increase in “other” (random coil) structure and parallel β sheet. The trypsin digestion patterns of the dimeric and monomeric forms of bsol are additional evidence of loss of secondary structure in the monomer. Thus, with trypsin to bsol at a ratio of 1:5000 (cf. 1:3000 in Fig. 3) as well as with 2m glucose present to stabilize the protein, there was only a single cut of bsol in 30 min, the product of which had the N-terminal sequence QKEIAD (cutting after residue Arg36). Under equivalent conditions, the monomeric protein was cleaved at Arg36, Arg49, Lys58, Arg83, and Lys100, indicating increased accessibility of the protease, not only in the vicinity of the mutation but at a number of points throughout the protein (results not shown). The increased susceptibility of monomeric bsol to proteolytic cleavage correlates with decreased thermal stability as shown by CD melting studies. CD scans at a fixed wavelength of 222 nm over the temperature range 6–82 °C (Fig. 5 B) showed a clear secondary structure transition with midpoint at 40 °C for the wild-type dimeric bsol. In this transition the polypeptide goes from a folded conformation to an unstructured state. The unfolding of the mutant monomeric bsol is centered at a significantly lower temperature (32 °C). The stability of the dimer, and importance of the dimer in binding to F1, supports the idea that b is a dimer in the ECF1F0 complex. To test this more directly, mutants were constructed in which a cysteine was introduced in place of the following b subunit residues, Ser60, Gln104, Ala128, Gly131, and Ser146. With the exception of the mutant bS60C, which grew poorly, all of the strains grew well on solid succinate minimal medium. All of the strains exhibited growth yields in limiting (5 mm) glucose similar to the wild-type control (data not shown). The specific activities of ECF1F0purified from each of the mutants were similar to the wild-type enzyme,i.e. in the range 22–27 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg. Mutant enzyme preparations were treated with CuCl2 to induce formation of disulfide bonds. Experiments were carried out under both ATP conditions (following preincubation with AMP·PNP) and ADP conditions (addition of ATP + Mg2+ followed by enzyme turnover), over a range of CuCl2 concentrations (5–200 μm). A cross-linked product in the range 32–35 kDa was observed with ECF1F0 from mutants Q104C, A128C, G131C, and S146C. No cross linking was obtained with mutant S60C. Data for the mutant bQ104C under ATP conditions are shown in Fig.6 A in the form of a concentration dependence of CuCl2 on cross-linking yield. The maximal yields obtained with this mutant were in the range of 70%. Fig. 6 B shows data for all mutants using the minimum CuCl2 concentration required for maximum cross-link formation under ATP conditions. The appearance of cross-linked product seen in Fig. 6, A andB, was in each case accompanied by a commensurate loss of the b subunit band. That this new band was a b subunit dimer was confirmed by antibody blotting. It reacted with anti-b subunit mAbs but not with antibodies to any of the other subunits of the complex (data not shown). Note the altered migration of both the monomeric and cross-linked dimeric forms of the mutant S146C b subunit. There was no nucleotide dependence of the yield of cross-linking for any of the mutants examined. Subunit b dimer formation had only a small effect on ATPase activity with any of the mutants, e.g. for bQ104C, ATPase activity was 25.1 μmol/min/mg before and 19.2 μmol/min/mg after cross-linking in 70% yield. This is the same loss of ATPase activity obtained by treating wild-type enzyme with CuCl2. There is emerging evidence that the F1 and F0 parts of the ATP synthase are joined not only by the narrow and 40–45-Å long stalk seen in electron micrographs (5Lücken U. Gogol E.P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5339-5343Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and now known to be made up of the γ and ε subunits (3Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Turina P. Wilkens S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 284-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but also by a second stalk provided by the δ and b subunits (9Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). There is clear evidence from cross-linking experiments that the δ subunit is bound at the outside of the α3β3 subunit barrel near the top of the F1 and away from the F0(10Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Lill H. Hensel F. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32737-32742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The δ subunit is a two-domain protein, with an N-terminal domain of around 105 residues, which is roughly globular and contains a six α-helical bundle (9Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and a less ordered C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain must be in close contact with the N-terminal domain in the complex as a cross link is readily formed between intrinsic Cys64 and Cys140 (31Ziegler M. Xiao R. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4233-4239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies have shown that the δ subunit and its equivalent in the mitochondrial enzyme, OSCP, are involved in the interaction of F1 with the F0 part. For example, ECF1 does not bind to F0 in the absence of δ. The key sites for this interaction appear to be in the C terminus of δ. C-terminal truncations of as few as 4–6 residues from either δ or OSCP prevent the rebinding of ECF1 or MF1, respectively, to F0 (32Joshi S. Cao G.-J. Nath C. Shah J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12094-12103Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Jounouchi M. Takeyama M. Chaiprasert P. Noumi T. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The studies presented here show conclusively that the δ subunit binds to b subunits, and that this interaction involves mainly the C-terminal domain of δ. This arrangement had been speculated upon based on cross-linking of δ to subunit CF0I in the chloroplast enzyme (34Beckers G. Berzborn R.J. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the data reported here are the first direct binding experiments. It is shown that δ subunit is required for the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of subunit b with F1. This binding requires the C-terminal domain of δ, as the interaction was lost when δ(1–134) was used in the reconstitution experiments. A complex was obtained between F1 + δ + bsol which was stable to native gel electrophoresis. No such stable complex was formed between δ and bsol in the absence of the F1. It is likely that the α3β3γ domain helps stabilize the interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains of δ, which are required for the tight binding of b subunits. Weak interaction between δ and bsol in solution was observed by NMR and in protease digestion studies. Both the δ and bsol are protected from trypsin digestion in the ECF1 + δ + bsol complex, while the protection of δ and bsol by mixing the two in solution is much less. The binding of bsol blocks rebinding of F1 + δ to F0, consistent with the functional interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of b and δ in the reconstitution experiments. Purified wild-type bsol is a stable dimer, and only a dimer, not monomer, is able to block F1 + δ binding to F0. A priori, the two copies of subunit b could provide separate connections between the F1 and F0parts. However, the results presented here argue against this. First, dimer formation appears to stabilize the secondary structure of bsol. In the monomer form created by introducing an Asp for Gly at position 128, bsol is much less α-helical, because it is highly protease sensitive and denatures at lower temperatures. More direct evidence that b subunits are close in F1F0 was sought by cross-linking studies. Mutants were created with Cys residues at several sites along the C-terminal domain. On the addition of the oxidizing agent Cu2+, disulfide bonds were generated in high yield between Cys at positions 104, 128, 131, and 146, but not at 60. This could happen only if the two b subunits are paired for a significant length. As the δ subunit is near the top of the F1 (10Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Lill H. Hensel F. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32737-32742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the obvious arrangement of the b subunits is an extended one running up one side of the F1F0 structure. In several of the mutants described here, it is possible to react the introduced Cys with bulky maleimides. This should allow us to label the b subunits,e.g. with gold particles, and then visualize them in side views of F1F0 by cryoelectron microscopy.

We have mapped the chromatin structure of the human, estrogen-responsive pS2 promoter at nucleotide level resolution within the context of its normal genomic location in human mammary epithelial cells. In vivo digestion by nucleases followed by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed two rotationally phased and translationally positioned nucleosomes within the promoter between nucleotide positions −450 and +7. The estrogen response elements at −400 and TATAA box at −35 are each located at the edge of a nucleosome. The two precisely positioned nucleosomes exist in both transformed and nontransformed human mammary epithelial cells, regardless of estrogen receptor status or transcriptional activity of the gene. However, two structural alterations correlate with the transcriptional potential of the promoter. In MCF-7 cells, in which the pS2 promoter is inducible, the chromatin exhibits an increased sensitivity to DNase I in a region of DNA adjacent to the TATAA box and an additional micrococcal nuclease-hypersensitive site in the linker DNA between the two positioned nucleosomes. We were also able to demonstrate that nucleotides −1100 to +10 of the pS2 promoter are sufficient to determine the positioning of these two nucleosomes.

Regulation of transcription in mammalian cells is strongly influenced by the presence of nucleosomes within promoters and by the ensuing higher order chromatin structures. The nucleosomal organization of a promoter is defined by the rotational and translational positioning of nucleosomes on DNA. If a nucleosome occupies a fixed position relative to the underlying sequence of DNA, the nucleosome is said to be translationally positioned (1Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 2Chen H. Li B. Workman J.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 380-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Likewise, an invariant orientation of the DNA helix relative to the surface of the histone octamer with respect to a specific sequence of DNA defines it as rotationally positioned. Several distinct steps of the transcription process, as dissected in vitro, can be affected by nucleosomes. One consequence of nucleosomal packaging of DNA can be limited accessibility of the DNA to DNA-binding proteins (for review see Ref. 3Owen-Hughes T. Workman J.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1994; 4: 403-441PubMed Google Scholar).

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1285-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), bind with a lower affinity to sites located on a nucleosome core particle compared with sites on DNA alone. Accessibility can be influenced further by the rotational positioning of the DNA, with some alignments completely precluding factor binding (4Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E.

Since transcription factors vary in their ability to overcome the limited accessibility of translationally and rotationally positioned nucleosomal DNA, the interplay between transcription factors and the nucleosome positioning at target promoters may define the specific role of each factor in the activation of gene expression (9Taylor I.C.A. Workman J.L. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1285-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).In some cases, transcription factors that are able to bind nucleosomal DNA sites can facilitate the binding of additional factors to the promoter (11Lohr D.

As a clear demonstration of this phenomenon, binding of glucocorticoid receptor to a nucleosomal site in the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter results in a rapid structural alteration in the nucleosome and the concomitant binding of NF-1 (5Archer T.K.

Proteins bound to sites separated by approximately 200 bp can be brought into close proximity when a nucleosome core loops out the intervening DNA (28Elgin S.C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19259-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The compaction state of the chromatin must also modulate protein-protein interactions, as the relative positions of proteins bound to adjacent nucleosomes are determined both by the specific placement of binding sites upon each nucleosome and by positions of the nucleosomes in a higher order structure (29Pruss D. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).To decipher the intricate complexities of the involvement of chromatin structure in transcriptional regulation, it is of the utmost importance to understand the in vivo nucleosome arrangement at a given promoter. To that end, we have analyzed the chromatin structure of the human pS2 promoter, an excellent model system for the study of transcriptional activation from a chromatin template by an inducible transcription factor. Transcription of the pS2 promoter (30Masiakowski P. Breathnach R. Bloch F.G.J. Krust A. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7895-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) is activated by estrogen receptor (ER) (31Kumar V. Green S. Staub A. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2231-2236Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), which binds to a 13-base pair imperfectly palindromic sequence located at −405 to −393, approximately 375 bp from the TATAA box (32Berry M. Nunez A.-M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar).A role for chromatin in the transcriptional regulation of the pS2 promoter is suggested by the characteristics of ER-dependent transcription from other nucleosomal templates. First, the binding of ER and resulting estrogen-dependent transcription from artificial promoters in yeast (33Pham T. Elliston J. Nawaz Z. McDonnell D. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3125-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Pham T. Hwung Y.-P. McDonnell D. O'Malley B. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4525-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and from the rat prolactin gene on a bovine papilloma virus episome (36Seyfred M. Gorski J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1226-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) result in a disruption of chromatin structure at these promoters. Second, ER-dependent transcription in yeast is dependent upon a functioning SWI·SNF complex (37Yoshinaga S.K. Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Finally, in the previously mentioned vitellogenin B1 promoter, reconstituted nucleosomes potentiate activation of transcription by ER (24Corthesy B. Leonnard P. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3926-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).We have mapped at a nucleotide level of resolution the locations of two nucleosomes and a linker region in the human pS2 promoter, in a region encompassing the ERE and the TATAA box from nucleotides −440 to +40. This is the first in vivo detailed characterization of chromatin structure of a natural, estrogen-responsive promoter. Additionally, we have identified particular chromatin features that correlate with the transcriptional potential of the pS2 promoter. Thus, our data provide the basis for understanding the role of chromatin in the transcriptional regulation of the pS2 promoter.RESULTSTo understand the role of chromatin in the transcriptional regulation of the estrogen-inducible pS2 promoter, we examined the nucleosome structure of the pS2 promoter in human breast cells derived from both normal and carcinomatous breast tissue. The cells differed both in the levels of ER and in the inducibility of pS2 mRNA. The normal HMEC, 184 EP cells (49Stampfer M.R. Bartley J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2394-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), do not contain detectable levels of ER or of pS2 mRNA, even upon incubation with estradiol (50Zajchowski D.A. Sager R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1613-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The two tumor cell lines that we examined, MDA-MB 231 and MCF-7, were derived from human breast adenocarcinomas. Similarly to HMEC cells, MDA-MB 231 cells do not express detectable levels of either ER protein (51Horwitz K.B. Zava D.T. Jensen E.M. McGuire W.L. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 2434-2437PubMed Google Scholar) or pS2 mRNA (data not shown). In contrast, the mammary epithelial-like MCF-7 cells express high levels of ER (52Walter P. Greene S. Greene G.L. Krust A. Bornert J.-M. Jeltsch J.-M. Staub A. Jensen E. Scrace G. Waterfield M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7889-7893Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In these cells, the pS2 gene is highly inducible by estradiol (30Masiakowski P. Breathnach R. Bloch F.G.J. Krust A. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 7895-7903Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures,” we observe an average of 10-fold induction of pS2 mRNA by 100 nm estradiol, as opposed to ethanol carrier (data not shown). Maximal induction ratios require the exclusion of estrogenic activity from the non-inducing cell culture media. However, even under non-inducing conditions, basal levels of pS2 mRNA are evident in MCF-7 cells as compared with the non-expressing MDA-MB 231 and CMT cells (data not shown).A Ubiquitous and Precisely Positioned Nucleosome Containing the TATA Box of the pS2 Promoter on the Downstream EdgeThe chromatin structure of the endogenous, single copy pS2 promoter was defined by treating human breast cells with nucleases sensitive to nucleosome positioning and resolving the specific cleavage sites at the nucleotide level by LMPCR. A positioned nucleosome at the TATA box in the pS2 promoter is likely to influence transcriptional regulation from this promoter, due to the differential binding affinity of TBP for a nakedversus nucleosomal template (53Workman J.L. Taylor I.C.A. Kingston R.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) plus the additional influence on TBP binding of the orientation of the TATA sequence relative to the surface of the histone octamer (4Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). We first established the rotational phasing of nucleosomes covering the pS2 promoter by digesting genomic DNA with DNase I, which reveals the 10-base pair periodicity of the double helix when DNA is positioned on the surface of a histone octamer through a 10-bp ladder of alternating nuclease-accessible and nuclease-protected sites (54Noll M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1974; 1: 1573-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore, a triple-nested primer set adjacent to the TATA box in the pS2 promoter and reading into the upstream sequences of the promoter was initially designed for LMPCR. This primer set is designated NT-T (+7): (+7) indicates that nucleotide +7 of the pS2 promoter corresponds to the 3′ nucleotide of the end-labeled primer, NT stands for thenucleosome at the TATA box and -T stands for cleavages in the top strand of the promoter DNA. With NT-T (+7), DNase I treatment revealed a 10-bp ladder in the genomic pS2 promoter in all three cell types, between nucleotide positions −28 and −150 (arrows, Fig. 1,lanes 4–11 and 13–16). Bases hypersensitive to or protected from DNase I cleavage in the chromosomal context were established by comparison with cleavage products from genomic, deproteinized DNA digested with DNase I in vitro (Fig.1, lanes 2, 3, 17, and 18).The edge of the 10-bp periodicity of DNase I accessibility was a pair of adjacent cleavage sites at nucleotides −27 and −28, located within the TATA box (Fig. 1, lanes 4–11 versus lanes 2 and3, designated by the bottom arrow adjacent tolane 11). Overall, the ladder of DNase I cleavages spans 123 bp in this region of the pS2 promoter, covering the TATA sequence. This 10-bp repeating pattern from −27 to −150 was revealed in MCF-7, MDA-MB 231, and 184 cells (arrows, Fig. 1). However, the MCF-7 genomic pS2 promoter DNA had a slightly altered accessibility to DNase I within this region compared with the other cells (Fig. 1,lanes 7–10 and 15 and 16 versus lanes 4–6, 11, 13, and 14, labeled CS1). The 10-bp repeat of hypersensitivities to DNase I relative to naked DNA was still obvious (Fig. 1, arrows and dashes within CS1 bracket), yet the contrast between this repeat and the intervening sequences was softened by cleavages within the protected areas of the 10-bp ladder in the MCF-7 cells, which were not accessible in the other cells examined. An especially distinctive, enhanced sensitivity to DNase I cleavage was apparent at nucleotides −41 and −42 (bottom of the bracketedCS1 area). This altered accessibility was highly reproducible among repeated genomic DNA digestions and LMPCR amplifications.The translational positioning of the nucleosome(s) encompassing this rotationally phased nucleosomal DNA was probed with MNase, which preferentially cuts DNA in the linker regions between nucleosomes (55Wassarman P.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When LMPCR analysis is limited to double-stranded MNase cleavages, MNase-hypersensitive sites figure prominently at the edges of nucleosomes (25McPherson C. Shim E.-Y. Friedman D. Zaret K. Cell. 1993; 75: 387-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). MNase digestion of the genomic pS2 promoter in cells revealed several double-stranded cleavages, not observed upon digestion of deproteinized DNA (Fig. 2), bracketing the rotationally phased DNA (−28 to −150). The downstream edge of the nucleosome covering the TATA box (nucleosome T) was demonstrated by a pronounced set of bands located at nucleotides −22, −23, and −24, within the 3′ edge of the TATA box (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–11 and15–19, as compared with lanes 1 and12–14; lower starred bracket). This 3′ boundary is located 4 bp downstream from the beginning of the DNase I ladder (Fig.2 C, position of star (lane 9) compared with arrows (lanes 4–7)). Hypersensitive sites around −165 defined the 5′ boundary of nucleosome T (upper starred bracket, Fig. 2 A; expanded in Fig.2 B), which is located the length of a nucleosome, 142 bp, upstream of the 3′ boundary. The DNA outside the 5′ edge of nucleosome T, linker TE, was defined by a series of novel and hypersensitive MNase double-stranded cleavages in the region of the promoter between nucleotide positions −165 and −241 (bracket, Fig.2 A, lanes 2–11; expanded in Fig. 2 B). Comparison of the MNase digestion patterns in the different cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB 231, and 184) demonstrated that nucleosome T is translationally positioned in all cases (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–11). Of note, estrogen-induced, maximal transcriptional activation of the promoter (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3, 5, and 19) did not displace nucleosome T, even though the TATA box is contained within the extreme 3′ edge of the nucleosome. The presence of nucleosome T was confirmed at both 1 h after estradiol addition (Fig. 2, lane 19) and between 14 and 23 h after induction (Fig. 2, lanes 3, 5, 15, and 16). Transcriptional activity of pS2 is maximized at 1 h after estrogen treatment and is maintained at this level for at least 24 h, as determined by a nuclear run-on assay (56Brown A.M.C. Jeltsch J.-M. Roberts M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6344-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).Figure 2Translational positioning of nucleosome T places the TATAA box at the nucleosomal edge. Double-stranded MNase cleavages of pS2 genomic promoter DNA from MDA-MB 231, MCF-7, and 184 human breast cells and of control protein-free DNA are shown at a nucleotide level of resolution, following amplification with NT-T (+7). The positions of nucleosome T (NUC T), linker TE, and linker T (L-T) are portrayed in the diagrams next to the gels. The brackets marked by stars indicate the nucleosome-induced hypersensitive areas at the edges of nucleosome T. The unstarred bracket highlights MNase cleavages of chromosomal DNA in the linker regions. The cells and DNA were treated as described in the legend to Fig. 1 but digested with MNase. Increasing amounts of total MNase digestion are indicated by thetriangles above the lanes. A, MNase cleavages of the pS2 promoter from linker T (L-T) to linker TE (L-TE), positions −5 to −250, are shown. The indicated cell lines were treated with either ethanol vehicle (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 15, and 16), estradiol (E 2) (lanes 3, 5, 7, 9, and19), or ICI 164,384 (ICI) (lane 18) prior to digestion. Cleavages of naked DNA controls are shown inlanes 1, 12–14, and 17. B, MNase cleavages of the pS2 promoter, highlighting details at the boundary of nucleosome T and linker TE.

C, comparison of positions of DNase I cleavages of the genomic pS2 promoter DNA (lanes 2–7) to those of MNase cleavages (lanes 8 and9) in the vicinity of the boundary between nucleosome T (NUC T) and linker T (L-T).

To investigate the nucleosomal positioning of the genomic DNA surrounding the ERE at −400, two triple-nested primer sets were designed to probe both the top (NE-T (−264)) and bottom (NE-B (−419)) strands of this region (NE stands for nucleosome encompassing the ERE). First, chromosomal DNA was digested with DNase I to determine the rotational phasing of nucleosomal DNA in the region. The location of the NE-B (−419) primer set was technically restrained by the repetitive Alu sequence DNA 85 bp upstream of the ERE (52Walter P. Greene S. Greene G.L. Krust A. Bornert J.-M. Jeltsch J.-M. Staub A. Jensen E. Scrace G. Waterfield M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7889-7893Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), restricting the extent of upstream DNA that could be examined. Nonetheless, a 10-bp ladder of DNase I cleavages was visualized from −398, within the ERE, to −278 (arrows, Fig. 3 A, lanes 4–14). From the top strand, where the upstream end of the 10-bp ladder could be more distinctly resolved, rotational phasing clearly extended upstream to nucleotide −411, beyond the ERE (note in particular the upper arrow, comparing lanes 11–14 to lane 15 in Fig. 3 B). Thus, rotational phasing of nucleosomal DNA was detected between positions −278 and −410, in all three types of breast cells (Fig. 3,A and B) and independent of activation of transcription by addition of estradiol in the MCF-7 cells (Fig.3 A, lanes 7, 9, and 12; Fig. 3 B, lanes 3, 5, and 13). Due to the inclusion of the ERE in this rotationally phased nucleosomal DNA, the nucleosome(s) involved was named nucleosome E.Figure 3The ERE is contained within rotationally phased nucleosomal DNA. DNase I cleavages of pS2 genomic promoter DNA from various human breast cells were analyzed at a nucleotide level of resolution following amplification with primers bracketing the ERE. Treatment of the indicated cells with ethanol vehicle, estradiol (E 2), or ICI 164,384 (ICI) is as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Arrows indicate the positions of the nucleosome-induced cleavage sites comprising the 10-bp ladder. The bracketed ERE indicates the position of the estrogen response element from position −393 to −405. The positions of nucleosome E (NUC E), linker TE (L-TE), and linker E (L-E) are diagrammed at the sides of the gels.A, rotational phasing of the DNA in nucleosome E, as detected by DNase I analysis of the bottom strand of the pS2 promoter from nucleotide −410 to −225, with NE-B (−419). LMPCR of DNase I cleavages in the control DNA is shown in lanes 1–3 and15–17, and cleavages in cellular DNA are shown inlanes 4–14. Increasing amounts of total DNase I digestion are indicated by triangles above the lanes. B,rotational phasing of the DNA in nucleosome E, as detected by DNase I analysis of the top strand of the pS2 promoter from nucleotide position −270 to −460 with NE-T (−264). Analysis of cleavages of control, deproteinated MCF-7 DNA is shown in lanes 1 and15. Analysis of DNA digested in cells is shown inlanes 2–9 and 11–14. The G sequence ladder is shown in lane 10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the translational positioning of nucleosome E, double-stranded MNase cleavage sites were mapped, initially with primer set NE-B (−419) (Fig. 4). A downstream nucleosomal border was established by an intense, novel cleavage site at −270 in the chromosomal DNA in all the breast cells (lower star, Fig. 4 A, lanes 4–13), 8 bp closer to the initiation site than the edge of the 10-bp ladder of nucleosome E (Fig.3 A). (Note that the nearby site digested by MNase in naked DNA, at −265, is not accessible to double-stranded MNase cleavage in the nucleosomal DNA.) A double-stranded MNase cleavage site at −420, 150 bp from the pronounced cleavage at −270 (Fig. 4 A), defined the upstream edge of nucleosome E, as analyzed by LMPCR using NE-T (−264) (Fig. 5, lowest band within starred bracket, lanes 3–6). Thus, the length of DNA separating these borders is in agreement with the expected size of a nucleosome.Figure 4The downstream edge of the nucleosome encompassing the ERE abuts a cell type-specific, double-stranded MNase cleavage site. MNase double-stranded cleavages of the genomic pS2 promoter DNA from −412 to −190 were analyzed following amplification with NE-B (−419). A, DNA was digested with MNase in the indicated cells after treatment with either ethanol vehicle (lanes 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, and 13) or estradiol (E 2) (lanes 5, 7, 10, and11). Deproteinized DNA was similarly digested and analyzed (lanes 1–3). Increasing amounts"

However, the cellular receptor(s) responsible for the catabolism and potential mediation of chemotaxis by C1-INH-protease complexes remained obscure. To determine whether the SEC receptor mediates the binding and potential chemotaxis of C1-INH·C1̄s, we performed binding assays with HepG2 cells, neutrophils, and monocytes, and the results show that C1-INH·C1̄s neither bind to these cells nor cause a chemotactic response of neutrophils and monocytes. Furthermore, C1-INH·C1̄s, the COOH-terminal C1 inhibitor peptide, or the tetrameric C1-INH·C1̄s·C1̄r·C1-INH complex were found to be significantly less effective in competing with the SEC receptor ligand 125I-peptide 105Y for the binding to HepG2 cells than unlabeled 105Y, indicating that the SEC receptor does not sufficiently recognize C1-INH-protease complexes. The asialoglycoprotein receptor was also ruled out to be responsible for the removal of the heavily glycosylated C1-INH·C1̄s complex, since asialoorosomucoid did not compete for the clearance of C1-INH·125I-C1̄s and asialoglycoprotein receptor knockout mice showed no alterations in the C1-INH·125I-C1̄s clearance rate. We found that C1-INH·125I-C1̄s complexes were efficiently degraded by normal murine fibroblasts expressing the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) and cellular degradation was significantly reduced by chloroquine and the receptor-associated protein, which is a potent inhibitor of the binding of all known ligands to LRP. Moreover, receptor-associated protein inhibited thein vivo clearance of C1-INH·125I-C1̄s and murine fibroblasts genetically deficient for LRP did not degrade C1-INH·125I-C1̄s. Our results demonstrate that C1-INH·C1̄s complexes do not stimulate neutrophil or monocytic chemotaxis but are removed by LRP, further underscoring its role as a serpin-enzyme complex clearance receptor.

Thielens N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is also one of the major inhibitors of plasma kallikrein and factor XIIa. Thus, C1-INH plays an essential role as a regulator of the activation of the classical complement pathway and the contact system, and genetic or acquired deficiencies of C1-INH result in recurrent episodes of angioedema (2Davis 3d, A.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 595-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). C1-INH is a member of the superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) and one of the most heavily glycosylated plasma proteins (3Bock S.C. Skriver K. Nielsen E. Thogersen H.C. Wiman B. Donaldson V.H. Eddy R.L. Marrinan J. Radziejewska E. Huber R. Shows T.B. Magnusson S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4292-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Like other serpins, C1-INH inhibits target proteases by forming a stable covalent serpin-enzyme complex (SEC), resulting in the cleavage of the P1-P1′ peptide bond of the reactive center loop of the inhibitor and in the generation of a COOH-terminal peptide of M r 4152 (4Nilsson T. Sjoholm I. Wiman B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 5Salvesen G.S. Catanese J.J. Kress L.F. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2432-2436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of a SEC is accompanied with a large structural rearrangement of the serpin, and it has been concluded that this reveals a receptor recognition site (6Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, a crucial function of serpins is to provide a tag for the removal of proteolytic enzymes from the circulation by cellular receptors, thereby preventing excessive and harmful proteolysis of blood and tissue proteins (7Schulze A.J. Huber R. Bode W. Engh R.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In general, SECs are cleared much more rapidly than are the proteolytically inactivated or native serpins (6Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although the data of Mast et al. (6Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) have indicated that the target protease does not play a role for the clearance of SECs, recent findings of de Smet et al. (8de Smet B.J. de Boer J.P. Agterberg J. Rigter G. Bleeker W.K. Hack C.E. Blood. 1993; 81: 56-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of Malek et al. (9Malek R. Aulak K.S. Davis III, A.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 105: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have shown that the clearance rates of different C1-INH-protease complexes significantly differ. They have found that the turnover was most rapid for C1-INH·C1̄s, followed by C1-INH-kallikrein and C1-INH-XIIa, suggesting a direct role of the protease in determining the clearance receptor affinity. However, the receptor(s) involved in the catabolism of C1-INH-protease complexes has not been identified. Different types of receptors have been proposed for the binding and uptake of SECs. HepG2 cells, monocytes, and neutrophils have been reported to express a not yet completely characterized SEC receptor, which binds, internalizes, and degrades several serpin-protease complexes, including those with α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT), α1-antichymotrypsin (α1-ACT), antithrombin III (ATIII), and, to a much lesser extent, C1-INH·C1̄s (10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the SEC receptor has been shown to mediate the increase in synthesis of α1-AT and elicits neutrophil chemotaxis after binding of α1-AT-elastase (11Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the SEC receptor recognizes a specific pentapeptide sequence highly conserved among serpins, which is located carboxyl-terminal to the reactive center loop of the serpins (residues 370–374 of α1-AT) and is exposed after complex formation. This is based on studies using analogous peptides (e.g. peptide 105Y corresponding to residues 359–374 of α1-AT), which block the binding of SECs to HepG2 cells in a sequence-specific manner and by the finding that such peptides bind specifically and saturably to neutrophils, monocytes, and HepG2 cells, thereby stimulating the biosynthesis of α1-AT and the chemotaxis of neutrophils (PMN) (11Joslin G.

A second SEC receptor has been proposed, termed SEC II receptor, which mediates the clearance of α2-antiplasmin (α2-AP)-protease complexes. This has been concluded by the finding that α2-AP-protease complexes do not compete for the catabolic turnover of α1-AT-, α1-ACT-, and ATIII-proteinase complexes by the SEC receptor (6Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated the role of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) in the constitutive clearance of SECs (14Orth K. Madison E.L. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F.

LRP mediates the cellular uptake of several unrelated ligands, including lipoproteins, lipoprotein lipase, proteinase- or methylamine-activated α2-macroglobulin (α2-M*), proteases, SECs, bacterial toxins, and lactoferrin (reviewed in Ref. 17Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar). Some of these ligands can compete with each other for the binding to LRP, whereas others bind to independent sites on the receptor (18Willnow T.E. Orth K. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15827-15832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of LRP is essential for embryogenesis, because embryos with a targeted disruption of the LRP gene die early in utero (19Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The functional activity of LRP is controlled in vivo by a receptor-associated protein (RAP) of 39 kDa, which has recently been shown to act as a chaperone in the biosynthesis and maturation of the receptor (20Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). RAP blocks the binding of all known ligands to LRP and copurifies with the receptor (21Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have investigated the potential chemotactic activity and clearance of C1-INH·C1̄s, and our results demonstrate that C1-INH·C1̄s (i) does not stimulate neutrophil or monocytic chemotaxis, but (ii) is removed from the circulation by LRP. Human (hu) C1-INH and hu C1̄s was prepared as described previously (1Arlaud G.J. Thielens N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 61-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 24Alsenz J. Loos M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 96: 107Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Human α1-AT, hu α2-macroglobulin, hu orosomucoid, bovine trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated), bovine elastase, and neuraminidase type XA attached to agarose beads were purchased from Sigma. Human RAP, expressed in DH5α bacteria as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, was prepared as described (21Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide 105Y (SIPPEVKFNKPFVYLI) corresponding to residues 359–374 of α1-AT (10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was purchased from Chiron Mimotopes, Victoria, Australia. Methylamine-activated α2-macroglobulin (α2-M*) was prepared as described (22Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Asialoglycoprotein receptor knockout mice (25Ishibashi S. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27803-27806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Different rabbit polyclonal antibodies against hu C1-INH were obtained from Behring (Marburg, Germany). Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 13E1 α-hu C1-INH, mAb 303D4 α-hu C1̄s, and mAb 98F12 α-hu C1̄r have been described elsewhere (26Storm D. Loos M. Kaul M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 199: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against a peptide derived from the carboxyl-terminal end of trypsinized C1-INH was raised in a New Zealand White rabbit. The antibody was purified on protein G (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and specific antibody titers were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). C1-INH·C1̄s complexes were formed as described previously (27Patston P.A. Medcalf R.L. Kourteva Y. Schapira M. Blood. 1993; 82: 3371-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complex formation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and ELISA as described (26Storm D. Loos M. Kaul M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 199: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Pure C1-INH·C1̄s complexes were isolated by anion exchange chromatography on a Hydrobore AX column (Rainin, MA) fitted to an HPLC system (Gilson-Abimed, Langenfeld, Germany) applying a linear gradient of buffer A (10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0) and buffer B (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7.0). Tetrameric C1-INH·C1̄s·C1̄r·C1-INH complexes were prepared using a procedure described by Ziccardi and Cooper (28Ziccardi R.J. Cooper N.R. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 788-792PubMed Google Scholar). Complexes of α1-AT-trypsin or α1-AT-elastase were prepared and purified as described (29Fuchs H.E. Michalopoulos G.K. Pizzo S.V. J. Cell Biochem. 1984; 25: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Serpin-enzyme complexes were quantitated with the Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The amount of complexes in preparations containing residual unreacted serpin was determined by densitometry scanning of SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Herolab Densitometer, Herolab, Wiesloch, Germany). C1̄s, α2-M*, and asialoorosomucoid (ASOR) were labeled with [125I]iodine (ICN) to specific activities ranging from 2 to 6 × 106 cpm/μg of protein using IODO-BEADS (Pierce). C1-INH·125I-C1̄s complexes and asialo-C1-INH·125I-C1̄s complexes were prepared by incubating the enzyme with the inhibitor at a molar ratio of 1:1.5 (enzyme:inhibitor) for 0.5–1 h at 37 °C. Complex formation was assessed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, and C1-INH·125I-C1̄s- and asialo-C1-INH·125I-C1̄s complexes were quantitated using the Molecular Imager GS-250 (Bio-Rad). Peptide 105Y was labeled with [125I]iodine (ICN) as described previously (10Perlmutter D.H. Glover G.I. Rivetna M. Schasteen C.S. Fallon R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3753-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivity of various preparations was 4–6 × 106 cpm/μg of peptide. The cleavage of C1-INH by trypsin and the purification of the released COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide were performed essentially as detailed previously (30Aulak K.S. Pemberton P.A. Rosen F.S. Carrell R.W. Lachmann P.J. Harrison R.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The peptide was subjected to NH2-terminal sequence analysis on a 473A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and quantitated by amino acid hydrolysis (420A derivatizer analyzer system; Applied Biosystems). The COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide was stored at −20 °C. Western blotting of C1̄s, C1-INH, pure C1-INH·C1̄s complexes, and the COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide after separation on 10% Tricine-SDS-PAGE (31Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar) was performed according to established procedures (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44938) Google Scholar). Immunostaining was performed with a polyclonal antibody against the COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated polyclonal goat IgG antibodies against rabbit IgG (Sigma), followed by a color reaction using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride. Desialylation of C1-INH was performed as described (33Minta J.O. J. Immunol. 1981; 126: 245-249PubMed Google Scholar), and the preparation of ASOR has been described elsewhere (25Ishibashi S. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27803-27806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of sialic acid from C1-INH and orosomucoid was verified with sialic acid-specific lectin Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) using the DIG glycan differentiation kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A normal mouse fibroblast line (MEF-1, ATCC CRL-2214) and a mouse fibroblast cell line with a homozygous LRP deficiency (PEA-13, ATCC CRL-2216) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and maintained as described (34Willnow T.E. Herz J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43A: 305-334Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells (ATCC HB-8065) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. HepG2 cells used for flow cytometric analysis were removed from flasks using PBS with 1 mm EDTA. Cells were then washed in 0.1% BSA-PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated and cultured as detailed previously (29Fuchs H.E. Michalopoulos G.K. Pizzo S.V. J. Cell Biochem. 1984; 25: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). PMN and monocytes used for flow cytometric and radioreceptor binding experiments were prepared, cultured, and harvested as described previously (26Storm D. Loos M. Kaul M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 199: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Chemotactic activity was determined in modified Boyden chambers by the micropore-filter leading front assay essentially as described by Brenneis et al. (35Brenneis H. Schmidt A. Blaas Mautner P. Worner I. Ludwig R. Hansch G.M. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 23: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and in a 48-well chemotaxis microchamber (Neuroprobe, Rockville, MD) according to the methodology of Brandes et al. (36Brandes M.E. Mai U.E. Ohura K. Wahl S.M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1600-1606PubMed Google Scholar). Chemotaxis was evaluated using different dilutions of C1-INH, purified C1-INH·C1̄s complexes, and the COOH-terminal derived C1-INH peptide. Medium alone served as a negative control, and FMLP (10−8m; Sigma) or zymosan-activated serum provided a positive control. In competitive experiments, PMN were incubated with either 10 nm α1-AT-elastase complexes or 10 nm purified C1-INH·C1̄s complexes for 15 min at 37 °C, and then washed three times with medium. The cells were then assayed for a chemotactic response to 1 nmα1-AT-elastase complexes. Controls were performed simultaneously with medium alone or with 10 nm FMLP. Binding experiments with C1-INH·125I-C1̄s complexes were performed at 4 °C as described previously (27Patston P.A. Medcalf R.L. Kourteva Y. Schapira M. Blood. 1993; 82: 3371-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-competition binding studies using peptide 125I-105Y and unlabeled peptide 105Y, C1-INH·C1̄s complexes, C1-INH·C1̄s·C1̄r·C1-INH complexes, and the COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide as competitors were carried out essentially as described by Joslin et al. (11Joslin G. Wittwer A. Adams S. Tollefsen D.M. August A. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1886-1893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For binding studies with monocytes and PMN, triplicate samples of 1 × 105 cells/tube in HBSS, 0.1% BSA were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with varying amounts of radiolabeled C1-INH·C1̄s complexes (5–50 nm) in a final volume of 150 μl. Unbound ligand was removed by layering 100 μl of the samples on 300 μl of 30% (w/v) sucrose in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for subsequent centrifugation. After spinning for 1.5 min, the tips of the tubes containing the cell pellets were cut off for counting radioactivity in a γ counter (Canberra-Packard). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled complexes (reaction mixture). Uptake assays with primary rat hepatocytes and C1-INH·125I-C1̄s were performed as described previously (29Fuchs H.E. Michalopoulos G.K. Pizzo S.V. J. Cell Biochem. 1984; 25: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The incubation of PMN, monocytes, and HepG2 cells with purified C1-INH·C1̄s and the flow cytometric analysis was conducted as described (26Storm D. Loos M. Kaul M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 199: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The potential effect of cell activation on binding of C1-INH·C1̄s complexes to PMN or monocytes was determined by preincubation of the cells (2 × 106/ml) with 100 nm FMLP for up to 30 min at 37 °C or with 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and chilled to 4 °C, after which flow cytometric analysis was performed. Control cells were brought to 37 °C for the same time in the absence of stimulus. Cell activation was controlled employing mAb α-CD35 (Dakopatts). In competition assays using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated α1-AT-trypsin complexes (FITC-α1-AT-trypsin), PMN were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 1 μm FITC-α1-AT-trypsin alone or in the presence of increasing molar excesses (0.5–10-fold) of unlabeled α1-AT-trypsin or C1-INH·C1̄s complexes (reaction mixture). Cells were washed, and the cell-associated fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry. HepG2, MEF-1 and PEA-13 cells were seeded into 12-well plates and grown for 24 h in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, and 2 mm glutamine prior to the addition of125I-labeled ligands. The medium was then replaced by DMEM (without glutamine) containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA and the indicated iodinated ligands. Cellular degradation of 125I-labeled proteins was measured as described previously (37Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar) and is expressed as nanograms of 125I-labeled trichloroacetic acid-soluble (non-iodide) material released into the culture medium per indicated number of cells. 0.1–1 μg of C1-INH·125I-C1̄s or asialo-C1-INH·125I-C1̄s in sterile PBS (total volume 100 μl) were injected within 10 s in the lateral tail vein of 12–16-week-old BALB/c mice (weighing 20–25 g) and in 15-week-old female ASGPR knockout mice in the absence or presence of competitors. At the indicated time points, blood samples were collected by retro-orbital bleeding of the anesthetized mice, and the amount of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in 20 μl of plasma was determined as described (34Willnow T.E. Herz J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43A: 305-334Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For tissue distribution studies, the abdomen of anesthetized mice were cut open and a cannula was inserted into the portal vein. Livers were perfused with 5 ml of PBS, 0.1% BSA to remove the blood-associated radioactivity. Subsequently, the major organs were removed, weighed, and assessed for radioactivity. We have shown in a previous study that the 34-amino acid COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide remains tightly bound to the reactive center-cleaved C1-INH, which was affinity-purified from the plasma of patients suffering from acquired angioedema (type II) (38Alsenz J. Lambris J.D. Bork K. Loos M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1794-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To test whether this COOH-terminal fragment remains also associated with the C1-INH·C1̄s complex, the complex was purified under physiological conditions using aqueous buffers at neutral pH to remove any uncomplexed components. The purified complex was then analyzed by nonreducing Tricine-SDS-PAGE and by Western blots. Silver staining of the gels and detection of the blots using a polyclonal antibody against the COOH-terminal peptide revealed that the 4.1-kDa COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide remained non-covalently associated with the C1-INH·C1̄s complex (Fig.1). Chemotaxis assays were performed to determine whether the inhibitory complex of C1-INH and C1̄s or the COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide is chemotactic for PMN and monocytes, as has previously been postulated (39Potempa J. Fedak D. Dubin A. Mast A. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21482-21487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide was isolated from trypsinized C1-INH by reversed-phase HPLC, where two major peaks could be detected (Fig.2 B). The peptide contained in peak 2 (Fig. 2 B) was subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing, which confirmed that it was derived from the cleavage between the P1 arginine and P1′ threonine residues of the reactive center loop. The concentration of the 4.1-kDa C1-INH peptide was determined by amino acid hydrolysis. Dilutions of the 4.1-kDa C1-INH peptide, the purified C1-INH·C1̄s complex, as well as native C1-INH were assayed for their ability to stimulate migration of PMN in modified Boyden chambers or in a 48-well chemotaxis microchamber. As shown in Fig. 3 A, there was no significant chemotactic migration of PMN toward the probes in modified Boyden chambers when compared with control medium (HBSS, 0.5% BSA). There was also no chemotactic activity detectable when the samples were assayed in 48-well chemotaxis microchambers using either PMN (data not shown) or monocytes (Fig. 3 B). This was not due to a general impairment of the chemotactic activity of the cells, since diluted zymosan-activated serum (in modified Boyden chamber assays) or 10−8m FMLP (in 48-well microchambers) caused a significant chemotactic response of the cells (Fig. 3, Aand B). Furthermore, preincubation of PMN with purified C1-INH·C1̄s failed to suppress the chemotactic activity toward α1-AT-elastase (Fig. 3 C), which has been shown previously to be a potent chemoattractant (40Banda M.J. Rice A.G. Griffin G.L. Senior R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4481-4484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, preincubation of the cells with α1-AT-elastase markedly reduced the number of migrated PMN toward 1 nmα1-AT-elastase in the lower wells of the chamber (Fig.3 C). These results indicate that the COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide or the C1-INH·C1̄s complex do not cause chemotaxis of PMN and monocytes and thus are not pro-inflammatory.Figure 3Chemotaxis assays with C1-INH, purified C1-INH·C1̄s, and the COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide.Chemotaxis of different dilutions of C1-INH, purified C1-INH·C1̄s, and the COOH-terminal C1-INH peptide was assayed with PMN in modified Boyden chambers (A) or with monocytes in a 48-well chemotaxis microchamber (B) as des"

Biochem. 217, 220–230) modified to include urea in the polyacrylamide gels. Combining this method with Western blot analysis, disulfide cross-linking, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the second dimension showed that NFL readily forms significant amounts of heterodimer with NFH, NFM, α-internexin, or peripherin in the presence of 2 murea. α-Internexin and peripherin also formed heterodimers with NFH or NFM under these conditions. The modified version of blue native gel electrophoresis described here may be useful in monitoring the impact of post-translational modifications and mutations on the dimerization of intermediate filament proteins.

Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar for a review). IF proteins belong to a large family of related polypeptides that share a characteristic tripartite domain organization consisting of a conserved ∼310-amino acid-long α-helical “rod” domain flanked by amino-terminal “head” and carboxyl-terminal “tail” domains of more heterogeneous length and composition (see Ref. 2Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar for a review). The first step in IF assembly involves dimerization of two identical subunits, as seen with vimentin and desmin (3Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), or two different subunits, as in the case of keratins (4Hatzfeld M. Weber K. J.

This initial dimerization step produces an unstaggered parallel coiled-coil species (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar) that can be chemically cross-linked with the copper phenanthroline (CuP2) reagent in cases where the subunits contain a cysteine residue located in the rod domain (3Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Neuronal cells from cultured embryonic rat dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are unusual in that they contain at least five different developmentally regulated and co-assembled neuronal IF (nIF) subunits (6Athlan E.S. Sacher M.S. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). They include α-internexin (7Chiu F.C. Barnes E.A. Das K. Haley J. Socolow P. Macaluso F.P. Fant J. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1435-1445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), peripherin (8Portier M.-M. de Néchaud B. Gros F. Dev. Neurosci. 1984; 6: 335-344Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and the neurofilament (NF) triplet proteins, which consist of the heavy (NFH), mid-sized (NFM), and low (NFL) molecular mass subunits (9Hoffman P.N. Lasek R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Among these five nIF proteins, only NFL has been purified and chemically cross-linked as a dimer (3Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), although disulfide-linked peripherin dimers that occur naturally in vivo have been reported (10Chadan S. Moya K.L. Portier M.-M. Filliatreau G. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1894-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). NFs appear to be obligate heteropolymers in vivo (11Lee M.K. Xu Z. Wong P.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 12Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and individual NF subunits can also be incorporated into an α-internexin (12Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), peripherin (13Parysek L.M. McReynolds M.A. Goldman R.D. Ley C.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 30: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), or vimentin (14Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 50: 475-490Google Scholar, 15Sun D. Macioce P. Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) network. Several lines of evidence support or suggest the existence of NFH/NFL or NFM/NFL heterodimers as the smallest heteromeric unit of NF assembly. For instance, cross-linking analysis of native or partially disassembled NFs revealed that NFM could be cross-linked to NFL through cysteine residues located in the rod domain, although the approach that was used could not differentiate intra- from inter-coiled-coil dimer cross-linking (16Carden M.J. Eagles P.A.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Mulligan et al. (17Mulligan L. Balin B.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Ip W. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) concluded that the existence of NFH/NFL and NFM/NFL heterodimers could best reconcile their immunoelectron microscopic data with the available literature (see discussion in Ref. 17Mulligan L. Balin B.J. Lee V.M.-Y. Ip W. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 106: 145-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Finally, NFH and NFM were found to interact more strongly with NFL than with themselves or with each other in a yeast two-hybrid system paradigm, suggesting that heterodimer formation with NFL is favored over NFH and/or NFM oligomerization (18Carpenter D.A. Ip W. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2493-2498PubMed Google Scholar, 19Leung C.L. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14041-14044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To date, however, the smallest NF hetero-oligomers examined biochemically were reported to be heterotetramers containing equimolar amounts of NFH or NFM with NFL. However, it could not be determined whether these were assembled from individual homo- or heterodimers (20Cohlberg J.A. Hajarian H. Tran T. Alipourjeddi P. Noveen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9334-9339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Moreover, Triton-soluble hetero-oligomers of α-internexin, peripherin, and the NF subunits have been reported, but their precise composition also remains unknown (6Athlan E.S. Sacher M.S. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the precise nature of the smallest hetero-oligomers involving the various nIF proteins is still elusive, due largely to the limitations of experimental approaches capable of resolving and characterizing these small in vivoor in vitro assembly intermediates. A novel “blue” native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) system has recently been described in which Coomassie Blue G-250 is used to confer a negative charge to protein complexes, allowing them to be separated on the basis of their molecular mass while preserving their native associations (21Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Initial studies conducted in our laboratory showed that BN-PAGE, rendered “semi-native” by inclusion of 2 m urea, resolved nIF proteins into what appeared to be heterocomplexes. Further studies of nIF protein complexes were initiated in which various combinations of individually purified denatured subunits were assembled by dialysis against buffered 2m urea. Subsequent analysis of assembled protein complexes by 2 m urea-BN-PAGE, together with other techniques, demonstrated that NFL forms heterodimers with NFH or NFM and that α-internexin and peripherin can form heterodimers with the individual NF subunits. These results indicate that previously reported interactions between the various nIF proteins (6Athlan E.S. Sacher M.S. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) may take place at the level of heterodimer formation. 13,000 ×g insoluble cytoskeletal extracts of embryonic cultured DRG neurons and PC12 cells were prepared essentially as described (6Athlan E.S. Sacher M.S. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NFH, NFM, NFL, and α-internexin were isolated as NFs from rat spinal cord as described (22Julien J.-P. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10467-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas peripherin was from Triton X-100-insoluble PC12 cell extracts. These preparations were solubilized and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and separated by discontinuous SDS-PAGE in the presence of 15 mm thioglycolic acid to prevent oxidation of the cysteine residues. The proteins of interest were visualized, excised, and electroeluted as described previously (22Julien J.-P. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10467-10470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The electroeluted material was recovered, and solid urea was added to a concentration of 2 m. These SDS-containing solutions were then applied to individual columns of Extractigel detergent-removing matrix (Pierce) equilibrated with a degassed buffer containing 2m urea, 50 mm Tris (pH 9.0), and 5 mm DTT. Following elution with the same buffer, an aliquot was removed for quantification and verification of protein purity and for SDS assay to ensure that the detergent had been removed (24Sokoloff R.L. Frigon R.P. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 138-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The protein solutions were dialyzed against a buffer containing 6m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm BisTris (pH 7.0), and 5 mm DTT by repeated centrifugations in a Centricon dialysis spin column (Amicon, Montreal, Canada), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until further use. Proteins quantified by the bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma) were purified in the absence of reducing agents, and the SDS removal protocol was replaced with dialysis against 5 mm NaCl and 0.01% SDS in the Centricon spin columns. This permitted the removal of Tris, glycine, DTT, and excess SDS, which may interfere with the protein assay. Embryonic rat DRGs were dissected, dispersed, and maintained in defined medium as described previously (6Athlan E.S. Sacher M.S. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Giasson B.I. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30404-30409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The individually purified nIF proteins were mixed (final concentration of 0.1–1.0 mm) and dialyzed in a Microdialyzer apparatus (Pierce) at room temperature for 2.5 h against two to three changes of an extensively degassed buffer containing 50 mm BisTris (pH 7.0) and urea at the concentrations specified in the figure legends. Dialyzed samples of nIF protein complexes were cross-linked through their cysteine residues by adding CuP2 (3Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Carden M.J. Eagles P.A.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 26Kobashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 158: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) from a freshly prepared concentrated stock solution to a final concentration of 15 mm. Cross-linking was carried out for 20 min at room temperature and stopped by adding EDTA to 5 mm and iodoacetamide to 50 mm (modified from Refs. 3Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Carden M.J. Eagles P.A.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, and26Kobashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 158: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). nIF protein complexes were resolved by BN-PAGE as described (21Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Stacking gels were omitted, and aminocaproic acid in the gels was replaced with 2 m urea. 5% glycerol was added to gel solutions used to pour gradient gels. The upper tank buffer contained 0.01% Coomassie Blue G-250; the 9-fold concentrated loading buffer contained 50 mm BisTris (pH 7.0), 2 murea, 2.5% Coomassie Blue G-250, and 50% glycerol. Gels were cast in a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus and electrophoresed at 100 V. Dissociation of assembled protein complexes was achieved by heating the samples to 56 °C for 4 min immediately prior to electrophoresis, which effectively prevented reassembly. Dissociation of disulfide-linked protein complexes was achieved by including 10 mm DTT in the heated samples. For second dimension gel electrophoresis, lanes were cut out of the gels after BN-PAGE and incubated in 1.5-fold concentrated SDS sample buffer with or without 5% β-mercaptoethanol as described in the figure legends. Discontinuous gel electrophoresis of the samples on 4.5 or 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels was performed as described (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis on 4% Weber and Osborn-type gels (27Weber K. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was performed essentially as described (28.Sigma (1988) Sigma Technical Bulletin MWS-877 X, St. Louis, MO.Google Scholar), except that regular Tris-containing SDS sample buffer (see above) was used for dilution of samples. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Montreal) as described (6Athlan E.S. Sacher M.S. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). After electroblotting of proteins resolved by BN-PAGE, PVDF membranes were rinsed in methanol to remove Coomassie Blue. Proteins were detected with specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against NFL (NR4), NFM (NN18), and NFH (N52) (Sigma) and against peripherin (mAb1527) and α-internexin (mAb1525) (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA). Probing with mAbs, erasure of the blot for subsequent reprobing, and visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence were conducted according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (NEN, Mississauga, Canada). Polyacrylamide gels were fixed for 10–20 min in destaining solution (10% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid), stained overnight in Coomassie Blue solution (0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250, 25% isopropyl alcohol, and 10% acetic acid) (29Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6177) Google Scholar), and extensively destained against several changes of destaining solution over a 24-h period. Stained gels containing standardized amounts of rat NF proteins resolved alongside unknown samples were scanned and quantified with a BioImager apparatus (Millipore, Montreal). Subunit ratios were calculated using the following molecular masses for the rat NF subunits: NFL, 62 kDa (14Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 50: 475-490Google Scholar); NFM, 95 kDa (30Napolitano E.W. Chin S.S.M. Colman D.R. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2590-2599PubMed Google Scholar); and NFH, 115 kDa (31Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that α-internexin, peripherin, and the NF triplet proteins in cultured DRG neurons were associated (6Athlan E.S. Sacher M.S. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but the methods used could not accurately determine the precise oligomeric arrangement of these proteins. Further studies in our laboratory showed that nIF extracts resolved by BN-PAGE in the presence of increasing amounts of urea contained heterocomplexes of nIF proteins. In Fig. 1, a DRG cytoskeletal pellet extracted with 2 m urea was electrophoresed using a semi-native version of BN-PAGE, which included 2 m urea in the gel. Development of the resulting Western blots with mAbs against the individual nIF proteins showed seven major bands, some of which were immunoreactive with two of the mAbs. Based on the staining intensity and the relative mobilities of the various species, protein complexes 1 and 2 appeared to be hetero-oligomers of NFL with NFH and NFM, respectively, whereas complex 4 in the anti-NFL lane appeared to be an NFL dimer. Complex 3 in the anti-NFH lane was likely the hypophosphorylated NFH-containing equivalent of complex 1 since it was much more prominent in extracts from the cell body-enriched fraction obtained from localized DRG cultures (data not shown), which we have shown to contain mostly this form of NFH (6Athlan E.S. Sacher M.S. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The broad region designated as 6 contained species staining with mAbs against NFL, α-internexin, and peripherin, suggesting the presence of homo- and/or heterodimers. Complex 4 in the anti-NFM lane, complex 5 in the anti-NFL lane, and complex 7 in the anti-peripherin lane could not be identified unambiguously. Initial cross-linking studies with further resolution in a second SDS-PAGE dimension appeared to confirm some of the associations described above, and further studies were undertaken to fully characterize these and other small nIF protein complexes. This was achieved by mixing various combinations of individually purified nIF subunits in the presence of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, dialyzing against buffered 2 m urea, and resolving the resulting complexes on semi-native BN-PAGE gels prepared with the same buffer as the dialysis solutions. As shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 1 and3), purified NFH and NFM migrated on 2 murea-BN-PAGE as single bands with apparent molecular masses of 260 and 214 kDa, respectively. Heating to 56 °C prior to electrophoresis did not affect their mobility (lanes 2 and 4), indicating that NFH and NFM migrated as monomers in this gel system with anomalously high apparent molecular masses, as is also observed on SDS-PAGE (32Kaufmann E. Geisler N. Weber K. FEBS Lett. 1984; 170: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Gradual increases in the gel urea concentration to 8m failed to produce smaller species, confirming the identity of the NFH and NFM bands as monomers (data not shown). NFL dialyzed and resolved on 2 m urea-BN-PAGE (Fig. 2,lane 5) yielded two bands with apparent molecular masses of 226 and 94 kDa. Heating the dialyzed NFL to 56 °C prior to electrophoresis (lane 6) converted almost all of the larger species to the more rapidly migrating form. Disulfide cross-linking of the NFL homo-oligomer through the unique cysteine residue in the α-helical domain (14Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 50: 475-490Google Scholar) using CuP2 (3Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) did not alter the migration pattern (lane 7) and effectively protected a significant portion of the NFL 226-kDa species from heat-induced conversion to the 94-kDa species (lane 8), indicating that these were homodimers and monomers, respectively. The CuP2-induced cross-links could be broken by including 10 mm DTT in the heated samples (lane 9), as would be expected for disulfide bonds. When mixtures of NFL with NFH or NFM were analyzed by 2 murea-BN-PAGE, the bands previously identified in the lanes containing these proteins alone were all present. In addition, new complexes appeared with apparent molecular masses of 360 kDa for the NFH/NFL mixture (Fig. 2, lane 10) and 328 kDa for the NFM/NFL mixture (lane 15), indicating the formation of NFH/NFL and NFM/NFL hetero-oligomers under these conditions. As was seen with the NFL homodimer, these hetero-oligomers were heat-labile (lanes 11and 16); they could be stabilized by CuP2cross-linking (lanes 13 and 18); and the disulfide cross-links were reduced with DTT (lanes 14 and19). Given the apparent anomalous migration of nIF proteins in this gel system and because both NFH and NFM each contain more than one cysteine residue (30Napolitano E.W. Chin S.S.M. Colman D.R. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2590-2599PubMed Google Scholar, 31Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3714-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), two complementary approaches were used to confirm that the hetero-oligomers formed between NFL and NFH or NFM were heterodimers. In Fig. 3, triplicate samples of NFH/NFL (panel A) and NFM/NFL (panel B) hetero-oligomers were prepared and resolved essentially as described for Fig. 2. The large amount of material used allowed direct visualization of all protein species in the first (2 murea-BN-PAGE) dimension as they appeared as Coomassie Blue G-250-stained bands against a lighter blue background. The protein bands were excised, briefly equilibrated with SDS sample buffer, resolved in the second dimension by discontinuous SDS-PAGE alongside standardized mixtures of NF subunits, visualized by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining, and quantified with the BioImager apparatus. As shown in Fig. 3, the NFH/NFL and NFM/NFL hetero-oligomers purified by BN-PAGE in the first dimension broke down in the second SDS-containing dimension to give essentially equimolar amounts of NFH and NFL (ratio = 1.16 ± 0.02) or NFM and NFL (ratio = 1.06 ± 0.02) (mean ± S.D.). These results clearly demonstrate that the observed hetero-oligomers are equimolar assemblies of their NF subunit constituents. In Fig. 4, NFH/NFL (panel A) and NFM/NFL (panel B) hetero-oligomers were formed, cross-linked, and resolved by 2 m urea-BN-PAGE essentially as described for Fig. 2. Some lanes were blotted onto a PVDF membrane and reacted with the anti-NF mAbs to reveal the positions of the various protein complexes in the first dimension as indicated at the top of Fig 4. Other lanes were cut out of the gels, equilibrated with SDS sample buffer without reducing agent, and electrophoresed in the second dimension on a Weber and Osborn-type gel (27Weber K. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which provided a better estimate of the molecular mass of cross-linked proteins than was obtained with Laemmli-type gels (data not shown), as previously reported (3Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Carden M.J. Eagles P.A.M. Biochem.

Following transfer to a PVDF membrane, the blots were probed with an anti-NFL mAb (Fig. 4, lower portions of panels A and B), erased, and reprobed with an anti-NFH mAb (upper portion of panel A) or an anti-NFM mAb (upper portion of panel B). The cross-linked NFH/NFL hetero-oligomer seen in the first (2m urea-BN-PAGE) dimension (H/L) resolved into three bands in the second SDS-PAGE dimension. The spot labeledH/L in the second dimension reacted with both anti-NFH and anti-NFL mAbs (upper and lower portions ofpanel A, respectively), confirming its heteromeric character. Non-cross-linked NFH (H) and NFL (L) were also present in this second dimension, as could be expected from examining the heated cross-linked samples in Fig. 2 (lanes 13and 18). Homodimeric NFL from the cross-linked sample seen in the first dimension (L/L) gave rise to some cross-linked (L/L) and monomeric (L) NFL in the second dimension, whereas the NFH and NFL species that were monomeric in the first dimension (H and L) remained so in the second dimension (H and L). Similar results were obtained for the NFM/NFL mixture (panel B), although cross-linked dimeric NFL (L/L) could not be adequately resolved from monomeric NFM (M), apparently due to upward streaking of the latter. It was also observed that the relative amount of cross-linked hetero-oligomer was lower on the Weber and Osborn-type gels than would be predicted from the data in Fig. 2 (e.g. lanes 13 and 18). This was a reproducible yet unexplained limitation of this gel system that was not observed when second dimension electrophoresis was carried out in a discontinuous SDS-PAGE system (data not shown). The apparent molecular masses of the various species detected were determined and are listed in TableI. The values for cross-linked NFH/NFL, NFM/NFL, and NFL/NFL were within 3% of the summed molecular masses of their monomeric constituents, thereby confirming their dimeric character. Taken together, the results in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and in Table Iconclusively demonstrate that, under the conditions described here, NFH/NFL and NFM/NFL heterodimers and NFL/NFL homodimers are formed and can be resolved by 2 m urea-BN-PAGE.Table IRelative molecular masses of the various species resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis after cross-linking of NFH/NFL and NFM/NFL mixturesProtein speciesRelative molecular massPredicted molecular masskDakDaH·L complex308317M·L complex239246L·L complex158156H (monomeric)239M (monomeric)168L (monomeric)78The samples were cross-linked and resolved by BN-PAGE followed by SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legend to Fig. 4, H, M, and L denote the NF subunits NFH, NFM, and NFL, respectively. Open table in a new tab The samples were cross-linked and resolved by BN-PAGE followed by SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legend to Fig. 4, H, M, and L denote the NF subunits NFH, NFM, and NFL, respectively. In Fig. 5, α-internexin and peripherin were tested for their ability to dimerize alone or in combination with other nIF proteins. The experiments were carried out essentially as described for Fig. 2, except that cross-linking and heating of some species was omitted. Some of the previously characterized NF species are shown again to provide useful molecular mass landmarks. Based on the relative mobilities of the protein complexes, both α-internexin and peripherin formed homodimers (∼159 and ∼143 kDa in lanes 5 and 7, respectively) that broke down to the monomeric species upon heat treatment (∼73 and ∼66 kDa in lanes 6 and 8, respectively). The staining intensity of the heat-treated peripherin sample was reproducibly lower than that of the unheated sample (lanes 8and 7, respectively), apparently due to in-gel dimerization of the monomeric species, leading to extensive streaking and concomitant loss of signal. The significant amount of dimeric peripherin in the heated sample and the virtual absence of monomeric peripherin in all of the other peripherin-containing lanes (lanes 7, 9, and 14–16) confirm its very strong tendency to dimerize under the conditions used. The various dimeric species obtained when mixing α-internexin and peripherin (lane 9) could not be resolved adequately on these gels, and cross-linking experiments failed to show any heterodimeric interactions between these two proteins (data not shown). Based on the relative mobility of the protein complexes, heterodimers containing α-internexin or peripherin with NFH (∼356 kDa) or NFM (∼320 kDa) (lanes 10, 11, 14, and 15, respectively) were also observed. Although the relative yields of these heterodimers were much lower than those observed for the NFH/NFL and NFM/NFL species, markedly greater amounts could be generated by dialyzing and resolving the samples in 0.05 m urea instead of 2 m urea (data not shown). It is not known why the α-internexin/NFH and α-internexin/NFM heterodimers in Fig. 5migrated as doublets, although protein degradation seems unlikely since it was not observed in the purified subunit preparations (data not shown). Mixing α-internexin or peripherin with NFL produced heterodimers that could not be resolved from the α-internexin and peripherin homodimers (lanes 12 and 16, respectively). However, erasure of the Western blot and reprobing with an anti-NFL mAb alone clearly revealed the presence of α-internexin/NFL (∼177 kDa in lane 13) and peripherin/NFL (∼167 kDa in lane 17) heterodimers. We recently reported that α-internexin, peripherin, and the NF triplet proteins in cultured DRG neurons are associated (6Athlan E.S. Sacher M.S. Mushynski W.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), thereby raising questions regarding the assembly stage during which such heteromeric associations can take place. Characterization of IF protein dimers has been hampered by a lack of practical and widely accessible techniques for resolving small oligomeric assembly intermediates. We have now shown that the recently reported BN-PAGE procedure (21Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), modified to include urea, can provide direct and unambiguous separation of nIF protein complexes and allows multiple combinations of nIF proteins to be resolved in parallel. To this end, Fig. 2 provides direct evidence for heterodimer formation between NFL and NFH or NFM, whereas Fig. 5 further shows heterodimeric associations between α-internexin or peripherin and the individual NF subunits. Small IF assembly intermediates have been generated by a variety of means, all revolving around the use of low ionic strength buffers, sometimes containing urea or guanidine in the 2–3 m range. Such buffers have been used either as a diluent of whole IFs (16Carden M.J. Eagles P.A.M. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or as the dialysis component for limited reassembly of IF proteins from concentrated guanidine or urea solutions (3Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 4Hatzfeld M. Weber K. J.

IF protein oligomers generated under these conditions have been considered to be valid assembly intermediates since addition of physiological salt concentrations coupled with removal of urea or guanidine, if required, leads to the formation of normal-appearing IFs. Moreover, reassembly of NFs (37Zackroff R.V. Idler W.W. Steinert P.M. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Liem R.K.H.

Neuron. 1989; 2: 1435-1445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 39Kaplan M.P. Chin S.S.M. Fliegner K.H. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2735-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and peripherin (40Parysek L.M. Goldman R.D. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 781-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from urea-containing buffers has been well documented. More specifically, NFL and NFM have been successfully co-assembled into native-like filaments by stepwise dialysis from guanidine solution to a physiological buffer, including an intermediate step involving a buffered 2 m urea solution similar to ours (20Cohlberg J.A. Hajarian H. Tran T. Alipourjeddi P. Noveen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9334-9339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that other nIF protein oligomers formed under such conditions would be valid assembly intermediates. A previous report described the resolution of NF subunit heterotetramers containing equimolar amounts of NFL with NFH or NFM on “native” gels containing 2 m urea (20Cohlberg J.A. Hajarian H. Tran T. Alipourjeddi P. Noveen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9334-9339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, our study using the BN-PAGE system revealed that dimers were the predominant species under similar conditions. It is possible that the presence of Coomassie Blue G-250 destabilizes tetrameric species, thus favoring the dimers that we observed, although such effects were not reported by Schägger et al. (21Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the bovine material used by Cohlberg et al. (20Cohlberg J.A. Hajarian H. Tran T. Alipourjeddi P. Noveen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9334-9339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) may form complexes that are more stable in 2 m urea than those formed by the rat nIF proteins utilized in our work. However, neither of these possibilities affects the present conclusions relating to heterodimer formation. NFH and NFM did not interact with themselves (Figs. 2 and 5) or with each other (data not shown), consistent with the many reports indicating that NFM and NFH do not assemble or co-assemble significantly in vitro (37Zackroff R.V. Idler W.W. Steinert P.M. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 754-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Liem R.K.H. Hutchison S.B.

Xu Z. Wong P.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 12Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and further indicating that the interactions we did observe were not likely to be due to nonspecific interactions between related α-helical rod domains. The first step in IF assembly involves the formation of an unstaggered parallel coiled-coil dimer (2Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 42Parry D.A.D. Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 1012-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Residues in positions aand d in the heptad repeats making up the α-helices are believed to form inward facing hydrophobic seams, whereas the other residues face outward (reviewed in Ref. 43Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). NFL contains a unique cysteine residue located in a d position within a heptad repeat in the rod domain (14Chin S.S.M. Liem R.K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 50: 475-490Google Scholar). Disulfide cross-linking of NFL homodimers and other IF protein dimers sharing this conserved residue has been well documented and has provided an important argument favoring the unstaggered parallel coiled-coil model of IF homodimer structure (3Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 43Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). However, disulfide bond formation between NFL and NFH or NFM under the conditions used here is somewhat puzzling. Indeed, the location of the closest cysteine residue in the rod domain of NFH in the linker region L2, 70 residues removed from the cysteine residue in NFL, appears to preclude an unstaggered alignment of these proteins. A similar problem involves the cysteine in NFM occupying thea position in a heptad, 41 residues away from the cysteine in NFL. Yet, Fig. 3 clearly demonstrated that cross-linked NFL/NFH and NFL/NFM dimers can be resolved as such in the 2 murea-BN-PAGE dimension, raising the possibility that, in contrast to other IF proteins characterized so far (1Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 2Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 593-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar, 3Quinlan R.A. Hatzfeld M. Franke W.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 42Parry D.A.D. Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 1012-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), NF subunits associated in a coiled-coil heterodimer may be in a staggered arrangement. This interpretation appears unlikely considering that some twisting of the helices would also be required to adequately align the cysteine residues involved in the cross-linking of NFM or NFH to NFL. A more likely explanation may be that the 2 m urea-containing buffer used here allows for slippage and flexibility within the coiled-coil structure, which would permit interactions between cysteine residues that are widely separated in the normal unstaggered alignment. According to this view, the mobility of subunits in such loosely assembled coiled-coil dimers would still allow for more efficient intradimer cross-linking compared with cross-linking between unassembled random collision complexes, which were never observed in these experiments. α-Internexin and peripherin were shown in Fig. 5 to form heterodimers with NFH or NFM, suggesting that co-assembly of these proteins can take place at the dimer level. The comparatively greater propensity for NFL to form heterodimers with NFH and NFM further suggests that it is the preferred partner for these proteins. However, heterodimeric association of α-internexin or peripherin with the NF subunits may be important for cytoskeletal reorganization during development and axonal regeneration. α-Internexin is the predominant nIF protein in developing central neurons (39Kaplan M.P. Chin S.S.M. Fliegner K.H. Liem R.K.H. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2735-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Fliegner K.H. Kaplan M.P. Wood T.L. Pintar J.E. Liem R.K.H. J. Comp. Neurol. 1994; 342: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas peripherin expression is up-regulated in regenerating large-caliber NF-containing peripheral axons (45Wong J. Oblinger M.M.J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 27: 332-341Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In both instances, these α-internexin- or peripherin-containing networks are presumed to confer greater plasticity as reflected in the dynamic nature of the growing axon (46Nixon R.A. Shea T.B. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The ability of NF proteins to dimerize with α-internexin and peripherin could play an important role in allowing a gradual transition to take place from a more plastic α-internexin- or peripherin-containing network to a stable NF-enriched IF network in the mature axon (47Giasson B.I. Mushynski W.E. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 229: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The modified version of BN-PAGE described here is a widely accessible, economical, and versatile method that allows several different samples to be analyzed in parallel. Future work in our laboratory will focus on monitoring early nIF protein assembly intermediates and on assessing the effects of mutations or post-translational modifications known or suspected to affect IF assembly.

https://openalex.org/W1998035894,"Organelle compartments are used by cells as reservoirs of exchangeable Ca2+ and as Ca2+ buffers. The following study uses recombinant aequorins (CYT-AEQ and MT-AEQ) to measure the dynamics of Ca2+ flux between organelles in procyclic forms of the pathogenic protozoan, Trypanosoma brucei. Emphasis is placed on the exchange between an acidic Ca2+ reservoir and the mitochondrion. The mammalian mitochondrial targeting sequence was functional in trypanosomes as determined by immunoblots, immunolocalizations, and the observation that MT-AEQ was in a compartment whose Ca2+ uptake was inhibited 82% with carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and KCN. The resting level of free calcium ion concentration in the mitochondrion ([Ca2+]mit) was slightly higher than that in the cytoplasm ([Ca2+]cyt) (400 +/- 50 nM and 290 +/- 40 nM, respectively). Melittin (125 nM) disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis by inducing Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. [Ca2+]cyt became slightly elevated to 410 +/- 100 nM, whereas [Ca2+]mit was selectively increased approximately 12-fold, with a broad peak at 4.8 +/- 1.9 microM. At the peak, the mitochondrion contained approximately three times more free Ca2+ than the cytosol. However, mitochondrial retention of the Ca2+ was transient. Similar selective transport into the mitochondrion was observed when Ca2+ efflux from an acidic compartment was induced with monensin (2 microg/ml) in the presence of 5 mM EGTA. [Ca2+]cyt was transiently elevated to 400 +/- 50 nM, whereas [Ca2+]mit was elevated to 3.3+/-1.3 microM. When cells were treated sequentially with monensin (2 microg/ml) and then melittin (200 nM), mitochondrial Ca2+ transport was normal. However, [Ca2+]cyt became elevated to a level that was 1.4-fold higher than with melittin alone. Overall, these data demonstrate that the trypanosome mitochondrion is not a reservoir of exchangeable Ca2+ in the resting cell. However, Ca2+ is selectively channeled to the mitochondrion from the plasma membrane or acidic Ca2+ storage compartment. Additionally, the acidic compartment contributes to maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis in response to melittin."
https://openalex.org/W2060865841,"The tumor-promoting phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), acutely stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of approximately 190, 120, and 70 kDa in the well differentiated Fao rat hepatoma cell line. This phosphorylation is dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) and is abolished by down-regulation of PKC or pretreatment with a PKC inhibitor. Purification of the 190-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein revealed that it consists of both ErbB2 and ErbB3. Following PMA-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, ErbB2 and ErbB3 were able to associate with the SH2 domains of several signaling proteins including the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Syp, and Grb2. The 120-kDa protein phosphorylated in response to PMA consists of at least two proteins: focal adhesion kinase that exhibits a minor increase in tyrosine phosphorylation following treatment with PMA, and a major 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated species in PMA-stimulated Fao cells which as yet is unidentified. Similarly, the 70-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein also appears to represent more than one protein, including paxillin and a second protein of similar mobility which appears to be the major tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PMA. Both ErbB2 and paxillin also exhibit reduced migration on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis following PMA treatment, suggesting that they are also phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues. The mobility shift of both of these proteins is abolished by treatment with inhibitors of PKC or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-related kinase kinase. These results suggest a novel mechanism of cross-talk between the serine/threonine kinase PKC and tyrosine phosphorylation pathways. The activation of ErbB2 and ErbB3 that is initiated by PMA may contribute to the tumor promoting activity of these compounds."

Future invesitgations will need to determine the exact substrate specificity of this novel peptidase. Intestinal reclamation of conjugated bile salts occurs primarily on the apical surface of ileal enterocytes by sodium-dependent carrier-mediated uptake (1Lack L. Weiner I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1961; 200: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Schiff E.R. Small N.C. Dietschy J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1972; 51: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling studies of ileal brush border membrane vesicles and of ileal enterocytes had implicated a 99-kDa protein in that process (3Kramer W. Burckhardt G. Wilson F.A. Kurz G. J. Biol.

Strategies to identify and clone the rat ileal sodium-dependent bile acid transporter included bile acid affinity chromatography (4Shneider B. Ananthanarayanan M. Moyer M. Insler N. Suchy F. Gastroenterology. 1991; 100: 796Google Scholar) and ultimately expression cloning and hybridization (5Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Craddock A.L. Dawson P.A. J. Biol.

Drain P. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 862: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that incorporated two critical features for bile acid binding, namely a trihydroxysteroid nucleus and a monoanionic side chain (8Marcus S.N. Schteingart C.D. Marquez M.L. Hofmann A.F. Xia Y. Steinbach J.H. Ton-Nu H.-T. Lillienau J. Angellotti M.A. Schmassmann A.

In the course of studies to purify the ileal sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, a unique ileal 100-kDa protein was isolated and cloned. In this study, we identify this novel ileal protein as a peptidase that has dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity. Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250-g males) were obtained from Charles River (Raleigh, NC) and were exposed to 12-h day/night cycles. Animals were housed, fed, and handled according to the protocol approved by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and under a protocol approved by the Yale Animal Care and Use Committee. Human tissues were obtained under a protocol approved by the Clinical Practices Committee of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine. Standard DNA and amino acid sequence analyses were performed using either the Genetics Computing Group software package (Madison, WI) or software available through the National Center for Biotechnology and Information (Bethesda, MD). The I100 protein was initially isolated based upon its ability to bind to an anionic glycocholate-Sepharose 4B affinity column (7von Dippe P. Ananthanarayanan M. Drain P. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 862: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Ileal brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) 1The abbreviations used are: BBMV, brush border membrane vesicles; I100, ileal 100-kDa protein; MDCK, Madin Darby canine kidney; OGS,n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; 5′-RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DPP IV, dipeptidyl peptidase IV; NAALADase, N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase; NAAG, N-acylaspartylglutamate; PSM, prostate-specific membrane antigen; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; bp, base pair(s). were prepared from rat ileum by divalent cation precipitation as described previously (10Shneider B.L. Michaud G.A. West A.B. Suchy F.J. Pediat. Res. 1993; 33: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Approximately 2–4 mg of these ileal BBMV were solubilized in 50 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (OGS), 1 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, for 2.5 h at 4 °C and spun at 100,000 × g; then, the supernatant was diluted to 15 mm OGS before applying to the bile acid affinity column. The bound proteins were eluted from the affinity column with 50 mm OGS, dialyzed against 25 mm NH4HCO3, 0.05% SDS, and then lyophilized (Fig. 1). The resulting affinity-purified protein was further purified by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar). The band of protein(s) of approximately 100 kDa molecular mass was excised from the gel, and the proteins were electroeluted using an Elutrap electroseparation system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Schleicher & Schuell). The final protein preparation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits by subcutaneous and intramuscular injections of approximately 25 μg of the 100-kDa protein mixed in RIBI adjuvant (RIBI Immunochemicals, Hamilton, MT). Injections were performed on days 0, 19, and 35, and serum was obtained by ear vein bleeding on day 45. The 100-kDa antibody was initially characterized by Western blotting and indirect immunofluoresence. Western blotting was performed by standard techniques using 100 μg of ileal BBMV and either a 1:500 or 1:2500 dilution of preimmune or immune serum, respectively (12Towbin H.T. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4351-4354Crossref Scopus (44916) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescent detection of the 100-kDa protein in rat ileal sections was performed as described, except Triton X-100 was omitted as a permeabilizing agent (6Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 1:100 dilution of immune serum or 1:50 dilution of preimmune serum was utilized. Triton X-114 countercurrent phase partitioning studies were utilized to assess whether the 100-kDa protein was an integral membrane protein (13Bordier C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1604-1607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Swanson M.L. Keast R.K. Jennings M.L. Pessin J.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 229-234PubMed Google Scholar). 750 μg of ileal BBMV were partitioned. The final aqueous and detergent phases were mixed with a 4 × SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer to yield 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and were analyzed by Western blotting using the 100-kDa polyclonal antibody. Deglycosylation experiments were carried out as described previously (6Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of denatured ileal BBMV were treated with 0.6 units of N-glycanase (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) overnight at 37 °C and were then analyzed by Western blotting using the I100 antibody. The specificity of I100 binding to the anionic glycocholate-Sepharose 4B affinity column was determined by elution of the bound proteins with increasing concentrations of taurocholate. Ileal BBMV were solubilized as described above and applied to the anionic glycocholate-Sepharose 4B affinity column. After equilibration and binding to the column, proteins were eluted with increasing concentrations (0.10–1.0 mm) of sodium taurocholate in 15 mm OGS, 1m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Finally, the column was stripped of residually bound proteins using 50 mm OGS. Pools of eluted proteins were dialyzed against 25 mmNH4HCO3, 0.05% SDS and then lyophilized. The lyophilized proteins were solubilized in 1.37 m glycerol, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, .07 m SDS, 0.06m Tris, pH 6.8, and were analyzed by Western blotting. I100 antibodies were affinity purified using ileal BBMV proteins as antigen. 3.5 mg of ileal BBMV were separated by preparative one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. The filter was blocked with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100 (TBSA), and a region of the membrane was excised that encompassed proteins that migrated with an apparent mass of 100 kDa. This membrane strip was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 20 ml of a 1:20 dilution of immune serum in TBSA. After several washes with TBSA, the bound antibody was released with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.8, neutralized with 1m Tris, pH 8.0, and concentrated using a Centricon-100 device (Amicon, Beverly, MA). This purified antibody was then used to immunoprecipitate the 100-kDa protein from 0.75 mg of ileal BBMV protein that had been solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.8% bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4). Antigen-antibody complexes were captured with protein A-Sepharose and eluted from the Sepharose by boiling in 25% glycerol, 1.4m β-mercaptoethanol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 120 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8. The immunopurified 100-kDa protein was resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and stained with Coomassie Blue. The protein was excised and subjected to automated Edman degradation to yield N-terminal sequence at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (15$$Google Scholar). The I100 cDNA was cloned by conventional antibody screening of a rat ileal λ Zap II library kindly provided by Raymond DuBois (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Nonspecific immunoglobulin binding was reduced by preincubating the filters with a 1:500 dilution of guinea pig serum in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. A 1:1000 dilution of Escherichia coli/phage lysate precleared immune serum was used to screen 0.5 × 106 colonies. Positive colonies were detected using the pico Blue immunoscreening kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Clones that were positive on tertiary screening were directly subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ using the ExAssist/SOLR system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). Positive clones were sequenced on both strands at the William Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University using a series of oligonucleotide primers,AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, and an ABI 373A automated sequencing system (ABI, Foster City, CA) (16Connell C. Fung S. Heiner C. Bridgham J. Chakerian V. Heron E. Jones B. Menchen S. Mordan W. Raff M. et al.Biotechniques. 1987; 5: 342-348Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed using software of the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI). The 5′-end of the I100 cDNA was cloned by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (17Frohman M. Dush M. Martin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar) using the 5′ AmpliFinder RACE kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). I100 specific cDNA was synthesized from ileal poly(A)+ RNA using an antisense primer located at nucleotide 652 of clone BS15C1 (CAGTGTACACCAGCACTCC). The initial polymerase chain reaction utilized an anchor primer and an oligonucleotide beginning at nucleotide 252 (CAGCAGCAGCTGCACCAGGGC), which was nested within the primer used for cDNA synthesis. Reamplification was performed with the same primers, and the resulting product was subcloned into a TA subcloning vector (Invitrogen). A λ GT10 human ileal cDNA library (18Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27228-27234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) was screened by standard plaque hybridization techniques using a random hexamer-primed32P-labeled I100 cDNA probe (KpnI/EcoRI digest of clone BS15C1; utilizing both fragments for labeling, i.e. nucleotides 1–1315 and 1316–2512). Hybridization was performed for 18 h at 42 °C in buffer containing 30% (v/v) formamide, 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. After hybridization, filters were washed to a final stringency of 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. Positive clones were plaque purified, and plate lysate DNA was isolated (19Xu S.Y. Gene Anal. Tech. 1986; 3: 90-91Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pBluescript KS II (Stratagene). The tissue distribution of the I100 mRNA was assessed by Northern blotting of total RNA from rat liver, kidney, ileum, jejunum, colon, placenta, brain, heart, and lung. The localization of the I100 transcript along the longitudinal axis of the intestine was then assessed by Northern blotting of total RNA from the esophagus, stomach, deciles of the small intestine, cecum, and proximal and distal halves of the colon. RNA loading of the blots was assessed by 28 S ribosomal oligonucleotide hybridization (20Barbu V. Dautry F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of human I100 was performed using 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from human liver, cecum, and ileum and a human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH), which were hybridized with a random hexamer-primed 32P-labeled human I100 cDNA (Human 1, Fig. 6, corresponding to nucleotides 1315–1800 of I100). The I100 cDNA was subcloned into a TA-based eukaryotic expression vector (InVitrogen) for functional analysis. Nested primers were designed to the 5′- and 3′-untranslated portions (sense 1, GCCCCGCGGCACAGGATGCACTGGGCGAAAATAC; sense 2, CAGGATGCACTGGGCGAAAATAC; antisense 1, GAGAAACAGGTGCAAGAGGTGC; antisense 2, GAAAAGGCCCCAGGGACAGGGC) of I100, and a full-length I100 cDNA was prepared by nested reverse transcription-PCR using rat ileal RNA as a template. The reverse transcription-PCR product was subcloned into the bidirectional eukaryotic expression vector, and the properly oriented I100 cDNA was sequenced in its entirety. PCR-induced mutations were obtained in all full-length clones. To obtain a mutation-free I100 expression plasmid, a BsgI fragment (nucleotides 301–1586) from BS15C1 was subcloned into one of the RT-PCR-based expression constructs. The full-length I100 expression construct was then used to transiently transfect COS-7 cells and to stably transfect MDCK cells. COS-7 cells were transfected overnight with the I100 eukaryotic expression constructs (1.0 μg/well (12-well plate)) by the lipofectin method (3.5 μg of lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1.0 μg of plasmid). Untransfected cells were exposed to lipofectin and treated similarly to the transfected ones. Approximately 60–72 h after transfection, the COS-7 cells were lysed in 100 μl of 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Sodium-dependent taurocholate uptake was determined 72 h post-transfection by incubating transfected COS-7 cells with 1.0 μm[3H]taurocholate in 0.5 ml of 116 mm NaCl (or 116 mm choline chloride), 5.3 mm KCl, 1.1 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mmMg2SO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 11 mmd-dextrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). After incubating for 15 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed three times with 1.0 ml of ice-cold choline containing incubation buffer and lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 in water. Aliquots were taken to determine cell-associated protein and radioactivity. The same assay was also used to assess sodium-dependent taurocholate uptake in untransfected MDCK and MDCK cells stably transfected with the I100 expression construct (below). MDCK-I cells were transfected overnight with the I100 eukaryotic expression construct (5.0 μg of plasmid and 18 μl of lipofectin in 5.0 ml of Opti-MEM reduced serum media). On day 6, the cells were split 1:5 in media containing 0.9 mg/ml Geneticin (G418) and transferred to 100-mm dishes. Stably transfected neomycin-resistant colonies were picked with the aid of cloning cylinders and transferred to 22-mm wells containing 1.0 ml of media containing G418. The neomycin-resistant colonies were lysed in 1.0% SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to determine the presence and confirm the size of the expressed protein. Preliminary analysis of cell membrane expression was performed by cell surface labeling. Pilot studies were performed by labeling rat ileal BBMV with sulfo-NHS biotin (Pierce), and the 100-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal antibody. Briefly, 3 mg of rat ileal BBMV were suspended in PBS, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2(PBSCM) and allowed to react with 1 mg of sulfo-NHS biotin in a final volume of 3 ml at 4 °C for 30 min. Unreacted sulfo-NHS biotin was removed by washing the vesicles repeatedly with PBSCM. The vesicles were then solubilized by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min in immunoprecipitation buffer (IP) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and insoluble proteins were removed by centrifugation at 150,000 ×g. I100 protein immunoprecipitation was performed in IP buffer containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin and a 1:100 dilution of either immune or preimmune serum. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose and washed repeatedly with IP buffer containing 0.05% SDS. The immunoprecipitate was released with 4 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin and chloronapthol as a visualizing agent. Cell surface labeling of the MDCK cells was performed with modifications of the procedure utilized for BBMV essentially as described by Wong et al.(18Wong M.H. Oelkers P. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27228-27234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The cellular localization of the I100 protein in the stably transfected MDCK cells was further assessed by indirect immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. Untransfected and stably transfected MDCK cells were grown on Transwell filters (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in MEM-E medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin until they just reached confluence (3–4 days). Cells were washed with PBS and fixedin situ with 100% acetone for 20 min. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with normal goat serum for 60 min to block nonspecific staining. Labeling was achieved by exposing the cells to a 1:1000 dilution of the polyclonal antibody in PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum for 60 min at room temperature. The cells were extensively washed with PBS and incubated in the dark for 30 min with Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Life Sciences), diluted 1:500 in PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After three final washes with PBS, the filters were mounted on glass slides with the cells facing upward, covered with Crystal/mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA) and coverslipped. Confocal microscopy was performed with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 scanning laser microscope attached to a standard microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with a Leitz 50 × water immersion lens (Leica, Inc., Deerfield, IL). For Z section microscopy, the confocal aperture was set at its minimum section thickness (1 μm), and images were collected in 1.2-μm steps. Sodium-dependent uptake of taurocholate was assayed as described above using either untransfected MDCK cells or one stably transfected with the I100 expression construct. Dipeptidyl peptidase activity of the I100 protein was determined by fluorescent analysis (excitation at 380 nm and emission at 450 nm) of the hydrolysis of Gly-Pro 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Sigma) (21Blackman D.L. Watson A.J. Montrose M.H. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Assays were performed using I100 that was immunoprecipitated from rat ileal BBMV or by analysis of stably transfected MDCK cells. For the immunoprecipitation assays, 1 mg of BBMV was solubilized in 1 ml of IP buffer by stirring for 30 min. at 4 °C. The detergent extract was pipetted up and down with a 23-gauge needle 10 times and subsequently centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min. 100 μl of supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2.5 h at room temperature with a 1:166 dilution of either preimmune or immune rabbit serum (372 μl of IP buffer, 100 μl of BBMV supernatant, 25 μl of 10% BSA, and 3 μl of serum). Immune complexes were captured at 4 °C for 50 min with 50 μl of a 50% solution of protein A-Sepharose. The Sepharose beads were washed four times with 1.0 ml of IP buffer and then incubated with 2.0 ml of buffered substrate solution at room temperature for 60 min. The stably transfected MDCK cells were studied either as homogenates or as intact confluent cells. For homogenate analysis cultured cells were washed three times with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl. The cells were scraped with rubber policeman and lysed in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, by repeated aspiration through a 23-gauge needle and stored frozen at −70 °C. The enzyme activity was initiated by the addition of 13 μg of cell lysate from control or stably transfected MDCK-I cells to 2.0 ml of buffered substrate solution (50 mm Gly-Pro 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin in 150 mm glycine, pH 8.6). For analysis of intact cells, untransfected and I100 stably transfected MDCK cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes. The confluent monolayer of cells was washed twice with 1 × PBS and overlaid with 1.0 ml of buffered substrate solution for 15 min at 37 °C. Approximately 50% of the OGS solubilized ileal brush border membrane proteins were bound to the anionic glycocholate-Sepharose 4B affinity column and were eluted by a high concentration of OGS (Fig. 1). One-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis of the high detergent eluted fraction (peak 2) revealed protein with a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa, which was enriched in ileal but not jejunal BBMV (Fig. 1). The 100-kDa protein(s) was further purified by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and electroelution from excised gel slices (Fig. 1). Immune serum recognized a diffuse band of protein(s) at approximately 100 kDa when ileal BBMV were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.2 A). This band was not recognized by a 5-fold greater concentration of preimmune serum. The I100 protein was specifically immunoprecipitated from biotinylated rat ileal BBMVs (Fig. 2 B). By indirect immunofluorescent analysis of rat ileal sections, the I100 protein was localized to the brush border membrane of ileal villus enterocytes (Fig. 3). No brush border staining was observed using immune serum in proximal jejunum or using preimmune serum in ileum. Triton X-114 countercurrent phase partitioning studies revealed that the I100 protein was exclusively found in the detergent phase, which is consistent with it being an integral membrane protein (Fig. 4 A). After treatment with N-glycanase, the apparent molecular mass of I100 decreased by approximately 20 kDa, and I100 migrated as a single species of approximately 90 kDa (Fig. 4 B). The specificity of the binding to the anionic glycocholate-Sepharose 4B affinity column was determined by elution of the bound proteins with increasing concentrations of taurocholate. Western blot analysis of column fractions revealed that I100 protein could be eluted from the anionic glycocholate-Sepharose 4B affinity column with as little as 0.5 mm taurocholate (not shown) and was completely eluted from the column with 1.0 mm taurocholate (Fig.5).Figure 4Biochemical characterization of I100.

The I100 protein is detected by Western blotting in the detergent and not aqueous phase after Triton X-114 phase partitioning/countercurrent distribution.B, deglycosylation. After overnight treatment withN-glycanase, the I100 protein displays enhanced electrophoretic mobility (calculated molecular mass of 85–90 kDa) and is a discrete sharp band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5Specificity of the anionic glycocholate affinity chromatography. A, chromatogram of the elution profile of OGS-solubilized ileal brush border membrane proteins. 2 mg of proteins have been applied to an anionic glycocholate affinity column. Nonabsorbed proteins flow through into peak 1, relatively specifically bound proteins are eluted off with nonmicellar concentrations of taurocholate (TC) into peak 2, and residually nonspecifically bound proteins are stripped from the column into peak 3 using 50 mm OGS.A 600 nm refers to the absorbance of 600 nm of light after completion of the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). B, Western blot analysis of peaks 1–3. the fractions containing peaks 1–3 were pooled, vacuum dialyzed against 25 mmNH4HCO3, 0.05% SDS, and then lyophilized. The lyophilized proteins were solubilized in 1.37 m glycerol, 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.07 m SDS, 0.06m Tris, pH 6.8, and were analyzed by Western blot. Prestained standards can be seen in lane 4, while the majority of the I100 protein could be detected in proteins from peak 2 (lane 2), which were eluted off of the affinity column with 1.0 mm taurocholate in 12.5 mm OGS. Little if any I100 protein could be detected in either the nonabsorbed proteins (peak 1 = lane 3) or those residually bound proteins that were stripped from the column with 50 mm OGS (peak 3 = lane 1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Approximately 20 μg of I100 protein was purified by immunoprecipitation. N-terminal Edman degradation yielded the following unique primary sequence:XXX(S/A)KILGVGIX(S/A)XXLL. To obtain an I100 cDNA clone, a rat λ Zap II library was screened using immune serum. Nine distinct clones, ranging in size from 1.1 to 2.5 kilobases, were isolated. One of the clones, BS15C1, was sequenced completely on both strands, while two other clones were sequenced and found to be identical shorter fragments of BS15C1 (see Fig.6). PCR analysis of the remaining six clones revealed that they encoded homologous sequences. Clone BS15C1 contained a 2527-bp insert with a 2217-bp open reading frame. The clone encompassed a poly(A) tract that was 16 bp downstream of a consensus polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) (22Proudfoot N. Cell. 1991; 64: 671-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Translation of the open reading frame revealed sequence identity with the N-terminal peptide sequence; however, the BS15C1 cDNA clone was lacking the first six amino acids of the N-terminal peptide and the 5′-untranslated region. Rescreening the library with an I100 5′-end specific probe did not yield a more 5′ clone. Therefore, 5′-RACE was employed to obtain the missing 5′ sequence. A total of 54 separate 5′-RACE subclones were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestions and by analytical gel electrophoresis. Six clones were sequenced completely on both strands and contained open reading frames that were identical to the primary sequence of the I100 protein. Four clones extended to a presumed initiator methionine and one extended to an in-frame 5′ stop codon, which was 27 bp proximal to the initiator methionine triplet (Fig. 6). The predicted initiator methionine lies within an appropriate consensus for initiation of translation (23Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). The I100 cDNA was therefore presumed to be 2590 bp in length with an open reading frame encoding a 746-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 80,640 Da (Fig.7). Kyte Doolittle hydropathy analysis predicted a single potential membrane-spanning domain at the N terminus of the protein (24Kyte J."

Previous studies have shown that macrophage sterol content modulates apoE synthesis and secretion, associated with a large transcriptional response of the apoE gene. The current studies were undertaken to evaluate the existence of additional post-transcriptional regulatory loci for the effect of sterols on apoE synthesis and secretion. Using a macrophage cell line transfected to constitutively express an apoE cDNA to facilitate detection of a post-transcriptional regulatory locus, we demonstrated that preincubations in 25-hydroxycholesterol and cholesterol lead to increased apoE secretion in pulse/chase experiments. Examination of cell lysates in these experiments showed that apoE not secreted by control cells was degraded and not detectable, suggesting that the preincubation in sterols increased secretion by decreasing degradation of newly synthesized apoE. The measurement of total protein and apoE degradation in cell fractions revealed an intermediate density fraction that degraded significant amounts of newly synthesized total protein and newly synthesized apoE. In this fraction, degradation of total protein and apoE was unaffected by chloroquine but was substantially reduced by N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal plusN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methioninal or by lactacystin, suggesting the involvement of proteasomes. Preincubation in sterol/oxysterol or acetylated low density lipoprotein did not modify total protein degradation by this fraction but inhibited apoE degradation. Similar results were obtained using intermediate density fractions isolated from human monocyte-derived macrophages. The results of our studies indicate that newly synthesized apoE in the macrophage can be degraded in an intermediate density nonlysosomal cellular compartment, which is sensitive to proteasomal inhibitors. Alteration of cellular lipid homeostasis by preincubation in sterol/oxysterol or acetylated low density lipoprotein inhibits apoE, but not total protein, degradation in this fraction.

Inhibition of the degradation of apoE in this fraction likely contributes to the increased apoE secretion observed in sterol-enriched cells. Apolipoprotein E is synthesized by hepatic cells and a large number of extrahepatic cell types (1Mazzone T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). In the liver, apoE is produced as a surface constituent of lipoprotein particles and serves as a ligand for several cell membrane endocytic receptors found in liver and peripheral cells. In addition, apoE is a highly charged protein and has strong affinity for negatively charged proteoglycans, including those found on the cell surface. Consistent with this, apoE has been detected in a cell surface pool in hepatic cells and macrophages, where it may be involved in modulating cellular lipid and lipoprotein metabolism (3Lucas M.

The function of apoE synthesized in multiple extrahepatic cell types remains incompletely defined. In macrophages, the regulation of apoE gene expression and apoE secretion by small increments in cellular cholesterol mass led to the hypothesis that apoE could serve a role in macrophage cholesterol homeostasis, as part of a regulatory loop to reduce cellular free cholesterol content (8Mazzone T. Gump H. Diller P. Getz G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11657-11662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies confirmed such a role and indicated that expression of apoE in macrophages functions to enhance cholesterol efflux and reduce macrophage cholesterol stores in the presence and absence of extracellular acceptor particles (9Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Gaynor P.M. Gamble W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24511-24518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Mazzone T. Reardon C. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1345-1353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using genetically engineered mice and bone marrow transplantation technology have confirmed an important role for macrophage-derived apoE in modulating susceptibility to atherosclerosis (11Linton M.F.

Mice with a specific defect in macrophage apoE expression displayed a 10-fold increase in susceptibility to atherosclerosis while on a high fat diet (14Fazio S. Babaev V.R. Murray A.B. Hasty A.H.

Conversely, macrophage-specific expression of apoE has been shown to protect mice from the effect of atherogenic hyperlipidemia (13Bellosta S. Mahley R.W. Sanan D.A. Murata J. Newland D.L. Taylor J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2170-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). There are multiple properties of apoE which can be considered in evaluating the mechanism of such a protective effect (1Mazzone T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 2Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). However, modulation of macrophage cholesterol content by endogenously synthesized apoE probably contributes to this important role in determining susceptibility of the vessel wall to atherogenic insult. In light of the apparent importance of macrophage-derived apoE in vessel wall homeostasis, it is imperative to fully understand the regulation of apoE expression in macrophages. Sterol modulation of apoE synthesis and secretion has been demonstrated in multiple macrophage types, including human monocyte-derived macrophages and mouse peritoneal macrophages (8Mazzone T.

Previous studies have indicated that sterol modulation of apoE synthesis and secretion is associated with a substantial increase in apoE gene transcription, with reports showing up to a 10-fold increase in apoE mRNA levels with a similar increase in apoE gene transcription rates (15Mazzone T. Basheeruddin K. Poulos C. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current studies, we wished to address the issue of a potential post-transcriptional site for modulation of apoE secretion by sterols. A post-translational site was of particular interest based on previous observations that a significant portion of newly synthesized apoE in the macrophage is degraded prior to its release from the cell (19Mazzone T. Pustelnikas L. Reardon C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1081-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To approach this issue, we reasoned that a post-transcriptional and post-translational effect would be more easily demonstrable in cells in which the large transcriptional response of the apoE gene to sterols could not obscure other potential regulatory loci. We therefore utilized a J774 cell macrophage model, which was transfected to constitutively express a human apoE cDNA. Expression of the apoE cDNA in this cell line is mediated by the human metallothionine IIa promoter and has been previously characterized in detail (3Lucas M. Mazzone T. J. Biol.

Cells were selected and maintained in G418 (400 μg/dl) until 1 week prior to the initiation of experiments. Cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium until the start of the described experimental incubations. Freshly isolated human monocytes were purified by elutriation. The elutriated cell population used for experiments was >95% monocytic, as determined by differential counts of Wright-stained smears. Human monocyte macrophages were plated and grown as described previously (21Hongwei D. Li Z. Mazzone T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with sterols dissolved in ethanol vehicle (final concentration < 0.5%). Control cultures were incubated in equivalent amounts of vehicle only. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cultures to be fractionated on continuous sucrose gradients were washed two times and scraped from the culture flasks with a rubber policeman in 5 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1m sucrose and incubated on ice for 20 min to swell the cells. Cell suspensions were homogenized using 100 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and the sucrose concentration of the cell homogenate was adjusted to 20%. A linear sucrose gradient was prepared by mixing 6 ml of 20% sucrose (mixed with the cell homogenate) and 5.5 ml of 56% sucrose and centrifuging at 35,000 rpm for 18 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor, as described previously (22Lange Y. Muraski M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9366-9373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eleven fractions of equal volume were collected from the bottom of the tube, and the density of the fractions was monitored by comparing the refractive index of each fraction with a standard curve of density versus refractive index. Fractions were assayed immediately for marker enzyme activity. Recovery of enzyme activity and total labeled protein approximated 70% on these gradients. Isolation of intermediate density, nonlysosomal cell fractions was based on previously published methods (23Croze E.M. Morre D.J. J. Cell.

Cultures to be fractionated were washed two times and scraped from the culture flasks with a rubber policeman in homogenizing medium (37.5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m sucrose, 1% dextran, 5 mm MgC12, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 6.5). Cells in suspension were homogenized using 100 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 2,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor for 5 min, followed by 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The upper one-half of the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of homogenizing medium and then layered onto 9 ml of ice-cold 1.2 m sucrose and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for another 30 min in a SW41 rotor. Two closely spaced opaque bands at the interface were recovered with a Pasteur pipette and diluted 20-fold with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline. Lysosomes were removed by centrifuging at 5,000 rpm for 20 min in a SW41 rotor and recovering the pellets. Pelleted membranes were assayed immediately for marker enzyme activity.

ApoE was biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methonine (100–200 μCi/ml), and pulse-chase incubations were carried out as described previously. ApoE bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of immunoprecipitates were localized using a radiofluorescent image scanner and quantitated using ImageQuant software. Northern and Western blot signals were measured using a Molecular Dynamics laser densitometer with ImageQuant software. The method used to measure the degradation of total proteins or apoE in subcellular fractions was based on previously published methods (25Wang C.-N. Hobman T.C. Brindley D.N. J. Biol.

After isolation of fractions at 4 °C, equal aliquots were mixed with half volumes of 0.4 m sodium potassium phosphate (pH 6.8) containing 8 mm dithiothreitol. Equal portions of each fraction were then incubated for an additional 3 h at 40 °C or kept at 4 °C. At the end of that time, total labeled protein was measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and apoE was measured by Western blot hybridization or immunoprecipitation. The difference between the amount of protein present in a fraction after incubation at 40versus 4 °C was taken as the amount degraded during the 3-h incubation period. ApoE in immunoprecipitates and Western blots was quantitated, as detailed above, using ImageQuant software. The amount of apoE present at the end of the 4 °C incubation was assigned a value of 100%, and the amount at the end of the 40 °C incubation was expressed as a fraction of the 4 °C value. In our experiments, the percentage of apoE degraded ranged from 68 to 73% in control cells and from 27 to 43% in sterol-treated cells. Protein, free cholesterol, cholesterol ester, and phospholipid were measured as described previously (3Lucas M. Mazzone T. J. Biol.

Galactosyltransferase (Golgi marker), acid phosphatase (lysosomal marker), 5′-nucleotidase (plasma membrane marker), and cytochrome c reductase (ER marker) were assayed as described previously (22Lange Y.

We first wished to evaluate apoE mRNA levels in response to this experimental preincubation to confirm the absence of a transcriptional response and eliminate the possibility that post-transcriptional stabilization of apoE mRNA levels occurred in response to the sterol/oxysterol preincubation. The results of a Northern blot hybridization, shown in Fig. 1, indicate that 24-h preincubations in sterol/oxysterol produced no change in apoE mRNA levels. We next conducted a series of pulse-chase experiments after a 24-h preincubation in sterol/oxysterol. The results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig.2. Cells preincubated in sterol/oxysterol show a 1.7-fold increase and a 1.5-fold increase in medium apoE after 30 and 60 min of chase, respectively. Comparable increases were observed in multiple experiments conducted in a similar manner. Examination of the cellular content of apoE at 0, 30, and 60 min of chase showed no difference. These results indicate that the preincubation in sterol/oxysterol could enhance apoE secretion at a translational or post-translational locus. The apoE that was not secreted in control cells did not appear to be retained within the cell and, therefore, was probably degraded. Given previous observations regarding the significant rate of degradation of newly synthesized apoE (19Mazzone T. Pustelnikas L. Reardon C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1081-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results were consistent with the hypothesis that the sterol/oxysterol preincubation modified the degradation rate for newly synthesized apoE and thereby enhanced its secretion. We therefore directly investigated the effect of the sterol/oxysterol incubation on the degradation rate of apoE.Figure 2Post-transcriptional modulation of apoE secretion by sterols. Cells were plated and grown as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the experiment, cells were incubated in growth medium alone or in the same medium with 1 μg/ml of 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH CH) and 10 μg/ml of cholesterol (CHOL) for 24 h prior to the start of a 30-min labeling period. Cultures were then chased for 30 or 60 min. Equal numbers of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable dpm were used for immunoprecipitation of apoE from cell culture media (upper panel) and cell lysates (lower panel) at 0, 30, and 60 min of chase time. ApoE was quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the values shown are the mean ± S.D. from triplicate cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addressing the potential for modification of apoE degradation by the sterol/oxysterol preincubation, we first wished to examine the subcellular distribution of apoE in control cells and cells preincubated in sterol/oxysterol and to determine which subcellular fractions were primarily responsible for degrading newly synthesized apoE. To study the subcellular distribution of newly synthesized apoE and the distribution of the activity for degrading it, macrophage cell homogenates were fractionated on 23–42% continuous sucrose gradients. On these gradients, the plasma membrane was contained in the three most buoyant fractions, the ER marker was found in the three densest fractions, and the lysosome and Golgi markers were found in five fractions of intermediate density and were incompletely resolved. A predominantly nonglycosylated isoform of apoE was recovered from the dense fractions containing ER, whereas larger glycosylated forms were easily detectable in Golgi/lysosome and plasma membrane fractions. Multiple experiments were performed utilizing cells harvested after a 30-min pulse label and no chase or after a 30-min pulse and 30-min chase period. We did not detect a consistently significant difference between the distribution of apoE in control cells and cells preincubated in sterol/oxysterol (not shown). We next assayed each of the fractions for its ability to degrade newly synthesized apoE. We found that 60–70% of total apoE degradation occurred in intermediate density fractions in both control and sterol/oxysterol-treated cells (not shown). We therefore undertook a more focused study of apoE degradation and the effect of sterols in an intermediate density cell fraction. An increasingly important role has been ascribed to nonlysosomal degradative pathways in the turnover of newly synthesized protein. We therefore undertook a set of studies to evaluate the role of a nonlysosomal intermediate density compartment in the macrophage for the degradation of newly synthesized apoE and evaluate whether apoE degradation in this compartment could be modulated by the sterol/oxysterol preincubation. This intermediate density fraction, isolated by previously published techniques (23Croze E.M. Morre D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1984; 119: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Hamilton R.L. Moorehouse A. Havel E.J. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 529-543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had the characteristics shown in Table I. The fraction was enriched in the Golgi marker with an 8-fold increase in its specific activity and a 30% recovery. The specific activities for the ER, lysosome, and plasma membrane markers were essentially unchanged. Significantly, only 5.3% of the lysosomal marker activity was recovered in this fraction.Table ISpecific activity of marker enzymes in total cell homogenate and intermediate density nonlysosomal fractions prepared from macrophagesGolgiERLysosomePMProteinHomogenate Specific activity5.0 ± 0.81.5 ± 0.20.5 ± 0.17.3 ± 1.1Intermediate density fraction Specific activity42.2 ± 2.60.9 ± 0.10.7 ± 0.17.0 ± 0.9 Recovery (%)30.1 ± 5.72.7 ± 0.15.3 ± 1.08.7 ± 1.24.6 ± 0.8J774 macrophages were plated and grown as described in the legend to Fig. 2.

This intermediate density fraction degraded almost two-thirds of newly synthesized total cellular protein, suggesting the presence of a major cellular degradative pathway. Major cellular pathways for degrading proteins are believed to primarily involve lysosomes or proteasomes (27Jentsch S. Schienker S.

Several conclusions were drawn based on these measurements and the crystal structures of a 92-kDa fragment of the yeast enzyme and a 43-kDa fragment ofEscherichia coli gyrase B-subunit. First, the footprinting results support the model previously inferred from the 92-kDa fragment crystal structure that the main site of DNA binding is comprised of a pair of semicircular grooves. Second, the binding of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog to the yeast enzyme appears to affect citraconylation at a minimum of six lysines in the ATPase domain of each polypeptide. Two of these lysines are probably involved in contacting the nucleotide directly, and one probably becomes buried when the two ATPase domains of a dimeric enzyme come into contact upon ATP binding; for the others, changes in lysine reactivity appear to reflect allosteric changes following ATP binding. Third, from a comparison of the footprint of the intact enzyme and those of the truncated polypeptides comprised of either the NH2- or the COOH-terminal half of the intact polypeptide, it appears that there are few contacts between the NH2- and COOH-terminal half of yeast DNA topoisomerase II."

Hybridization of poly(A)+ RNA with specific cDNA probes for enzyme types I–IX indicated 1) the presence of transcripts encoding types II–VI and type IX in rat and human, and type VII in rat and 2) the absence of detectable mRNA for types I and VIII in both species. No substantial change was observed in the amount of specific mRNA and basal AC activity from mid-pregnancy to term. However, activation of the α2-adrenergic receptor/Gi protein pathway resulted in potentiation of Gs-stimulated AC activity at mid-pregnancy but not at term (Mhaouty, S., Cohen-Tannoudji, J., Bouet-Alard, R., Limon-Boulez, I., Maltier, J. P., and Legrand, C. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 11012–11016). We demonstrate in the present work that βγ scavengers transducin-α and QEHA peptide abolished this positive input. On the other hand, increasing submicromolar concentrations of free Ca2+, a situation that mimics late term, reduced the forskolin-stimulated AC activity with an IC50 of 3.9 μm. Thus, the presence in myometrium of AC II family (types II, IV, VII) confers ability to G inhibitory proteins to stimulate enzyme activity via βγ complexes at mid-pregnancy, whereas expression of AC III, V, and VI isoforms confers to the myometrial AC system a high sensitivity to inhibition by Ca2+-dependent processes at term. These data suggest that in the pregnant myometrium, the expression of different species of AC with distinct regulatory properties provides a mechanism for integrating positively or negatively the responses to various hormonal inputs existing either during pregnancy or in late term.

Because one of the major sites of control of the biochemical events leading to uterine relaxation during normal pregnancy lies at the AC/cAMP system, the identification of AC isoforms in the pregnant myometrium is essential in understanding the influence exerted by the regulatory external signals (neurotransmitters and hormones) acting via G protein-coupled receptors. Hormonal control of AC activity is brought about by receptor-catalyzed activation of heterotrimeric G proteins that in turn regulate the cyclases by the release of α or βγ subunits or kinase activation. Recent studies have revealed an unexpected diversity of G protein-regulated AC by identifying nine distinct AC cDNA from various mammalian tissues (1Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 12190-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, AC III can be phosphorylated by a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in response to the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ which results, in vivo, in a 50% inhibition of hormone-stimulated enzyme (15Wei J. Wayman G. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24231-24235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The novel ninth AC is quite distinct from all of the other known AC subfamilies, and it is not affected by G βγ proteins or Ca2+ (5Premont R.T. Matsuoka I. Mattei M.-G. Pouille Y. Defer N. Hanoune J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13900-13907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, in vivo, when a cell type or tissue expresses various isoforms of AC one may expect that different physiological situations trigger different responses to the same external stimuli depending not only on the type of the receptor and G protein involved but also on the type of adenylyl cyclase to which they are coupled.As an initial approach to this issue in human and rat myometrium, we first characterized the type(s) of AC involved in myometrial signaling in both species during pregnancy. Then, because AC types II and IV are present in human and rat myometria, we examined the possibility that the positive input to the myometrial AC system emanating from the activated α2-adrenergic receptor (AR) coupled to Gi2/Gi3 proteins as described previously (16Mhaouty S. Cohen-Tannoudji J. Bouet-Alard R. Limon-Boulez I. Maltier J.-P. Legrand C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11012-11016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) involves Giβγ. This was performed by using transducin-α (17Weiland T. Ronzani M. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20791-20797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a synthetic peptide corresponding to the binding site of βγ in the AC II (18Chen J. Devivo M. Dingus J. Harry A. Li J. Sui J. Carty D.J. Blank J.L. Exton J.H. Stoffel R.H. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. Logothetis D.E. Hildebrandt J.D. Iyengar R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26445-26448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) which tie up the Giβγ released by α2-AR activation. Finally, because AC types V and VI are also strongly expressed in pregnant myometria, we investigated whether submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ attenuate forskolin-stimulated AC activity. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ is precisely the situation that occurs in response to external stimuli in the pregnant myometrium at the time of delivery. Data reported here provide an explanation for the switch in the stimulatory versusinhibitory input to myometrial AC reported at mid-pregnancy or term.DISCUSSIONThis study reports for the first time that pregnant human and rat myometria express transcripts encoding distinct populations of AC. Indeed, using Northern blot analysis, we detected AC II–VI and IX in both human and rat myometria, whereas type VII was present only in rat. The absence of detectable levels of types I and VIII mRNA is consistent with previous findings showing that these two enzymes are brain-specific. Although it is generally considered that all the structures that expressed more than one AC type contain several cell types, it is important to note that in the myometrium, smooth muscle cells present a great abundance and are distributed evenly throughout the longitudinal and circular layers. Only few other cell types (vascular or conjunctive) are observed. AC mRNA detected in this study using in situ hybridization derived mainly from myometrial cells as exemplified in Fig.6, A and B, illustrating the specific expression of AC type II in smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, in agreement with previous results (29Furuyama T. Inagaki S. Takagi H. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 19: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Mons N. Yoshimura M. Cooper D.M.F. Synapse. 1993; 14: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), control slides of rat brain hybridized in the same conditions indicated a strong expression of AC II in pyramidal cells and dentate gyrus of hippocampus (Fig. 6 C). All of these observations suggested to us that Gβγ-activated (types II and IV and presumably VII) and Ca2+-inhibitable (types III, V, and VI) AC expressed in human and rat myometrium might contribute to physiological processes sensitive to Gi proteins and Ca2+-dependent regulation of the cAMP generation in this tissue.To estimate the total levels of AC in myometria from mid-pregnant and delivering rats, we measured the maximal levels of high affinity [3H]forskolin binding sites (B max). In the presence of Gpp(NH)p, our results demonstrated an increase of the [3H]forskolin binding sites at mid-pregnancy but not at term. Because it was proposed that the guanine nucleotide-stimulated high affinity binding of [3H]forskolin represents binding to the Gs-activated form of AC, one may suggest that the Gs/catalytic unit complexes are reduced at term. Potential differences in the affinity of this ligand (K d ) observed in mid-pregnant rat myometrium could mean either differences in the interaction of [3H]forskolin with some isoforms of AC present in the myometrium or differential expression of isoforms according to the stage of pregnancy. Although our results show that the expression of AC transcripts in rat myometrium over the second half of pregnancy remains stable, we cannot exclude possible changes at the protein levels. At the present time, this issue cannot be settled because no specific antibody that allows to quantify directly each AC type is available. Interestingly, the decrease of [3H]forskolin binding sites number reported at term in the presence of Gpp(NH)p correlates well with the decline of forskolin-stimulated AC activity. Furthermore, the reduced ability of guanine nucleotides or cholera toxin (acting at the Gs level) to stimulate myometrial AC activity at term and the fact that Mn2+/GDPβS (acting solely at the catalytic unit of the AC, 34Strittmatter S. Neer E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 6344-6348Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) has no different regulatory effects, points to a defect in the availability or functionality of regulatory Gs proteins rather than a reduction in the catalytic subunits of AC. This conclusion supports previous data of our laboratory establishing that amounts of cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylated Gsα subunits diminished by 3-fold at delivery versus pregnancy (35Elwardy-Mérézak J. Maltier J.P. Cohen-Tannoudji J. Lécrivain J.L. Vivat V. Legrand C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 13: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, as shown by radioligand binding experiments, the reduced response to isoproterenol at term is not caused by changes in total β-AR number (28Vivat V. Cohen-Tannoudji J. Revelli J.P. Muzzin P. Giacobino J.P. Maltier J.P. Legrand C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7975-7978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is the consequence of Gs protein uncoupling (24Cohen-Tannoudji J. Vivat V. Heilmann J. Legrand C. Maltier J.P. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 6: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Previously, we have shown that catecholamines acting through α2-AR/Gi2–3 proteins signaling pathway potentiate β-AR-stimulated AC activity in rat myometrium at mid-pregnancy (16Mhaouty S.

These data suggested a tight interplay between the two adrenergic pathways in the regulation of AC types II and IV through βγ complexes according to the findings of Tang and Gilman (6Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), Gao and Gilman (7Gao B. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10178-10182Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and Federman et al. (36Federman A.D. Conklin B.R. Schrader K.A. Reed R.R. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Here, the demonstration that the positive input emanating from the activated α2-AR involves βγ complexes of Giproteins expressed in rat myometrium (37Cohen-Tannoudji J. Mhaouty S. Elwardy-Mérézak J. Lécrivain J.L. Robin M.T. Legrand C. Maltier J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was achieved using transducin-α and QEHA peptide: both factors abolished the potentiation of AC activity induced by the α2-AR agonist clonidine. In the same work (16Mhaouty S. Cohen-Tannoudji J. Bouet-Alard R. Limon-Boulez I. Maltier J.-P. Legrand C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11012-11016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we reported a switch in the stimulatory versus inhibitory input to AC population from the α2-AR/Gi protein-signaling pathway at late term. The idea that changes in AC isoform expression might underlie such a versatility of the α2-AR signal is highly speculative inasmuch as it is not possible to demonstrate that some AC types (specially types II and IV) are the most prevalent isoforms in the mid-pregnant myometrium compared with late term myometrium. At this latter period, no substantial modification in the amounts of specific types of AC transcripts as well as no alteration in the basal activity of the AC system have been observed. So, in the parturient rat myometrium, when the balance among Gi3, Gi2, and Gs proteins was changed (35Elwardy-Mérézak J. Maltier J.P. Cohen-Tannoudji J. Lécrivain J.L. Vivat V. Legrand C. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 13: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Cohen-Tannoudji J. Mhaouty S. Elwardy-Mérézak J. Lécrivain J.L. Robin M.T. Legrand C. Maltier J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) we suggest the possibility that distinct patterns of responsiveness of the myometrial AC population may account for the switch between the two types of input (positive and negative) initiated by α2-AR activation. Interestingly, a decline of immunodetected β subunits of G proteins which is expected to reflect the status of the βγ complexes (38Tanfin Z. Goureau O. Milligan G. Harbon S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) paralleled the 1.7-fold decrease of Gi3α subunit in the late pregnant rat myometrium (37Cohen-Tannoudji J. Mhaouty S. Elwardy-Mérézak J. Lécrivain J.L. Robin M.T. Legrand C. Maltier J.P. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 38Tanfin Z. Goureau O. Milligan G. Harbon S. FEBS Lett. 1991; 278: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It is then conceivable to propose that the reduced availability of Giβγ complexes together with the reduced levels of functional Gsα protein may underlie the loss of AC potentiation observed at term in response to β2-/α2-AR activation. On the other hand, the role of Gi protein-coupled α2-AR in mediating AC inhibition in the late pregnant myometrium has been well documented in rat (16Mhaouty S. Cohen-Tannoudji J. Bouet-Alard R. Limon-Boulez I. Maltier J.-P. Legrand C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11012-11016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and human (39Breuiller M. Rouot B. Litime M.H. Leroy J. Ferré F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1990; 70: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To date, the inhibitory regulation of AC type II through Gi proteins still remains controversial since the data reported by Chen and Iyengar in COS7 cells transfectants (40Chen J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12253-12256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the recent work of Lanier's laboratory in collaboration with us on DDT1-MF2 cells AC II transfectants (11Marjamaki A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 16466-16473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) are not in agreement with other findings in Sf9 cell membranes (4Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, AC types III, V, and VI expressed in rat and human myometrium are highly sensitive to inhibition by Giproteins (4Taussig R. Tang W.J. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6093-6100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Chen J. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12253-12256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could then present possible targets to α2-AR/Gi protein-mediated inhibition at term. The presence of AC types V and VI is also consistent with the observation that physiological relevant concentrations of Ca2+ inhibit basal and stimulated AC population in pregnant myometrial membranes of rat (our present work) and human (41Doualla-Bell Koto Maka F. Breuiller M. Leroy M.J. Josserand S. Ferré F. Gynecol. Obstet. Invest. 1990; 30: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This is in line with preliminary evidences showing that these enzymes are regulated directly by submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+(2Yoshimura M. Cooper D.M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1993; 293: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As demonstrated for cardiac adenylyl cyclases (42Colvin R.A. Oibo J.A. Allen R.A. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the inability of maximally stimulating concentrations of Mg2+to overcome Ca2+ inhibition (data not shown) indicates that Ca2+ concentrations in the μm range are not competitive with Mg2+ (i.e. high affinity effect) by contrast with millimolar concentrations of Ca2+(43Lasker R.D. Downs R.W. Aurbach G.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 216: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Half-maximal inhibition value reported in this work is also in agreement with values found for cardiac muscle (42Colvin R.A. Oibo J.A. Allen R.A. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 44Espinasse I. Iourgenko V. Defer N. Samson F. Hanoune J. Mercadier J.J. J. Mol. Cell.

Biophys. 1995; 241: 28-35Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) AC system. Interestingly, these Ca2+concentrations at which AC inhibition is reported are in the range of those required to activate myosin light chain phosphorylation (46Taylor D.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14456-14462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and correspond also to Ca2+ concentrations measured in myometrial membranes from rats close to term treated with the uterotonic agent oxytocin (47Magocsi M. Penniston J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1063: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+ can affect also indirectly AC activity because inhibition of AC type III activity through its phosphorylation by calmodulin-casein kinase II is mediated by intracellular increase of Ca2+ (15Wei J. Wayman G. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24231-24235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In conditions prevailing in vivo in the pregnant myometrium at term when intramyometrial submicromolar concentrations of Ca2+ rise, such regulation may also provide a mechanism for attenuation of hormone-stimulated cAMP generation. Alternatively, Lanier's group together with our laboratory (11Marjamaki A. Sato M. Bouet-Alard R. Yang Q. Limon-Boulez I. Legrand C. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16466-16473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have established that the stimulatory/inhibitory input to the AC types II and IV initiated through α2-AR activation is modified differentially by protein kinase C-mediated effects. In particular, activation of protein kinase C in AC IV-transfected DDT1-MF2 cells eliminates the stimulatory input due to α2-AR activation. All of these observations indicate that the rise of intracellular Ca2+occurring at term in response to external stimuli (oxytocin, prostaglandin F2α, endothelins, acetylcholine through M3-muscarinic receptors, norepinephrine through α1-AR or α2B-AR) would reduce the synthesis of the smooth muscle relaxation mediator, i.e. cAMP, thereby allowing myometrial cells to contract.In conclusion, analysis of the functional properties of the AC population identified in the myometrium demonstrates for the first time that βγ complexes and Ca2+ are two main regulators of the AC/cAMP cascade during pregnancy in the rat. Because of similarities between human and rat myometrium with regard to AC types, as well as G proteins and membrane receptors, we postulate similar physiological regulations of the AC/cAMP system in human. Thus, cross-talks between various hormonal signals that are routed differentially through Gs, Gi, or Gq proteins according to the stage of pregnancy may dictate the final response of the AC/cAMP system and consequently the contractile state of the uterus. Data on hormonal regulation of myometrial contractility during the course of pregnancy implicate adenylyl cyclase (AC) 1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclases; AR, α2-adrenergic receptor; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; kb, kilobases; GDPβS, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclases; AR, α2-adrenergic receptor; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; kb, kilobases; GDPβS, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate. stimulatory pathways as a key component that may affect the degree of intracellular cAMP generation and consequently the contractile state of the uterus. Because one of the major sites of control of the biochemical events leading to uterine relaxation during normal pregnancy lies at the AC/cAMP system, the identification of AC isoforms in the pregnant myometrium is essential in understanding the influence exerted by the regulatory external signals (neurotransmitters and hormones) acting via G protein-coupled receptors. Hormonal control of AC activity is brought about by receptor-catalyzed activation of heterotrimeric G proteins that in turn regulate the cyclases by the release of α or βγ subunits or kinase activation. Recent studies have revealed an unexpected diversity of G protein-regulated AC by identifying nine distinct AC cDNA from various mammalian tissues (1Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.J.

All of these isoforms of AC differ in their tissue distribution and their regulatory properties, providing a mode for different cells to respond diversely to similar external stimuli. Among all of the AC identified so far, the highly similar types II, IV, and VII form the largest known subfamily. Types II and IV share the property of being highly stimulated by βγ subunits of Gi/Goinhibitory proteins in the presence of activated Gsα (6Tang W.J. Gilman A.G.

On the other hand, AC III can be phosphorylated by a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in response to the elevation of intracellular Ca2+ which results, in vivo, in a 50% inhibition of hormone-stimulated enzyme (15Wei J. Wayman G. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24231-24235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The novel ninth AC is quite distinct from all of the other known AC subfamilies, and it is not affected by G βγ proteins or Ca2+ (5Premont R.T. Matsuoka I. Mattei M.-G. Pouille Y. Defer N. Hanoune J.

Thus, in vivo, when a cell type or tissue expresses various isoforms of AC one may expect that different physiological situations trigger different responses to the same external stimuli depending not only on the type of the receptor and G protein involved but also on the type of adenylyl cyclase to which they are coupled."

Removal of the 20-amino acid pro sequence (Fig. 1) is necessary to observe ςK-dependent transcription activity in vivo as well as in vitro (9Kroos L. Kunkel B. Losick R.

In an analysis of the effects of the amino terminus of various ς factors on DNA binding in the absence of the core subunits, pro-ςK was found to bind to DNA with 10-fold lower affinity than ςK in vitro (13Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To understand better the role of the pro sequence in controlling ςK activity in DNA binding and transcription initiation, we have created several NH2-terminally truncated pro-ςK derivatives. In this report, we describe the behavior of these ςKderivatives in DNA binding and holoenzyme containing the ςK derivatives in transcription initiation, both at the ςK-dependent gerE promoterin vitro. We show that the pro sequence affects transcriptional activity of holoenzyme by interfering with core association by pro-ςK and by influencing DNA interactions, including initial binding and promoter DNA melting. Surprisingly, we discovered that a 6-amino acid deletion of the pro sequence is sufficient to activate pro-ςK completely, to an even greater extent than removal of the entire pro sequence, primarily through altered interactions of holoenzyme with the DNA. Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from New England Biolabs. Calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase was from Boehringer Mannheim, andTaq DNA polymerase was from Fisher Scientific. Thrombin (T6759) was from Sigma. NTPs were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]CTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham. Purified Escherichia coli core RNA polymerase was from Epicentre Technologies (Madison, WI). Nitrocellulose filters were from Millipore. Buffer and gel components were from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by BioServe Biotechnologies (Laurel, MD) or Life Technologies, Inc. Primer sequences are available upon request. All ςK derivatives were constructed by placing portions of the sigK gene downstream of the gene encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST) 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. in pGEX-2T (14Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides that incorporated EcoRI andBamHI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively, were used to amplify fragments of the sigK gene from pSK5 (gift of L. Kroos) using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fragments containing full-length sigK (pro-ςK) and three successive NH2-terminal deletions of sigK, removing 6 (pro-ςKΔ6), 10 (pro-ςKΔ10), and 20 (ςK) amino acids, were generated. PCR methods were described previously (13Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Amplified DNA was inserted in-frame into the pGEX-2T plasmid using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. All plasmid constructs were transformed into E. coliBL21 (Novagen, Inc.) for overproduction of the GST fusion proteins. GST- ς fusions were induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm to a liter of cells growing exponentially at 37 °C in LB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were harvested after 3 h of induction by centrifugation and the resulting pellet stored at −20 °C. Purification of GST-ς fusions was performed as described by Dombroski et al. (15Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record Jr., M.T. Siegle D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) except that the GST tag was removed as follows. The fusion proteins, while bound to glutathione agarose beads, were incubated with thrombin at 0.4–1.2 units/0.5 ml of beads for 2 h at 25 °C. This removes the GST tag by cleaving at a thrombin site between GST and ς factor. Two additional amino acids, Gly and Ser, remained on the NH2 terminus of all ςK derivatives. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing only ς factor was isolated and dialyzed against 16 mmNa2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, and 20% glycerol. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. DNA carrying the ςK-dependent gerE promoter was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and used as the substrate for filter binding assays. Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the flanking regions of the gerE promoter were used to amplify a 224-base pair DNA fragment from pSC146 (gift of L. Kroos) which spanned 96 base pairs upstream and 131 base pairs downstream of the +1 start site. Primer labeling and PCR conditions were described previously (15Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record Jr., M.T. Siegle D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), except the annealing step was at 45 °C. DNA binding assays with the ςK derivatives, in the absence of the core subunits, were performed as described previously (13Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record Jr., M.T. Siegle D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) except buffer conditions were modified such that binding buffer contained either 3.5 or 14 mm potassium acetate in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Holoenzyme was reconstituted by mixing the purified core with a 6–20-fold molar excess of each ς factor. gerE DNA template was synthesized using PCR as above without the 5′-end labeling. The mixtures were incubated on ice for 15 min. Optimal transcriptional activity of each ς factor was determined using increasing ratios of ς factor to core. Runoff transcription assays were performed by first incubating reconstituted holoenzyme (1 pmol) with PCR-amplified gerEDNA template (0.1 pmol) in transcription buffer (100 or 250 mm KCl, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) at 37 °C for 10 min. This allowed the polymerase to bind the promoter and form an open complex. Transcription was started upon the addition of 1.2 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and NTPs (final concentrations, 2 mm ATP, CTP, UTP and 0.2 mm GTP). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and terminated by adding 5 μl of 0.04% formamide stop solution (0.04% bromphenol blue, 0.04% xylene cyanol, in formamide). RNA products were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels, and the bands were quantified on a Packard InstantImager. Abortive transcriptions were performed similarly to the runoff transcription assay except that the dinucleotide GpA (2 mm), CTP (0.2 mm), and [α-32P]CTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) were added to initiate the reactions instead of all four NTPs. This limited transcription to a three-nucleotide transcript (GpApC). Labeled DNA for DNase I cleavage assays was prepared by first digesting pSC146 plasmid with HindIII andKpnI to generate a 312-base pair fragment carrying thegerE promoter. Digested samples were incubated with calf alkaline phosphatase (according to manufacturer's instructions) at 37 °C for 2 h. The phosphatase and restriction enzymes were removed using Micropure-EZ enzyme remover (Amicon). The fragment was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mol) by adding T4 polynucleotide kinase (30 units) and incubating the DNA at 37 °C for 45 min. Samples were then digested with BamHI to remove the 3′-end label, producing a 281-base pair 5′-32P-labeledgerE promoter DNA fragment. This fragment was isolated from 2% agarose gels and purified with the Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). 5′-End-labeled gerE DNA for KMnO4experiments was synthesized using the PCR amplification ofgerE from pSC146 plasmid as described for nitrocellulose filter binding assays. Holoenzyme-DNA complexes were analyzed using DNase I footprinting as follows. Holoenzyme (1 pmol) was reconstituted as described above and incubated with 32P-gerE promoter DNA (0.1 pmol) for 30 min at 37 °C in 45 μl of DNase I buffer (20 mmHepes (pH 7.5); 10 mm MgCl2; 0.1 mmEDTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; and 0.2 mm GTP, ATP, and CTP) plus either 60, 100, 150, or 200 mm KCl. Samples were then treated with 0.4–0.7 unit of RQ1 DNase I (Promega) for 30 s at 37 °C. DNase I activity was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of phenol equilibrated with Tris-HCl (pH 8). The aqueous phase was precipitated with 0.3m sodium acetate and ethanol. Samples were resuspended in 3 μl of loading dye (8 m urea, 0.5 × TBE, 0.04% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.04% (w/v) xylene cyanol), heated to 100 °C for 2 min, and loaded on to an 8% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. KMnO4 modification footprinting was performed as described previously (16Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 17Newlands J.T. Ross W. Gosink K.K. Gourse R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) except reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in KMnO4 buffer with either 100 or 250 mm KCl. Radioactive bands were quantified using a Packard InstantImager. KMnO4 footprinting was used to assess the ability of the various ςK derivatives to bind to core RNA polymerase (16Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). KMnO4 reactions were performed as above except that 32P-gerE DNA was present at a 1.5-fold molar excess over RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Core RNA polymerase (1.0 pmol) was incubated with either pro-ςKΔ6 (6 pmol), equimolar pro-ςK and pro-ςKΔ6 (6 pmol each), or equimolar ςKand pro-ςKΔ6 (6 pmol each). Cleavage products were quantified using a Packard InstantImager. The stability of RNA polymerase-DNA initiated open complexes was examined using the nucleotide binding assay described previously (16Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Roe J. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). ςK holoenzyme was formed as described above.32P-gerE promoter DNA in binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) was added to holoenzyme and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Mixtures were filtered through nitrocellulose filters (Millipore) then washed with 0.5 ml of wash buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1m or 0.8 m NaCl. The DNA retained was determined using liquid scintillation counting and Ultima Gold Mixture (Packard). Previous work revealed that pro-ςK, in the absence of the core subunits of RNA polymerase, binds the ςK-dependent promoter,gerE, with 10-fold lower affinity than ςK(13Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Here we generated two successive deletions from the amino terminus of the pro sequence to determine more precisely the effect of the pro sequence on DNA binding by ςK. Deletions of the first 6 (pro-ςKΔ6) and 10 (pro-ςKΔ10) amino acids of pro-ςK (Fig. 1 B) were constructed as GST fusion proteins and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In this work, unlike in previous studies, we removed the GST affinity tag to eliminate any influence that GST might have on ςK activity. All four ςK derivatives were tested for DNA binding ability using nitrocellulose filter retention assays (Fig.2) (13Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record Jr., M.T. Siegle D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Pro-ςK bound to the gerE promoter in a manner similar to that observed in previous work (13Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Pro-ςKΔ6 and pro-ςKΔ10 displayed higher affinity for pgerE than pro-ςK by approximately 100-fold and 10-fold, respectively (Fig. 2). This suggests that the first 6 amino acids of the pro sequence are important for modulating DNA binding. Surprisingly, we observed that ςK retained only 20% of the input gerE promoter DNA even at the lowest salt concentrations used (3.5 mm sodium acetate). The discrepancy between this observation and data obtained previously using GST-ςK (13Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2446-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) may be attributed to the removal of the GST tag in the current experiments. We do not understand how the GST tag might have improved filter retention for ςK in the past, but it is most likely due to increased nonspecific interaction between the protein and the nitrocellulose filter rather than any change in the interactions between the protein and the DNA. As shown below, ςK is capable of effectively directing promoter binding and transcription initiation by holoenzyme. Transcription from ςK-dependent promoters by ςKholoenzyme (EςK) requires the removal of the pro sequence, since it has been shown that pro-ςK is unable to direct transcription (10Lu S. Halberg R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9722-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Lu S. Kroos L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3936-3943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because pro-ςKalone can interact with promoter DNA as shown and because deleting as few as 6 amino acids of the pro sequence increases binding affinity, we hypothesized that Epro-ςKΔ6 andEpro-ςKΔ10 may be active in transcription from the ςK-dependent promotergerE. Holoenzymes containing each of the ςK derivatives were reconstituted in vitro using E. coli core RNA polymerase and were tested for their ability to synthesize runoff transcripts. The core subunits are very highly conserved, and others have used such heterologous holoenzymes successfully to examine transcription properties in vitro (19Chen Y.-F. Helmann J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5123-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Aiyar S.E. Juang Y.-L. Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11501-11506Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Shorenstein R.G. Losick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6170-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of a 131-nucleotide transcript from the ςK-dependent gerE promoter on a linear DNA fragment, was monitored. Initially, we analyzed runoff transcription for all four EςK derivatives at low salt (100 mm KCl). We found that pro-ςKΔ6 was active in directing transcription by holoenzyme and that the level of transcription was similar toEςK (data not shown). The same analysis was performed at high salt (250 mm KCl), where Epro-ςK synthesized an undetectable level of runoff transcript (Fig.3 A). This is consistent with the lack of significant activity reported for this enzyme in the past (10Lu S. Halberg R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9722-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that Epro-ςKΔ6 activity was optimal at high salt concentrations, resulting in an approximately 34-fold higher level of product than that observed forEςK under the same conditions (Fig.3 A). Epro-ςKΔ10 was also active, generating transcripts at a level similar toEςK. Transcription initiation has been described as a multistep process. Initially, ς factor associates with the core subunits of RNA polymerase to form holoenzyme (R) and then directs holoenzyme binding to the promoter (P) to form a closed complex (RPc). DNA promoter melting near the −10 recognition site, presumably by isomerization of holoenzyme, forms the open complex (RPo). Polymerase then incorporates nucleotide triphosphates to form an initiated complex (RPinit), which is capable of abortive RNA synthesis, followed by promoter escape and elongation of the transcript (22Record Jr., M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington D. C.1996: 792-820Google Scholar). During initiation, RNA polymerase can remain at the promoter and generate small (2–10 nucleotides) abortive transcripts. An abortive transcription assay has been developed which exploits this ability and allows assessment of events that precede promoter clearance (23McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 24Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 493-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We used this assay to determine if the differences observed for the ςK derivatives at 250 mm KCl in the runoff assay occurred before or after promoter clearance. The conditions were identical to the runoff assays except that a dinucleotide (GpA) primer and [α-32P]CTP were used, rather than all four NTPs, to limit transcription to a three-nucleotide product (GpApC). All of the holoenzymes were capable of synthesizing abortive transcripts even at 250 mm KCl (Fig. 3 B). The fact thatEpro-ςK andEpro-ςKΔ10 generated abortive transcripts more efficiently than runoff transcripts (compare Fig. 3 Awith Fig. 3 B) implies a defect in promoter clearance under the conditions used. The ability of holoenzyme to bind to DNA, and the boundaries of the complexes on the DNA, can be assessed using DNase I footprinting (25Schmitz A. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 111-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Cowing D.W. Mecsas J. Record Jr., M.T. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We used this technique to analyze theEςK derivatives for interactions with thegerE promoter. All four EςK derivatives were able to produce specific protein-promoter DNA complexes (Fig.4 A). Protection of thegerE promoter extended from +20 to −60 relative to the +1 start site. The length of the footprint suggested that these complexes were similar to either the extended closed (RPc) or the open (RPo) complexes, characterized forEς70 (22Record Jr., M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington D. C.1996: 792-820Google Scholar).Epro-ςKΔ6 showed a stronger affinity for the DNA than either Epro-ςK orEςK, at 100 mm KCl, given the overall better protection of the gerE promoter. Also,Epro-ςKΔ6 created hypersensitive bands between the −10 and −35 promoter recognition sites (−21 and −22), which were not visible in the Epro-ςK andEςK footprint, indicating that pro-ςKΔ6 may be distorting the DNA in that region.Epro-ςKΔ10 protected the gerEpromoter similarly to Epro-ςKΔ6, but with a reduction in the intensity of the hypersensitive sites. Many Eς70-DNA open (RPo) complexes are stable to challenge by heparin, a polyanionic competitor, whereas closed (RPc) complexes are not (18Roe J. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 27Melacon P. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4318-4331Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Mita B.C. Tang Y. deHaseth P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30428-30433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Zhang X. Reeder T. Schleif R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 14-24Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We used heparin as a tool to assess the stability ofEςK-gerE complexes in DNase I footprinting. All four EςK derivatives formed complexes that were sensitive to even a low level of heparin (25 μg/ml), indicating an unstable open complex (RPo) or complexes that are closed (RPc) rather than open (RPo) (data not shown). Because these experiments were conducted in the presence of initiating nucleotides (GTP, ATP, CTP), the presumed formation of initiated complexes (RPinit) does not appear to improve the stability to heparin challenge, as has been observed for the E. coli rrnBP1 promoter (17Newlands J.T. Ross W. Gosink K.K. Gourse R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We also examined the binding of the EςKderivatives to pgerE DNA at four concentrations of salt because of the dramatic increase in transcription observed forEpro-ςKΔ6 at 250 mm KCl. The DNase I protection assay was used but with varied concentrations of KCl (60, 100, 150, and 200 mm). Data are shown only forEpro-ςKΔ6 (Fig. 4 B). The extent of protection for all of the holoenzymes was generally from about −60 to +20. Three of the holoenzymes, Epro-ςK,Epro-ςKΔ10, andEςK, showed decreased DNA protection as the salt concentration was increased. Epro-ςKappeared to retain some binding at the highest salt (250 mmKCl) since the −35 region was better protected compared withEςK under the same conditions. Interestingly,Epro-ςKΔ6 bound to pgerE very well at high salt concentrations in agreement with its high transcriptional activity under these conditions. The hypersensitive band at −22 decreased in intensity as salt concentration increased, implying that the structure of the protein-DNA complex may be changing as a function of salt concentration. We observed that theEpro-ςKΔ6 footprint, at 150 and 200 mm KCl, extended slightly beyond +20 and shorter than −60 compared with 60 and 100 mm KCl, making the footprint appear to “shift” slightly forward. This shift in the footprint, from greater protection in the upstream region at low salt, to greater protection of the downstream region at high salt, may help explain the improved performance of Epro-ςKΔ6 in transcription under high salt conditions. To distinguish whether the DNase I footprints represented closed or open complexes, we subjected the complexes to KMnO4 treatment, which modifies pyrimidines (particularly thymines) on single-stranded DNA. Modified positions render the DNA susceptible to cleavage by piperidine. KMnO4 can thus be used to determine the extent of open complex (RPo) formation (17Newlands J.T. Ross W. Gosink K.K. Gourse R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect any DNA cleavage due to KMnO4sensitivity for Epro-ςK-pgerEcomplexes at either salt concentration (100 mm or 250 mm), suggesting that the Epro-ςKcomplexes observed in DNase I footprinting at low salt are primarily extended closed complexes (Fig. 5). ForEςK, Epro-ςKΔ6, andEpro-ςKΔ10, we observed that approximately equal amounts of DNA were susceptible (50%) at low salt, indicating that these three proteins form RPo equivalently (Fig.5 A). Three bands were resolved in these experiments, corresponding to thymines −9, −6, and −4 of the gerEpromoter. A band appearing at cytosine −1 was visible but at much lower levels. As the salt concentration was increased,EςK open complexes decreased (8% cleaved) (Fig. 5 B) in agreement with the loss of DNase I protection as a function of salt concentration.Epro-ςKΔ6 andEpro-ςKΔ10 maintained formation of RPo at high salt because cleavage under high salt conditions was similar to that observed at low salt (60 and 40%). We found that for both Epro-ςKΔ6 andEpro-ςKΔ10, another cleavage site appeared at cytosine −21. This band corresponds to the hypersensitive site found in the DNase I footprint experiments and indicates that base pairing in this region has been disturbed. Previous work has shown that formation of the open complex byEς70 on the λPR promoter in the presence of a subset of initiating nucleotides, was stable to a 0.8m NaCl wash (16Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Roe J. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 495-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This stabilization is caused by the formation of RPinit, which has incorporated a few nucleotides but has not left the promoter and is thus more resistant to 0.8 m NaCl than RPo. This 0.8 mNaCl challenge assay can be used to determine the relative extents of RPo and RPinit formation. TheEςK derivatives were incubated with32P-labeled gerE promoter with and without NTPs (GTP, ATP, and CTP). The mixtures were filtered through nitrocellulose, and the filters were washed with a buffer containing either 0.1 or 0.8m NaCl. All four EςK-DNA complexes were resistant to a 0.1 m NaCl wash both with and without the addition of NTPs (Table I). As expected, all of the complexes were destabilized when the filters were washed with 0.8m NaCl. In the presence of NTPs, all fourEςK-DNA complexes became more resistant to the 0.8 m NaCl wash, indicating that they are forming RPinit complexes (Table I) although with varying efficiency. Because RPo is in rapid equilibrium with RPinit, a retention of approximately 50% of the input DNA is expected for those polymerases forming RPinitefficiently. The resistance to 0.8 m NaCl was weakest forEpro-ςK-DNA complexes and stronge"

To determine if the equivalent residue in the related thiol ester-containing protein human α2-macroglobulin (α2M), asparagine 1065, plays a similar role, we have expressed and characterized four α2M variants in which this asparagine has been replaced by aspartate, alanine, histidine, or lysine. The change from asparagine resulted in an altered ability to form the thiol ester. This ranged from failure to form the thiol ester (Asn → Asp) to a maximum extent of formation of about 50% (Asn → Ala). For the three variants that were able to form the thiol ester, the rates of thiol ester cleavage by a given amine were found to be different from one another and slower in nearly all cases than plasma α2M, but with the same relative reactivity of methylamine > ethylamine > ammonia. The rate of conformational change that follows cleavage of thiol esters in a functional half-molecule was also found to differ between the variants and to be slower than plasma α2M. TNS emission spectra indicated that the conformations of the transformed variants differed measurably from transformed plasma α2M. These findings suggest that residue 1065 plays a critical role in human α2M, for formation of the thiol ester, for its subsequent reaction with nucleophiles, and for the conformational change induced by this reaction. By analogy with C4, where this residue influences the nucleophile preference through direct interaction with the thiol ester, residue 1065 in α2M is expected to be located in or very close to the thiol ester region in α2M. It has been shown that the relative reaction preference of the C4 thiol ester toward oxygen and nitrogen nucleophiles upon activation by proteinase depends on whether residue 1106 is aspartate or histidine (Dodds, A. W., Ren, X.-D., Willis, A. C., and Law, S. K. A. (1996) Nature 379, 177–179).

The abundant human plasma protein α2-macroglobulin (α2M) 1The abbreviations used are: α2M, α2-macroglobulin; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); TNS, 6-(p-toluidino)-2-naphthalene-sulfonic acid; TNB, 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate. shares a number of properties with the two complement proteins C3 and C4. All three proteins arose from a common ancestral gene (1Sottrup-Jensen L. Stepanik T.M. Kristensen T. Lønblad P.B. Jones C.M. Wierzbicki D.M. Magnusson S. Domdey P.B. Wetsel R.A. Lundwall Å. Tack B.F. Fey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and contain a reactive internal thiol ester that becomes even more reactive toward nucleophiles following limited proteolytic cleavage of the protein. In the case of the monomeric proteins C3 and C4, the proteolytic cleavage occurs as part of complement activation. The consequent activation of the thiol ester results in a fraction (∼10%) of the activated C3 or C4 forming covalent cross-links to nucleophiles in the vicinity. C3 shows a preference for oxygen nucleophiles (2Law S.K.A. Minich T.M. Levine R.P. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3267-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas C4 shows a preference for nitrogen nucleophiles, but with an increase in reactivity toward oxygen for the B isotype (3Isenman D.E. Young J.R. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 3019-3027PubMed Google Scholar, 4Law S.K.A. Dodds A.W. Porter R.R. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1819-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the case of human α2M, activation of the thiol ester toward nucleophiles and its subsequent cleavage results in a major conformational change of the protein that traps, and thereby inhibits, the proteinase that caused the activation (5Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Given the key role that the thiol ester plays in the functioning of both the two complement proteins and of α2M, it is important to understand both how the thiol ester is formed and what determines its reactivity toward nucleophiles. For α1inhibitor 3, a rodent protein of the α-macroglobulin family, it has been shown that thiol ester formation is very dependent on the conformation of the protein and only occurs after folding and subsequent conformational rearrangement that involves a disulfide isomerization (6Wassler M. Esnard F. Fries E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24598-24603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Similarly, time-dependent conformation-specific reformation of the thiol ester from the amine-cleaved residues that initially formed it has been demonstrated for C3, C4, and α2M (7Grøn H. Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 8Pangburn M.K. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although without an elucidation of the specific structural requirements for the reformation. More definitive information on the molecular basis for the nucleophile preference of the thiol ester in C4 has been provided by an examination of the effect of single site mutations at position 1106 of C4. Although this is a position 115 residues C-terminal from the cysteine that is involved in forming the thiol ester, it is one of only four residues, occurring in a hexapeptide, that differ between the C4A and C4B isotypes of C4. Law and co-workers (10Sepp A. Dodds A.W. Anderson M.J. Campbell R.D. Willis A.C. Law S.K.A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that histidine at this position (C4B) resulted in enhanced reactivity toward oxygen, whereas aspartate (C4A) resulted in overwhelming preference for reaction with nitrogen nucleophiles. The molecular basis for this was elegantly demonstrated to be the formation of an acyl-histidine intermediate in C4B upon activation, that had enhanced reactivity toward oxygen nucleophiles (11Dodds A.W. Ren X.D. Willis A.C. Law S.K.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The equivalent residue in human α2M is asparagine 1065, which occurs in the hexapeptide SGSLLN. Comparison of all available sequences of α-macroglobulins (13 total) showed that asparagine occurs in 11 and histidine in 2 (TableI). Because of this high conservation of asparagine and the presence of histidine as the only alternative, as in C4B, we sought to determine whether this residue also influenced the properties of the thiol ester in human α2M. Four variants of human α2M, in which residue 1065 was changed from asparagine to alanine, aspartate, histidine, or lysine, were therefore expressed in a baby hamster kidney cell expression system (12Gettins P.G.W. Hahn K. Crews B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14160-14167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and their properties were determined. We report here the characterization of these variants and demonstrate that this residue was critical for normal formation and functioning of the thiol ester.Table IMacroglobulin primary structures of hexapeptide corresponding to thiol ester control region of C4ProteinSequence1-aThe residue corresponding to 1106 of human C4 and 1065 of human α2M is underlined.SourceC4A (human)PCPVLDRef. 26Belt K.T.

Single site mutagenesis was carried out directly on the intact plasmid using the polymerase chain reaction-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Complementatry pairs of oligonucleotides were used. The sequences for the antisense oligonucleotides were 5′-CTT TAT GGC ATT XXXGAG CAG TGA CCC-3′, where XXX was GGC for the mutation to alanine, GTC for the mutation to aspartate, GTG for the mutation to histidine, and CTT for the mutation to lysine. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing of a stretch of at least 40 nucleotides centered on the codon for residue 1065. Baby hamster kidney cells were transfected with plasmids containing cDNA for α2M, dihydrofolate reductase (pSVdhfr), and Escherichia coliamino glycoside 3′-phosphotransferase (pRMH140). Methotrexate and neomycin were used to select for stable transfectants, as described (12Gettins P.G.W. Hahn K. Crews B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14160-14167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were grown to confluence in roller bottles and cycled between serum-containing and serum-free medium. α2M was isolated from serum-free cycles of medium. Levels of secreted α2M were in the range of 3–13 mg/liter for stable transfectants. α2M was purified by metal-chelate chromatography, as described previously (14Gettins P.G.W. Boel E. Crews B.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically from the absorbance at 280 nm, using the same extinction coefficient of 640,000m−1 cm−1 for plasma α2M (15Hall P.K. Roberts R.C. Biochem. J. 1978; 17: 27-38Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the four recombinant variants. Polyacrylamide gels were run under nondenaturing conditions in 5% acrylamide slabs according to the procedure of Davis (16Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15961) Google Scholar) or under denaturing conditions in 7.5% gels according to the procedure of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Determination of both the number and kinetics of cleavage of thiol esters present in the variants was carried out by reaction of the free cysteine derived from the thiol ester with DTNB and spectrophotometric measurement of the TNB− released. TNB− was quantitiated from the absorbance at 410 nm using an extinction coefficient of 13,500 m−1cm−1 (18Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). For all measurements, a concentration of DTNB of 100 μm was used. The reaction of DTNB with free SH groups under these conditions is essentially instantaneous, so that the rate of this reaction does not influence the measured rate of thiol ester appearance (19Larsson L.-J. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2802-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The concentration of free SH groups initially present in samples of plasma, recombinant wild type, and variant α2Ms was determined from the immediate change in absorbance at 410 nm upon the addition of α2M to the sample cuvette and of an equivalent volume of buffer to the reference cuvette. Both cuvettes contained DTNB at the same concentration and had been zeroed relative to one another prior to the addition of α2M. For determination of intact thiol esters, sample and reference cuvettes were set up containing both DTNB and α2M (0.5 μm final concentration) and zeroed relative to one another. In this way, free SH already present reacted immediately with DTNB to release TNB− to give an absorbance change that was then zeroed and was thus eliminated from further measurements. Cleavage of thiol esters was then initiated by the addition of amine hydrochloride stock solution (5 m, pH 8.0) to both reference and sample cuvettes to give the desired final concentration. Quantitation of thiol esters was then based only on the time-dependent change in absorbance due to the reaction of DTNB with newly formed SH groups. The whole time course was fitted to a monoexponential function to obtain the best fit for the total change in absorbance. All measurements were made in a dual beam Shimadzu 2100PC spectrophotometer. Data were fitted by nonlinear least squares analysis using the program Scientist (MicroMath, Salt Lake City, UT). The pseudo-first order rate constant was converted to a second order rate constant (k 1) by dividing by the free base concentration of the amine at that pH. The rate constant for the conformational change step (k c) was determined directly by following the change in TNS fluorescence after prior rapid cleavage of the thiol esters. α2M was prereacted for a short time (20–60 s) with 2.5 m amine hydrochloride, pH 9.0. The high pH and high amine concentration ensured that all thiol esters had been cleaved within the time of reaction, as calculated from the rate constants for thiol ester cleavage determined by the DTNB assay. This was confirmed by the invariance of the fitted rate constant obtained for experiments with longer preincubation time. The reaction mixture was diluted into 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 9.0 containing 150 mm NaCl and 50 μm TNS. The rate of conformational change was determined from the change in intensity of the TNS fluorescence emission spectrum, monitored at 410 nm, with excitation at 316 nm. Measurements were made on an SLM8000 spectrofluorimeter in thermostatted acrylic cuvettes. Slits of 4 nm (excitation) and 16 nm (emission) were used. Data were fitted by nonlinear least squares analysis to a monoexponential using Scientist (MicroMath). TNS emission spectra were recorded on an SLM8000 spectrofluorimeter, with excitation at 316 nm and emission monitored in 2-nm steps from 360 to 600 nm. Excitation and emission slits were both set to 4 nm. An integration time of 10 s/point was used. Samples were 1.2 ml in 3-ml thermostatted acrylic cuvettes. An immediate demonstration that residue 1065 influences thiol ester function in human α2M was the presence of higher electrophoretic mobility species (fast form) for the variants on a polyacrylamide gel run under nondenaturing conditions (Fig.1 B, odd numbered lanes), indicative of some species without thiol esters (20Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Sayers C.A. Biochem. J. 1979; 181: 401-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The N1065D variant was an extreme case with 100% fast form, indicating no thiol esters. The other three variants showed mixtures of slow, intermediate, and fast electrophoretic forms, with the fast form component ranging from ∼53% for the N1065K variant through ∼42% for the N1065H variant to a low of ∼33% for the N1065A variant, as estimated from scanning of the Coomassie-stained gel and integration. The effect of reaction of each of these samples with methylamine confirmed that the slow and intermediate forms represented a species containing intact thiol esters (full or partial complement, respectively) and the fast form a species lacking intact thiol esters (Fig. 1 B, even numbered lanes). Thus, any slow or intermediate form was converted to the fast form through cleavage of the thiol ester by methylamine, whereas the fast form species was unaffected, since there were no thiol esters to be cleaved. The heterogeneity of the variant species was shown not to be due to the conditions used for production of the BHK-derived recombinant α2Ms (Fig. 1 A). Thus, both recombinant wild-type α2M and a “revertant” wild type, in which we had converted the cDNA of the N1065K variant back to wild-type α2M and expressed the resulting wild-type α2M, showed a single slow form species with the same mobility as plasma α2M (Fig. 1 A, odd numbered lanes). These two recombinant wild-type α2Ms were also completely transformed to the fast form by reaction with methylamine (Fig. 1 A, even numbered lanes). A more quantitative estimate of the stoichiometry of thiol esters was obtained from DTNB assay of each of the variants upon complete reaction with methylamine, measuring the appearance of new thiol groups, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The quantitation of thiol esters was based upon the change in absorbance during the reaction and therefore did not include any free cysteine already present in the variants. Based on this assay, the N1065D variant contained no thiol esters, whereas the N1065A, N1065H, and N1065K variants contained 1.9, 1.6, and 1.7 thiol esters, respectively, based on at least five separate determinations and with an uncertainty of no more that ± 0.2 thiol esters. Recombinant wild-type α2M showed the presence of 3.5 ± 0.3 thiol esters. The complete absence of thiol esters in the N1065D variant and the approximately 50–60% less than maximal thiol ester content of the other three variants could be due to several causes. One is that the thiol esters were originally present but were rapidly hydrolyzed. The second is that the thiol esters did not form or formed to a smaller extent than in wild-type α2M. In either case, this should have resulted in the presence of free SH groups in the variant α2Ms, as isolated. This was confirmed by the DTNB assay, which showed that N1065D had 1.9 mol of free SH/tetramer, N1065H had 1.7 mol/tetramer, N1065A had 1.1 mol/tetramer, and N1065K had 0.7 mol/tetramer. Recombinant wild-type α2M showed the presence of only 0.3 free SH groups. One way in which the thiol esters might have been cleaved is through exposure of the α2M to proteinase, with consequent bait region cleavage and thiol ester activation to nucleophilic attack. If this were the case, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis should show the presence of a large fraction of α2M chains cleaved in the bait region. The overwhelming appearance of only intact chains indicated that this was not the case for any of the variants or for control plasma α2M (Fig. 2,odd numbered lanes), indicating that proteinase activation was not the cause of low thiol ester content. The possibility of a greatly enhanced reactivity toward water, such as in C4B, as the cause of loss of thiol esters was tested for the three variants that contain some thiol esters (N1065A, N1065H, and N1065K) by incubating samples under conditions of buffer, temperature, and pH identical to those of the BHK cells during expression of the variants. Aliquots were withdrawn after 24, 48, and 72 h and run under nondenaturing conditions to determine if there had been any reduction in slow form species as an indicator of further loss of thiol ester through hydrolysis. No such reduction was seen for any of the three variants even for the longest time point (data not shown), indicating that any increased reactivity toward water must be so small as to be unable to account for the reduction in thiol ester content seen in the variants. It is therefore most likely that any fast or intermediate form species contain subunits in which the thiol ester never formed. We examined, in that fraction of each of the variants that formed thiol esters, the ability of proteinase to cleave the bait region and induce the conformational change that results in a change in electrophoretic mobility from slow to fast. All of the slow mobility components were rapidly converted to fast mobility by reaction with trypsin (data not shown, but gel was almost identical to Fig. 1), through the normal cleavage of the bait region (Fig. 2, even numbered lanes) that activates the thiol ester and results in its rapid cleavage. It should be noted that even in methylamine-produced fast form α2M, the bait region remains somewhat accessible to proteinase (14Gettins P.G.W. Boel E. Crews B.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This explains the presence of a fraction of cleavage for the N1065D variant. One of the characteristic properties of α2M, C3, and C4 is that, when heated, each undergoes autolysis of the peptide backbone at the glutamate that forms the thiol ester. This is thought to result from attack of the peptide nitrogen on the carbonyl of the thiol ester followed by hydrolysis. Such autolysis therefore requires an intact thiol ester and the appropriate positioning of the thiol ester group and the intervening peptide backbone. To determine if the three thiol ester-containing variants behaved normally in this regard, samples were heated to 95 °C for 35 min, and the products were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For all three variants, the characteristic heat fragmentation bands of ∼120 and 60 kDa were observed in about the same amounts relative to uncleaved subunits as was seen for plasma α2M (data not shown), suggesting that residue 1065 is not involved in this process. The N1065D variant showed no heat fragmentation. TNS, noncovalently bound to α2M, is a sensitive monitor of conformational change induced by methylamine treatment or reaction with proteinase (21Strickland D.K. Bhattacharya P. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3115-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Björk I. Lindblom T. Lindahl P.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2797-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). α2M has a single class of relatively weak binding sites for TNS (K d = 100–200 μm) (23Strickland D.K. Larsson L.-J. Neuenschwander D.E. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2797-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that changes both affinity and environment upon change of conformation (21Strickland D.K. Bhattacharya P. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3115-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Strickland D.K. Larsson L.-J. Neuenschwander D.E. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2797-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For human plasma α2M, this results in a large fluorescence enhancement and a blue shift from 450 to 410 nm upon reaction with either methylamine or proteinase. We therefore used TNS fluorescence to compare the conformations of the four variants. Since the N1065D variant was entirely in fast form, with residue 1065 as a glutamine, and the other three variants were mixtures of slow, intermediate, and fast, we first converted N1065A, N1065H, and N1065K completely into the fast form by reaction with ammonia (for consistency, the N1065D was also treated with ammonia, although no thiol esters were initially present and thus no further reaction was possible). The TNS emission spectra of fast forms of N1065A, N1065H, and N1065K were almost identical (Fig. 3 B), differing only slightly in wavelength maximum, which was centered at about 430 nm. The spectrum for N1065D, however, showed a much lower intensity, although with similar wavelength maximum. In contrast, the spectrum for ammonia-treated plasma α2M showed a very different position for the wavelength maximum and a lower fluorescence intensity. Because of the major differences between plasma α2M and the variants and the less dramatic, but reproducible, differences between the variants, we also compared the spectra of amine-cleaved plasma α2M for cleavage by ammonia and methylamine, since this would result in different chemical groups becoming part of the environment of the thiol ester site. This comparison showed that even the small differences in these groups have significant effects on the TNS spectra (Fig. 3 A), with both the intensity and wavelength maximum changing for cleavage by ammonia or methylamine. This suggests that the TNS binding site either is very close to the thiol ester site or is exquisitely sensitive to even minor conformational differences in α2M. The second order rate constants for cleavage of the thiol esters in the three variants that contain some thiol esters were determined by DTNB assay carried out under pseudo-first order conditions for ammonia, methylamine, and ethylamine and compared with the rate constants for plasma α2M determined under identical conditions (TableII). Reactivity toward Tris was also examined, since the low pK a of 8.08 at 25 °C (24Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. Oxford University Press, Oxford1986: 424Google Scholar) enabled high concentrations of the free base form to be achieved at relatively low total amine concentration. Reactivity with Tris was so low as to be unmeasurable, even using a final Tris concentration of 0.5m. Each of the three variants showed the same rank order of reactivity as is found for plasma α2M, namely methylamine > ethylamine > ammonia, with approximately the same relative values for the rate constants, suggesting that accessibility to the thiol ester in each variant is very similar to that in plasma α2M. The mutations at position 1065 did, however, have an adverse effect in nearly all cases on the actual rate constants (Table II). Only histidine was able to confer similar reactivity to plasma α2M for two of the amines studied, ammonia and ethylamine, although the rate of reaction with methylamine was slower with this variant than with plasma α2M. The magnitude of the rate reduction did not correlate with the size of the replacement residue, as might result if accessibility were being affected, since it was greatest for the smallest replacement, alanine.Table IIRate constants for thiol ester cleavage and α 2 M conformational changeα2Mk 1(M −1s−1)2-aSecond order rate constant for cleavage reaction of α2Ms by different amines."
