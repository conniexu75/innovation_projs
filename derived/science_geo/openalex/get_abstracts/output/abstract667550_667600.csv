https://openalex.org/W3125753820,"Despite the established dogma of central nervous system (CNS) immune privilege, neuroimmune interactions play an active role in diverse neurological disorders. However, the precise mechanisms underlying CNS immune surveillance remain elusive; particularly, the anatomical sites where peripheral adaptive immunity can sample CNS-derived antigens and the cellular and molecular mediators orchestrating this surveillance. Here, we demonstrate that CNS-derived antigens in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulate around the dural sinuses, are captured by local antigen-presenting cells, and are presented to patrolling T cells. This surveillance is enabled by endothelial and mural cells forming the sinus stromal niche. T cell recognition of CSF-derived antigens at this site promoted tissue resident phenotypes and effector functions within the dural meninges. These findings highlight the critical role of dural sinuses as a neuroimmune interface, where brain antigens are surveyed under steady-state conditions, and shed light on age-related dysfunction and neuroinflammatory attack in animal models of multiple sclerosis."

We adapt expansion microscopy, which physically expands biological specimens, for long-read untargeted and targeted in situ RNA sequencing. We applied untargeted expansion sequencing (ExSeq) to the mouse brain, which yielded the readout of thousands of genes, including splice variants. Targeted ExSeq yielded nanoscale-resolution maps of RNAs throughout dendrites and spines in the neurons of the mouse hippocampus, revealing patterns across multiple cell types, layer-specific cell types across the mouse visual cortex, and the organization and position-dependent states of tumor and immune cells in a human metastatic breast cancer biopsy. Thus, ExSeq enables highly multiplexed mapping of RNAs from nanoscale to system scale."

Under reaction conditions, not only can metal nanoparticles change shape but their interaction with the oxide support could also be affected. Yuan et al. used aberration-corrected environmental transmission electron microscopy to study gold nanoparticles on titanium surfaces at low electron beam doses. During carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation at total pressures of a few millibars and 500°C, they observed that gold nanoparticles rotated by about 10° but returned to their original position when CO was removed. Density function theory calculations indicated that rotation was induced by changes in the coverage of adsorbed molecular oxygen at the interface. Science , this issue p. 517"

However, analogs that shuttle two heavy atoms back and forth are much harder to catalyze. Dong et al. report an electrochemical approach that transfers a pair of adjacent chlorines or bromines from an alkyl compound to an olefin. The method could help to remediate halogenated pollutants while concurrently producing fine chemicals. Science , this issue p. 507"
https://openalex.org/W3124861177,"Nucleation in atomic crystallization remains poorly understood, despite advances in classical nucleation theory. The nucleation process has been described to involve a nonclassical mechanism that includes a spontaneous transition from disordered to crystalline states, but a detailed understanding of dynamics requires further investigation. In situ electron microscopy of heterogeneous nucleation of individual gold nanocrystals with millisecond temporal resolution shows that the early stage of atomic crystallization proceeds through dynamic structural fluctuations between disordered and crystalline states, rather than through a single irreversible transition. Our experimental and theoretical analyses support the idea that structural fluctuations originate from size-dependent thermodynamic stability of the two states in atomic clusters. These findings, based on dynamics in a real atomic system, reshape and improve our understanding of nucleation mechanisms in atomic crystallization."

Wang and Toumi report that cyclones' points of maximum intensity also have been coming closer to land since 1982, the distance decreasing by about 30 kilometers per decade as their paths drift poleward and westward (see the Perspective by Camargo and Wing). This shift could increase the danger that tropical cyclones pose to coastal populations. Science , this issue p. 514 ; see also p. 458"
https://openalex.org/W3124041513,"Pump it up Carbon nanotube yarns can be used as electrochemical actuators because infiltration with ions causes a contraction in length and an expansion in diameter. Either positive or negative ions can cause this effect. Chu et al. constructed an all-solid-state muscle that eliminated the need for an electrolyte bath, which may expand the potential for its use in applications. By infiltrating the yarns with charged polymers, the fibers start partially swollen, so the length can increase through the loss of ions. It is thus possible to increase the overall stroke of the muscle. Further, these composite materials show a surprising increase in stroke with scan rate. Science , this issue p. 494"
https://openalex.org/W3112115390,"Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are innate sensors of viruses and can augment early immune responses and contribute to protection. We hypothesized that MAIT cells may have inherent adjuvant activity in vaccine platforms that use replication-incompetent adenovirus vectors. In mice and humans, ChAdOx1 (chimpanzee adenovirus Ox1) immunization robustly activated MAIT cells. Activation required plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-derived interferon (IFN)-α and monocyte-derived interleukin-18. IFN-α-induced, monocyte-derived tumor necrosis factor was also identified as a key secondary signal. All three cytokines were required in vitro and in vivo. Activation of MAIT cells positively correlated with vaccine-induced T cell responses in human volunteers and MAIT cell-deficient mice displayed impaired CD8+ T cell responses to multiple vaccine-encoded antigens. Thus, MAIT cells contribute to the immunogenicity of adenovirus vectors, with implications for vaccine design."

Little is known about how individuals within these colonies navigate the many interactions that must occur in such a complex cooperative group. Barker et al. show that calls emitted by individuals, in particular the common “chirp” call, convey information specific to the animal's group (see the Perspective by Buffenstein). Group differences are cultural, rather than genetic, and are related to the queen: Cross-fostered pups adopt their rearing colony's dialects, and dialects change with queen replacement.

Technical advances in extending spectroscopy to the attosecond time scale has caused considerable interest in experimental studies of various ultrafast processes that were previously inaccessible. Using attosecond transient absorption around the carbon K-edge accompanied by ab initio quantum dynamics simulations, Zinchenko et al. investigated ultrafast, non-adiabatic dynamics in the ethylene cation. They directly observed the electronic D 1 → D 0 relaxation mediated by the conical intersection taking place within 7 femtoseconds, far shorter than any vibrational period or any previously reported electronic relaxation. The demonstrated technique is directly applicable to liquids and solutions, enabling further studies of charge- and energy-transfer dynamics of organic molecules in chemical and biochemical systems.

Collectively, the presented data highlight the value of comparative 3D genome analyses in dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of brain development and evolution. The human brain exhibits unique organizing principles and developmental patterns when compared with nonhuman primates (NHPs) (Sousa et al., 2017Sousa A.M.M. Meyer K.A. Santpere G. Gulden F.O. Sestan N. Evolution of the Human Nervous System Function, Structure, and Development.Cell. 2017; 170: 226-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the developing human brain has an expanded proliferative zone, the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ), and more diverse neural progenitor cell types that account for human brain size expansion (Lui et al., 2011Lui J.H.

In addition, the maturation of neurons appears to be prolonged, and neural networks are more complex in hominids compared to NHPs (Marchetto et al., 2019Marchetto M.C. Hrvoj-Mihic B. Kerman B.E.

For example, our recent study showed that the transgenic monkeys carrying a human version of MCPH1 (a key brain developmental gene) had delayed neuron differentiation and maturation and improved short-term memory, mimicking the brain developmental neoteny of humans (Shi et al., 2019Shi L.

Additionally, the subplate neurons form one of the first functional cortical circuits during fetal brain development and may associate with the unique developmental patterns of human neural circuits (Hoerder-Suabedissen and Molnár, 2015Hoerder-Suabedissen A.

Recent advances in comparative genomic analyses have provided increasing evidences that our evolution, since the human-chimpanzee divergence, has been driven mostly by gene regulation (Bird et al., 2007Bird C.P.

Several studies revealed that long-range chromatin interactions might regulate human-specific brain gene expression and associate with aging-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (Chen et al., 2018Chen H.

Commun. 2019; 10: 2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Hence, it is feasible to hypothesize that the human-specific changes of chromatin structure may lead to gene regulation alterations and eventually contribute to the unique human brain phenotypes. To test this hypothesis, we need to generate brain 3D genome data of NHPs at key developmental stages in order to identify the human-specific gene regulatory changes. In theory, as the closest relative of human, chimpanzee would be the ideal NHP species to study (Waterson et al., 2005Waterson R.H. Lander E.S. Wilson R.K. Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis ConsortiumInitial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome.Nature. 2005; 437: 69-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). However, it is extremely difficult to obtain chimpanzee fetal brain samples for 3D genome experiments. Alternatively, as the most widely used NHP species, macaque is phylogenetically close to human (∼7% sequence divergence), and it is relatively easy to obtain brain samples at different developmental stages, making it a suitable model for exploring human brain evolution at 3D genome level. Here, we collected brain tissues of Chinese rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) at mid-gestation, and constructed a high-resolution 3D genome map, which provides valuable basis for further comparative 3D genomic analysis. Through multi-omics evolutionary analyses among human, rhesus macaque, and mouse, we identified many human-specific chromatin structure changes including topologically associating domains (TADs) and loops. We also studied the genomic features and functional enrichment of the human-specific TADs and loops to shed new light on the genetic basis of human brain development and evolution. We sampled three macaque fetal brains at mid-gestation (E84), the time of neurogenesis peak during development. We dissected cerebral cortex into two major zones: (1) cortex plate (CP), consisting primarily of post-mitotic neurons, and (2) germinal zone (GZ), consisting primarily of neural progenitors (Figure 1A; STAR methods). To reveal the regulatory landscape of the developing macaque cortex, we constructed high-resolution genome-wide chromatin interaction maps using Hi-C. We also mapped gene expression (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]), DNase I hypersensitive sites (DNase-seq), and CTCF occupancy (CTCF chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq]). We validated the accuracy of zone dissection by checking the expression of the known marker genes for neural progenitors (SOX2, PAX6, and FOXG1) and neurons (FEZF2, SYP, and NEUROD1) (Figure 1B). Using Hi-C 2.0 (Belaghzal et al., 2017Belaghzal H. Dekker J. Gibcus J.H. Hi-C 2.0: An optimized Hi-C procedure for high-resolution genome-wide mapping of chromosome conformation.Methods. 2017; 123: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we sequenced ∼8 billion paired-end reads and generated nearly 5 billion unique mapped contacts in total (Table S1). The biological and technical replicates are highly correlated (Pearson’s correlation R ≥ 0.95) (Figures S1A and S1B), and we therefore merged the data by zone type for downstream analysis. We validated contact quality of the Hi-C data by cis/trans interaction ratio and distance-dependent interaction frequency decay (Figure S1C; Table S1). We reached an ultra-deep resolution of 1.5 kilobase pairs (kb) (Table S1; STAR methods), which enables us to explore macaque 3D genome structure at different scales, including compartments, TADs, and loops (Figure 1C). Most of the A/B compartments are conserved between CP and GZ, and the ratio (3.6%–3.8%) of switched compartments is consistent with previous findings in human fetal brains (CP versus GZ: 3.78%) (Won et al., 2016Won H. de la Torre-Ubieta L. Stein J.L. Parikshak N.N. Huang J. Opland C.K. Gandal M.J. Sutton G.J. Hormozdiari F. Lu D. et al.Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain.Nature. 2016; 538: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) (Figure S1D). We identified a total of 1,977 and 2,265 TADs for CP and GZ, respectively, among which 64.4% are shared between them (Figure S1E), and the numbers of the identified TADs in macaque is similar to the reported numbers of TADs in the human fetal brain (Won et al., 2016Won H. de la Torre-Ubieta L. Stein J.L. Parikshak N.N. Huang J. Opland C.K. Gandal M.J. Sutton G.J. Hormozdiari F. Lu D. et al.Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain.Nature. 2016; 538: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Because the resolution of the published human fetal brain Hi-C data was only 10 kb (Won et al., 2016Won H. de la Torre-Ubieta L. Stein J.L. Parikshak N.N. Huang J. Opland C.K. Gandal M.J. Sutton G.J. Hormozdiari F. Lu D. et al.Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain.Nature. 2016; 538: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), for cross-species comparison, we called loops in macaque with the same resolution using the HICCUPS pipeline (Rao et al., 2014Rao S.S. Huntley M.H. Durand N.C. Stamenova E.K. Bochkov I.D. Robinson J.T. Sanborn A.L. Machol I. Omer A.D. Lander E.S. Aiden E.L. A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping.Cell. 2014; 159: 1665-1680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar) (STAR methods). In total, we identified 8,399 and 15,048 loops in CP and GZ, respectively (Figure S1F). The 3C experiments show that 86.6% (26/30) of the loops can be validated, suggesting our Hi-C results are reliable (Figure S1G; Table S2). There are 8,179 (54.4%) loops shared between CP and GZ (Figure S1F), and the smaller number of loops (∼44% reduction) in CP relative to GZ is consistent with the reported reduction (∼40% to 50% decrease) of loops in human neurons relative to neural progenitor cells (Rajarajan et al., 2018Rajarajan P. Borrman T. Liao W. Schrode N. Flaherty E. Casiño C. Powell S. Yashaswini C. LaMarca E.A. Kassim B. et al.Neuron-specific signatures in the chromosomal connectome associated with schizophrenia risk.Science. 2018; 362: eaat4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As expected, the zone-specific loops are associated with differential gene expression (Figure S1H). For example, we observed zone-specific chromatin interactions at SOX2 (highly expressed in GZ) and BHLHE22 (highly expressed in CP), respectively (Figures 1D and S1I). To show that the identified loops using our ultra-deep contact maps are informative in detecting regulatory events in the genome, as a proof of principle, we checked interactions between two putative enhancers and the promoter of FOXP2 (Figure 1E), a well-known gene that plays an important role in human speech and language development (Lai et al., 2000Lai C.S. Fisher S.E. Hurst J.A. Levy E.R. Hodgson S. Fox M. Jeremiah S. Povey S. Jamison D.C.

Peiffer D.A. Gunderson K.L. Patel A. Peters S. Cheung S.W. Bacino C.A. Deletion of 7q31.1 supports involvement of FOXP2 in language impairment: clinical report and review.Am. J. Med. Genet. A. 2007; 143A: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These two putative enhancers are also active in humans (hs218 and hs956) and can drive forebrain- and midbrain-specific expression in mouse embryos (Visel et al., 2007Visel A. Minovitsky S. Dubchak I. Pennacchio L.A. VISTA Enhancer Browser--a database of tissue-specific human enhancers.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D88-D92Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) (Figure S1J). The loops between these two enhancers and the promoter of FOXP2 were successfully identified by the Hi-C data (Figure 1E). To assess the penetrance of the detected loops around FOXP2, we performed 3D-DNA FISH using the brain tissue sections of fetal monkeys (STAR methods), and the results are consistent with the Hi-C data that the loop regulating FOXP2 are present in both CP (69.0%, 49/71) and GZ (76.7%, 66/86) at similar frequency (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.284) (Figures 1F, 1G, S1K, and S1L; Table S2). We saw similar penetrance ratios for another GZ-CP shared loop involving the SOX2 gene (63.0%, 53/84 in CP and 57.1%, 48/84 in GZ) (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.528) (Figures S1M and S1N). In contrast, although a GZ-biased loop from Hi-C has overall lower penetrance ratio compared to the GZ-CP shared loops, it has a higher penetrance ratio in GZ (11.4%, 9/79) than in CP (3.7%, 3/81) (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.077) (Figures S1M, S1O, and S1P). These cases indicate that our Hi-C data can effectively capture regulatory events during corticogenesis. We next performed cross-species Hi-C analyses at multiple scales, which allows us to characterize human-specific patterns in 3D genome organization. TADs are fundamental regulatory chromatin structures and are largely conserved across tissues and species (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B. Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar; Rao et al., 2014Rao S.S. Huntley M.H.

However, how TAD changes during evolution influence gene regulation of brain development are not well defined. Here, we characterize the evolutionary dynamics of TADs by comparative brain Hi-C across human, macaque, and mouse (outgroup). The developmental stage (17–18 gestation weeks) of the published human Hi-C data (Won et al., 2016Won H. de la Torre-Ubieta L. Stein J.L. Parikshak N.N. Huang J. Opland C.K. Gandal M.J. Sutton G.J. Hormozdiari F. Lu D. et al.Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain.Nature. 2016; 538: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) is equivalent to that of rhesus macaque, and the mouse Hi-C data were from in vivo neural progenitors (corresponding to GZ) and neurons (corresponding to CP) (Bonev et al., 2017Bonev B. Mendelson Cohen N. Szabo Q. Fritsch L. Papadopoulos G.L. Lubling Y. Xu X. Lv X. Hugnot J.P. Tanay A. Cavalli G. Multiscale 3D Genome Rewiring during Mouse Neural Development.Cell. 2017; 171: 557-572.e24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). We identified TADs and TAD boundaries using the directionality index (DI) and the insulation score methods (Crane et al., 2015Crane E. Bian Q. McCord R.P. Lajoie B.R. Wheeler B.S. Ralston E.J.

Topological domains in mammalian genomes identified by analysis of chromatin interactions.Nature. 2012; 485: 376-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar) (Figure S2A; STAR methods). We compared the features of TADs among human, macaque, and mouse. The number and size of TADs among species are similar in both CP and GZ (Figure S2B). We define the shared TADs among the three species as the conserved TADs, and those only gained or lost in human as the human-specific TADs (hsTADs) (STAR methods). We found 499 hsTADs, including 410 human gained TADs (hgTADs) and 89 human lost TADs (hlTADs) (Figure S2C). The medium size of hgTADs is 640 kb, smaller than the conserved TADs (900 kb) (Figure S2C), consistent with the published data showing a large size of the conserved TADs by comparing human, gibbon, and other mammalian species (Lazar et al., 2018Lazar N.H. Nevonen K.A. O’Connell B. McCann C. O’Neill R.J. Green R.E. Meyer T.J. Okhovat M. Carbone L. Epigenetic maintenance of topological domains in the highly rearranged gibbon genome.Genome Res. 2018; 28: 983-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It was reported that the transcriptionally active domains in Drosophila tend to have smaller size than the inactive domains (Sexton et al., 2012Sexton T. Yaffe E. Kenigsberg E. Bantignies F. Leblanc B. Hoichman M. Parrinello H. Tanay A. Cavalli G. Three-dimensional folding and functional organization principles of the Drosophila genome.Cell. 2012; 148: 458-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Hence, hgTADs are likely active regulatory domains. By contrast, hlTADs occur less frequently than hgTADs in the human genome, likely due to a strong functional constraint on loosing previously functional TADs during evolution, and their size (1,320 kb) is larger than the conserved TADs (Figure S2C). We saw similar species-specific TAD size patterns in macaque and mouse (Figure S2C). We then compared the TAD boundaries among species (STAR methods). The results show that ∼55% (n = 1,513) of the TADs boundaries are conserved across species, and ∼14% (n = 385) of the TAD boundaries are the hgTAD boundaries (Figures 2A and 2B ; Table S3). We further explored the features of the conserved and the hgTAD boundaries. The conserved TAD boundaries have stronger insulation than the hgTAD boundaries (Figures 2C and S2D). Although most of the conserved and the hgTADs boundaries are enriched with CTCF binding, the enrichment levels are lower for the hgTAD boundaries (63%) than the conserved TAD boundaries (77%), indicating that the hgTAD boundaries are less CTCF dependent than the conserved TAD boundaries (Figure 2D). We also found the hgTAD boundaries showed weaker CTCF ChIP-seq signals than the conserved boundaries in neural cells (Song et al., 2019Song M. Yang X. Ren X. Maliskova L. Li B. Jones I.R. Wang C. Jacob F. Wu K. Traglia M. et al.Mapping cis-regulatory chromatin contacts in neural cells links neuropsychiatric disorder risk variants to target genes.Nat. Genet. 2019; 51: 1252-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Figure S2E). We finally examined the tissue and cell type conservation ratios (Schmitt et al., 2016Schmitt A.D. Hu M. Jung I. Xu Z. Qiu Y. Tan C.L. Li Y. Lin S. Lin Y. Barr C.L. Ren B. A Compendium of Chromatin Contact Maps Reveals Spatially Active Regions in the Human Genome.Cell Rep. 2016; 17: 2042-2059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and found that the conserved TAD boundaries had higher conservation ratio across tissues and cell types, while the hgTAD boundaries were more tissue and cell-type-specific (Figures 2E and S2F). Collectively, through cross-species comparison, we were able to identify human-specific TADs, especially the hgTADs, which showed distinct features in view of size, CTCF binding strength, and tissue/cell specificity, an implication functional specialization of these newly evolved TADs during human brain evolution. Previously, it was reported that the mammalian interspersed repeats (MIRs), a conserved family of transposable elements (TEs), can serve as insulators within TAD boundaries in a CTCF-independent manner (Wang et al., 2015Wang J. Vicente-García C. Seruggia D. Moltó E. Fernandez-Miñán A. Neto A. Lee E. Gómez-Skarmeta J.L. Montoliu L. Lunyak V.V. Jordan I.K. MIR retrotransposon sequences provide insulators to the human genome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E4428-E4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We performed an enrichment analysis for TEs in the human genome and compared the patterns between the hgTAD boundaries and the conserved TAD boundaries. We found the conserved TAD boundaries were enriched for evolutionarily old TEs, including MIR, LINE-2 (L2), Charlie, and MaLR (Figure S2G). By contrast, the hgTAD boundaries are enriched in evolutionarily young TEs, and four TE families are slightly enriched, including Alu, LINE-1 (L1), human endogenous retrovirus subfamily 1, and K (ERV1 and ERVK) (Figures 2F and S2G). In particular, compared to the conserved boundaries, the hgTAD boundaries are significantly enriched in AluY, the youngest Alu elements in primates (Kapitonov and Jurka, 1996Kapitonov V. Jurka J. The age of Alu subfamilies.J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), while no significant enrichment was detected in the relatively old Alu elements (AluJ and AluS) (Figure 2G), implying that the young Alu elements might be actively involved in forming the human-specific contact patterns (Cournac et al., 2016Cournac A. Koszul R. Mozziconacci J. The 3D folding of metazoan genomes correlates with the association of similar repetitive elements.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 245-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the L1 subfamilies, the evolutionarily young L1PA is significantly enriched for the hgTAD boundaries, but not the relatively old L1PB (Figure S2H). We then examined the genes associated with the conserved and the hgTAD boundaries (STAR methods). We found that genes associated with the hgTAD boundaries showed marginally significant expression difference across species compared with the conserved TAD boundaries (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.06) (Figure S2I). The conserved TAD boundaries were more enriched in housekeeping genes, while the hgTAD boundaries were more enriched in brain-development-related genes (Figures S2J and S2K; Table S3). One example is the hgTAD boundary around CNTN5, a gene involved in neuron circuit formation and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (Ashrafi et al., 2014Ashrafi S. Betley J.N. Comer J.D.

This hgTAD boundary contains Alu Y elements and is correlated with an increased CNTN5 expression in human than in macaque (Figure 2H). Collectively, we observed a significant enrichment of TEs, especially the evolutionarily young TEs (AluY and L1PA) at the hgTADs boundaries, which may contribute to the origin of the human-specific TADs in brain during evolution. Compared to TADs, chromatin loops are more dynamic across developmental stages and may affect gene expression (Bonev et al., 2017Bonev B. Mendelson Cohen N. Szabo Q. Fritsch L. Papadopoulos G.L. Lubling Y. Xu X. Lv X. Hugnot J.P. Tanay A. Cavalli G.

We identified loops in the three species at 10 kb resolution using the HICCUPS pipeline (Rao et al., 2014Rao S.S. Huntley M.H. Durand N.C. Stamenova E.K. Bochkov I.D. Robinson J.T. Sanborn A.L.

Aggregating peak analysis (APA) demonstrated the accuracy of loop calling (Figure S3B). This was further supported by the epigenetic features of loops (Figure S3C). Next, we compared loops across species using the merged CP and GZ loop profiles so that the species-specific rather than the zone-specific changes can be detected. In total, we identified 1,904 conserved loops (ConsLs) among the three species and 1,266 human-specific loops (HSLs) (Figures 3A and 3B ; Table S4), and these loops were validated by APA (Figures 3A and S3D). In general, the lengths of HSLs and the macaque-specific loops are significantly smaller than that of ConsLs (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p < 2.2 × 10−16), while the pattern is"

https://openalex.org/W3123687227,"Systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis is a fatal protein misfolding disease in which excessive secretion, misfolding, and subsequent aggregation of free antibody light chains eventually lead to deposition of amyloid plaques in various organs. Patient-specific mutations in the antibody VL domain are closely linked to the disease, but the molecular mechanisms by which certain mutations induce misfolding and amyloid aggregation of antibody domains are still poorly understood. Here, we compare a patient VL domain with its nonamyloidogenic germline counterpart and show that, out of the five mutations present, two of them strongly destabilize the protein and induce amyloid fibril formation. Surprisingly, the decisive, disease-causing mutations are located in the highly variable complementarity determining regions (CDRs) but exhibit a strong impact on the dynamics of conserved core regions of the patient VL domain. This effect seems to be based on a deviation from the canonical CDR structures of CDR2 and CDR3 induced by the substitutions. The amyloid-driving mutations are not necessarily involved in propagating fibril formation by providing specific side chain interactions within the fibril structure. Rather, they destabilize the VL domain in a specific way, increasing the dynamics of framework regions, which can then change their conformation to form the fibril core.

These findings reveal unexpected influences of CDR-framework interactions on antibody architecture, stability, and amyloid propensity. Amyloidoses comprise a family of protein misfolding diseases in which disease-specific precursor proteins aggregate into highly ordered amyloid fibrils (1Knowles T.P.J. Vendruscolo M. Dobson C.M. The amyloid state and its association with protein misfolding diseases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar). These fibrils form amyloid plaques, which are deposited either systemically or in an organ-specific manner causing severe damage (2Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, amyloid formation, and human disease: A summary of progress over the last decade.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86: 27-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). The most common systemic disease in this context is amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis, in which an antibody light chain (LC) acts as the precursor protein that eventually forms amyloid fibers (3Gertz M.A. Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis: 2018 Update on diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.Am.

Program. 2017; 2017: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In healthy individuals, plasma cells secrete IgG antibodies, which consist of two LCs and two heavy chains covalently linked by disulfide bridges. Each of the LCs is made up of an N-terminal variable (VL) domain and a C-terminal constant (CL) domain (5Murphy K. Weaver C. Janeway's Immunobiology. W.W. Norton & Company, New York, NY2016Crossref Google Scholar). In AL amyloidosis, malignant monoclonal plasma cells overproduce and secrete LCs into the blood stream leading to very high concentrations of circulating LCs (6Weiss B.M. Hebreo J. Cordaro D.V. Roschewski M.J. Baker T.P. Abbott K.C. Olson S.W. Increased serum free light chains precede the presentation of immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis.J. Clin.

Light chain amyloidosis: Where are the light chains from and how they play their pathogenic role?.Blood Rev. 2017; 31: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The malignant plasma cells often emerge in the course of an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia (e.g., multiple myeloma) (7Zhang C. Huang X. Li J. Light chain amyloidosis: Where are the light chains from and how they play their pathogenic role?.Blood Rev. 2017; 31: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). During the complex maturation process responsible for the creation of antibody binding diversity, these LCs acquire amyloidogenic point mutations mostly in the VL domain, which is the main constituent of fibrils in AL amyloidosis (8Tonegawa S.

Yet, the exact mechanism by which certain mutations favor amyloid formation of antibody domains remains largely elusive. Recent cryo-EM and solid-state NMR studies of AL amyloid fibrils show that the fold of the fibril core is strikingly different from the native Ig fold suggesting that a complete structural rearrangement has to occur in the process of fibril formation (15Lecoq L.

A major enigma in this context is how different mutations shift VL domains toward the fibrillary pathway, especially if these mutations are not in the conserved framework but in the variable antigen binding regions called complementarity determining regions (CDRs). These are solvent-exposed loops connecting β-strands (31Bork P. Holm L. Sander C. The immunoglobulin fold. Structural classification, sequence patterns and common core.J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 309-320PubMed Google Scholar). In order to recognize a large variety of antigens, CDRs need to tolerate a high sequence variability, which in turn suggests that CDR point mutations should not strongly affect the thermodynamic stability and aggregation propensity of the antibody domain (32el Hawrani A.S.

Since current models cannot explain the amyloidogenic character of this variant, we set out to determine which of these mutations drive amyloid aggregation and found that specifically two of the CDR mutations are causative for fibril formation. Our findings further show that seemingly minor side chain alterations, even in poorly conserved CDRs, can destabilize the entire VL domain and drive it toward misfolding and amyloid aggregation.

FOR005-PT belongs to the λ3l LC subfamily (gene segments: IGLV3-19/IGLJ2). The related germline λ3r has been reported to be associated with AL amyloidosis (41Perfetti V. Casarini S. Palladini G. Vignarelli M.C. Klersy C. Diegoli M. Ascari E. Merlini G.

Five point mutations were identified in the patient-derived VL domain (Y31S, Y48F, G49R, N51S, G94A) compared with the germline sequence (Fig. 1A), but it was not clear which mutation causes amyloid aggregation. Four of them are located in the hypervariable CDRs according to the Kabat and Chothia numbering systems (43Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Canonical structures for the hypervariable regions of immunoglobulins.J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 901-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar, 44Wu T.T. Kabat E.A.

The mutation Y31S is located in the CDR1 region, Y48F lies in the conserved framework 2 region (FR2) right next to the beginning of CDR2. The CDR2 comprises a short, protruding loop segment containing the mutations G49R and N51S. The fifth mutation, G94A, is located in the hypervariable CDR3 loop. Residue conservation analysis with Consurf revealed the lowest degree of conservation (Consurf score = 1) for all four CDR mutations and an average conservation degree (Consurf score = 5) for the framework residue F48 in the patient sequence (Fig. S1) (45Ashkenazy H.

We further assessed aggregation-prone regions and individual mutational effects by applying the prediction tools AmylPred2, MetAmyl, and ZipperDB (46Tsolis A.C. Papandreou N.C. Iconomidou V.A.

Identifying the amylome, proteins capable of forming amyloid-like fibrils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2010; 107: 3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Amyloidogenicity predictions by these tools did not suggest significant alterations of the amyloid aggregation or steric zipper propensity of the patient VL sequence in comparison with its corresponding germline sequence (Fig. 1A). To explain structural effects of mutations in more detail, we created a homology model of FOR005-GL based on the template structure 5BV7, which exhibits 98.2% sequence identity, using the SWISS-MODEL web server (49Waterhouse A. Bertoni M. Bienert S. Studer G. Tauriello G. Gumienny R. Heer F.T. de Beer T.A.P. Rempfer C. Bordoli L. Lepore R. Schwede T. SWISS-MODEL: Homology modelling of protein structures and complexes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: W296-W303Crossref PubMed Scopus (3642) Google Scholar). Structural alignments of the homology model with the crystal structure of FOR005-PT (PDB: 5L6Q) showed that the overall structure was conserved, although the conformations of the CDR2 and CDR3 loops are altered (Fig. 1B). However, one needs to take into account that homology models are merely an approximation of the actual native protein structure. To test the biophysical properties of the proteins directly, we produced patient and germline VL domains recombinantly in E.coli and purified them to homogeneity. The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the purified proteins showed that both are properly folded and possess the typical β-sheet-rich immunoglobulin fold as indicated by the minimum at around 218 nm in the far-UV region (Fig. S2) (50Woody R.W. [4] Circular Dichroism. Biochemical Spectroscopy. Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands1995Google Scholar). Near-UV CD spectra, which represent a specific tertiary structure fingerprint, were highly similar for the two proteins. Thus, FOR005-PT and FOR005-GL seem to have nearly identical tertiary structure and topology. Additionally, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) was performed to assess the quaternary structure. As indicated by sedimentation coefficients of 1.52 and 1.59 S, respectively, both the patient and germline VL domains are monomeric in solution (Fig. S2). To test whether the two VL domains differ in their fibril formation propensities, we incubated the proteins in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 and 37 °C under continuous shaking and monitored fibril formation via the thiazol-based fluorescent dye Thioflavin T (ThT), which specifically binds to the characteristic cross-β motif in amyloid fibrils (51Gade Malmos K. Blancas-Mejia L.M. Weber B. Buchner J. Ramirez-Alvarado M. Naiki H. Otzen D. ThT 101: A primer on the use of thioflavin T to investigate amyloid formation.Amyloid. 2017; 24: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ThT-binding kinetics showed that the patient VL domain starts to form amyloid fibrils in vitro after approximately 3 days, whereas the corresponding germline protein does not engage in amyloid aggregation (Fig. 2A, Table 1). To obtain direct evidence for the presence of fibrils in the samples, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM micrographs showed fibrils only in the patient VL sample and not in the germline control (Fig. 2B). Thus, the patient VL behaved as expected and the germline protein does not show amyloidogenic behavior. FOR005 fibrils isolated from patient tissue contained only the VL domain (35Davis M.M. The evolutionary and structural ‘logic’ of antigen receptor diversity.Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Since the role of proteolytic cleavage of precursor LCs in amyloidosis is still only poorly understood (14Enqvist S. Sletten K. Westermark P. Fibril protein fragmentation pattern in systemic AL-amyloidosis.J. Pathol. 2009; 219: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we purified full-length LCs of the patient and germline variants (FOR005-PLC and FOR005-GLC, respectively) to determine whether the patient LC is also amyloidogenic. We performed fibril formation assays and transition electron microscopy and found that both LCs did not engage in the amyloidogenic pathway (Fig. 2).Table 1Stability parameters, unfolding cooperativity, and fibril formation midpoints of FOR005 constructs.VL domainTmCmmt50 pH 7.4t50 pH 6.4°CM UreakJ mol−1 M−1ddFOR005-PT43.5 ± 0.141.90 ± 0.025.99 ± 0.333.82.8FOR005-GL56.3 ± 0.114.28 ± 0.044.33 ± 0.31--GL Y31S56.1 ± 0.124.20 ± 0.035.12 ± 0.47--GL Y48F55.4 ± 0.134.15 ± 0.034.56 ± 0.32--GL G49R52.2 ± 0.102.91 ± 0.015.55 ± 0.13--GL N51S54.4 ± 0.103.44 ± 0.025.01 ± 0.27--GL G94A50.5 ± 0.173.25 ± 0.054.95 ± 0.99--GL Y31S/G94A50.3 ± 0.153.31 ± 0.035.17 ± 0.58--GL Y48F/G94A51.9 ± 0.103.22 ± 0.025.32 ± 0.28--GL G49R/G94A47.0 ± 0.092.09 ± 0.026.69 ± 0.418.94.4GL N51S/G94A48.6 ± 0.082.56 ± 0.025.98 ± 0.33-11.5Thermal transitions were obtained by recording the CD signal at 205 nm between 20 to 90 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min.

Fibril formation assays were carried out at 37 °C, pH 7.4 or 6.4 under continouos shaking in a Tecan Genios platereader. The t50 values represent the time point at which fibril formation is 50% completed. To determine differences between the two VL domains regarding their thermodynamic properties in more detail, we investigated their stabilities by chemical and thermal denaturation experiments. Unfolding transitions in the presence of increasing urea concentrations were performed to assess the chemical domain stability and unfolding cooperativity of the VL domains (Fig. 2, Table 1). The patient VL domain showed a midpoint of unfolding at a urea concentration (Cm) of 1.90 M, whereas for the germline domain, the midpoint is at 4.28 M urea (Fig. 2, Table 1). We assessed the reversibility of urea-induced unfolding by fluorescence spectroscopy and found that both VL domains cannot be completely refolded into their native structure within 24 h at room temperature (Fig. S2). It should be noted, however, that the germline VL exhibits a higher degree of unfolding reversibility than the patient variant (Fig. S2). We applied a two-state fit model to our transition data to calculate unfolding free energies (ΔGun). However, this is in principle only possible if unfolding is completely reversible. Since this is not the case under the conditions used (Fig. S2), these results do not represent true ΔGun values but are rather apparent unfolding free energies (ΔGunapp) (Table S1). In thermal denaturation experiments, the patient-derived protein exhibited a melting temperature (Tm) of 43.5 °C, whereas the germline protein showed a melting temperature of 56.3 °C. The Tm values correspond to the temperatures at which 50% of the protein is unfolded. Since thermal unfolding of both FOR005-PT and FOR005-GL is also irreversible (Fig. S2), the obtained transition midpoints represent apparent melting temperatures (Table 1). These data show that the patient VL domain has a significantly decreased thermodynamic stability compared with its germline counterpart (Table 1). While the results described above show that the patient-specific mutations affect conformational stability and fibril formation, it was not possible to rationalize which of the mutations are responsible for amyloidogenesis. To determine the specific effects of each of the five point mutations, we replaced them individually in the germline sequence by the respective patient residues (Y31S, Y48F, G49R, N51S, and G94A). CD spectroscopy and AUC analysis of the mutants showed that all point mutants adopted the conserved β-sheet structure and were monomeric in solution (Fig. S3). Additionally, highly similar near-UV CD spectra suggest that the amino acid substitutions have only minor effects on the global tertiary structure of the antibody domain (Fig. S3). Thermal unfolding experiments of the germline VL domain constructs containing the individual patient mutations showed the largest stability decrease for the G94A mutant with a Tm value of 50.5 °C and the second largest effect for the G49R mutant with a transition temperature of 52.2 °C. The thermal stabilities of the remaining mutants Y31S, Y48F, and N51S were only slightly decreased with transition midpoints temperatures of 56.1 °C, 55.4 °C, and 54.4 °C, respectively (Table 1, Fig. S3). In the case of chemical unfolding, the strongest decrease in stability was observed for the G49R mutant with a Cm value of 2.91 M urea, whereas the G94A variant unfolded at a concentration of 3.25 M urea. Both the G49R and G94A variant show comparable Δ"

Here, we demonstrated that elevated AR expression was positively correlated with tumor-originated vasculogenesis in ccRCC patients. Consistently, in vitro research revealed AR promoted VM formation in ccRCC cell lines via modulating lncRNA-TANAR/TWIST1 signals. Mechanism dissection showed that AR could increase lncRNA-TANAR (TANAR) expression through binding to the androgen response elements (AREs) located in its promoter region. Moreover, we found that TANAR could impede nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) of TWIST1 mRNA by direct interaction with TWIST1 5'UTR. A preclinical study using in vivo mouse model with orthotopic xenografts of ccRCC cells further confirmed the in vitro data. Together, these results illustrated that AR-mediated TANAR signals might play a crucial role in ccRCC VM formation and metastasis, and targeting this newly identified AR/TANAR/TWIST1 signaling may help in the development of a novel anti-angiogenesis therapy to better suppress the ccRCC progression."

Previous studies have shown that seaweeds grown under such conditions may alter their growth and photosynthetic capacity. It is not clear how such alterations might impact interactions between seaweed and herbivores, e . g . through changes in feeding rates, nutritional value, or defense levels. Changes in seaweeds are particularly important for coastal food webs, as they are key primary producers and often habitat-forming species. We cultured the habitat-forming brown seaweed Fucus vesiculosus for 30 days in projected future pCO 2 (1100 μatm) with genetically identical controls in ambient pCO 2 (400 μatm). Thereafter the macroalgae were exposed to grazing by Littorina littorea , acclimated to the relevant pCO 2 -treatment. We found increased growth (measured as surface area increase), decreased tissue strength in a tensile strength test, and decreased chemical defense (phlorotannins) levels in seaweeds exposed to high pCO 2 -levels. The herbivores exposed to elevated pCO 2 -levels showed improved condition index, decreased consumption, but no significant change in feeding preference. Fucoid seaweeds such as F . vesiculosus play important ecological roles in coastal habitats and are often foundation species, with a key role for ecosystem structure and function. The change in surface area and associated decrease in breaking force, as demonstrated by our results, indicate that F . vesiculosus grown under elevated levels of pCO 2 may acquire an altered morphology and reduced tissue strength. This, together with increased wave energy in coastal ecosystems due to climate change, could have detrimental effects by reducing both habitat and food availability for herbivores."

https://openalex.org/W3125189663,"Since their discovery decades ago, the primary physiological and pathological effects of potassium channels have been attributed to their ion conductance, which sets membrane potential and repolarizes action potentials. For example, Kv3 family channels regulate neurotransmitter release by repolarizing action potentials. Here we report a surprising but crucial function independent of potassium conductance: by organizing the F-actin cytoskeleton in mouse nerve terminals, the Kv3.3 protein facilitates slow endocytosis, rapid endocytosis, vesicle mobilization to the readily releasable pool, and recovery of synaptic depression during repetitive firing. A channel mutation that causes spinocerebellar ataxia inhibits endocytosis, vesicle mobilization, and synaptic transmission during repetitive firing by disrupting the ability of the channel to nucleate F-actin. These results unmask novel functions of potassium channels in endocytosis and vesicle mobilization crucial for sustaining synaptic transmission during repetitive firing. Potassium channel mutations that impair these ""non-conducting"" functions may thus contribute to generation of diverse neurological disorders."

https://openalex.org/W3122204533,"Introduction This study aimed to explore the experiences of healthcare access in a diverse sample of trans and gender diverse individuals with complex needs using qualitative methods. We recruited 12 individuals using trans community-based networks facilitated by the Gender Centre. Each individual participated in an in-depth, semi structured interview conducted by a peer interviewer. Interviews were analysed thematically. Findings Participants had a range of complex health needs to manage, including ongoing access to gender-affirming hormones, mental health care and sexual health care. Some also had chronic diseases. Accordingly, scheduling appointments and affording the co-payments required were major preoccupations. Most participants were not in full time work, and economic hardship proved to be a major compounding factor in issues of healthcare access, impacting on the choice of clinician or practice. Other barriers to accessing health included issues within health services, such as disrespectful attitudes, misgendering, ‘deadnaming’ (calling the person by their previous name), displaying an excessive interest is aspects of the participants’ life that were irrelevant to the consultation, and displaying ignorance of trans services such that the participants felt an obligation to educate them. In addition, participants noted how stereotyped ideas of trans people could result in inaccurate assumptions about their healthcare needs. Positive attributes of services were identified as respectful communication styles, clean, welcoming spaces, and signs that indicated professionalism, care and openness, such as relevant information pamphlets and visibility of LGBTIQ service orientation. Participants valued peer-based advice very highly, and some would act on and trust medical advice from peers above advice from medical professionals. Conclusion These findings demonstrate a need for comprehensive wrap-around service provision for trans people with complex needs which includes a substantial peer-based component, and addresses physical and mental health and social services conveniently and affordably."

Most of the risk factors contributing to the development of congenital anomalies are uncertain; however, genetic factors, environmental factors and multifactorial inheritance are found to be risk factors. Regardless of their clinical importance, there are little/no studies conducted directly related to predisposing risk factors in southwestern Ethiopia. Objective The study aimed to determine the associated risk factors with congenital anomalies among newborns in southwestern Ethiopia. Methods Case—control study was conducted on newborns and their mothers in six purposively selected hospitals in southwestern Ethiopia from May 2016 to May 2018. Data was collected after evaluation of the neonates for the presence of congenital anomalies using the standard pretested checklist. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. P &lt;0.01 was set as statistically significant. Results Risk factors such as unidentified medicinal usage in the first three months of pregnancy (AOR = 3.435; 99% CI: 2.012–5.863), exposure to pesticide (AOR = 3.926; 99% CI: 1.266–12.176), passive smoking (AOR = 4.104; 99% CI: 1.892–8.901), surface water as sources of drinking (AOR = 2.073; 99% CI: 1.221–3.519), folic acid supplementation during the early pregnancy (AOR = 0.428; 99% CI: 0.247–0.740) were significantly associated with the congenital anomalies. Conclusions In this study, risk factors such as passive smoking, exposure to pesticides, chemicals and use of surface water as a source of drinking during early pregnancy had a significant association with congenital anomalies. There is a need to continuously provide health information for the community on how to prevent and control predisposing risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W3123330958,"The number of COVID-19 infections is key for accurately monitoring the pandemics. However, due to differential testing policies, asymptomatic individuals and limited large-scale testing availability, it is challenging to detect all cases. Seroprevalence studies aim to address this gap by retrospectively assessing the number of infections, but they can be expensive and time-intensive, limiting their use to specific population subgroups. In this paper, we propose a complementary approach that combines estimated (1) infection fatality rates (IFR) using a Bayesian melding SEIR model with (2) reported case-fatality rates (CFR) in order to indirectly estimate the fraction of people ever infected (from the total population) and detected (from the ever infected). We apply the technique to the U.S. due to their remarkable regional diversity and because they count with almost a quarter of all global confirmed cases and deaths. We obtain that the IFR varies from 1.25% (0.39–2.16%, 90% CI) in Florida, the most aged population, to 0.69% in Utah (0.21–1.30%, 90% CI), the youngest population. By September 8, 2020, we estimate that at least five states have already a fraction of people ever infected between 10% and 20% (New Jersey, New York, Massachussets, Connecticut, and District of Columbia). The state with the highest estimated fraction of people ever infected is New Jersey with 17.3% (10.0, 55.8, 90% CI). Moreover, our results indicate that with a probability of 90 percent the fraction of detected people among the ever infected since the beginning of the epidemic has been less than 50% in 15 out of the 20 states analyzed in this paper. Our approach can be a valuable tool that complements seroprevalence studies and indicates how efficient have testing policies been since the beginning of the outbreak."

These ligands displayed diverse activity profiles, providing the variance required to identify target genes and coregulator interactions that were highly predictive of their effects on myocyte glucose disposal and protein balance. Their anti-inflammatory effects were linked to glucose disposal but not muscle atrophy. This approach also predicted selective modulation in vivo, identifying compounds that were muscle-sparing or anabolic for protein balance and mitochondrial potential. Ligand class analysis defined the mechanistic links between the ligand-receptor interface and ligand-driven physiological outcomes, a general approach that can be applied to any ligand-regulated allosteric signaling system."
https://openalex.org/W3121140739,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects cognition and memory. Recent advances have helped identify many clinical sub-types in AD. Mounting evidence point toward structural polymorphism among fibrillar aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ) to being responsible for the phenotypes and clinical manifestations. In the emerging paradigm of polymorphism and prion-like propagation of aggregates in AD, the role of low molecular weight soluble oligomers, which are long known to be the primary toxic agents, in effecting phenotypes remains inconspicuous. In this study, we present the characterization of three soluble oligomers of Aβ42, namely 14LPOs, 16LPOs, and GM1Os with discreet biophysical and biochemical properties generated using lysophosphatidyl glycerols and GM1 gangliosides. The results indicate that the oligomers share some biophysical similarities but display distinctive differences with GM1Os. Unlike the other two, GM1Os were observed to be complexed with the lipid upon isolation. It also differs mainly in detection by conformation-sensitive dyes and conformation-specific antibodies, temperature and enzymatic stability, and in the ability to propagate morphologically-distinct fibrils. GM1Os also show distinguishable biochemical behavior with pronounced neuronal toxicity. Furthermore, all the oligomers induce cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and plaque burden in transgenic AD mice, which seems to be a consistent feature among all lipid-derived oligomers, but 16LPOs and GM1Os displayed significantly higher effect than the others. These results establish a correlation between molecular features of Aβ42 oligomers and their distinguishable effects in transgenic AD mice attuned by lipid characteristics, and therefore help bridge the knowledge gap in understanding how oligomer conformers could elicit AD phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3121309175,"Traditionally, lipolysis has been regarded as an enzymatic activity that liberates fatty acids as metabolic fuel. However, recent work has shown that novel substrates, including a variety of lipid compounds such as fatty acids and their derivatives, release lipolysis products that act as signaling molecules and transcriptional modulators. While these studies have expanded the role of lipolysis, the mechanisms underpinning lipolysis signaling are not fully defined. Here, we uncover a new mechanism regulating glucose uptake, whereby activation of lipolysis, in response to elevated cAMP, leads to the stimulation of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) degradation. This, in turn, selectively induces glucose transporter 1 surface localization and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and increases lactate production. Interestingly, cAMP-induced glucose uptake via degradation of TXNIP is largely dependent upon adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and not hormone-sensitive lipase or monoacylglycerol lipase. Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of ATGL alone prevents cAMP-dependent TXNIP degradation and thus significantly decreases glucose uptake and lactate secretion. Conversely, overexpression of ATGL amplifies the cAMP response, yielding increased glucose uptake and lactate production. Similarly, knockdown of TXNIP elicits enhanced basal glucose uptake and lactate secretion, and increased cAMP further amplifies this phenotype. Overexpression of TXNIP reduces basal and cAMP-stimulated glucose uptake and lactate secretion. As a proof of concept, we replicated these findings in human primary adipocytes and observed TXNIP degradation and increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion upon elevated cAMP signaling. Taken together, our results suggest a crosstalk between ATGL-mediated lipolysis and glucose uptake.

Adipose tissue metabolism plays a critical role in maintaining healthy homeostasis for glucose and lipid metabolism (1Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Adipocytes as regulators of energy balance and glucose homeostasis.Nature. 2006; 444: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). Insulin mediated triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, and its dissipation through lipolysis is an important physiological process, which is tightly controlled and under metabolic regulation (2Czech M.P. Tencerova M. Pedersen D.J. Aouadi M. Insulin signalling mechanisms for triacylglycerol storage.Diabetologia. 2013; 56: 949-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). When in positive energy balance, during the postprandial period, insulin rapidly stimulates glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) surface translocation, which mediates glucose uptake. This is an acute insulin-stimulated process that is followed by TAG formation (3Haeusler R.A. McGraw T.E. Accili D. Biochemical and cellular properties of insulin receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol.

In a similar way, the counter-regulatory process during extended periods of starvation, through the action of the lipases, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL), lipolysis is activated by elevated levels of cAMP, which ultimately leads to the release of free fatty acid (FFA) (4Zechner R.

Mice with a targeted deletion of the various lipases display a vast range of phenotypes involving release of FFA, which are dependent upon tissue specificity and diet composition (6Schreiber R.

Interesting studies in this area include the roles of diacylglycerol and ceramide, reported to negatively regulate glucose uptake and lead to insulin resistance (9Sokolowska E. Blachnio-Zabielska A.

Similarly, lipid derivatives, such as arachidonic acid and the recently discovered hydroxylated fatty acid, positively regulate glucose uptake (11Yore M.M. Syed I. Moraes-Vieira P.M. Zhang T.

In conclusion, lipolytic activity is not only a mechanism to release FFA but also it is increasingly clear that these activities play an important role in regulating other modalities of metabolism (4Zechner R. Zimmermann R. Eichmann T.O. Kohlwein S.D. Haemmerle G. Lass A. Madeo F. FAT SIGNALS--lipases and lipolysis in lipid metabolism and signaling.Cell Metab. 2012; 15: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Glucose uptake is fundamental for cell metabolism and is mediated through a set of GLUTs and their associated machinery. Specialized cells, such as adipocytes, express GLUT4, which is largely dependent on insulin signaling for activation and surface translocation (13Leto D. Saltiel A.R. Regulation of glucose transport by insulin: Traffic control of GLUT4.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 14Klip A. McGraw T.E. James D.E. Thirty sweet years of GLUT4.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 11369-11381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Another transporter, GLUT1, is more ubiquitously expressed and is also important for adipocyte glucose uptake. Unlike GLUT4, the machinery, signaling, and metabolic regulation in relation to GLUT1 are less studied. Some of the central molecules for the glucose uptake process, such as AS160 phosphorylation and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) expression levels, which are directly linked to glucose uptake, are regulated by both anabolic and catabolic signals and affect both GLUT1 and GLUT4 transporter surface translocation (15Waldhart A.N. Dykstra H. Peck A.S. Boguslawski E.A. Madaj Z.B. Wen J. Veldkamp K. Hollowell M. Zheng B. Cantley L.C. McGraw T.E. Wu N.

AMPK-dependent degradation of TXNIP upon energy stress leads to enhanced glucose uptake via GLUT1.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 1167-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The adipocyte expresses both GLUT1 and GLUT4, together with several lipases, and can hence be considered a rheostat for glucose and FFA metabolism that responds to a variety of both anabolic and catabolic signals. Here, we show that elevated levels of cAMP rapidly degrade TXNIP in a dose-dependent manner and thereby release GLUT1 for surface localization. GLUT1 surface localization stimulates glucose uptake, which to a large extent is further metabolized to lactate. We uncover a mechanism by which ATGL activity regulates cAMP-dependent TXNIP degradation that in turn regulates GLUT1-, but not GLUT4-, mediated glucose uptake in adipocytes. Besides providing glycerol and fatty acids, lipolysis also generates several lipid derivatives and substrate molecules that regulate metabolism through multiple mechanisms, including gene transcription and post-translational modifications (4Zechner R. Zimmermann R. Eichmann T.O. Kohlwein S.D. Haemmerle G. Lass A. Madeo F.

A good example hereof are studies in which diacylglycerol, ceramide, and saturated fatty acids, all linked to lipolysis, have been shown to regulate metabolism (4Zechner R. Zimmermann R.

Palmitate modulates the early steps of insulin signalling pathway in pancreatic islets.FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We found that TXNIP, a gatekeeper protein for GLUTs, is rapidly degraded following 8-bromine-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) (hereafter also termed as cAMP) treatment in adipocytes. We performed concentration- and time-dependent experiments with 8-Br-cAMP to determine the effective dose and period. We observed that 100 to 250 μM cAMP concentration for 2 h significantly reduced TXNIP at the protein level (Fig. 1A). We also exposed 3T3-L1 adipocytes to 8-Br-cAMP in a time-dependent manner up to 2 h and found that degradation of TXNIP initiated from 60 min onward (Fig. 1B). To determine whether other standard stimuli that increase the level of cAMP also cause degradation of TXNIP, we used multiple standard stimuli, such as forskolin, isoproterenol, and epinephrine. We found that, in parallel with 8-Br-cAMP, forskolin, isoproterenol, and epinephrine also significantly degrade TXNIP levels (Fig. 1, C1–C3). Interestingly, cAMP-stimulated TXNIP protein expression changes are not reflected in mRNA levels, suggesting that cAMP-mediated TXNIP degradation is a post-translational event (Fig. S1). TXNIP, being a regulator of glucose uptake, retains and internalizes GLUTs, thus preventing their surface localization. TXNIP degradation has been linked to the uptake of glucose (16Wu N. Zheng B. Shaywitz A. Dagon Y. Tower C. Bellinger G. Shen C.H. Wen J. Asara J. McGraw T.E. Kahn B.B. Cantley L.C. AMPK-dependent degradation of TXNIP upon energy stress leads to enhanced glucose uptake via GLUT1.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 1167-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In a next experiment, we measured 3H-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DOG) uptake. We found that 8-Br-cAMP, as expected, increased glucose uptake both in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which is paralleled with TXNIP degradation (Fig. 1, D and E). Similar to that observed with 8-Br-cAMP, administration of other cAMP agonists, such as forskolin, isoproterenol, and epinephrine, also showed increased glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1F). We took an aliquot of supernatant after 2 h of cAMP incubation and measured the lactate level. We found that, similar to that with glucose uptake, lactate production is concomitantly increased with increasing concentrations of cAMP, and this was also found for other cAMP agonists (Fig. 1, G and H). Both protein kinase B (AKT) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) have previously been shown to regulate glucose uptake via TXNIP degradation (15Waldhart A.N. Dykstra H. Peck A.S. Boguslawski E.A. Madaj Z.B. Wen J. Veldkamp K. Hollowell M. Zheng B. Cantley L.C. McGraw T.E. Wu N.

AMPK-dependent degradation of TXNIP upon energy stress leads to enhanced glucose uptake via GLUT1.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 1167-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether AKT and AMPK inhibition could control cAMP-mediated glucose uptake. Coincubation with the inhibitors, MK2206 (AKT) or compound C (AMPK), did not reduce either the cAMP-mediated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes or TXNIP degradation (Fig. 1I, lower panel). These data suggest that cAMP acts via another pathway. Furthermore, we also tested insulin signaling activation, which was found to be unchanged (Fig. S2), and further agrees with our AKT inhibition data (Fig 1I). We observed that the PKA inhibitor, H89, significantly reduces cAMP-mediated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and TXNIP degradation (Fig. 1I, lower panel). Interestingly, these effects were present in neither 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (Fig. 1J, lower panel) nor C2C12 myoblasts, two cell types lacking significant intracellular triglyceride stores and associated signaling pathways (Fig. S3). However, knockdown of TXNIP in preadipocytes using an siRNA approach yielded a similar upregulation of glucose uptake as observed in adipocytes in response to cAMP-mediated TXNIP degradation (Fig. 1K, lower panel). These data support the role of TXNIP as a potent regulator of glucose uptake. Since cells not responding to cAMP with increased glucose uptake (preadipocytes and C2C12 cells) lack lipid droplets and associated pathways, which appear pivotal for TXNIP degradation, it is possible that they therefore could not upregulate glucose uptake in response to cAMP, despite the presence of the GLUT1 transporter (Fig. S4). Moreover, ectopic ATGL expression in preadipocytes was not sufficient to induce cAMP responsiveness as a signal for TXNIP degradation and glucose uptake (Fig. S5, A and B). Elevated cAMP levels in adipocytes also leads to phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) to initiate glycogenolysis. To investigate whether GSK3 phosphorylation contributes to the lactate production observed (Fig. 1G) by providing internal glucose substrate for lactate secretion, we used the GSK3-specific inhibitor, SB216763. We found that GSK inhibition does not cause any broad alteration in the cAMP response, which makes any direct involvement of GSK3 kinase unlikely (Fig. S6, A and B). Finally, to rule out any off-target effects of 8-Br-cAMP because of the chemical 8-Br moiety, or any similar overlapping pathway activated by cGMP, we used the similar analog, 8-Br-cGMP. We observed that 8-Br-cGMP did not show any alteration at the dose that is effective for 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. S7). We next used atglistatin, a specific inhibitor of ATGL, which is the first lipase activated in response to elevated cAMP—primary signal for lipolysis (18Schweiger M. Romauch M. Schreiber R. Grabner G.F. Hutter S. Kotzbeck P. Benedikt P. Eichmann T.O. Yamada S. Knittelfelder O. Diwoky C. Doler C. Mayer N. De Cecco W.

Signalling mechanisms regulating lipolysis.Cell Signal. 2006; 18: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that atglistatin seems to block the cAMP-mediated TXNIP degradation as shown by immunoblot and densitometry analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). As hypothesized, and linked to TXNIP degradation, we found that atglistatin also completely abolished the cAMP stimulatory effect on glucose uptake and lactate production (Fig. 2, C and D). We further investigated the potency of atglistatin in inhibiting lipolysis by measuring the lipolytic end product, glycerol. We measured atglistatin-mediated ATGL suppression by both varying cAMP concentration and using several doses of atglistatin (Fig. S8, A and B). We observed that atglistatin robustly inhibited the cAMP-stimulated glycerol secretion without affecting HSL phosphorylation in the same setting, suggesting that atglistatin specifically blocks ATGL activity as previously reported (18Schweiger M. Romauch M. Schreiber R. Grabner G.F. Hutter S. Kotzbeck P. Benedikt P. Eichmann T.O. Yamada S. Knittelfelder O. Diwoky C. Doler C. Mayer N. De Cecco W.

Biol. 2013; 9: 785-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (Fig. S8C). In conclusion, these results indicate that ATGL activity is necessary for cAMP-induced and TXNIP degradation–mediated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It further suggests a link between glucose and lipid metabolism regulated by ATGL activity. Cellular lipolysis is essentially carried out by three lipases: ATGL, HSL, and MGL, which work in concert to break down TAG to fatty acids and glycerol. Our data suggest that lipolysis leads to degradation of TXNIP, and linked to this, increased glucose uptake and lactate secretion. To study the relative contribution of these three lipases to the observed phenotype of cAMP-mediated glucose uptake, lactate secretion, and TXNIP degradation, we knocked down ATGL, HSL, or MGL in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 3, A1–A3). In agreement with our previous results, we found that cAMP-mediated glucose uptake is largely regulated through ATGL activity as knockdown of ATGL almost completely abrogated the cAMP-mediated effects. This is very similar to the atglistatin effect, which is a specific inhibitor of ATGL (Fig. 2, C and D). Unlike ATGL, HSL and MGL knockdown still maintain a significant response to cAMP in terms of glucose uptake and lactate production (Fig. 3, B and C). In line with these findings, we could demonstrate that knockdown of only ATGL led to significant inhibition of TXNIP degradation (Fig. 3D). We further validated our results with stable knockdown for ATGL though a specific shRNA approach. We observed that, similar to atglistatin and siRNA knockdown, shRNA-mediated knockdown of ATGL completely abrogates the cAMP-mediated glucose uptake and inhibits TXNIP degradation (Fig. S9, A and B). Overexpression (OE) of ATGL in 3T3-L1 adipocytes elicits a significant increase in glucose uptake and lactate secretion (Fig. 3, E–G). This further supports the notion that ATGL-mediated lipolysis is necessary for cAMP-induced glucose uptake and lactate secretion. GLUTs are the facilitative transporters for glucose uptake. Adipocytes express both GLUT1 and GLUT4. GLUT4 is a well-studied insulin-regulated transporter, whereas GLUT1 regulation in adipocytes is still not fully understood (21Hauner H. Rohrig K. Spelleken M. Liu L.S. Eckel J. Development of insulin-responsive glucose uptake and GLUT4 expression in differentiating human adipocyte precursor cells.Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab.

TXNIP serves as a gatekeeper for glucose uptake through internalizing both GLUT1 and GLUT4 (15Waldhart A.N. Dykstra H. Peck A.S. Boguslawski E.A. Madaj Z.B. Wen J. Veldkamp K. Hollowell M. Zheng B.

TXNIP in metabolic regulation: Physiological role and therapeutic outlook.Curr. Drug Targets. 2017; 18: 1095-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We used specific siRNAs to knockdown GLUT1 or GLUT4 to investigate the roles of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 4A). We found that GLUT1 knockdown completely abolished cAMP-mediated glucose uptake, whereas GLUT4 knockdown had essentially no effect on cAMP-mediated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as compared with a control siRNA (Fig. 4B). Similar trends were found for lactate release (Fig. 4C). This suggests that cAMP acts via ATGL and that this triggers a TXNIP degradation that specifically stimulates GLUT1 but not GLUT4 surface localization. We also adapted a complementary approach using stable knockdown of GLUT1 through shRNA in adipocytes and observed, as expected, a blunting of cAMP-mediated glucose uptake (Fig. S10). Thus, the cAMP-mediated and TXNIP degradation–linked increase in glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes is mediated by GLUT1 and not GLUT4. As surrogate markers for surface localization of GLUTs, we used GLUT1 and GLUT4 tagged with FLAG and human influenza hemagglutinin (HA), respectively. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, transfected to stably express these constructs, we used an indirect ELISA method to quantitate the surface to total ratio of GLUT1 and GLUT4. Mimicking previous glucose uptake experiments (Fig. 1D), we observed a dose-dependent increase in 8-Br-cAMP–linked increase in surface localization of GLUT1 (Fig. 4D) but not of GLUT4 (Fig. 4E). HA–GLUT4 constructs remain unresponsive to cAMP stimulation, however, as expected, insulin rapidly caused GLUT4 translocation in a dose-dependent manner, which was abolished by the AKT inhibitor, MK2206 (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, we tested whether cAMP-mediated GLUT1 surface localization was affected by pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of ATGL. We also found that ATGL inhibition by atglistatin or ATGL knockdown significantly reduces cAMP-mediated GLUT1 surface localization (Fig. 4, G and H). Moreover, we found that TXNIP knockdown significantly upregulated GLUT1 surface localization and that was further amplified by 8-Br-cAMP (Fig. 4I). In conclusion, it appears that the increase in glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes mediated by cAMP stimulation and linked to TXNIP degradation is mediated by GLUT1 but not GLUT4. We used siRNA to knockdown TXNIP expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 5A) and observed that TXNIP knockdown significantly upregulated glucose uptake in the basal state and also significantly amplified the cAMP response (Fig. 5B). There was also a modest effect on lactate secretion (Fig. 5C). In a next step, we used retrovirus to stably overexpress mouse TXNIP with a FLAG tag (Fig. 5D). TXNIP OE reduced glucose uptake in both the basal and cAMP-stimulated state (Fig. 5E), which was in stark contrast to the TXNIP knockdown phenotype (Fig. 5B). Similarly, lactate secretion was significantly downregulated (Fig. 5F). Enhanced lactate secretion, a sign of stimulated glycolysis, might be a way to rapidly replete the total cellular ATP pool. Thus, we observed that cAMP, in a time-dependent manner, reduced the total ATP pool (Fig. 6A), which is in concurrence with TXNIP degradation (Fig. 1B), glucose uptake (Fig. 1E), and lactate secretion (Fig. 1G) data. Moreover, coincubation with an ATGL inhibitor restricted the decrease in the ATP pool (Fig. 6B). Overall, these evidences suggest that adipocytes, in response to acute elevated cAMP levels, upregulate glycolysis, which in turn acts to replenish the ATP pool.Figure 6cAMP-stimulated depletion of ATP might be responsible for enhancing glycolysis. A and B, differentiated adipocyte cells were treated with cAMP in (A) a time-dependent manner (N = 3) or (B) pretreated with atglistatin for 20 min (N = 3). Cell lysates were collected, and ATP measurements were performed as per manufacturer's protocol. All values were then subtracted with the corresponding protein well and presented as total ATP/milligram protein. For ATP measurements, results are normalized mean ± SD of three biologically independent experiments. Two-way ANOVA statistics was used for A and B. Holm–Sidak multiple comparison test was used to compare the selected pairs of means.

Similar to that we have observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, human primary adipocytes degrade TXNIP in response to increased cAMP stimulation (Fig. 7A). We also observed increased glucose uptake and lactate production (Fig. 7, B and C). In conclusion, these results indicate that the cAMP-mediated effects observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes also are present in primary human adipocytes. As energy substrates, lipids and carbohydrates are crucial for cellular ATP production. Lipolysis will, in several steps, using a series of lipases, catalyze the breakdown of TAG into FFA and glycerol. FFA will be transported into the mitochondria and undergo successive steps of beta oxidation, which will ultimately generate ATP. Long chain carbohydrates will be broken down to glucose in the small intestine and subsequently taken up by cells via the circulation. Glucose will be metabolized to release ATP during glyco"
https://openalex.org/W3121954630,"Members of the ADF/cofilin family of regulatory proteins bind actin filaments cooperatively, locally change actin subunit conformation and orientation, and sever filaments at ""boundaries"" between bare and cofilin-occupied segments. A cluster of bound cofilin introduces two distinct classes of boundaries due to the intrinsic polarity of actin filaments, one at the ""pointed"" end side and the other at the ""barbed"" end-side of the cluster; severing occurs more readily at the pointed end side of the cluster (""fast-severing"" boundary) than the barbed end side (""slow-severing"" boundary). A recent electron-cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) model of the slow-severing boundary revealed structural ""defects"" at the interface that potentially contribute to severing. However, the structure of the fast-severing boundary remains uncertain. Here, we use extensive molecular dynamics simulations to produce atomic resolution models of both severing boundaries. Our equilibrated simulation model of the slow-severing boundary is consistent with the cryo-EM structural model. Simulations indicate that actin subunits at both boundaries adopt structures intermediate between those of bare and cofilin-bound actin subunits. These ""intermediate"" states have compromised intersubunit contacts, but those at the slow-severing boundary are stabilized by cofilin bridging interactions, accounting for its lower fragmentation probability. Simulations where cofilin proteins are removed from cofilactin filaments favor a mechanism in which a cluster of two contiguously bound cofilins is needed to fully stabilize the cofilactin conformation, promote cooperative binding interactions, and accelerate filament severing. Together, these studies provide a molecular-scale foundation for developing coarse-grained and theoretical descriptions of cofilin-mediated actin filament severing."
https://openalex.org/W3125927680,"Maternal effects on offspring growth can impact survival and evolution of natural and domesticated populations. Genetic correlation estimates often support a negative relationship between direct and maternal effects. However, the genetic underpinnings whereby this antagonism operates are unclear. In pigs, sow feeding status and body composition condition piglet development and growth. We hypothesized that variants in genes impacting these traits may be causative of maternal influences that could be antagonistic to the direct effects for piglet growth. A recessive missense mutation (C&gt;T) in the porcine leptin receptor ( LEPR ) gene (rs709596309) has been identified as the possible causal polymorphism for increased feed intake and fatness. Using data from a Duroc line, we show that the TT sows exerted a negative impact on the body weight of their offspring at the end of the growing period of similar extent to the positive direct effect of the TT genotype over each individual. Thus, TT pigs from TT dams were about as heavy as CC and CT (C–) pigs from C–dams, but TT pigs from C–dams were around 5% heavier than C–pigs from TT dams. In contrast, body composition was only influenced by LEPR direct effects. This antagonism is due to a higher propensity of TT pigs for self-maintenance rather than for offspring investment. We show that TT pigs consumed more feed, favored fatty acid uptake over release, and produced lighter piglets at weaning than their C–counterparts. We conclude that LEPR underlies a transgenerational mechanism for energy distribution that allocates resources to the sow or the offspring according to whether selective pressure is exerted before or after weaning."
https://openalex.org/W3121145612,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a devastating illness affecting over 40 million people worldwide. Intraneuronal rise of amyloid beta in its oligomeric forms (iA β Os), has been linked to the pathogenesis of AD by disrupting cytosolic Ca 2+ homeostasis. However, the specific mechanisms of action are still under debate and intense effort is ongoing to improve our understanding of the crucial steps involved in the mechanisms of A β Os toxicity. We report the development of a mathematical model describing a proposed mechanism by which stimulation of Phospholipase C (PLC) by iA β O, triggers production of IP 3 with consequent abnormal release of Ca 2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through activation of IP 3 receptor (IP 3 R) Ca 2+ channels. After validating the model using experimental data, we quantify the effects of intracellular rise in iA β Os on model solutions. Our model validates a dose-dependent influence of iA β Os on IP 3 -mediated Ca 2+ signaling. We investigate Ca 2+ signaling patterns for small and large iA β Os doses and study the role of various parameters on Ca 2+ signals. Uncertainty quantification and partial rank correlation coefficients are used to better understand how the model behaves under various parameter regimes. Our model predicts that iA β O alter IP 3 R sensitivity to IP 3 for large doses.

https://openalex.org/W3121339700,"A compact fabric antenna structure integrated with electromagnetic bandgap structures (EBGs) covering the desired frequency spectrum between 2.36 GHz and 2.40 GHz for Medical Body-Area Networks (MBANs), is introduced. The needs of flexible system applications, the antenna is preferably low-profile, compact, directive, and robust to the human body's loading effect have to be satisfied. The EBGs are attractive solutions for such requirements and provide efficient performance. In contrast to earlier documented EBG backed antenna designs, the proposed EBG behaved as shielding from the antenna to the human body, reduced the size, and acted as a radiator. The EBGs reduce the frequency detuning due to the human body and decrease the back radiation, improving the antenna efficiency. The proposed antenna system has an overall dimension of 46×46×2.4 mm 3 . The computed and experimental results achieved a gain of 7.2 dBi, a Front to Back Ratio (FBR) of 12.2 dB, and an efficiency of 74.8%, respectively. The Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) demonstrates a reduction of more than 95% compared to the antenna without EBGs. Moreover, the antenna performance robustness to human body loading and bending is also studied experimentally. Hence, the integrated antenna-EBG is a suitable candidate for many wearable applications, including healthcare devices and related applications."

This study was aimed to assess the prevalence and determinants of E . coli O157:H7 related to diarrhea among under-five children with acute diarrhea. Methods A cross-sectional study design was carried out in 2018 on 378 under-five-year children recruited randomly from hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia. Stool specimens were collected and processed using enrichment, differential and selective medium. Among isolates, E . coli O157:H7 was confirmed using latex test (Oxoid, Basingstoke, Hants, England). Factors associated with E . coli O157:H7 infection were identified using binary and multivariable logistic regression. Associations were reported by odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Results The prevalence of E . coli O157:H7 related diarrhea was 15.3% (95%CI: 11.8–19.5). The E . coli O157:H7 infection was positively associated with rural residence (AOR;3.75, 95%CI:1.26–11.20), consumption of undercooked meat (AOR;3.95, 95%CI: 1.23–12.67), raw vegetables and/or fruit juice (AOR;3.37, 95%CI:1.32–8.62), presence of bloody diarrhea (AOR;4.42, 95% CI:1.78–10.94), number of under-five children in a household (AOR;7.16, 95%CI: 2.90–17.70), presence of person with diarrhea in a household (AOR;4.22, 95% CI: 1.84–12.69), owning domestic animal (AOR;3.87, 95% CI: 1.48–10.12) and uneducated mother (AOR;3.14, 95%CI: 1.05–9.42). Conclusion The Prevalence of E . coli O157:H7 related diarrhea among under-five children is relatively high in Eastern Ethiopia. The E. coli infection was associated with sanitation and hygiene in a household. Thus, education focused on food cooking and handling, child care, and household sanitation associated with animal manure in rural resident children are helpful in."
https://openalex.org/W3126061154,"Restoration of the Florida Everglades, a substantial wetland ecosystem within the United States, is one of the largest ongoing restoration projects in the world. Decision-makers and managers within the Everglades ecosystem rely on ecological models forecasting indicator wildlife response to changes in the management of water flows within the system. One such indicator of ecosystem health, the presence of wading bird communities on the landscape, is currently assessed using three species distribution models that assume perfect detection and report output on different scales that are challenging to compare against one another. We sought to use current advancements in species distribution modeling to improve models of Everglades wading bird distribution. Using a joint species distribution model that accounted for imperfect detection, we modeled the presence of nine species of wading bird simultaneously in response to annual hydrologic conditions and landscape characteristics within the Everglades system. Our resulting model improved upon the previous model in three key ways: 1) the model predicts probability of occupancy for the nine species on a scale of 0–1, making the output more intuitive and easily comparable for managers and decision-makers that must consider the responses of several species simultaneously; 2) through joint species modeling, we were able to consider rarer species within the modeling that otherwise are detected in too few numbers to fit as individual models; and 3) the model explicitly allows detection probability of species to be less than 1 which can reduce bias in the site occupancy estimates. These improvements are essential as Everglades restoration continues and managers require models that consider the impacts of water management on key indicator wildlife such as the wading bird community."

https://openalex.org/W3121947285,"Most physiological processes in mammals are subjected to daily oscillations that are governed by a circadian system. The circadian rhythm orchestrates metabolic pathways in a time-dependent manner and loss of circadian timekeeping has been associated with cellular and system-wide alterations in metabolism, redox homeostasis, and inflammation. Here, we investigated the expression of clock and clock-controlled genes in multiple tissues (suprachiasmatic nucleus, spinal cord, gastrocnemius muscle, and liver) from mutant hSOD1-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse models. We identified tissue-specific changes in the relative expression, as well as altered daily expression patterns, of clock genes, sirtuins (Sirt1, Sirt3, and Sirt6), metabolic enzymes (Pfkfb3, Cpt1, and Nampt), and redox regulators (Nrf2, G6pd, and Pgd). In addition, astrocytes transdifferentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells from SOD1-linked and FUS RNA binding protein-linked ALS patients also displayed altered expression of clock genes. Overall, our results raise the possibility of disrupted cross-talk between the suprachiasmatic nucleus and peripheral tissues in hSOD1G93A mice, preventing proper peripheral clock regulation and synchronization. Since these changes were observed in symptomatic mice, it remains unclear whether this dysregulation directly drives or it is a consequence of the degenerative process. However, because metabolism and redox homeostasis are intimately entangled with circadian rhythms, our data suggest that altered expression of clock genes may contribute to metabolic and redox impairment in ALS. Since circadian dyssynchrony can be rescued, these results provide the groundwork for potential disease-modifying interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3121208631,"The objectives of our study were to investigate the roles of mTORC1 in odontoblast proliferation and mineralization and to determine the mechanism by which mTORC1 regulates odontoblast mineralization. In vitro, MDPC23 cells were treated with rapamycin (10 nmol/L) and transfected with a lentivirus for short hairpin (shRNA)-mediated silencing of the tuberous sclerosis complex (shTSC1) to inhibit and activate mTORC1, respectively. CCK8 assays, flow cytometry, Alizarin red S staining, ALP staining, qRT-PCR, and western blot analysis were performed. TSC1-conditional knockout (DMP1-Cre+; TSC1f/f, hereafter CKO) mice and littermate control (DMP1-Cre−; TSC1f/f, hereafter WT) mice were generated. H&E staining, immunofluorescence, and micro-CT analysis were performed. Transcriptome sequencing analysis was used to screen the mechanism of this process. mTORC1 inactivation decreased the cell proliferation. The qRT-PCR and western blot results showed that mineralization-related genes and proteins were downregulated in mTORC1-inactivated cells. Moreover, mTORC1 overactivation promoted cell proliferation and mineralization-related gene and protein expression. In vivo, the micro-CT results showed that DV/TV and dentin thickness were higher in CKO mice than in controls and H&E staining showed the same results. Mineralization-related proteins expression was upregulated. Transcriptome sequencing analysis revealed that p53 pathway-associated genes were differentially expressed in TSC1-deficient cells. By inhibiting p53 alone or both mTORC1 and p53 with rapamycin and a p53 inhibitor, we elucidated that p53 acts downstream of mTORC1 and that mTORC1 thereby promotes odontoblast mineralization. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the role of mTORC1 in odontoblast proliferation and mineralization, and confirm that mTORC1 upregulates odontoblast mineralization via the p53 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3123682232,"Background Rabies remains endemic to the Harare Metropolitan Province of Zimbabwe, with a lack of public participations potentially contributing to the limited success in eliminating the disease. We hypothesized that rabies intervention campaigns were less successful than they could be as a result of poor understanding of the disease at the community level, and thus aimed to identify the knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards rabies in the province. Methods A cross-sectional survey, using a semi-structured questionnaire, was implemented between January 2017 and June 2018 across the province and data were collected from 798 respondents. Frequency distributions and logistic regressions were undertaken to determine the factors associated with the adequacy of the prevailing rabies knowledge, pet ownership characteristics and the existing preventative practices. Results The results of our study suggested that the majority of the respondents (92%) had heard of rabies. However, the level of rabies knowledge could be classified as “adequate” in only 36% of respondents. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that pet ownership and type of occupation were statistically associated with a better understanding and knowledge of the disease. Off all the respondents, 49% owned at least one dog or cat and suburb density and occupation were statistically associated with owning a pet. Amongst the pet owners, 57% consulted an animal health practitioner at least once a year and 75% were aware of a rabies vaccine for their pets. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that age, education and gender were statistically associated with pet owners taking their pet(s) to an animal clinic. Conclusion This study showed that the majority of the respondents lacked comprehensive knowledge about rabies, with the knowledge pertaining to health seeking behaviour and the importance of rabies vaccination being the most lacking. Additional public education relying on key messages, aimed at the different target audiences, is required in the province."
https://openalex.org/W3122865641,"Gammaherpesvirus infections are ubiquitous in captive and free-ranging ruminants and are associated with a variety of clinical diseases ranging from subclinical or mild inflammatory syndromes to fatal diseases such as malignant catarrhal fever. Gammaherpesvirus infections have been fully characterized in only a few ruminant species, and the overall diversity, host range, and biologic effects of most are not known. This study investigated the presence and host distribution of gammaherpesviruses in ruminant species at two facilities, the San Diego Zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park. We tested antemortem (blood, nasal or oropharyngeal swabs) or postmortem (internal organs) samples from 715 healthy or diseased ruminants representing 96 species and subspecies, using a consensus-based herpesvirus PCR for a segment of the DNA polymerase ( DPOL ) gene. Among the 715 animals tested, 161 (22.5%) were PCR and sequencing positive for herpesvirus, while only 11 (6.83%) of the PCR positive animals showed clinical signs of malignant catarrhal fever. Forty-four DPOL genotypes were identified of which only 10 have been reported in GenBank. The data describe viral diversity within species and individuals, identify host ranges of potential new viruses, and address the proclivity and consequences of interspecies transmission during management practices in zoological parks. The discovery of new viruses with wide host ranges and presence of co-infection within individual animals also suggest that the evolutionary processes influencing Gammaherpesvirus diversity are more complex than previously recognized."

Its unfolding mainly proceeds along the pathway of NC →UC ⇄ UT, whereas refolding follows the UT → IT (→NT) →NC pathway, in which N, I, and U are the native, intermediate, and unfolded states, respectively, with the Pro32 peptidyl-prolyl bond in cis or trans conformation as indicated by the subscript. It is noted that the IT state is a putative amyloidogenic precursor state. Several aggregation-prone variants of β2m have been reported to date. One of these variants is D76N β2m, which is a naturally occurring amyloidogenic mutant. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms contributing to the enhanced amyloidogenicity of the mutant, we investigated the equilibrium and kinetic transitions of pressure-induced folding/unfolding equilibria in the wild type and D76N mutant by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan and 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate fluorescence. An analysis of kinetic data revealed that the different folding/unfolding behaviors of the wild type and D76N mutant were due to differences in the activation energy between the unfolded and the intermediate states as well as stability of the native state, leading to more rapid accumulation of IT state for D76N in the refolding process. In addition, the IT state was found to assume more hydrophobic nature. These changes induced the enhanced amyloidogenicity of the D76N mutant and the distinct pathogenic symptoms of patients.

Although differences were noted in the number of states appearing in the folding pathway as well as rate constants between these states, a common feature was that the pathway assumed an annular scheme and was composed of fast and slow steps. The ends of the folding/unfolding reactions of β2m are the NC and UT states, where NC is the native state with Pro32 in the cis conformation (Fig. 1) and UT is the unfolded state with Pro32 in the trans conformation. Slow steps are associated with the cis-trans isomerization of the peptidyl-prolyl bond at Pro32. Due to slow cis-trans isomerization processes, the unfolding of β2m mainly proceeds along the NC → UC ⇄ UT pathway, whereas that of refolding follows the UT → IT (→NT) →NC pathway. It is important to note that the IT state, which mainly occurs in the refolding process, has been proposed as an amyloidogenic precursor state (10Chiti F. De Lorenzi E. Grossi S. Mangione P.

One of these variants is D76N β2m, which is a naturally occurring amyloidogenic mutant. D76N β2m was discovered in the members of a French family who had progressive bowel dysfunction with extensive visceral amyloid deposits composed of β2m (11Valleix S. Gillmore J.D. Bridoux F.

In contrast to patients with dialysis-related amyloidosis, all members of this family had normal circulating concentrations of β2m and none of the osteoarticular deposits characteristic of dialysis-related amyloidosis. Mangione et al. (12Mangione P.P. Esposito G. Relini A. Raimondi S. Porcari R. Giorgetti S. Corazza A. Fogolari F. Penco A. Goto Y. Lee Y.H. Yagi H. Cecconi C. Naqvi M.M.

In addition, wild-type β2m was recruited by the mutant into amyloid fibrils in vitro, but was absent from amyloid deposited in vivo (12Mangione P.P. Esposito G. Relini A. Raimondi S. Porcari R.

Although the mechanisms contributing to the enhanced amyloidogenicity of D76N have been investigated, they have not yet been elucidated in detail. Chong et al. (13Chong S.H. Hong J. Lim S. Cho S. Lee J. Ham S. Structural and thermodynamic characteristics of amyloidogenic intermediates of β-2-microglobulin.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5: 13631Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) performed a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the IT state to examine its structural properties. The findings obtained revealed the more hydrophobic nature of D76N than the wild type; however, the D76N IT state assumed a more compact, structured state. We also examined differences in the properties of the native states between wild-type and D76N β2ms using high-pressure NMR measurements and an MD simulation (14Sakurai K. Tomiyama R. Shiraki T. Yonezawa Y. Loosening of side-chain packing associated with perturbations in peripheral dynamics induced by the D76N mutation of β2-microglobulin revealed by pressure-NMR and molecular dynamic simulations.Biomolecules. 2019; 9: 491Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The findings obtained revealed that the peripheral region, including the C and D strands, of D76N was less flexible than that of the wild type. However, this consolidation induced the loosening of intersheet packing, leading to the destabilization of the native state and subsequent access to the amyloidogenic intermediate states. On the other hand, Smith et al. (15Smith H.I. Guthertz N. Cawood E.E. Maya-Martinez R. Breeze A.L. Radford S.E. The role of the IT-state in D76N β2-microglobulin amyloid assembly: A crucial intermediate or an innocuous bystander?.J. Biol.

They did not observe any significant differences in structural features or the kinetics of the formation and deformation of the IT state between the wild type and D76N. These findings indicated that the amyloidogenic process of D76N is distinct from that of the wild type. In the present study, we investigated the pressure-induced unfolding of wild-type and D76N β2ms in order to elucidate the molecular properties of each state appearing in the folding process, particularly the amyloidogenic intermediate state. Previous studies investigated the effects of pressure on protein conformations and stabilities. Among the various denaturing perturbations, such as the denaturant, temperature, and pH, analyses of pressure-induced denaturation behavior provided us with unique information on protein molecules, e.g., molar volume changes and thermal fluctuations (16Akasaka K. Probing conformational fluctuation of proteins by pressure perturbation.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1814-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 17Kitahara R. Hata K. Li H. Williamson M.P. Akasaka K. Pressure-induced chemical shifts as probes for conformational fluctuations in proteins.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2013; 71: 35-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The results of our equilibrium unfolding experiment suggested that D76N unfolded at a lower pressure region than the wild type, as expected. Regarding folding kinetics, wild-type β2m showed a “roll-over”, i.e., an increased refolding rate with pressure increases in the lower pressure range (less than 100 MPa), indicating the presence of transition states with a lower molecular volume than the preceding state. The results obtained were reasonably interpreted using a four-state folding model. The results of model fitting for the wild type revealed that conformational changes from the intermediate states to the native state underwent a transient volumetric reduction, indicating that the intermediate state had to unfold once and reassemble residue–residue interactions in order to acquire its native conformation. Furthermore, the IT state of D76N showed enhanced hydrophobicity and accumulated more rapidly than the wild type in the folding process. Based on these results, we discussed the enhanced amyloidogenicity of the D76N mutant. The native state under physiological conditions was too stable to accomplish any pressure-induced unfolding within the accessible pressure range. Therefore, prior to the experiment for the pressure effect, we selected pH conditions under which the native conformation was slightly destabilized. Fig. S1A shows pH-dependent spectral changes in the wild type, which has already been published in our previous report (14Sakurai K. Tomiyama R. Shiraki T. Yonezawa Y. Loosening of side-chain packing associated with perturbations in peripheral dynamics induced by the D76N mutation of β2-microglobulin revealed by pressure-NMR and molecular dynamic simulations.Biomolecules. 2019; 9: 491Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). As we mentioned therein, the spectral peak was red-shifted with a simultaneous reduction in intensity when pH was decreased. Fig. S1B shows the pH-dependent <ν> values for wild-type β2m and D76N, where <ν> is center of spectral mass and indicates the averaged wavelength of the fluorescence spectrum (see Equation 3 in Experimental procedures). The wild type and D76N showed clear cooperative transitions (Fig. S1B, the red and green markers). We fit the data with sigmoidal curves to obtain the mid-point pH values of unfolding (pHm). The pHm values obtained were 4.11 ± 0.04 and 4.54 ± 0.03 for the wild type and D76N, respectively. Based on these experiments, both the wild type and D76N assumed the native state at pH 6.0. Thus, in subsequent experiments, we prepared the sample solution at this pH. Figure 2A shows the pressure dependence of the tryptophan fluorescence spectra of wild-type β2m at pH 6.0. These spectra were recorded 30 min after pressure was increased to the respective pressure points. Figure 2B shows the pressure dependence of the fraction of the native state based on the <ν> values for wild-type and D76N β2ms. Both species showed clear cooperative transitions. If there are only two states, namely the native (N) and unfolded (U) states, the free energy difference between these two state at respective pressure point (ΔGNU) is described by the following equation (16Akasaka K. Probing conformational fluctuation of proteins by pressure perturbation.Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1814-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar):ΔGND=ΔG0,ND+PΔVND(1) where P is applied pressure, ΔG0,NU is ΔGNU at ambient pressure, and ΔVNU is difference in molar volume between the N and U states. By assuming a simple two-state model, we fitted the fraction of the N state (fN) data for ΔG0,NU and ΔVNU using the following equation:fN=1/(1+exp(−ΔG0,ND+PΔVNDRT))(2) The apparent values obtained were ΔG0,NU = −22.5 ± 1.1 kJ/mol and ΔVNU = 74.5 ± 3.6 ml/mol for the wild type and ΔG0,NU = −12.0 ± 1.0 kJ/mol and ΔVNU = 56.0 ± 4.6 ml/mol for D76N. It is noted that the obtained ΔG0 values agree very well with those reported by Mangione et al. (12Mangione P.P. Esposito G. Relini A. Raimondi S. Porcari R. Giorgetti S. Corazza A. Fogolari F.

We then measured unfolding kinetics. Immediately after the pressure had been increased to the desired point, repetitive measurements of spectra were initiated. The <ν> values of each spectrum were plotted against time (Fig. 2, C and D) and fit to a single exponential curve for rate constants. The rate constants obtained were plotted against the measurement pressure (Fig. 2E). According to previous findings, the time constants of the fast and slow phases were 0.1∼0.2 s and ∼800 s, respectively (8Sakata M. Chatani E. Kameda A. Sakurai K. Naiki H. Goto Y.

Since the dead time of the present measurements was approximately ∼180 s, the present measurements only detected the slow phases. The unfolding rate constants for wild-type and D76N β2ms increased with pressure; however, the plot of the mutant shifted to a lower pressure range than that of the wild type (Fig. 2E). Since the kinetic events observed were relatively slow, they were assumed to correspond to cis to trans isomerization reactions on the peptidyl–prolyl bond at Pro32 (8Sakata M. Chatani E. Kameda A.

In order to check this assumption, we also investigated the unfolding kinetics of ΔN6 and P32V β2ms, both of which are known to have the trans form of Pro32 in their native states and do not show a cis-trans conformational transition. As expected, these variants did not have a kinetic phase (Fig. S2), confirming that the slow kinetic phases observed in these unfolding experiments were caused by the cis to trans isomerization of Pro32. We also attempted to investigate refolding kinetics by monitoring time-dependent <ν>; however, apparent kinetics were found to be accomplished within several minutes (Fig. S3) possibly because the fast phase accompanies the shift in <ν>, while the slow phase did not show significant changes in <ν>. Thus, instead of <ν>, we examined 1-anillino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) fluorescence. Figure 3A shows the spectra of the native state (black) and pressure-induced unfolded state (blue) of the wild type, indicating that the unfolded state induced the enhancement in ANS fluorescence, particularly at 460 nm. When ANS fluorescence at this wavelength was used to probe refolding kinetics, we found that it was able to monitor the refolding kinetics of the slow steps (Fig. 3, B and C). Observations of refolding kinetics from the pressure-induced unfolded state were started immediately after the release of pressure to the respective pressure points. The fluorescence intensities obtained were normalized with respect to the initial (unfolded state) intensity of the ANS fluorescence (Fig. 3, B and C). The intensity of ANS fluorescence immediately after the pressure release for D76N was larger than that of the wild type (Fig. 3C), indicating that the burst-phase species of D76N has a more hydrophobic nature. Kinetic data were then fit with a single exponential curve to obtain rate constants. Figure 3D shows the pressure-dependent rate constants for wild-type and D76N β2ms. It is noted that rate constants of ANS association and dissociation were reported to be 101∼102 s−1 (18Cattoni D.I. Kaufman S.B. Gonzalez Flecha F.L.

Therefore, the observed rate constant, which was smaller than those of the association/dissociation rates by four order of magnitude, likely reflected the conformational change of β2ms. The pattern of the pressure-dependent rate constants of D76N shifted toward a lower pressure range than that of the wild type, similar to unfolding kinetics. At the lower pressure region, a “roll-over” was noted, namely refolding kinetics became faster as pressure increased. This result indicated that transition state(s) appearing during the folding pathway had a lower molar volume than the preceding state (see Equation 5). We performed a fitting analysis with the kinetic data of pressure-induced unfolding and refolding experiments. Based on previous reports (8Sakata M. Chatani E. Kameda A. Sakurai K. Naiki H. Goto Y.

The G0 and V values for the UT state were set to be 0 as the reference state. Then, we assumed the ΔG0 and ΔV values for other stable states (UC, IT, and NC) as the differences between respective states and the UT state. The ΔG0 and ΔV values for transition states between these four states (‡UT-UC, ‡UC-NC, ‡UT-IT, and ‡IT-NC) with respect to the UT state were also introduced. In addition, normalized values of <ν> and intensity of ANS fluorescence (IANS) for individual species were introduced as fitting parameters. Thus, there were 22 thermodynamic parameters (the ΔG0 and ΔV values for the UT state were set to be 0 as the reference state as indicated by a in Table 1). The equilibrium and kinetic data were globally fitted to the theoretical curves with the fitting parameters (see Experimental procedures). However, since the number of the fitting parameters were too many and the kinetic data obtained in the present study were limited to “slow phases” according to previous studies, all of the parameters cannot be unambiguously identified. Thus, we introduced a couple of assumptions for this fitting. (i) The cis-trans kinetics in unfolded states (UT-UC) were fixed and invariable with respect to pressure (assuming that ΔV of UT, UC, and ‡UT-UC are 0). Fixed values following by (i) are indicated by b in Table 1. (ii) During the fitting analysis, normalized IANS for individual species was set variable, whereas normalized <ν> was fixed to 0 for UC and UT and to 1 for IT and NC. ΔG0 and ΔV values between the UT and NC states were based on those obtained in the equilibrium experiments performed above. Under these assumptions, experimental data displayed in Figures 4, B–D were simultaneously subjected to the global fitting. These data were successfully fitted with the parameters listed in Table 1. It is noted that, although the data in Figure 4B is basically the same as those in Figure 2B, the theoretical curve was that derived from the global fitting results. Figure 4, E and F show graphical representation of ΔG0 diagram at the ambient pressure and ΔV diagrams in a reaction coordinate form based on the parameters listed in Table 1, respectively. The ΔG diagrams at respective pressures were also calculated and displayed in Fig. S4. The time courses of the populations of these states upon refolding at the ambient pressure (Fig. 4, G and H) and at 100 MPa (Fig. 4, I and J) were also calculated. The refolding/unfolding time courses at respective pressures are also displayed in Fig. S4.

As the cis-trans isomerization of the Pro32 is slow, the observed slow kinetics is derived from the second step (IT →NC). Although there are no direct data of the fast phases, we found that the kinetic rates of the first and second steps of the UT → IT →NC pathway were mutually dependent, and we were able to draw information about both phases from the observed slow phase (Fig. 5): Our analytical results told us that the rate-limiting steps was the second step (IT →NC) at lower pressures (Figs. 4, G and H and 5A, and Fig. S4, A–C), whereas it changed to the first step (UT → IT"
https://openalex.org/W3123713096,"During reading or listening, people can generate predictions about the lexical and morphosyntactic properties of upcoming input based on available context. Psycholinguistic experiments that study predictability or control for it conventionally rely on a human-based approach and estimate predictability via the cloze task. Our study investigated an alternative corpus-based approach for estimating predictability via language predictability models. We obtained cloze and corpus-based probabilities for all words in 144 Russian sentences, correlated the two measures, and found a strong correlation between them. Importantly, we estimated how much variance in eye movements registered while reading the same sentences was explained by each of the two probabilities and whether the two probabilities explain the same variance. Along with lexical predictability (the activation of a particular word form), we analyzed morphosyntactic predictability (the activation of morphological features of words) and its effect on reading times over and above lexical predictability. We found that for predicting reading times, cloze and corpus-based measures of both lexical and morphosyntactic predictability explained the same amount of variance. However, cloze and corpus-based lexical probabilities both independently contributed to a better model fit, whereas for morphosyntactic probabilities, the contributions of cloze and corpus-based measures were interchangeable. Therefore, morphosyntactic but not lexical corpus-based probabilities can substitute for cloze probabilities in reading experiments. Our results also indicate that in languages with rich inflectional morphology, such as Russian, when people engage in prediction, they are much more successful in predicting isolated morphosyntactic features than predicting the particular lexeme and its full morphosyntactic markup."
https://openalex.org/W3124125018,"Light microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests are the two commonly used methods for malaria diagnosis that rely on the direct use of unprocessed blood samples. However, both methods do not have the level of sensitivity required for malaria diagnosis in cases of low density parasitaemia. We report here the diagnostic performance of a whole blood-based reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification method for Plasmodium falciparum malaria diagnosis in apparently healthy blood donors and febrile neonates in Cameroon. The presence of malaria parasites in whole blood samples was determined by light microscopy, antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and by RT-LAMP using a “lyse and amplify” experimental protocol. Of the 256 blood donors tested, 36 (14.1%) were positive for malaria parasites by light microscopy, 38 (14.8%) were positive by RDT whereas 78 (30.5%) were positive by RT-LAMP. Only light microscopy and RT-LAMP detected infection among the febrile neonates (279 neonates, median age: 2 days, range: 1–9 days), with positivity rates of 8.6% and 12.2%, respectively. The overall concordance between the three methods were 75.9% for RT-LAMP and light microscopy, 75.1% for RT-LAMP and RDT, and 83.9% for light microscopy and RDT. Blood parasite densities were significantly lower in the neonates (mean: 97.6, range: 61–192 parasites/μL) compared to the blood donors (mean: 447.8, range: 63–11 000 parasites/μL). Together, the study demonstrates the usefulness of whole blood RT-LAMP for use in rapid pre-screening of blood donors and suspected neonates to avert severe consequences of P . falciparum infections."
https://openalex.org/W3123670806,"The main cause of rainfall-induced red-bed shallow landslides is the tendency of red-bed weathered soil to expand when it meets water. However, studies on the expansion mechanism of expansive soil have not considered the effects of hydration and particle orientation. In this study, the hydration force of soil was determined according to the electric double-layer theory, the particle direction of soil was determined by analyzing images of soil obtained by scanning electron microscopy, and, finally, a microscopic model of the electrical double layer of red-bed weathered expansive soil was established in which the hydration force and soil-particle orientation were taken into account. The results showed that the expansion of red-bed weathered expansive soil is the result of hydration forces and repulsive forces in the electric double layer. The grain orientation of the soil strongly influenced the microscopic model. The unloading expansion rate of red-bed weathered expansive soil decreased with an increase in cation concentration and a decrease in pH value. It increased with an increase in the hydration cation radius. These experiments indicate the reliability of the microscopic model and provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of rainfall-induced red-bed shallow landslides."

We currently know little about the characteristics of this seronegative response. The aim of this study was to explore the factors associated with serological cure after treatment of early syphilis. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted and the data of patients with early syphilis in a clinic in Shenzhen from 2011 to 2019 were retrieved. Univariable and multiple Cox proportional hazard regression models were utilized to identify factors associated with a serological cure state among syphilis patients with early syphilis two years after treatment. Results A total of 346 (85.9%) syphilis patients achieved serological cure. The multivariate analysis results revealed that having a baseline TRUST titer &gt;1:8 was associated with an increased probability of serological cure, compared with having a baseline TRUST titer ≤1:8 (HR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.10–1.85, P&lt;0.01); primary syphilis was positively associated with serological cure, compared with participants with latent early syphilis (HR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.27–2.33, P&lt;0.001). Conclusions Two years after treatment, a higher percentage of early syphilis patients achieved serological cure. The study indicated that the syphilis stage and baseline serum titer were crucial factors associated with serological cure."

To understand the genes determining chapatti quality, differentially expressed genes were selected from microarray data of contrasting chapatti cultivars. From the gene and trait association studies, a null allele of granule bound starch synthase (GBSS; Wx-B1 ) was found to be associated with low amylose content and good chapatti quality. For validation, near-isogenic lines (NILs) of this allele were created by marker assisted backcross (MAB) breeding. Background screening indicated 88.2 to 96.7% background recovery in 16 selected BC 3 F 5 NILs. Processing quality and sensory evaluation of selected NILs indicated improvement in chapatti making quality. Traits that showed improvement were mouthfeel, tearing strength and softness indicating that the Wx-B1 may be one of the major genes controlling chapatti softness."
https://openalex.org/W3125335536,"The eukaryotic kinase domain has multiple intrinsically disordered regions whose conformation dictates kinase activity. Small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) rely on disrupting the active conformations of these disordered regions to inactivate the kinase. While SMKIs are selected for their ability to cause this disruption, the allosteric effects of conformational changes in disordered regions is limited by a lack of dynamic information provided by traditional structural techniques. In this study, we integrated multiscale molecular dynamics simulations with FRET sensors to characterize a novel allosteric mechanism that is selectively triggered by SMKI binding to the protein kinase Cα domain. The indole maleimide inhibitors BimI and sotrastaurin were found to displace the Gly-rich loop (G-loop) that normally shields the ATP-binding site. Displacement of the G-loop interferes with a newly identified, structurally conserved binding pocket for the C1a domain on the N lobe of the kinase domain. This binding pocket, in conjunction with the N-terminal regulatory sequence, masks a diacylglycerol (DAG) binding site on the C1a domain. SMKI-mediated displacement of the G-loop released C1a and exposed the DAG binding site, enhancing protein kinase Cα translocation both to synthetic lipid bilayers and to live cell membranes in the presence of DAG. Inhibitor chemotype determined the extent of the observed allosteric effects on the kinase domain and correlated with the extent of membrane recruitment. Our findings demonstrate the allosteric effects of SMKIs beyond the confines of kinase catalytic conformation and provide an integrated computational-experimental paradigm to investigate parallel mechanisms in other kinases."
