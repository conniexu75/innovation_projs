Like many proteins involved in the DNA damage response, 53BP1 becomes hyperphosphorylated after radiation and colocalizes with phosphorylated H2AX in megabase regions surrounding the sites of DNA strand breaks. However, it is not yet clear whether the phosphorylation status of 53BP1 determines its localization or vice versa. In this study we mapped a region upstream of the 53BP1 C terminus that is required and sufficient for the recruitment of 53BP1 to these DNA break areas. In vitro assays revealed that this region binds to phosphorylated but not unphosphorylated H2AX. Moreover, using H2AX-deficient cells reconstituted with wild-type or a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of H2AX, we have shown that phosphorylation of H2AX at serine 140 is critical for efficient 53BP1 foci formation, implying that a direct interaction between 53BP1 and phosphorylated H2AX is required for the accumulation of 53BP1 at DNA break sites. On the other hand, radiation-induced phosphorylation of the 53BP1 N terminus by the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) kinase is not essential for 53BP1 foci formation and takes place independently of 53BP1 redistribution. Thus, these two damage-induced events, hyperphosphorylation and relocalization of 53BP1, occur independently in the cell. 53BP1 participates in the cellular response to DNA damage.

Thus, these two damage-induced events, hyperphosphorylation and relocalization of 53BP1, occur independently in the cell. The DNA of eukaryotic cells is constantly exposed to endogenous and exogenous DNA-damaging agents. To prevent the accumulation of genomic damage and avert cellular dysfunction, cells have evolved complex response mechanisms. 53BP1 was initially identified as a protein that binds to the central DNA binding domain of p53 and enhances p53-mediated transcriptional activation (1Iwabuchi K.

In response to genotoxic stress, 53BP1 rapidly redistributes from a diffuse nuclear localization into distinct nuclear foci suggesting that 53BP1 is involved in the DNA damage response (3Rappold I.

Moreover the C terminus of 53BP1 contains two BRCT domains, a motif found in a number of proteins implicated in various aspects of cell cycle control, recombination, and DNA repair (7Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 8Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that 53BP1 becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to ionizing radiation (IR) 1The abbreviations used are: IR, ionizing radiation; γ-H2AX, phosphorylated histone H2AX; ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; HA, hemagglutinin; ES, embryonic stem; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; Gy, gray(s); GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acid(s); IF, immunofluorescence; BRCT, BRCA1 C terminus. and colocalizes with phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) at the sites of DNA lesions (3Rappold I.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Other proteins known to be involved in the DNA damage signaling pathway (i.e. BRCA1, Rad51, NBS1, and TopoBP1) were also found to colocalize with 53BP1 in these inducible foci (3Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 4Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. J.

Direct evidence for an important role of 53BP1 in the DNA damage response came recently from studies using 53BP1-deficient cells. Human cell lines treated with specific small interfering RNA to silence 53BP1 expression exhibited a defect in the intra-S phase checkpoint and, at low IR doses, a partial defect in the G2-M checkpoint (10DiTullio R.A.

Moreover 53BP1-deficient mice are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and show an increased incidence of developing thymic lymphomas (13Ward I.M. Minn K. Van Deursen J. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that 53BP1 is a substrate of ATM, the kinase mutated in the human disease ataxia-telangiectasia, and is involved in the phosphorylation of various ATM substrates (3Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 6Anderson L. Henderson C. Adachi Y. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Despite this recent progress made toward 53BP1 function little is known about the initial activation of 53BP1. Recruitment of 53BP1 to γ-H2AX foci seems to be a crucial step. H2AX-deficient cells lack normal 53BP1 foci formation and, like 53BP1-deficent cells, manifest a G2-M checkpoint defect after exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (12Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I. Romanienko P.J. Morales J.C. Naka K. Xia Z. Camerini-Otero R.D. Motoyama N. Carpenter P.B. Bonner W.M. Chen J. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Moreover, H2AX–/– mice show a radiation sensitivity similar to 53BP1–/– mice (14Celeste A. Petersen S. Romanienko P.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Sedelnikova O.A. Reina-San-Martin B. Coppola V. Meffre E. Difilippantonio M.J. Redon C. Pilch D.R. Olaru A. Eckhaus M. Camerini-Otero R.D. Tessarollo L. Livak F. Manova K. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Science. 2002; 296: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). In this study we mapped the region required for 53BP1 foci formation in response to DNA damage. We show that a region upstream of the BRCT motifs is sufficient for 53BP1 foci formation and that this region interacts directly with phosphorylated H2AX. Using H2AX-deficient cells retransfected with either wild-type H2AX or an H2AX phosphomutant we confirm that phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser-140 is required for 53BP1 accumulation at DNA break areas. In contrast, radiation-induced phosphorylation of 53BP1 by ATM is not essential for the recruitment of 53BP1 to foci and occurs independently. Plasmid Constructs and Transfection—53BP1 deletion mutants were generated by inserting stop codons and/or restriction sites at various positions into pCMH6K 53BP1 (2Iwabuchi K. Li B. Massa H.F. Trask B.J. Date T. Fields S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26061-26068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A 3×NLS (nuclear localization sequence) was inserted into the NheI site upstream of the N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) and His6 tags. U2OS cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. H2AX was PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA and inserted between the HA tag and an internal ribosomal entry site fused to the puromycin gene of a modified pcDNA3 vector. The H2AX phosphomutant was generated by replacing Ser-140 of H2AX with an alanine using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). H2AX-deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells (provided by C. Bassing, Ref. 15Bassing C.H. Chua K.F. Sekiguchi J. Suh H. Whitlow S.R. Fleming J.C. Monroe B.C. Ciccone D.N. Yan C. Vlasakova K. Livingston D.M. Ferguson D.O. Scully R. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8173-8178Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) were transfected by electroporation. Antibodies—Anti-S6P, anti-S25P/29P, and anti-S784P specific antibodies were generated by coupling synthetic 53BP1 peptides (S6P, CDPTG(P)SQLD; S25P/29P, CIED(P)SQPE(P)SQVLEDD; S784P, CSD(P)SQSWEDI where (P)S represents phosphoserine) to KLH using Imject maleimide-activated mcKLH (Pierce) prior to immunizing rabbits (Cocalico Biological). The antibodies were affinity-purified on agarose columns coupled with the non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated peptide (SulfoLink Coupling Gel, Pierce). Anti-53BP1 and anti-γ-H2AX antibodies were generated as described previously (3Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody HA11 specific for HA was purchased from BabCO Berkeley Antibody Co. Anti-ATM antibody Ab3 was purchased from Oncogene Research Products. Immunofluorescence Staining, Immunoblots, and Immunoprecipitation—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde 1 h after exposure to 0 or 1 Gy of IR. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100, cells were blocked with 5% goat serum and incubated successively with the primary and secondary antibodies, each for 25 min at 37 °C. In case of DNase or RNase treatment, cells were irradiated, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 3 min, and incubated with either DNase I (10 units/ml) or RNase A (50 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline plus calcium and magnesium for 30 min at 37 °C prior to fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays were done as described previously (3Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). ATM Kinase Assays—ATM was precipitated from K562 cells, and aliquots of the ATM-protein A-Sepharose immunocomplex were resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 nm ATP). ATM kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 20 min with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of 53BP1 GST fusion proteins. GST Pull-down Assays—GST pull-down experiments were performed by incubating 3 μg of various GST-labeled 53BP1 fragments with C-terminal H2AX peptide that was either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated at Ser-140 (CKATQA(P)SQEY) and had been immobilized on SulfoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce). Bound GST proteins were isolated by incubating the mixture for 1 h at 4 °C in 200 μl of NETN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 0.5% Nonidet P-40), washing five times with NETN, eluting the proteins with 2× Laemmli buffer, separating them by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-GST (B-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Generation of 53BP1-deficient Embryonic Cells—A 53BP1-deficient embryonic cell line was derived from 53BP1–/– blastocysts using a standard procedure. The generation of 53BP1-deficient mice is described in Ref. 13Ward I.M. Minn K. Van Deursen J. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2556-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar. A Region Upstream of the Tandem BRCT Motif Is Required and Sufficient for 53BP1 Foci Formation—53BP1 is a large 1972-aa nuclear protein with a C-terminal tandem BRCT motif. Upstream of the BRCT repeats resides a bipartite nuclear localization signal (predictNLS, Ref. 16Cokol M. Nair R. Rost B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and a tudor domain (RPS-BLAST, Ref. 17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60532) Google Scholar), a motif found in several RNA-binding proteins. In response to IR, 53BP1 rapidly redistributes to distinct nuclear foci that colocalize with γ-H2AX (3Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 4Schultz L.B. Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Halazonetis T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 6Anderson L. Henderson C. Adachi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1719-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Treatment of irradiated cells with DNase, but not RNase, completely abolished 53BP1 and γ-H2AX foci formation confirming that these foci localize to DNA (Fig. 1A). To determine the minimal region required for the recruitment of 53BP1 to damage-induced foci, we generated various HA-tagged 53BP1 deletion mutants and examined their distribution in transiently transfected U2OS cells (Fig. 1, B and C, and data not shown). A 3×NLS motif fused to the N terminus of 53BP1 ensured nuclear expression of the various constructs. Truncation of the 53BP1 N terminus (Δ1–1052) or the BRCT domains (Δ1700–1972) did not affect 53BP1 foci formation as assessed by IF 1 h after exposure to 1 Gy of IR (Fig. 1C). However, increasing C-terminal deletions (Δ1305–1972 and Δ1052–1972) or deletion of a region upstream of the tandem BRCT motifs (Δ1052–1305) abolished 53BP1 foci formation (Fig. 2, B and C, and data not shown). Moreover a 53BP1 construct expressing residues 1052–1639 including the tudor domain was found to be sufficient for 53BP1 foci formation (Fig. 1, B and C) suggesting that the domain required for foci formation is contained within this region. 53BP1 Focus Localization Region Interacts Directly with γ-H2AX—H2AX-deficient cells show greatly reduced 53BP1 foci formation implying that H2AX is involved in the recruitment of 53BP1 to radiation-induced foci (14Celeste A. Petersen S. Romanienko P.J. Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Sedelnikova O.A. Reina-San-Martin B. Coppola V. Meffre E. Difilippantonio M.J. Redon C. Pilch D.R. Olaru A. Eckhaus M. Camerini-Otero R.D. Tessarollo L. Livak F. Manova K. Bonner W.M. Nussenzweig M.C. Nussenzweig A. Science. 2002; 296: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). H2AX becomes phosphorylated at a conserved C-terminal SQ site upon exposure of cells to ionizing radiation (18Rogakou E.P. Pilch D.R. Orr A.H. Ivanova V.S. Bonner W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5858-5868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4236) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser-140 is impaired in ATM-deficient cells suggesting that this site is dominantly phosphorylated by ATM (12Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I. Romanienko P.J. Morales J.C. Naka K. Xia Z. Camerini-Otero R.D. Motoyama N. Carpenter P.B. Bonner W.M. Chen J. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). To analyze whether phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser-140 is required for 53BP1 redistribution we transiently expressed wild-type H2AX or a S140A phosphomutant in H2AX-deficient ES cells and assessed 53BP1 foci formation. As shown in Fig. 2A, expression of wild-type H2AX reconstituted 53BP1 foci formation in response to IR. In marked contrast, expression of the H2AX S140A phosphomutant was insufficient to induce 53BP1 accumulation at the sites of DNA strand breaks. We had shown earlier that phosphorylated H2AX co-immunoprecipitates with 53BP1 upon exposure of cells to DNA damage (3Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). To determine whether the region required for 53BP1 focus localization interacts directly with γ-H2AX, we used an in vitro pull-down assay. Six different 53BP1 GST fragments spanning the entire 53BP1 protein were incubated with immobilized C-terminal H2AX peptide that was either phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated at Ser-140. Only 53BP1 fragment 956–1354, which overlaps with the mapped focus localization region, showed strong interaction with the phosphorylated H2AX peptide (Fig. 2B). As a control, no binding was detected to the non-phosphorylated peptide bearing identical sequence (Fig. 2B). Since H2AX directs 53BP1 accumulation in response to DNA damage, we asked whether H2AX is also required for the kinetochore localization of 53BP1 in mitotic cells (19Jullien D. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Adachi Y. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 71-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, 53BP1 can be readily detected at the kinetochores in H2AX-deficient mitotic cells suggesting that the kinetochore localization of 53BP1 is not mediated by phospho-H2AX. Phosphorylation of 53BP1 Is Not Required for Foci Formation—We had previously demonstrated that 53BP1 becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to IR, and three regions at the N terminus of 53BP1 were found to be phosphorylated by ATM in vitro (3Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). To map the phosphorylation sites we designed a series of GST fusion peptides containing one or two ATM binding motifs (SQ or TQ sites). ATM kinase assays using these purified GST fusion proteins as substrates, and ATM kinase immunoprecipitated from either K562 lysates (containing wild-type ATM) or ATM-deficient GM03189D lysates revealed peptides aa 1–12, aa 18–37, and aa 778–791 as putative ATM substrates (Fig. 3A). To examine whether the respective SQ sites become phosphorylated in vivo, we raised polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated Ser-6 (anti-S6P), phosphorylated Ser-25 and Ser-29 (anti-S25P/29P), and phosphorylated Ser-784 (anti-S784P). All affinity-purified antisera recognized 53BP1 in irradiated cells but not in untreated controls when assessed by immunofluorescence analysis (data not shown). In addition, anti-53BP1 S25P/29P antibodies detected 53BP1 from irradiated ATM wild-type but not ATM-deficient cells by Western blot analyses (Fig. 3B). Pretreatment with λ-phosphatase abolished the antibody binding further validating that anti-53BP1 S25P/29P specifically recognizes the phosphorylated form of 53BP1 (Fig. 3B). To test whether phosphorylation of 53BP1 is required for the recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DNA lesions, we generated a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (53BP1 4SA) by mutating the mapped ATM target sites (Ser-6, Ser-25/Ser-29, and Ser-784) to alanines. 53BP1–/– embryonic cells transfected with this phosphomutant showed normal 53BP1 foci formation in response to IR (Fig. 3C), indicating that ATM-dependent phosphorylation of 53BP1 is not required for recruitment to or retention of 53BP1 at DNA break sites. Phosphorylation of 53BP1 might occur at the break areas. To test this possibility, we transiently transfected 53BP1-deficient embryonic cells with the HA-tagged mutant that lacks part of the 53BP1 focus localization region (Δ1052–1305) and remains a diffuse nuclear localization upon exposure of cells to IR. Co-immunostaining with anti-HA and anti-53BP1 S25P/29P antibodies revealed that ATM-dependent 53BP1 phosphorylation does not require 53BP1 foci formation (Fig. 3D). Immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that 53BP1 Δ1052–1305 becomes readily phosphorylated at Ser-25/Ser-29 in response to IR (Fig. 3E). These findings are consistent with a recent report describing phosphorylation of 53BP1 Ser-25 in H2AX-deficient cells (12Fernandez-Capetillo O. Chen H.T. Celeste A. Ward I. Romanienko P.J. Morales J.C. Naka K. Xia Z. Camerini-Otero R.D. Motoyama N. Carpenter P.B. Bonner W.M. Chen J. Nussenzweig A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that 53BP1 focus localization and ATM-dependent phosphorylation of 53BP1 are regulated independently. Upon exposure of cells to genotoxic stress, 53BP1 rapidly redistributes from a pan-nuclear localization to distinct nuclear foci at the sites of DNA strand breaks. In this study we have mapped the region required for 53BP1 foci formation and examined the role of H2AX in 53BP1 accumulation. Moreover, we provided evidence that phosphorylation of 53BP1 by the ATM kinase occurs independently of 53BP1 foci formation. 53BP1 had been speculated to be involved in the DNA damage response based on its C-terminal tandem BRCT domains. This motif was first detected in the BRCA1 C terminus and has been reported to bind directly to DNA breaks (20Yamane K. Katayama E. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 678-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Surprisingly the BRCT domains of 53BP1 were found to be dispensable for 53BP1 foci formation. Instead a region upstream of the BRCT motifs proved to be essential for 53BP1 accumulation at sites of DNA strand breaks. Our data suggest that the damage-induced phosphorylation of H2AX directs 53BP1 accumulation at sites of DNA strand breaks. First, H2AX-deficient cells reconstituted with a H2AX phosphomutant failed to induce or sustain 53BP1 foci formation. Second, a 53BP1 fragment (residues 956–1354) contained within the 53BP1 focus localization region interacted strongly with phosphorylated H2AX in vitro. Third, 53BP1 co-immunoprecipitates with H2AX in a DNA damage-dependent manner (3Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser-140 increases the interaction between H2AX and 53BP1 and leads to the accumulation of 53BP1 at the sites of DNA breaks. Interestingly the focus localization region we mapped includes a region required for 53BP1 kinetochore localization in mitotic cells (residues 1220–1601) (19Jullien D. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Adachi Y. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 71-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Very recently, Morales and colleagues (21Morales J.C. Xia Z. Lu T. Aldrich M.B. Wang B. Rosales C. Kellems R.E. Hittelman W.N. Elledge S.J. Carpenter P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14971-14977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showed that the kinetochore localization region is also essential for 53BP1 foci formation in response to DNA damage suggesting that both events might be regulated in a similar fashion. However, the kinetochore localization of 53BP1 is unlikely to involve DNA lesions (19Jullien D. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Adachi Y. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 71-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that 53BP1 kinetochore localization appears normal in H2AX-deficient cells, suggesting that kinetochore localization of 53BP1 is not mediated by phospho-H2AX. Further fine mapping studies will be necessary to clarify whether the same 53BP1 region initiates the recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA strand breaks or the kinetochore, respectively. Phosphorylation by the ATM kinase plays a key role in the activation of various proteins involved in the DNA damage response (for example, see Ref. 22Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). A recent study by Bakkenist and Kastan (23Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2725) Google Scholar) revealed that ATM forms an inactive oligomer in unirradiated cells. Upon radiation, ATM is rapidly autophosphorylated and dissociates from the complex thereby providing other substrates access to its kinase domain. Interestingly autophoshorylation and activation of ATM seem to occur at some distance to DNA break sites, and ATM then migrates in the nucleus to phosphorylate various substrates either at the break sites or elsewhere in the nucleus (23Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2725) Google Scholar). This model is consistent with our finding that ATM-dependent phosphorylation of 53BP1 is not restricted to sites of DNA strand breaks and can occur within the entire nucleus. However, phosphorylation of 53BP1 alone is unlikely to trigger 53BP1 activation since deletion of the ATM target sites does not affect 53BP1 relocalization. Moreover the relocalization of 53BP1 appears to be required for efficient phosphorylation of ATM substrates at the sites of DNA breaks (data not shown). We therefore speculate that the rapid recruitment of 53BP1 to DNA break sites and the retention of 53BP1 at the sites of DNA breaks by binding to phospho-H2AX is one of the key steps in the activation of 53BP1 following DNA damage.

https://openalex.org/W1983773316,"A mouse model with liver-specific deletion of the NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (Cpr) gene (designated Alb-Cre/Cprlox mice) was generated and characterized in this study. Hepatic microsomal CPR expression was significantly reduced at 3 weeks and was barely detectable at 2 months of age in the Alb-Cre+/–/Cprlox+/+ (homozygous) mice, with corresponding decreases in liver microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) and heme oxygenase (HO) activities, in pentobarbital clearance, and in total plasma cholesterol level. Nevertheless, the homozygous mice are fertile and are normal in gross appearance and growth rate. However, at 2 months, although not at 3 weeks, the homozygotes had significant increases in liver weight, accompanied by hepatic lipidosis and other pathologic changes. Intriguingly, total microsomal CYP content was increased in the homozygotes about 2-fold at 3 weeks and about 3-fold at 2 months of age; at 2 months, there were varying degrees of induction in protein (1–5-fold) and mRNA expression (0–67-fold) for all CYPs examined. There was also an induction of HO-1 protein (nearly 9-fold) but no induction of HO-2. These data indicate the absence of significant alternative redox partners for liver microsomal CYP and HO, provide in vivo evidence for the significance of hepatic CPR-dependent enzymes in cholesterol homeostasis and systemic drug clearance, and reveal novel regulatory pathways of CYP expression associated with altered cellular homeostasis. The Alb-Cre/Cprlox mouse represents a unique model for studying the in vivo function of hepatic HO and microsomal CYP-dependent pathways in the biotransformation of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds.

Microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1The abbreviations used are: CYP, cytochrome P450; CPR, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase; NNK, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone; AP, acetaminophen; Cre, Cre recombinase; HO, heme oxygenase; mEH, microsomal epoxide hydrolase; RT, reverse transcription.1The abbreviations used are: CYP, cytochrome P450; CPR, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase; NNK, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone; AP, acetaminophen; Cre, Cre recombinase; HO, heme oxygenase; mEH, microsomal epoxide hydrolase; RT, reverse transcription. monooxygenases play important roles in the biotransformation of both endogenous and xenobiotic compounds (1Porter T.D. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13469-13472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The multiplicity of microsomal CYP genes (2Nelson D.R. Koymans L. Kamataki T. Stegeman J.J. Feyereisen R. Waxman D.J. Waterman M.R. Gotoh O. Coon M.J. Estabrook R.W. Gunsalus I.C. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1996; 6: 1-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (2634) Google Scholar), many of which have overlapping functions and similar tissue distribution profiles, often makes it difficult to distinguish the functions of individual CYP enzymes in a given tissue. Several CYP knockout mouse models have been developed, and initial studies using these mouse models have yielded important data on the role of specific CYPs in the metabolism and toxicity of xenobiotic compounds (for a recent review, see Ref. 3Gonzalez F.J. Kimura S. Mutation Res. Fund. Mol. Mech. Mutagenesis. 2001; 477: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, only limited insights have been gained from these models on the role of microsomal drug-metabolizing CYPs in the metabolism and homeostasis of endogenous compounds. Furthermore, the available CYP knockout mouse models are generally for those CYPs that do not have highly homologous genes in the same subfamily. It will be more difficult, or may be impractical, to use the knockout approach for subfamilies with multiple, highly homologous Cyp genes (e.g. Cyp2a–Cyp2d). Moreover, for many reasons, such as the current lack of knowledge on the regulation, substrate specificity, and strain difference of most of the mouse Cyp genes, and the overlapping substrate specificity of the highly homologous CYPs, it may be more informative and useful to determine the combined roles of all microsomal CYPs than to determine the role of a specific enzyme. For this purpose, one strategy would be to develop mouse models with targeted deletion of the Cpr gene, which is the obligate redox partner of all microsomal CYPs (4Black S.D. Coon M.J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat Areas Mol. Biol. 1987; 60: 35-87PubMed Google Scholar, 5Strobel H.W. Hodgson A.V. Shen S. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 225-244Crossref Google Scholar). The loss of CPR expression would lead to a suppression of the activities of all microsomal CYPs.In contrast to the multiplicity of microsomal CYP genes, there is only one CPR gene in mammals (6O'Leary K.A. Kasper C.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 379: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). CPR also functions as a redox partner for several other enzymes, including HO (7Schacter B.A. Nelson E.B. Marver H.S. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3601-3607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cytochrome b 5 (8Enoch H.G. Strittmatter P. J. Biol.

A critical role of microsomal CYP enzymes in embryonic development was recently demonstrated in a knockout mouse model with germ line deletion of the Cpr gene (12Shen A.L. O'Leary K.A. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6536-6541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, the impact of CPR loss on biological function and xenobiotic metabolism has not been examined in adult animals, which can be studied using a tissue-specific knockout approach (13Pluck A. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 1996; 77: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported recently 2L. Wu, J. Gu, Y. Weng, K. Kluetzman, P. Swiatek, M. Behr, Q.-Y. Zhang, X. Zhuo, Q. Xie, and X.

Ding, submitted for publication. the preparation and initial characterization of a mouse strain with a floxed Cpr allele (Cprlox); the mutant allele has the exons 3–15 of the Cpr gene flanked by two loxP sites, which permits Cre-mediated excision of the Cpr gene. Homozygous Cprlox mice are fertile and without any histological abnormality or any change in CPR expression. In the present study, we have prepared a mouse model with liver-specific deletion of the Cpr gene (designated Alb-Cre/Cprlox mice) by cross-breeding the Cprlox mice with transgenic mice having liver-specific Cre expression (Albumin-Cre or Alb-Cre; see Ref. 14Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y.J. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol.

The Alb-Cre/Cprlox mice were characterized for general health status, potential embryonic lethality, and fertility. The impact of liver-specific Cpr gene deletion on liver microsomal CYP and HO activities, in vivo drug clearance, plasma cholesterol level, and liver morphology was examined. The impact of CPR loss on microsomal CYP expression in liver and extrahepatic tissues was also characterized. Our data indicate the absence of significant alternative redox partners for liver microsomal CYP and HO, provide in vivo evidence for the significance of hepatic CPR-dependent enzymes in regulating plasma cholesterol level and systemic drug clearance, and reveal novel regulatory pathways of CYP expression associated with altered cellular homeostasis. We believe that the Alb-Cre/Cprlox mouse represents a unique model for studying the in vivo function of hepatic HO and of microsomal CYP-dependent pathways in the biotransformation of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimal Breeding and Genotype Analysis—Breeding pairs of hemizygous Alb-Cre transgenic mice, with Cre driven by the albumin promoter (14Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y.J. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol.

Generation and initial characterization of the Cprlox mouse strain have been reported elsewhere2; homozygous breeding pairs were on a mixed C57BL/6 and 129/Sv background. Offspring genotype was determined by PCR analysis of tail DNA for the Cre transgene (14Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y.J. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D.

Zhang Q.-Y. Genter M.B. Lipinskas T.W. Negishi M. Nebert D.W. Ding X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1287-1295PubMed Google Scholar); anti-rat CYP1A1/2, CYP2B1, -2E1, -3A2, and CPR (BD Biosciences); anti-rat HO-1 and anti-rat HO-2 (Stressgen); and anti-rat mEH (a gift from Dr. Charles Kasper of University of Wisconsin). Immunoblot quantification was carried out using a densitometer.Enzyme Activity Assays—All assays were carried out in duplicate. CPR activity was determined using cytochrome c as an electron acceptor (16Vermilion J.L. Coon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2694-2704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic activation of NNK was assayed by determination of the rates of formation of keto alcohol and keto aldehyde, as described previously (17Su T. Bao Z.P. Zhang Q.-Y. Smith T.J. Hong J.Y. Ding X. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5074-5079PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic activation of AP was assayed by a determination of the rates of formation of acetaminophen-glutathione conjugate (15Gu J. Zhang Q.-Y. Genter M.B. Lipinskas T.W. Negishi M. Nebert D.W. Ding X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1287-1295PubMed Google Scholar). For NNK, the combined rates of formation of keto alcohol and keto aldehyde were determined. The reaction mixtures contained 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm EDTA, an NADPH-generating system (5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NADP+, and 1.5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), 10 μm [3H]NNK (250 Ci/mol), 5 mm sodium bisulfite, and 0.5 mg/ml microsomal protein. For AP, the reaction mixtures contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 0.5 mm AP, 10 mm reduced glutathione, 1 mm NADPH, and 1.0 mg/ml liver microsomes. For both substrates, reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C.Microsomal HO activities were assayed by determination of the formation of bilirubin according to a protocol described by Maines (18Maines M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 473-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bilirubin concentration was measured by a determination of spectral differences between reaction mixtures containing NADPH and reference samples incubated without NADPH, with the use of a Cary 3E dual-beam spectrophotometer (Varian) and an extinction coefficient of 40 mm–1 cm–1 for absorbance differences between 464 and 530 nm. The reaction mixtures contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10 μm hemin (Sigma), 0.5 mg/ml liver microsomes, 1 mm NADPH (excluding reference samples), and 0.5 mg/ml mouse liver cytosol in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The cytosol fraction, which was used as the source of biliverdin reductase, was prepared from saline-perfused C57BL/6 mouse liver according to a protocol originally described for rats (18Maines M. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 473-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of NADPH, carried out at 37 °C for 30 min, and terminated by placing samples on ice.Pathology Procedure—Tissues were collected promptly after euthanasia and placed in at least 10 volumes of 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h. The tissues were then sectioned at 2–3 mm and processed for histologic examination in a VIP Tissue Tek processor (Sakura Finetech). After dehydration through a series of alcohols, tissues were cleared in xylene and impregnated with paraffin wax prior to embedding in blocks of paraffin wax. Sections were then cut at 3–4 μm and floated onto glass slides, baked at 60 °C overnight, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.RNA Preparation and Quantitative RNA-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from mouse liver with Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentrations were determined spectrally. The integrity of the RNA samples was assessed by the A 260/A 280 ratio and by ethidium bromide staining after electrophoretic analysis on denaturing gels. RT reactions were performed in a PE9600 PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) with an RNA-PCR kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. First strand cDNAs were synthesized at 42 °C with use of 1 μg of total RNA, 2.5 μm (dT)16 primer, 1 mm each of dNTP, and 5 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 20 μl. The relative levels of various CYP transcripts in the liver of “wild-type” and “homozygous” mice were determined using real time RT-PCR, with a LightCycler™ (Roche Applied Science).Real time PCRs were performed according to the instructions in the LightCycler™ FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Kit (Roche Applied Science), using gene-specific PCR primers for CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A4/5, CYP2B10, CYP2B20, CYP3A11, and CYP3A13. 3Q.-Y. Zhang, D. Dunbar, and L. S. Kaminsky, submitted for publication. PCR mixtures contained 2 μl of FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm each primer, and 4 μl of undiluted or diluted (10–1000-fold) RT product in a total volume of 20 μl. PCR was monitored for 45 cycles with annealing temperature at 60 °C. At the end of the PCR cycles, melting curve analysis was performed according to LightCycler™ kit instructions, to assess the purity of the PCR products. PCR products were also analyzed by electrophoresis on agarose gels to confirm PCR specificity. Negative control reactions (no template) were routinely included to monitor potential contamination of reagents. The relative levels of β-actin mRNA in various RNA samples were determined as described elsewhere, 3Q.-Y. Zhang, D. Dunbar, and L. S. Kaminsky, submitted for publication. and the results were used as an internal reference for the actual amounts of RNA added to each RT reaction. For each primer pair, a plot of the threshold cycle value versus the log of the amount of input RNA equivalent (0.1–100 ng, calculated from the dilution factor of the RT product) was generated, which was used to calculate the fold of difference in the levels of a CYP mRNA between the wild-type and the homozygous mice.Other Methods and Materials—Microsomes or postmitochondrial S9 fractions from liver and other tissues were prepared as described previously (15Gu J. Zhang Q.-Y. Genter M.B. Lipinskas T.W. Negishi M. Nebert D.W. Ding X. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1287-1295PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ding X. Coon M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 489-496PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Microsomal CYP concentration was determined by CO difference spectroscopy (20Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pentobarbital clearance test was performed essentially as described by Tsuji et al. (21Tsuji R. Isobe N. Kawasaki H. Toxicology. 1996; 108: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Mice were given pentobarbital (Sigma), intraperitoneally, as a 10 mg/ml solution in phosphate-buffered saline (2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 134 mm NaCl, and 8.2 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O), at a dose of 60 mg/kg. Plasma total cholesterol level was determined using the Infinity Cholesterol Reagent kit from Sigma (Procedure 401), with use of 10 μl of plasma per assay.RESULTSBreeding Statistics and General Characterization of Mice with Liver-specific Deletion of the Cpr Gene—Hemizygous Alb-Cre transgenic mice (with liver-specific expression of Cre recombinase) were crossed with mice homozygous for the Cprlox allele (Cprlox+/+). F1 pups with the Alb-Cre+/–/Cprlox+/– haplotype were crossed again with Cprlox+/+ mice, generating F2 pups with four different haplotypes: Alb-Cre+/–/Cprlox+/+ (designated as homozygous), Alb-Cre+/–/Cprlox+/– (designated as heterozygous), Alb-Cre–/–/Cprlox+/+ (designated as wild-type), and Alb-Cre–/–/Cprlox+/– (not used in this study). Haplotype frequency among F2 pups (percentage of pups with indicated genotype/total number of pups born) was 24% (52:215) for “homozygous” mice, 26% (56:215) for “heterozygous” mice, and 29% (63:215) for wild-type mice. There was no significant difference in haplotype frequency between the homozygous group and the wild-type control, as determined by a χ2 test (p > 0.05), indicating the absence of embryonic lethality among the homozygous pups. The homozygous mice were normal in coat color, general appearance, and daily activities. The results of a fertility test using 4 pairs of homozygous mice indicated that these mice are fertile, with an average litter size of 6 pups/pair.Time Course and Tissue Specificity of Cpr Gene Deletion— Liver-specific expression of the Cre transgene is expected to result in targeted deletion of the floxed Cpr allele, leading to deletion of the Cpr gene in Cre-expressing cells (Fig. 1A). Deficiency of hepatic CPR expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B). Decreases in microsomal CPR protein level were observed in both heterozygous and homozygous animals, at either 3 weeks or 2 months of age. Densitometric analysis of immunoblot data indicated that, at 3 weeks, hepatic microsomal CPR level was about 59 ± 9% in heterozygotes, compared with that of the wild-type littermates, and 18 ± 10% in homozygotes (means ± S.D., n = 6, males and females combined). The decrease in CPR expression was markedly more pronounced in the 2-month-old than in the 3-week-old mice; at 2 months, the level of CPR protein in liver microsomes from heterozygous mice was about 50% that in wild-type littermates and, as shown in Fig. 1, was not detected in homozygous mice (although, on longer exposure, a very faint band was detected in a sample from a male mouse; data not shown). Thus, the loss of CPR expression was essentially complete in the homozygous mice at 2 months after birth. On the other hand, in experiments not presented, no change in CPR protein level was observed in fetal liver at gestational day 14. The age-dependent increase in recombination efficiency, which reflects the age-dependent increase in Cre expression and accumulation of Cre protein in the nucleus, is consistent with previous observations on the Alb-Cre mice (22Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Genesis. 2000; 26: 149-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Additional immunoblot studies (examples are shown in Fig. 1C) with microsomes from lung, kidney, brain, and olfactory mucosa of 2-month-old mice indicated that there was no significant difference in CPR protein level among the three haplotypes, confirming tissue specificity of Cre expression (14Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y.J. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar).The Impact of a Decreased CPR Expression on Microsomal CYP and HO Activities—Differences among the three haplotypes, and between the two age groups, in liver microsomal CPR activity toward cytochrome c paralleled the differences in the levels of CPR protein (Fig. 2). Similarly, microsomal CYP activities toward NNK and AP, as well as HO activities, were also decreased in agreement with the decreases in CPR activity, except that the 3-week-old heterozygous mice did not show a decrease in HO activity and that the 2-month-old heterozygous mice did not show a significant decrease in the rates of NNK metabolism. At the age of 2 months, the homozygotes had 5–8% of wild-type activities toward NNK and AP and barely detectable HO activity (Fig. 2). At 3 weeks, the residual CYP activities were more substantial in the homozygotes, about 25%, whereas the HO activity was below 5%. These data confirm that CPR is the predominant, if not the only, electron donor for microsomal CYP as well as HO.Fig. 2Hepatic microsomal CPR, CYP, and HO activities in Alb-Cre/Cprlox and control mice. Six mice (three males and three females) were included in each haplotype group, at 3 weeks (A) or 2 months of age (B). Liver microsomes prepared from individual mice were used for activity determination. CPR activity was determined using cytochrome c as an electron acceptor. CYP activities were determined using NNK (10 μm) and AP (0.5 mm) as substrates. Microsomal HO activity was determined by detecting the formation of bilirubin, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with hemin at 10 μm. The activities are reported as the percentage of wild-type controls (means ± S.D., n = 6). The wild-type activities (means) were 190 and 190 nmol of cytochrome c reduced per min/mg of protein for CPR, 0.58 and 0.41 nmol of acetaminophen-glutathione conjugate/min/mg protein for AP, 0.13 and 0.13 nmol of metabolites (keto alcohol plus keto aldehyde)/min/mg protein for NNK, and 1.4 and 1.2 nmol of bilirubin/h/mg protein for HO for liver microsomes from 3-week-old and 2-month-old mice, respectively. *, p < 0.01; †, not detected (less than 0.05 nmol of bilirubin/h/mg of protein).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Impact of a Decreased CPR Expression in the Liver on Systemic Clearance of Pentobarbital—Pentobarbital is a sedative known to be metabolized by CYPs. The rates of in vivo pentobarbital clearance were monitored using the pentobarbital sleeping test (Table I). After treatment with a single dose of pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), all mice in the three haplotype groups lost righting reflex within 5 min. Whereas mice in the wild-type and heterozygous groups regained righting reflex after about 30 min, the homozygotes were still unconscious after 10 h, when the experiment was terminated. Thus, the loss of CPR activity in the homozygotes had a profound effect on in vivo drug metabolism and clearance, although smaller decreases in CPR activity in the heterozygotes did not have a significant impact on sleeping time.Table IDecreased pentobarbital clearance in Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox+/+ miceGenotypeOnset of sleepSleep durationminhAlb-Cre-/-/Cprlox+/+3.3 ± 0.60.5 ± 0.2Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox+/-5.0 ± 1.70.4 ± 0.2Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox+/+4.7 ± 0.6>10 Open table in a new tab The Impact of a Decreased CPR Expression in the Liver on Cholesterol Homeostasis and Liver Morphology—Several CPR-supported enzymes are involved in cholesterol synthesis, and microsomal CYPs are also involved in cholesterol metabolism. As shown in Table II, the decreases in hepatic CPR activity in the homozygous mice led to an 80% decrease in plasma total cholesterol levels at 2 months of age and about 30% decrease at 3 weeks of age, when they were compared with their wild-type littermates. On the other hand, cholesterol levels were not changed in heterozygotes, which had lesser decreases in microsomal CPR activity.Table IIDecreased plasma total cholesterol level in Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox+/+ miceGenotypePlasma total cholesterol level3-Week-old2-Month-oldmmol/literAlb-Cre-/-/Cprlox+/+2.2 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.6Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox+/-NDaND, not determined.3.1 ± 0.5Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox+/+1.5 ± 0.4 (68%)bp < 0.01, compared with the wild-type littermates.0.5 ± 0.2 (18%)bp < 0.01, compared with the wild-type littermates.a ND, not determined.b p < 0.01, compared with the wild-type littermates. Open table in a new tab At 2 months, the decreased cholesterol level in the homozygous mice was accompanied by a significant increase in liver weight/body weight ratio in both males and females (Table III); there was no significant change in body weight (Table III) or in the weights of other organs, including kidney, lung, heart, and brain (not shown). The liver enlargement was not observed at 3 weeks or in 2-month-old heterozygotes. The enlarged liver had a lighter red color than did the normal liver (Fig. 3A). Microscopic changes in homozygote livers consist of centrilobular and midzonal fine and coarse vacuolar changes (hepatic lipidosis; Fig. 3C). In addition, hepatocellular swelling without lipidosis, characterized by abundant lightly granular, pale, eosinophilic cytoplasm, as well as individual hepatocyte necrosis or apoptosis, and few scattered foci of coagulative necrosis (Fig. 3D), sometimes with secondary neutrophilic cell infiltrates, or hepatitis was observed in some homozygotes. In other experiments not presented, microscopic examination of livers from 3-week-old male and female mice showed mild microvesicular vacuolar changes in centrilobular hepatocytes of homozygotes, with rare occurrence of individual cell to focal necrosis of hepatocytes, which indicated early, subtle changes preceding the pathological changes seen in the older mice.Table IIIAge-dependent increases in the ratio of liver weight to body weight in Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox+/+ miceAgeHaplotypeBody weight (g)Liver weight (g)Ratio, liver weight/body weightMaleFemaleMaleFemaleMaleFemale3 weeksAlb-Cre-/-/Cprlox+/+8.7 ± 1.511.1 ± 1.50.53 ± 0.060.56 ± 0.060.048 ± 0.0050.051 ± 0.005Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox+/-9.9 ± 0.19.2 ± 1.80.53 ± 0.050.43 ± 0.050.054 ± 0.0060.048 ± 0.008Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox+/+11.0 ± 0.311.1 ± 0.80.49 ± 0.060.63 ± 0.060.054 ± 0.0030.057 ± 0.0032 monthsAlb-Cre-/-/Cprlox+/+29.2 ± 2.419.0 ± 0.51.52 ± 0.140.80 ± 0.030.052 ± 0.0040.042 ± 0.002Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox+/-27.4 ± 0.520.3 ± 0.11.37 ± 0.020.93 ± 0.120.050 ± 0.0020.046 ± 0.006Alb-Cre+/-/Cprlox+/+25.8 ± 3.821.4 ± 2.22.04 ± 0.491.57 ± 0.380.078 ± 0.008ap < 0.05, compared with the Alb-Cre-/-/Cprlox+/+ littermates.0.073 ± 0.012ap < 0.05, compared with the Alb-Cre-/-/Cprlox+/+ littermates.a p < 0.05, compared with the Alb-Cre-/-/Cprlox+/+ littermates.

https://openalex.org/W2002784951,"Expression of the Y-box protein YB-1 is increased in proliferating normal and cancer cells, but its role in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression is unclear. We have identified a cell cycle-dependent relocalization of YB-1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the G1/S phase transition and demonstrate that both the charged zipper and the cold shock domain are involved in regulating this process. Using cell lines that constitutively overexpress YB-1, we show that nuclear accumulation of YB-1 is associated with increased cyclin A and cyclin B1 mRNA and protein expression. We provide evidence that deregulated YB-1 expression is linked to adhesion-independent cell proliferation through the induction of cyclin A. Thus, we have identified YB-1 as a cell cycle stage-specific transcription factor important for cell proliferation.

Y-box proteins belong to a family of evolutionary conserved proteins, which function as transcription factors, regulators of RNA metabolism, and protein synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 1Matsumoto K.

Cell. 1997; 88: 637-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In non-dividing germ cells, Y-box proteins regulate the utilization of maternal and paternal stores of mRNA by the translational machinery (4Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol.

YB-1 was first identified as a DNA-binding protein that interacts with the Y-box sequence in major histocompatibility complex class II promoters (8Didier D.K. Schiffenbauer J. Woulfe S.L. Zacheis M. Schwartz B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7322-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). High levels of YB-1 are present in human fetal tissues of the heart, muscle, liver, lung, adrenal gland, and the brain (9Spitkovsky D.D. Royer-Pokora B. Delius H. Kisseljov F. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Royer H.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, the YB-1 expression patterns in most adult human tissues are unknown. A role of Y-box proteins in regulation of cell proliferation has been discussed, and high expression of Y-box proteins occurs under conditions of cell proliferation, e.g. in certain embryonal tissues, in fetal liver, in the regenerating liver after tissue damage (10Ladomery M. Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and in the proliferating compartment of colorectal mucosa (11Shibao K. Takano H. Nakayama Y. Okazaki K. Nagata N.

YB-1 is induced in T lymphocytes by interleukin 2 stimulation, where it is involved in stabilizing interleukin 2 mRNA (12Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Andersen J.S. Gaietta G. Jürchott K. Royer H.D. Mann M. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1236-1248PubMed Google Scholar). Several cell cycle-regulated genes contain Y-box sequences in their promoter or enhancer regions (10Ladomery M. Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). YB-1 interacts with p53, and it was discussed that this interaction is a mechanism for regulating gene expression (13Okamoto T. Izumi H. Imamura T. Takano H. Ise T. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Kohno K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6194-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). p53 is directly involved in regulating centrosome duplication (14Deng C.X. Brodie S.G. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 728-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and in view of this result it is interesting to note that YB-1 associates with the centrosome in mitotic cells (15Janz M. Jürchott K. Karawajew L. Royer H.D. Gene Funct. Dis. 2000; 1: 57-59Crossref Google Scholar). YB-1 is overexpressed in malignant tissues of certain breast cancer patients, where it facilitates the expression of the mdr1 gene (16Bargou R.C. Jürchott K. Wagener C. Bergmann S. Metzner S.

We have shown that YB-1 predicts drug resistance and patient outcome in breast cancer independent of clinically relevant tumor biologic factors HER2, UPA, and PAI-1 (17Janz M. Harbeck N. Dettmar P.

In addition to breast cancer, YB-1 is overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (18Shibahara K. Sugio K. Osaki T. Uchiumi T. Maehara Y. Kohno K. Yasumoto K. Sugimachi K. Kuwano M. Clin.

Cancer. 2000; 82: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we report that YB-1 changes its intracellular localization in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. Although located in the cytoplasm in G1 phase, YB-1 accumulates in the nucleus at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. YB-1 consists of the evolutionary conserved cold shock domain and a charged zipper, which is characterized by alternating negatively and positively charged subdomains. We find that this charged zipper region mediates nuclear accumulation of YB-1, and we show that the cold shock domain and the charged zipper domain are needed for cell cycle controlled nuclear targeting. In addition, we show that nuclear accumulation of YB-1 is associated with transcriptional activation of the cyclin A and cyclin B1 genes. Thus, YB-1 is a hitherto unrecognized cell cycle stage-specific transcription factor important for cell proliferation. Cell Culture and Cell Transfection—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, HBL100, HBL100-mock, Y1 and Y17 cells were maintained in RPMI (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and penicillin-streptomycin (Seromed-Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Stably transfected HBL100 cells (HBL100-mock, Y1, Y17) were grown in the presence of 5 μg/ml blasticidine. Transient transfections were done using N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium propane methylsulfate (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the protocol of the producer. For synchronization experiments, HeLa cells were treated with 20 μm lovastatin for 24 h. To release the cells from the lovastatin block, the medium was changed and synchronously growing cells were maintained in as described above. In certain experiments we added 2 mm sodium mevalonate for the lovastatin block release. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) 1The abbreviations used are: EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; G6PDH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; CSD, cold shock domain; RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.—Nuclear extracts of HBL100 cells and Y17 cells were prepared as described recently (22Royer H.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). 5 μg of each nuclear extract was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with the 32P-end-labeled single-stranded oligonucleotide. The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-GCT TTC ATT GGT CCA TTT CA-3′, derived from the human cyclin A promoter; 5′-ACG AAC AGG CCA ATA AGG AG-3′, derived from the cyclin B1 promoter (proximal CCAAT-box); 5′-CGG CAG CCG CCA ATG GGA AG-3′, derived from the cyclin B1 promoter (distal CCAAT-box); 5′-TGA GGC TGA TTG GCT GGG CA-3′, derived from the human mdr1 promoter sequence –86 to –67 (Y-box: –82 to –73; Ref. 23Goldsmith M.E.

L48996, nucleotides 987–1006). The DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a non-denaturing (native) 4% polyacrylamide gel. For autoradiography, X-Omat AR film (Kodak GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany) was exposed overnight. Cell Fractionation and Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested using a solution of trypsin/EDTA and immediately lysed in ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0,6% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors. After centrifugation for 10 min (6100 rpm) at 4 °C in an Eppendorf centrifuge, the residual nuclear pellets were washed with the buffer described above and lysed in sample buffer. For immunoblotting, standard procedures were used. Immunoblots were developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were grown on slides, fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1), and preincubated for 30 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1,5% horse serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were incubated for 30 min with the polyclonal anti-YB-1 antibody at a dilution of 1:200. To detect the V5 epitope, cells were incubated for 60 min with a monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) at a dilution of 1:50. To detect cyclin E, the cells were incubated for 60 min with a monoclonal antibody specific for cyclin E at a dilution of 1:20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). To detect bound immunoglobulins, we used an anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein F(ab′)2 fragment at a dilution of 1:200, or an anti-mouse Ig-rhodamine F(ab′)2 at a dilution of 1:100 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). For nuclear staining, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) was added in the last incubation step. Staining was evaluated in a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Bensheim, Germany). Relative Quantitative Two-step Real-time RT-PCR—Isolation of total RNA was carried out by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). The reverse transcriptase reaction as well as PCR was carried out as recently described (24Stein U. Jürchott K. Schläfke M. Hohenberger P. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 3282-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Expression of cyclin A, cyclin B1, and the housekeeping gene glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was determined in duplicate from the same RT reaction. The G6PDH primers were obtained commercially (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). For cyclin A a 140-bp amplicon was designed using the forward primer (5′-gagctatcctcgtggactgg-3′), the reverse primer (5′-gcccacaagctgaagttttc-3′), a FITC-labeled probe (5′-cctgcatttggctgtgaactacattgata-3′), and a LCRed-labeled probe (5′-gttcctgtcttccatgtcagtgctgag-3′) (TIB Molbiol, Berlin, Germany). For cyclin B1 a 140-bp amplicon was designed using a forward primer (5′-accaaaatacctactgggtcgg-3′), a reverse primer (5′-gcatgaaccgatcaataatgg-3′), a FITC-labeled probe (5′-tggctagtacaggttcaaatgaaattcagg-3′), and a LCRed-labeled probe, (5′-tgttgcaggagaccatgtacatgactgt-3′) (TIB MOLBIOL). The calibrator cDNA from HeLa cells was employed in serial dilutions simultaneously in each run. FACS Analysis—Cell samples were fixed in ice-cold ethanol. After fixation, the cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml). Fluorescence intensity of 1 × 104 cells was measured with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The distribution of cell cycle phases was analyzed using the program Cylchred version 1.0.2 for Windows 95, which is available on-line (University of Wales, Cardiff, Wales, UK). Reporter Gene Assays—HBL100 and Y17 cells were transfected with the cyclin A reporter gene construct (pALUC), which contains a cyclin A promoter fragment fused to the luciferase gene. In all transient transfection assays, 105 cells were transfected using the FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). For transfection, 3 μl/2 μg DNA and 0.2 μg of control DNA were used. The control DNA pRL-null vector was obtained from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). Luciferase activity was determined with the luciferase dual system kit (Promega). To examine cyclin B1 we used the p240B1 plasmid, which contains a cyclin B1 promoter fragment fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. The reporter gene constructs and mutants are described in the text. To determine CAT activity, 105 HBL100 and Y17 cells were transfected under conditions we have previously described (25Stein U. Jürchott K. Walther W. Bergmann S. Schlag P.M. Royer H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28562-28569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). CAT activity was measured using the CAT-ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics). All measurements were done in duplicate. Absorbance was measured at 492 nm, and CAT values were calculated from the CAT standard curve, using the EasySoftG200/Easy-Fit software (SLT-Lab Instruments, Crailsheim, Germany). The amount of CAT protein was normalized to the protein content in the lysate. Transfection efficiencies was controlled by co-transfection with the pCATBasic plasmid. Breast Tissue Specimens and Immunohistochemistry—All clinical specimens in this study were obtained during surgery. Breast tissues were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut into sections. The sections were immunostained following a protocol provided by the producer of the APAAP dual system kit (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Specimens were coded by numbers and evaluated by three independent investigators. The Intracellular Localization of YB-1 Is Cell Cycle-regulated—It has been previously reported that YB-1 is located predominantly in the perinuclear space of the cytoplasm (26Holm P.S. Bergmann S. Jürchott K. Lage H. Brand K. Ladhoff A. Mantwill K. Curiel D.T. Dobbelstein M. Dietel M. Gansbacher B. Royer H.D. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 7277-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and that certain cellular stresses like hyperthermia and UV irradiation cause nuclear accumulation of the protein (25Stein U. Jürchott K. Walther W. Bergmann S. Schlag P.M. Royer H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28562-28569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We investigated the intracellular distribution of YB-1 in exponentially growing HeLa cells by indirect immunofluorescence using purified peptide-specific polyclonal antibodies directed against the N terminus of YB-1 (Fig. 1A). Although YB-1 was found in the cytoplasm of all cells, a subset of cells contained YB-1 in the nucleus (arrows). The frequency of exponentially growing cells with nuclear YB-1 was ∼5%. We considered it possible that the subcellular distribution of YB-1 is cell cycle-regulated. To test this hypothesis, we synchronized HeLa cells with lovastatin, which causes a cell cycle arrest in early G1 phase (29Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3602-3609PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were released from the lovastatin block by replacement of the culture medium allowing the cells to proceed through the cell cycle. We analyzed cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions by immunoblotting at various time points after release from the lovastatin block (Fig. 1B). At all time points, YB-1 was present in the cytoplasm (left panel), whereas it appeared in the nucleus 9 to 10 h after the lovastatin block release (right panel, lanes 7 and 8). In some experiments we supplemented the fresh culture medium with a 100-old excess of mevalonate to accelerate the release of the lovastatin block (29Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3602-3609PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments we detected a nuclear accumulation of YB-1 by indirect immunofluorescence approximately 7 h after the release (Fig. 1C, left panel). We observed that YB-1 moves to the nucleus at the same time as cyclin E (Fig. 1C, right panel). Thus, YB-1 is present in the nucleus at the boundary between G1 and S phase of the cell cycle. Based on these data we conclude that YB-1 is a cell cycle stage-specific transcription factor. Cell Cycle-regulated Nuclear Accumulation of YB-1 Depends on Both the Cold Shock Domain and the C-terminal Tail—To investigate which region of the YB-1 protein is required for nuclear accumulation in S phase, we constructed a set of deletion mutants of YB-1 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). HeLa cells were transiently transfected with these constructs, and the localization of the fusion proteins was analyzed in living cells by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2, A–D). The full-length form of YB-1 was located in the cytoplasm, but also in the nuclei of a subset of transfected cells (Fig. 2A, c1). In contrast, the GFP control showed a homogeneous distribution within the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 2A, GFP). We noted that endogenous YB-1 was located in the nuclei of ∼5% of exponentially growing cells (Fig. 1A), and a similar frequency was detected in the transfected cells (Fig. 2A, c1). This indicates that the intracellular distribution of full-length GFP/YB-1 molecules is cell cycle-regulated just as the endogenous YB-1 protein. All transfection experiments with GFP constructs were repeated three times, and ∼100 individual transfected cells were examined. Next we investigated the intracellular distribution of an isolated cold shock domain (CSD) in transfected cells (Fig. 2A, c6). The figure shows that the CSD is predominant in the cytoplasm but also occurs in the nucleus with a diffuse distribution. It was our next goal to determine the contribution of the C-terminal tail of YB-1 to nuclear targeting. In the following experiments, we have used a version of YB-1 that lacks 20 amino acids of the N terminus. However, these amino acids are not required for cell cycle controlled YB-1 nuclear accumulation (Fig. 2B, c2). The C termini of Y-box transcription factors share a similar block distribution of basic and acidic amino acids, but little primary sequence homology (30Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9028-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The positions of the four clusters of basic amino acids in the C-terminal tail of YB-1 are indicated by boxes in the schematic drawing of an GFP/YB-1 fusion protein (Fig. 2). In the GFP/YB-1 fusion protein constructs c3, c4, and c5, one or more of the basic amino acid clusters were deleted. A deletion of the basic amino acid cluster at the very end of the C-terminal tail of YB-1 was associated with a loss of cell cycle-regulated nuclear accumulation of YB-1, as the GFP/YB-1 fusion protein was located either in the cytoplasm or the nucleus in 50% of the transfected cells (Fig. 2B, c3). A deletion of the adjacent cluster of basic amino acids was associated with a nuclear location of the GFP/YB-1 fusion protein in 100% of the transfected cells (Fig. 2B, c4). In contrast, a deletion of the third cluster of basic amino acids (Fig. 2B, c5) was associated with a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution of the GFP/YB-1 fusion protein in 100% of transfected cells. Next we investigated the intracellular distribution of an isolated C-terminal tail domain of YB-1 (Fig. 2C, c7). This molecule contains the four clusters of basic amino acids. In 100% of transfected cells, the GFP fusion protein was located in the nucleus with a speckled distribution. We generated additional GFP fusion proteins of the C-terminal tail domain YB-1, which are shown schematically in Fig. 2C. It is evident that the presence of two or three clusters of basic amino acids in the fusion protein is associated with a nuclear localization in 100% of transfected cell (Fig. 2C, c9, c11). We further divided the C terminus of YB-1 into four single clusters according to the stretches of basic/aromatic amino acids. Only the second cluster of basic amino acids at position 171–225 of the C-terminal tail of YB-1 was able to direct the fusion protein into the nuclei of 100% of the transfected cells (Fig. 2D, c13), whereas the three other fusion proteins seem to be diffusely distributed in the cells (Fig. 2, C (c15) and D (c12 and c14)). This pattern is indistinguishable from the intracellular distribution of the GFP control (Fig. 2A, GFP). To discriminate between cytoplasmic retention and active nuclear import of GFP/YB-1, we fused a SV40-derived nuclear localization sequence to the GFP/YB-1 protein. In transfected cells, the fusion protein was located either in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. In these experiments 50% of the cells contained the fusion protein in the nucleus and another 50% in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these data indicate that at least two different regions of the C terminus are responsible for the nuclear targeting of YB-1, and that both the CSD and the C-terminal domain are required for cell cycle-regulated nuclear import. YB-1 Interacts with the Y-box Motif in the Cyclin A Promoter—We have shown previously that YB-1 acts as activator of transcription (16Bargou R.C. Jürchott K. Wagener C. Bergmann S. Metzner S. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Winzer K.J. Dietel M. Dörken B. Royer H.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Here we report cell cycle-dependent subcellular movements of YB-1. Taken together these data demonstrate that YB-1 is a cell cycle-regulated transcription factor. This finding raised the question which cell cycle-associated genes might be regulated by YB-1. Reports from the literature demonstrated the presence of Y-boxes in the promoters of the cyclin A and cyclin B1 genes (31Henglein B. Chenivesse X. Wang J. Eick D. Bréchot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 32Katula K.S. Wright K.L. Paul H. Surman D.R. Nuckolls F.J. Smith J.W. Ting J.P. Yates J. Cogswell J.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 811-820PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to determine the significance of YB-1 for cyclin A and cyclin B1 gene regulation. The promoter region –79 to +100 relative to the predominant transcription initiation site facilitates cell cycle-controlled expression of the cyclin A gene (31Henglein B. Chenivesse X. Wang J. Eick D. Bréchot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5490-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and the Y-box located at position –55 to –50 mediates adhesion-dependent cyclin A gene activation at the G1/S boundary (33Krämer A. Carstens C.-P. Fahl W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6579-6582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To test whether YB-1 binds to the Y-box of the cyclin A gene, we wished to use YB-1 isolated from the nuclear compartment of cells for EMSA. For this purpose, HBL100 cells were stably transfected with a YB-1 cDNA construct whose expression is controlled by the CMV promoter (28Koike K. Uchiumi T. Ohga T. Toh S. Wada M. Kohno K. Kuwano M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This cell line, termed Y17, constitutively overexpresses YB-1. The YB-1 cDNA construct contained a V5 epitope, which appears at the C terminus of YB-1. This permits detection of the exogenous YB-1 protein with a monoclonal antibody specific for the V5 epitope. To demonstrate expression of the epitope-tagged YB-1 protein, Y17 cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. The exogenous YB-1 protein is localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus in the majority of cells (Fig. 3, bottom, left panel). The lack of any V5-related signal in HBL100 cells demonstrates the specificity of immunostaining (Fig. 3, top, left panel). Nuclear accumulation of YB-1 in Y17 cells was also demonstrated by immunoblotting using a nuclear extract and antibodies specific for the V5 epitope (data not shown). Nuclear accumulation of overexpressed YB-1 protein is not affected by the V5 tag, because overexpressed YB-1 without a V5 tag is also located in the nucleus (16Bargou R.C. Jürchott K. Wagener C. Bergmann S. Metzner S. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Winzer K.J. Dietel M. Dörken B. Royer H.D. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Thus, increased levels of YB-1 are associated with nuclear accumulation independent of the cell cycle. For EMSA, a radiolabeled single-stranded 20-bp oligonucleotide comprising the Y-box motif of the cyclin A gene promoter was used (Fig. 4). Three major retarded DNA-protein complexes were formed (arrows) with the extract from Y17 cells (lane 2). We denominate the slow moving complex as complex A and the two faster moving complexes as B and C. A report from the literature demonstrated by UV-cross-linking that the same cyclin A promoter fragment that we have used for EMSA here binds two proteins with a molecular mass of 40 and 115 kDa (33Krämer A. Carstens C.-P. Fahl W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6579-6582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Formation of the retarded complexes A, B, and C was less prominent with a nuclear extract from exponentially growing HBL100 cells (lane 3). Specificity of complex formation was demonstrated by competition with a molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides comprising the Y-box sequence from the cyclin A promoter (lanes 4–6) and the mdr1 gene (lanes 7–9). To demonstrate that YB-1 is present in retarded complexes, we performed an immunoshift with an affinity-purified YB-1 antibody (lanes 13 and 14). The results demonstrate that formation of complex A, B, and C was inhibited by the antibody specific for YB-1. Our data demonstrate that YB-1 specifically interacts with the Y-box motif in the cyclin A promoter. YB-1 Specifically Interacts with the Proximal and Distal CCAAT Box of the Cyclin B1 Promoter—S phase induction of cyclin B1 gene expression is mediated by a proximal and distal CCAAT-box within the first 90 bp of the cyclin B1 promoter (32Katula K.S. Wright K.L. Paul H. Surman D.R. Nuckolls F.J. Smith J.W. Ting J.P. Yates J. Cogswell J.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 811-820PubMed Google Scholar). Because CCAAT-boxes are inverted Y-boxes, these motifs are potential binding sites for YB-1. Preliminary results obtained by EMSA demonstrated an interaction of YB-1 with both the sense and antisense strands of the distal and proximal CCAAT motifs from the cyclin B1 promoter (data not shown). To show specificity we used EMSA and competition with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides comprising the CCAAT sequence motifs from the distal and proximal CCAAT-boxes and a Y-box motif from the multidrug resistance gene (mdr1) promoter. First we investigated the proximal CCAAT-box (Fig. 5A). This oligonucleotide formed a major retarded DNA-protein complex (lane 3, arrow) with nuclear extracts from Y17 cells. This complex corresponds to complex B (Fig. 5A). The formation of this complex was efficiently inhibited by a molar excess of the CCAAT motif from the proximal promoter (lanes 4–6) and by the Y-box from the mdr1 promoter (lanes 7–9). Complex formation was not affected by an unrelated control oligonucleotide (lanes 10–12). The presence of YB-1 in this retarded complex was demonstrated by an immunoshift (lanes 13 and 14). We then analyzed the YB-1 interaction with the distal CCAAT-box from the cyclin B1 promoter (Fig. 5B). In this case two major retarded complexes were formed with nuclear extracts from Y17 cells (lane 3). These complexes correspond to complex B and C (Fig. 5A). Similar complexes were formed with nuclear extracts from exponentially growing HBL1"
https://openalex.org/W2053444524,"CCN3 (NOV) is a matricellular protein of the CCN family, which also includes CCN1 (CYR61), CCN2 (CTGF), CCN4 (WISP-1), CCN5 (WISP-2), and CCN6 (WISP-3). During development, CCN3 is expressed widely in derivatives of all three germ layers, and high levels of expression are observed in smooth muscle cells of the arterial vessel wall. Altered expression of CCN3 has been observed in a variety of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinomas, Wilm's tumors, Ewing's sarcomas, gliomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and adrenocortical carcinomas. To understand its biological functions, we have investigated the activities of purified recombinant CCN3. We show that in endothelial cells, CCN3 supports cell adhesion, induces directed cell migration (chemotaxis), and promotes cell survival. Mechanistically, CCN3 supports human umbilical vein endothelial cell adhesion through multiple cell surface receptors, including integrins αvβ3, α5β1, α6β1, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. In contrast, CCN3-induced cell migration is dependent on integrins αvβ3 and α5β1, whereas α6β1 does not play a role in this process. Although CCN3 does not contain a RGD sequence, it binds directly to immobilized integrins αvβ3 and α5β1, with half-maximal binding occurring at 10 nm and 50 nm CCN3, respectively. Furthermore, CCN3 induces neovascularization when implanted in rat cornea, demonstrating that it is a novel angiogenic inducer. Together, these findings show that CCN3 is a ligand of integrins αvβ3 and α5β1, acts directly upon endothelial cells to stimulate pro-angiogenic activities, and induces angiogenesis in vivo.

It is a member of the CCN 1The abbreviations used are: CCN, cysteine-rich 61/connective tissue growth factor/nephroblastoma overexpressed; BACEC, bovine adrenal capillary endothelial cell; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ECM, extracellular matrix; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FN, fibronectin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; IgG, immunoglobulin G; LN, laminin; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TUNEL, in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling; VN, vitronectin; nt, nucleotides. family, which also includes CCN1 (CYR61), CCN2 (CTGF), CCN4 (WISP-1), CCN5 (WISP-2), and CCN6 (WISP-3) (3Brigstock D.R.

Inasmuch as these cysteine-rich, secreted proteins are associated with the ECM but serve regulatory rather than structural functions, they can be considered matricellular proteins (5Bornstein P. Sage E.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 608-616Google Scholar). Members of the CCN family are composed of an N-terminal secretory signal peptide followed by four conserved domains with homology to insulin-like growth factor binding protein, von Willebrand factor type C repeat, thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and a C-terminal domain (CT) with heparin-binding motifs and sequence similarity to the C termini of von Willebrand factor and mucin (6Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Google Scholar). In keeping with their homology to ECM proteins and localization to the ECM, several CCN proteins have been shown to support cell adhesion, induce focal adhesion complexes, and stimulate adhesive signaling (7Kireeva M.L.

Although CCN proteins do not contain a RGD sequence motif, both CCN1 and CCN2 are direct ligands of multiple integrin receptors, which mediate many of their activities (11Jedsadayanmata A. Chen C.C.

Targeted disruption of the CCN1 gene in mice resulted in embryonic lethality due to vascular defects (23Mo F.E. Muntean A.G. Chen C.C. Stolz D.B. Watkins S.C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8709-8720Google Scholar), whereas CCN2-null mice die perinatally due to respiratory failure as a consequence of skeletal malformation (18Ivkovic S. Popoff S.N. Safadi F.F. Zhao M. Stephenson R.C. Yoon B.S. Daluiski A. Segarini P. Lyons K.M. Development. 2003; 130: 2779-2791Google Scholar). These findings indicate that members of the CCN family serve essential and non-redundant functions during development. Relatively little is known about the functions of CCN3. During embryonic development, CCN3 is widely expressed in derivatives of all three germ layers, with high levels of expression in skeletal muscle, smooth muscle of vessel walls, the nervous system, adrenal cortex, and differentiating chondrocytes (24Su B.Y.

Laurent M. Schofield P.N. Le Bouc Y. J Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 3929-3940Google Scholar). In the adult, CCN3 expression is high in the arterial vessel wall, and the expression pattern changes following vascular injury (28Ellis P.D. Chen Q. Barker P.J. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1912-1919Google Scholar). CCN3 interacts with the epidermal growth factor-like domain of Notch1 and positively regulate Notch signaling (29Sakamoto K. Yamaguchi S. Ando R. Miyawaki A. Kabasawa Y. Takagi M. Li C.L. Perbal B. Katsube K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29399-29405Google Scholar). In addition, CCN3 interacts with fibulin in a yeast two-hybrid assay and may regulate calcium signaling (30Perbal B. Martinerie C. Sainson R. Werner M. He B. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 869-874Google Scholar, 31Li C.L. Martinez V. He B. Lombet A. Perbal B. Mol. Pathol. 2002; 55: 250-261Google Scholar). Altered expression of CCN3 has been observed in a variety of tumors, including hepatocellular carcinomas, Wilm's tumors, Ewing's sarcomas, gliomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and adrenocortical carcinomas (27Martinerie C.

J Pathol. 2002; 160: 849-859Google Scholar). In contrast to CCN1 and CCN2, which are immediate-early genes transcriptionally activated by mitogenic growth factors in fibroblasts and are repressed under conditions of growth arrest (35Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1182-1186Google Scholar, 36O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Google Scholar, 37Brunner A. Chinn J. Neubauer M. Purchio A.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 293-300Google Scholar), CCN3 is repressed by growth factors but induced by serum deprivation or contact inhibition (38Scholz G. Martinerie C. Perbal B. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 481-486Google Scholar, 39Lafont J. Laurent M. Thibout H. Lallemand F. Le Bouc Y. Atfi A. Martinerie C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41220-41229Google Scholar). Thus, it has been hypothesized that CCN3 may serve as an antagonist to CCN1 and CCN2, and play antithetical roles in similar biological processes. Since CCN1 and CCN2 have been shown to be angiogenic inducers (12Babic A.M. Chen C.-C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2958-2966Google Scholar, 16Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F.

Biochem. (Tokyo.). 1999; 126: 137-145Google Scholar), we speculated that CCN3 might work as an angiogenic inhibitor. In this study, we show that purified recombinant CCN3 interacts with multiple integrin receptors and binds directly to integrins αvβ3 and α5β1. Contrary to expectation, CCN3 is pro-angiogenic in endothelial cells, supporting cell adhesion and promoting cell migration and survival. Furthermore, CCN3 induces neovascularization in a corneal micropocket assay. These results identify CCN3 as a novel angiogenic factor and suggest its possible functions in development and tumor growth. Cell Culture—HUVECs were grown as described by the supplier (Cascade Biologics, Inc., Portland, OR) and used before passage 16. BACECs (a generous gift from Dr. Judah Folkman, Harvard Medical School) were grown in plates coated with 1.5% gelatin (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, JRH Bioscience, Lenexa, KS) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Intergene, Purchase, NY) and 3 ng/ml bFGF (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); they were used before passage 16. Antibodies, Peptides, and Reagents—Function-blocking mAbs against various integrins were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) [AV1 (anti-αv), LM609 (anti-αvβ3), and JBS5 (anti-α5β1)], Beckman-Coulter, Inc. (Fullerton, CA) [NKI-GoH3 (anti-α6), and SAM-1 (anti-α5)], and Invitrogen [P4C10 (anti-β1)]. Normal mouse IgG was from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) and normal rabbit serum was from Sigma-Aldrich. GRGDSP and GRGESP peptides were purchased from Invitrogen. RGDS and RGES peptides were from American Peptide Company, Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA). Heparin (sodium salt, from porcine intestinal mucosa) was from Sigma-Aldrich. bFGF, FN, VN, and LN were obtained from Invitrogen. Purified integrins αvβ3 and α5β1 were from Chemicon. Purification of Recombinant CCN3—Human CCN3 cDNA was constructed by ligation of a 5′ (nt 72–654, GenBank™ X96584) and 3′ (nt 654–1653) fragments, and the resulting full-length cDNA was cloned into pKS+ and verified by sequencing. The 5′ fragment (nt 72–654) was obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using total RNA isolated from serum-starved human skin fibroblasts using the primer set 5′-AGCAGTGCCAATCTACAGC-3′ and 5′-CAGCATCTCACATTGACGG-3′. The RT-PCR product was digested with SphI and StyI to yield a fragment containing nt 72–654. The 3′ fragment (nt 654–1653) was generated by restriction digestion of IMAGE clone 49415 (human neonatal brain, nt 590–1653) with StyI and XbaI. To produce recombinant CCN3 protein, the full-length CCN3 cDNA was cloned into the baculovirus expression vector pBlueBac 4.5 (Invitrogen). The vector was modified to encode an enterokinase histidine tag linked to the C terminus of CCN3 in a manner similar to that previously described for expression of CCN1 (21Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Google Scholar). CCN3 was produced in serum-free baculovirus expression system using High Five insect cells as described (21Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Google Scholar). Briefly, High Five cells were maintained in serum-free EX-CELL 400 medium (JRH Bioscience) at 27 °C and infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Conditioned medium was collected at 38 h postinfection, adjusted to 20 mm sodium phosphate, and applied to a Sepharose SP (Sigma-Aldrich) column at 4 °C. After washing with a 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 300 mm NaCl, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.4–1 m) in phosphate buffer. Fractions containing CCN3 as judged by SDS-PAGE were pooled and further purified on a nickel-agarose column as described (21Grzeszkiewicz T.M. Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Google Scholar). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and immunoblotting (Fig. 1). Preparation of Antisera and Affinity-purified Antibodies—The second domain of CCN3 (von Willebrand type C repeat) and the central variable region were cloned separately as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and used as antigens to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. DNA fragments were generated by polymerase chain reactions using primers sets 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGGTAGAGGGAGATAACTGTG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCAGCTGCAAGGGTAAGGCCTCC-3′ (encoding amino acids 104–188), and 5′-GATGAGGAGGATTCACTGGGA-3 and 5′-AATGCAGTTGACACTTGAG-3′ (encoding amino acids 176–207). To facilitate cloning, the forward primers start with a BamHI site, and the reverse primers end with an EcoRI site. The resulting cDNA fragments were cloned directionally into the PGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences) and confirmed by sequence analysis. The GST fusion proteins were purified on a glutathione S Sepharose column and used as antigens. Antisera and affinity-purified antibodies were produced according to standard protocols (40Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 314-315Google Scholar). IgG was purified from antisera using protein A column chromatography (Pierce Biotechnology). For affinity purification, antisera were first passed through a GST column to remove antibodies against GST and then purified through a GST-CCN3 (VWC domain)-affinity column. Anti-CCN3 antibodies did not cross-react with CCN1 or VN (data not shown) by ELISA. Cell Adhesion Assay—Cell adhesion assays were performed essentially as described (7Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Google Scholar). Briefly, test proteins were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and coated onto 96-well microtiter plates (50 μl per well) with incubation at 4 °C for 16 h. Wells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 h. To test for specificity, affinity-purified anti-CCN3 antibodies or normal rabbit IgG was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C prior to plating of cells. HUVECs were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5 mm EDTA, washed, and resuspended at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 1% BSA. Where indicated, cells were mixed with either EDTA, Ca2+, Mg2+, peptides, or heparin prior to plating or incubated with antibodies for1hat room temperature prior to plating. Cell suspension (50 μl) was added to each well, and adherent cells were fixed in 10% formalin after 30 min incubation at 37 °C. Cells were stained with methylene blue, and adhesion was quantified by dye extraction and measurement of absorbance at 620 nm (7Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Google Scholar). Solid Phase Integrin Binding Assay—The binding of CCN3 to purified integrins αvβ3 and α5β1 was measured by ELISA as described previously with modifications (19Kireeva M.L. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3090-3096Google Scholar). For CCN3 binding to immobilized integrin, microtiter wells (Immulon 2, Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) were coated with purified integrin (1 μg/ml) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed with buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5 containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2) and blocked with 1% heat-inactivated BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Soluble CCN3 was added and allowed to bind at 4 °C for 16 h; bound ligand was detected using affinity-purified anti-CCN3 antibodies (1: 1000). For integrin binding to immobilized ligands, microtiter wells were coated with 10 μg/ml CCN3, 10 μg/ml FN, or 1 μg/ml VN as described above. Where indicated, coated wells were preincubated with affinity-purified anti-CCN3 antibodies or normal rabbit serum for2hat room temperature. After washing, purified integrin αvβ3 or α5β1 (1 μg/ml in buffer with 25 mm octylglucoside) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Where indicated, soluble integrin was either mixed with EDTA, Mg2+, or peptides prior to plating, or incubated with function-blocking monoclonal antibodies for 30 min at 4 °C prior to plating. After washing, bound integrins were detected with polyclonal anti-integrin αv (AB1930) or α5 antibodies (AB1926)(Chemicon). When blocking with anti-CCN3 antibodies, mAbs against integrin αv (P3G8) or β1 (HUTS-4)(Chemicon) were used to detect integrin binding. After washing, wells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2500), and color reaction was developed using a horseradish peroxidase immunoassay kit (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) with absorbance measured at 420 nm. Cell Migration Assay—A 48-well modified Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was used to assay cell migration as described with modifications (16Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Google Scholar). BACECs were harvested with trypsin, washed, and resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were loaded into wells of the lower chamber; the wells were then covered with a gelatinized polycarbonate filter (5 μm pore diameter, Nuclepore) followed by the upper chamber. Where indicated, cells were either mixed with peptides or incubated with antibodies (1 h at room temperature) prior to loading. The chamber was inverted to allow cells to attach (2 h at 37 °C) and re-inverted, and test proteins, diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA, were added to the top chamber. Where indicated, CCN3 and FN were preincubated with anti-CCN3 antibodies for 1 h prior to loading. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the membrane was removed and stained using a Diff-Quik Kit (Dade-Behring, Deer-field, IL). Cell migration was monitored by counting the total number of cells migrated in 10 randomly selected microscope fields at ×400 magnification. Measurement of Apoptosis and DNA Synthesis—Apoptosis and mitogenesis was assessed largely as described (14Leu S.-J. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46248-46255Google Scholar). To measure apoptosis, HUVECs were starved for 16 h, harvested, and resuspended in serum-free medium containing 0.5% BSA. Coverslips were coated overnight at 4 °C with 20 μg/ml mouse LN (ultrapure grade; Becton-Dickinson Biosciences, Bedford, MA) and blocked with 1% heat-inactivated BSA. Cells were plated on LN-coated coverslips at 10,000 cells/cm2 and allowed to attach for 4 h at 37 °C. Soluble CCN3, serum (20%) or GRGDSP peptide (50 μm) was added, and incubation continued for another 16 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, CCN3 was incubated with anti-CCN3 antibodies for 1 h at room temperature prior to addition to cells. After incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformeldahyde (pH 7.4) and apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay using the in situ cell death detection kit POD (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were lightly stained with hematoxylin and apoptotic nuclei counted. A total of 500 cells were counted from random fields in each coverslip, and the number of apoptotic cells was represented as a percentage of the total cells counted. To assess proliferation, cells were grown as described above except that 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was included in the medium for 16 h in the presence or absence of CCN3. BrdU incorporation was detected using the BrdUrd staining kit (Calbiochem Novabiochem Corp., San Diego, CA). Rat Corneal Pocket Angiogenesis Assay—CCN3-induced neovascularization was examined in vivo by implanting Hydron pellets, formulated with test substances, into rat corneas essentially as described (16Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Google Scholar). Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and Hydron pellets (Interferon Sciences, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) containing test substances were implanted into micropockets made in the corneal stroma 1 to 1.5 mm from the corneal limbus. Where indicated, CCN3 and bFGF were incubated with anti-CCN3 antibodies for 1 h at room temperature prior to being incorporated into the Hydron pellet. 7 days postimplantation, rats were perfused with India ink with heparin (100-U bolus), and neovascularization was examined and scored. CCN3 Mediates Endothelial Cell Adhesion through Integrins αvβ3, α6β1, and α5β1—To examine the pro-angiogenic activities of CCN3, we purified recombinant human CCN3 using a baculovirus expression system (Fig. 1). We first tested its ability to support endothelial cell adhesion, and found that immobilized CCN3 was able to support HUVEC adhesion in a dose-dependent and saturable manner (Fig. 2A). Incubation of CCN3-coated surfaces with affinity-purified anti-CCN3 antibodies prior to plating cells abolished adhesion, whereas incubation of VN-coated surfaces with the same antibodies had no effect (Fig. 2B). These results confirmed that the CCN3 protein indeed supports HUVEC adhesion. CCN1 and CCN2 are known to mediate HUVEC adhesion through integrin αvβ3 (19Kireeva M.L. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3090-3096Google Scholar) and fibroblast adhesion through integrin α6β1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (8Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Google Scholar, 20Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Google Scholar). HUVEC adhesion to CCN3, as well as to FN or VN, was inhibited by EDTA and restored by the addition of Mg2+ or Ca2+ (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with the notion that divalent cation-dependent cell adhesion molecules, such as integrins, mediate cell adhesion to CCN3 (Fig. 2C). To define the specific integrins that might be involved, we investigated the inhibitory effect of RGD peptide. The GRGDSP peptide, but not the control GRGESP peptide, was able to partially block cell adhesion to CCN3 and completely block adhesion to VN (Fig. 2D), indicating the involvement of RGD-sensitive integrins. Since integrin αvβ3 is known to be inhibited by a relatively low concentration of RGD peptide (0.2 mm) as shown in Fig. 2D, we examined the role of this integrin. Cells were incubated with LM609, a mAb against integrin αvβ3, prior to plating. LM609 partially blocked HUVEC adhesion to CCN3 and VN but not to FN (Fig. 3B). We also tested the possible involvement of integrin α5β1 given its RGD sensitivity, even though no other CCN protein is known to bind this integrin. To our surprise, mAb against integrin α5β1 (JSB5) was also able to partially block HUVEC adhesion to CCN3 and FN (Fig. 3C). As expected, the same mAb had no effect on HUVEC adhesion to VN. These results indicate that both integrins α5β1 and αvβ3 play a role in HUVEC adhesion to CCN3. Since it was previously shown that CCN1 and CCN2 mediate adhesion of fibroblasts through integrin α6β1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans acting as co-receptors (8Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Google Scholar, 20Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Google Scholar), we investigated whether these two receptors also mediate HUVEC adhesion to CCN3. To investigate the potential role of integrin α6β1, cells were incubated with mAbs against either integrin α6 (GoH3) or β1 (P4C10) subunit prior to plating. These mAbs partially blocked adhesion to CCN3, indicating that integrin α6β1 also plays a role in HUVEC adhesion to CCN3 (Fig. 3A). As expected, these mAbs partially blocked cell adhesion to LN, which binds integrins α6β1 and α2β1, but not to VN, which binds αv integrins. Soluble heparin is known to block fibroblast adhesion to CCN1 and CCN2 by saturating the heparin binding sites located in the CT domain, thereby preventing them from binding cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (8Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Google Scholar, 20Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Google Scholar). Likewise, soluble heparin partially blocked HUVEC adhesion to CCN3, but not to FN or VN (Fig. 2D). Thus, it is likely that CCN3 may also engage heparan sulfate proteoglycans as a co-receptor when interacting with integrin α6β1. Given that antagonists of integrins αvβ3, α6β1, and α5β1 were able to partially inhibit HUVEC adhesion to CCN3, we tested whether the combination of antagonists of these integrins were sufficient to account for endothelial cell adhesion to CCN3. When cells were treated with GRGDSP peptide and soluble heparin, CCN3 adhesion was obliterated (Fig. 2D). In contrast, adhesion of the same cells to FN"

Using detergents and trypsin and micrococcal nuclease, we provide for the first time biochemical evidence for a double membrane compartment that encloses the replicative form (RF) RNA of the three pathogenic flaviviruses West Nile, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue viruses. The bounding membrane enclosing the VP was readily solubilized with nonionic detergents, rendering the catalytic amounts of enzymatically active protein component(s) of the replicase machinery partially sensitive to trypsin but allowing limited access for nucleases only to the vRNA and single-stranded tails of the replicative intermediate RNA. The RF co-sedimented at high speed from nonionic detergent extracts of virus-induced heavy membrane fractions along with the released individual inner membrane vesicles whose size of 75–100 nm as well as association with viral NS3 was revealed by immunoelectron microscopy. Viral RF remained nuclease-resistant even after ionic detergents solubilized the more refractory inner VP membrane. All of the viral RNA species became nuclease-sensitive following membrane disruption only upon prior trypsin treatment, suggesting that proteins coat the viral genomic RNA as well as RF within these membranous sites of flaviviral replication. These results collectively demonstrated that the newly formed viral genomic RNA associated with the VP are oriented outwards, while the RF is located inside the nonionic detergent-resistant vesicles.

Although replication of flaviviruses has been an extensively studied aspect, the precise mechanism adopted and intricate interactions among the factors involved are yet to be unraveled. The flavivirus genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA ∼11-kb long, lacking a 3′-poly(A) tail but with a 5′-type I cap. This genomic RNA upon uncoating utilizes the host translational machinery to direct synthesis of an ∼3,400 amino acid long polyprotein that is processed co-translationally and post-translationally by the host signalase and a virus-encoded proteinase to give three structural (capsid, premembrane/membrane, and envelope) and seven nonstructural (NS) 1The abbreviations used are: NS, nonstructural; ds, double-stranded; RF, replicative form; RI, replicative intermediates; RdRp, RNA polymerase; RC, replication complex; KUNV, Kunjin virus; DENV, dengue virus; CM, convoluted membranes; PC, paracrystalline arrays; VP, vesicle packets; JEV, Japanese encephalitis virus; WNV, West Nile virus; p.i., postinfection; MNase, micrococcal nuclease; TX100, Triton X-100; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DOC, sodium deoxycholate; SMS, smooth membrane vesicle-like structures; BMV, brome mosaic virus. proteins (NS1-NS5) (1Chambers T.J. Hahn C.S. Galler R. Rice C.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1990; 44: 649-688Google Scholar). The replication of the viral genome is thought to take place using putative complexes composed of viral as well as hypothetical host protein(s) (2Steffens S. Thiel H.J. Behrens S.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 2583-2590Google Scholar). This process is initiated by the synthesis of a negative strand RNA complementary to the viral genomic plus strand, resulting in a double-stranded (ds) replicative form (RF). Asymmetric and semi-conservative synthesis of RNA (3Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1985; 140: 68-79Google Scholar, 4Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1987; 157: 330-337Google Scholar) from the RF results in formation of replicative intermediates (RI) with nascent single-stranded RNA tails that resolve upon completion of strand synthesis to generate one molecule of single-stranded RNA and a RF. Two decades of scientific effort have revealed the putative and/or actual functions of most of the nonstructural proteins in the flavivirus life cycle. NS5, the largest of all of the viral proteins, functions as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (5Koonin E.V. Dolja V.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 375-430Google Scholar, 6Guyatt K.J. Westaway E.G. Khromykh A.A. J. Virol. Methods. 2001; 92: 37-44Google Scholar, 7Ackermann M. Padmanabhan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39926-39937Google Scholar) and a methyl transferase (8Egloff M.P. Benarroch D. Selisko B. Romette J.L. Canard B. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2757-2768Google Scholar), the latter implicating its role in capping of viral genomic RNA. The multifunctional protein NS3 manifests three activities. 1) The viral protease along with the cofactor NS2b is critical for proper processing of the viral polyprotein (9Falgout B. Pethel M. Zhang Y.M. Lai C.J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2467-2475Google Scholar, 10Jan L.R. Yang C.S. Trent D.W. Falgout B. Lai C.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 573-580Google Scholar, 11Chambers T.J. Nestorowicz A. Amberg S.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6797-6807Google Scholar). 2) A helicase is required most probably for unwinding dsRF (12Matusan A.E. Pryor M.J. Davidson A.D. Wright P.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9633-9643Google Scholar). 3) NTPase activity (13Kuo M.D. Chin C. Hsu S.L. Shiao J.Y. Wang T.M. Lin J.H. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2077-2084Google Scholar) presumably is required in the first step of capping the viral genomic RNA. The secreted NS1 protein is a soluble complement-binding factor for which a role in negative strand RNA synthesis has also been ascribed (14Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9608-9617Google Scholar). NS4a, an integral membrane protein, is believed to serve as a protein bridge between NS1 with which it specifically interacts (14Lindenbach B.D. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9608-9617Google Scholar) and the flaviviral replication complex (RC), thus tethering the RC with its numerous proteins to the membrane (15Westaway E.G. Mackenzie J.M. Kenney M.T. Jones M.K. Khromykh A.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6650-6661Google Scholar). The small hydrophobic protein NS2a has been shown to specifically bind the 3′-untranslated region and together with NS5 and NS3 that independently bind the same region has been hypothesized to seed the formation of RC (16Mackenzie J.M. Khromykh A.A. Jones M.K. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 203-215Google Scholar). Recent evidence has also revealed a surprising role for both NS3 and NS2a in virion morphogenesis (17Kummerer B.M. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4773-4784Google Scholar). The role of NS4b is debatable as it localized more in the nucleus than at the sites of replication (18Westaway E.G. Khromykh A.A. Kenney M.T. Mackenzie J.M. Jones M.K. Virology. 1997; 234: 31-41Google Scholar). The RNA-synthesizing machinery of virtually all of the eukaryotic cytoplasmic single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses including members of the togaviridae, flaviviridae, coronaviridae, arteriviridae, bromoviridae, and picornaviridae have been known to intimately engage the host intracellular membranes as platforms for viral replication (19Wimmer E. Hellen C.U. Cao X. Annu. Rev. Gen. 1993; 27: 353-436Google Scholar, 20Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Google Scholar). Cryo-immunoelectron microscopy carried out on cells infected with Kunjin virus (KUNV) and dengue virus (DENV) has revealed an extensive rearrangement of host-derived membranes leading to the development of distinct structures termed as convoluted membranes (CM) that reversibly form alternate structures called paracrystalline arrays (PC) (15Westaway E.G. Mackenzie J.M. Kenney M.T. Jones M.K. Khromykh A.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6650-6661Google Scholar, 21Mackenzie J.M. Jones M.K. Young P.R. Virology. 1996; 220: 232-240Google Scholar). In addition, present at the periphery of and closely associated with CM/PC are clusters of several small vesicles in close apposition with each other called vesicle packets (VP) (21Mackenzie J.M. Jones M.K. Young P.R. Virology. 1996; 220: 232-240Google Scholar). Although the VP and CM/PC represent distinct cellular compartments, they appear to be interconnected via the bounding of rough endoplasmic reticulum (22Mackenzie J.M. Jones M.K. Westaway E.G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9555-9567Google Scholar). The CM/PC originate from membranes derived from intermediate compartments and are presumed to be the site for proteolytic cleavage of the nascent polyprotein by the viral protease complex NS2b-NS3 located therein (15Westaway E.G. Mackenzie J.M. Kenney M.T. Jones M.K. Khromykh A.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6650-6661Google Scholar). The VP on the other hand are derived from membranes of the trans-Golgi network (22Mackenzie J.M. Jones M.K. Westaway E.G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9555-9567Google Scholar), and flaviviral replication is thought to ensue in tight association with the VP since the dsRF. which is presumably the template for viral RNA synthesis, was associated with these structures (15Westaway E.G. Mackenzie J.M. Kenney M.T. Jones M.K. Khromykh A.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6650-6661Google Scholar, 23Westaway E.G. Khromykh A.A. Mackenzie J.M. Virology. 1999; 258: 108-117Google Scholar). Furthermore, RdRp activity also predominantly localized to heavy membrane fractions that contained smooth membrane vesicle-like structures (SMS) (24Boulton R.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1976; 69: 416-430Google Scholar, 25Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Coia G. J. Virol. Methods. 1992; 37: 219-234Google Scholar), which may be synonymous with VP as noted earlier (26Mackenzie J.M. Khromykh A.A. Westaway E.G. Virology. 2001; 279: 161-172Google Scholar). Thus, while there exists extensive literature on ultrastructure of virus-induced membrane structures and the identity of the host organelle whence these membranes originate, there still persists a dearth of information pertaining to the architecture of flaviviral RC housed within these membranes. The protease sensitivity of the major flaviviral replicase proteins NS5 and NS3 had suggested a cytoplasmic orientation for the membrane bound RC (27Cauchi M.R. Henchal E.A. Wright P.J. Virology. 1991; 180: 659-667Google Scholar, 28Takegami T. Hotta S. Virus Res. 1989; 13: 337-350Google Scholar). In contrast, electron microscopic analysis carried out on KUNV-infected cells as well as DENV-infected cells displayed a dominant association of the RF as well as replicase proteins with membranous vesicle packets that were in turn enclosed by an outer membrane (15Westaway E.G. Mackenzie J.M. Kenney M.T. Jones M.K. Khromykh A.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6650-6661Google Scholar, 21Mackenzie J.M. Jones M.K. Young P.R. Virology. 1996; 220: 232-240Google Scholar). In keeping with these observations, we have earlier shown that extensive protease treatment of heavy membrane fractions from Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-infected cells did not compromise the in vitro RNA-dependent RdRp activity, despite effecting near-complete destruction of the major replicase proteins NS3 and NS5 (29Uchil P.D. Sachidanandam V. Virology. 2003; 307: 358-371Google Scholar). This result highlighted two important features of the flaviviral RC: 1) the presence of a bounding membrane that protects the enzymatically active replicase from protease action and 2) the requirement for only catalytic amounts of replicase proteins. In this study, we extend these observations for the flaviviruses West Nile virus (WNV) and DENV and also provide definitive biochemical proof using protease, detergents, and nuclease as tools for location of the flaviviral RNA species as well as viral replicase proteins behind a membrane barrier that encloses the RC. Our results also suggest that flaviviral RC are associated with differentially detergent-sensitive double layered vesicular structures wherein the newly formed vRNA is extruded into the intermembrane space while the RF remains protected inside the inner vesicular compartment, tightly associated with proteins. The implications of such an organization that confers differential accessibility for the viral RNA species to the host cell environment are discussed. Viruses and Cells—WNV strain E101, JEV strain P20778 (GenBank™ accession number AF080251), and DENV-2 strain TR 1751 (National Institute of Virology, Pune, India) were propagated in the Aedes albopictus cell line C6/36 (National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune, India) in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (Invitrogen), 0.22% NaHCO3, and 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.3). Confluent monolayers of C6/36 were infected with virus at a m.o.i. of 0.1 for routine expansion, and medium-containing virus was harvested at 5.5 days postinfection (p.i.), aliquoted, and stored at –80 °C until further use. The porcine kidney cell line PS (NCCS) maintained at 37 °C in minimum essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 was used to determine viral titers by the TCID50 method (30Gould E.A. Clegg J.C.S. Mahy B.W.J. Virology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1985: 43-78Google Scholar). These cells infected with WNV, JEV, or DENV at a m.o.i. of 10 were used as a source of viral RC 18–22 h p.i. Preparation of Flaviviral Replication Complexes and in Vitro RdRp Assay—Flavivirus-infected PS cells were harvested by centrifugation at 800 × g at 18–22 h p.i. and used to obtain heavy membrane fractions sedimenting at 16,000 × g (P16) as a source of RC in in vitro RdRp assays as previously described (4Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1987; 157: 330-337Google Scholar, 29Uchil P.D. Sachidanandam V. Virology. 2003; 307: 358-371Google Scholar). The in vitro RdRp assay, RNA extraction, and analysis using partially denaturing 7 m urea, 3% PAGE followed by autoradiography were carried out as described earlier (4Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1987; 157: 330-337Google Scholar). Results from lithium chloride fractionation and subsequent RNase A digestion of viral RNA species according to reported procedures (4Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1987; 157: 330-337Google Scholar, 29Uchil P.D. Sachidanandam V. Virology. 2003; 307: 358-371Google Scholar) showed that the RNA species produced in an in vitro RdRp assay using the P16 fraction from WNV- and DENV-infected cells are similar in their properties to those reported earlier for KUNV (31Westaway E.G. Adv. Virus Res. 1987; 33: 45-90Google Scholar) and JEV (29Uchil P.D. Sachidanandam V. Virology. 2003; 307: 358-371Google Scholar). We further confirmed the viral origin of the labeled RNA species generated during the in vitro assays by hybridization to unlabeled strand-specific viral RNA probes followed by RNase protection assays (29Uchil P.D.

The amount of each viral RNA species generated was estimated by scanning the gels on a Fuji BAS1000 phosphorimaging system and analyzed using the Fuji MacBAS V2.4 software. Metabolic Labeling of Proteins—Subconfluent monolayers of PS cells were mock or flavivirus-infected at a m.o.i. of 10. At 16 h p.i., the cells were labeled with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine-cysteine (1175.0 Ci/mmol, EXPRE35S35S, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (29Uchil P.D. Sachidanandam V. Virology. 2003; 307: 358-371Google Scholar). Protein samples after appropriate treatments were analyzed on SDS-10% PAGE. The gels were processed for fluorography using AMPLIFY™ (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions, dried, and exposed. Antisera specific to the NS3, NS5, NS1, and envelope proteins were used to confirm the identity of labeled proteins for JEV. In Vivo Labeling of Viral RNA—Mock- or flavivirus-infected (m.o.i. = 5) PS cells were labeled at 16 h p.i as described earlier (29Uchil P.D. Sachidanandam V. Virology. 2003; 307: 358-371Google Scholar) with 30 μCi/ml [32P]inorganic phosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h in the presence of 3 μg/ml actinomycin D. Homogenates were prepared from harvested cells and treated with micrococcal nuclease wherever required as described above. The extracted labeled viral RNA was resolved on a partially denaturing 7 m urea 3%-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Micrococcal Nuclease and Trypsin Treatments—P16 fractions from WNV, JEV, or DENV-infected cells were treated either before or after carrying out the RdRp assays with 15 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (MNase, MBI Fermentas) and 20 units/ml DNase I (Roche Applied Science) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 at 30 °C for 30 min. The treatments were terminated by adding EGTA (pH 8.0) to 5 mm and holding on ice for 30 min. Trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega Corporation) treatment was carried out on ice for 15 min at the concentrations mentioned and terminated using soybean trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) at final concentrations of 2 mg/ml and 1 mm respectively. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min for complete inactivation of trypsin before further processing. Detergent and Sodium Citrate Treatment of Virus-infected P16 Fractions—Detergent treatment of virus-infected P16 fractions was carried out at the appropriate concentrations on ice for 1 h. The nonionic detergent Triton X-100 (TX100) was used at a final concentration of 1% that has been reported to solubilize endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-like membranes (33Tata J.R. Hamilton M.J. Cole R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 67: 231-246Google Scholar), while the ionic detergent sodium deoxycholate (DOC) was used at a final concentration of 1.5%. Gentle disruption of ER and ER-like membranes was achieved using 1% sodium citrate at 4 °C for 30 min (34Gilchrist J.S. Pierce G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4291-4299Google Scholar). The protein concentration in the homogenates and P16 fractions during all of the treatments was maintained at 2 mg/ml. All of the detergents used were nuclease-free molecular biology grade obtained from Sigma. Floatation Analysis—The P16 fraction after in vitro RdRp assay from mock- and flavivirus-infected cells was subjected to 1% TX100 or 1.5% DOC at 4 °C for 1 h followed by sedimentation at 16,000 × g for 15 min to obtain S16 fractions, which were used for floatation analysis. 0.5 ml (2 × 106 cells) of the S16 fraction mixed with 4 ml of 75% (wt/wt) sucrose was layered on 0.5 ml of 80% (wt/wt) sucrose and overlaid with 4 ml of 55% (wt/wt) sucrose and 1 ml of 5% (wt/wt) sucrose in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm sodium acetate, and 1.5 mm MgCl2. Gradients were then centrifuged for 18 h at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman L8–80 model Ultracentrifuge using a SW41 Ti rotor at 4 °C, and 1-ml fractions were collected from the top and RNA was extracted and analyzed as mentioned above. Electron Microscopy of TX100-resistant Membrane Structures—Detergent-treated S16 fraction obtained as above was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 35,000 rpm (150,000 × g) for 5 h. The pellet (P150) obtained (detergent-resistant membrane fraction) was resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and deposited on Formvar-coated copper grids (Ted Pella Inc.) for 3 min and stained with 2% uranyl acetate in distilled water. The samples were visualized in a JEOL JEM-100CXII electron microscope operated at 80 kV. Immunoelectron microscopy of TX100-treated P150 fractions and first two fractions after floatation analysis, obtained as mentioned above from mock- and JEV-infected cells, were processed for low temperature embedding in LR Gold (Ted Pella Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions after fixing the samples with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (TAAB Laboratory Equipment) and 0.01% glutaraldehyde (EM grade, Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Ultra thin sections were then incubated at room temperature as follows: 2 h in PBG (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.5% (w/v) gelatin (from cold water fish skin, Sigma) and 0.05% (v/v) in Tween 20 (Sigma)); 3 h in polyclonal rabbit anti-JEV NS3 serum diluted 1: 4000 in PBG; 5 × 10 min in PBG; 2 h in anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) antibodies coupled to either 15- or 10 nm-gold (Ted Pella Inc.) diluted 1:100 in PBG; and 5 × 10 min in PBG. The conditions mentioned above were empirically standardized using sections obtained from mock-infected and infected whole cells embedded similarly. Only specific binding of antibodies (both primary and secondary) was observed under these conditions. The sections were then stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined as mentioned above. Flavivirus Replicase Proteins Are Required in Catalytic Amounts and Are Present Behind a Membrane Barrier—Extensive trypsin treatment of heavy membrane fractions from WNV and DENV-infected PS cells did not affect the in vitro RdRp activity (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3 for WNV and lanes 5 and 6 for DENV), despite the near complete destruction of the metabolically labeled major replicase proteins NS5 and NS3 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2 for WNV and lanes 5 and 6 for DENV). We interpreted this to suggest that trace amounts of NS5 and NS3 that are protected from trypsin digestion, probably by a membrane barrier(s), suffice to manifest the total detectable RdRp activity in these two flaviviruses that was similar to the properties of JEV RC previously demonstrated by us (29Uchil P.D. Sachidanandam V. Virology. 2003; 307: 358-371Google Scholar). The suggested existence of a membrane barrier was tested using the nonionic and ionic detergents TX100 and DOC, respectively. Trypsin digestion of TX100-treated membrane fractions from WNV and DENV decreased the RdRp activity by ∼50% (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–3 for WNV and lanes 4–6 for DENV) over and above the 30% reduction in activity observed due to the detergent treatment alone (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 2 for WNV and lanes 3 and 4 for DENV), indicating that TX100 caused vital protein components of RC to become partially exposed to trypsin. Specifically, decreased incorporation of label into vRNA and RI species was observed under these conditions (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 4), similar to that reported for KUNV (4Chu P.W. Westaway E.G. Virology. 1987; 157: 330-337Google Scholar). The total loss of vRNA in KUNV by this treatment could however be attributed to residual nuclease activity in cytoplasmic extracts used by these workers in contrast to the extensively washed heavy membrane fractions (P16) used by us, which reduces the burden of endogenous nuclease activity. Similar evaluation of the effect of trypsin on JEV RdRp after TX100 treatment could not be carried out because of the complete loss of activity suffered by JEV RC following detergent treatment alone (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6 (29Uchil P.D. Sachidanandam V. Virology. 2003; 307: 358-371Google Scholar). This could be attributed either to the greater inherent inhibition of JEV RC compared with WNV and DENV by TX100 or selective loss of one or more factors from JEV RC, possibilities that are under investigation. Whereas DOC treatment did not adversely affect RdRp activity (Fig. 1D, lanes 7, 10, and 13), it however led to a complete loss of activity when followed by trypsin in all of the three flaviviruses under study. This suggested complete solubilization of the membrane barrier(s) by the ionic detergent, thereby rendering the functional replicase proteins NS5 and NS3 accessible to trypsin. Since most of the detectable major replicase proteins were degraded even in intact membranes (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 6), the exact orientation of the enzymatically active replicase proteins within the associated membranes was difficult to ascertain. Flaviviral Replication Complexes Are Present in Micrococcal-Nuclease-resistant Compartments—In the next step of our analyses, we utilized flavivirus-induced membrane preparations from infected PS cells to ascertain the orientation of the three viral RNA species, namely RI, RF, and vRNA, in the membrane-bound RC based on sensitivity to a nonspecific nuclease such as MNase. MNase was the enzyme of choice over others such as RNase A since it is robust and, under the reaction conditions used, digests both single- and double-stranded nucleic acids. The strict dependence of its activity on the divalent cation calcium and consequent complete inactivation using EGTA made it possible to carry out RdRp assays after MNase treatment. The viral RNA species associated with membrane-bound RC can be oriented either toward the luminal space or the cytoplasmic compartment depending on their organization within the membrane. The susceptibility of some, all, or none of the three viral RNA species to MNase would thus help to decipher their organization within the membrane-bound RC. Exhaustive pretreatment of the membrane preparations from WNV-infected cells with MNase (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 5 and 6, and B, lanes 1 and 2) did not result in any reduction in RdRp activity, suggesting that those species of viral RNA that functioned as template(s) for RNA synthesis were not accessible to nucleases. In addition, MNase treatment at the end of the assay period revealed nuclease resistance of all of the three newly synthesized labeled viral RNA species that were generated during the in vitro reaction (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 3). The MNase resistance of viral RNAs was not due to their secondary structure and/or double stranded nature, because labeled viral RNA species added exogenously to infected cell P16 fractions were completely digested by MNase (Fig. 2A, lane 8). EtBr staining also confirmed the selective MNase resistance of all of the endogenous viral RNAs but not the host RNA within the infected cell (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3). Similar results were obtained for JEV and DENV RNA (Fig. 2B, lanes 4–6 and lanes 7–9, respectively). We also carried out in vivo labeling of viral RNAs using radiolabeled [32P]inorganic phosphate to assess the nuclease sensitivity profile of in vivo generated viral RNAs. Again, no reduction in the signal intensities due to the radiolabel in WNV, JEV, and DENV RNA species was evident following MNase treatment (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–6). In contrast, mock-infected cells processed similarly did not show presence of any MNase-resistant RNA species migrating in the gel (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 7 and 8). The residual label in these wells revealed the presence of nonspecific insoluble aggregates following these manipulations. Having thus confirmed that the properties of the in vitro and in vivo-labeled viral RNAs were similar, we confined the subsequent series of investigations to labeled RNA generated from in vitro RdRp assays. The observed nuclease resistance of flaviviral RNAs could be due either to a membrane barrier and/or proteins denying access to the RNA. We explored the potential role of proteins bound to viral RNA species in protecting them from degradation by performing trypsin digestion after the in vitro assay to degrade any bound proteins prior to MNase treatment. All of the three labeled WNV RNA species remained MNase-resistant, despite trypsin treatment (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–6). Activity of trypsin under these conditions was confirmed using actinomycin D-treated and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins from virus-infected cells as shown in Fig. 1B, lane 2. Similar nuclease resistance of all of the three JEV and DENV RNA species was also observed (data not shown). Thus, our results suggested that all of the three viral RNA species most probably reside in a membrane-enclosed and nuclease-resistant compartment that cannot be traversed or disrupted by trypsin in keeping with the trypsin resistance of the RdRp enzyme activity of the replication machinery. Nonionic Detergent Treatment Exposes Nascent vRNA to Nuclease Degradation—In a manner similar to that used for protein analysis of RC, we used detergents to study the nature of the membranous barrier if any that might confer nuclease resistance on the viral RNAs within the RC. We carried out RdRp assay using P16 fractions obtained from WNV-infected cells followed by nonionic detergent treatment with TX100. The subsequent MNase digestion rendered the single-stranded vRNA and the single-stranded nascent tails of RI sensitive to nuclease action (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 1 a"

Aβ is derived from the amyloid β-peptide precursor protein (β-APP) by the intramembranous cleavage activity of γ-secretase. Studies in cells have revealed that γ-secretase is a large multimeric membrane-bound protein complex that is functionally dependent on several proteins, including presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2. However, the precise biochemical and molecular nature of γ-secretase is as yet to be fully elucidated, and no investigations have analyzed γ-secretase in human brain. To address this we have developed a novel in vitro γ-secretase activity assay using detergent-solubilized cell membranes and a β-APP-derived fluorescent probe. We report that human brain-derived γ-secretase activity co-purifies with a high molecular weight protein complex comprising presenilin, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2. The inhibitor profile and solubility characteristics of brain-derived γ-secretase are similar to those described in cells, and proteolysis occurs at the Aβ40- and Aβ42-generating cleavage sites. The ability to isolate γ-secretase from post-mortem human brain may facilitate the identification of brain-specific modulators of β-APP processing and provide new insights into the biology of this important factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11039-11041Google Scholar). β-APP is initially cleaved by α- or β-secretase to generate membrane-bound C-terminal fragments (C83 or C99, respectively). The C83 and C99 polypeptides are substrates for intramembranous cleavage by γ-secretase, with Aβ generated from the longer C99 molecule. Aβ plaques typically develop within neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala regions of the brain. The reason for this regional specificity in plaque deposition is unknown. Two major forms of Aβ peptides are deposited in AD plaques, Aβ40 and Aβ42. The less abundant Aβ42 peptide species is more prone to aggregate into fibrils and is deposited early in the disease process (2Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 45-53Google Scholar, 3Näslund J. Haroutunian V. Mohs R. Davis K.L. Davies P. Greengard P. Buxbaum J.D. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2000; 283: 1571-1577Google Scholar). Aβ becomes toxic upon polymerization, and transgenic mice overexpressing Aβ develop AD-like lesions and show memory deficits. Also, genetic data implicate a role for Aβ in the pathogenesis of AD (4Golde T.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 11-18Google Scholar). Therefore, an obvious therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD is the use of agents that inhibit γ-secretase activity, thus reducing Aβ available for deposition. The majority of early-onset familial AD cases are associated with mutations in the presenilin (PS) genes, and all PS mutations cause an increase in the production of the amyloidogenic Aβ42 (5Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 217-224Google Scholar). PS plays a central role in γ-secretase activity (for review, see Refs. 6Holmes C. Br. J. Psychiatry. 2002; 180: 131-134Google Scholar and 7Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Google Scholar), but the precise molecular nature of this function in Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood. In the absence of PS, γ-secretase-mediated cleavage of β-APP is fully abolished (8Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Google Scholar), and some studies suggest that PS is a novel aspartyl protease with an activity profile identical to γ-secretase (9Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Moore C.L.

Other studies implicate PS as an indirect regulator of γ-secretase and hypothesized roles for PS in trafficking of the β-APP substrate to the site of cleavage or orientation of substrate within the membrane (14Haass C.

Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Google Scholar). As well as β-APP, substrates for γ-secretase-mediated regulated intramembrane proteolysis include Notch, the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4, and E-cadherin (18De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P.

Nicastrin, a transmembrane glycoprotein, was recently identified by co-immunoprecipitation with PS as part of this complex and was shown to be involved in Notch signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans and Aβ generation in human cells (25Yu G. Nishimura M. Arawaka S. Levitan D. Zhang L. Tandon A. Song Y.Q. Rogaeva E. Chen F. Kawarai T. Supala A. Levesque L. Yu H. Yang D.S. Holmes E. Milman P. Liang Y. Zhang D.M. Xu D.H. Sato C. Rogaev E.

The absence of nicastrin in Drosophila results in the destabilization and perturbation of both PS function and cellular localization (26Chung H.M. Struhl G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1129-1132Google Scholar, 27Hu Y. Ye Y. Fortini M.E. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 69-78Google Scholar). The nicastrin ectodomain undergoes a major structural alteration during assembly with presenilin, and this alteration is necessary for γ-secretase activity, suggesting that the nicastrin molecule is mechanistically central to the function of the γ-secretase complex (28Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Capell A. Schmitz J. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16474-16477Google Scholar). In addition to presenilin and nicastrin, the γ-secretase complex also contains two recently identified transmembrane proteins, namely Aph-1 and Pen-2. These proteins were initially identified in genetic screens in C. elegans (29Francis R. McGrath G. Zhang J. Ruddy D.A. Sym M. Apfeld J. Nicoll M. Maxwell M. Hai B. Ellis M.C. Parks A.L. Xu W. Li J.

A. 2002; 99: 775-779Google Scholar). Aph-1 is required for surface localization of nicastrin (30Goutte C. Tsunozaki M. Hale V.A. Priess J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 775-779Google Scholar), and Pen-2 is required for both the expression of PS and the maturation of nicastrin (31Steiner H. Winkler E. Edbauer D. Prokop S. Basset G. Yamasaki A. Kostka M. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39062-39065Google Scholar). Similarly, Aph-1 plays an intimate role in both the function and stabilization of the γ-secretase complex (32Lee S.F. Shah S. Li H. Yu C. Han W. Yu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45013-45019Google Scholar). More recent data in Drosophila and mammalian cells suggests that nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2 stabilize presenilin and increase the formation of presenilin fragments and γ-secretase activity. It is proposed, therefore, that Aph-1 stabilizes the presenilin holoprotein within the complex and Pen-2 is required for endoproteolysis of presenilin and activation of γ-secretase (33Luo W.J.

Thinakaran G. Iwatsubo T. Nature. 2003; 422: 438-441Google Scholar). The components described above are sufficient and necessary for γ-secretase activity (35Edbauer D. Winkler E. Regula J.T. Pesold B. Steiner H. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 486-488Google Scholar), but given the intricacies of the γ-secretase complex and the broad diversity of substrate- and cleavage-site specificity, it is possible that there are other functional or regulatory components of γ-secretase-mediated regulated intramembrane proteolysis. A first step in the characterization of γ-secretase has been to identify conditions for the solubilization of the complex and the development of activity assays. Several approaches have been applied to solubilize the γ-secretase complex. These have generally involved the use of membranes derived from cell lines, mild detergent treatments, and measurement of Aβ formation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blotting (23Li Y.M.

However, these approaches may not fully reflect γ-secretase-mediated processing of β-APP that occurs in the human brain. It is possible that the γ-secretase complex in brain contains brain- or neuronal-specific co-factors that modulate activity. The biochemical analysis of membrane-bound enzyme complexes from post-mortem brain is well established and has been applied to the investigation of enzyme activity in neurological disorders, including AD and schizophrenia (38Mitzen E.J. Barron K.D. Koeppen A.H. Harris H.W. Brain. Res. 1974; 68: 123-131Google Scholar, 39Maurer I. Zierz S. Moller H. Schizophr. Res. 2001; 48: 125-136Google Scholar). An attractive novel approach, therefore, is the analysis of γ-secretase in post-mortem non-AD and AD human brain isolates. As an initial step toward this aim, we describe the development of a sensitive in vitro γ-secretase assay based on a fluorogenic peptide probe. This assay system is dependent on the presence of PS, as described previously (8Zhang Z. Nadeau P. Song W. Donoviel D. Yuan M. Bernstein A. Yankner B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 463-465Google Scholar). We report the solubilization and characterization of γ-secretase from human brain and show that γ-secretase-mediated cleavage occurs at the putative γ-secretase site(s) within the β-APP amino acid sequence that results in the generation of Aβ. This activity is reduced by compounds previously shown to inhibit γ-secretase. In addition, we show that γ-secretase activity in human brain co-localizes with a high molecular weight protein complex that comprises PS1, nicastrin, Aph-1, and Pen-2. These findings provide the basis for the further characterization of γ-secretase and may facilitate the elucidation of essential factors in human brain involved in the pathobiology of AD. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: UD1 raised against the N-terminal residues ERVSNEEKLNL of Pen-2; Ab14 (Dr. Sam Gandy, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia) and NT-1 (Dr. P. Mathews, Nathan Kline Institute, New York), raised against human PS1-NTF; PS1-CTF (MAB5232, Chemicon) raised against the C-terminal loop region of human PS1; nicastrin (N1660, Sigma) raised against C-terminal residues 693–709 of human nicastrin; H2D-2, raised against human Aph-1 (Dr. Gang Yu, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Presenilin 1 Stable Cell Lines—The PS-deficient blastocyst derived mouse embryonic stem cells, BD8 (40Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. Hyslop P.S. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2.4 mm l-glutamine, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and nonessential amino acids. Site-specific recombination was achieved by mixing the gateway-compatible pCAG-IRESpuro vector (a gift from Dr. Stephen Wood and Poon-Yu Khut, Child Health Research Institute, Adelaide, Australia) and pEntr-human PS1 in the presence of LR clonase as per the manufacturer's instructions, creating the plasmid pCAG-PS1-IRESpuro. Transformants were selected on LB-ampicillin plates. BD8 cells were stably transfected with pCAG-PS1-IRESpuro and selected for 10 days in 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Surviving colonies were expanded and screened for PS1 overexpression by Western blotting. Membrane Isolation from Cells and Human Brain—Human brain material (2 g of temporal cortex, non-AD, ∼2 h post-mortem interval) was obtained from Huddinge Brain Bank (Huddinge, Sweden). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells and BD8 cells (∼2 × 108 cells/experiment) were propagated under standard conditions. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Brain pieces were kept on ice, dissected to remove blood vessels and white matter, and resuspended in buffer A (1 ml/0.2 g) containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Tissue was homogenized using a mechanical pestle-homogenizer (IKALaborteknik RW20; 1 500 rpm/25 strokes). Cells were harvested with a cell scraper, pelleted, and washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in 9 volumes of buffer A and homogenized using 15 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer with a B pestle. After homogenization, brain and cell lysates were processed under identical conditions. Lysates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to remove nuclei and large cell debris, and the pellet was rehomogenized as above. The resulting supernatants were pooled and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The membrane pellet was washed once in buffer A and recollected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. All centrifugations were carried out using a fixed-angle rotor. The membranes were resuspended in buffer A plus 10% glycerol, flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –70 °C before use. Solubilization of Membrane Preparations—Protein concentration in membrane preparations was determined using BCA reagents (Pierce). Membranes were resuspended (0.5 mg/ml) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% (w/v) CHAPSO (Calbiochem), and protease inhibitor mixture and solubilized at 4 °C for 1 h with end-over-end rotation. The solubilized membranes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatants were collected. γ-Secretase Inhibitors—The highly specific γ-secretase inhibitors L-685,458 (Bachem) and compound 1 (Dr. Mark Shearman, Merck Sharp and Dohme) and pepstatin A (Sigma), a more general aspartyl protease inhibitor, were dissolved in Me2SO, separated into aliquots, and stored at –70 °C until use. An inactive deshydroxy derivative of L-658,458 (synthesized by Dr. Alan Nadin, Merck Sharp and Dohme) was also used in this study. Deglycosylation—CHAPSO-solubilized membrane protein samples (50 μg) containing protease inhibitor mixture (as above) were denatured by boiling for 10 min at 100 °C in the presence of 0.5% (v/v) SDS and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. After cooling on ice, samples were adjusted to 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.5. For Endo H treatment, 100 milliunits of Endo H (Roche Applied Science) was added. For PNGase F treatment, Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and this was followed by the addition of 15.4 milliunits of PNGase F (Roche Applied Science). Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Glycosylation status was analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting and immunolabeling with nicastrin antibody. Immunoprecipitation—CHAPSO-solubilized membrane fractions were diluted with immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 0.5% CHAPSO). Samples were pre-cleared by the addition of 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and end-over-end rotation at 4 °C for 30 min. After incubation, samples were subjected to centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 2 min, and the supernatant was removed to a fresh tube. Antibodies were added to each tube, and incubation was continued overnight at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation. Protein A/G-Sepharose was added, and incubation was continued for 1–2 h. The beads were then isolated and washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.25% (w/v) CHAPSO. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the beads, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described below. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—Membrane preparations were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (10–20% Tricine gels, Novex). After electrophoresis proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) and probed with specific antibodies. Immune complexes were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences) was used for exposure, and films were scanned using an AGFA Duoscan. Figures were produced for publication with Photoshop (Adobe) or Canvas v.8 (Deneba Systems, Inc.) software. γ-Secretase-mediated Peptide Cleavage Assay—To measure γ-secretase activity, solubilized membranes (treatments, samples, and protein concentrations are indicated in individual experiments) were incubated at 37 °C in 150 μl of assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25% CHAPSO (w/v). Peptide substrate (Fig. 1A) was synthesized and purified by high performance liquid chromatography by Peptide Inc., Osaka, Japan. Solubilized membrane preparations were incubated with 8 μm peptide at 37 °C overnight, unless otherwise specified. After incubation, reactions were centrifuged at 16,100 × g for 15 min and placed on ice. Supernatants were transferred to a 96-well plate (Nunclon, Nunc), and fluorescence was measured using a plate reader (Fluorstar Galaxy) with excitation wavelength at 355 nm and emission wavelength at 440 nm. Analysis and presentation of results was carried out using Microsoft Excel software. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry—Samples from the γ-secretase assay containing solubilized membranes and peptide probe were injected onto a PLRP-S 300-Å (150 × 2.1 mm) reverse phase column (Polymer Laboratories). Water with 0.2% formic acid and acetonitrile with 0.2% formic acid was used as the mobile phase. The samples were eluted with a gradient from 10 to 40% acetonitrile over 30 min. The column was coupled on-line to an electrospray ion-trap mass spectrometer (Agilent 1100 series, Agilent Technologies). As a control, samples were also prepared in the absence of membranes. Blue Native (BN) PAGE—BN PAGE was performed by modification of methods described in Schülke et al. (41Schülke N. Vesanen M.S. Sanders R.W. Zhu P. Lu M. Anselma D.J. Villa A.R. Parren P.W. Binley J.M. Roux K.H. Maddon P.J. Moore J.P. Olson W.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7760-7776Google Scholar) and Brookes et al. (42Brookes P.S. Pinner A. Ramachandran A. Coward L. Barnes S. Kim H. Darley-Usmar V.M. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 969-977Google Scholar). All buffers and solutions were pH 7.0 at 4 °C. Membranes (∼0.5 mg of protein) were prepared as described above and resuspended in 100 μlof extraction buffer composed of aminocaproic acid (0.75 m) and BisTris (50 mm). 12.5 μl of n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (10% w/v, Calbiochem) was added to the suspension. After incubation on ice for 20 min with vortexing every 5 min, samples were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min, and protein concentration was quantified. To 100 μl of supernatant, 6.3 μl of a 5% suspension of Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 in aminocaproic acid (0.5 m) was added. Samples (30-μl aliquots containing ∼50 μg of protein) were loaded onto a 4–12% BisTris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen). Molecular weight standards (high molecular weight calibration kit, Amersham Biosciences) were resuspended in extraction buffer (200 μl per 250-μg vial) plus 25 μl of 10% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and 12 μl of 5% Coomassie Blue, as above. Gel electrophoresis was performed overnight at 75 V using 50 mm Tricine, 15 mm BisTris, 0.02% Coomassie Blue G-250 as cathode buffer, and 50 mm BisTris as anode buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were equilibrated for 30 min in Western blot transfer buffer containing 0.05% (w/v) SDS. The samples were transferred to PVDF membrane as described above, except that transfer buffer contained 0.05% SDS. Size Exclusion Chromatography—The solubilized membrane preparation (∼300 μg of protein) was injected onto a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences). Solubilization buffer with 0.25% CHAPSO was used as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min, and 0.4-ml fractions were collected and assayed for activity. The protein content of selected fractions was concentrated using Strataclean™ resin (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. Development of an in Vitro Presenilin-dependent γ-Secretase Assay—We designed an intramolecularly quenched fluorescent peptide probe containing the C-terminal β-APP amino acid sequence that is cleaved by γ-secretase (Fig. 1A). Membranes were prepared from PS null BD8 cells or BD8 cells stably transfected with a human PS1 overexpression plasmid. γ-Secretase-mediated cleavage of both β-APP and Notch has been shown to be rescued in these cells by transfection of PS1 (8Zhang Z.

Donoviel D. Lendahl U. Honjo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4014-4019Google Scholar). Recently published methods were used to solubilize a crude membrane fraction from both cell lines (23Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Google Scholar), and γ-secretase mediated processing of the peptide probe was analyzed by measuring fluorescence after incubating solubilized membranes at 37 °C in the absence or presence of the transition state analogue γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 (13Shearman M.S. Beher D. Clarke E.E. Lewis H.D. Harrison T. Hunt P. Nadin A. Smith A.L. Stevenson G. Castro J.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8698-8704Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Peptide cleavage occurs in the presence of PS1, and this activity is inhibited by ∼45% in the presence of L-685,458. Background activity is observed in the absence of PS1, and possible explanations for this phenomenon are discussed later. A slight decrease in activity in the PS null background was also observed in the presence of L-685,458, and this may arise from the inhibition of a nonspecific protease due to the high molar excess of the inhibitor used in this experiment. These data suggested that this system could be used to measure PS-dependent γ-secretase activity and encouraged us to carry out further investigations. Solubilized Membranes Isolated from Post-mortem Human Brain Can Cleave the Peptide Probe—After the development of a sensitive in vitro assay we first sought to establish whether cleavage of the peptide probe was comparable with that seen using solubilized membranes from freshly isolated cultured human cells. Initially, cell membranes were prepared from human embryonic kidney 293 cells and temporal cortex to compare activities. After solubilization and quantification of protein content, samples with equal amounts of protein were incubated overnight with the peptide probe. The activities from the different membrane preparations were compared (Fig. 2A). Maximal activity was obtained from the human embryonic kidney 293 cell membranes, whereas γ-secretase activity from brain membranes was ∼20% lower. Activity increased in a time-(Fig. 2B) and protein concentration-dependent (Fig. 2C) manner. Control samples without membranes showed a slight increase in signal in the presence of peptide, probably due to hydrolysis of the probe (Fig. 2, A and B). The membrane fraction has some autofluorescence (Fig. 2A), and this signal is subtracted from subsequent readings. The Peptide Probe Is Cleaved at the Aβ40- and Aβ42-generating Sites—The peptide cleavage products generated during the incubation were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (shown in Table I). N- and C-terminal peptide cleavage products were observed corresponding to the Aβ42 cleavage site (Nma-GGVVIA and TVK(Dnp)rrr-NH2), whereas only N-terminal products were detected corresponding to the Aβ40 cleavage (Nma-GGVV). This suggests that a specific protease was active in the crude membrane fraction, generating cleavage products corresponding to both Aβ40 and Aβ42.Table IFragments detected by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry after incubation of solubilized membranes with peptide probeN-terminal fragmentsm/zC-terminal fragmentsm/zNma-GGVV464.3NDNma-GGVVI577.3NDNma-GGVVIA648.4TVK(Dnp)rrr-NH2980.6Nma-GGVVIAT749.4VK(Dnp)rrr-NH2879.5 Open table in a new tab γ-Secretase Is Active in Brain-derived Solubilized Membranes—The peptide probe is cleaved in the presence of the solubilized membrane fraction, and peptide fragments corresponding the C termini of Aβ are generated.

Runx2-deficient (Runx2–/–) mice showed a complete lack of bone formation because of maturational arrest of osteoblasts and disturbed chondrocyte maturation. Further, osteoclasts were absent in these mice, in which OPG and macrophage-colony stimulating factor were normally expressed, but RANKL expression was severely diminished. We investigated the function of Runx2 in osteoclast differentiation. A Runx2–/– calvaria-derived cell line (CA120–4), which expressed OPG strongly but RANKL barely, severely suppressed osteoclast differentiation from normal bone marrow cells in co-cultures. Adenoviral introduction of Runx2 into CA120–4 cells induced RANKL expression, suppressed OPG expression, and restored osteoclast differentiation from normal bone marrow cells, whereas the addition of OPG abolished the osteoclast differentiation induced by Runx2. Addition of soluble RANKL (sRANKL) also restored osteoclast differentiation in co-cultures. Forced expression of sRANKL in Runx2–/– livers increased the number and size of osteoclast-like cells around calcified cartilage, although vascular invasion into the cartilage was superficial because of incomplete osteoclast differentiation. These findings indicate that Runx2 promotes osteoclast differentiation by inducing RANKL and inhibiting OPG. As the introduction of sRANKL was insufficient for osteoclast differentiation in Runx2–/– mice, however, our findings also suggest that additional factor(s) or matrix protein(s), which are induced in terminally differentiated chondrocytes or osteoblasts by Runx2, are required for osteoclastogenesis in early skeletal development.

In the process of endochondral ossification, chondrocytes mature to hypertrophic chondrocytes, matrix around terminally differentiated chondrocytes (terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes) is mineralized, blood vessels invade into the calcified cartilage, and cartilage is replaced by bone (1Gilbert S.F. Developmental Biology. 5th Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., City, MA1997Google Scholar). Osteoclasts accelerate these processes by resorption of the calcified matrix leading to bone marrow formation.

Runx2–/– mice completely lack bone formation because of the maturational arrest of osteoblasts, indicating that Runx2 is an essential factor for osteoblast differentiation (23Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1997; 89: 755-764Google Scholar, 24Otto F.

In addition, chondrocyte maturation is also disturbed in Runx2–/– mice (25Inada M. Yasui T. Nomura S. Miyake S. Deguchi K. Himeno M. Sato M. Yamagiwa H. Kimura T. Yasui N. Ochi T. Endo N. Kitamura Y. Kishimoto T. Komori T. Dev. Dyn. 1999; 214: 279-290Google Scholar, 26Kim I.S. Otto F. Zabel B. Mundlos S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 159-170Google Scholar), and Runx2 has been shown to be an important factor for chondrocyte maturation (27Enomoto H. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Iwamoto M. Nomura S. Himeno M. Kitamura Y. Kishimoto T. Komori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8695-86702Google Scholar, 28Ueta C. Iwamoto M. Kanatani N. Yoshida C. Liu Y. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Ohmori T. Enomoto H. Nakata K. Takada K. Kurisu K. Komori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 87-100Google Scholar, 29Takeda S. Bonnamy J.P. Owen M.J. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 467-481Google Scholar). Although chondrocytes had matured, and the matrix was mineralized in restricted parts of the skeleton of Runx2–/– mice, osteoclasts were completely absent, and no vascular invasion into the calcified cartilage occurs (23Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1997; 89: 755-764Google Scholar). Therefore, Runx2 plays important roles in multiple processes of endochondral ossification, including chondrocyte maturation, vascular invasion into the cartilage, osteoclast differentiation, and osteoblast differentiation (30Komori T. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 87: 1-8Google Scholar). We have shown that Runx2–/– calvaria-derived cells have less ability to support osteoclast differentiation from normal spleen cells, and RANKL expression is severely diminished in Runx2–/– mice, suggesting that Runx2 is involved in osteoclastogenesis through the regulation of RANKL expression in osteoblastic/stromal cells (31Gao Y.H. Shinki T. Yuasa T. Kataoka-Enomoto H. Komori T. Suda T. Yamaguchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 697-702Google Scholar). However, Runx2 binding elements are also present in the promoter region of OPG, and Runx2 increased the activity of the OPG promoter, suggesting that Runx2 inhibits osteoclast differentiation and activation through OPG induction (32Thirunavukkarasu K. Halladay D.L. Miles R.R. Yang X. Galvin R.J. Chandrasekhar S. Martin T.J. Onyia J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25163-25172Google Scholar). Further, Runx2 failed to stimulate the transcriptional activity of the 0.7-kb 5′-flanking region of the RANKL gene (33O'Brien C.A. Kern B. Gubrij I. Karsenty G. Manolagas S.C. Bone. 2002; 30: 453-462Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of Runx2 in osteoclast differentiation remains to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of Runx2 in RANKL and OPG expression and osteoclast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Runx2 induced RANKL expression and suppressed OPG expression in vitro, leading to the promotion of osteoclast differentiation. Further, overexpression of soluble RANKL (sRANKL) partially rescued the blockage of osteoclast differentiation in Runx2–/– mice, indicating the involvement of Runx2 in osteoclastogenesis by regulating RANK-RANKL signaling. Establishment of Calvaria-derived Runx2–/–Cell Lines—Runx2+/– mice (23Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1997; 89: 755-764Google Scholar) were mated with p53–/– mice (34Gondo Y. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Sasaoka T. Ito K. Kimura M. Katsuki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 830-837Google Scholar) to generate Runx2+/–p53–/– mice. Runx2–/–p53–/– mice were generated by mating Runx2+/–p53–/– mice. Calvarial cells derived from E18.5 Runx2–/–p53–/– embryos were prepared and cultured as described previously (35Kobayashi H. Gao Y.H. Ueta C. Yamaguchi A. Komori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 630-636Google Scholar). Colonies of the calvarial cells were isolated by digestion with trypsin/EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C within stainless steel cloning rings. Isolated cells were then expanded and recloned by limiting dilution. Prior to the study, all experiments were reviewed and approved by Osaka University Medical School Animal Care and Use Committee. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cellular samples using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of 20 μg of total RNA were separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto nylon membrane filters. A 1.5-kb fragment of mouse RANKL cDNA (8Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K.

A. 1998; 95: 3597-3602Google Scholar), a 1.5-kb fragment of OPG cDNA (4Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Mochizuki S. Yano K. Fujise N. Sato Y. Goto M. Yamaguchi K. Kuriyama M. Kanno T. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T. Higashio K. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1329-1337Google Scholar), and mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA (36Himeno M. Enomoto H. Liu W. Ishizeki K. Nomura S. Kitamura Y. Komori T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1297-1305Google Scholar) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Megaprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridization was performed as described previously (27Enomoto H. Enomoto-Iwamoto M. Iwamoto M. Nomura S. Himeno M. Kitamura Y. Kishimoto T. Komori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8695-86702Google Scholar). The intensities of RANKL, OPG, and GAPDH bands were quantitated by densitometry using FMBIO analysis software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Construction of Adenovirus—A mouse cDNA containing the entire open reading frame of Runx2 (37Liu W. Toyosawa S. Furuichi T. Kanatani N. Yoshida C. Liu Y. Himeno M. Narai S. Yamaguchi A. Komori T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 157-166Google Scholar) was inserted into the BamHI site of pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech), and a DNA fragment containing Runx2, internal ribosome entry site, and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) was inserted into the BamHI-XbaI sites of pACCMV.pLpA shuttle vector (38Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Google Scholar). The constructed vector was co-transfected with the adenovirus cloned plasmid pJM17 (39McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Google Scholar) into human kidney 293 cells by the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A recombinant adenovirus was generated by homologous recombination events between the two plasmids. Amplified crude viral stocks were purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation and used for the infection. The recombinant adenovirus carrying only internal ribosome entry site-EGFP was also generated and used for the control infection. Adenoviral Introduction of Runx2 into CA120–4 Cells—CA120–4 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/dish in collagen-coated 60-mm plates (Iwaki Glass, Chiba, Japan). On the following day, cells were infected with either EGFP-expressing (control) or Runx2- and EGFP-expressing virus. After the viral infection, cells were cultured with or without 1α,25(OH)2D3 and harvested for RNA extraction. Osteoclast Differentiation in Vitro—CA120–4 cells were inoculated in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well. Twenty-four h after plating, cells were infected by either EGFP-expressing (control) or Runx2- and EGFP-expressing virus for 2 h. Thereafter, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to eliminate adenovirus and subsequently cultured with bone marrow cells (2 × 105 cells/well) in α-minimum Eagle's medium (0.5 ml/well) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10–8m 1α,25(OH)2D3. Cultures were fed every 3 days by replacing 0.4 ml of old medium with fresh medium (40Suda T. Jimi E. Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Metods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 223-235Google Scholar). Recombinant human OPG and sRANKL proteins (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were administrated at a final concentration of 100 and 30 ng/ml, respectively. On the seventh day of the co-culture, adherent cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, treated with ethanol-acetone (50:50), and stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using the acid phosphatase, leukocyte kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of proteins (20 μg) were separated on a 10% gel by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking the membrane with 5% skimmed milk, the membrane was incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody against Runx2 (41Lee K.S. Kim H.J. Li Q.L. Chi X.Z. Ueta C. Komori T. Wozney J.M. Kim E.G. Choi J.Y Ryoo H.M. Bae S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8783-8792Google Scholar) at a 1:300 dilution and then with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Bound antibody was visualized by an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Generation of Runx2–/–tg Mice—sRANKL transgenic mice were generated using the hSAP (human serum amyloid P component) gene promoter (42Yoshimoto T. Wang C.R. Yoneto T. Waki S. Sunaga S. Komagata Y. Mitsuyama M. Miyazaki J. Nariuchi H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 588-594Google Scholar) and a sRANKL DNA fragment containing immunoglobulin κ-chain leader sequence and the extracellular domain sequence of RANKL (murine RANKL residue 71–316) (43Mizuno A. Kanno T. Hoshi M. Shibata O. Yano K. Fujise N. Kinosaki M. Yamaguchi K. Tsuda E. Murakami A. Yasuda H. Higashio K. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2002; 20: 337-344Google Scholar). The sRANKL transgenic mice were mated with Runx2+/– mice to generate Runx2+/– sRANKL transgenic mice. Runx2–/– sRANKL transgenic (Runx2–/–tg) mice were generated by mating Runx2+/–sRANKL transgenic mice with Runx2+/– mice. Genotypes were determined by Southern blot analysis for Runx2 and PCR analysis for sRANKL, as described previously (23Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M. Sato M. Okamoto R. Kitamura Y. Yoshiki S. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1997; 89: 755-764Google Scholar, 43Mizuno A. Kanno T. Hoshi M. Shibata O. Yano K. Fujise N. Kinosaki M. Yamaguchi K. Tsuda E. Murakami A. Yasuda H. Higashio K. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2002; 20: 337-344Google Scholar). Serum sRANKL level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against mouse RANKL (44Tsukii K. Shima N. Mochizuki S. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Yano K. Shibata O. Udagawa N. Yasuda H. Suda T. Higashio K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 337-341Google Scholar). Histological Examination—Tissue preparation was performed as described previously (45Hoshi K. Komori T. Ozawa H. Bone. 1999; 25: 639-651Google Scholar). In brief, E18.5 embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for paraffin sections, and a mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.067 m (pH 7.4) cacodylate buffer for epoxyresin sections. Decalcified 3–5-μm paraffin sections of tibiae were used for hematoxylin and eosin staining or TRAP activity. For histomorphometric analysis, bone volumes were measured at the diaphyses of tibiae (from 345 μm below the proximal growth plates to 460 μm beyond the distal growth plates), using a semiautomated system (Bone Histomorphometric System; System Supply, Nagano, Japan). Nomenclature, symbols, and units used are those recommended by the Nomenclature Committee of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (46Parfitt A.M. Drezner M.K. Glorieux F.H. Kanis J.A. Malluche H. Meunier P.J. Ott S.M. Recker R.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1987; 2: 595-610Google Scholar). For electron-microscopic analysis, following post-fixation with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), the tibiae were embedded in Poly/Bed 812 resin and sliced into 60–80-nm sections. These sections were observed under a transmission electron microscope (H-7100; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) after staining with tannic acid, uranylacetate, and lead citrate. Establishment of Runx2–/–Cell Line, CA120–4—We showed previously (35Kobayashi H. Gao Y.H. Ueta C. Yamaguchi A. Komori T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 630-636Google Scholar) that Runx2–/– calvarial cells are able to differentiate into adipocytes spontaneously and into chondrocytes with BMP-2. We isolated 93 clones from the calvarial cells of Runx2–/–p53–/– mice. Each cell line had its own characteristics with regard to capacity to differentiate into either chondrocytes or adipocytes. In all of the Runx2–/– cell lines, RANKL expression was barely detectable, but OPG expression was clearly detected by Northern blot analysis, and one of the cell lines (CA120–4) was used for the following experiments (Fig. 1A) (data not shown). This cell line lacked the ability to differentiate into chondrocytes or adipocytes, but alkaline phosphatase activity was induced by BMP-2 treatment (data not shown). Consistent with the expression levels of RANKL and OPG in CA120–4 cells, osteoclast differentiation was severely inhibited in the co-culture of CA120–4 cells and normal bone marrow cells (Fig. 1B). Runx2 Induces RANKL Expression and Promotes Osteoclast Differentiation—To clarify the role of Runx2 in the regulation of RANKL expression and osteoclastogenesis, we introduced the Runx2 gene into CA120–4 cells by adenoviral gene transfer. We first confirmed that the infected cells produced Runx2 protein by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig 2A, a band of about 57 kDa detected in the Runx2 virus-infected cells corresponded to that in endogenous Runx2 in ATDC5 cells, which were used as a positive control. Adenoviral introduction of the Runx2 gene clearly induced RANKL expression in the presence of 1α,25(OH)2D3, and the induction was already apparent at 24 h after infection and continued for at least 6 days, whereas the induction was never observed in the control virus-infected cultures even in the presence of 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 2, B and C). In the absence of 1α,25(OH)2D3, however, Runx2 failed to induce RANKL expression. 1α,25(OH)2D3 suppressed OPG expression as described previously (31Gao Y.H. Shinki T. Yuasa T. Kataoka-Enomoto H. Komori T. Suda T. Yamaguchi A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 697-702Google Scholar), but the introduction of Runx2 gene suppressed OPG expression at 24 h after infection without 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 2, B and D). The 1α,25(OH)2D3-independent suppression of OPG by Runx2 was not apparent at 3 days after infection, but Runx2 and 1α,25(OH)2D3 synergistically reduced OPG expression for at least 6 days. Although the presence of CA120–4 cells completely suppressed osteoclast differentiation of normal bone marrow cells (Fig. 1B), the introduction of Runx2 into CA120–4 cells restored the formation of TRAP-positive osteoclast-like cells from the bone marrow cells (Fig. 3, B and F). However, the addition of OPG abolished the induction of TRAP-positive osteoclast-like cells by the introduction of Runx2 (Fig. 3, C and F). These data indicate that Runx2 induces osteoclast differentiation through RANK-RANKL signaling. To confirm the functional involvement of RANKL in this co-culture system, we administered sRANKL and examined the effects on the formation of TRAP-positive osteoclast-like cells (Fig. 3, D and E). In the presence of CA120–4 cells, sRANKL also restored the formation of TRAP-positive osteoclast-like cells from normal bone marrow cells (Fig. 3E), indicating that RANKL can overcome the inhibitory effect of CA120–4 cells on osteoclast differentiation. Thus, these findings indicate that Runx2 promotes osteoclast differentiation by inducing RANKL expression and inhibiting OPG expression. Generation of Runx2–/–Mice with sRANKL Transgene— Our in vitro studies indicated that RANKL was a downstream gene of Runx2 and RANKL mediated osteoclast differentiation in the absence of Runx2. Thus, we next asked whether RANKL could induce osteoclast differentiation in Runx2–/– mice. Overexpression of sRANKL under the control of the chicken β-actin promoter and cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer, which direct the expression from an early developmental stage, resulted in mortality at the perinatal stage (43Mizuno A. Kanno T. Hoshi M. Shibata O. Yano K. Fujise N. Kinosaki M. Yamaguchi K. Tsuda E. Murakami A. Yasuda H. Higashio K. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2002; 20: 337-344Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated another transgenic mouse, which overexpressed sRANKL under the control of the hSAP promoter (42Yoshimoto T. Wang C.R. Yoneto T. Waki S. Sunaga S. Komagata Y. Mitsuyama M. Miyazaki J. Nariuchi H. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 588-594Google Scholar). The transgene under the control of this promoter was expressed in the liver, and its expression increased at the post-natal stage (47Zhao X. Araki K. Miyazaki J. Yamamura K. J. Biochem. 1992; 111: 736-738Google Scholar), resulting in an osteoporotic phenotype in adulthood (43Mizuno A. Kanno T. Hoshi M. Shibata O. Yano K. Fujise N. Kinosaki M. Yamaguchi K. Tsuda E. Murakami A. Yasuda H. Higashio K. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2002; 20: 337-344Google Scholar). The sRANKL transgenic mice were mated with Runx2+/– mice and then Runx2–/–tg mice were generated. Because the activity of the hSAP promoter at the embryonic stage was lower than in adults, we injected CCl4 into pregnant mice with embryos at embryonic day (E) 14.5–15.5 to induce acute inflammation and activate the promoter during the embryonic stage. The treatment enhanced the expression of sRANKL in the livers of transgenic embryos but not of wild-type embryos (Fig. 4A), and the serum sRANKL levels in the transgenic embryos were equivalent to the concentrations we used for in vitro culture (Table I). The trabecular bones of sRANKL transgenic mice were decreased, and the number of TRAP-positive cells was increased with large multinucleated cells (Fig. 4, B–G). Histomorphometric analysis using E18.5 tibias showed that the induction of sRANKL in fetal liver resulted in 40% decrease of bone mass and more than one-third increase of osteoclast surface and number (Fig. 4, H–J). These findings indicate that sRANKL expression in the embryos was enough for the promotion of osteoclast differentiation and activation.Table ISerum concentration of sRANKLGenotypensRANKL concentration (mean ± S.D.)ng/mlsRANKLtg1645.0 ± 6.9Runx2-/- tg535.3 ± 8.9Wild-type8NDRunx2-/-4ND Open table in a new tab Forced Expression of sRANKL Promoted Osteoclast Differentiation but Failed to Induce Fully Differentiated Osteoclasts in Runx2–/–Mice—At E18.5, a few"
https://openalex.org/W1992847318,"Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27Kip1 binds to the cyclin E·CDK2 complex and plays a major role in controlling cell cycle and cell growth. Our group and others have reported that anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies exert inhibitory effects on HER2-overexpressing breast cancers through G1 cell cycle arrest associated with induction of p27Kip1 and reduction of CDK2. The role of p27Kip1 in anti-HER2 antibody-induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition is, however, still uncertain. Here we have provided several lines of evidence supporting a critical role for p27Kip1 in the anti-HER2 antibody-induced G1 cell cycle arrest and tumor growth inhibition. Induction of p27Kip1 and G1 growth arrest by anti-HER2 antibody, murine 4D5, or humanized trastuzumab (Herceptin®) are concentration-dependent, time-dependent, irreversible, and long-lasting. The magnitude of G1 cell cycle arrest induced by trastuzumab or 4D5 is well correlated with the level of p27Kip1 protein induced. Up-regulation of p27Kip1 and G1 growth arrest could no longer be removed with as little as 14 h of treatment with trastuzumab. Anti-HER2 antibody-induced p27Kip1 protein, G1 arrest, and growth inhibition persist at least 5 days after a single treatment. The magnitude of growth inhibition of breast cancer cells induced by anti-HER2 antibody closely parallels the level of p27Kip1 induced. Induced expression of exogenous p27Kip1 results in a p27Kip1 level-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition similar to that obtained with anti-HER2 antibodies. Reducing p27Kip1 expression using p27Kip1 small interfering RNA blocks anti-HER2 antibody-induced p27Kip1 up-regulation and G1 arrest. Treatment with anti-HER2 antibody significantly increases the half-life of p27Kip1 protein. Inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, but not inhibition of calpain and caspase activities, up-regulates p27Kip1 protein to a degree comparable with that obtained with anti-HER2 antibodies. We have further demonstrated that anti-HER2 antibody significantly decreases threonine phosphorylation of p27Kip1 protein at position 187 (Thr-187) and increases serine phosphorylation of p27Kip1 protein at position 10 (Ser-10). Expression of S10A and T187A mutant p27Kip1 protein increases the fraction of cells in G1 and reduces a further antibody-induced G1 arrest. Consequently, p27Kip1 plays an important role in the anti-HER2 antibody-induced G1 cell cycle arrest and tumor growth inhibition through post-translational regulation. Regulation of the phosphorylation of p27Kip1 protein is one of the post-translational mechanisms by which anti-HER2 antibody upregulates the protein."

Whereas RNA is the physiological substrate of APOBEC1, recent experiments have strongly indicated that, when expressed in bacteria, APOBEC1 and some of its homologues can deaminate cytosine in DNA. Indeed, genetic evidence demonstrates that the physiological function of activation-induced deaminase, a B lymphocyte-specific APOBEC1 homologue, is to perform targeted deamination of cytosine within the immunoglobulin locus, thereby triggering antibody gene diversification. However, biochemical evidence of in vitro DNA deamination by members of the APOBEC family is still needed. Here, we show that deamination of cytosine to uracil in DNA can be achieved in vitro using partially purified APOBEC1 from extracts of transformed Escherichia coli. Thus, APOBEC1 can deaminate cytosine in both RNA and DNA. Strikingly, its activity on DNA is specific for single-stranded DNA and exhibits dependence on local sequence context.

Deamination of cytosine to uracil can occur in vivo at the level of nucleotide, in RNA and in DNA. Thus, enzyme-catalyzed deamination of cytidylate to uridylate and of dCTP to dUTP plays a key role in nucleotide metabolism, underpinning the pathway of de novo thymidylate synthesis (1Kornberg A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA1980Google Scholar). In the context of RNA, the major physiological example of programmed cytosine deamination in mammals is the tissue-specific editing of the transcript encoding apolipoprotein B. This editing is performed by a complex comprising APOBEC1, a zinc-binding protein showing homology to cytidine deaminases of bacteria and other organisms (2Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Pease R.J.

In the context of DNA, the low level deamination of cytosine to uracil, which takes place spontaneously (and which might be of relatively minor significance when it occurs with free nucleotides or in mRNA), can have major effects, contributing to genome mutation, cancer, and evolution (6Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). Indeed, such DNA deamination is the focus of a specific base-excision repair pathway. Recent work has now provided strong genetic evidence that deamination of cytosine can also occur in DNA as part of a physiological program. Thus, it appears that deamination of dC → dU within the immunoglobulin loci is triggered by AID 1The abbreviations used are: AID, activation-induced deaminase; APOBEC1, apolipoprotein B-editing complex catalytic subunit 1; UDG, uracil-DNA glycosylase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight.

Furthermore, several members of the APOBEC family (including APOBEC1 itself) when expressed in bacteria appear to cause mutation through deamination of cytosine in DNA (10Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Harris R.S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 418: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 13Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol.

Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), the genetic evidence very strongly indicates that the APOBEC family members themselves are intimately involved in the DNA deamination reaction. Thus, the mutations generated by APOBEC family members are all transitions at dC:dG with the frequency and nature of the nucleotide substitutions affected by deficiency in uracil-DNA glycosylase. Furthermore, the local sequence context of the dC residue targeted for mutation differs between APOBEC family members (10Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Harris R.S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 418: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 13Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there is a need for biochemical evidence that APOBEC family members can trigger such deamination in vitro, not merely to confirm the predictions of the genetic analyses but also so as to facilitate investigation into the kinetics, substrate specificity, and characteristics of the deamination reaction. Here, we describe an important step in that direction and show that the substrate for the deamination is single-stranded DNA and affected by local sequence context. Plasmids and Bacteria—The pTrc99- and pET-based expression vectors for rat APOBEC1 and its Glu63 → Ala mutant, for human APOBEC2 and for Escherichia coli dCTP deaminase as well as the E. coli host strains have been described previously (10Petersen-Mahrt S.K.

The culture was chilled on ice for 20 min and then incubated with aeration for 16 h at 16 °C in the presence of inducer (1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 20 ml H buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). Following sonication and ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 45 min), the supernatant was passed through a 0.2-μm filter and applied to a Sepharose fast-flow Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences; 10 ml bed volume). After washing with 7 column volumes of buffer H, bound proteins were eluted in buffer H supplemented with increasing salt concentrations (from 50 to 1500 mm Cl-) collecting 15-ml fractions. Fractions and flow-through were concentrated 100-fold using VivaSpin concentrators (Mr 10,000 cut-off) (VivaScience) and assayed. Samples eluting with 1000–1500 mm salt were pooled and loaded in a volume of 0.5 ml onto a HighPrep Sephacryl S-200 high resolution 16/60 gel-filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) in buffer H. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and concentrated 20-fold before analysis. TLC-based Deaminase Assay—Samples (2–4 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 5 h in 20 μl of buffer R (40 mm Tris, pH 8, 40 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol) containing 75,000 cpm of α-32P-dC-labeled single-stranded DNA (prepared by a 3 min heating to 95 °C of the products of asymmetric PCR amplification of the lacI region in pTrc99 performed using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol)). Following phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was digested with Penicillium citrinum P1 nuclease (Sigma) overnight at 37 °C (14Wagner R.W. Smith J.E. Cooperman B.S. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2647-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and the P1 digests then subjected to thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose in either (i) 0.5 m LiCl at 4 °C or (ii) at room temperature in 1 m CH3COOH until the buffer front had migrated 2.5 cm and then in 0.9 m CH3COOH:0.3 M LiCl (15Randerath K. Randerath E. Method Enzymol. 1967; 12: 323-347Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Products were detected using a phosphorimager. Chemical deamination of cytosine in DNA using bisulfite/hydroquinone was performed as described previously (16Grunau C. Clark S.J. Rosenthal A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E65Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). UDG-based Deaminase Assay—Samples (1–2 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in 10 μl of buffer R with 5′-biotinylated oligonucleotides that either were synthesized with fluorescein at their 3′-ends (3 pmol of oligonucleotide per reaction) or were 3′-labeled by ligation with [α-32P]dideoxyadenylate (100,000 cpm; 0.1 pmol) using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Reactions were terminated by heating to 90 °C for 3 min and oligonucleotides purified on streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynal), washing at 72 °C (except in Fig. 2A, where the streptavidin purification step was omitted). Deamination of cytosine in the oligonucleotides was monitored by incubating the bead-immobilized oligonucleotides at 37 °C for 30 min with excess uracil-DNA glycosylase (0.5 unit of UDG; enzyme and buffer from New England Biolabs) and then bringing the sample to 0.15 m in NaOH and incubating for a further 30 min. The oligonucleotides were then subjected to electrophoresis on 15% PAGE-urea gels which were developed by either fluorescence detection or phosphorimager analysis. Western Blotting—Western blot detection of APOBEC1 following SDS-PAGE of samples that had been diluted 20–100-fold was performed using a goat-anti-APOBEC1 serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), developing with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat immunoglobulin antiserum (Binding Site, Birmingham, UK). Low range molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. DNA Deamination Assay in Cell Extracts—Since, of all the APOBEC family members tested, APOBEC1 displayed the most potent mutator activity in the E. coli mutation assay (13Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), we focused on APOBEC1-transformed E. coli in order to see whether we could detect DNA deamination activity in vitro using cell extracts. Initially, we tried using the UDG-based deaminase assay, working with an oligodeoxyribonucleotide substrate. However, no evidence of deamination was obtained using double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates whereas single-stranded oligonucleotides were rapidly degraded by both APOBEC1 and control extracts (data not shown). We considered the possibility that the DNA deaminating activity might be specific for single-stranded substrates but that this activity might be masked by nonspecific nucleases. We therefore devised an assay that would be less sensitive to contaminating nucleases (Fig. 1A). The bacterial extracts were incubated with α-32P-dC-labeled single-stranded DNA which was then purified, digested with nuclease P1, and subjected to thin layer chromatography to test for the presence of [α-32P]dUMP. Clear evidence of dC deamination in this assay was detected using extracts of E. coli expressing two different APOBEC1 constructs but not from control extracts or from extracts made from E. coli cells carrying plasmids expressing mutant APOBEC1, APOBEC2, or dCTP deaminase (none of which function as DNA mutators in the bacterial assay (13Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1B). The DNA deaminase activity was also evident in APOBEC1 transformants of a mutant E. coli deficient in both dcd- and cdd-encoded deaminases (Fig. 1B, iii). That the product of APOBEC1 action was indeed dUMP is indicated by the co-migration of the radioactive product with dUMP in two distinct buffer systems. These results encouraged us to fractionate the extracts of APOBEC1-transformed E. coli to see whether the DNA deamination activity could be sufficiently separated from nonspecific nucleases so as to be detectable using the oligonucleotide cleavage assay. Partial Purification—Pilot experiments revealed that ion-exchange chromatography could be used to obtain samples of APOBEC1 that contained diminished nonspecific nuclease activity. Thus, while only a proportion of the APOBEC1 polypeptide bound to the Mono Q column (around 10–20% based on ECL quantitation of the Western blot assay), elution of this bound fraction with >0.8 m Cl- yielded a sample that displayed cytosine-DNA deamination activity (as monitored using the TLC-based assay) but containing diminished nonspecific nuclease activity in the UDG-based assay (Fig. 2A). These fractions were then concentrated and subjected to gel filtration (Fig. 2B). The major APOBEC1 peak eluted in fractions 7–9 (corresponding to an Mr of 95–140,000) co-eluting with peak DNA deaminating activity. Indeed, with these fractions from the gel filtration column, DNA deamination could now readily be detected by the UDG-based assay using a single-stranded oligonucleotide substrate (although the peak fractions also contained activity that removed the 3′-label from the oligonucleotide). Mass spectrometric analysis of proteins in fraction 9 following SDS-PAGE revealed the recombinant APOBEC1 migrating at the position marked by the asterisked in Fig. 2B, i, although the majority of the bands derived from ribosomal proteins. Characteristics of the DNA Deaminating Activity—The UDG-based deaminase assay was used to monitor the specificity and characteristics of the partially purified APOBEC1 (Fig. 3A). Samples were incubated with a single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotide (with or without its complement), which contained internal dC residue(s) and that was 5′-biotinylated as well as 3′-labeled. After purification on streptavidin, the oligonucleotide was treated with UDG (plus alkali), resulting in site-specific cleavage if the oligonucleotide had been subjected to dC → dU deamination. Thus, deamination is read out by the appearance of the specific cleavage product following PAGE-urea analysis. The partially purified wild type protein (but not the Glu63 → Ala mutant) showed clear activity on a single-stranded oligonucleotide with the cleavage being dependent on the subsequent incubation with UDG (Fig. 3, B and C). The deaminating activity was not inhibited by tetrahydrouridine (which inhibits cytidine deaminases (17Cohen R.M. Wolfenden R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7561-7565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) or by RNase (Fig. 3D). Strikingly (and consistent with our inability to detect deamination on double-stranded oligonucleotide substrates using crude extracts of bacterial transformants (see above)), the activity was blocked if a complementary (but not if an irrelevant) oligonucleotide was titrated into the assay (Fig. 3E). Examination of the cleavage products generated in the UDG-based assay suggests that not all dC residues are equally susceptible to APOBEC1-mediated deamination. While the data do not allow us yet to identify the ideal in vitro target for APOBEC1-mediated deamination, it is clear that in oligonucleotide SPM168 the third cytosine in the sequence TCCGCG is much less favored than the other two (Fig. 3, B–E). Similarly, evidence of specificity comes from comparing various related oligonucleotides as substrates, where all the data taken together point to deamination being especially disfavored when a purine is located immediately 5′ of the cytosine (Fig. 3, F and G). The results described here provide biochemical evidence that APOBEC1-mediated deamination of cytosine to uracil can occur on single-stranded DNA, is dependent on local sequence context, and is abolished by mutation of the APOBEC1 zinc coordination motif. Unlike AID (where genetic evidence indicates that the natural physiological substrate of deamination is DNA (11Di Noia J. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 419: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 12Rada C. Williams G.T. Nilsen H. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Neuberger M.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1748-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar)), the major physiological substrate of APOBEC1 is clearly apolipoprotein B RNA (4Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 5Blanc V. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the observation that misexpression of APOBEC1 in transgenic mice predisposes to cancer (18Yamanaka S. Balestra M.E. Ferrell L.D. Fan J. Arnold K.S. Taylor S. Taylor J.M. Innerarity T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8483-8487Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) suggests that APOBEC1-mediated DNA deamination could well be of pathological relevance. While these results now provide biochemical evidence of DNA deamination in vitro by an APOBEC family member, the DNA deaminating activity that we see here is weak. Thus, given the abundance of APOBEC1 polypeptide in the peak fraction from the gel filtration column, it appears that, on average, each molecule of recombinant APOBEC1 is responsible for in the order of a single deamination event in a 10-min incubation in the UDG-based assay. The weakness of this activity could of course reflect that the assay is suboptimal and might be enhanced by additional components or that the recombinant APOBEC1 is improperly folded, lacking some post-translational modification or unstable. However, crude calculations indicate that if the ∼500 molecules of APOBEC1 expressed in each E. coli transformant displayed a DNA deamination activity of this order in vivo and if this were targeted randomly to all cytosine residues in the genome, then this could, in principle, be more than sufficient to account for the several 1000-fold enhanced mutation frequencies seen at the rpoB and other loci in UDG-deficient E. coli following 20 generations of growth (13Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Similarly, somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin variable genes by targeted AID-mediated dC deamination may involve a single and most probably less than 10 targeted dC deamination events in each B lymphocyte cell cycle. The results reveal a clear sensitivity to the local sequence context of the APOBEC1-mediated dC deamination in the in vitro assay, most readily explained by a bias against a 5′-flanking purine residue. This would accord well with the in vivo data where a near-total restriction to mutation at dC residues with a 5′-flanking pyrimidine is seen at the rpoB locus (13Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) as well as a similar bias at another test locus in E. coli. 2R. C. L. Beale and M. S. Neuberger, unpublished data. Curiously, however, these findings contrast with the fact that the target cytosine of APOBEC1 in apolipoprotein B RNA is flanked by a 5′-A residue (2Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Pease R.J. Edwards Y.H. Knott T.J. Scott J. Cell. 1987; 50: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 3Chen S.H. Habib G. Yang C.Y. Gu Z.W. Lee B.R. Weng S.A.

It will obviously be interesting to obtain more information about both the structural and kinetic features of the interaction and activity of recombinant APOBEC1 on different RNA and DNA substrates. The in vitro assay also reveals that APOBEC1 deamination is targeted to single-stranded DNA and, indeed, was undetectable on double-stranded DNA. This specificity for single-stranded DNA is in accordance with the fact that the natural substrate of APOBEC1 is most likely single-stranded RNA (5Blanc V. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and presumably, the same active site in APOBEC1 is used for both types of polynucleotide. Furthermore, spontaneous deamination of cytosine is also much more rapid in single- (as opposed to double-) stranded DNA (19Frederico L.A. Kunkel T.A. Shaw B.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2532-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). If this in vitro preference of APOBEC1 for a single-stranded DNA substrate can be extrapolated to the in vivo situation as well as to other DNA-mutating APOBEC family members, it could go some way to explaining why AID-mediated DNA changes (somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination) correlate with transcription of the DNA target gene. Clearly, extending on the assays described here and applying them to other APOBEC family members should give valuable insight into the mechanism and specificity of APOBEC family-mediated DNA deamination.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 is at the center of a network of many proteins whose role is to guard the cell from potential cancer (1Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Curr. Opin.

Missense point mutations in p53 (see the mutation data base in www.iacr.fr/p53) lead to its inactivation and are involved in many human cancers (3Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Ball K.L. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 1-17Google Scholar, 4Lane D.P. Lain S. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S38-S42Google Scholar). These are mapped mainly to the DNA-binding core domain (5Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Google Scholar). Classification of the core domain mutants according to their DNA binding and thermodynamic stability properties results in the following three major phenotypes (6Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Google Scholar): 1) DNA contact mutants, which are unable to bind DNA but are as stable and almost as folded as the wild-type; 2) locally distorted and/or weakly destabilized mutants, partly unfolded, which are not fully able to bind DNA and are usually destabilized by less than ∼2 kcal/mol (6Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Google Scholar); and 3) globally destabilized mutants, which possess a high degree of unfolding and are destabilized by more than ∼3 kcal/mol. Accordingly, one of the important targets in cancer therapy is the rescue of p53 mutants (4Lane D.P. Lain S. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S38-S42Google Scholar, 7Bullock A.N. Fersht A.R. Nat. Rev.

Small molecules that bind the native but not the denatured state can restore the activity of unfolded p53 mutants by shifting the equilibrium toward the native state (7Bullock A.N. Fersht A.R. Nat.

We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of this approach and developed a peptide, FL-CDB3, which is able to stabilize mutant p53 core domain and rescue its sequence-specific DNA binding activity (8Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Google Scholar). Here, we have studied the kinetics of unfolding of p53 core domain mutants to gain a deeper understanding of the basis for their inactivation and the requirements for their rescue. We find that p53 core domain mutants are kinetically unstable, with an in vitro half-life of only a few minutes at 37 °C. We find a clear correlation between the thermodynamic and kinetic instability of p53 core domain mutants, the more unstable the mutant, the shorter the half-life. We also show that peptides can slow down the unfolding rate of the p53 core domain. We conclude that peptides like FL-CDB3, 1The abbreviations used are: FL-CDB3, fluorescein-labeled core domain binding 3; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; Mca, 7-methoxycoumarin; TCEP, Tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine. which rescue the conformation of destabilized p53 mutants, must act during or immediately after biosynthesis and maintain the mutant protein in its native state until it reaches the nucleus and binds its sequence-specific DNA. Protein Expression and Purification—Human p53 core domain wild-type and mutants (residues 94–312) and human tetrameric p53 (residues 94–360) were cloned, expressed, and purified as described (11Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Google Scholar). Details of full-length p53 purification will be published elsewhere. 2D. B. Veprintsev and A. R. Fersht, unpublished data. Peptide Studies—The peptide CDB38 (Lys (Mca)-REDEDEIE-NH2) was synthesized on a Pioneer peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using standard Fmoc chemistry as described (8Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Google Scholar, 12Hansson L.O. Friedler A. Freund S. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10305-10309Google Scholar). The peptide was labeled with 7-methoxycoumarin (Mca) using the amino acid derivative Fmoc-Lys (Mca)-OH (Novabiochem). Binding of CDB38 to the p53 core was determined using fluorescence anisotropy as described (8Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Google Scholar, 12Hansson L.O. Friedler A. Freund S. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10305-10309Google Scholar). Time-dependent Fluorescence Studies—Time-dependent fluorescence measurements were made at 30 or 37 °C using a PerkinElmer LS-50b luminescence spectrofluorometer controlled by a laboratory software or the original Winlab™ software. The buffer was 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm Tris-2-carboxyethylphosphine (TCEP). The protein was buffer exchanged on ice to a final concentration that varied between 1–20 μm and immediately transferred to 30 or 37 °C. The fluorescence emission spectra between 250–400 nm were recorded over time (usually 16–48 h). The unfolding rate constant k1 was calculated from fitting of the fluorescence at 300-nm (F300) data using Kaleidagraph™ software (Synergy software). In most cases, an exponential fit was used in accordance with Equation 1. When a subsequent linear phase was observed, caused by aggregation, a linear term was added to the function as seen in Equation 2. In Equations 1 and 2, shown below, F300=Aexp(−kobst)+C(Eq. 1) F300=Aexp(−kobst)+k2t+C(Eq. 2) A is the is the amplitude of the fluorescence curve, kobs is the observed unfolding rate constant (which is an estimate for k1; see below), k2 is the slope of the linear aggregation phase, and C is the lower limiting value for F300. The half-lives at the corresponding temperatures were calculated using t½ = ln 2/kobs. For full-length p53, the fluorescence at 350 nm was followed because of the different spectral properties. We measured the effects of urea on the rate of unfolding of the p53 core domain by mixing it with urea solutions on ice, transferring it immediately to 30 or 37 °C, and monitoring F300 continuously over 2–3 h. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm (bandwidth 7.5 nm), and the emission wavelength was 305 nm (bandwidth 7.5 nm). Data were fitted using Equations 1 and 2. Fluorescence spectra (280–400 nm) were taken after each experiment to estimate the state of unfolding of the protein. An Experimental System to Study the Transition between the Native, Denatured, and Aggregated Forms of p53 Core Domain—We were able to analyze the unfolding and aggregation processes by a combination of the spectral properties of p53 core domain and the effect of urea on its stability. The native state of p53 has a tyrosine-dominated fluorescence spectrum with λmax at 305 nm, whereas the denatured state has a tryptophan-dominated fluorescence spectrum with λmax at 350 nm. An aggregated state had λmax at 340 nm (Fig. 1 and Refs. 6Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Google Scholar and 11Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Google Scholar). We used light scattering, which increases greatly upon aggregation (see Ref. 13Parker T.G. Dalgleish D.G. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 2533-2547Google Scholar and references therein), and fluorescence to follow the transition between the native, denatured and aggregated forms of the p53 core domain. The protein was transferred from ice to 30 or 37 °C, and the fluorescence spectrum at 250–400 nm (upon excitation at 270 nm) was monitored over time. Three particular wavelengths, 270, 300, and 340 nm, were monitored (Figs. 1 and 2a). The signal at 270 nm (LS270) is primarily from light scattering. Because of its dependence on the amount and size of the particles in solution, its amplitude can give a measure of the ongoing aggregation process (13Parker T.G. Dalgleish D.G. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 2533-2547Google Scholar). The change in tyrosine fluorescence at 300 nm (F300) reflects the loss of the native state (11Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Google Scholar). The increase in tryptophan fluorescence at 340 nm (F340) results from a combination of the increments of the denatured and the aggregated states (11Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Google Scholar). F300 showed an exponential decrease, the half-life of which was concentration-independent. This behavior corresponds to a first-order reaction for protein unfolding. The exponential part of the curve was followed in certain cases by a linear decrease in F300, probably from aggregation of the unfolded fraction. In parallel, there was an exponential increase in F340 from the formation of the unfolded and the aggregated states. To estimate the observed unfolding rate (k1) for the p53 core domain variants, we fitted the F300 curves to an exponential function with a term for linear drift. The wild-type p53 core domain unfolded with k1 = 1.9 × 10–5 sec–1 (Table I). Replacing TCEP with dithiothreitol as a reducing agent resulted in k1 = 1.4 × 10–5 sec–1 (Table I), which is somewhat slower but still in the same range as the measured rate for TCEP. Similar experiments performed with tetrameric wild-type p53 (p53 core + tet, residues 94–360) resulted in k1 = 6 × 10–6 sec–1.Table IRate constants for the initial unfolding of wild-type and mutant p53 constructsp53 variantkobs(30 °C)kobs(37 °C)s-1s-1WT(1.90 ± 0.06) × 10-5(1.30 ± 0.01) × 10-3WT (DTT)aThe unfolding rate constant with 1 mM dithiothreitol in the buffer instead of TCEP.(1.40 ± 0.02) × 10-5NDV143A(1.80 ± 0.05) × 10-4NDI195T(5.7 ± 0.4) × 10-4>2.2 × 10-2C242S(1.8 ± 0.1) × 10-4NDG245S(2.40 ± 0.05) × 10-5(2.50 ± 0.02) × 10-3R248A(1.30 ± 0.02) × 10-4(6.3 ± 0.2) × 10-3R249S(5.1 ± 0.1) × 10-5NDR273A(2.30 ± 0.05) × 10-5(9.7 ± 0.3) × 10-3R273H(1.40 ± 0.07) × 10-5(1.80 ± 0.02) × 10-3WT-(94-360)(6.0 ± 0.1) × 10-6(3.10 ± 0.02) × 10-4WT-(1-393)bOwing to the different spectral properties of full-length p53, the fluorescence at 350 nm and not at 300 nm was followed.ND(3.3 ± 0.1) × 10-4a The unfolding rate constant with 1 mM dithiothreitol in the buffer instead of TCEP.b Owing to the different spectral properties of full-length p53, the fluorescence at 350 nm and not at 300 nm was followed. Open table in a new tab The minimal unfolding scheme of p53 at 30 and 37 °C was fitted to Reaction 1. Based on this reaction, shown below, p53native⇄k−1k1p53denatured→k2[small aggregate]→k3larger aggregatesReaction 1 the measured unfolding rate constant (kobs) for the wild-type p53 core domain equals k2k1/(k2 + k–1). We found that kobs ∼ k1 for the wild-type by studying the urea-dependence of unfolding. Urea induces the denaturation of many proteins according to equation 3 (14Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. 2d. Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999Google Scholar), log kobs=log kobsH2O+m [urea] (Eq. 4) where kobsH2O is the unfolding rate constant in water and m is a parameter that depends on the change in the accessible surface area. In the presence of higher concentrations of urea, k1 » k–1, because k–1 decreases with increasing concentrations of urea, whereas k1 increases for such reaction (14Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. 2d. Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999Google Scholar). A plot of ln kobsversus [urea] for the wild-type p53 core domain extrapolated to the value of kobs in the absence of urea, confirming that kobs in water was indeed k1 (Fig. 3) and showing that k1 is the rate determining step for the unfolding reaction. The intercept at 0 m urea was kobs = 2.6 ± 0.5 × 10–5 sec–1, in close agreement with the experimental value of kobs = 1.9 ± 0.06 × 10–5 sec–1 at 0 m urea (Table I). The slope, corresponding to the m value for unfolding (m) (14Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. 2d. Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999Google Scholar) was 2.5 m–1. For destabilized mutants, k2 » k–1, and thus kobs = k1. The aggregation process represented by k2 was suppressed by urea at higher concentrations, and only the first exponential phase was observed. Fluorescence spectra taken after the unfolding experiments were finished confirmed that, with an increasing urea concentration, as the fraction of unfolded p53 core domain increased, F340 became higher while F300 decreased significantly. Aggregation of Denatured p53 Core Domain—We tentatively analyzed the aggregation in the absence of urea. Typically, LS270 could be divided into four phases (Fig. 2b) as follows: 1) a lag phase, which occurred during the formation of an unfolded protein that presumably forms “seeds” for aggregation and lasted until a critical mass of unfolded protein was formed; 2) a fast linear increase upon the formation of larger aggregate particles that scattered light more; 3) a saturation level that was reached when the aggregates were fully formed, which led to 4) a drop in the intensity as the aggregates precipitated. The time course of LS270 was concentration dependent (Fig. 2b); aggregation got faster and the lag phase got shorter until it was impossible to detect with increasing protein concentration. We were unable to analyze the data quantitatively. Comparison of the light scattering and F300 data showed that the major unfolding event takes place during the observed lag phase. This means that the aggregation process is initiated only after a sufficient amount of unfolded protein is formed. Thus, p53 core domain unfolding occurs in a two-step mechanism, i.e. a rate-determining step of equilibrium unfolding followed by irreversible aggregation, as described in Reaction 1. Destabilized p53 Core Domain Mutants Denature Rapidly— We have studied the unfolding kinetics of p53 core domain mutants at 37 °C (Fig. 4). The mutants studied have mutations located in different sites within the protein and different thermodynamic stabilities (5Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Google Scholar, 6Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Google Scholar, 11Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Google Scholar). These were as follows: 1) the DNA contact “hot-spot” mutants R248A, R273H, and R273A, which have a stability similar to that of wild type; 2) the weakly destabilized G245S, which is located at the DNA binding loop 3, but the mutated residue does not interact directly with the DNA; 3) the highly destabilized β-sandwich mutants V143A and I195T; 4) the locally distorted loop 3 mutant R249S (15Nikolova P.V. Wong K.B. DeDecker B. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 370-378Google Scholar); and 5) the zinc-binding residue mutant C242S. The wild-type p53 core domain unfolded at 37 °C with kobs = 1.3 × 10–3 sec–1, corresponding to a half-life time (t½) of 9 min (Table I). The hot-spot mutants G245S and R273H, which are of similar stability to wild type, had t½ values of 4.6 and 6.4 min, respectively (Table I). The highly destabilized mutant I195T had kobs > 2.2 × 10–2 sec–1, corresponding to t½ of less than 1 min. In general, highly destabilized mutants unfold in less than 1–2 min at 37 °C and aggregate immediately after, so it was not possible to obtain quantitative data for them. We measured the unfolding rate constants of the destabilized mutants at 30 °C. kobs was 40–130 times lower than at 37 °C, with t½ = 8–14 h for wild type, G245S, and R273H, and 20–240 min for the highly destabilized mutants V143A, I195T, C242S, R248A, and R249S (Table I). There was a linear relationship between log t½ for unfolding and the free energy of denaturation (Fig. 5). The more destabilized mutants unfold faster both at 30 and 37 °C. In addition to faster unfolding, the more destabilized mutants also aggregated faster both at 30 and 37 °C. The R273 mutants, which have similar stability to that of the wild-type, aggregated only to a small extent and in a pattern similar to that of the wild-type. The loop 3 mutants in residues G245, R248, and R249, which are destabilized by 1–2 kcal/mol, aggregate faster. The highly destabilized mutants, such as C242S, V143A, and I195T, aggregated fully in less than 10 min. Tetramerization Increased the Kinetic Stability of Wild-type p53—We repeated the unfolding experiments for the tetrameric p53 construct (residues 94–360), which contains the core and tetramerization domains, and for the full-length protein (residues 1–393). At 37 °C, wild-type p53-(1–393) and p53-(94–360) were four times kinetically more stable than core domain only (residues 94–312), with t½ = 35–37 min (compared with 9 min for p53 core domain). Similar results were obtained at 30 °C, where tetrameric wild-type p53-(94–360) was 3–4 times more stable than core only. A p53-stabilizing Peptide Slowed Down the p53 Unfolding Rate—The peptide CDB3 (REDEDEIEW-NH2) and its derivatives, which bind the native but not the denatured state of p53 core domain, can restore the activity of unfolded p53 mutants by shifting the equilibrium toward the native state (8Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Google Scholar). The most potent CDB3 derivative is the fluorescein-labeled peptide, FL-CDB3. However, we could not test the effect of FL-CDB3 on p53 core unfolding, because the presence of fluorescein and tryptophan causes its fluorescence spectrum to mask that of p53 core. We synthesized a new CDB3 derivative in which we omitted the tryptophan and labeled it with Mca instead of fluorescein. The peptide, CDB38, had the sequence Lys (Mca)-REDEDEIE-NH2. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments have shown that CDB38 bound the p53 core with Kd = 15 μm at 10 °C. CDB38 slowed down the unfolding of p53 core domain at 37 °C in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6). In the presence of 105 μm CDB38, the unfolding rate of p53 core was kobs = 3.5 × 10–4, corresponding to a half-life of 33 min, which is 3.7 times longer than in the absence of the peptide. Increasing the concentration of CDB38 to 250 μm resulted in a half-life of 50 min, which is 5.7 longer than that of the p53 core alone. In theory, the data should fit Equation 4, shown below, kobs=k0Kd 37deg/([CDB38]+Kd 37deg)(Eq. 5) where k0 is the unfolding rate constant in the absence of peptide and Kd37 deg is Kd for CDB38-p53 binding at 37 °C. Fitting the data to this equation resulted in Kd37 deg = 43 ± 7 μm (Fig. 6). Kinetics of Unfolding of p53 Core Domain—The wild-type p53 core domain unfolded with a half-life of 9 min at 37 °C and ∼10 h at 30 °C. This step was followed by a concentration-dependent rapid aggregation phase. There was a lag phase in the aggregation process during the initial unfolding process that lasted, presumably, until a critical mass of unfolded p53 was formed to produce seeds for aggregation, which grew rapidly to high molecular weight aggregates. A similar aggregation pattern was recently reported for zinc-free p53 (16Butler J.S. Loh S.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2396-2403Google Scholar). Thermodynamically Destabilized p53 Core Domain Mutants Are Also Kinetically Unstable—p53 mutants that are thermodynamically unstable (6Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Google Scholar, 11Bullock A.N. Henckel J. DeDecker B.S. Johnson C.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Lane D.P. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14338-14342Google Scholar) unfolded more rapidly at body temperature (Figs. 4 and 5). At 37 °C, the estimated degree of unfolding of the mutants used in this study (6Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Google Scholar) ranges from nearly completely native proteins (R273H, 2% unfolded and G245S, 5% unfolded), through mutants like R249S (15% unfolded) and C242S (53% unfolded), to highly unfolded mutants (I195T, 86% unfolded and V143A, 70% unfolded). Mutants that are less stable than wild-type by >2 kcal/mol, such as V143A, I195T, C242S, and R249S (6Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Google Scholar), unfolded more than 10 times faster (Fig. 5). Mutants such as I195T, which are highly destabilized, had very short half-lives, which were sometimes too short to measure at 37 °C. Less destabilized mutants, such as R273H and G245S, unfolded only slightly faster than wild-type. The fact that mutants with a higher unfolding degree aggregate faster implies that aggregation occurs from a denatured state. For wild type p53, this denatured state could be monitored using urea, as shown here, or by looking at the zinc-free form (16Butler J.S. Loh S.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2396-2403Google Scholar). Implications for Rescue by Small Molecules—The kinetic stability and thermodynamic stability of p53 decrease in parallel. Many destabilized mutants have melting temperatures that are below body temperature and, therefore, denature very rapidly after biosynthesis and before they even become functional because of their short half-lives at body temperature. The kinetic instability may be the underlying reason for their inactivation. Our results for the peptide CDB38 demonstrate that the peptides that bind the native but not the denatured state of p53 core domain (7Bullock A.N. Fersht A.R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 68-76Google Scholar, 8Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Google Scholar) can increase the half-life of the p53 core domain and thus stabilize it. Such drugs, which rescue the conformation of unstable mutants of p53 (e.g. FL-CDB3 (8Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Google Scholar) or possibly PRIMA-1 (9Bykov V.J. Issaeva N. Shilov A. Hultcrantz M. Pugacheva E. Chumakov P. Bergman J. Wiman K.G. Selivanova G. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 282-288Google Scholar)) must have to act during biosynthesis, before the rapid unfolding of the mutant protein takes place (see model in Fig. 7). These drugs will maintain the newly synthesized protein in its native conformation, prevent its unfolding and aggregation, and allow its localization to the nucleus, where it will be able to bind its target DNA. Once the mutant p53 reaches its target location or is bound to other proteins, it can be stabilized by the specific DNA or the p53 binding proteins that will displace the drug, which will be free to bind another newly synthesized mutant p53. This is the basis of a chaperoning strategy to rescue mutant p53 (8Friedler A. Hansson L.O. Veprintsev D.B. Freund S.M. Rippin T.M. Nikolova P.V. Proctor M.R. Rudiger S. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 937-942Google Scholar). It is important for the chaperoning strategy that the drug will not prevent the nuclear import of p53. The binding of FL-CDB3 is balanced so that it binds tightly enough to stabilize p53 but not so tightly that it cannot be displaced. Indeed, preliminary results with living cancer cells show that FL-CDB3 is effective in vivo. 3N. Issaeva, G. Selivanova, K. Wiman, A. Friedler, and A. R. Fersht, unpublished data.

These inclusions contain α-synuclein as the major component of the filamentous aggregates. Hence these diseases are classified as synucleinopathies (6Galvin J.E. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Arch. Neurol. 2001; 58: 186-190Google Scholar). The importance of α-synuclein in neurodegeneration has been established by the findings that missense mutations in the α-synuclein gene cause familial PD (7Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E.

Haass C. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1429-1439Google Scholar). LBs also contain ubiquitin (13Kuzuhara S. Mori H. Izumiyama N. Yoshimura M. Ihara Y. Acta Neuropathol. 1998; 75: 345-353Google Scholar) and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase-L1 (14Lowe J. McDermott H. Landon M. Mayer R.J. Wilkinson K.D. J. Pathol. 1990; 161: 153-160Google Scholar), which may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Genetic studies on autosomal-recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP) led to the identification of the responsible gene, parkin, which encodes ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) (15Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Google Scholar). Loss-of-function mutations in parkin result in the accumulation of its substrates such as synphilin-1 (16Chung K.K. Zhang Y. Lim K.L. Tanaka Y. Huang H. Gao J. Ross C.A. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1144-1150Google Scholar), O-glycosylated α-synuclein (17Shimura H. Schlossmacher M.G. Hattori N. Frosch M.P. Trockenbacher A. Schneider R. Mizuno Y. Kosik K.S. Selkoe D.J. Science. 2001; 293: 263-269Google Scholar), and Pael receptor (18Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Google Scholar) and cause neuronal damage without formation of visible inclusions. Synphilin-1 was first identified as an α-synuclein-binding protein (19Engelender S. Kaminsky Z. Guo X. Sharp A.H. Amaravi R.K. Kleiderlein J.J. Margolis R.L. Troncoso J.C. Lanahan A.A. Worley P.F. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Ross C.A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 110-114Google Scholar) and was found to accumulate in LBs (20Wakabayashi K. Engelender S. Yoshimoto M. Tsuji S. Ross C.A. Takahashi H. Ann. Neurol. 2000; 47: 521-523Google Scholar). Thus, impairment in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and accumulation of α-synuclein and other proteins in the neuronal cytoplasm may represent common molecular mechanisms underlying PD and AR-JP. Septins are a family of filament-forming guanine nucleotide-binding proteins involved in cytokinesis, exocytosis, and other cellular processes (21Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Google Scholar, 22Beites C.L. Xie H. Bowser R. Trimble W.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 434-439Google Scholar, 23Field C.M.

At least 10 septin genes, Sept1–Sept10, have been identified in mouse as well as human genomes (25Macara I.G. Baldarelli R. Field C.M. Glotzer M. Hayashi Y. Hsu S.H. Kennedy M.B. Kinoshita M. Longtine M. Low C. Maltais L.J. McKenzie L. Mitchison T.J. Nishikawa T. Noda M. Petty E.M. Peifer M. Pringle J.R. Robinson P.J. Roth D. Russell S.E. Stuhlmann H. Tanaka M. Tanaka T. Trimble W.S. Ware J. Zeleznik-Le N.J. Zieger B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4111-4113Google Scholar). Although septin family members can form co-polymers, their differential expression patterns in mammalian brains indicate some functional diversity among septins (26Kinoshita A. Noda M. Kinoshita M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 428: 223-239Google Scholar). Three septins (Sept1, Sept2, and Sept4) are accumulated in tau-based filamentous deposits known as neurofibrillary tangles and glial fibrils in Alzheimer's disease (27Kinoshita A. Kinoshita M. Akiyama H. Tomimoto H. Akiguchi I. Kumar S. Noda M. Kimura J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1551-1560Google Scholar). A splice variant of the Sept4 gene encodes a mitochondrial protein called ARTS (apoptosis-related protein in the transforming growth factor-β signaling pathway), which mediates a pro-apoptotic signal (28Larisch S. Yi Y. Lotan R. Kerner H. Eimerl S. Tony Parks W. Gottfried Y. Birkey Reffey S. de Caestecker M.P. Danielpour D. Book-Melamed N. Timberg R. Duckett C.S. Lechleider R.J. Steller H. Orly J. Kim S.J. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 915-921Google Scholar). These data support the hypothesis that accumulation of a class of septins may accelerate neurodegeneration. In addition, Sept5 was found to be a substrate of Parkin (29Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Google Scholar). Sept5 is associated with γ-aminobutyric acidergic synaptic vesicles (26Kinoshita A. Noda M. Kinoshita M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 428: 223-239Google Scholar), and excessive expression of Sept5 was found to interfere with regulated exocytosis (22Beites C.L. Xie H. Bowser R. Trimble W.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 434-439Google Scholar). Thus, accumulation of Sept5 may affect dopamine release in the nigrostriatal system in AR-JP (29Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13354-13359Google Scholar, 30Chung K.K. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: S7-S14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In this study, we have conducted an immunohistochemical examination of brain tissues from patients afflicted by Parkinson's disease or two other synucleinopathies. We found that Sept4 was co-localized with α-synuclein in LBs/GCIs in all cases. We also analyzed the physical and functional interaction among Sept4, α-synuclein, and synphilin-1 in cultured cells. Our data suggest that these proteins are involved in the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions as well as induction of cell death. Tissues—Postmortem brain samples were obtained from five patients with PD (age: range, 66–79 years; mean, 74.6 years), two with DLB (69 and 69.0 years), five with MSA (71–78 and 75.0 years), and four with non-neurological diseases (68–81 and 74.5 years) from the Department of Neurology, Kyoto University Hospital. The brain specimens were used for neuropathological investigation after informed consent was obtained from the patients' relatives. The diagnoses of PD, DLB (pure form), and MSA were established on the basis of clinical and neuropathological data according to widely accepted criteria (31Gelb D.J. Oliver E. Gilman S. Arch.

After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, tissues were dissected. The midbrain and cerebellum were embedded in paraffin and sliced (6 μmin thickness). The frontal lobe, pons, caudatoputamen, and thalamus were freeze-sectioned (20 μm). Mouse brains were obtained from adult male C57Bl/6 mice (25–30 g) after deep anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and transcardial perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), using procedures approved by the Animal Use and Care Committee of Kyoto University. Anti-septin Antibodies, Immunoblot Assay, and Immunohistochemistry—The following polyclonal antibodies were generated as described elsewhere (host animal and antigen are given in parentheses) (21Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Google Scholar, 26Kinoshita A. Noda M. Kinoshita M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 428: 223-239Google Scholar, 27Kinoshita A. Kinoshita M. Akiyama H. Tomimoto H. Akiguchi I. Kumar S. Noda M. Kimura J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1551-1560Google Scholar): H5C-2 (rabbit; oligopeptide corresponding to residues 466–478 of mouse Sept4), CRC-3 (guinea pig; residues 358–369 of human Sept5), C10C-3 (guinea pig; residues 400–418 of human Sept7), N5N-1 (rabbit; residues 1–18 of mouse/human Sept2), S6C-3 (guinea pig; residues 413–427 of mouse/human Sept6), and S7C-1 (rabbit; residues 415–429 of human Sept8). The authenticity and specificity of these antibodies were confirmed by antigen adsorption experiments and in some cases by immunoblot assay using cells overexpressing the corresponding gene. Human and mouse brain homogenates (50 μg) were analyzed by standard immunoblot assays (26Kinoshita A. Noda M. Kinoshita M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 428: 223-239Google Scholar, 27Kinoshita A. Kinoshita M. Akiyama H. Tomimoto H. Akiguchi I. Kumar S. Noda M. Kimura J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1551-1560Google Scholar) using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-septin antibodies (see above) or goat anti-α-synuclein antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as the primary antibodies. Brain sections were stained by immunoperoxidase techniques using Vectastain ABC kits (Vector) with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as a chromogen or by immunofluorescent staining procedures with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Plasmids—The coding region of human α-synuclein cDNA was cloned in-frame between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech) to express α-synuclein tagged with the Myc epitope at its amino terminus (Myc-α-syn). The coding region of mouse Sept4 cDNA was cloned between the EagI and SalI sites of the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Sigma) to express Sept4 tagged with FLAG epitope at its amino terminus (FLAG-Sept4). The coding region of Sept2 was cloned between the HindIII and XbaI sites of the same vector to express FLAG-Sept2. The coding region of human synphilin-1 was cloned into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen) to express synphilin-1 tagged with V5 epitope at its carboxyl terminus (V5-synphilin-1 (34Mclean P.J. Kawamata H. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 901-912Google Scholar)) (a generous gift from Dr. P. J. McLean). The missense mutations, A30P in α-synuclein and G154V in Sept4, were introduced into the respective wild type cDNAs using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The integrity of each insert cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Lines, Transfection, and Fractionation of Cellular Components— Two mouse cell lines, NIH3T3 and N18, were transiently transfected with expression vectors using LipofectAMINE-2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 or 48 h, the cells were rinsed with cold PBS and then lysed using Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). Fractionation of the subcellular components and subsequent immunoprecipitation were carried out as described previously (18Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, the cell lysates were fractionated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and each fraction was adjusted to the same volume with SDS sample buffer, sonicated (see below), and heat denatured. Equal volumes of these samples were subjected to immunoblot assay, and the amounts of immunoreactive proteins were estimated by densitometry using NIH Image software (version 1.62). Co-immunoprecipitation—N18 cells (∼2 × 105) transfected with 2 μg of each plasmid were incubated for 24 h and fractionated as described above. The supernatant fraction was directly immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibodies (Sigma) and protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins in the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction were solubilized in 1% SDS with the aid of sonication for 20 s and diluted with 10 volumes of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, supernatants from the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fractions were immunoprecipitated. The beads bearing immune complexes were washed three times with 25 volumes of lysis buffer followed by four washings with PBS. The proteins on the beads were solubilized and analyzed by immunoblot assay. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, a human brain sample was homogenized in 4 volumes of PBS containing 320 mm sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 37,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, the supernatant fraction was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-hemagglutinin (HA), anti-α-synuclein (Affiniti Research Products, Exeter, United Kingdom), or anti-Sept4 antibodies. Following five washings with PBS, the precipitates were subjected to immunoblot assay using anti-α-synuclein antibodies. Immunofluorescent Staining of Cultured Cells and Scoring of Dead Cells—NIH3T3 or N18 cells transfected with three plasmids (each expressing Myc-α-syn, FLAG-Sept4, or V5-synphilin-1) in various combinations were incubated in the absence or presence of 10–20 μm lactacystin for 24 h and immunostained as described previously (21Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies against Myc (Sigma), V5 (Invitrogen), or FLAG or rabbit polyclonal antibodies against α-synuclein, FLAG (Sigma), or ubiquitin (Sigma) were used as primary antibodies. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibodies. Dead cells were scored after brief staining with 0.2% trypan blue (Invitrogen) or with 1.0 μg/ml annexin V-enhanced green fluorescent protein (Clontech) plus 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Clontech). Ubiquitination Assay—NIH3T3 cells (∼5 × 104) transfected with 1 μg of FLAG-Sept4 expression vector were incubated in growth medium for 24 h and then in medium with or without 20 μm lactacystin for an additional 16 h. Fractionated cell lysates were analyzed directly, or after immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies, by immunoblot assay using antibodies against ubiquitin or FLAG. Statistics—Quantitative data were collected in at least three independent experiments. Significance of difference between data groups was assessed by Student's t test using StatView II software (version 5.0 for Macintosh, SAS Institute). p values smaller than 0.05 were considered significant. Expression of Six Septins in Human and Mouse Brains—We first examined the expression of six septins in the normal human frontal lobe and mouse whole brain by immunoblot assay using specific antibodies (Fig. 1). All six septins were detected in the human and mouse brains. The anti-Sept4 antibody (H5C-2) detected three major bands of 53, 51, and 49 kDa in the human brain; this antibody does not recognize the 32-kDa pro-apoptotic Sept4 variant, ARTS (28Larisch S. Yi Y. Lotan R. Kerner H. Eimerl S. Tony Parks W. Gottfried Y. Birkey Reffey S. de Caestecker M.P. Danielpour D. Book-Melamed N. Timberg R. Duckett C.S. Lechleider R.J. Steller H. Orly J. Kim S.J. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 915-921Google Scholar), because ARTS lacks the carboxyl-terminal region of Sept4 where the epitope for H5C-2 resides. Sept4 Is Commonly Associated with α-Synuclein-based Cytoplasmic Inclusions—Having established the expression of six septins in the normal mouse brain and human frontal lobe, we next studied the expression of these septins in the postmortem brain samples from patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, in all of the PD cases we tested (n = 5), nigral LBs were found to be stained positive with the anti-Sept4 antibody (H5C-2) (Fig. 2, A and B). Preadsorption of H5C-2 with its cognate antigen abolished this staining (data not shown). Double staining of serial sections indicated that 70–80% of α-synuclein-positive LBs were Sept4-positive (data not shown). Distribution of these two proteins, however, looked different; Sept4-staining was low in the corona of LB where α-synuclein staining was most intense (Fig. 2, C and D). Sept4 was also found in another type of α-synuclein-positive structures termed pale bodies (Fig. 2, C and D, arrowheads) (3Irizarry M.C. Growdon W. Gomez-Isla T. Newell K. George J.M. Clayton D.F. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 57: 334-337Google Scholar). Such aberrant structures containing Sept4 were not found in nigral neurons in normal control brains (n = 4; data not shown). All six septins examined are expressed in normal substantia nigra (26Kinoshita A. Noda M. Kinoshita M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 428: 223-239Google Scholar), and yet none of them except Sept4 was found to be accumulated in LBs, suggesting selective incorporation of Sept4 into LBs (data not shown). Sept4 was also detected in the cortical and nigral LBs in brains with DLB (n = 2, Fig. 2, E–G). The Sept4-positive cortical LBs frequently found in the small-to-medium-size, non-pyramidal neurons in deeper cortical layers lacked distinct core (Fig. 2, E and F), whereas the nigral LBs (Fig. 2G) were similar in morphology to those in PD (see above). Immunofluorescent double staining revealed that most of the α-synuclein-positive inclusions found in DLB brains were Sept4-positive. In cortical LBs, distribution of Sept4 and α-synuclein appeared to be tightly overlapped (Fig. 2, H–J). Again, none of the septins examined except Sept4 was found to accumulate in the nigral and cortical LBs in DLB brains. Our previous studies indicate that Sept4 is expressed in both neurons and glial cells (26Kinoshita A. Noda M. Kinoshita M. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 428: 223-239Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, we found Sept4-positive GCIs in several regions including the cerebellum, pons, caudatoputamen, and thalamus in brains with MSA (n = 5, Fig. 3). These findings demonstrate common and selective association of Sept4 with the inclusions in synucleinopathies. Physical Interaction between Sept4 and α-Synuclein in the Brain and in Cultured Cells—To test the possible interaction between Sept4 and α-synuclein in vivo, human brain homogenate was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA (negative control), anti-α-synuclein, or anti-Sept4 antibodies and then subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-α-synuclein antibodies (Fig. 4A). A fraction of α-synuclein was consistently pulled down with Sept4, indicating direct or indirect physical interaction between Sept4 and α-synuclein in vivo. To analyze the molecular nature of this interaction, mouse cell lines (N18 neuroblastoma and NIH3T3 fibroblast) were co-transfected with a plasmid vector expressing α-synuclein tagged with Myc epitope (Myc-α-syn) and a second vector expressing either the normal Sept4, a mutant Sept4 (Sept4G154V), or the normal Sept2, each tagged with the FLAG epitope (Fig. 4, B and C). We chose to use short epitope tags (Myc and FLAG) to reduce the probability of generating insoluble fusion proteins, as has been reported for the green fluorescent protein tag (34Mclean P.J. Kawamata H. Hyman B.T. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 901-912Google Scholar). Sept4G154V has a missense mutation in its “P-loop” domain and shows reduced guanine nucleotide-binding activity (21Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Google Scholar, 28Larisch S. Yi Y. Lotan R. Kerner H. Eimerl S. Tony Parks W. Gottfried Y. Birkey Reffey S. de Caestecker M.P. Danielpour D. Book-Melamed N. Timberg R. Duckett C.S. Lechleider R.J. Steller H. Orly J. Kim S.J. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 915-921Google Scholar, 35Zhang J. Kong C. Xie H. McPherson P.S. Grinstein S. Trimble W.S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1458-1467Google Scholar). The transfected cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and the subcellular components were separated into Nonidet P-40-soluble and -insoluble fractions. We subjected each fraction directly or after immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibodies to the immunoblot assay using anti-Myc antibodies (to detect Myc-α-syn) or anti-FLAG antibodies (to detect FLAG-septins). From the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction, Myc-α-syn co-precipitated with FLAG-Sept4 (Fig. 4B, middle panel, lane 4), indicating physical interaction between tagged α-synuclein and Sept4 in cultured cells. Myc-α-syn co-precipitated with FLAG-Sept4G154V or FLAG-Sept2 was less than that co-precipitated with FLAG-Sept4 (Fig. 4B, middle panel; compare lanes 4, 6, and 8) even though the total amount of Myc-α-syn in the sample of FLAG-Sept4G154V- or FLAG-Sept2-transfected cells was comparable with, if not greater than, that in the sample of FLAG-Sept4-transfected cells (Fig. 4B, top panel; compare lanes 6 and 8 with lane 4). This may reflect the difference in the levels of FLAG-tagged septins present in these samples and/or the difference in their ability to be incorporated into the molecular complexes. Nevertheless, the wild type FLAG-Sept4 construct was the most efficient among the three septin constructs we tested in bringing down Myc-α-syn from the Nonidet P-40-soluble fraction. The amount of Myc-α-syn found in the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction was small when expressed alone (Fig. 4C, top panel, lane 2) but was increased when FLAG-Sept4 or FLAG-Sept4G154V was co-expressed (Fig. 4C, top panel, lanes 4 and 6); this effect was minimal when FLAG-Sept2 was co-expressed (Fig. 4C, top panel, lane 8). Interestingly, immunoprecipitable FLAG-tagged protein and the associated Myc-α-syn came to the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction only when FLAG-Sept4 and Myc-α-syn were co-expressed (Fig. 4C, bottom two panels, lane 4), suggesting that FLAG-Sept4 and Myc-α-syn become insoluble to Nonidet P-40 in a co-operative manner. In contrast, FLAG-Sept4G154V and FLAG-Sept2 failed to bring Myc-α-syn to the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction (Fig. 4C, bottom two panels, lanes 6 and 8). We obtained similar results with NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). FLAG-Sept4 and Myc-α-syn Become Detergent-insoluble when Co-expressed—The above observations suggest that FLAG-Sept4 and Myc-α-syn are soluble when expressed alone but both become insoluble when they are co-expressed. To confirm this model, NIH3T3 cells transfected with plasmids in various combinations were lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and partition of each protein into the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions was estimated by immunoblot assay (Fig. 5). Consistent with the above observation (Fig. 4C), co-expression of Myc-α-syn brought more FLAG-Sept4 into the pellet fraction (Fig. 5, compare panels 1 and 2). In contrast, Myc-α-syn showed little effects on the solubility of FLAG-Sept4G154V or FLAG-Sept2 under these conditions (Fig. 5, compare panels 4 and 5, and panels 7 and 8). Reciprocally, co-expression of FLAG-Sept4, but not FLAG-Sept4G154V or FLAG-Sept2, brought more Myc-α-syn into the insoluble fraction (Fig. 5, compare panels 3, 6, and 9). These data demonstrate the bidirectional nature of the interaction between FLAG-Sept4 and Myc-α-syn in bringing these proteins into the Nonidet P-40-insoluble fraction. Localization and Biological Activity of Overexpressed FLAG-Sept4 and Myc-α-syn in Cultured Cells—To determine the subcellular localization of FLAG-Sept4 and Myc-α-syn, we performed immunofluorescent staining of transfected cells using anti-FLAG and anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 6A). FLAG-Sept4 and Myc-α-syn were diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm with apparent accumulation and co-localization at the cortex or periphery of the cells (Fig. 6A, top row). After treatment with a proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, a subset (∼30%) of the cells contained punctate aggregates at the cell periphery and/or rods in the cytoplasmic protrusions (Fig. 6A, middle row). Interestingly, a fraction (∼5%) of doubly transfected, lactacystin-treated cells contained large, double-positive structures reminiscent of LBs (Fig. 6A, bottom row). Such a structure was not found in cells expressing FLAG-Sept4 alone or Myc-α-syn alone. Aggregates were rare in the cells expressing Myc-α-syn alone (Fig. 6B), FLAG-Sept4 alone (<0.5%, data not shown), or Myc-α-syn plus FLAG-Sept4G154V or FLAG-Sept2 (<5%, data not shown). Interestingly, a dye exclusion assay using trypan blue showed that the cells expressing both FLAG-Sept4 and Myc-α-syn were more sensitive to cytotoxicity by lactacystin as compared with the cells expressing one of the proteins alone or transfected with empty vectors (Fig. 6C). Separate experiments employing annexin V-enhanced green fluorescent protein and propidium iodide to stain dying cells also showed similar results (data not shown). Hence, FLAG-Sept4 and Myc-α-syn were co-operative in making cells vulnerable to the stress induced by proteasome inhibition. The FLAG(Sept4)/Myc(α-syn) double"

Lp(a) may interfere with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated plasminogen activation in fibrinolysis, thereby generating a hypercoagulable state in vivo. A fluorescence-based system was employed to study the effect of apo(a) on plasminogen activation in the presence of native fibrin and degraded fibrin cofactors and in the absence of positive feedback reactions catalyzed by plasmin. Human Lp(a) and a physiologically relevant, 17-kringle recombinant apo(a) species exhibited strong inhibition with both cofactors. A variant lacking the protease domain also exhibited strong inhibition, indicating that the apo(a)-plasminogen binding interaction mediated by the apo(a) protease domain does not ultimately inhibit plasminogen activation. A variant in which the strong lysine-binding site in kringle IV type 10 had been abolished exhibited substantially reduced inhibition whereas another lacking the kringle V domain showed no inhibition. Amino-terminal truncation mutants of apo(a) also revealed that additional sequences within kringle IV types 1–4 are required for maximal inhibition. To investigate the inhibition mechanism, the concentrations of plasminogen, cofactor, and a 12-kringle recombinant apo(a) species were systematically varied. Kinetics for both cofactors conformed to a single, equilibrium template model in which apo(a) can interact with all three fibrinolytic components and predicts the formation of ternary (cofactor, tPA, and plasminogen) and quaternary (cofactor, tPA, plasminogen, and apo(a)) catalytic complexes. The latter complex exhibits a reduced turnover number, thereby accounting for inhibition of plasminogen activation in the presence of apo(a)/Lp(a).

Koschinsky M.L. Semin. Vasc. Med. 2002; 2: 335-344Google Scholar). Originally described by Berg (2Berg K. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Scand. 1963; 59: 362-382Google Scholar), Lp(a) is similar to low density lipoprotein in that it contains a cholesteryl ester core surrounded by a monolayer of unesterified cholesterol and phospholipid in which apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) is embedded. Lp(a) is distinct from low density lipoprotein in that it contains a single molecule of an additional glycoprotein moiety called apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), which is covalently linked to apoB-100 by a single disulfide bond (3Koschinsky M.L. Côté G. Gabel B. van der Hoek Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19819-19825Google Scholar, 4Brunner C. Kraft H-G. Utermann G. Müller H-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Google Scholar). The cloning of apo(a) revealed a striking similarity between apo(a) and the fibrinolytic serine protease zymogen plasminogen (5McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W-H. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Google Scholar). The apo(a) moiety of Lp(a) lacks sequences corresponding to the plasminogen kringle (K) 1, 2, and 3 domains, yet contains multiple repeats of the plasminogen K4-like domain (apo(a) KIV) followed by plasminogen K5-like and protease-like sequences (apo(a) KV and protease-like (P) domains, respectively) (5McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W-H. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Google Scholar). There are 10 distinct classes of apo(a) KIV repeats (designated KIV1-KIV10) that differ from one another by only a small number of amino acid substitutions (5McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W-H. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Google Scholar). There is a single copy of each KIV repeat except for KIV2, which is known as the major repeat kringle (6Lackner C. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 933-940Google Scholar, 7van der Hoek Y.Y. Wittekoek M.E. Beisiegel U. Kastelein J.J.P. Koschinsky M.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 361-366Google Scholar). This sequence can be present in 3 to greater than 30 identical copies that gives rise to Lp(a) isoform size heterogeneity in the population (8Marcovina S.M. Hobbs H.H. Albers J.J. Clin. Chem. 1996; 42: 436-439Google Scholar). Apo(a) KIV5–8 each contain a weak lysine binding site, which mediate the initial non-covalent interaction between apo(a) and apoB-100 in Lp(a) assembly (9Ernst A. Helmhold M. Brunner C. Petho-Schramm P. Armstrong V.W. Müller H-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 6227-6234Google Scholar, 10Gabel B.R. May L.F. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Apo(a) KIV9 contains an unpaired cysteine residue that forms the disulfide linkage with apoB-100 in Lp(a) assembly (3Koschinsky M.L. Côté G. Gabel B. van der Hoek Y.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19819-19825Google Scholar, 4Brunner C. Kraft H-G. Utermann G. Müller H-J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11643-11647Google Scholar). Apo(a) KIV10 contains a stronger lysine binding site that is believed to mediate binding of apo(a)/Lp(a) to lysine residues exposed on the surface of biological substrates such as fibrin (12Sangrar W. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 723-731Google Scholar, 13Harpel P.C. Gordon B.R. Parker T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3847-3851Google Scholar). The apo(a) protease-like domain exhibits no catalytic activity (14Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15777-15784Google Scholar). The similarity of Lp(a) to both low density lipoprotein and plasminogen suggests that the pathogenic mechanism of Lp(a) likely involves both proatherogenic and prothrombotic/antifibrinolytic effects (1Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Semin. Vasc. Med. 2002; 2: 335-344Google Scholar). Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that apo(a)/Lp(a) can inhibit fibrinolysis (15Biemond B.J. Friederich P.W.

Moreover, binding interactions have been demonstrated between apo(a)/Lp(a) and fibrin(ogen), plasmin-modified fibrin(ogen), plasminogen, and tPA (13Harpel P.C. Gordon B.R. Parker T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3847-3851Google Scholar, 18Loscalzo J. Weinfeld M. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 240-245Google Scholar, 19Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6671-6677Google Scholar). Early studies demonstrated that apo(a)/Lp(a) can inhibit the binding of plasminogen and tPA to fibrin (13Harpel P.C. Gordon B.R. Parker T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3847-3851Google Scholar, 18Loscalzo J. Weinfeld M. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 240-245Google Scholar), but the mechanism by which apo(a) inhibits plasminogen activation remains controversial as both competitive (23Edelberg J.M. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. Thromb. Res. 1990; 57: 155-162Google Scholar) and uncompetitive (18Loscalzo J. Weinfeld M. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 240-245Google Scholar, 24Leerink C.B. Gimpel J.A. Kortlandt W. Bouma B.N. van Rijn H.J.M. Fibrinolysis. 1991; 5: 233-238Google Scholar) mechanisms have been reported. Efficient activation of plasminogen requires the formation of a ternary complex between substrate (plasminogen), enzyme (tPA), and cofactor (fibrin) (25Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2912-2919Google Scholar, 26Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2183-2191Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of plasminogen activation are complicated by the existence of plasmin-mediated positive feedback reactions. First, limited plasmin cleavage of fibrin results in the exposure of carboxyl-terminal lysine residues in the cofactor that enhance plasminogen binding (27Suenson E. Thorsen S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2435-2443Google Scholar). Second, single chain tPA is cleaved by plasmin to generate the two-chain form. Third, plasmin cleaves native Glu1-plasminogen after Lys77 to form Lys78-plasminogen, which is a better substrate for tPA (28Fredenburg J.C. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26150-26156Google Scholar). Formation of Lys78-plasminogen is, in turn, stimulated by partially degraded, but not native, fibrin. In the present study, we adapted a methodology previously described by Horrevoets and co-workers (29Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2176-2182Google Scholar) that allows plasminogen activation to be measured directly in a fibrin clot and in the absence of positive feedback reactions catalyzed by plasmin. Briefly, a recombinant variant of human Glu1-plasminogen, in which the active site serine has been replaced by cysteine, was employed such that the zymogen could be labeled with a thiol-specific fluorescein tag. The labeled protein remains catalytically inactive upon cleavage by tPA. Using a series of recombinant apo(a) (r-apo(a)) variants in this system, we have delineated the domains in apo(a) required for inhibition of plasminogen activation and have described the inhibition mechanism as an equilibrium template model.

Dialysis tubing (6–8 kDa MWCO), dithiothreitol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8,000 were from Fisher. PEG 20,000 was from Fluka (Seelze, Germany). tPA (Activase) was generously provided by Dr. Gordon Vehar (Genentech, South San Francisco, CA). Units of citrated, fresh frozen, human plasma were from Kingston General Hospital (Kingston, ON, Canada). Mammalian cell culture media, sera, and reagents were from Invitrogen. 5-Iodoacetamidofluorescein was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). ϵ-Aminocaproic acid (ϵ-ACA), β-alanine, DEAE-cellulose Fast Flow resin, DEAE-cellulose fibrous form resin, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and reduced GSH were from Sigma. Human Lp(a) was purified from plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation and gel filtration chromatography as previously described (30Edelstein C. Hinman J. Marcovina S. Scanu A.M. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 288: 201-208Google Scholar). Human plasmin and thrombin were prepared from plasma-derived plasminogen and prothrombin, respectively, as described previously (31Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Google Scholar). Construction, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Apo(a) Variants—The construction and expression of the various r-apo(a) variants utilized in our study have been described previously (10Gabel B.R. May L.F. Marcovina S.M. Koschinsky M.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1559-1567Google Scholar, 11Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7892-7898Google Scholar, 21Sangrar W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32096-32104Google Scholar), with the following exception. For construction of the 17K r-apo(a) variant lacking the KV domain (17K(–V) variant), the pRK5ha17 plasmid (32Koschinsky M.L. Tomlinson J.E. Zioncheck T.F. Schwartz K. Eaton D.L. Lawn R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5044-5051Google Scholar) was digested with AvrII and BstEII, thereby generating three fragments of 9974, 1018, and 660 bp. The 660-bp fragment (encoding the apo(a) KIV10, KV, and P domains) was replaced with a 425-bp PCR product containing the apo(a) KIV10 and P domain, but lacking the kringle V domain, as follows. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from baboon liver as previously described (34Belczewski A.R. Laplaud P.M. Chapman M.J. Koschinsky M.L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 271-274Google Scholar), and reverse transcribed using random hexanucleotide primers to generate first-strand cDNA. Using the baboon liver cDNA as template, PCR amplification was performed using the following primers: primer A (5′-CCAAGCCTAGGGGCTCCTTCTGAACAA-3′) flanking the AvrII site at nucleotide position 324 in the human KIV10 sequence (5McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W-H. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Google Scholar) and primer B (5′-TCCGGTCGGTGACCACATAATTTGGGG-3′) flanking the BstEII site in the apo(a) protease-like domain (5McLean J.W. Tomlinson J.E. Kuang W-H. Eaton D.L. Chen E.Y. Fless G.M. Scanu A.M. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1987; 330: 132-137Google Scholar). A 425-bp PCR product was obtained and cloned into pBluescript SK+ for DNA sequence analysis. The resultant sequence was found to correspond to baboon apo(a) and contained the 3′ end of the sequence encoding apo(a) KIV10, followed by the apo(a) protease-like domain. 2A. R. Belczewski and M. L. Koschinsky, unpublished results. The 425-bp PCR product was digested with AvrII and BstEII and ligated with the 9974- and 1018-bp pRK5ha17-derived BstEII/AvrII fragments. The final expression plasmid encoding the 17K(–V) r-apo(a) variant was designated pRK5ha17(–V). It should be noted that the AvrII site resides in the region encoding the inter-kringle region. Thus, KIV10 in the 17K(–V) construct consists entirely of human sequence. The identity of all r-apo(a) variants, including 17K(–V), have been verified by DNA sequence analysis. All r-apo(a) derivatives were purified from the conditioned medium of stably expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cell lines by affinity chromatography as described previously (11Gabel B.R. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7892-7898Google Scholar, 21Sangrar W. Gabel B.R. Boffa M.B. Walker J.B. Hancock M.A. Marcovina S.M. Horrevoets A.J.G. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10353-10363Google Scholar). Briefly, conditioned medium (Opti-MEM) harvested every 3 days from the stably transfected cells was loaded over a 50-ml lysine-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in PBS. The column was washed extensively with PBS containing 500 mm NaCl and r-apo(a) was eluted with 200 mm ϵ-ACA in the same buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed extensively against HBS, and concentrated using PEG 20000. Aliquots of the purified proteins were stored at –70 °C. All r-apo(a) protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (corrected for Rayleigh scattering) using the following molecular weights and extinction coefficients (21Sangrar W. Gabel B.R. Boffa M.B. Walker J.B. Hancock M.A. Marcovina S.M. Horrevoets A.J.G. Nesheim M.E. Koschinsky M.L.

All purified r-apo(a) preparations exhibited single bands under both non-reduced and reduced conditions and migrated at the expected molecular weights. Preparation of Fluorescently Labeled Recombinant Plasminogen— The construction and expression of a variant of native Glu1-plasminogen, containing an active site serine to cysteine mutation (rplasminogen(S741C)), has been described previously (29Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2176-2182Google Scholar). Likewise, r-plasminogen(S741C) protein was purified from the conditioned medium of stably expressing baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells as described previously (29Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2176-2182Google Scholar), but with modifications. Briefly, conditioned medium (Opti-MEM) containing 50 μm ZnCl2 was harvested from the stably transfected cells every 2 days and treated with reduced GSH (1 mm final), Tris, pH 8.0 (10 mm final), and dEGR-CK (1 μm final). Pooled harvests were loaded onto a 40-ml lysine-Sepharose column pre-equilibrated in PBS. The column was washed extensively with PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and r-plasminogen(S741C) was eluted with 20 mm ϵ-ACA in the same buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and then fluorescein-labeled by incubation with a 50-fold molar excess of 5′-iodoacetamidofluorescein at 4 °C overnight in the dark. Free 5′-iodoacetamidofluorescein label was subsequently removed by passage over an 8-ml DEAE-cellulose Fast Flow column pre-equilibrated in PBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80 (PBST). Labeled protein (Flu-plasminogen) recovered in the flow-through was dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80 and then loaded over a similar DEAE column (30 ml) pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed extensively with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and Flu-plasminogen was eluted in HBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80 (HBST). Protein-containing fractions were pooled and aliquots were stored in the dark at –70 °C. All chromatographic and dialysis steps were performed in the dark at 4 °C. The amount of fluorescein incorporated was determined spectrophotometrically as previously described (29Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2176-2182Google Scholar); labeling efficiency was typically greater than 80%. The Flu-plasminogen protein was assessed for purity by SDS-PAGE under non-reduced and reduced (containing 10 mm dithiothreitol) conditions, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. All purified Flu-plasminogen preparations exhibited single bands under both non-reduced and reduced conditions and migrated at the expected molecular weight. Purification of Human Fibrinogen and Non-cross-linked FDPs—Fibrinogen was purified from units of citrated, fresh frozen, human plasma as described previously (35Straughn W. Wagner R.H. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1966; 16: 198-206Google Scholar), but with modifications. Briefly, all steps were performed at room temperature with the exception of the final dialysis performed at 4 °C. Initially, 80 ml of 1.0 m BaCl2 was added to 1.0 liter of plasma over 5 min with stirring. The solution was stirred for an additional 30 min and then centrifuged at 5000 × g for 30 min. A 1.0 m stock of diisopropyl fluorophosphate was added to the supernatant (to 1 mm final) and stirred for 10 min. A 4.0 m β-alanine stock in TSC buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) was then added to the solution over 5 min with stirring (to 1.0 m final), stirred an additional 30 min, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 30 min. β-Alanine was added to the supernatant again (to 2.0 m final), stirred, and centrifuged as before. The pellet was dissolved in 1.0 liter of TSC buffer and β-alanine added again (to 2.0 m final), stirred, and centrifuged as before. The pellet was dissolved in 250 ml of TSC buffer and PEG 8000 (40% (w/v) stock in water) was added to the solution over 15 min with stirring (to 1.2% final), stirred an additional 30 min, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 30 min. PEG 8000 was added to the supernatant again over 15 min with stirring (to 5.0% final), stirred an additional 30 min, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in 100 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl by rapid agitation on an orbital shaker table for 2 h. Subsequently, the 100-ml solution was diluted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (to 25 mm NaCl final), before passage over 5-ml lysine-Sepharose and 100-ml DEAE-cellulose fibrous form columns. Both columns were pre-equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl and were linked in tandem. The columns were washed with 50 ml of the same equilibration buffer and the DEAE column was disconnected and washed further with 300 ml of the same buffer. Fibrinogen was eluted from the DEAE column using 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl and further fractionated to yield high molecular weight fibrinogen (containing intact α-chains) by precipitation with 19% ammonium sulfate as described previously (36Holm B. Nilsen D.W.T. Kierulf P. Godal H.C. Thromb. Res. 1985; 37: 165-176Google Scholar). The purified fibrinogen was dialyzed extensively against HBS, passed through a 5-μm syringe filter, and aliquots were stored at –70 °C. Non-cross-linked FDPs were prepared by plasmin-mediated lysis of fibrin clots as described previously (37Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Rischke J.A. Bajzar L. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26612-36620Google Scholar), but with modifications. Briefly, all steps were performed at room temperature with the exception of the final dialysis performed at 4 °C. In HBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80 (HBST), 50 mg of fibrinogen was clotted with 5 mm CaCl2 and 20 nm thrombin in the presence of 20 nm plasmin. Clot formation (occurred within 1 min) and subsequent fibrinolysis were monitored spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. The reaction was allowed to proceed to ∼75% total lysis and then terminated by the addition of VFK-CK (5 μm final) and PPA-CK (1 μm final). Remaining aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The resultant FDPs were finally dialyzed extensively against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, passed through a 5-μm syringe filter, and stored at 4 °C. Fibrinogen and FDP protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (corrected for Rayleigh scattering) using the following molecular weights and extinction coefficients (38Dellenback R.J. Chien S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1970; 134: 353-355Google Scholar, 39Olexa S.A. Budzynski A.Z. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 991-995Google Scholar) for fibrinogen (Mr ∼ 340,000; ∈180 nm1%=16.0 and FDP (Mr ∼ 250,000; ∈180 nm1%=16.0). The proteins were assessed for purity by SDS-PAGE under non-reduced and reduced (containing 10 mm dithiothreitol) conditions, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Purified high molecular weight fibrinogen (Mr ∼ 340,000) exhibited a single, homogeneous band under non-reduced conditions and characteristic Aα-(Mr ∼ 64,000), Bβ-(Mr ∼ 57,000), and γ-(Mr ∼ 48,000) chain bands under reduced conditions. Subsequent conversion of fibrinogen into non-cross-linked FDPs showed that the final mixture exhibited characteristic fragment X (Mr ∼ 260,000), Y (Mr ∼ 160,000), and D (Mr ∼ 100,000) bands under non-reduced conditions and characteristic β- and γ-chain bands only under reduced conditions. Fluorescent Plasminogen Activation Assays—Cleavage of Flu-plasminogen by tPA was followed at room temperature in 96-well Microfluor2 plates (Dynex), pre-equilibrated with HBS containing 1% (v/v) Tween 80 for 1 h to prevent protein adsorption to the plastic. LinbroR plate sealers (ICN, Montreal, PQ, Canada) were placed over the 96-well plates to prevent evaporation in the wells and fluorescence was monitored using a SpectraMax Gemini XS plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For all studies, the method parameters were as follows: excitation wavelength, 495 nm; emission wavelength, 535 nm; cut-off wavelength, 530 nm; sensitivity setting, normal; PMT setting, low; run time, 1 h; interval, 36 s. In all cases, raw fluorescence measurements were corrected for the buffer blank (HBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80) and corrected for internal filter effects as follows. First, standard Flu-plasminogen curves were generated (0–3 μm) for each purified preparation and fit by non-linear regression (SYSTAT, Evanston, IL) to Equation 1, I=i×[P]×exp(−a×I/i) (Eq. 1) where I is the relative fluorescence intensity, i is the amount of fluorescence per mole of Flu-plasminogen, [P] is the concentration of Flu-plasminogen, a is the exponential coefficient, and I is the raw fluorescence measured. The input data for the non-linear regression were [P] and I and the best-fit parameters returned were a and i. Second, all raw fluorescence measurements were converted to corrected values according to Equation 2 using the appropriate best fit a and i parameters, Icorr=Iraw×exp(a/i×Iraw)(Eq. 2) where Icorr is the corrected fluorescence intensity, Iraw is the measured fluorescence intensity, a is the exponential coefficient, and i is the amount of fluorescence per mole of Flu-plasminogen. Initial rates of fluorescence decrease were then determined by linear regression analysis and converted to rates of plasminogen activation according to Equation 3, d[Pn]/dt=(dI/dt)(1/(r×I0))([P]0/[A]0)(Eq. 3) where d[Pn]/dt is the rate of plasmin formation per mole of tPA (s–1), dI/dt is the initial rate of fluorescence decrease, r is the relative maximum change in fluorescence intensity (0.5 for fibrin surface (29Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2176-2182Google Scholar) and 0.4–0.5 as determined empirically for FDP solution), I0 is the initial fluorescence intensity, [P]0 is the initial Flu-plasminogen (substrate) concentration, and [A]0 is the initial tPA (activator) concentration. In all cases, rates of plasminogen activation reported represent the average of duplicate measurements. For apo(a) domain studies with fibrin as the cofactor, 80-μl volumes containing Flu-plasminogen (0.3–1.8 μm final), fibrinogen (3.0 μm final), and Lp(a) or r-apo(a) (0-1.4 μm final) in HBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80 (HBST) were added to wells already containing 20-μl volumes of CaCl2 (10 mm final), thrombin (6 nm final), and tPA (5 nm final) in HBST. For apo(a) domain studies with FDP as the cofactor, 80-μl volumes containing Flu-plasminogen (0.1–0.6 μm final), FDP (0.6 μm final), and Lp(a) or r-apo(a) (0–1.4 μm final) in HBST were added to wells already containing 20-μl volumes of tPA (3 nm final) in HBST. Compared with Flu-plasminogen cleavage in the absence of Lp(a)/apo(a), percent inhibition (of plasminogen activation) values w"

To identify highly specific ligands for these dendritic cell receptors, oligosaccharides were converted into glycosynthons (Os1) and were used to prepare oligolysine-based glycoclusters, Os-[Lys(Os)]n-Ala-Cys-NH2. Clusters containing two to six dimannosides as well as clusters containing four or five pentasaccharides (Lewisa or Lewisx) or hexasaccharides (Lewisb) were synthesized. The thiol group of the appended cysteine residue allows easy tagging by a fluorescent probe or convenient substitution with an antigen. Surface plasmon resonance was used to determine the affinity of the different glycoclusters for purified mannose receptor and DC-SIGN, whereas flow cytometry and confocal microscopy analysis allowed assessment of cell uptake of fluoresceinyl-labeled glycoclusters. Dimannoside clusters are recognized by the mannose receptor with an affinity constant close to 106 liter·mol–1 but have a very low affinity for DC-SIGN (less than 104 liter·mol–1). Conversely, Lewis clusters have a higher affinity toward DC-SIGN than toward the mannose receptor. Dimannoside clusters are efficiently taken up by human dendritic cells as well as by rat fibroblasts expressing the mannose receptor but not by HeLa cells or rat fibroblasts expressing DC-SIGN; DC-SIGN-expressing cells take up Lewis clusters. The results suggest that ligands containing dimannoside clusters can be used specifically to target the mannose receptor, whereas ligands containing Lewis clusters will be targeted to DC-SIGN.

The results suggest that ligands containing dimannoside clusters can be used specifically to target the mannose receptor, whereas ligands containing Lewis clusters will be targeted to DC-SIGN. Dendritic cells are efficient antigen-presenting cells central to cellular immune responses (1Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Google Scholar). Internalized antigens are processed within the endosomal/lysosomal pathway for subsequent formation of MHC 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; Os, glycosynthons; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DABCO, 1,4- diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane; ICAM-3, intercellular adhesion molecule 3; DC-SIGN, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Glp, pyroglutamic acid; Flu, fluorescein-labeled; GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage cell-stimulating factor; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Rho, rhodamine Red-X™-labeled; RU, resonance units; CRDs, C-type carbohydrate recognition domains; Man, mannose; OBzl, O-benzyl ester. class II peptide complexes. Dendritic cell vaccination to elicit cellular responses rather than humoral responses requires peptide presentation with MHC I. Antigenic peptide loading onto class I MHC molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum requires the generation of peptides by the cytosolic proteasome and subsequent peptide transport into the endoplasmic reticulum. Dendritic cells express several endocytic receptors, including membrane lectins such as the mannose receptor and DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin) that may be used to increase antigen presentation (2Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. Adema G.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 77-84Google Scholar). The mannose receptor, first characterized in macrophages (3Stahl P.D. Rodman J.S. Miller M.J. Schlesinger P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1399-1403Google Scholar), binds and takes up glycoproteins and glycoconjugates containing terminal mannose, GlcNAc, or fucose (4Shepherd V.L. Lee Y.C. Schlesinger P.H. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1019-1022Google Scholar). Calcium-dependent recognition of these sugars is mediated by C-type carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) in the extracellular region of the receptor (5Mullin N.P. Hitchen P.G. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5668-5681Google Scholar). Glycoproteins internalized by the mannose receptor follow a well characterized endocytic path-way leading to lysosomes (6Stahl P.D. Wileman T.E. Diment S. Shepherd V.L. Biol. Cell. 1984; 51: 215-218Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of the mannose receptor contains a tyrosine-based motif involved in the internalization process in association with clathrin-coated vesicles, and the mannose receptor traffics through early endosomes. Our experiments with fluorescein-labeled neoglycoproteins suggested that the mannose receptor is also expressed on monocyte-derived dendritic cells (7Avrameas A. McIlroy D. Hosmalin A. Autran B. Debré P. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Midoux P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 394-400Google Scholar), and this finding was subsequently confirmed (8Engering A.J. Cella M. Fluitsma D.M. Hoefsmit E.C. Lanzavecchia A. Pieters J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 417: 183-187Google Scholar). Recently, DC-SIGN, a new dendritic cell-specific membrane lectin was characterized (9Geijtenbeek T.B. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C. Adema G.J. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Cell. 2000; 100: 575-585Google Scholar). DC-SIGN binds the gp120 envelope glycoprotein on the surface of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (10Curtis B.M. Scharnowske S. Watson A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8356-8360Google Scholar). Its extracellular domain is a tetramer stabilized by an α-helical stalk, whereas its C-type CRDs bind high mannose oligosaccharides (11Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Google Scholar). The presence of an internalization motif in its cytoplasmic tail suggests that DC-SIGN acts as an endocytic receptor, and it has been shown that complexes of DC-SIGN with an anti DC-SIGN antibody are targeted to late endosomes/lysosomes (12Engering A. Geijtenbeek T.B. van Vliet S.J. Wijers M. van Liempt E. Demaurex N. Lanzavecchia A. Fransen J. Figdor C.G. Piguet V. van Kooyk Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2118-2126Google Scholar). Therefore, in dendritic cells that express both the mannose receptor and DC-SIGN, the trafficking of an internalized glycosylated ligand will depend on its relative ability to bind each of these lectins. In search of synthetic ligands suitable for use in human therapy, we selected chemically defined compounds that should have low molecular weight and be recognized by either the mannose receptor or DC-SIGN with high affinity. Accordingly, we developed sugar clusters using disaccharides (13Bédouet L. Bousser M.T. Frison N. Boccaccio C. Abastado J.P. Marceau P. Mayer R. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Biosci. Rep. 2001; 21: 839-855Google Scholar, 14Frison N. Marceau P. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Mayer R. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 111-119Google Scholar). These small multivalent synthetic glycopeptides were made by coupling glycosynthons (diglycosylpyroglutamyl-β-alanine derivatives (15Quétard C. Bourgerie S. Normand-Sdiqui N. Mayer R. Strecker G. Midoux P. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Bioconjug. Chem. 1998; 9: 268-276Google Scholar)) onto a peptide containing up to five lysine residues. Such glycoclusters have previously been shown to bind various lectins with a high specificity. Glycoclusters containing lactose are taken up by HepG2 cells (13Bédouet L. Bousser M.T. Frison N. Boccaccio C. Abastado J.P. Marceau P. Mayer R. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Biosci. Rep. 2001; 21: 839-855Google Scholar), a human hepatoma cell line expressing the galactose-specific lectin (16Schwartz A.L. Fridovich S.E. Knowles B.B. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8878-8881Google Scholar) but not by dendritic cells, whereas those containing dimannosides are taken up avidly by dendritic cells but not by HepG2 cells (14Frison N. Marceau P. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Mayer R. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 111-119Google Scholar). This study describes the use of a series of glycoclusters made of di- or oligosaccharides containing either mannose or fucose to identify the best ligands to allow selective recognition by either the mannose receptor or DC-SIGN. Surface plasmon resonance was used to determine glycocluster affinity for the purified lectins immobilized on sensor chips. Flow cytometry was used to examine glycocluster endocytosis by cells expressing either the mannose receptor or DC-SIGN. Materials—Lactose was purchased from Janssen Chimica (Beerse, Belgium); oligomannoses (α2 mannobiose, α3 mannobiose, and α6 mannobiose) were from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, UK). Lewisa, Lewisx, and Lewisb oligosaccharides were kindly donated by Gérard Strecker (F-Lille). Flu-neoglycoproteins were prepared by coupling bovine serum albumin (BSA) with phenylisothiocyanate monosaccharides and disaccharides and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (17Roche A.C. Barzilay M. Midoux P. Junqua S. Sharon N. Monsigny M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 22: 131-140Google Scholar, 18Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Midoux P. Biol. Cell. 1984; 51: 187-196Google Scholar). The number of sugar residues bound per BSA, determined by the resorcinol sulfuric acid micromethod (19Monsigny M. Petit C. Roche A.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 525-530Google Scholar), under conditions of optimal affinity and specificity, was found to be 25 ± 3. In addition, to assess the clustering effect, Man-BSA containing about 17 mannose residues was also used. Chromatography—Conjugates were purified by gel filtration on a column (2 × 45 cm) of either Trisacryl GF05 (Biosepra, Villeneuve-la-Garenne, France), stabilized and eluted with distilled water containing 5% n-butanol, or BioGel (P2, P4, or P6 from Bio-Rad, Oxfordshire, England), stabilized and eluted with 50 mm acetic acid. The flow rate was 0.35 ml/min. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed on a Waters 2690 apparatus (Milford, MA) linked to a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector. For glycosynthon analysis, a 5-μm LC-NH2 (4.6 × 250 mm) column was stabilized and eluted with acetonitrile/water (84/16, v/v) at 35 °C. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. For glycocluster analysis, a Vydac 5-μm C4 (4.6 × 250 mm) column (Hesperia, CA) was stabilized at 35 °C in the starting eluent: 2% of solvent B (acetonitrile 95%/water 5%/trifluoroacetic acid 0.1%) in solvent A (water 95%/acetonitrile 5%/trifluoroacetic acid 0.1%). Upon injection, the compounds were eluted using this mixture for 5 min and then a linear gradient of 2–15% solvent B in solvent A over 15 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. 1H NMR Spectroscopy—For 1H NMR analysis, compounds were dis-solved at room temperature in deuterated water, once with D2O containing 99.9% D, and, after freeze-drying, with D2O containing 99.96% D (Sigma). 1H NMR spectroscopy was performed at 300 K with a Varian Unity 500 MHz NMR spectrometer. Synthesis and Characterization of Oligosaccharyl-Glp-βAla-OH— The first step was to synthesize the glycosynthon oligosaccharyl-Glp-βAla-OH (15Quétard C. Bourgerie S. Normand-Sdiqui N. Mayer R. Strecker G. Midoux P. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Bioconjug. Chem. 1998; 9: 268-276Google Scholar) in a one-pot, two-step reaction, by coupling an oligosaccharide with a protected dipeptide H-Glu-βAla-OBzl in the presence of imidazole followed by intramolecular acylation to stabilize the glycosylamine formed. After purification on Trisacryl column, the glycosynthon was deprotected by catalytic hydrogenation. The glycosynthons synthesized from lactose and mannobioses, Manα2Man, Manα3Man, and Manα6Man, are fully described in Frison et al. (14Frison N. Marceau P. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Mayer R. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 111-119Google Scholar). The same procedures were followed for the synthesis of glycosynthons from Lewisa/Lewisx oligosaccharides and Lewisb oligosaccharide. Lewisa and Lewisx oligosaccharides (Galβ3(Fucα4)GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glc and Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAcβ3Galβ4Glc) (Fig. 1) were isolated as a mixture from biological fluids that included human milk. However, because they behave almost identically in most chromatographic systems, it is difficult to obtain a pure preparation of each. Remarkably, we found that they were easily separated by HPLC as glycosynthons (Galβ3(Fucα4)G-lcNAcβ3Galβ4Glc-Glp-βAla-OBzl and Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAcβ3Galβ4G-lc-Glp-βAla-OBzl) after substitution of the terminal reducing sugar by a short peptide (pyroglutamyl-β-alanyl-O-benzyl ester) (20Frison N. Meunier L. Marceau P. Quétard C. Roche A.C. Mayer R. Monsigny M. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 47-51Google Scholar). Consequently, we were able to prepare and use the pure Lewisa and Lewisx glycosynthons. Synthesis and Characterization of Oligosaccharyl-Glp-βAla-[Lys(oligosaccharyl-Glp-βAla-)]n-Ala-Cys(Flu)-NH2—As described previously (14Frison N. Marceau P. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Mayer R. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 111-119Google Scholar), the purified glycosynthons were linked through an amide bond to α- and ϵ-amino groups of the lysine residues of a peptide core Lysn-Ala-Cys(SPy)NH2 (with n = 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5)(Fig. 2). The resulting glycoclusters, oligosaccharyl-Glp-βAla-[Lys(oligosaccharyl-Glp-βAla-)]n-Ala-Cys(SPy)-NH2, were purified on a BioGel column and analyzed by HPLC and by 1H NMR to control the substitution. The cysteine residue was used to label the glycocluster: the thiol group was made free in the presence of Tris-(2-catboxyethyl)phosphine and then substituted by reaction with iodoacetamidofluorescein under nitrogen in a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (at pH 7.2, to avoid the formation of dimers), leading to oligosaccharyl-Glp-βAla-[Lys(oligosaccharyl-Glp-βAla-)]n-Ala-Cys(Flu)-NH2. All molecules were characterized by HPLC and 1H NMR. Production of Cells Expressing DC-SIGN or the Mannose Receptor— HeLa cells transiently expressing DC-SIGN were produced by transfection of full-length cDNA (21Soilleux E.J. Barten R. Trowsdale J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2937-2942Google Scholar), tagged with an AU1 epitope tag introduced in the extracellular 3′ region of the plasmid. HeLa human carcinoma cells (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Clontech), 2 mm l-alanylglutamine (Invitrogen), 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) (complete medium). HeLa cells or rat fibroblasts were seeded 1 day before transfection at 1.5 × 105 cells per well in a 24-well culture plate or 106 cells in a 6-cm diameter Petri dish. ExGen 500 (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France), a linear polyethyleneimine (22 kDa), was used to transfect the cells (22Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Google Scholar). 10 μl of ExGen diluted in 40 μl of 150 mm NaCl was added dropwise under vortex to plasmid DNA (1 μg from a 1 mg/ml DNA solution, diluted in 50 μlof150 mm NaCl). This mixture was kept for 10 min at room temperature to allow complex formation, then 100 μl of serum-free DMEM medium was added, and this final mixture was poured into each well (1.5 cm in diameter). Following incubation for 3 h at 37 °C in a CO2 humidified atmosphere, the medium was discarded, complete medium containing serum was added, and cells were further incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. In some experiments a large number of cells was transfected in Petri dishes, and, after a 24-h incubation, cells were released by trypsin-EDTA treatment; 2 × 105 cells were either put in 24-well plates for flow cytometry analysis or on glass coverslips for confocal microscopy analysis and incubated for a further 24 h before uptake experiments. As a control of transfected cells, we used cDNA (pMR60Δ378Myc-His) (23Carrière V. Piller V. Legrand A. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 995-1002Google Scholar) encoding the myc-tagged truncated intracellular mannose-specific lectin MR60/ERGIC-53 (24Arar C. Carpentier V. Le Caer J.P. Monsigny M. Legrand A. Roche A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3551-3553Google Scholar). Production of stably transfected rat fibroblast cell lines expressing the human mannose receptor using retroviral infection has been described previously (25Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Google Scholar). The cell line used in this study was produced using the same method. Mannose receptor expression in this line is approximately twice as high as in the transfected cell line described originally, as assessed by pulse labeling and immunoprecipitation with an anti-mannose receptor antibody and uptake of 125I-labeled mannose-BSA. 2C. E. Napper and M. E. Taylor, unpublished observations. Dendritophages—These were kindly provided by J. P. Abastado (Immuno Designed Molecules, Paris). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from apheresis from healthy volunteers (on average, 1010 peripheral blood mononuclear cells), washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cultured for 7 days in nonadherent hydrophobic bags (Sdedim, Aubagne, France) in serum-free AIM-V medium (VacCell medium, IDM Life Technologies, France), which was supplemented with 500 units/ml GM-CSF and 50 ng/ml IL-13, at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Fresh IL-13 was added on day 4 of culture. On day 7, dendritophages were isolated by elutriation (26Goxe B. Latour N. Chokri M. Abastado J.P. Salcedo M. Immunol. Invest. 2000; 29: 319-336Google Scholar). The purity of dendritophages ranged from 75 to 95%, and their viability was in all cases greater than 95%. Dendritophages were plated at 4 × 105 per well in 24-well culture plates and used 3 days after elutriation. Flow Cytometry Analysis of Endocytosis—Plated cells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in complete culture medium in the presence of the fluorescein-labeled conjugates (1.33 nm to 1.3 μm (0.1–100 μg/ml) Fluneoglycoprotein, 1–10 μm glycoclusters). After washing in PBS, cells were either recovered by trypsin-EDTA treatment for direct flow cytometry analysis or further incubated with a specific antibody to visualize the membrane lectin (see below, immunofluorescence). Cell suspensions were incubated for a further 30 min at 4 °C in the presence or in the absence of 50 μm monensin (18Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Midoux P. Biol. Cell. 1984; 51: 187-196Google Scholar, 27Midoux P. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Cytometry. 1987; 8: 327-334Google Scholar), and the cell-associated fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry. To look for specific uptake of fluoresceinated conjugates, cells were preincubated for 30 min in the presence of fluorescein-free Man-BSA (1 mg/ml) as previously described (7Avrameas A. McIlroy D. Hosmalin A. Autran B. Debré P. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Midoux P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 394-400Google Scholar), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h in the presence of both 1 mg/ml fluorescein-free Man-BSA and a fluorescein-labeled conjugate. Cell-associated fluorescence was assessed using a BD-LSR flow cytometer, and the data were analyzed with Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). In the case of DC-SIGN, the fluorescein fluorescence intensity reported is that of cells expressing DC-SIGN as evidenced by their labeling with an anti-AU1 antibody. Immunofluorescence—DC-SIGN-expressing cells were visualized using mouse monoclonal anti-AU1 epitope tag (RDI, Flanders). Cell surface DC-SIGN was labeled either by incubating living cells or cells fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde with anti-AU1 (1/300, 45 min at room temperature) followed by incubation with R-phycoerythrin conjugated to a goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin-specific polyclonal antibody (1/ 100) (BD Biosciences/Pharmingen, labeled anti-mouse immunoglobulin) for flow cytometry analysis or rhodamine Red™-X conjugated to an AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) antibody (1/100) for confocal microscopy analysis. The myc-tagged truncated MR60 was detected using anti-myc antibodies (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) following fixation and permeabilization of cells with saponin (0.1% saponin in PBS-glycine, 20 min at room temperature) (23Carrière V. Piller V. Legrand A. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 995-1002Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy Analysis—Cells were fixed at 37 °C in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Coverslips were mounted on slides in a PBS/glycerol mixture (1:1 v/v) containing 1% 1,4- diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) as an anti-fading agent (28Johnson G.D. Davidson R.S. McNamee K.C. Russell G. Goodwin D. Holborow E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 55: 231-242Google Scholar). Cell fluorescence was analyzed with a confocal imaging system MRC-1024 (Bio-Rad, Ivry sur Seine, France) equipped with a Nikon Optiphot epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and a ×60 Planapo objective (numerical aperture 1.4). The krypton/argon laser was tuned to produce both 488-nm (fluorescein excitation) and 568-nm (rhodamine excitation) wavelengths. Images were recorded with a Kalman filter average of 10–15 images and treated with Adobe Photoshop software. Analysis of Glycocluster Binding to Soluble Mannose Receptor and DC-SIGN Fragments by Surface Plasmon Resonance—A soluble fragment of the human mannose receptor consisting of the eight C-type CRDs (MMR1–8) was produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells as described previously (29Simpson D.Z. Hitchen P.G. Elmhirst E.L. Taylor M.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 403-411Google Scholar, 30Napper C.E. Dyson M.H. Taylor M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14759-14766Google Scholar). This fragment of the receptor contains all of the domains necessary for Ca2+-dependent binding of Man/GlcNAc/Fuc-terminated glycoconjugates and binds such ligands as well as the whole receptor does (29Simpson D.Z. Hitchen P.G. Elmhirst E.L. Taylor M.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 403-411Google Scholar, 31Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 399-404Google Scholar). MMR1–8 was isolated from the medium by affinity chromatography on mannose-substituted Sepharose. A soluble fragment of DC-SIGN consisting of the whole extracellular region was produced by bacterial expression as described previously (11Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Google Scholar). Protein was purified by affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. To compare the affinities of different glycoclusters for the mannose receptor and DC-SIGN, we chose to immobilize the lectins, because previous studies (32Shinohara Y. Kim F. Shimizu M. Goto M. Tosu M. Hasegawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 189-194Google Scholar) have shown that, when a lectin is immobilized, the affinity constant calculated is in good agreement with values obtained using classic methods in solution. Soluble MMR1–8 and DC-SIGN proteins were linked to the sensor chip CM5, starting with lectin concentrations of 10 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate at pH 4.5. Efficient fixation was indicated by a large increase in the refractive index: ΔRU = 5000 for MMR1–8 and ΔRU = 2000 for DC-SIGN. The neoglycoproteins (Man-BSA or Fuc-BSA) in the absence or in the presence of inhibitors were injected in the running buffer (pH 7.4, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 17 mm NaN3, 0.5% P20 (BIAcore surfactant)) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min to avoid mass transfer limitations. Regeneration of the chip was achieved by adding 0.3 m α-methylmannopyranoside to the running buffer for all flow cells. Inhibition constants were derived from experiments using a solution of glycocluster (0.25–25 μm concentration range), containing 0.125 μm Man-BSA or Fuc-BSA neoglycoprotein. These neoglycoprotein concentrations were those that gave the half-maximal value of resonance units (RUmax/2). The procedure to determine RUmax as well as the equations used to analyze row data are fully described in Ref. 33Duverger E. Frison N. Roche A.C. Monsigny M. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 167-179Google Scholar. The number of resonance units (RUs) was obtained from the sensorgrams; RUmax and the affinity constant K were deduced from the linear transformation (1/RU) versus (1/g)α, (1/g)α=(Kα×RUmax)×(1/RU)+(RUmax)−1(Eq. 1) where g is the concentration of the neoglycoprotein expressed as mol·liter–1. The factor α stands for the Sips coefficient (34Sips R. J. Chem. Phys. 1948; 16: 490-495Google Scholar), which takes into account the avidity effect as well as the heterogeneity of the neoglycoprotein (Man-BSA and Fuc-BSA containing between 20 and 30 sugar units) and/or of the surface density of the lectin immobilized on the chip. Data were fitted into a straight line corresponding to the equation, (RUmax×RU−1−1)1/α=(K×g)−1+Ka×(K×g)−1×i(Eq. 2) where i is the concentration of the glycocluster inhibitor expressed as mol·liter–1, and Ka is the association constant of the glycocluster tested. Neoglycoprotein Uptake by Cells Expressing Either the Mannose Receptor or DC-SIGN—Our previous studies have demonstrated the presence of mannose-specific membrane lectins on the surface of human dendritic cells, but the molecules responsible for this binding were not characterized (7Avrameas A. McIlroy D. Hosmalin A. Autran B. Debré P. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Midoux P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 394-400Google Scholar). Using flow cytometry analysis and a panel of fluorescein-labeled neoglycoproteins bearing 25 sugar units (on average), we showed that Fuc-BSA and Man-BSA are the neoglycoproteins most efficiently internalized and Lac-BSA one of the least efficiently internalized (7Avrameas A. McIlroy D. Hosmalin A. Autran B. Debré P. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Midoux P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 394-400Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to study the uptake of such neoglycoproteins by cells expressing either the mannose receptor or DC-SIGN to get more precise insights than can be obtained using immature dendritic cells that are known to express both lectins. Rat fibroblast-derived cell lines stably transfected with the mannose receptor have previously been shown to mediate efficient endocytosis of 125I-labeled mannose-BSA (25Taylor M.E. Conary J.T. Lennartz M.R. Stahl P.D. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12156-12162Google Scholar, 35Taylor M.E. Bezouska K. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1719-1726Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, rat fibroblasts expressing the mannose receptor efficiently took up fluorescein-labeled mannose-BSA bearing on average 25 mannose residues (Flu,Man25-BSA) (Fig. 3). Fucose-BSA (Flu,Fuc25-BSA) was also taken up by the mannose receptor-expressing cells, but the cells did not endocytose lactose-BSA (Flu,Lac25-BSA). The ligands of the mannose receptor are known to be internalized into an acidic compartment (see Ref. 36Stahl P. Schlesinger P.H. Sigardson E. Rodman J.S. Lee Y.C. Cell. 1980; 19: 207-215Google Scholar for a review). This finding was confirmed by the 10- to 20-fold fluorescence intensity increase seen following monensin postincubation of cells expressing the mannose receptor that had previously been incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with Flu,Man25-BSA or Flu,Fuc25-BSA. Monensin is known to neutralize intracellular acidic compartments allowing the recovery of fluorescein fluorescence that is quenched in an acidic environment (37Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 676-681Google Scholar). Thus, the increase in fluorescence intensity seen upon monensin treatment indicated that Flu, Man25-BSA and Flu,Fuc25-BSA internalized by the mannose receptor are routed to an acidic compartment. We have previously shown, using different types of cells, that neoglycoproteins bearing about 25 sugars are specifically recognized by endogenous lectins (18Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Midoux P. Biol. Cell. 1984; 51: 187-196Google Scholar). Higher substitution increases nonspecific binding, and lower substitution leads to inefficient neoglycoprotein binding and consequently to poor uptake by membrane lectins because of the loss of avidity (38Monsigny M. Mayer R. Roche A.C. Carbohydr. Lett. 2000; 4: 35-42Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, in the case of cells expressing the mannose receptor, the cell fluorescence measured upon incubation at 37 °C in the presence of Flu-neoglycoprotein and a postincubation at 4 °C with monensin was higher with Flu, Man25-BSA (1.5-fold) than with Flu,Man17-BSA (data not shown). Neoglycoproteins were not internalized by rat fibroblasts transfected with an empty vector (data not shown). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells differentiate"
https://openalex.org/W1978330093,"By differential screening of a cDNA library from auxin-induced maize coleoptiles we have isolated and characterized a SAUR gene, designated ZmSAUR2, belonging to a not yet characterized subtype of the SAUR family. ZmSAUR2 encodes a 15.3-kDa protein and is specifically induced by auxin in elongating coleoptile tissue but not in primary leaves or in roots. The transcript level rapidly increased within minutes and preceded auxin-stimulated elongation of coleoptile segments. Cycloheximide also induced ZmSAUR2 transcription, as has been shown for other early auxin-induced genes, whereas abscisic acid, brassinolide, ethylene, gibberellic acid, kinetin, and methyl jasmonate did not provoke an increase in ZmSAUR2 mRNA abundance. In pulse-chase experiments using auxin-induced coleoptiles and an anti-ZmSAUR2 antibody we were able to precipitate a protein of the expected molecular mass and to determine a half-life of about 7 min, which is among the shortest known in eukaryotes. In gel shift assays binding of calmodulin to ZmSAUR2 was demonstrated, suggesting the possibility of post-transcriptional regulation. Upon transformation of onion epidermal cells with a ZmSAUR2::GUS construct the corresponding chimeric protein was detected in the nucleus. The results suggest that ZmSAUR2 encodes a short-lived nuclear protein that might be involved in auxin-mediated cell elongation.

The results suggest that ZmSAUR2 encodes a short-lived nuclear protein that might be involved in auxin-mediated cell elongation. The plant hormone auxin influences a variety of processes during plant growth and development, including cell elongation, cell division, differentiation, control of tropisms, and apical dominance. How auxin mediates and controls these effects on a molecular and cellular level is still far from being understood. Besides modulating membrane function it has clearly been demonstrated that auxin is able to cause rapid changes in the expression of a selected set of genes. Several sequences have been described that are up-regulated by auxin (for review, see Refs. 1Abel S. Theologis A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 9-17Google Scholar, 2Sitbon F. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 443-455Google Scholar, 3Hagen G. Guilfoyle T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 373-385Google Scholar). Of major interest are genes that are specifically induced within minutes after auxin application in the absence of protein synthesis and are referred to as early or primary auxin-responsive genes. Three major classes are known: Aux/IAA, SAUR, and GH3 families (for review, see Ref. 3Hagen G. Guilfoyle T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 373-385Google Scholar). It was shown that apart from auxin, Aux/IAA and SAUR genes can also be induced by cycloheximide, and it is assumed that a pool of repressors, rapidly turning over, is involved in their transcriptional regulation. The very low abundance of the derived proteins, their short half-lives (as far as analyzed), their nuclear localization, and the absence of a catalytic domain point to an involvement in auxin signal transduction and in control of secondary downstream genes. Whereas for Aux/IAA proteins increasing evidence emerges that they act as repressors, including repressing their own transcription (for review, see Ref. 4Leyser O. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 377-398Google Scholar), the function of SAURs still remains obscure, and even the experimental proof at the protein level is missing. SAUR genes (for small auxin up RNA) were originally identified and characterized in soybean (5McClure B.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 611-623Google Scholar) and found to encode a set of unstable transcripts that are induced by auxin within minutes. SAURs are abundant in the zone of elongation in soybean hypocotyls and are expressed most strongly in epidermal and cortical cells (6Gee M.A. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 419-430Google Scholar). Meanwhile SAURs have been identified in a variety of organisms, in Vigna radiata (7Yamamoto K.T. Mori H. Imaseki H. Plant Cell Physiol. 1992; 33: 93-97Google Scholar), Pisum sativum (8Guilfoyle T.J. Hagen G. Li Y. Ulmasov T. Liu Z. Strabala T. Gee M. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 20: 489-502Google Scholar), Arabidopsis thaliana (9Gil P. Liu Y. Orbovic V. Verkamp E. Poff K.L. Green P.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 777-784Google Scholar), Nicotiana tabacum (10Roux C. Bilang J. Theunissen B.H. Perrot-Rechenmann C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 385-389Google Scholar), Raphanus sativus (11Anai T. Kono N. Kosemura S. Yamamura S. Hasegawa K. DNA Seq. 1998; 9: 329-333Google Scholar), Malus domestica (12Watillon B. Kettmann R. Arredouani A. Hecquet J.F. Boxus P. Burny A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 909-915Google Scholar) and more recently also in Zea mays (13Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3137-3143Google Scholar). Genome analysis in A. thaliana reveals more than 70 SAUR homologs, which mostly are found in clusters (3Hagen G. Guilfoyle T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 373-385Google Scholar). However, it is not known how many of them are really expressed and are auxin-inducible. With one exception (AtSAUR11), all SAUR genes appear to lack introns (3Hagen G. Guilfoyle T. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 49: 373-385Google Scholar). SAURs encode unstable mRNAs (14McClure B.A. Guilfoyle T. Science. 1989; 243: 91-93Google Scholar, 15Franco A.R. Gee M.A. Guilfoyle T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15845-15849Google Scholar), and their high turnover rate may be due to a conserved downstream (DST) 1The abbreviations used are: DST, downstream; CaM, calmodulin; GUS, β-glucuronidase; IAA, indole-3-acetic acid; NIa, nuclear inclusion protein a; NLS, nuclear localization signal; SAUR, small auxin up RNA; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. element in the 3′-non-translated region of the mRNA (16McClure B.A. Hagen G. Brown C.S. Gee M.A. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 229-239Google Scholar, 17Newman T.C. Ohme-Takagi M. Taylor C.B. Green P.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 701-714Google Scholar) as well as elements within the coding region (9Gil P. Liu Y. Orbovic V. Verkamp E. Poff K.L. Green P.J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 777-784Google Scholar, 18Gil P. Green P.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1678-1686Google Scholar). There is evidence that SAURs are not only transcriptionally regulated but are also regulated at the post-transcriptional (19Li Y. Strabala T.J. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 715-723Google Scholar) and post-translational levels (13Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3137-3143Google Scholar). Recently it was demonstrated that SAUR proteins bind calmodulin in vitro, pointing to a possible “cross-talk” between the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) second messenger system and auxin signal transduction (13Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3137-3143Google Scholar). Auxin-induced cell elongation of maize coleoptiles is one of the fastest phytohormonal responses known, and this organ has been widely used as a model system to study regulation of cell growth and tropisms (20Evans M.L. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1985; 2: 317-365Google Scholar, 21Ray P.J. Dohrmann U. Hertel R. Plant Physiol. 1977; 60: 585-591Google Scholar, 22Haga K. Iino M. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1473-1486Google Scholar, 23Carpita N.C. Defernez M. Findlay K. Wells B. Shoue D.A. Catchpole G. Wilson R.H. McCann M.C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 551-565Google Scholar, 24Karcz W. Burdach Z. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1089-1098Google Scholar). To detect genes involved in the elongation growth of maize, we carried out a differential screening of a cDNA library from auxin-induced coleoptiles and report here the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone, designated as ZmSAUR2 because of its homology to SAUR genes. ZmSAUR2 shows typical characteristics of primary auxin-responsive genes; it is induced within minutes exclusively by auxin and by the protein biosynthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. In addition, sequence motifs of SAURs, such as nuclear localization (NLS) and DST can be identified. For the first time we succeeded in detecting the corresponding SAUR protein and show that it is very short-lived, having a half-life of 7 min. Coleoptile Preparation and Hormone Induction—Maize kernels were washed, soaked in water for 24 h at room temperature, and grown on wet cellulose at 25 °C in the dark. 24 h before harvest, seedlings were exposed to light for 1 min. Four-day-old etiolated coleoptiles with a length of 2.5–3.5 cm were harvested, subapical segments (10 mm long and 4 mm below the tip) were cut out, and the primary leaf was removed. Segments were incubated in aqueous solution with and without hormones for 100 min at 25 °C on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. To determine the in situ transcript level, one aliquot was frozen immediately after excision. Control segments were incubated in 0.05% methanol and 0.01% ethanol, respectively, depending on how the hormone was dissolved. For the cycloheximide and in vivo labeling experiments the cuticula was abraded with a dry polishing cloth before segments were excised (25Schopfer P. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 202-207Google Scholar). Construction and Screening of the cDNA Library—The Z. mays cv. Brio cDNA library was constructed from 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from auxin-induced coleoptile segments according to Gubler and Hoffman (26Gubler U. Hoffmann B.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 263-269Google Scholar) using a cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Biosciences). EcoRI/NotI adaptors were ligated, and the cDNA was purified by Sepharose CL-4B column chromatography, precipitated, and ligated to dephosphorylated λgt10 arms. λ DNA was packed into λgt10 using the Lambda DNA Packaging System (Promega). Recombinant λgt10 was plated on Escherichia coli C600hfl as a host (plaque density was about 800–1000/87-mm diameter plate). Differential screening was carried out with radiolabeled cDNA from auxin-induced (70–100 min) versus non-induced cells. Hybridization was performed in 50% formamide, 6× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA containing 3 × 107 dpm of 32P-labeled cDNA, and 20 μg/ml polyU at 38 °C for 18 h after 2 h of prehybridization in the same solution without the radiolabeled probe. Filters were washed twice in 2× SSC with 0.1% SDS for 30 min, once in 0.2× SSC with 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 38 °C, and finally, autoradiographed. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from maize coleoptiles as described by Palmiter (27Palmiter R. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3606-3615Google Scholar) with some modifications. Frozen plant material was ground in a mortar under liquid nitrogen. 5 g of the powder was added to 20 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and phenol (equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0)) and homogenized four times for 15 s at 25,000 rpm (Ultra-Turrax T25; IKA-Werke). The mixture was centrifuged to separate the phases (10 min at 2,200 × g), and the phenolic phase was reextracted three more times with 5 ml of Tris-HCl (15 s; 25,000 rpm). The aqueous phase was extracted once more with 10 ml of phenol. Both aqueous phases were combined and again extracted with 10 ml of phenol and finally purified with 10 ml of chloroform. RNA was precipitated overnight with 0.1 volumes of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2.5 volumes of EtOH at –20 °C and centrifuged at 16,000 × g. To purify RNA from polysaccharides the pellet was dissolved in 0.5 ml of H2O treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate, and 5 ml of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added. The RNA was precipitated again and centrifuged at 16000 × g. This step was repeated. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 0.5 ml of H2O treated with diethyl pyrocarbonate, mixed with 4.5 ml 0.3 m NaCl and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 20 min. Finally the RNA in the supernatant was precipitated overnight with 2.5 volumes of EtOH at –20 °C and centrifuged at 16,000 × g. For electrophoresis, 50 μg of RNA was incubated in 10 μl of formamide, 5 μl of formaldehyde, and 4 μl of MOPS buffer (pH 7) for 15 min at 55 °C. After adding 3 μl of loading dye, samples were immediately placed on ice and separated on denaturing 1.4% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde (v/v) gels at 22 V for 12 h and transferred to nitrocellulose (Hybond-C extra). Probes for hybridization were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP using the Megaprime™ DNA Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences). After immobilization at 80 °C for 2 h and prehybridization at 38 °C for 2 h, hybridization was performed at 38 °C for 16 h in 50% formamide, 6× SSC, 1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's, 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and the 32P-labeled cDNA probe. Blots were washed twice with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 40 °C, and labeled bands were visualized by autoradiography. In Vivo Labeling of Maize Coleoptiles with [35S]Methionine/Cysteine and Immunoprecipitation of ZmSAUR2—20 coleoptile segments were incubated in 10 ml of 10 μm IAA and 140 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Promix, Amersham Biosciences) at 25 °C and 120 rpm. After 45 min a further aliquot of 100 μCi was added, and incubated for another 15 min. Coleoptiles were then chased with each 5 mm methionine and cysteine in the presence of 10 μm IAA for the indicated times and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Coleoptiles were ground in a mortar under liquid nitrogen, and the powder was resuspended in 600 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 360 μl of 1.85 m NaOH containing 7.5% CH3CH2SH and kept on ice for 15 min. Then 360 μl of 50% TCA was added, mixed again, and centrifuged at 18,000 × g. The pellet was washed in 1 m Tris base and resuspended in 25 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 1% SDS followed by a 5-min incubation at 95 °C. After adding 1 ml of TNET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) and 30 min of centrifugation at 48,000 × g, antibody was added to the supernatant and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody complex was bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (3 h at 4 °C, by rolling end over end) and washed 4 times with TNET and once with Tris-saline; finally, the antibody was released with SDS sample buffer (5 min, 95 °C). SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Radioactivity was monitored and quantified with an Instant Imager (Packard). For raising a polyclonal antisera a recombinant maltose-binding protein::ZmSAUR2 fusion was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). The C-terminal 366-bp fragment of the coding region of ZmSAUR2 (bp 133–498) was cloned in-frame into pMAL-c2. Antibodies were raised in rabbits against the fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography using the fusion protein immobilized on a HiTrap affinity column. CaM Binding to ZmSAUR2—[35S]-Methionine/cysteine-labeled ZmSAUR2 was produced using the Promega TNT coupled transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system. As template 1 μg of pTR52-DNA (pBS vector with the ZmSAUR2 cDNA as an insert under the control of the T7-promotor) was added and incubated as described in the producer's manual. 1 μl of lysate containing 35S-labeled ZmSAUR2 was incubated with 2 and 0.4 μg of bovine CaM as indicated for 1 h at room temperature in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 1 mm CaCl2 in a total volume of 30 μl. Samples were loaded onto nondenaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels in 375 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.8) and 1 mm CaCl2. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant current of 25 mA in running buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 1 mm CaCl2 followed by autoradiography. Plant Transformation and GUS Staining—For transformation of onion cells epidermal layers were peeled and placed inside-up on Petri dishes containing Chu basal salt mixture powder (Sigma C1416) supplemented with 3% sucrose and 0.7% agar ultrapure. Plant tissue was bombarded with 1.6-μm gold particles coated with DNA by ethanol precipitation using a Biolistic PDS-1000/He particle gun (Bio-Rad). Staining for GUS activity was performed according to Hall et al. (29Hall L.N. Rossini L. Cribb L. Langdale J.A. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 925-936Google Scholar). X-Glucuronide (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide acid, sodium salt; Biosynth AG) was used as substrate. Other Nucleic Acid Techniques—For construction of pBI-221-ZmSAUR2-GUS the ZmSAUR2 coding sequence (without the stop codon) was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame to the GUS gene in pBI 221 (Clontech). Standard procedures for cloning and DNA manipulation were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Isolation of ZmSAUR2 cDNA and Sequence Analysis—In an effort to isolate genes that may be involved in auxin-mediated cell elongation, a cDNA library in λgt10 was constructed from poly(A)-mRNA of subapical excised segments of etiolated maize coleoptiles that were depleted of auxin for 60 min and subsequently induced by 10 μm IAA for 2 h. This library was differentially screened with radiolabeled cDNA probes synthesized from mRNA of excised coleoptile segments floated in 10 μm IAA and water, respectively. Of 50,000 plaques, 42 showed a differential response. After two rounds of rescreening and Southern blot analysis, eight positive clones were left. One of them was further characterized and is designated as ZmSAUR2 because of its homology to the SAUR gene family and its inducibility by auxin. The sequence of the cDNA clone is shown in Fig. 1. The ZmSAUR2 open reading frame of 432 nucleotides (bp 64–495) encodes a polypeptide of 144 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 15.3 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.3. The sequence flanking the first possible ATG is consistent with the consensus context for eukaryotic translation initiation (31Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Google Scholar). Cell-free translation of an in vitro transcript of ZmSAUR2 in a wheat germ extract produced a polypeptide of the expected size (see Fig. 5, lane 1). ZmSAUR2 has neither large hydrophobic domains nor an N-terminal ER signal sequence but has a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) of the type KKX5KKX7RRR (32Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar). Also a conserved casein kinase II phosphorylation site at Ser77 can be identified. In the 3′-non-translated region a putative DST element is present that was shown to be responsible for the rapid decay of SAUR transcripts (17Newman T.C. Ohme-Takagi M. Taylor C.B. Green P.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 701-714Google Scholar, 33Li Y. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 1167-1175Google Scholar).Fig. 5Half-life of ZmSAUR2 protein. An in vitro transcript of ZmSAUR2 was in vitro translated (using the Wheat Germ Lysate System (Promega)), immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified anti ZmSAUR2 antisera, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (lane 1). Coleoptile segments were pulse-labeled in vivo with [35S]methionine/cysteine in the presence of auxin for 60 min and then chased with an excess of unlabeled methionine/cysteine for the times indicated, processed for immunoprecipitation using affinity-purified anti ZmSAUR2 antibody, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (lanes 2–6). Bands were quantified with a scanning Instant-Imager (Packard), and the results are shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of ZmSAUR2 with other protein sequences compiled in databases reveals that ZmSAUR2 can be grouped into a cluster separate from SAURs previously characterized (Fig. 2). In Arabidopsis eight of them are localized to chromosome I (e.g. At1g29430, At1g29450, At1g29460), but also other chromosomes contain members of this subgroup (e.g. At5g27780). Within the AP005862 locus of Oryza sativa an open reading frame can be identified (between bp 54216 and 54651) that has the highest homology to ZmSAUR2, 67%. Most members of this subgroup are composed of about 144 amino acids and are, therefore, larger than the SAURs characterized earlier (e.g. GmSAUR-10A5 with 93 amino acids). The larger size of the ZmSAUR2 subtype is due to N-terminal and C-terminal extensions. In the N-terminal region the identity within the ZmSAUR2 subgroup (Met1-Arg24, numbers refer to ZmSAUR2) amounts to 82%. This domain is not present in the subtype represented by GmSAUR-10A5 (Fig. 2). ZmSAUR1, the only other described SAUR from maize, is as large as ZmSAUR2 and also comprises a long N-terminal extension, but its homology to ZmSAUR2 within this region is rather low. Therefore, it might cluster to a third subgroup. The C-terminal region (67% identity between Asp95-Val144) is a further characteristic for the ZmSAUR2 subtype, although some of its motives are only found in members from Arabidopsis. In contrast, the middle region between Lys45 and Pro93 is not only conserved within the ZmSAUR2 subgroup (77% identity) but also in the subtype represented by GmSAUR-10A5 (∼50%) and in ZmSAUR1 (∼40%). Especially, the EEE(Y/F)G motif (between amino acids 78 and 83) as well as amino acids that might be important for secondary structure, such as Pro, Glu/Asp, or Arg, are highly conserved. Auxin Induction and Tissue-specific Expression of ZmSAUR2 Time Dependence—Northern blot analysis of mRNA from freshly harvested coleoptile segments gives a weak ZmSAUR2 signal that after 60 min of incubation in water is no longer detectable, presumably due to depletion of endogenous auxin (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2). Subsequent addition of 10 μm IAA to the medium leads to a strong increase of the ZmSAUR2 transcript level. Already after 10 min of induction (the earliest time point taken in this experiment) it is higher than the in situ level and increases further within the following 60 min. Bergfeld et al. (34Bergfeld R. Speth V. Schopfer P. Bot. Acta. 1988; 101: 57-67Google Scholar) show that exogenous application of IAA to auxin-depleted coleoptile segments reinduces elongation after a lag period of about 16 min. Thus, ZmSAUR2 transcripts appear before the segments start to elongate. In lane 6, RNA is analyzed from coleoptile segments incubated for an additional 60 min as in lane 5 but in the absence of auxin, and a reappearance of ZmSAUR2 mRNA is observed. This correlates with the restoration of elongation of auxin-depleted coleoptile segments that occurs within 2.5–3 h after excision and is caused by the regeneration of the physiological tip (35Kutschera M. Schopfer P. Planta. 1985; 163: 483-493Google Scholar). Specificity of Auxin Induction—To test the specificity of ZmSAUR2 induction, coleoptile segments were incubated with abscisic acid, kinetin, ethylene, gibberellic acid, brassinolide, or methyl jasmonate as well as with the synthetic, physiologically active auxin analogs α-naphthalene-acetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the physiologically inactive 3,5-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. As shown in Fig. 3B, ZmSAUR2 is only induced by IAA, α-naphthalene-acetic acid, and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, but not by 3,5-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid or any of the other phytohormones. As in the case of other auxin-inducible early genes an accumulation of ZmSAUR2 transcripts could be observed in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX, lane 16). A stop of protein synthesis is assumed to cause the disappearance of a putative repressor of transcription or of a labile nuclease responsible for RNA degradation (1Abel S. Theologis A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 9-17Google Scholar). Alternatively it is also discussed that the translational arrest could prevent the nucleolytic breakdown of the transcripts by a mechanism not clearly understood (36Koshiba T. Ballas N. Wong L.-M. Theologis A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 396-413Google Scholar). It has not yet been tested as to whether mRNA stabilization or activation of transcription is responsible for the increase in ZmSAUR2 transcript level. Indeed, there is evidence for the existence of both mechanisms among SAUR genes (18Gil P. Green P.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1678-1686Google Scholar, 19Li Y. Strabala T.J. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 715-723Google Scholar). Tissue Expression Pattern of ZmSAUR2—As shown in Fig. 4, ZmSAUR2 transcripts could be detected only in the coleoptile and in the mesocotyl but not in the root and in the primary leaf of maize seedlings. Furthermore, the amount of ZmSAUR2 transcripts correlated well with the light-dependent elongation growth of the coleoptile (Fig. 4C, lane 1–3). Thus, Northern blot analysis of RNA from coleoptiles and mesocotyls grown for 5 days in the light or 4 days in the dark plus 1 day in the light displays a decreased ZmSAUR2 mRNA level compared with seedlings that were kept for 5 days exclusively in the dark. This is consistent with the growing behavior of maize coleoptiles and mesocotyls (Fig. 4D). In the first 4 days growth of coleoptiles is independent of exogenous light. After this period light-grown coleoptiles stop elongating, and the primary leaf breaks through the coleoptile, whereas in dark-grown coleoptiles further elongating takes place. In contrast mesocotyl growth is inhibited by light from the beginning. ZmSAUR2 Protein Is Very Short-lived—Metabolic labeling experiments allowed us for the first time to detect a protein of the SAUR gene family in vivo. Auxin-induced coleoptiles were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine and subsequently chased for different times with nonradioactive amino acids as indicated. Coleoptiles were lysed, and the soluble protein fraction, obtained upon centrifugation, was immunoprecipitated by an antiserum raised against ZmSAUR2 and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 5, the protein precipitated by the ZmSAUR2 antisera has an extremely short half-life of about 7 min, similar as the auxin-inducible PS-IAA4 and PS-IAA6 proteins, members of the Aux/IAA family (37Abel S. Oeller P.W. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 326-330Google Scholar). An in vitro transcribed and translated ZmSAUR2 migrated with the same mobility (Fig. 5, lane 1). Therefore, we assume that the precipitated, short-lived protein most probably is ZmSAUR2 (see “Discussion”). Intracellular Localization of ZmSAUR2—The presence of a putative nuclear localization signal (Fig. 1) raised the prospect that ZmSAUR2 resides in the nucleus. To test this, the GUS reporter gene was fused to the 3′ end of the coding sequence of ZmSAUR2 under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter (pBI-221-ZmSAUR2-GUS). The chimeric gene construct was introduced into onion epidermis cells via micro-bombardment, and the intracellular localization of the chimeric ZmSAUR2::GUS protein was determined histochemically. Whereas the GUS protein without ZmSAUR2 did not accumulate in the nucleus (Fig. 6), cells expressing the chimeric construct displayed a predominantly nuclear staining. A similar nuclear accumulation was observed for the nuclear inclusion protein a GUS::NIa fusion, used as a positive control (38Restrepo M.A. Freed D.D. Carrington J.C. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 987-998Google Scholar). The results suggest that the nucleus is probably the cellular compartment in which ZmSAUR2 fulfils its function. ZmSAUR2 Is a Calmodulin-binding Protein—Recently CaM was shown to bind to ZmSAUR1 protein heterologously expressed in E. coli or to synthetic peptides deduced from SAUR sequences (GmSAUR-A5, AtSAUR-AC1), and it was suggested that SAURs in general are CaM-binding proteins (13Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3137-3143Google Scholar). CaM is a protein capable of recognizing a basic amphiphilic α-helical domain of the respective target proteins (39Snedden W.A. Fromm H. New Phytol. 2001; 151: 35-66Google Scholar, 40Snedden W.A. Fromm H. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 299-304Google Scholar, 41Arazi T. Baum G. Snedden W.A. Shelp B.J. Fromm H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 551-561Google Scholar). Secondary structure prediction of the N-terminal sequence of ZmSAUR2 suggests an α-helix at the N-terminal end that in a helical wheel projection (data not shown) shows the typical basic amphiphilic α-helix, similar to CCaMK, a plant Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase (42Takezawa D. Ramachandrian S. Paranjape V. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8126-8132Google Scholar), or to other SAURs (13Yang T. Poovaiah B.W. J. Biol."
https://openalex.org/W2153605568,"The apolipoprotein (apo) E receptor-2 (apoER2) is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family and an important regulator of neuronal migration. It acts as a receptor for the signaling factor Reelin and provides positional cues to neurons that migrate to their proper position in the developing brain. Besides brain formation defects, apoER2-deficient mice also exhibit male infertility. The role of the receptor in male reproduction, however, remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that apoER2 is highly expressed in the initial segment of the epididymis, where it affects the functional expression of clusterin and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), two proteins required for sperm maturation. Reduced PHGPx expression in apoER2 knockout mice results in the inability of the sperm to regulate the cell volume and in abnormal sperm morphology and immotility. Because insufficient expression of PHGPx is a major cause of infertility in men, these findings not only highlight an important new function for apoER2 that is unrelated to neuronal migration, but they also suggest a possible role for apoER2 in human infertility.

Apolipoprotein (apo) E receptor-2 (apoER2) 1The abbreviations used are: apoER2, apolipoprotein E receptor-2; LDL, low density lipoprotein; PHGPx, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase. is a member of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene family and a prototype receptor that acts both in endocytosis and in signal transduction (1Kim D.-H.

In particular, apoER2 functions as a cellular receptor for Reelin, a signaling factor that regulates neuronal migration processes in the embryonic brain. Reelin binds to apoER2 and to the related very low density lipoprotein receptor on the surface of post-mitotic neurons that migrate to their proper position in the developing brain (2Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Google Scholar, 5D'Arcangelo G. Homayouni R. Keshvara L. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. Neuron. 1999; 24: 471-479Google Scholar). Binding of Reelin results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Disabled 1, an adaptor protein bound to the receptor tails, and in activation of down-stream signaling pathways involving the Src family of tyrosine kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (4Beffert U. Morfini G. Bock H.H. Reyna H. Brady S.T. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49958-49964Google Scholar, 6Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 643-648Google Scholar, 7Arnaud L.

Defects in these signaling cascades as in apoER-2-deficient mice cause abnormal layering of neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum (9Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Google Scholar). Aside from post-mitotic neurons in the brain, apoer2 transcripts are also abundant in the placenta, the ovaries, and the epididymis (1Kim D.-H. Iijima H. Goto K. Sakai J. Ishii H. Kim H.-J. Suzuki H.

The function of the receptor in these tissues, however, remains unclear. In the present study, we aimed at elucidating novel roles for apoER2 in tissues other than the brain. We focused our attention on the male reproductive system because apoER2 is highly expressed in the principal cells of the epididymis (3Stockinger W. Brandes C. Fasching D. Hermann M. Gotthardt M. Herz J. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25625-25632Google Scholar) and because receptor-deficient mice suffer from male infertility (9Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Google Scholar). Here we have identified a crucial role for the receptor in sperm maturation, in particular in the acquisition and development of sperm motility. Materials—The generation of apoER2-deficient mice has been described before (9Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Google Scholar). Because of male infertility, the line was bred in-house by mating of homozygous-deficient (apoer2–/–) females with males heterozygous for the receptor gene defect (apoer2+/–). All experiments reported in this study were performed on apoer2+/– and apoer2–/– littermates. As a source for clusterin, we employed conditioned, serum-free medium from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells that secrete large amounts of the protein (11Graichen R. Lösch A. Appel D. Koch-Brandt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15854-15857Google Scholar). A soluble fragment encompassing the extracellular domain of murine apoER2 was expressed as a hexahistidine fusion protein and purified from 293 EBNA cells (Invitrogen) by conventional Ni2+-affinity chromatography. Analysis of Sperm Morphology—For in situ analysis of sperm morphology, the epididymis was prepared, and the mid/distal cauda luminal content was flushed out. The remaining epididymal tissue was immerse-fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde for 1 h and transferred to phosphate-buffered saline solution. The organ was cut into six regions representing initial segment, remaining caput, proximal corpus, mid-corpus, distal corpus, and proximal cauda, and the tangled mass of fixed luminal sperm was dissected from the center of each region. Individual sperm were released by coarse mincing and brief sonication (0.5 s, 25 W, amplitude 20, Vibracell™ Sonicator, Sonics & Materials Inc., Danbury, CT). Wet preparations of sperm were examined at 20× magnification for flagellar angulation and for the presence of abnormal mid-pieces. Analysis of Sperm Motility—For analysis of sperm motility, a tubule segment was dissected from the proximal cauda epididymidis, and the luminal content was transferred into 100 μl of Biggers Whitten Whittingham (BWW) medium (12Yeung C.H. Cooper T.G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 819-828Google Scholar) (osmolality, 400 mmol/kg) containing 12 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Sperm were allowed to disperse for 2 min at 37 °C, further diluted, and loaded onto siliconized slides (40-μm chamber depth) for video recording. Approximately 200 motile sperm were analyzed for kinematics using a computer-assisted sperm analysis system (IVOS, Version 10.8, Hamilton-Thorne Research, Beverly, MA) by tracking each motile cell at 50 frames/s for 60 frames. Kinematic parameters included the vigor of movement (curvilinear velocity), the average swimming velocity (average path velocity), the speed of forward progression (straight line velocity), the amplitude of lateral head displacement, the beat cross frequency, and the linearity of swim path. Percentage motility was counted, and the tail morphology of the motile sperm was assessed and classified as straight, hairpin, or angulated. Electron Microscopy—Sperm were flushed from the cauda epididymidis and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 24 h, post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h, dehydrated, and embedded in Poly/Bed 812 (Polysciences, Inc., Eppelheim, Germany). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a Philips EM 400T at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV. Endocrine Analysis—Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels in the epididymis were determined using specific radioimmunoassay (ICN pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IBL, Hamburg, Germany) according to manufacturers' recommendations after tissue extraction of the steroids by methanol and solid phase extraction procedures. The osmotic pressure of luminal contents in the cauda epididymidis was measured as described before (12Yeung C.H. Cooper T.G. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 819-828Google Scholar). Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE Analysis of Epididymal Sperm and Fluid—Total protein preparations were obtained from flushed caudal sperm or from sperm-free luminal content and dissolved in lysis buffer. Rehydration buffer was added, and the first dimension was run with immobilized pH gradient stripe (3–10L, Amersham Biosciences). The second-dimension run was performed on homemade polyacrylamide gels (12%T - (total solid content), 3%C - (ratio of cross-linker to acrylamide monomer) (13Vorum H. Liu X. Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Honoré B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1386: 121-131Google Scholar) that were fixed in 50% (v/v) methanol, 12% (v/v) acetic acid, and 0.0185% (v/v) formaldehyde, washed in 35% (v/v) ethanol, and stained with silver nitrate. Staining was stopped in 50% (v/v) methanol, 12% (v/v) acetic acid, and the gels were dried between cellophane sheets (14Mortz E. Krogh T.N. Vorum H. Gorg A. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1359-1363Google Scholar). The Melanie software package (Geneva Bioinformatics) was used after scanning the gels for analysis of differences in the protein patterns between genotypes. For identification, protein spots of interest were cut out of the dried gels, hydrated, destained with Farmer's reagent (15Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Google Scholar), reduced, and alkylated before tryptic digestion. Chromatographic separation of the peptide mixture was performed on a LC Packings 75-μm PepMap C18 column (Dionex, Idstein, Germany) using a capillary liquid chromatography system. The eluting peptides were ionized by electrospray ionization on a quadrupole time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) fitted with a Z-spray source. The instrument selects precursor ions based on intensity for peptide sequencing by collision-induced fragmentation tandem mass spectrometry. The mass spectral data were processed into peak lists and correlated with protein databases using Mascot software (16Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Google Scholar). Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed on total RNA samples from heterozygous and apoER2-deficient testis and entire epididymis using Taqman® technology (Applied Biosystems). The quantification was evaluated using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA as reference. The following primers and TaqMan probe were used for amplification of the PHGPx mRNA: forward primer, 5′-CCC GAT ATG CTG AGT GTG GTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCC TGC CTC CCA AAC TGG T-3′; probe Fam 5′-ACG AAT CCT GGC CTT CCC CTG C-3′ Tamra. The results were imported into an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed according to the standard curve method. Clusterin Binding—Binding of clusterin to apoER2 was detected by surface plasmon resonance analysis (BIAcore) using the extracellular domain of murine apoER2 coupled to CM-5 sensor chips (23 fmol/mm2). Analysis of the interaction between clusterin and apoER2 was performed as described for other receptor ligands (17Andersen O.M. Christensen L.L. Christensen P.A. Sørensen E.S. Jacobsen C.

Although male infertility had been noted in the initial characterization of the apoer2 knockout mouse (9Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Google Scholar), little was known about the mechanism causing this defect and about the role of apoER2 in male reproduction. To address this problem, we performed a detailed analysis of the male reproductive tract in receptor-deficient mice. No differences in weight or size of testis and epididymis or in tissue morphology were observed between apoer2–/– animals and control littermates. We analyzed 1000 tubule sections from 12 blocks cut from each face of halved testes from apoer2+/– and apoer2–/– animals. For heterozygotes, there were 91.2 ± 7.3% normal tubules, 2.8 ± 2.2% sections where only Sertoli cells were present, 5.8 ± 5.7% with spermatid arrest, and 0.2 ± 0.3% not characterized. For the homozygotes, the corresponding numbers were 95.8 ± 3.4, 2.2 ± 2.0, 1.7 ± 1.9, and 0.3 ± 0.9%, respectively. No significant differences were found in any category. No alterations were detected by light microscopic analysis of testicular and epididymal structures (data not shown), indicating normal development of these male reproductive organs in knockout mice. However, a striking phenotype was observed when spermatozoa (mature sperm) from the cauda epididymidis were inspected for morphology and motility (Fig. 1 and Table I). A majority (>51%) of spermatozoa from apoer2–/– animals showed coiling of the tail with the degree of bending ranging from slight angulations (<90°, 8.0% of sperm) to hairpin structures (180°, 43.0% of sperm). In comparison, 98% of spermatozoa from control males showed straight tail morphology (Table I). In addition, some sperm mid-pieces displayed abnormal kinking and fraying of axonemal structures (not shown). Spermatozoa from apoER2-deficient mice also suffered from impaired motility; the percentage of motile sperm was reduced to half the control value. All computer-assisted sperm analysis parameters were significantly reduced in the receptor-deficient mice except the vigor of movement (curvilinear velocity) and the amplitude of lateral head displacement, indicating no difference in flagellation per se but a decrease in the effectiveness of forward progression (Table I). This defect can be attributed to the abnormal tail structure.Table IEffect of apoER2 deficiency on sperm morphology and motility (mean ± S.E.)apoer2+/-apoer2-/-Sperm morphologyStraight98.0 ± 0.649.0 ± 6.5aSignificantly different (p < 0.05).Hairpin1.57 ± 0.5743.0 ± 5.9aSignificantly different (p < 0.05).Angulated0.4 ± 0.28.0 ± 3.5aSignificantly different (p < 0.05).Sperm motility% Motile70.1 ± 4.438.3 ± 4.4aSignificantly different (p < 0.05).Curvilinear velocity, μm/s142.8 ± 3.5126.4 ± 9.0Average path velocity, μm/s108.9 ± 2878.8 ± 7.2aSignificantly different (p < 0.05).Straight line velocity, μm/s94.3 ± 2.767.2 ± 6.6aSignificantly different (p < 0.05).Amplitude of lateral head displacement, μm9.4 ± 0.318.63 ± 0.68Beat cross frequency, Hz21.2 ± 0.527.3 ± 1.1aSignificantly different (p < 0.05).Linearity, %66.6 ± 1.059.3 ± 2.2aSignificantly different (p < 0.05).a Significantly different (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab Male germ cells mature to fertilizing sperm as they move from the testis through the various segments of the epididymal duct. To test which step in sperm maturation may be defective in apoer2 knockout mice, we performed regional specific analyses of the spermatozoa and correlated our findings with the expression pattern of the receptor. The presence of apoER2 in epithelial cells of the epididymis had been reported before (3Stockinger W. Brandes C. Fasching D. Hermann M. Gotthardt M. Herz J. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25625-25632Google Scholar). However, no information on the specific epididymal region expressing the protein was available. Immunohistochemistry localized the receptor exclusively to the principal cells in the initial segment of the epididymis (Fig. 2). No significant apoER2 expression was detected in the adjacent caput, corpus, or cauda or in the testis (data not shown). Interestingly, the regional specific appearance of sperm tail abnormalities in apoER2-deficient males paralleled the distinct expression pattern of the receptor. Spermatozoa descending from the seminiferous tubules of the testis into the initial segment of the epididymis were normal and exhibited straight tail morphology (region 1, Fig. 3). After exit from the initial segment, distinct morphological abnormalities became apparent and progressively increased in percentage during transit of the sperm through the epididymal duct (regions 2–6). This observation suggested normal spermatogenesis in the testis but abnormal sperm maturation in the proximal epididymis of animals lacking apoER2.Fig. 3Regional sperm tail morphology in heterozygous (+/–) and apoER2-deficient mice (–/–). Sperm were isolated from consecutive epididymal segments of mice of the indicated genotypes and analyzed for straight (above) and hairpin tail morphology (middle) or for the presence of other abnormalities (e.g. defective mid-piece) (below). Values are given as percent of total sperm count. 1, initial segment; 2, caput; 3, proximal corpus; 4, mid-corpus; 5, distal corpus; 6, proximal cauda.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Acquisition of sperm motility in the epididymis requires extensive structural remodeling of the spermatozoa, and an inability to adopt these changes results in structural abnormalities and in immotility (19Jones R. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1998; 53: 73-84Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the hairpin morphology of sperm from apoer2–/– males could be reverted completely upon incubation in buffer containing mild detergents (such as 0.1% Triton X-100) (Fig. 4). This phenomenon has been observed in other models of epididymal dysfunction. It indicates a failure of the sperm to regulate the intracellular osmotic pressure, termed “cell volume decrease.” Sperm with defective cell volume decrease fail to counteract water influx when released into hypo-osmotic conditions, causing cell swelling and coiling of the tail. The swelling is relieved upon perforation of the sperm membrane with detergents, resulting in tail straightness (20Yeung C.H. Sonnenberg-Riethmacher E. Cooper T.G. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1062-1069Google Scholar, 21Butler A. He X. Gordon R.E. Wu H.S. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1061-1075Google Scholar). To uncover the molecular mechanism underlying this defect, we compared the protein expression pattern in sperm from apoer2–/– and apoer2+/– epididymis using two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. As exemplified in Fig. 5, a single protein spot with an apparent molecular mass of 19-kDa was significantly reduced in knockout compared with control sperm. By densitometric scanning, a 3-fold decrease in the amount of the protein was measured. Using mass spectrometry, four peptide sequences were derived from this protein spot corresponding to residues Thr76-Arg89, Ile97-Arg107, Gln108-Lys126, and Tyr180-Lys191 of murine phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx) (SwissProt data base entry O70325). PHGPx is a selenoperoxidase that plays a crucial role in spermatogenesis both in the testis and in the epididymis (22Godeas C. Tramer F. Micali F. Soranzo M. Sandri G. Panfili E. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1502-1508Google Scholar). The protein can change its physical properties and act either as a soluble enzyme or as an insoluble structural protein (23Roveri A. Ursini F. Flohe L. Maiorino M. Biofactors. 2001; 14: 213-222Google Scholar, 24Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Google Scholar). In immature spermatids in the testis, PHGPx functions as a peroxidase, controlling the oxidative milieu of the germ cell (25Roveri A. Casasco A. Maiorino M. Dalan P. Calligaro A. Ursini F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6142-6146Google Scholar). In the epididymis, PHGPx is catalytically inactive and covalently linked to thiol-proteins to form the sperm mitochondrial capsule (24Ursini F. Heim S. Kiess M. Maiorino M. Roveri A. Wissing J. Flohe L. Science. 1999; 285: 1393-1396Google Scholar). This capsule is a keratin-like matrix that surrounds the mitochondria wrapped in a helical arrangement around the flagellum in the sperm mid-piece. The capsule stabilizes the mitochondrial helix, and impaired PHGPx expression results in mid-piece irregularities and in mitochondria irregularly wrapped around the flagellum (26Imai H. Suzuki K. Ishizaka K. Ichinose S. Oshima H. Okayasu I. Emoto K. Umeda M. Nakagawa Y. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 674-683Google Scholar). As demonstrated by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5) and confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown), reduced expression of PHGPx was seen in epididymis- but not in testis-derived sperm of apoer2 knockout mice, indicating a defect in the structural rather than the catalytic function of the protein. Consistent with this hypothesis, a highly irregular mitochondrial helix was observed in mid-piece sections of most receptor-deficient spermatozoa (Fig. 6). Insufficient PHGPx expression was caused by translational or post-translational mechanisms, because transcriptional levels of the PHGPx gene were unchanged in knockout compared with control tissue (p = 0.16 and p = 0.60, Student's t test for epididymis and testis, respectively) (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of PHGPx expression in testis and epididymis. The expression levels of PHGPx in testis and epididymis of apoer2+/– (open bars) and apoer2–/– animals (closed bars) were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and indicated as relative expression intensities (mean ± S.E.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To this point, our studies had traced the likely reason for the male infertility in the apoer2–/– mice to an inability to sustain normal sperm levels of PHGPx expression in the epididymis-derived sperm. As a consequence, the spermatozoa suffer from severe structural defects of the mitochondria and from cell volume dysregulation. It is well established that the epithelial cells of the epididymis provide the proper microenvironment for structural remodeling of the spermatozoa and for acquisition of motility (27Aitken R.J. Vernet P. J. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. 1998; 53: 109-118Google Scholar, 28Christova Y. James P.S. Cooper T.G. Jones R. J. Androl. 2002; 23: 384-392Google Scholar, 29Turner T.T. Miller D.W. Avery E.A. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 52: 1012-1019Google Scholar, 30Cooper T.G. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1998; 53: 119-136Google Scholar). Through regulated secretion and reabsorption, they regulate the pH, osmotic pressure, and composition of epididymal fluids and control the transfer of metabolites such as proteins, lipids, and sugars to and from the sperm surface. Given the expression of apoER2 in principal cells of the epididymis, alterations in epididymal fluid composition were considered a possible cause for the sperm maturation defect in receptor-deficient mice. Therefore, we performed a detailed analysis of the hormone, electrolyte, and protein status of the epididymal fluids in knockout and in control tissues. Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels in the epididymis were identical in apoer2–/– (8.9 ± 5.9 and 8.1 ± 3.2 ng/g, respectively) and apoer2+/– animals (13.3 ± 19.5 and 14.7 ± 18.4 ng/g, respectively). Furthermore, no difference in the osmotic pressure of the epididymal fluids from knockout mice and heterozygous controls was detected (484.0 ± 24.2 and 479.9 ± 18.9 mmol/kg, respectively). In contrast, by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE the accumulation of a cluster of protein spots in the 40-kDa molecular mass range was observed in the epididymal fluid of receptor-deficient animals compared with controls (Fig. 8). By tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry, these spots were identified as the α-chain of murine clusterin (derived peptide sequences corresponding to residues Val385-Arg400, Leu408-Lys424, and Phe429-Lys436 of SwissProt data base entry Q06890). Clusterin is a heterodimeric glycoprotein involved in lipid transport and in sperm maturation (31Jones S.E. Jomary C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 427-431Google Scholar, 32Rosenberg M.E. Silkensen J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 633-645Google Scholar). The protein associates with the membrane of sperm in the testis. In the epididymis, it dissociates from the sperm surface to be cleared from the ductual fluids by the principal cells. To demonstrate that apoER2 may be involved in the removal of clusterin from the epididymal fluid, we tested binding of the protein to apoER2 by surface plasmon resonance analysis (BIAcore) (Fig. 9). In these studies, clusterin bound to apoER2 in a concentration-dependent manner. The interaction was blocked by the receptor-associated protein, an inhibitor of ligand binding to members of the LDL receptor gene family. Taken together, these data identified apoER2 as a novel clusterin receptor and suggested receptor deficiency as the cause of impaired catabolism and extracellular accumulation of the protein. Human infertility affects 5–7% of all male individuals. Approximately 60% of all cases of infertility are attributed to genetic factors, and the elucidation of the underlying gene defects is an area of intensive research (33De Kretser D.M. Baker H.W.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 3443-3450Google Scholar, 34Lilford R. Jones A.M. Bishop D.T. Thornton J. Mueller R. BMJ. 1994; 309: 570-573Google Scholar). The production of active male gametes is a complicated process that involves (i) elaboration of spermatozoa from early germ cells in the testis, (ii) development of motility and fertilizing potential in the epididymis, and (iii) the ability to undergo capacitation in the female tract. Gene defects blocking any of these steps result in impaired fertility. Consistent with the expression of apoER2 in the epididymis, this receptor plays a crucial role in the acquisition of sperm motility, and deletion of the corresponding gene in the mouse results in less motile sperm. Based on our findings we propose that apoER2 activity is required to sustain normal expression of sperm PHGPx in the epididymis. As a consequence of the receptor gene defect, expression of PHGPx is reduced, causing structural and, likely, functional defects of the sperm mitochondria, and cell volume dysregulation. Whether apoER2 directly regulates the metabolism of PHGPx or whether loss of the protein is an indirect consequence of the receptor defect still needs to be addressed. The crucial role of PHGPx in fertility has been appreciated in numerous studies (26Imai H. Suzuki K. Ishizaka K. Ichinose S. Oshima H. Okayasu I. Emoto K. Umeda M. Nakagawa Y. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 674-683Google Scholar, 35Foresta C. Flohe L. Garolla A. Roveri A. Ursini F. Maiorino M. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 967-971Google Scholar). Thus, PHGPx levels in human sperm are correlated positively with morphological integrity and forward motility (35Foresta C. Flohe L. Garolla A. Roveri A. Ursini F. Maiorino M. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 67: 967-971Google Scholar). When expression of the protein was assessed in spermatozoa from infertile men, more than 10% of the individuals suffered from a dramatic decrease of PHGPx expression. As a consequence, their sperm were immotile and exhibited irregularly sized mitochondria, a phenotype that closely resembles features of sperm in apoER2-deficient mice (26Imai H. Suzuki K. Ishizaka K. Ichinose S. Oshima H. Okayasu I. Emoto K. Umeda M. Nakagawa Y. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 674-683Google Scholar). Loss of the sperm tail, as frequently observed in sperm from selenium-deficient mice, has also been attributed to inadequate levels of PHGPx in the mitochondrial membrane (36Behne D. Weiler H. Kyriakopoulos A. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1996; 106: 291-297Google Scholar). The correlation between PHGPx expression, mitochondrial integrity, and sperm motility is far from being clearly understood. Lack of peroxidase activity in the sperm may result in the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and in oxidative damage to the mitochondria (26Imai H. Suzuki K. Ishizaka K. Ichinose S. Oshima H. Okayasu I. Emoto K. Umeda M. Nakagawa Y. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 674-683Google Scholar, 37Rao B. Soufir J.C. Martin M. David G. Gamete Res. 1989; 24: 127-134Google Scholar, 38Aitken R.J.

Reprod. 1998; 4: 111-118Google Scholar). Alternatively, absence of the protein may affect formation of the sperm mitochondrial capsule that is essential for forming the mitochondrial helix in the sperm mid-piece. Mitochondrial defects in turn cause immotility by yet unknown mechanisms (40Weinberg J.B. Doty E. Bonaventura J. Haney A.F. Fertil. Steril. 1995; 64: 408-413Google Scholar, 41Folgerø T. Bertheussen K. Lindal S. Torbergsen T. Øian P. Hum. Reprod. 1993; 8: 1863-1868Google Scholar). One simple explanation may be insufficient energy production to sustain forward motility and cell volume regulation. Several knockout mouse models of epididymal dysfunction and sperm immotility have been reported in the literature that may shed some light on a possible contribution of apoER2 to sperm maturation (42Venables J.P. Cooke H.J. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 2000; 23: 584-591Google Scholar, 43Cooke H.J. Saunders P.T. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 790-801Google Scholar). Spermatozoa of mice with deletion of the retinoid X receptor β gene present with hairpin tail morphology and with failure of the mitochondria to form a helix around the flagellum (44Kastner P. Mark M. Leid M. Gansmuller A. Chin W. Grondona J.M. Decimo D. Krezel W. Dierich A. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 80-92Google Scholar). Accumulation of lipids in Sertoli cells and in epididymal ducts is held responsible for the sperm maturation defect in this model. Similarly, heterozygosity for the apoB gene defect (45Huang L.S. Voyiaziakis E. Chen H.L. Rubin E.M. Gordon J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10903-10907Google Scholar) or homozygous deletion of the acid sphingomyelinase gene (21Butler A. He X. Gordon R.E. Wu H.S. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1061-1075Google Scholar) affects the lipid metabolism of the epididymis and the spermatozoa, resulting in sperm immotility. In particular, the latter model exhibits close resemblance to apoER2-deficient mice inasmuch as the sperm are characterized by detergent-reversible tail angulation (21Butler A. He X. Gordon R.E. Wu H.S. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 1061-1075Google Scholar). Unfortunately, no information is available on the expression of PHGPx protein in this mouse model. Besides defects in lipid metabolism, the absence of signaling pathways in the epididymis as in c-Ros-deficient mice also results in cell volume dysregulation and in detergent-reversible tail angulation. The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Ros is an orphan receptor expressed in the initial segment and in the caput epididymis (46Sonnenberg-Riethmacher E. Walter B. Riethmacher D. Godecke S. Birchmeier C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1184-1193Google Scholar). Lack of the initial segment of the epididymis in c-Ros-deficient mice coincides with cell volume dysregulation (20Yeung C.H. Sonnenberg-Riethmacher E. Cooper T.G. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1062-1069Google Scholar, 47Yeung C.H. Sonnenberg-Riethmacher E. Cooper T.G. J. Reprod. Fertil. Suppl. 1998; 53: 137-147Google Scholar, 48Yeung C.H. Wagenfeld A.

Reprod. 2002; 67: 269-275Google Scholar). Based on findings in the aforementioned models, a role for apoER2 in lipid metabolism or in signal transduction during sperm maturation may be considered. The function of apoER2 in cellular uptake of lipoproteins has been reported before (1Kim D.-H. Iijima H. Goto K. Sakai J. Ishii H. Kim H.-J. Suzuki H. Kondo H. Saeki S. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8373-8380Google Scholar). Although the endocytic activity of the receptor in cultured cells is low compared with other lipoprotein receptors (50Li Y. Lu W. Marzolo M.P. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 21: 18000-18006Google Scholar), the protein may be more active in lipoprotein uptake in the proper cellular environment of the epididymis, a phenomenon known for other members of the LDL receptor family. For example, the LDL receptor is dependent on the presence of a hepatocyte-specific adaptor to mediate LDL endocytosis in the liver but not in fibroblasts (51Garcia C.K. Wilund K. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Maioli M. Calandra S. Bertolini S. Cossu F. Grishin N. Barnes R. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2001; 292: 1394-1398Google Scholar, 52Wilund K.R. Yi M. Campagna F. Arca M. Zuliani G. Fellin R. Ho Y.K. Garcia J.V. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3019-3030Google Scholar). In analogy to its function in the brain, a role for apoER2 as signaling receptor in the epididymis is also possible. However, this function is unlikely to involve the signaling factor Reelin because reeler mice do not suffer from severe sperm tail abnormalities as seen in the apoer2 knockout animals. Some angulated tails were present in sperm samples from reelin–/– mice, but most sperm had normal tail morphology. 2O. M. Andersen, C.-H. Yeung, H. Vorum, M. Wellner, T. K. Andreassen, B. Erdmann, E.-C. Mueller, J. Herz, A. Otto, T. G. Cooper, and T. E. Willnow, unpublished information. As a first step toward identification of possible ligands that bind to apoER2 in the epididymis, we analyzed the luminal fluid for proteins accumulating in knockout samples. This approach was based on the observation that the epididymal luminal fluid contains factors that bind to the receptor in BIAcore analysis (data not shown). Using this approach we identified clusterin as an endogenous ligand for apoER2. Interestingly, this protein has also been uncovered by Schneider and coworkers as an apoER2-binding protein in independent studies. 3W. Schneider, personal communication. Although clusterin plays a role in sperm maturation, it is unlikely that loss of clusterin-mediated apoER2 function is responsible for the phenotype of the apoer2–/– mice because deletion of the clusterin gene has a rather modest effect on male fertility (53Bailey R.W. Aronow B. Harmony J.A. Griswold M.D. Biol. Reprod. 2002; 66: 1042-1053Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this finding is noteworthy because megalin, another member of the LDL receptor gene family expressed in principal cells of the epididymis, was identified earlier as an endocytic receptor for clusterin (54Morales C.R. Igdoura S.A. Wosu U.A. Boman J. Argraves W.S. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 676-683Google Scholar, 55Hermo L. Lustig M. Lefrancois S. Argraves W.S. Morales C.R. Mol. Reprod.

Thus, our results demonstrate that two related receptors, apoER2 and megalin, should both be considered when studying the catabolism of clusterin in the epididymis. In summary, we have uncovered the pathophysiological basis of male infertility in apoER2-deficient mice, namely abnormal sperm morphology and subnormal motility. These findings highlight an important and previously unrecognized role of the receptor in sperm development. Further studies into the molecular pathways may yield significant new insights into the concept of sperm maturation and the cause of infertility in humans. We are indebted to H. Schulz, C. Räder, M.

Brown algae from the order Laminariales (kelps) are characterized by a heteromorphic haplodiplophasic life cycle alternating between a microscopic filamentous gametophyte and a macroscopic sporophyte, which can reach several meters in length depending of the species. Kelps' sporophytes accumulate iodine to more than 30,000 times the concentration of this element in seawater, up to levels as high as 1% of dry weight (e.g. see Refs. 2Saenko G.N. Kravtsova Y.Y.

Jennings G.S. Hoffmann T. Nature. 2002; 417: 632-636Google Scholar). In the biology of marine algae, volatile halocarbons are viewed as defense metabolites, i.e. products of the scavenging of activated oxygen species and/or potent biocides (6Wever R. Tromp M.G.M.

Schweigert N. Ar Gall E. Legendre J.-M. Vilter H. Kloareg B. Planta. 1998; 207: 163-171Google Scholar) and the production of halo-organic compounds (6Wever R. Tromp M.G.M. Krenn B.E. Marjani A.

Biol. 1998; 2: 279-285Google Scholar) by marine algae are thought to involve vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases. Haloperoxidases catalyze the oxidation of halides, and they are named according to the most electronegative halide that they can oxidize; chloroperoxidases can catalyze the oxidation of chloride, as well as of bromide and iodide, bromoperoxidases (BPOs) 1The abbreviations used are: BPO, bromoperoxidase; vBPO, vanadium-dependent bromoperoxidase; IPO, iodoperoxidase; MS, mass spectrometry; MS/MS, tandem MS; LC, liquid chromatography; EST, expressed sequence tag; UTR, untranslated region. react with bromide and iodide, whereas iodoperoxidases (IPOs) are specific of iodide. The ability of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases to halogenate a broad range of organic compounds of both commercial and pharmaceutical interest, as well as their high stability toward high temperatures, oxidative conditions, and in the presence of organic solvents, makes them good candidates for use in industrial biotransformations (12Vilter H. Sigel H. Sigel A. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. 31. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 325-362Google Scholar, 13Butler A. Carter J.N. Simpson M.T. Bertini I. Sigel A. Sigel H. Handbook on Metallo-proteins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2001: 153-179Google Scholar). These properties have elicited detailed structural and mechanistic studies on several vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases, namely the chloroperoxidase from the fungus Curvularia inaequalis (14Messerschmidt A. Wever R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 392-396Google Scholar) and the bromoperoxidases from the red algae Corallina pilulifera (15Shimonishi M. Kuwamoto S. Inoue H. Wever R. Ohshiro T.

Various vanadium-dependent haloperoxidase isoforms have been described in Laminariales (21de Boer E. Tromp M.G.M. Plat H. Kreen B.E. Wever R. Biochim. Biophys.

Phytochemistry. 2001; 57: 633-642Google Scholar), but nothing is known on the structure of these haloperoxidases. To further understand the biochemical and biological functions of haloperoxidases in Laminariales, we now have undertaken the purification and molecular characterization of these enzymes. We show here that Laminaria digitata sporophytes feature distinct iodoperoxidase and bromoperoxidase activities and that the bromoperoxidases consist of near-identical proteins on the form of multimeric aggregates. From partial cDNAs displaying homologies with the F. distichus vBPO, which were identified in an Expressed Sequence Tag analysis of the life cycle of L. digitata (1Crépineau F. Roscoe T. Kaas R. Kloareg B. Boyen C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 503-513Google Scholar), we have isolated two full-length haloperoxidase cDNAs from the sporophyte of this species. Sequence comparisons, mass spectrometry, and immunological analyses of the purified bromoperoxidase, as well as the activity of the protein expressed in Escherichia coli, all indicate that these almost identical cDNAs encode bromoperoxidases. In addition peptide sequencing and Western blotting show that the primary structure of iodoperoxidase markedly departs from that of bromoperoxidase. Plant Material—L. digitata young sporophytes (blade length less than 25 cm) were collected from the shore in the vicinity of Roscoff (Brittany, France) and maintained under a 12:12 light-dark cycle in running seawater at 15 °C or immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at –80 °C. Gametophyte cultures were established and maintained as described previously (29Ar Gall E. Asensi A. Marie D. Kloareg B. Eur. J. Phycol. 1996; 31: 369-380Google Scholar). Purification of Vanadium-dependent Haloperoxidases—As the algae from the Laminariaceae family are extremely rich in alginates and polyphenolic compounds, an aqueous salt/polymer two-phase system developed by Vilter (30Vilter H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 665-672Google Scholar) was used for the extraction of haloperoxidases. Briefly, 120 g of L. digitata sporophytes were powdered in liquid nitrogen and extracted using 20% (w/v) K2CO3 (100 ml per aliquots of 20-g fresh weight) and 13% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (1550 Da). The two phases were separated by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min, and 6% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 and 3 volumes of acetone were added to the top phase. After 1 h at –20 °C, the protein extract was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, buffer, and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The extract was then loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose CL4B hydrophobic interaction column, equilibrated with 30% (NH4)2SO4, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Proteins were eluted by a decreasing linear gradient down to salt-free Tris buffer. The haloperoxidase active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and concentrated by filtration (YM-10; Millipore) on stirred ultracentrifugation cells (model 8200; Millipore). For the final purification of native enzymes, semi-preparative electrophoresis (model 491 Prep Cell; Bio-Rad) or electroelution (model 422 Electro-eluter; Bio-Rad) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Proteins of L. digitata gametophytes were extracted in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol buffer, containing 0.5% polyvinylpolypyrolidone and 0.5% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich). After sonication (three times, 30 s), the pellet was discarded by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein extract was recovered from the supernatant. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Coomassie protein assay (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard (Sigma-Aldrich), and the holoenzymes were re-constituted by adding 2 mm NaVO3. Gel electrophoresis was carried out using 9% polyacrylamide slab gels according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and using protein molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad). SDS samples were denatured by boiling at 100 °C for 10 min. Enzyme Activity Assays—Haloperoxidase activities were detected on non-denaturing gels, soaked with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, in the presence of 0.1 mmo-dianisidine, 0.45 mm H2O2, and 10 mm potassium iodide, potassium bromide, or potassium chloride for revealing iodoperoxidase, bromoperoxidase, or chloroperoxidase activities, respectively. To detect haloperoxidase activity on denaturating gels, SDS was removed by washing the gel in Tris-glycine buffer containing 0.1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich). Bromoperoxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring at 290 nm the conversion of monochlorodimedone (20.0/cm/mm) into monochlorobromodimedone (0.2/cm/mm) at pH 6.1 (33Hager L.P. Morris D.R. Brown F.S. Eberwein H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1769-1777Google Scholar). Specific activities are expressed in units per milligram of protein, where one unit of bromoperoxidase activity is defined as the amount required for brominating 1 μmol of monochlorodimedone per min. Iodoperoxidase activity was recorded at pH 6.2 following the conversion of iodide into triiodide (26.4/cm/mm) at 350 nm (34Vilter H. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 1387-1390Google Scholar). The differences between the non-enzymatic and the non-enzymatic-plus-enzyme reactions were calculated for each sample. The specific activity is expressed in units per milligram of protein, where one unit of iodoperoxidase activity is defined as the amount required for consuming 1 μmol of H2O2 per min. For optimal pH determination, iodoperoxidase specific activities were measured in the same conditions at 20 °C, using the following buffers: 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0–5.5, or 0.1 m MES, pH 5.5–6.8. For thermostability studies, proteins were maintained at the appropriate temperature for 10 min before the iodoperoxidase assay. Molecular Weight Determination of the Native Enzymes—Using nondenaturating gel electrophoresis, protein samples were run under a range of acrylamide concentrations from 4 to 14% (35Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Google Scholar). A molecular size standard curve was established using standard proteins (albumin, aldolase, catalase, ferritin, and urease from Amersham Biosciences), which were electrophoresed under the same conditions. The relative molecular mass of native proteins was also determined by fast protein liquid chromatography/gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column; Amersham Biosciences) with a mobile phase consisting of 100 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Standard proteins (Amersham Biosciences) were used for column calibration. Mass Spectrometry Analyses—Phenyl-sepharose haloperoxidase fractions were separated by fast protein liquid chromatography/gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200 HR) followed by a 9% SDS-PAGE. The in-gel digestion by trypsin was performed on excised activity bands as described by Rabilloud et al. (36Rabilloud T. Strub J.-M. Luche S. Van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 699-704Google Scholar). Nanoscale capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (nano-LC-MS/MS) analyses of the digested proteins were performed using a CapLC capillary LC system (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) coupled to an hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Q-TOF II; Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). Chromatographic separations were conducted on a reversed-phase capillary column (Pepmap C18; 75-μm internal diameter, 15-cm length; LC Packings) with a 200 nl/min flow. LC analyses were performed using a linear gradient from 95% A (H2O/0.05% HCOOH) to 45% B (acetonitrile/0.05% HCOOH) in 35 min, followed by a linear gradient to 95% B in 1 min, and finally followed by an isocratic step at 95% B during 4 min. Mass data acquisitions were performed using automatic switching between the MS and MS/MS modes. Fragmentation of precursor was performed using collision with argon gas. The collision energy was selected automatically for each precursor ion depending on precursor ion mass (between 20 and 100 eV). The m/z scale was calibrated by using the synthetic polyalanine ions. Micro-LC-MS/MS experiments were performed using an ion trap mass spectrometer Esquire 3000+ operating with an electrospray source in positive mode (Bruker-Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany) coupled to an Agilent 1100 Series capillary LC system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) as described (37.Sauber, C., Mandel, F., Van Dorsselaer, A., Schaeffer, C., and Wagner, E. (2002) Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, www.chem.agilent.com/scripts/LiteraturePDF.asp?iWHID-27796,Google Scholar). The samples were loaded onto a 0.3 × 35-mm ZORBAX SB-C18 enrichment column at a flow rate of 50 μl/min with H2O/0.1% HCOOH for 5 min. The trapped tryptic peptides were back-flushed onto the analytical column (0.3 × 150-mm; ZORBAX 300 SB-C18) at a flow rate of 4 μl/min using a linear gradient from 95% A (H2O/0.1% HCOOH) to 60% B (acetonitrile/0.1% HCOOH) in 60 min followed by a linear gradient to 80% B in 5 min and finally followed by an isocratic step at 80% B for 5 min. For MS experiments (in auto-MS/MS mode) the two most important ions of each MS spectrum were fragmented by applying a resonance frequency on the end-cap electrodes (peak-to-peak amplitude from 0.3 to 2.0 V) matching the frequency of the selected ions. Fragmentation of the precursor ions occurred in the ion trap because of collisions with Helium buffer gas (pressure 5.10–3 millibar). Calibration of the ion trap analyzer was performed by using multiply charged ions mixture made with the following peptides: Arg-Leu-enkephalin, angiotensin, Substance P, bombesin, and ACTH. Mass data collected during the nano- and micro-LC-MS/MS analyses were processed and converted into peak list and MGF (Mascot Generic File) files, respectively, and then submitted to the search software MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, United Kingdom), with a tolerance on mass measurement of 0.5 Da. The peptide sequences were obtained by mass spectrometry de novo sequencing. Data from the nano-LC-MS/MS analysis (Q-TOF II) were deconvoluted with the algorithm Maxent3 (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). cDNA Isolation, Cloning, and Sequencing—The longest of the vBPO EST, LamdiSest169est (NCBI accession number AW400475), identified previously in L. digitata sporophytes (1Crépineau F. Roscoe T. Kaas R. Kloareg B. Boyen C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 503-513Google Scholar), was subcloned in SacI pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid DNA was sequenced on both strands using the Vistra Thermosequenase core sequencing kit on a Vistra automated DNA sequencer (Amersham Biosciences). The L. digitata sporophyte cDNA λZAP II library (1Crépineau F. Roscoe T. Kaas R. Kloareg B. Boyen C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 503-513Google Scholar) was used as a template in polymerase chain reaction to amplify the 5′end of the BPO cDNA using pBluescript universal primer (forward) and a 5′end-specific primer from the LamdiSest169est (reverse; 5′-CTGCAGGTTCTCTGCGGCGA-3′). The 1000-bp PCR fragment obtained was cloned in the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) to screen the L. digitata sporophyte cDNA library. Positive cDNA clones were subcloned by PCR using insert-specific oligonucleotides in the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and were sequenced on both strands. Sequence and Structural Analyses—Primary sequence analysis and translation were carried out using the DNAMAN program version 4.15. Prediction of protein sorting signal and of signal peptide cleavage site were performed using the TargetP, SignalP, and PSORT programs, respectively; in silico tryptic digestion of protein sequences was performed using the PeptideCutter program (programs available on the www.expasy.org server and the www.cbs.dtu.dk/services site). The vBPO protein sequences were aligned using DNAMAN and displayed using GENEDOC (free access on www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc). The protein structure from L. digitata vBPO was predicted using the SWISS-MODEL program based on the three-dimensional structure of A. nodosum vBPO (NCBI accession number 1QI9A). The three-dimensional representations were visualized by the Swiss-PdbViewer software (free access on www.expasy.org server). Southern Analyses—Genomic DNA was isolated from frozen L. digitata sporophytes as described by Apt et al. (38Apt K.E. Clendennen S.K. Powers D.A. Grossman A.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 455-464Google Scholar). Digested DNA (5 μg/lane) was electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel and blotted onto nylon filters. The vBPO intragenic probe was prepared from an 800-bp EcoRI-SacI fragment of LamdiSest169est (corresponding to Leu-182-Leu-412 in vBPO1; see Fig. 5). Southern blot hybridization, probe labeling, and detection were performed using the Gene Images random prime labeling module kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting—Denaturated proteins were resolved on a 9% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting and ECL detection were performed using the ECL Western blotting System (Amersham Biosciences). The polyclonal antibodies against the vBPO isoenzyme-I from A. nodosum were kindly supplied by H. Vilter (34Vilter H. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 1387-1390Google Scholar) and used at a 1:2,500 dilution. A polyclonal antipeptide to vBPO of L. digitata was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide (see Fig. 5) by Eurogentec and used at 1:1,700 dilution. Expression of L. digitata vBPO in E. coli—An 1836-bp fragment from the putative mature protein v-BPO1 was amplified using the primers 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAGCAGGCTTCTACGAGGAGCCTCCCTCCCGAGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCTAGAGCTCGGTGTGTCCGTGGAG-3′ (reverse; AttP1 and AttP2 recombination sites of the Gateway system are underlined; Invitrogen). The PCR product was inserted into the pDEST17 expression vector and amplified in DH5α E. coli strain for DNA replication and sequence verifications and in E. coli BL21-SI (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) for expression studies. A 2-ml overnight preculture of the transformed bacteria was used to inoculate a 250-ml culture of LBON medium (LB medium without salts) containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin. Recombinant bacteria were grown at 37 °C until 0.5 A600 and then with 150 mm NaCl for 16 h at 30 °C in the presence or in the absence of 3% ethanol (39Thomas J.G. Baneyx F. Prot. Exp. Purif. 1997; 11: 289-296Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, here-after referred to as the cytoplasmic fraction, were extracted from the bacterial pellet by solubilization in B-PER detergent (Pierce), and the extract was supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (anti-protease protection) and 2 mm NaVO3. Aggregated proteins from inclusion bodies were solubilized by 6 m urea in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Purification of Haloperoxidases from L. digitata Sporophytes—Haloperoxidases from L. digitata were extracted using an aqueous salt/polymer two-phase system (30Vilter H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 228: 665-672Google Scholar) and analyzed by non-denaturing electrophoresis followed by an in-gel activity assay (Fig. 1). Haloperoxidase activities were apparent only after adding orthovanadate to the protein extract, indicating that these enzymes are vanadium-dependent. Whereas no chloroperoxidase activity was detected, at least six major bands (referred to as BPOa–f) with bromoperoxidase activity were revealed in the presence of either bromide or iodide. A single enzyme activity specific for the oxidation of iodide (referred to as IPO) was apparent (Fig. 1). Haloperoxidases were further fractionated by hydrophobic interactions on a phenyl-Sepharose CL4B column. The IPO activity was then purified to homogeneity by semi-preparative electrophoresis (Fig. 2A). The bands with BPO activity were excised from the non-denaturing electrophoresis gel and electroeluted separately. When re-analyzed by native gel electrophoresis, however, every band again showed a same, complex pattern (Fig. 2B). Under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE), IPO ran as a single protein with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa and as a protein of ∼80 kDa in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). Upon SDS-PAGE analysis, all of the BPOs were also resolved as one single band, each with relative molecular mass of 145 kDa. In the presence of β-mercaptoethanol they again appeared as a single band, yet with a molecular mass of ∼70 kDa (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). Biochemical Properties of Haloperoxidases from L. digitata— The specific activities of L. digitata haloperoxidases are summarized in Table I. In contrast to the sporophytes, a weak bromoperoxidase activity and no iodoperoxidase activity was detected in the crude protein extracts from the gametophytes of L. digitata. The IPO purified from the sporophytes displayed a specific activity of 310 units/mg toward iodide at pH 6.2. The purified BPO fraction had a lower efficiency toward iodide, in the iodoperoxidase assay. The purified haloperoxidases displayed the same pH optimum, at around 5.5 (Fig. 3). At this pH, iodoperoxidase-specific activities were 1200 units/mg for IPO and 180 units/mg for BPOs. Upon heating for 10 min, the purified IPO and BPOs remained fully active up to 60 °C (Fig. 3), with the high molecular mass BPOs retaining the highest activity up to 80 °C (data not shown).Table IBromoperoxidase and iodoperoxidase activities from L. digitataSampleSpecific activityBromoperoxidaseIodoperoxidaseunits/mgGametophyte crude extract0.70.Sporophyte extract2.610.4Pure sporophyte BPO42.62.Pure sporophyte IPO0.310. Open table in a new tab Mass Spectrometry Analyses of Excised BPOs and IPO— Mass spectrometry analyses were carried out for three of the bromoperoxidase bands, BPOb–d, and for the iodoperoxidase. As the N-terminal sequences of these proteins were blocked, they were digested by trypsin and analyzed by nano- or micro-LC-MS/MS. Very similar MS data were obtained for the three BPOs, and among those data, an identical set of eleven peptides was identified in BPOb–d tryptic digests (Table II). As illustrated in Fig. 4, four peptides were fully sequenced, resulting in identical sequences for all of the three BPO bands. None of the eleven peptide masses observed in BPO tryptic digests was found in the IPO tryptic digest, which markedly differed from the BPOs by its mass spectra (Table II) and by the partial sequences obtained by de novo sequencing (AVNVA, SAPG(I/L)NG, (I/L)VAADTVNTEAYR).Table IILC-MS-MS analyses of purified IPO and BPO tryptic digests and comparison with the theoretical tryptic digest of vBPO1 from L. digitataIPO, MH+ (obs.)BPOb-d, MH+ (obs.)vBPO1MH+ (calc.)Tryptic peptide residuesΔMDaDaDappm1197.781856.961856.84110-124651423.783326.803326.65137-16845983.581371.861371.76198-210731453.821350.601350.62287-29715875.541142.801142.55312-3202191646.881338.821338.76396-407451524.841083.801083.55463-472231946.581563.801563.71473-486571151.621464.801464.76508-52027942.64942.57521-529741350.801350.74555-56644 Open table in a new tab Molecular and Immunological Characterization of L. digitata Bromoperoxidases—In an EST analysis of the life cycle stages of L. digitata, one contig from 12 EST reconstructed a partial cDNA showing high homology with the vBPO of F. distichus (1Crépineau F. Roscoe T. Kaas R. Kloareg B. Boyen C. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 43: 503-513Google Scholar). The cDNA library from L. digitata sporophytes was thus screened for full-length vBPO cDNAs using a PCR-amplified probe designed from the 5′end of the partial cDNA, yielding several positive clones, which were mapped by restriction analyses. The two longest inserts, referred to as vBPO1 (3379 bp) and vBPO2 (3420 bp), were fully sequenced. They encoded two distinct full-length cDNA, with short 5′UTRs (104 and 36 bp, respectively) and with large 3′UTRs (1337 and 1338 bp, respectively). The two cDNAs had 99.2 and 99.5% identity at the nucleotide and protein levels, respectively. They mainly differed in their 5′ends, vBPO1 presenting a putative 20-amino acid signal peptide with the cleavage site after Gly-20 whereas vBPO2 harbored a longer one (56 amino acids), with the cleavage site located at Gly-56. The putative mature proteins had molecular masses of 68,953 Da (vBPO1) and 68,957 Da (vBPO2), differing by only three amino acids, Ile-75/Val-111, Gly-205/Ser-241, Val-365/Ser-401 (Fig. 5). The vBPO protein sequences from L. digitata presented 38 and 40% identity with those from F. distichus and A. nodosum, respectively (Fig. 5). In particular, L. digitata vBPOs differed from the other brown algal bromoperoxidases by longer C-terminal ends, including 17-amino acid-long insertions, between Gly-494 and Gly-511 (numbering of vBPO1). They featured, however, the two catalytic histidine residues, as well as all of the residues known to be involved in the fixation of vanadium (20Weyand M. Hecht H.-J. Kiess M. Liaud M.-F. Vilter H.

https://openalex.org/W1994311739,"T lymphocytes recognize peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells. Recognition specificity is determined by the αβ T cell receptor (TCR). The T lymphocyte surface glycoproteins CD8 and CD4 enhance T cell antigen recognition by binding to MHC class I and class II molecules, respectively. Biophysical measurements have determined that equilibrium binding of the TCR with natural agonist peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes occurs with KD values of 1–50 μm. The pMHCI/CD8 and pMHCII/CD4 interactions are significantly weaker than this (KD >100 μm), and the relative roles of TCR/pMHC and pMHC/coreceptor affinity in T cell activation remain controversial. Here, we engineer mutations in the MHCI heavy chain and β2-microglobulin that further reduce or abolish the pMHCI/CD8 interaction to probe the significance of pMHC/coreceptor affinity in T cell activation. We demonstrate that the pMHCI/CD8 coreceptor interaction retains the vast majority of its biological activity at affinities that are reduced by over 15-fold (KD > 2 mm). In contrast to previous reports, we observe that the weak interaction between HLA A68 and CD8, which falls within this spectrum of reduced affinities, retains substantial functional activity. These findings are discussed in the context of current concepts of coreceptor dependence and the mechanism by which TCR coreceptors facilitate T cell activation.

T lymphocytes recognize protein antigens in the form of short peptides presented in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TCR, T cell receptor; pMHC, peptide-major histocompatibility complex; β2m, β2-microglobulin; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocytes; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline: FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; IFN, interferon; MIP-1β, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β. 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TCR, T cell receptor; pMHC, peptide-major histocompatibility complex; β2m, β2-microglobulin; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocytes; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline: FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; IFN, interferon; MIP-1β, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β. molecules on the surface of target cells. Antigen specificity is conferred by the T cell receptor (TCR), whose highly variable complementarity determining regions interact with the peptide-binding platform of the MHC molecule (1Davis M.M. Boniface J.J. Reich Z. Lyons D. Hampl J. Arden B. Chien Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 523-544Google Scholar, 2Rudolph M.G. Wilson I.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 52-65Google Scholar). The peptide-MHC complex (pMHC) also interacts with the T cell surface glycoproteins CD8 and CD4, which bind to invariable regions of the MHC class I and II molecules, respectively (3Konig R. Huang L.Y. Germain R.N. Nature. 1992; 356: 796-798Google Scholar, 4Cammarota G. Scheirle A. Takacs B. Doran D.M. Knorr R. Bannwarth W. Guardiola J. Sinigaglia F.

Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 408-413Google Scholar). The binding sites for CD8 and CD4 are separate from the TCR-recognized (2Rudolph M.G. Wilson I.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 52-65Google Scholar), peptide-binding domains of MHC molecules, and allow a single MHC molecule to be bound simultaneously by both TCR and either CD8 or CD4 (5Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Google Scholar, 6Wang J.H. Meijers R. Xiong Y. Liu J.H. Sakihama T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10799-10804Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domains of CD8 and CD4 are known to interact with the T cell-specific intracellular protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck (8Veillette A. Bookman M.A. Horak E.M. Bolen J.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 301-308Google Scholar, 9Rudd C.E. Trevillyan J.M. Dasgupta J.D. Wong L.L. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5190-5194Google Scholar). This kinase is critical for the initiation of the TCR-mediated signal transduction cascade (10Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Google Scholar). The recruitment of essential signaling components to the cytoplasmic side of the TCR by simultaneous binding of either CD8 or CD4 to the same pMHC enhances TCR-mediated signal transduction (11Owens T. Fazekas de St Groth B. Miller J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9209-9213Google Scholar, 12Purbhoo M.A. Boulter J.M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A.L. Hourigan C.S. Dunbar P.R. Olson K.

Med. 1999; 190: 1517-1526Google Scholar). Thus, CD8 and CD4 act as coreceptors for antigen in concert with the antigen-specific TCR during the process of T cell recognition and activation. Whereas CD8 and CD4 appear to have similar biological roles, they have little structural similarity (14Zamoyska R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 82-87Google Scholar, 15Konig R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 75-83Google Scholar). CD8 is present on the lymphocyte cell surface as either a disulfide-bonded αα homodimeric or αβ heterodimeric molecule. CD8αβ predominates on cells expressing pMHCI-specific αβ TCRs (16Zamoyska R. Immunity. 1994; 1: 243-246Google Scholar). The CD8α chain recruits signaling components to the cytoplasmic side of the TCR/pMHC interaction (17Janeway Jr., C.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 645-674Google Scholar, 18Chalupny N.J. Ledbetter J.A. Kavathas P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1201-1207Google Scholar) and provides the majority of the binding energy in the CD8αβ heterodimer (19Devine L. Sun J. Barr M.R. Kavathas P.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 846-851Google Scholar). The globular head domains of murine CD8αα and CD8αβ bind to pMHCI with similar affinity (20Kern P. Hussey R.E. Spoerl R. Reinherz E.L. Chang H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27237-27243Google Scholar). Cell-cell adhesion assays have shown that human CD8αα and CD8αβ mediate adherence to pMHCI equally (21Sun J. Kavathas P.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6077-6082Google Scholar). Despite similar affinities for pMHCI, αβ heterodimer is more efficient than αα homodimer in promoting the response to antigen (22Renard V. Romero P. Vivier E. Malissen B. Luescher I.F. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2439-2444Google Scholar). This suggests a distinct function for CD8β. Recent evidence throws light on this role. First, it has been shown that CD8β is palmitoylated at a membrane-proximal cysteine (23Arcaro A. Gregoire C. Boucheron N. Stotz S. Palmer E. Malissen B. Luescher I.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2068-2076Google Scholar). This palmitoylation mediates the partitioning of CD8 in ordered, cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched, membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts or detergent-insoluble membranes (23Arcaro A. Gregoire C. Boucheron N. Stotz S. Palmer E. Malissen B. Luescher I.F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2068-2076Google Scholar). The short CD8β cytoplasmic domain also enables constitutive association with the TCR/CD3 complex and recruits this antigen recognition complex to lipid rafts (24Arcaro A. Gregoire C. Bakker T.R. Baldi L. Jordan M. Goffin L. Boucheron N. Wurm F. van der Merwe P.A. Malissen B. Luescher I.F. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1485-1495Google Scholar). Rafts exclude inhibitory phosphatases, such as CD45, and have been shown to be privileged sites for the induction of the TCR-associated signal transduction cascade (25Doucey M.A. Legler D.F. Boucheron N. Cerottini J.C. Bron C. Luescher I.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1561-1570Google Scholar, 26Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.A. Chauvin J.P. Pierres M. He H.T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Google Scholar, 27Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Google Scholar, 28Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Google Scholar, 29Xavier R. Seed B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 265-269Google Scholar). CD8β-mediated recruitment of the TCR to lipid rafts might therefore explain the greater efficiency of CD8αβ in promoting the response to antigen. Second, it has been shown that the pMHCI/CD8 interaction is not fixed but can be developmentally regulated by glycosylation (30Daniels M.A. Devine L. Miller J.D. Moser J.M. Lukacher A.E. Altman J.D. Kavathas P. Hogquist K.A. Jameson S.C. Immunity. 2001; 15: 1051-1061Google Scholar). Glycans on the CD8β stalk appear to modulate the ability of the distal binding surface of the dimeric CD8 globular head domains to bind pMHCI (31Moody A.M. Chui D. Reche P.A. Priatel J.J. Marth J.D. Reinherz E.L. Cell. 2001; 107: 501-512Google Scholar). This differential glycosylation, leading to altered pMHCI binding, highlights a further potential role of CD8β. In contrast to CD8, CD4 is a single polypeptide. The cytoplasmic domain of CD4, like that of CD8α, is known to interact with p56lck (9Rudd C.E. Trevillyan J.M. Dasgupta J.D. Wong L.L. Schlossman S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5190-5194Google Scholar). Further work is required to determine whether the single polypeptide of CD4 also incorporates the roles recently ascribed to the CD8β chain. The TCR and CD8 or CD4 coreceptors bind peptide-MHC independently and with distinct kinetics (32Wyer J.R. Willcox B.E. Gao G.F. Gerth U.C. Davis S.J. Bell J.I. van der Merwe P.A. Jakobsen B.K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 219-225Google Scholar, 33Xiong Y. Kern P. Chang H. Reinherz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5659-5667Google Scholar). The affinity of pMHC/coreceptor interactions are at the low extreme of those described for cell-cell interaction molecules (7Gao G.F. Rao Z. Bell J.I. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 408-413Google Scholar, 32Wyer J.R. Willcox B.E. Gao G.F. Gerth U.C. Davis S.J. Bell J.I. van der Merwe P.A. Jakobsen B.K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 219-225Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding of human CD8αα has been measured with several different HLA A, B, and C gene products and occurs at KD values of greater than 100 μm (34Gao G.F. Willcox B.E. Wyer J.R. Boulter J.M. O'Callaghan C.A. Maenaka K. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Van Der Merwe P.A. Bell J.I. Jakobsen B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15232-15238Google Scholar). The pMHCII/CD4 interaction is similarly weak (KD = 200 μm) (33Xiong Y. Kern P. Chang H. Reinherz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5659-5667Google Scholar). Here we examine the role of CD8 in antigen recognition using mutational changes in the α3 domain of MHCI and the β2-microglobulin subunit. These studies have enabled us to assess the contribution of the binding energy provided by the extracellular pMHCI/CD8 interaction to the activation of human anti-viral cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Inclusion Body Preparation—Biotin-tagged HLA-A2 and HLA-A68 2HLA A2 and HLA A68 are used to define HLA A*0201 and HLA*6801 throughout this article. heavy chains were expressed under the control of a T7 promoter as insoluble inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced E. coli were lysed by repeated freeze/thaw cycles to release inclusion bodies that were subsequently purified by washing with a 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer (Sigma) as described previously (35O'Callaghan C.A. Byford M.F. Wyer J.R. Willcox B.E. Jakobsen B.K. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 9-15Google Scholar). The D227K/T228A mutation in the α3 domain of HLA A2 has been shown to abrogate CD8 binding (12Purbhoo M.A. Boulter J.M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A.L. Hourigan C.S. Dunbar P.R. Olson K. Dawson S.J. Phillips R.E. Jakobsen B.K. Bell J.I. Sewell A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32786-32792Google Scholar); the corresponding A245V mutation reduces CD8 binding 5-fold (34Gao G.F. Willcox B.E. Wyer J.R. Boulter J.M. O'Callaghan C.A. Maenaka K. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Van Der Merwe P.A. Bell J.I. Jakobsen B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15232-15238Google Scholar). D227K/T228A and residue 245 mutants of HLA A2 and HLA A68 heavy chains, together with β2-microglobulin (β2m) and K58Eβ2m (36Glick M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A.L. Andersen T.B. Hutchinson S.L. Laugel B. Sewell A.K. Boulter J.M. Dunbar P.R. Cerundolo V. Oxenius A. Bell J.I. Richards W.G. Jakobsen B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20840-20846Google Scholar), were produced using the same expression system. Production of Soluble Peptide-MHC Class I—Soluble biotinylated MHC class I monomers were produced as described previously (36Glick M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A.L. Andersen T.B. Hutchinson S.L. Laugel B. Sewell A.K. Boulter J.M. Dunbar P.R. Cerundolo V. Oxenius A. Bell J.I. Richards W.G. Jakobsen B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20840-20846Google Scholar). Briefly, either HLA A2 or HLA A68 heavy chain and β2m inclusion body preparations were denatured separately in 8 m urea buffer (Sigma) and mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio. pMHCI was refolded in 2-mercaptoethylamine/cystamine (Sigma) redox buffer with added synthetic peptide (Reseach Genetics Invitrogen Corp., Huntsville, AL). HLA A2 heavy chains were refolded with the HIV p17 Gag epitope SLYNTVATL (residues 77–85) or the influenza matrix protein GILGFVFTL (residues 58–66). HLA A68 heavy chain was refolded with the HIV-1 Tat epitope ITKGLGISYGR (37Oxenius A. Jakobsen B.K. Easterbrook P.J. Boulter J.M. Tun T. Waters A. Agudelo J. Barnardo M. Phillips R.E. Price D.A. Aids. 2002; 16: 1285-1287Google Scholar). Following buffer exchange into 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, refolded monomer was purified by anion exchange. Purified monomers were biotinylated as previously described (35O'Callaghan C.A. Byford M.F. Wyer J.R. Willcox B.E. Jakobsen B.K. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 266: 9-15Google Scholar) using d-biotin (Sigma) and BirA enzyme. Excess biotin was removed by gel filtration. Surface Plasmon Resonance—SPR analysis of biomolecular interactions between the MHC class I monomers and human soluble CD8αα (sCD8αα) was performed on a BIAcore 3000™ (BIAcore AB, St. Albans, UK). sCD8αα was prepared as described previously (36Glick M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A.L. Andersen T.B. Hutchinson S.L. Laugel B. Sewell A.K. Boulter J.M. Dunbar P.R. Cerundolo V. Oxenius A. Bell J.I. Richards W.G. Jakobsen B.K. J. Biol.

For analysis, all proteins were diluted into HBS-EP buffer (BIAcore AB) containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Surfactant P20. Standard amine coupling kit (BIAcore AB) was used to activate the surface of a research grade CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB). Streptavidin was covalently coupled to the chip surface via primary amines by injecting a 0.2 mg/ml streptavidin solution (Sigma) diluted in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, over the surface. Biotinylated monomers were immobilized onto the chip surface at ∼1000 response units (RU) in each flow cell. Serial dilutions of sCD8αα diluted in HBS-EP buffer were flowed over the chip to generate equilibrium binding data. Data were analyzed using BIAeval, Microsoft Excel, and Origin version 6.1 (Microcal software). KD values were calculated by non-linear curve fitting assuming 1:1 Langmuir binding (A + B ↔ AB) using the equation AB = B × ABmax/(KD + B) and were verified by linear regression analysis of Scatchard plots. Tetramerization and Flow Cytometry—Biotinylated pMHCI monomers were conjugated by addition of extravidin-R-phycoerythrin (Sigma) at a pMHCI:extravidin molar ratio of 4:1 to produce tetrameric pMHCI complexes. Once prepared, tetramers were stored in the dark at 4 °C. 1 × 105 CD8+ CTL in 20 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were stained with 1 μg of phycoerythrin-tetramer (pMHCI content) for 20 min at 37 °C, washed twice in PBS, and then analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with Cell Quest software. All pMHCI multimers used in this study were made fresh for the week of use from pMHCI monomers stored at –80 °C to avoid the effect of the stability differences documented in Fig. 3. Where comparisons were made between the activation induced by different pMHCI multimers they were tested by FACS to ensure that they exhibited an equal ability to bind to cell surface TCR. ELISA for Soluble Lymphokines—Immortalized B cell lines were washed once in RPMI media and pulsed with peptide for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Peptide-pulsed B cell lines and CTL were each washed twice in RPMI and brought to a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. 5 × 104 CTL and 5 × 104 B cells were incubated together in a 200 μl final volume for 4 h or 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in 96-well U-bottomed plates. Supernatant was harvested with care not to disturb cells and assayed for MIP-1β and RANTES by ELISA (R & D Systems). Standard deviation from the mean of two duplicate assays is shown. ELISpot Assay for Single-cell IFN-γ Release—96-Well polyvinylidene difluoride-backed plates (Millipore) were coated with IFN-γ capture antibody 1-DIK (Mabtech) at 15 μg/ml, and blocked with RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum. 5 × 104 B cells and 2 × 102 CTL ± peptide were applied to duplicate wells of pre-coated plates and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Plates were washed 6 times with PBS (Sigma) at room temperature and incubated for 90 min with 1 μg/ml anti-IFN-mAb-7B6-1 biotin (Mabtech). After 6 further washes, a 1:1000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Mabtech) was added and incubated at room temperature for 40 min. After further washing, chromogenic AP substrate (Bio-Rad) was added for 30 min and development was stopped by rinsing twice with water. Spots were counted mechanically using an ELISpot Reader system ELR02 (Autoimmun Diagnostika; Strassberg). Standard deviation from the mean of two duplicate assays is shown. Stimulation of CTL for Subsequent Immunoblotting—CTL were washed twice in RPMI and incubated overnight in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum. The following day, fetal calf serum was washed off with two changes of RPMI and 106 CTL were resuspended in 10 μl of RPMI. After 10 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2, CTL were stimulated by incubation with 1 μg/ml tetramer for 3 min. The reaction was stopped by washing once with 0.5 ml of ice-cold PBS, and re-suspending the pellet in cold lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1% IGEPAL, 1 mm Na3VO4,10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) at 5 × 107 cells/ml. Antiphosphotyrosine Immunoblots—Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min, then the nuclear fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The remaining lysate was aspirated and added to an equal volume of SDS loading buffer (350 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 350 mm SDS, 30% glycerol, 600 mm dithiothreitol, 175 μm bromophenol blue). The sample was boiled for 6 min with agitation and then loaded into a 12% SDS-PAGE protein gel for electrophoresis at 100 V for 16 h. The gel, filter papers (Bio-Rad), and nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences) of matching size were equilibrated in ice-cold transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol) for 10 min. Protein was transferred from the gel by electrophoresis at 25 V for 50 min. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and the membrane stained with Ponceau S to verify transfer and equal protein loading. Ponceau S was washed off with distilled water and then wash buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween). The membrane was blocked for 1 h with wash buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin, washed, and incubated for 4 h with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody clone 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, 1:1000 in wash buffer, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The membrane was washed again with 3 changes of wash buffer for 10 min each, and incubated with sheep anti-mouse peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences, 1:2000 in wash buffer, 2.5% milk powder) for 1.5 h. After 3 further washes the blot was developed using chemiluminescent substrate Supersignal Pico (Perbio). All washes and incubations with antibody were performed at 4 °C. At least 48 h after development, blots were re-probed for total cellular ZAP 70 to control for protein loading. To re-probe, the membrane was re-hydrated in wash buffer then incubated with rabbit anti-human ZAP 70 primary antibody (Autogen Bioclear, 1:1000 in wash buffer, 2.5% milk powder) for 4 h. The blot was washed 3 times and incubated with peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Autogen Bioclear, 1:1000 in wash buffer, 2.5% milk powder) for 1.5 h, then washed again and developed as above. Manufacture of C1R-HLA A68-expressing Cells—Human HLA A68 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription of total RNA extracted from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and PCR amplification of the specific cDNA. The cDNA was cloned as a BamHI-EcoRI fragment in the retroviral vector pLNSX (Clontech) to obtain the vector A6801-pLNSX. The D227K/T228A mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The plasmids were introduced by calcium phosphate precipitation into the xenotropic packaging cell line PG13 (American Type Culture Collection) for the production of recombinant retroviral vectors. After 2 weeks of selection in G418 (800 μg/ml; Sigma) supernatant from producing cells was harvested and used for transduction of C1R (39Storkus W. Howell D. Salter R. Dawson J. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 1657-1659Google Scholar) target cells. 5 × 106 cells were transduced using 5 ml of viral supernatant in the presence of protamine at a concentration of 8 μg/ml (Sigma) for 16 h and subsequently grown in selective medium containing G418 (400 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. Cell surface expression of HLA A68 and D227K/T228A HLA A68 was quantified by flow cytometry. 106 retrovirally transduced cells were washed in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 1 μg of anti-HLA class I (W6/32) antibody for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed twice in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. Correct refolding of HLA A68 and D227K/T228A HLA A68 on the surface of C1R cells was confirmed by CTL assay. Both of these cells were able to present antigen to HLA A68-restricted CTL when pulsed with very high levels of peptide antigen (>10 mm) and used in ELISpot assays as described above. Generation and Validation of pMHCI and β2m Mutations That Reduce the CD8 Coreceptor Interaction—The CD8 coreceptor makes contacts with both the α3 domain, MHC class I heavy chain and β2m (5Gao G.F.

We have described mutations in the MHC heavy chain/β2m complex that reduce the affinity of the pMHCI/CD8 interaction without affecting the integrity of the TCR-binding platform (12Purbhoo M.A. Boulter J.M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20840-20846Google Scholar). The binding of CD8 to D227K/T228A HLA A2 is below the current limits of detection by SPR (12Purbhoo M.A. Boulter J.M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A.L. Hourigan C.S. Dunbar P.R. Olson K. Dawson S.J. Phillips R.E. Jakobsen B.K. Bell J.I. Sewell A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32786-32792Google Scholar). We simulated non-linear curves on our data by using the equation y = (P1 × x)/(P2 + x) and are confident we would be able to detect binding of CD8 to pMHCI with a KD as low as 10 mm. Consequently we are confident that the D227K/T228A mutation reduces the binding of CD8 to HLA-A2 by over 50-fold. We have also previously determined that wild type and D227K/T228 HLA A2 bind to an HLA A2 influenza matrix-specific TCR (JM22) and HLA A2 HTLV-1 Tax-specific TCR (A6) equally well (12Purbhoo M.A. Boulter J.M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A.L. Hourigan C.S. Dunbar P.R. Olson K. Dawson S.J. Phillips R.E. Jakobsen B.K. Bell J.I. Sewell A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32786-32792Google Scholar). Similarly we have confirmed that the K58E substitution in β2m has no effect on the binding of TCR (36Glick M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A.L. Andersen T.B. Hutchinson S.L. Laugel B. Sewell A.K. Boulter J.M. Dunbar P.R. Cerundolo V. Oxenius A. Bell J.I. Richards W.G. Jakobsen B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20840-20846Google Scholar). The interaction of soluble CD8αα (sCD8) with HLA A2 complexed with the HIV-1, p17 Gag-derived peptide SLYNTVATL, and β2m containing the K58E substitution was reduced by more than 15-fold compared with the SLYNTVATL-HLA A2 complex folded with wild type β2m (KD > 2 mm) (Fig. 1). We have reported that HLA A2 complexed with the influenza matrix-derived peptide GILGFVFTL and K58Eβ2m exhibits greatly reduced binding to sCD8 (36Glick M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A.L. Andersen T.B. Hutchinson S.L. Laugel B. Sewell A.K. Boulter J.M. Dunbar P.R. Cerundolo V. Oxenius A. Bell J.I. Richards W.G. Jakobsen B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20840-20846Google Scholar). This result was confirmed here to ensure comparability of results (Fig. 1). Curiously, wild type HLA A2 complexed with wild type β2m and GILGFVFTL peptide bound sCD8 with a lower affinity than HLA A2 presenting other peptides (data not shown). This result is in agreement with previous measurements that show that ILKEPVHGV-HLA A2 (34Gao G.F. Willcox B.E. Wyer J.R. Boulter J.M. O'Callaghan C.A. Maenaka K. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. Van Der Merwe P.A. Bell J.I. Jakobsen B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15232-15238Google Scholar) has a higher affinity for CD8 (KD = 130 μm) than HLA A2 folded with GILGFVFTL peptide (KD = 195 μm) (36Glick M. Price D.A. Vuidepot A.L. Andersen T.B. Hutchinson S.L. Laugel B. Sewell A.K. Boulter J.M. Dunbar P.R. Cerundolo V. Oxenius A. Bell J.I. Richards W.G. Jakobsen B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20840-20846Google Scholar). It is not clear whether this effect is due to peptide-induced structural changes transmitted to the HLA A2 α3 domain or an artifact of protein folding with the GILGFVFTL peptide. As with the wild type complexes, GILGFVFTL-HLA A2/K58Eβ2m exhibited slightly lower CD8 binding than SLYNTVATL-HLA A2/K58Eβ2m (Fig. 1). Mutations in pMHCI and β2m That Reduce the CD8 Coreceptor Interaction Do Not Reduce the Binding of Peptide—MHC class I structures show that the α3 domain mutations utilized in this study are removed from the α1/α2 peptide-binding platform of these molecules and therefore are unlikely to have direct effects on the binding of peptide (5Gao G.F. Tormo J. Gerth U.C. Wyer J.R. McMichael A.J. Stuart D.I. Bell J.I. Jones E.Y. Jakobsen B.K. Nature. 1997; 387: 630-634Google Scholar). The in vitro refolding efficiency of pMHCI is highly dependent on the ability of peptide to bind (40Goulder P.J. Reid S.W. Price D.A. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A.J. Phillips R.E. Jones E.Y. Eur. J.

Phillips R.E. Jones E.Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1515-1521Google Scholar). We find that this technique is more sensitive than traditional ways of measuring peptide binding (41Elvin J. Cerundolo V.

https://openalex.org/W1985264276,"Understanding the mechanisms that regulate cell migration is important for devising novel therapies to control metastasis or enhance wound healing. Previously, we demonstrated that β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) activation in keratinocytes inhibited their migration by decreasing the phosphorylation of a critical promigratory signaling component, the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK). Here we demonstrate that β2-AR-induced inhibition of migration is mediated by the activation of the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A. Pretreating human keratinocytes with the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, prevented the β2-AR-induced inhibition of migration, either as isolated cells or as a confluent sheet of cells repairing an in vitro “wound” and also prevented the β2-AR-induced reduction in ERK phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained with human corneal epithelial cells. In keratinocytes, immunoprecipitation studies revealed that β2-AR activation resulted in the rapid association of β2-AR with PP2A as well as a 37% increase in association of PP2A with ERK2. Finally, β2-AR activation resulted in a rapid and transient 2-fold increase in PP2A activity. Thus, we provide the first evidence that β2-AR activation in keratinocytes modulates migration via a novel pathway utilizing PP2A to alter the promigratory signaling cascade. Exploiting this pathway may result in novel therapeutic approaches for control of epithelial cell migration.

When skin is wounded, keratinocytes within the epidermis must migrate from the wound edges to re-epithelialize the wound surface (1Woodley D. O'Toole E. Nadelman C.M. Li W. Dermatol. Found. 1999; 33: 1-12Google Scholar). One of the best characterized mediators of keratinocyte migration is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; β2-AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; ISO, isoproterenol; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; OA, okadaic acid; KGM, keratinocyte growth medium; AHCE, adult human corneal epithelial.

The MAP kinase pathway is usually only transiently activated, and its constitutive activation is sufficient to cause the oncogenic transformation of some cell types (10Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P.

In addition to the EGFR, keratinocytes also express high levels of the G-protein-coupled receptor, the β2-adrenergic receptor, (β2-AR) (14Schallreuter K.U. Wood J.M. Pittelkow M.R. Swanson N.N.

Earlier studies have investigated the role of β-ARs in epithelial wound healing and migration, but the results have been paradoxical. β-Antagonists have been reported to either delay (17Haruta Y.

Since keratinocytes have the capacity to synthesize β2-AR agonists and express a high level of the receptor (25Schallreuter K.U. J. Invest. Dermatol. Symp.

Surprisingly, we found that unlike other cell types studied, where β2-AR agonist binding activates ERK (26Zou Y. Yao A. Zhu W. Kudoh S. Hiroi Y. Shimoyama M. Uozumi H. Kohmoto O. Takahashi T.

Keratinocyte migration was also reduced in a dose-dependent and cAMP-independent manner (33Chen J. Hoffman B.B. Isseroff R.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which a β2-AR agonist reduced MAP kinase signaling and keratinocyte migration, however, remained enigmatic. We reasoned that the serine/threonine phosphatase, PP2A, known to play a role in a multitude of cellular functions (reviewed in Ref. 34Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar), could be a good candidate for the mediation of the observed β2-AR agonist effects. A number of studies have linked β2-AR activation to either PP2A function, ERK activation, or migration. ISO can increase the activation of PP2A in the rat heart (35Boknik P. Fockenbrock M. Herzig S.

We therefore evaluated the possibility that the observed β2-AR-induced decrease in ERK phosphorylation and migration in human keratinocytes could be regulated by the β2-AR agonist-mediated activation of PP2A. Using okadaic acid (OA) to inhibit intracellular PP2A (41Namboodiripad A.N. Jennings M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C449-C456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S.

Chem. 2002; 9: 229-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that OA pretreatment completely prevented the β2-AR agonist-induced decrease in keratinocyte migration in two different in vitro migration assays. Likewise, OA pretreatment also prevented the β2-AR agonist-induced reduction in ERK phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained in human corneal epithelial cells; OA pretreatment completely prevented the β2-AR agonist-induced decrease in wound healing and also prevented the β2-AR agonist-induced reduction in ERK phosphorylation. Further, treating keratinocytes with ISO increased the intracellular association of PP2A with ERK2 and initiated the association of β2-AR with PP2A. Finally, the β2-AR agonist rapidly and transiently increased intracellular PP2A activity. Here we provide the first evidence that PP2A plays a crucial role in the β2-AR agonist-mediated decrease in ERK phosphorylation and provides a novel regulatory mechanism of epithelial cell migration. Keratinocyte Growth—Human keratinocytes were isolated from primary keratinocyte cultures derived from neonatal and adult foreskins as we have reported previously (45Isseroff R.R. Ziboh V.A. Chapkin R.S. Martinez D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 1342-1349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using a modification of the method of Rheinwald and Green (46Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3936) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in keratinocyte growth medium (KGM) (Medium 154; 0.2 mm Ca2+), supplemented with human keratinocyte growth supplement (0.2 ng/ml EGF, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.18 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 0.2% bovine pituitary extract) (Cascade Biologics, Inc., Portland, OR) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin) (Gemini Bio-Products, Inc., Calabasas, CA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Since keratinocyte migration is optimal on a collagen matrix (1Woodley D. O'Toole E. Nadelman C.M. Li W. Dermatol. Found. 1999; 33: 1-12Google Scholar, 47Sheridan D.M. Isseroff R.R. Nuccitelli R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 642-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), all experiments were performed on cells plated for 2 h at 37 °C on glass coverslips (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) or plastic tissue culture dishes (Corning Glass) that had been coated for 1 h at 37 °C with 60 μg/ml collagen I (Celtrix Pharmaceuticals, Santa Clara, CA). Cell strains isolated from at least two different foreskins were used, and experiments were performed with subcultured cells between passages 4 and 7. Neonatal keratinocytes were used in all experiments except where noted. Corneal Epithelial Cell Growth—Human adult corneas that had been donated for research were obtained from the Sierra Eye and Tissue Donor Services (Sacramento, CA; a regional center of Dialysis Clinics Inc., Donor Services, Nashville, TN) within 2–10 days of collection. Corneas were stored in Optisol-GS corneal storage medium (Chiron Ophthalmics, Irvine, CA) at 2–8 °C and were transported to the laboratory on ice. The research followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, tissue was obtained with appropriate consents from either donor or next of kin, and the research was approved by the University institutional review board. Corneal epithelial cells were isolated as we have described (48Han B. Schwab I.R. Madsen T.K. Isseroff R.R. Cornea. 2002; 21: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in EpiLife medium (Cascade Biologics) supplemented with 0.18 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.2% bovine pituitary extract, and 1 ng/ml mouse EGF, calcium (final concentration 0.06 mm), and antibiotics/antimycotic (100 units of penicillin G/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 0.25 μg of amphotericin B/ml). Passage 3–5 cells were used for all experiments. Scratch Assay—Cells were grown to confluence on collagen-coated plastic tissue culture dishes. A sterile pipette tip was used to scratch a 1-mm-wide wound along the center of the dish, and a demarcated area of the wound was photographed on an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope at the time of wounding (time 0) up to wound healing (49Haas A.F. Isseroff R.R. Wheeland R.G. Rood P.A. Graves P.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 822-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The area of the wound was determined using NIH Image 1.6 (public domain image processing and analysis program for the Macintosh developed at the National Institutes of health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/), and the percentage of wound healing was calculated by dividing the area of the wound at time X by the area of the wound at time 0 and multiplying by 100. In some experiments, to prevent cell proliferation, which could confound the analysis of cell migration into the wound, cells were preincubated with mitomycin C (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C (50You Y.S. Lim S.J. Chung H.S. Lee Y.G. Kim C.Y. Hong Y.J. Yonsei Med. J. 2000; 41: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To confirm that the observed reduction in keratinocyte migration induced by ISO was due to β2-AR activation, in some experiments, human keratinocytes were preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of timolol (20 μm), a β2-AR antagonist. Significance was determined using Student's t test. Single Cell Migration Assay—Cells were plated onto collagen-coated glass coverslips at a density of 50 cells/mm2 for 2 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were then placed into a migration chamber to monitor individual cell migration over a 1-h period at 37 °C, as described previously (4Fang K.S. Ionides E. Oster G. Nuccitelli R. Isseroff R.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1967-1978PubMed Google Scholar). The migration chamber was placed on an inverted Nikon Diaphot microscope. Time lapse images of the cell migratory paths were digitally captured to a video frame grabber on a Power Macintosh 8500/120 every 10 min for a 1-h period and imported to a recompiled version of NIH Image 1.60. After each cell's center of mass was tracked, the data were automatically exported to FileMaker Pro 3.0, where they were analyzed and stored. Cell migration was quantitatively analyzed, and the speed and distance traveled by each cell were calculated using a cell tracking program compiled in this laboratory (3Fang K.S. Farboud B. Nuccitelli R. Isseroff R.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 751-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Significance was determined using Student's t test. Cell Treatments—1–2 × 106 cells were preincubated with either KGM alone or KGM containing 10 nm OA for 45 min at 37 °C. OA inhibits purified PP2A with a half-maximal concentration on the order of 1 nm; it also inhibits PP1, but at 100-fold higher concentrations in vitro (51Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar, 52Cohen P. Klumpp S. Schelling D.L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 250: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). OA is membrane-permeant (41Namboodiripad A.N. Jennings M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C449-C456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it can be added to cells up to concentrations of 1 μm without any detectable intracellular inhibitory effect on PP1, PP2B, or PP2C (42Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Cells were then stimulated with KGM containing either 10 ng/ml EGF (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA), 10 nm ISO (Calbiochem), 10 nm OA (Calbiochem), 10 nm ISO plus 10 nm OA, or KGM alone (control) for 15 min at 37 °C unless otherwise noted. Cells were placed immediately on ice, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF and 1 mm Na3VO4), and scraped in 50 μl to 1 ml of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were transferred into 1.5-ml tubes, incubated on ice for 20 min, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C (53Pullar C.E. Repetto B. Gilfillan A.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1226-1232PubMed Google Scholar). The supernatants were electrophoresed immediately on 10% polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) or stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration of the samples was determined using the Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting—Five μg of each protein sample was added to an equal volume of 2× reducing sample loading buffer (0.0625 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gels. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes and immunoblotted with either an anti-ERK (9102), anti-MEK1 (9122), anti-phospho-ERK (9101), antiphospho-MEK (9121) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-PP2A (C-20), anti-EGFR (1005), anti-β2-AR (H-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Ab-4) (Oncogene, Boston, MA). The immunoblots were developed by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Densitometry was performed on scanned images using NIH Image 1.6. Immunoprecipitation—Five μg of antibody linked to 30 μl of prewashed protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was used to immunoprecipitate the desired proteins from 1 ml of keratinocyte cell lysate prepared from 1–2 × 107 cells. Lysates were initially precleared with 150 μl of prewashed beads for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with the antibody-bound beads at 4 °C overnight on a rotary mixer. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, 1× reducing sample loading buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 3 min and centrifuged to pellet the beads. The supernatants were loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad), and the proteins were separated electrophoretically followed by transfer to Immobilon membrane for immunoblotting as outlined above. Phosphatase Assay—Phosphatase activity was measured using the nonradioactive serine/threonine phosphatase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). The system determines the amount of free phosphate released from a phosphopeptide by measuring the absorbance of a molybdate-malachite green-phosphate complex. Cells were either untreated or stimulated with 10 μm ISO for 30 s at 37 °C. The plates were placed immediately on ice, washed in washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8), and lysed in a phosphate-free buffer containing no phosphatase inhibitors (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)). The lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Control and ISO-treated keratinocyte cell lysates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C through lysis buffer-washed Sephadex-25 spin columns to remove free phosphate. Twenty-five μg of lysate in the presence or absence of the PP2A-specific serine/threonine phosphopeptide substrate (RRApTVA, where pT represents phosphothreonine) (100 μm) was incubated for 3 min at 30 °C in PP2A-specific buffer (50 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 200 μm EGTA, 0.02% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) in a reaction volume of 50 μl in a 96-well plate to determine PP2A activity. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of molybdate dye additive. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow full color development. Absorbance was measured at 630 nm in a plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). Significance was determined using Student's t test. OA Reversed the β2-AR Agonist-induced Inhibition of Keratinocyte Wound Healing—Our previous work demonstrated that activation of β2-AR in human keratinocytes decreased their migratory speed (33Chen J. Hoffman B.B. Isseroff R.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We then reasoned that if β2-AR-mediated activation of PP2A was responsible for the ISO-induced decrease in migration, then preincubating cells with OA should prevent it. We chose to initially investigate the effects of ISO and OA on keratinocyte migration using a “scratch” assay that provided an in vitro model of wound healing (49Haas A.F. Isseroff R.R. Wheeland R.G. Rood P.A. Graves P.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 822-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This allowed the monitoring of keratinocyte migration at the edge of “wounds” generated in vitro by scraping a cell-free zone in a confluent sheet of cells. The contribution of cell proliferation to the in vitro wound healing was abrogated by pretreating cultures with mitomycin C. Control wounds, incubated in EGF-containing culture medium, completely healed in 24 h, whereas at that time ISO-treated cells were only 62% healed (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). Pretreatment of cells with OA (10 nm) prior to ISO, however, reversed the ISO-induced defects in wound repair, resulting in complete wound healing at 24 h. OA alone had no effect on the rate of wound closure. Although healing was delayed with ISO treatment, the wounds did heal by 36 h (results not shown), demonstrating that the observed decrease in migratory speed was not due to nonspecific toxicity. To demonstrate that the ISO-induced reduction in wound healing was the result of its specific receptor activation, the receptor was prebound with a β2-AR antagonist, timolol. A 15-min preincubation with timolol (20 μm) completely prevented the ISO-induced reduction in wound healing (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that the ISO-induced effects on migration were specifically through activating the β2-AR. The ISO-treated cells were only 60% healed by 24 h but did heal completely by 36 h (results not shown). OA Reversed the β2-AR Agonist-induced Reduction of Keratinocyte Migratory Speed—Since OA treatment completely prevented the β2-AR-induced reduction in wound healing, this suggested that PP2A may likewise play a role in the β2-AR agonist-induced decrease in keratinocyte migration. To more precisely measure the β2-AR agonist-induced reduction in keratinocyte speed, we quantitated the locomotory speed of individual cells (47Sheridan D.M. Isseroff R.R. Nuccitelli R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 642-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The addition of ISO to the migration chamber reduced both the mean distance traveled and the speed by half (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2, A and B). OA pretreatment completely prevented the ISO-induced reduction in both distance and speed traveled by the cells over the 1-h period. Preincubation with OA alone did not significantly affect either distance traveled or speed (Fig. 2, A and B). There was no statistically significant difference between the control, OA, and OA/ISO groups. OA pretreatment also prevented the ISO-induced reduction in migratory speed of keratinocytes isolated from adult foreskins (results not shown). These results, demonstrating OA-mediated restitution of keratinocyte migratory speed in ISO-treated cells, complement those obtained in the scratch assay, providing additional support for the hypothesis that PP2A activation mediates the decrease in migration speed observed after β2-AR agonist treatment. OA Reversed the β2-AR Agonist-induced Dephosphorylation of ERK in Human Keratinocytes—The ability of OA to restore migration in β2-AR agonist-treated cells prompted us to investigate whether it could also prevent the β2-AR-mediated decrease in ERK phosphorylation observed in our earlier work (33Chen J. Hoffman B.B. Isseroff R.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1261-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In order to determine the mechanism by which β2-AR activation resulted in decreased ERK phosphorylation, we examined critical members of the ERK/MAP kinase pathway (Fig. 7) after treating cells with ISO and or OA. First, the ability of β2-AR ligation to transactivate the EGFR, as previously reported (54Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A.

https://openalex.org/W2011458495,"We have recently reported the identification of a novel member of the leukocyte receptor family, osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR), which has two Ig-like domains and functions as a bone-specific regulator of osteoclast differentiation. Here, we have cloned the OSCAR promoter region to examine its regulation by transcription factors. The 1.7-kb promoter region of the mouse OSCAR gene contains two potential E-box elements for microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) and three putative PU.1 sites. MITF or PU.1 alone activates the OSCAR reporter construct 5–6-fold, and the combination of MITF and PU.1 synergistically activates the OSCAR reporter activity up to 110-fold. The mRNA expression patterns of MITF, PU.1, and OSCAR in TRANCE-treated (RAW 264.7) or TRANCE/M-CSF-treated cells (primary osteoclasts) reveal that MITF mRNA expression is induced at a much earlier time point than OSCAR gene expression. In contrast to MITF, PU.1 mRNA levels remain relatively constant at all time points, suggesting that TRANCE-induced MITF, not PU.1 expression, is one of the critical regulatory mechanisms for optimal OSCAR expression during osteoclastogenesis. In addition, we have shown that the combination of MITF and constitutively active MKK6-expressing plasmids synergistically activates OSCAR reporter activity. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that PU.1 and MITF transcription factors synergistically activate OSCAR gene expression. Moreover, the activation of OSCAR gene expression by PU.1/MITF is further enhanced by the TRANCE-induced MKK6/p38 signaling cascade.

Bone is a dynamic tissue that provides mechanical support, physical protection, and a storage site for systemic mineral homeostasis. Bone is continuously remodeled and balanced through the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts, originating from osteoprogenitor cells, are responsible for the mineralization of bone matrix. Osteoclasts, differentiated from hematopoietic cells, are unique cells that can resorb mineralized bone. Two essential factors, M-CSF 1The abbreviations used are: M-CSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; OSCAR, osteoclast-associated receptor; TRANCE, tumor necrosis factor-related activation-induced cytokine; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; MITF, microphthalmia transcription factor; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; WT, wild type. and TRANCE, are produced by osteoblasts and can support osteoclast differentiation from monocyte/macrophage lineage cells (1Suda T.

In addition to M-CSF and TRANCE, osteotropic factors such as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, parathyroid hormone, prostaglandin E2, and interleukin-11 can stimulate osteoclast formation via up-regulation of TRANCE expression (1Suda T.

The MITF gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix zipper protein that is important for differentiation of osteoclasts (18Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Arnheiter H. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Google Scholar). A mutant allele of the MITF gene, mi, encodes a protein lacking one of four arginines in the basic region of MITF protein that is critical for binding to target genes. MITFmi/mi mutant mice exhibit severe osteopetrosis caused by failure of mononuclear precursors to mature into multinuclear osteoclasts capable of bone resorption (19Holtrop M.E. Cox K.A. Eilon G.

It has been shown that MITF regulates expression of the tartarate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K genes during osteoclast differentiation by binding to E-box-type enhancers in the 5′-flanking regions of MITF-responsive genes (19Holtrop M.E.

Moreover, Mansky et al. (24Mansky K.C. Sankar U. Han J. Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11077-11083Google Scholar) showed that TRANCE signaling in primary osteoclasts resulted in MITF phosphorylation mediated by a MKK6/p38 signaling cascade that correlated with TRAP expression. These results indicate that MITF is a direct target of TRANCE/p38 signaling pathways essential for osteoclast differentiation and function. The ETS family transcription factor PU.1 is preferentially expressed in the hematopoietic cell lineage and plays a pivotal role in the differentiation of a number of cell types, including B cells, macrophages, and osteoclasts (25Simon M.C. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 111-118Google Scholar, 26Singh H. DeKoter R.P. Walsh J.C. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 13-20Google Scholar). Although PU.1 is expressed at all stages of osteoclast differentiation in wild type cells, osteoclasts from PU.1 knockout mice show a failure to differentiate at a very early stage, eventually leading to an osteopetrotic phenotype. It has also been reported that direct interactions between MITF and PU.1 are necessary for osteoclast gene expression and differentiation (27Luchin A. Suchting S. Merson T. Rosol T.J. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36703-36710Google Scholar). We have recently shown that OSCAR, a novel member of the leukocyte receptor complex-encoded family, is specifically expressed in osteoclasts and regulates osteoclastogenesis (28Kim N. Takami M. Rho J. Josien R. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 201-209Google Scholar). Genes in the leukocyte receptor complex family encode different types of Ig-like surface receptors and play critical roles in the regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. As opposed to other members of the leukocyte receptor complex family, OSCAR expression has only been detected in preosteoclasts and mature osteoclasts, and it has been suggested that OSCAR may play an important role as a bone-specific regulator (28Kim N. Takami M. Rho J. Josien R. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 201-209Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether osteoclast-specific OSCAR gene expression is also regulated by both MITF and PU.1. We report here that OSCAR expression is regulated by the combined activity of MITF and PU.1. For this cooperation, binding of MITF to its cognate sites in the OSCAR promoter is critical, whereas binding of PU.1 to its recognition sites is dispensable. In addition, the induction of the OSCAR gene is further regulated by TRANCE/p38/MITF signaling cascades. Therefore, this study indicates that the expression of a novel osteoclast-specific gene, OSCAR, is regulated by both TRANCE/p38/MITF signaling pathways and a cooperative transactivation between MITF and PU.1. Reagents—All cell culture media and supplements were obtained from Invitrogen. Soluble recombinant mouse TRANCE was purified from insect cells as described (7Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Sauter B. Li H.L. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 2075-2080Google Scholar), and recombinant human M-CSF was a gift from Dr. Daved Fremont (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). TRIZOL was purchased from Invitrogen. The Ready-to-Go labeling kit and ProbeQuant G-50 purification kit were from Amersham Biosciences. Bone Marrow- or Splenocyte-derived Osteoclast Generation and Total RNA Preparation—Murine osteoclasts were prepared from bone marrow cells or splenocytes as previously described (28Kim N. Takami M.

In brief, bone marrow-derived cells (1 × 107/100-mm dish) from C57BL/6 mice (4–6 weeks of age) were incubated with M-CSF (5 ng/ml) in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 16 h. After incubation, the floating cells were collected and further cultured with M-CSF (30 ng/ml), TRANCE (1 μg/ml), and prostaglandin E2 (1 × 10–6m) for 4 days. On day 3, media containing M-CSF, TRANCE, and prostaglandin E2 were replaced. On day 4, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and then harvested. Total RNA was prepared using the TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA samples were electrophoresed and transferred to nylon membranes as described (7Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Sauter B. Li H.L. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Exp.

Hybridization was performed at 42 °C for 16 h with a [32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probe prepared using the Ready-to-Go labeling kit and ProbeQuant G-50 purification kit. After washing with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 56 °C for 1 h, the membrane was exposed to x-ray film. Expression Vectors and OSCAR Promoter Luciferase Constructs— The wild type (MITF-WT) and MITFmi/mi mutant type (MITF-mi/mi) genes were made by PCR amplification from recombinant adenoviruses (23Motyckova G. Weilbaecher K.N. Horstmann M. Rieman D.J. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5798-5803Google Scholar). The primers are as follows: MITF-WT, 5′-CCC AAG CTT ATG CTG GAA ATG CTA GAA TAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CCT AAC AAG TGT GCT CCG TCT C-3′ (antisense); MITF-mi/mi, 5′-CCC AAG CTT ATG CTG GAA ATG CTA GAA TAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CCT AAC ACG CAT GCT CCG TTT C-3′ (antisense). These fragments were then cloned into the HindIII and NotI sites of the pFLAG CMV2 vector. The murine full-length of PU.1 DNA was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR-amplified using RNA from primary osteoclasts. The primers are as follows: 5′-CAC AAG CTT ATG TTA CAG GCG TGC AAA ATG GAA GGG-3′ (5′ PU.1 HindIII) and 5′-ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CTC AGT GGG GCG GGA GGC GCC-3′ (3′ PU.1 NotI). This amplified PCR fragment was digested with HindIII and NotI and cloned into the pFLAG CMV2 vector. All expression plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The 1.7-kb OSCAR promoter region (–1626 to +68 bp; +1 is the transcription start site) was amplified from mouse genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: 5′-AAG CGG CCG CGA GCG ACA GTA ATG TCA GGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCC CTC GAG CCG TGG AGC TGA GGA AAA GGT-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was then cloned into the pCR2.1 TOPO TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), digested with NotI and XhoI, and cloned into the pGL2 basic luciferase vector (pGL2 OSCAR 1.7) (Promega). Deletion mutants of the E-boxes, pGL2 OSCAR 1.0 (–906 to +68) and pGL2 OSCAR 0.1 (+2 to +68), were generated by PCR and cloned into pGL2 basic vector. Point mutations of E-box 1 and E-box 2 in the OSCAR promoter were generated by the QuikChange method of site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were as follows: E-box 1 point mut, 5′-GGT TTA ATT TCC AGT AAC GAG ATG GTG ACT GCA CCA TCT GC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCA GAT GGT GCA ACC ATC TCG TTA CTG GAA ATT AAA CC-3′ (antisense); E-box 2 point mut, 5′-CCC TAA ACA GGA CTC TGA GAT GGC TTT CTG GTG TTG CTT C-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAA GCA ACA CCA GAA AGC CAT CTC AGA GTC CTG TTT AGG G-3′ (antisense). Point mutations within the PU.1 box 1, 2, and 3 of the OSCAR promoter region were also generated by the QuikChange method of site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were as follows: PU.1 box 1 point mut, 5′-CGC CCA GGC ATT CTT GAT TAA GGC AGA TTC CTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TAG GAA TCT CTG GCC TTA ATC AAG AAT GCC TGG GCG-3′ (antisense); PU.1 box 2 point mut, 5′-GTT GTT GTT GTT TTA ATC TTT TCC ATT TTT CTT CCT CCC ACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGT GGG AGG AAG AAA AAT GGA AAA GAT TAA AAC AAC AAC AAC-3′ (antisense); PU.1 box 3 point mut, 5′-TTT TCC ATT TTT CTT AAT CCC ACC TGC CCC TTT CC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGA AAG GGG CAG GTG GGA TTA AGA AAA ATG GAA AA-3′ (antisense). Constitutively active MKK6 expression plasmid was previously described (24Mansky K.C. Sankar U. Han J. Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11077-11083Google Scholar). Transfection and Luciferase Assay—For transfection of reporter plasmids, 293T cells were plated on 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well on 1 day before transfection. A total of 860 ng of plasmid DNA including 100 ng of luciferase reporter, 250 ng of MITF expression vector, 500 ng of PU.1 expression vector, and 10 ng of pcDNA3-β-gal, except as noted, was transfected into 293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation as described (30Wong B.R. Josien R. Lee S.Y. Vologodskaia M. Steinman R.M. Choi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28355-28359Google Scholar). The amount of transfected DNA was held constant to 860 ng by the addition of empty vector DNA where necessary. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and then lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was measured in triplicate, averaged, and then normalized with β-galactosidase activity using the galactosidase assay system (Galacto-Light; Tropix Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RAW264.7 transfection, cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, seeded at 5 × 104/well in 24-well plates, and cultured for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with a total of 2 μg of plasmid, 6 μl of Tfx™-50 reagent (Promega), and 200 μl of serum-free medium. After a 1-h incubation, 800 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added, and cells were cultured for 48 h. After 48 h of transfection, luciferase activity was measured. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Osteoclast nuclear extracts were made as previously described (23Motyckova G. Weilbaecher K.N. Horstmann M. Rieman D.J. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5798-5803Google Scholar). The double strand oligonucleotide probes containing E-box 1 or E-box 2 were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). 50,000 cpm-labeled probes were incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extract and 1 μg of poly(dIdC) in a final volume of 20 μl of reaction buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m KCl, and 5% glycerol. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and resolved on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. E-box 1 and E-box 2 oligonucleotides encompassing nucleotides –938 to –916 and –15 to +8 of mouse OSCAR promoter, respectively, were used as probes and cold competitors. Two E-box wild and mutant type sequences are as follows: E-box 1 wild type (WT), 5′-TCC AGT AAC CAC ATG GTG ACT GC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GC AGT CAC CAT GTG GTT ACT GGA-3′ (antisense); E-box 1 mutant type (mut), 5′-TCC AGT AAC GAG ATG GTG ACT GC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GC AGT CAC CAT CTC GTT ACT GGA-3′ (antisense); E-box 2 WT, 5′-CAG GAC TCT CAC ATG GCT TTC TG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CA GAA AGC CAT GTG AGA GTC CTG-3′ (antisense), E-box 2 mut, 5′-CAG GAC TCT GAG ATG GCT TTC TG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CA GAA AGC CAT CTC AGA GTC CTG-3′ (antisense). The oligonucleotides used for PU.1 EMSA were as follows: PU.1 box 1 WT, 5′-AGG CAT TCT TGA GGA AGG CAG AGA TTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAA TCT CTG CCT TCC TCA AGA ATG CCT-3′ (antisense); PU.1 box 1 mut, 5′-AGG CAT TCT TGA TTA AGG CAG AGA TTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAA TCT CTG CCT TAA TCA AGA ATG CCT-3′ (antisense); PU.1 box 2 WT, 5′-GTT GTT GTT GTT TTC CTC TTT TCC ATT TTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAA AAT GGA AAA GAG GAA AAC AAC AAC AAC-3′ (antisense); PU.1 box 2 mut, 5′-GTT GTT GTT GTT TTA ATC TTT TCC ATT TTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAA AAT GGA AAA GAT TAA AAC AAC AAC AAC-3′ (antisense); PU.1 box 3 WT, 5′-TCC ATT TTT CTT CCT CCC ACC TGC CCC TTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAA GGG GCA GGT GGG AGG AAG AAA AAT GGA-3′ (antisense); PU.1 box 3 mut, 5′-TCC ATT TTT CTT AAT CCC ACC TGC CCC TTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAA GGG GCA GGT GGG ATT AAG AAA AAT GGA-3′ (antisense). OSCAR mRNA Level Is Decreased in MITFmi/mi Osteoclasts—MITF, a member of helix-loop-helix transcription factor family, is abundantly expressed in osteoclasts and can bind to the E-box consensus sequence (CA(C/T)(G/A)TG). Recently, it has been shown that MITF regulates TRAP and cathepsin K expression in osteoclasts (23Motyckova G. Weilbaecher K.N. Horstmann M. Rieman D.J. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5798-5803Google Scholar, 27Luchin A. Suchting S. Merson T. Rosol T.J. Hume D.A. Cassady A.I. Ostrowski M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36703-36710Google Scholar). To examine OSCAR expression in MITF mutant osteoclasts, mouse osteoclasts were prepared from wild type and MITFmi/mi mutant mice. In the wild type culture, giant TRAP(+) multinuclear cells were detected after 7 days of incubation with M-CSF, TRANCE, and prostaglandin E2. In the MITFmi/mi mutant culture, TRAP activity was much weaker, and TRAP (+) multinuclear cells were much smaller, with only a few nuclei at day 7 (data not shown). Consistently, TRAP, cathepsin K, and OSCAR expression were significantly reduced in MITFmi/mi osteoclasts (Fig. 1). There Are Two E-boxes, the Consensus Binding Sites for a Transcription Factor MITF, and Three PU.1 Boxes, the Consensus Binding Sites for PU.1, in the OSCAR Promoter—Examination of the 1.7-kb mouse OSCAR promoter region revealed that there were no TATA or CAAT box consensus sequences located in the 5′ upstream region of the transcriptional start site. However, there were two potential E-box elements at –929 and –6 and three putative PU.1 recognition sites at –1472, –256, and –237 of the 1.7-kb mouse OSCAR promoter fragment (Fig. 2). OSCAR Is a Target of the MITF Transcription Factor—To examine whether MITF can directly regulate OSCAR expression in osteoclasts, we used a reporter assay involving transient transfections into 293T cells. The 1.7-kb OSCAR promoter region, including the transcription initiation site, was constructed in the pGL2 basic luciferase vector. This pGL2 OSCAR 1.7 plasmid was co-transfected with various amounts of wild type MITF or MITF-mi/mi mutant-type plasmid. As shown in Fig. 3A, the luciferase activity was increased in a dose-dependent manner by MITF-WT but not by MITF-mi/mi. Because MITF expression increased the OSCAR gene promoter activity, we further examined which of the two E-boxes is critical for MITF binding. To address this question, various deletion plasmids were constructed and transfected into 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, luciferase activities were significantly decreased in the pGL2 OSCAR 0.1 (+2 to +68), and the pGL2 OSCAR 1.0 (–906 to + 68; E-box 2) constructs were compared with the pGL2 OSCAR 1.7 construct (–1626 to +68; E-box 1 and E-box 2). Next, using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated constructs with point mutations within each single and one double E-box of the 1.7-kb OSCAR promoter fragment. As shown in Fig. 3C, all types of E-box mutations significantly decreased the luciferase activity in the presence of MITF. To further confirm whether MITF directly binds to these E-boxes, EMSA was performed. Endogenous MITF from nuclear extract of cultured wild-type mouse osteoclasts was found to bind to E-box 1 and 2. The specificity of this binding was confirmed by competition studies using cold wild- and mutant-type competitor probes (Fig. 4, A and B). These results suggest that OSCAR is a target of the transcription factor MITF.Fig. 4Sequence-specific binding of two E-boxes by MITF. Nuclear extracts were prepared from wild-type MITF osteoclast cells as previously described. DNA fragments spanning each of the two E-boxes in the mouse OSCAR promoter were used as probes for EMSA (A, E-box 1; B, E-box 2). Specific binding was determined by cold competition using unlabeled wild- or mutant-type probes at 1-, 10-, and 50-fold molar excess concentrations. Results are representative of at least two independent sets of similar experiments (A and B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) OSCAR Is Also a Target of Transcription Factor PU.1— Recently, it has been reported that genetic and physical interactions between MITF and PU.1 are necessary for osteoclast gene expression and differentiation (22Luchin A. Purdom G. Murphy K. Clark M.Y. Angel N. Cassady A.I. Hume D.A. Ostrowski M.C. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 451-460Google Scholar). Furthermore, there are three PU.1 binding sites in the OSCAR 1.7-kb promoter region. Therefore, we examined the effect of the PU.1 transcription factor on OSCAR gene expression. Luciferase activity was increased in a dose-dependent manner by the PU.1 expression plasmid (Fig. 5A). Because PU.1 also increased the OSCAR gene promoter activity, we further examined which potential binding site is important in these promoter activations. To address this question, various constructs containing PU.1 box point mutations (Fig. 5B) were constructed and transfected into 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, all types of PU.1 binding site mutants except the PU.1 box 1 mutant showed significant decreases in the luciferase activity in the presence of the PU.1. To further confirm whether PU.1 directly binds to its recognition sites, EMSA was performed. The purified GST-PU.1 protein was found to bind to PU.1 recognition sites 2 and 3. Specificity of this binding was confirmed by competition studies using cold wild- and mutant-type competitor probes (Fig. 5, D and E). However, GST-PU.1 protein could not specifically bind to PU.1 recognition site 1 (Fig. 5C). This result is consistent with the inability of mutant PU.1 box 1 to decrease OSCAR gene promoter activity (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these results suggest that OSCAR is also a target of the transcription factor PU.1. The Combination of MITF and PU.1 Synergistically Activated the OSCAR Promoter—Next, we examined whether the combination of MITF and PU.1 could synergistically activate the OSCAR promoter in transient transfection assays. As shown in Fig. 6A, the MITF expression vector alone activated the OSCAR reporter 5.5-fold, but the combination of 250 ng of wild type MITF and various doses of PU.1 synergistically activated the OSCAR reporter activity up to 110-fold in a PU.1 dose-dependent manner. Co-tansfection of MITF-mi/mi with wild type PU.1 did not induce synergistic activation. These results suggest that functional binding of MITF to its recognition site in combination with PU.1 is important to elicit synergistic activation of the OSCAR gene. To determine whether synergistic activation of the OSCAR promoter by MITF and PU.1 depends on their binding sites, we examined the effect of various E-box or PU.1 box mutants. OSCAR promoter activation was not affected in the E-box 1 single mutant but was completely blocked in both E-box 2 single and E-box 1, 2 double mutants (Fig. 6B). Mutations in the PU.1 binding sites also hampered the synergistic activation of the OSCAR promoter by MITF and PU.1. However, as shown in Fig. 6C, the synergistic activation of the OSCAR promoter by MITF and PU.1 was not completely abolished even in a triple PU.1 binding site mutant, although PU.1 cannot bind. These results indicate that the MITF binding sites, especially E-box 2, but not the PU.1 binding sites are essential for synergistic transactivation of the OSCAR promoter by MITF and PU.1. The Combination of MITF and Constitutively Active MKK6 Synergistically Activated the OSCAR Promoter—TRANCE has previously been shown to activate multiple signaling pathways including NF-κB, AP-1, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and Akt via recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor molecules, which are associated with TRANCE receptor (also known as receptor activator of NF-κB, or RANK) (30Wong B.R.

https://openalex.org/W2132754338,"Replication protein-A (RPA) is involved in many processes of DNA metabolism, including DNA replication, repair, and recombination. Cells carrying a mutation in the largest subunit of RPA (rfa1-t11: K45E) have defects in meiotic recombination, mating-type switching, and survival after DNA damage caused by UV and methyl methanesulfonate, as well as increased genome instability; however, this mutant has no significant defect in DNA replication. We purified the RPA heterotrimer containing the rfa1-t11 substitution (RPA(rfa1-t11)). This mutant RPA binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with the same site size, and the RPA(rfa1-t11)·ssDNA complex shows a similar sensitivity to disruption by salt as the wild-type RPA·ssDNA complex. RPA(rfa1-t11) stimulates DNA strand exchange, provided that the Rad51 protein·ssDNA nucleoprotein complex is assembled prior to introduction of the mutant RPA. However, RPA(rfa1-t11) is displaced from ssDNA by Rad51 protein more slowly than wild-type RPA and, as a consequence, Rad51 protein-mediated DNA strand exchange is inhibited when the ssDNA is in a complex with RPA(rfa1-t11). Rad52 protein can stimulate displacement of RPA(rfa1-t11) from ssDNA by Rad51 protein, but the rate of displacement remains slow compared with wild-type RPA. These in vitro results suggest that, in vivo, RPA is bound to ssDNA prior to Rad51 protein and that RPA displacement by Rad51 protein is a critical step in homologous recombination, which is impaired in the rfa1-t11 mutation.

Homologous recombination is necessary for the repair of broken chromosomes, maintenance of genome integrity, and production of genome diversity in all organisms. The double strand break (DSB) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; RPA, replication protein-A; SSA, single-strand annealing; BIR, break-induced replication; MMS, methyl methanesulfonate; ϵDNA, etheno DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; SSB, single-stranded DNA binding protein. repair model (1Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Stahl F.W. Cell. 1983; 33: 25-35Google Scholar, 2Sun H. Treco D. Szostak J.W. Cell. 1991; 64: 1155-1161Google Scholar) provides a prototypic molecular mechanism for homologous recombination. It consists of 1) introduction of the DSB, 2) processing of the DSB to produce tailed DNA with 3′-ssDNA overhang, 3) invasion of one ssDNA end into homologous dsDNA, 4) subsequent invasion or annealing of the other processed end, 5) DNA synthesis and ligation to form double Holliday junctions, and 6) branch migration and resolution of the double Holliday junctions (for review, see Ref. 3Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Google Scholar). For one of these steps, namely, invasion of the 3′-ssDNA tail into homologous dsDNA, a nucleoprotein complex comprising the DNA strand exchange protein and ssDNA (referred to as the presynaptic complex) is required. In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, at least five proteins are involved in the formation of the presynaptic complex: Rad51, Rad52, Rad55, and Rad57 proteins and replication protein-A (RPA) (for review, see Ref. 4Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Google Scholar). Rad51 protein, a yeast homologue of Escherichia coli RecA protein, catalyzes DNA strand exchange in the presence of ATP (5Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Google Scholar, 6Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Google Scholar). RPA is the ssDNA-binding protein of eukaryotes (7Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Google Scholar, 8Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have suggested that there are two possible paths for formation of the presynaptic complex (Fig. 1). When Rad51 protein is allowed to bind the ssDNA produced by resection of the DSB prior to RPA, it binds to both ssDNA and DNA secondary structure, because Rad51 protein binds dsDNA as effectively as ssDNA (9Sung P. Robberson D.L. Cell. 1995; 82: 453-461Google Scholar, 10Namsaraev E.A. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6177-6182Google Scholar, 11Zaitseva E.M. Zaitsev E.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2907-2915Google Scholar). Such binding prevents it from forming a uniform presynaptic complex. In this pathway, RPA facilitates presynaptic complex formation by removing DNA secondary structure (6Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Google Scholar), due to its helix-destabilizing activity (12Treuner K. Ramsperger U. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 104-112Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, left). Assembly of a functional presynaptic filament proceeds very rapidly and, in this report, this pathway is referred to as the “Rad51-first” pathway. In the second pathway, RPA binds the ssDNA prior to Rad51 protein, and then Rad51 protein displaces RPA to form a uniform Rad51 nucleoprotein complex (Fig. 1, right). In this report, this pathway is referred to as the “RPA-first” pathway. Due to the high affinity of RPA for ssDNA (7Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Google Scholar), the displacement of RPA by Rad51 protein is slow (13New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Google Scholar) and, hence, DNA strand exchange is also slow. Rad52 protein accelerates the displacement of RPA for Rad51 protein and, thereby, facilitates the rate of presynaptic complex formation, which, in turn, accelerates DNA strand exchange (13New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Google Scholar, 14Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Google Scholar, 15Shinohara A. Ogawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 404-407Google Scholar). This activity of Rad52 protein is called its recombination mediator activity (14Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Google Scholar, 16Beernink H.T. Morrical S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 385-389Google Scholar). The Rad55-Rad57 heterodimer also acts as a recombination mediator (17Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Google Scholar). Stimulation of Rad51 protein-mediated DNA strand exchange by Rad52 protein is species-specific: the E. coli nor human counterparts can substitute for the yeast proteins (13New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Google Scholar). Therefore, it is believed that species-specific interactions between RPA and Rad52 protein, and between Rad52 and Rad51 proteins facilitate nucleation of Rad51 protein onto the RPA-complexed ssDNA (18Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31663-31672Google Scholar). Furthermore, cytological analysis of meiotic chromosomes showed that RPA and Rad52 protein colocalize extensively and that Rad52 protein is necessary for Rad51 foci formation (19Gasior S.L. Wong A.K. Kora Y. Shinohara A. Bishop D.K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2208-2221Google Scholar). Based on the above observations, it was suggested that “RPA-first” is the in vivo pathway for presynaptic complex formation. In addition to its recombination mediator activity, Rad52 protein also has DNA-annealing activity (20Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Google Scholar). Rad52 protein can anneal both free ssDNA and ssDNA that is complexed with its cognate RPA (21Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Google Scholar, 22Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Google Scholar). The annealing activity of Rad52 protein is very important, because an annealing step is crucial for many recombination pathways in which RAD52 is required (3Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Google Scholar). Annealing can follow the DNA strand invasion step of DSBR (23Kantake N. Madiraju M.V.V.M. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15327-15332Google Scholar), and it is essential for both single-strand annealing (SSA) (24Sugawara N. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 563-575Google Scholar, 25Fishman-Lobell J.

A. 1996; 93: 7131-7136Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 3Pâques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Google Scholar). In SSA, a DSB between tandem repeat sequence is processed so that complementary sequences are exposed and annealed; in BIR, strand invasion is believed to be mediated by annealing activity of Rad52 protein, then the invading strand can serve as a primer for DNA replication. RPA consists of three subunits, RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3, with approximate molecular masses of 70,000, 32,000, and 14,000 Da, respectively (7Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Google Scholar, 8Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Google Scholar). Among them, the largest subunit is the most studied. RPA1 has three major domains: an N-terminal domain involved in DNA polymerase α stimulation (27Dornreiter I. Erdile L.F. Gilbert I.U. von Winkler D. Kelly T.J. Fanning E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 769-776Google Scholar), two ssDNA-binding domains in the middle of the protein (28Philipova D. Mullen J.R. Maniar H.S. Lu J. Gu C. Brill S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2222-2233Google Scholar), and a C-terminal domain with a putative zinc finger involved in subunit interaction and ssDNA binding (29Gomes X.V. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4534-4543Google Scholar, 30Brill S.J. Bastin-Shanower S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7225-7234Google Scholar, 31Lin Y.L. Shivji M.K. Chen C. Kolodner R. Wood R.D. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1453-1461Google Scholar). RPA1 is phosphorylated in a DNA damage-induced manner (32Brush G.S. Kelly T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3725-3732Google Scholar). In addition to its ssDNA-binding activity, RPA interacts with many proteins, including DNA polymerase α, XPA, p53, and Rad52 protein (for review, see Refs. 7Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Google Scholar and 8Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Google Scholar). In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, RPA1 is encoded by the RFA1 gene (33Heyer W.-D. Rao M.R.S. Erdile L.F. Kelly T.J. Kolodner R.D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2321-2329Google Scholar, 34Brill S.J. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1589-1600Google Scholar). Genetic analysis showed that RFA1 belongs to the RAD52 epistasis group of recombinational repair genes (35Firmenich A.A. Elias-Arnanz M. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1620-1631Google Scholar, 36Hays S.L. Firmenich A.A. Massey P. Banerjee R. Berg P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4400-4406Google Scholar). Umezu et al. (37Umezu K. Sugawara N. Chen C. Haber J.E. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 989-1005Google Scholar) systematically isolated 21 rfa1 mutants: five of them were temperature-sensitive for growth, and 19 of them (including some temperature-sensitive mutants) were sensitive to UV and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). A subset of the 21 mutants also shows increased genome instability (38Chen C. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 9-22Google Scholar). One of the mutants is rfa1-t11 (K45E); the rfa1-t11 mutant is about 1000-fold more sensitive to both UV and MMS than wild-type. Its defects in mating-type switching, the single-strand annealing (SSA) pathway of DSB repair (37Umezu K. Sugawara N. Chen C. Haber J.E. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 989-1005Google Scholar), and meiotic recombination (39Soustelle C. Vedel M. Kolodner R. Nicolas A. Genetics. 2002; 161: 535-547Google Scholar) indicate that the rfa1-t11 mutant is recombination-defective. The rfa1-t11 mutation also rescues the “terminal arrest” phenotype of Δyku70 cells and Δtid1 cells in the presence of irreparable DSB (40Lee S.E. Moore J.K. Holmes A. Umezu K. Kolodner R.D. Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 94: 399-409Google Scholar, 41Lee S.E. Pellicioli A. Malkova A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1053-1057Google Scholar). Despite severe defects in DNA recombination and repair, the rfa1-t11 mutant shows limited deficiency, if any, in DNA replication, suggesting that the rfa1-t11 mutation affects only the recombination and repair functions of RPA. In this report, we show the biochemical properties of the RPA heterotrimer containing the rfa1-t11 mutation (RPA(rfa1-t11)). RPA(rfa1-t11) binds ssDNA as efficiently as wild-type RPA and stimulates presynaptic complex formation when added to preformed Rad51 protein·ssDNA complexes. However, RPA(rfa1-t11) is defective in presynaptic complex formation when RPA and ssDNA are complexed prior to addition of Rad51 protein. These results provide additional evidence that presynaptic complex formation occurs by the prior binding of RPA to the processed DSB and that failure by Rad51 protein to displace the bound RPA results in recombination deficiency. DNA and Proteins—ϕX174 ssDNA, dsDNA, restriction endonucleases, and Vent DNA polymerase were purchased from New England BioLabs. Proteinase K was purchased from Roche Applied Science. ϕX174 dsDNA was digested with PstI. Poly(dT) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The concentrations of linearized ϕX174 dsDNA, ϕX174 ssDNA, M13 ssDNA, and poly(dT) were determined using molar extinction coefficients of 6500, 8125, 8125, and 7300 m–1·cm–1, respectively, at 260 nm. Etheno DNA (ϵDNA) was prepared as described (42Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Google Scholar). The concentration of ϵDNA was determined using a Malachite green-ammonium molybdate assay (43Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Analyt. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Google Scholar). All DNA concentrations are expressed as moles of nucleotides. The plasmid for overexpression of Rfa1-t11 subunit (pYES-rfa1-t11) was constructed by cloning the PCR-amplified rfa1-t11 open reading frame into pYES2 (Invitrogen) plasmid under the GAL promoter. The sequence of the open reading frame was confirmed by the sequencing facility at University of California, Davis. Wild-type RPA was purified from BJ5464 (MATα ura3–52 trp1 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prb1Δ1.6R can1 GAL) containing three plasmids that express RPA1, RPA2, and RPA3 under control of the GAL promoter (44Nakagawa T. Flores-Rozas H. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31487-31493Google Scholar), essentially as described (45Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Google Scholar), except for the omission of Affi-Gel blue column chromatography and use of Resource Q chromatography instead of DEAE-cellulose chromatography. To overproduce RPA(rfa1-t11), BJ5464 with the genomic rfa1-t11 mutation was constructed by the “pop-in pop-out” method as described (56Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1987: 13.10.1-13.10.5Google Scholar), using pKU2 rfa1-t11 linearized by NheI (37Umezu K. Sugawara N. Chen C. Haber J.E. Kolodner R.D. Genetics. 1998; 148: 989-1005Google Scholar). The genomic DNA sequence was confirmed by sequencing of PCR-amplified rfa1-t11 fragment. RPA(rfa1-t11) was overexpressed in BJ5464 rfa1-t11 with pYES-rfa1-t11 and RPA2 and RPA3 overexpressing plasmids that were used for wild-type RPA expression. RPA(rfa1-t11) was purified by the same method used for wild-type RPA, except that the second wash in ssDNA-cellulose chromatography was done at 1 m NaCl instead of 0.75 m NaCl. Rad51 and Rad52 proteins were purified from E. coli as described (11Zaitseva E.M. Zaitsev E.N. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2907-2915Google Scholar, 13New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Google Scholar). RecA protein was purified as described (46Griffith J. Shores C.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 158-162Google Scholar). Concentrations of RPA, Rad51, Rad52, and RecA proteins were determined using extinction coefficients of 8.8 × 104, 1.29 × 104, 2.4 × 104, and 2.7 × 104m–1·cm–1, respectively, at 280 nm. ssDNA Binding Assays—Binding to ssDNA was monitored by two procedures. One took advantage of the quenching of RPA intrinsic fluorescence upon ssDNA binding, using an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 290 and 345 nm, respectively, and the excitation and emission band widths were 2 and 8 nm, respectively. The second assay measured the fluorescence change in ϵDNA fluorescence upon RPA binding, using an excitation wave-length of 300 nm and an emission wavelength of 405 nm. The reaction buffer contained 30 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 20 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) unless otherwise indicated. DNA and protein concentrations are indicated in the figure legends. To prevent binding of RPA to the cuvette surface, a methyl acrylate cuvette (Perfector Scientific) was coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) by incubating the cuvette with 4 ml of 250 μg/ml BSA (Fraction V, Sigma) for at least 20 min at room temperature, and then washed with water only and dried. DNA Strand Exchange Assays—DNA strand exchange reactions were performed as described (6Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Google Scholar, 13New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Google Scholar). Briefly, ϕX174 ssDNA, RPA, Rad51, and Rad52 proteins were mixed at 37 °C in the indicated order and time in 12.5 μl of buffer containing 42 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 3 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm NaCl, 25 μg/ml BSA, and 2.5 mm ATP. DNA strand exchange was initiated by addition of 33 μm linearized ϕX174 dsDNA and 4 mm spermidine acetate and then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Joint molecules are formed as an intermediate product, and nicked circular dsDNA is formed as a final product in this assay. The reaction mixture was deproteinized by addition of 0.67% SDS and 1.1 mg/ml of Proteinase K and incubation for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer at 40 V for 14 h, and the gel was stained in 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide in TAE buffer. Both the order of addition, and the concentration of proteins are described in the figure legends. ATP Hydrolysis Assays—The ATPase activity of Rad51 and RecA proteins was measured in 120 μl of buffer at 37 °C essentially as described (6Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Google Scholar, 47Kreuzer K.N. Jongeneel C.V. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 144-160Google Scholar, 48Kowalczykowski S.C. Krupp R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 97-113Google Scholar). Both the order of addition, and the concentration of DNA and proteins are described in the figure legends. For reactions with Rad51 protein, the buffer contained 30 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm ATP, 0.3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 512 μm reduced form β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), 50 μg/ml BSA, 10 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 10 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. For reactions with RecA protein, the buffer contained 30 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm ATP, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 512 μm NADH, 50 μg/ml BSA, 15 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 15 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. In this assay system, ATP hydrolysis is coupled to the oxidation of NADH; therefore, ATP hydrolysis is monitored as decrease of absorbance at 340 nm. Absorbance at 340 nm was monitored using an HP 8452A spectrophotometer. The ATP hydrolysis rate (micromolar/min) was calculated by the following formula: rate of A340 decrease × 9880. The amount of ATP hydrolyzed (micromolar) was calculated by A340 decrease × 6.22 × 10–3. Complementary ssDNA Annealing Assays—Annealing of RPA·ssDNA complexes by Rad52 protein was performed as described (21Sugiyama T. New J.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Google Scholar). Briefly, heat-denatured pBluescript II SK– (Stratagene) linearized by PstI (600 nm) and various concentrations of RPA were incubated at 30 °C in buffer (400 μl) containing 30 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 μm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Rad52 protein (75 nm) was added to start annealing. The fluorescence of 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole was monitored using an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 345 and 467 nm, and bandwidths of 2 and 8 nm, respectively. RPA(rfa1-t11) Has ssDNA-binding Properties That Are Similar to Wild-type RPA—To understand the nature of rfa1-t11 mutation, we purified the RPA heterotrimer containing the rfa1-t11 (K45E) mutation to homogeneity (data not shown). We designate the mutant RPA heterotrimer as RPA(rfa1-t11). First, we compared the ssDNA-binding activities of wild-type RPA and RPA(rfa1-t11). To determine the occluded binding site size of RPA(rfa1-t11), two different fluorometric methods were employed. One method was to monitor the intrinsic fluorescence of RPA (Fig. 2A); the intrinsic fluorescence of RPA is quenched up to 40% when bound to ssDNA (49Sibenaller Z.A. Sorensen B.R. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12496-12506Google Scholar). Therefore, as RPA or RPA(rfa1-t11) is added in to a fixed amount of ssDNA under stoichiometric binding conditions, the fluorescence increase per amount of protein added remains low until ssDNA is saturated; at that point, the slope of the titration curve changes. Using this method, the occluded binding site size of both wild-type RPA and RPA(rfa1-t11) was determined to be 26 nucleotides. The second method used to measure ssDNA binding was to monitor changes in the fluorescence of etheno DNA (ϵDNA) upon RPA binding (42Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Google Scholar). ϵDNA contains ethenoadenosine and ethenocytosine residues made by modification with chloroacetaldehyde; ethenoadenosine has strong fluorescence at 405 nm when excited at 300 nm. The fluorescence of ϵDNA increases up to 4-fold when RPA is bound to it (45Alani E. Thresher R. Griffith J.D. Kolodner R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 54-71Google Scholar). Using this method, we determined the protein to DNA ratio at which DNA binding was saturated for both wild-type RPA and RPA(rfa1-t11) (Fig. 2B). In agreement with the results of the intrinsic protein fluorescence quenching experiments, the ϵDNA results show that both wild-type RPA and RPA(rfa1-t11) have the same occluded site size of ∼26 nucleotides per RPA heterotrimer. To determine the relative binding affinity of the two RPA proteins, the stability of the protein·DNA complexes to disruption by salt was compared at various sodium chloride and magnesium acetate concentrations. When the sodium chloride concentration was varied (Fig. 2C), RPA(rfa1-t11) showed a slightly greater resistance to NaCl concentration than wild-type; the midpoint for dissociation was 635 ± 25 mm sodium chloride for RPA(rfa1-t11), and 575 ± 15 mm sodium chloride for wild-type RPA. Fig. 2D shows the sensitivity of ssDNA binding of RPA to various magnesium acetate concentrations. The midpoint for dissociation of both wild-type and RPA(rfa1-t11) heterotrimers was ∼145 ± 10 mm magnesium acetate, indicating that RPA(rfa1-t11) is as sensitive to the disruption by magnesium acetate as wild-type RPA. The ssDNA binding experiments indicate that RPA(rfa1-t11) has an ssDNA-binding activity that is similar to, or even slightly greater than, wild-type RPA. Subsequent Introduction of RPA(rfa1-t11) Stimulates Presynaptic Complex Formation by Rad51 Protein—RPA stimulates presynaptic complex formation by Rad51 protein when Rad51 protein is first assembled on ssDNA (see Fig. 1, Rad51-first) (5Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Google Scholar, 6Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Google Scholar). Because E. coli SSB protein can substitute for RPA in this activity (6Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Google Scholar), it is inferred that only ssDNA-binding activity, and not species-specific protein interaction, is required for this stimulation (which is not the case for Rad52-stimulated reactions (13New J.H. Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 407-410Google Scholar)). Thus, stimulation results from removal of DNA secondary structure, allowing Rad51 protein to form a uniform presynaptic complex. Because RPA(rfa1-t11) binds ssDNA at least as efficiently as wild-type RPA, we expected that RPA(rfa1-t11) should stimulate presynaptic complex formation and DNA strand exchange by Rad51 protein as effectively as wild-type RPA. To monitor presynaptic complex formation by Rad51 protein and ssDNA directly, the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of Rad51 protein was monitored (Fig. 3A). ATP hydrolysis by Rad51 protein reflects formation of an ssDNA-Rad51 complex and, thus, presynaptic complex formation. RPA (or E. coli SSB protein) stimulates the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of Rad51 protein when Rad51 protein and ssDNA containing secondary structure are mixed prior to addition of RPA (6Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Google Scholar). Rad51 protein was first incubated with ssDNA, then various amounts of either wild-type or RPA(rfa1-t11) was added: the ATPase activity of Rad51 protein was stimulated to the same extent by either RPA. Optimum stimulation was achieved at about 50 nm RPA, corresponding to 100 nucleotides of ssDNA per one RPA heterotrimer. This result is consistent with previous observations (6Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that RPA(rfa1-t11) is as good as wild-type RPA in stimulation of presynaptic complex formation when ssDNA and Rad51 protein are complexed before the addition of RPA. RPA(rfa1-t11) Stimulates DNA Strand Exchange by Rad51 Protein When Added Subsequent to Rad51·ssDNA Complex Formation—In addition to presynaptic complex formation, in the bacterial system, SSB protein has another role in DNA strand exchange; it binds to the displaced strand so that reinvasion is prevented. This function of SSB protein is its post-synaptic role (50Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9315-9320Google Scholar). A post-synaptic function for RPA in Rad51 protein-mediated DNA strand exchange was also reported recently (51Eggler A.L. Inman R.B. Cox M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39280-39288Google Scholar). To analyze both presynaptic and post-synaptic capabilities of RPA(rfa1-t11), we examined DNA strand exchange in the presence of RPA(rfa1-t11). Fig. 3B illustrates the DNA strand exchange assay: the circular ssDNA·Rad51 protein complex pairs with homologous linear dsDNA, and strands are exchanged to form an intermediate called the joint molecule; completion of DNA strand exchange results in nicked circular dsDNA and linear ssDNA products. First, we tested if RPA(rfa1-t11) stimulated DNA strand exchange when Rad51 protein was incubated with ssDNA before addition of RPA. Both wild-type RPA and RPA(rfa1-t11) stimulated product formation (Fig. 3C); there was no significant difference between wild-type RPA and RPA(rfa1-t11). For both proteins, optimal DNA strand exchange occurred at 1.65 μm RPA, which translates into 20 nucleotides of ssDNA per RPA heterotrimer. More RPA (wild-type or mutant) is needed for DNA strand exchange than for stimulation of presynaptic complex formation, as analyzed by ATPase assays, a result that is consistent with previous observations (6Sugiyama T. Zaitseva E.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7940-7945Google Scholar). This difference results from the facts that a stoichiometric amount of RPA is needed in its post-synaptic role to bind the displaced strand to prevent re-invasion of the displaced strand, whereas a less than stoichiometric amount of RPA is needed in its presynaptic role to remove the limited amount of DNA secondary structure. Excess RPA(rfa1-t11) Inhibits DNA Strand Exchange When Bound to ssDNA before Rad51 Protein—RPA inhibits DNA strand exc"
https://openalex.org/W2050591157,"Factor IX is an indispensable protein required in the blood coagulation cascade. It binds to the surface of phospholipid membrane by means of a γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain situated at the N terminus. Recently, we showed that physiological concentrations of Mg2+ ions affect the native conformation of the Gla domain and in doing so augment the biological activity of factor IXa and binding affinity with its binding protein even in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Here we report on the crystal structures of the Mg2+/Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-bound (Mg2+-free) factor IX Gla domain (IXGD1–46) in complex with its binding protein (IX-bp) at 1.55 and 1.80 Å resolutions, respectively. Three Mg2+ and five Ca2+ ions were bound in the Mg2+/Ca2+-bound IXGD1–46, and the Mg2+ ions were replaced by Ca2+ ions in Mg2+-free IXGD1–46. Comparison of Mg2+/Ca2+-bound with Ca2+-bound structures of the complexes showed that Mg2+ ion, which formed a bridge between IXGD1–46 and IX-bp, forced IXGD1–46 to rotate 4° relative to IX-bp and hence might be the cause of a more tight interaction between the molecules than in the case of the Mg2+-free structure. The results clearly suggest that Mg2+ ions are required to maintain native conformation and in vivo function of factor IX Gla domain during blood coagulation.

The results clearly suggest that Mg2+ ions are required to maintain native conformation and in vivo function of factor IX Gla domain during blood coagulation. Factor IX is a pivotal participant in the early stages of the blood coagulation cascade. Its deficiency leads to hemophilia B, which is characterized by severe bleeding (1Thompson A.R. Blood. 1986; 67: 565-572Google Scholar). Factor IX binds to phospholipid membrane by means of a γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) 1The abbreviations used are: Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; IXGD1–46, factor IX Gla domain-containing peptide 1–46; XGD1–44, factor X Gla domain-containing peptide 1–44; IX-bp, factor IX-binding protein; IX/X-bp, factor IX/X-binding protein; X-bp, factor X-binding protein; TF, tissue factor. 1The abbreviations used are: Gla, γ-carboxyglutamic acid; IXGD1–46, factor IX Gla domain-containing peptide 1–46; XGD1–44, factor X Gla domain-containing peptide 1–44; IX-bp, factor IX-binding protein; IX/X-bp, factor IX/X-binding protein; X-bp, factor X-binding protein; TF, tissue factor. domain located at its N terminus, which is also found in other vitamin K-dependent proteins such as factors VII and X and prothrombin. A Gla domain consists of 10–13 γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues and requires Ca2+ ions for stabilization of the active conformation for membrane binding (2Stenflo J. Ferlund P. Egan W. Roepstorff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2730-2733Google Scholar, 3Nelsestuen G.L. Zytkovicz T.H. Howard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6347-6350Google Scholar, 4Nelsestuen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5648-5656Google Scholar). The enzymatically activated factor IX, factor IXa, forms a complex with factor VIIIa, which in turn activates factor X to form factor Xa. These enzymatic reactions eventually lead to fibrin clot formation. In the classical cascade model of coagulation, factors VIII and IX are classified as components of the “intrinsic pathway” and are placed downstream from factor XI (5Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Google Scholar, 6Furie B. Furie B.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 800-806Google Scholar). Today, however, a sole mechanism, the so-called “extrinsic pathway” is said to govern blood coagulation, which starts with the exposure of tissue factor (TF), an extravascular component, to the bloodstream and the formation of the active factor VIIa/TF complex. It has been shown previously that activation of factor X by the factor IXa/factor VIIIa complex is ∼50-fold more efficient than activation by the factor VIIa/TF complex (7Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Google Scholar), even though factor X had been thought to be activated directly mainly by factor VIIa/TF. Komiyama et al. (8Komiyama Y. Pedersen A.H. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9418-9425Google Scholar) showed that factor IX is preferred over factor X as a substrate of factor VIIa/TF. Further, Mann and co-workers (7Lawson J.H. Kalafatis M. Stram S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23357-23366Google Scholar, 9Jones K.C. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23367-23373Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the factor VIIa/TF-induced generation of thrombin is strongly dependent on factor VIII. These studies have clearly demonstrated that factors VIII and IX are required for the chain reaction to proceed by the extrinsic pathway. Recently, we showed that the Ca2+-dependent activation of factor IX by the factor VIIa/TF complex is accelerated by Mg2+ ions (10Sekiya F. Yoshida M. Yamashita T. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8541-8544Google Scholar), as well as by factor XIa (11Sekiya F. Yamashita T. Atoda H. Komiyama Y. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14325-14331Google Scholar), and that Mg2+ ions also accelerate the activation of factor X by the factor IXa/factor VIIIa complex (10Sekiya F. Yoshida M. Yamashita T. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8541-8544Google Scholar). Such acceleration by Mg2+ ions has been observed only in the case of the reactions involving factors IX and IXa. In blood plasma, magnesium is present in relatively high concentrations (0.8–1.2 mm; 0.4–0.6 mm as free ions) as is also calcium (2.2–2.6 mm; 1.1–1.3 mm as free ions) (12Paterson C.R. Essentials of Human Biochemistry. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, UK1983: 237-248Google Scholar). Because of its abundance, we hypothesized that Mg2+ ions might play a significant role in blood coagulation, such as in augmenting the activity of factor IXa. Based on known facts, a model illustrating the main elements of the principal chain reaction has been proposed (10Sekiya F. Yoshida M. Yamashita T. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8541-8544Google Scholar). In addition to the acceleration in activity by Mg2+ ions, folding of the native tertiary structure of factor IX Gla domain appears to require not only Ca2+ but Mg2+ ions (11Sekiya F. Yamashita T. Atoda H. Komiyama Y. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14325-14331Google Scholar, 13Sekiya F. Yoshida M. Yamashita T. Morita T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 205-208Google Scholar). Snake venom obtained from Trimeresurus flavoviridis contains a protein that can bind to either factor IX or factor X and is called a factor IX/factor X-binding protein (IX/X-bp) (14Atoda H. Morita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 808-813Google Scholar, 15Atoda H. Hyuga M. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14903-14911Google Scholar). The affinity of IX/X-bp for factor IX Gla domain is significantly increased above that of Ca2+ ions by Mg2+ ions (11Sekiya F. Yamashita T. Atoda H. Komiyama Y. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14325-14331Google Scholar). Metal ion-induced intrinsic fluorescence quenching studies also indicate that the factor IX Gla domain has specific Mg2+ ion-binding site(s) and that the binding of Mg2+ ions promotes further conformational changes in the Ca2+-bound molecule (13Sekiya F. Yoshida M. Yamashita T. Morita T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 205-208Google Scholar) enhancing the ability of the protein to function. At present, a total of seven Ca2+-bridging sites have been identified within the Ca2+-prothrombin fragment-1 (16Soriano-Garcia M. Park C.H. Tulinsky A. Ravichandran K.G. Skrzypczak-Jankun E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6805-6810Google Scholar) and in the Gla domain of factor VIIa (17Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chene C. Winkler F.K. Guha A. Konigsberg W.H. Nemerson Y. Kirchhofer D. Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Google Scholar). A recent crystallographic study of the complex between factor X Gla domain-containing peptide 1–44 (XGD1–44) and snake venom factor X-binding protein (X-bp) has revealed an eighth Ca2+-binding site in the Gla domain of factor X (18Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Atoda H. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7230-7234Google Scholar). Even though the structures of the Ca2+ ion-bound (19Freedman S.J. Furie B.C. Furie B. Baleja J.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12126-12137Google Scholar) and Mg2+ ion-bound (20Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16227-16236Google Scholar) factor IX Gla domain peptides (residues 1–47) have been investigated by NMR, the coordination sites of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions are not known, especially when both ions are present. Here, we report on the states of Mg2+ ions in the crystal structure of factor IX Gla domain 1–46, complexed with its binding protein in the presence of Mg2+/Ca2+ and Ca2+ ions. Interpretation of the data supports a role for Mg2+ ions in the blood coagulation scheme presented before, whereby the biological activity of factor IXa is enhanced. Protein Purification—Factor IX was purified from frozen bovine plasma following standard protocols (21Hashimoto N. Morita T. Iwanaga S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1347-1355Google Scholar). Gla domain peptide (residues 1–46, IXGD1–46) was prepared as described (13Sekiya F. Yoshida M. Yamashita T. Morita T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 205-208Google Scholar). IX-bp was purified from the venom of T. flavoviridis as previously reported (22Atoda H. Ishikawa M. Yoshihara E. Sekiya F. Morita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 965-973Google Scholar). Purified IXGD1–46 and IX-bp were mixed, and the proteins in the mixture were complexed by the addition of MgCl2 and CaCl2 solutions to a final concentration of 1 mm MgCl2 and3mm CaCl2, respectively. The mixture of IXGD1–46 and IX-bp was loaded onto a Pharmacia Superdex75 column (1.6 × 60 cm), pre-equilibrated with 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 3 mm CaCl2, and eluted. The IXGD1–46/IX-bp complex was characterized by a peak that moved faster than the IX-bp peak. To obtain a Mg2+-free complex, Mg2+ salts were omitted in all procedures. The pooled fractions containing the complex were concentrated to ∼5 mg/ml before use. Crystallization and Data Collection—Both the Mg2+-containing and Mg2+-free complexes were crystallized by the microbatch method from a 2-μl solution consisting of 1 μl of 5 mg/ml protein and 1 μl of precipitant (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 14% PEG 6000, 5 mm CaCl2,in the presence or absence of 2 mm MgCl2) at 20 °C. Crystals having approximate dimensions of 0.3 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm were harvested into a cryoprotectant that contained 30% glycerol in the precipitant and flash frozen in a stream of N2 gas at 100 K. Diffraction data were collected on a MAR CCD detector using synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.72 Å) at Beamline 41XU of SPring-8. Data reduction was performed using a HKL2000 package. Phasing and Refinement—The structures of the IXGD1–46/IX-bp complex were solved by the molecular replacement method using the XGD1–44/X-bp complex structure (18Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Atoda H. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7230-7234Google Scholar) with the programs AMoRe (23Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) and ARP/wARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Google Scholar). Manual model fitting was done with QUANTA (Molecular Simulations, Waltham, MA), and the structures were refined using program CNS (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) after removing 10% of the measurements for monitoring of the Rfree factor. In the early stages of model fitting, Ca2+ ions were assigned to all-cation-binding sites. In the Mg2+-bound complex, after several cycles of refinement and map inspection, Mg2+ ions and Ca2+ ions were easily distinguishable because of 1) B-factors that calculated Mg2+ ions as Ca2+ ions, 2) differences in the shapes and numbers of coordinated oxygen atoms, 3) electron density height and radius on the map, and 4) distances from coordinated oxygen atoms. Considering these different factors, Mg2+ ions, instead of Ca2+ ions, were assigned to sites Ca-1, Ca-7, and Ca-8. The difference in the distances between Mg2+–O and Ca2+–O, calculated from average distances, was 0.295 Å. This is in good agreement with the published value of 0.28 Å (26Harding M.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 401-411Google Scholar). The results of the refinement are summarized in Table I. All of the figures were produced with MOLSCRIPT (27Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar) and Raster3D (28Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J.

The Gla residues are in red, and membrane residues are shown in yellow at the putative insertion site (20Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol.

C, same view of XGD 1–44 with yellow lines representing membrane surface in both models.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Three Mg2+ ions, labeled Mg-1, Mg-7, and Mg-8, were located on the surface of IXGD1–46 (Fig. 2B), corresponding to the positions of Ca-1, Ca-7, and Ca-8 in XGD1–44 (Fig. 2C) in the crystal structure of XGD1–44/X-bp complex (18Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Atoda H. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7230-7234Google Scholar). Each Mg2+ ion had a typical bipyramidal coordination geometry with a pair of Gla residues and water molecules. Fig. 3 shows a typical region containing both Mg-1 and Ca-2 for comparison. Mg-1 was also coordinated to Glu98 of the IX-bp A chain and contributed to one of the major interactions between the two molecules, as found in the case of Ca-1 in the XGD1–44/X-bp complex. In IXGD1–46, the Mg–O distances on average were 2.12 Å, whereas the Ca–O distances on average were 2.41 Å. To clarify the coordination of Mg2+ ions, attempts were made to solve the structure of the IXGD1–46/IX-bp complex by comparing the structures under Mg2+-free and Mg2+-bound conditions. Under Mg2+-free conditions, the three Mg2+ ions, Mg-1, Mg-7, and Mg-8, were replaced by Ca2+ ions. At site Mg-1, the distance from the coordinated oxygen atoms to Ca2+ ion was elongated in the Mg2+-free condition (from 2.11 to 2.34 Å), as was the distance from the other two Mg2+-binding sites. Although this difference in distance is small, the difference was enough to cause a rotation of IXGD1–46 when IX-bp was bound (see below). Structure of Factor IX-binding Protein and Induced Fitting— Comparison of the tertiary structures of IX-bp between the complexed and free forms (29Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Koizumi M. Kano H. Atoda H. Morita T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 103-112Google Scholar) showed that the general shapes were similar before and after binding with IXGD1–46. When the B chains of the complexed and free forms were superimposed, the A chain was displaced toward the concave surface by a 3° rotation around the axis (Fig. 4A), which exists approximately perpendicular to the pseudo 2-fold axis and which passes through the position of the interchain disulfide bond between Cys79 of the A chain and Cys75 of the B chain. The spatial movement of the A chain of IX-bp following binding with IXGD1–46 reached a maximum distance of 4 Å in the direction of the concave surface. Consequently, the A chain globular body shifted as interaction occurred directly with the Lys63, Thr62, and Glu108 of the IX-bp A chain and Lys22 of IXGD1–46 (Fig. 4B). As a result, the closed form that might be arising from the induced fitting most likely contributed to the tight association of the Gla domain (11Sekiya F. Yamashita T. Atoda H. Komiyama Y. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14325-14331Google Scholar). Comparison of Mg2+/Ca2+- and Ca2+-bound Form of the Complex—Previously, we reported that the addition of Mg2+ ions leads to increased affinity between the factor IX Gla domain and IX/X-bp and that this might be caused by structural changes in the Gla domain (11Sekiya F. Yamashita T. Atoda H. Komiyama Y. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14325-14331Google Scholar). To obtain a better understanding of the relationship between structural changes and incremental increase in affinity, comparisons in the structures of Mg2+-bound and Mg2+-free complexes were made. Fig. 4C shows the positions of the two IXGD1–46 molecules being significantly displaced when IX-bp of both complexes are superimposed. This situation probably arises mainly from a difference in length between O–Mg–O and O–Ca–O bridges. The C-terminal region of IXGD1–46 of the Mg2+-free complex was found to be displaced significantly from that of the Mg2+-bound complex by a rotation of 4° relative to IX-bp around an axis passing through the ion bridges area and approximately perpendicular to the plane in Fig. 4C. As a result, we believe interactions between Lys63, Thr62, and Glu108 of the IX-bp A chain and Lys22 of IXGD1–46 in the Mg2+-bound complex (Fig. 4B) were disrupted in the Mg2+-free complex. The spatial separation and loss of interaction between the IX-bp A chain and the Gla domain might be the major reason for the decrease in affinity mentioned above. In the crystal structure of factor IX Gla domain in complex with IX-bp, 1-, 7-, and 8-cation-binding sites were occupied by Mg2+ ions in the physiological range of Mg2+ and Ca2+ ion concentration. To our knowledge, this is the first report identifying the binding sites of Mg2+ ions in the Gla domain. It is known that Mg2+ ions greatly enhance the affinity between Gla domain and IX-bp (11Sekiya F. Yamashita T. Atoda H. Komiyama Y. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14325-14331Google Scholar). In this study, crystallographic evidence shows that Mg2+ bridging may play an important role in this association. Mg2+ bridging brings the two molecules closer together by 0.58 Å than does Ca2+ bridging alone. It may be assumed that negatively charged groups of IXGD1–46 insert deeply into the concave surface of IX-bp, thereby causing a tighter interaction. In addition to this association, the induced fitting may involve the interaction of subunits of IX-bp caused by rotation around the axis passing in the proximity of the interchain disulfide bond, resulting in water-mediated interactions, as well as direct interaction between a loop of the A chain and Lys22 of IXGD1–46 as mentioned above. On the other hand, in the Mg2+-free (Ca2+ only) complex, Lys22 of IXGD1–46 is too far removed to form hydrogen bonds with the side chains of IX-bp, and hence the affinity between Gla domain and IX-bp might be lower in agreement with previous findings (10Sekiya F. Yoshida M. Yamashita T. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8541-8544Google Scholar, 11Sekiya F. Yamashita T. Atoda H. Komiyama Y. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14325-14331Google Scholar). It is also known that Mg2+ ions increase the affinity between factor IXa and antibodies (11Sekiya F. Yamashita T. Atoda H. Komiyama Y. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14325-14331Google Scholar, 13Sekiya F. Yoshida M. Yamashita T. Morita T. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 205-208Google Scholar) and the biological activity of factor IXa in the presence of factor VIIIa (10Sekiya F. Yoshida M. Yamashita T. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8541-8544Google Scholar). The interaction between factors IXa and VIIIa is well documented by experiments indicating that epidermal growth factor and the serine protease domains of factor IXa were involved in the interaction with factor VIIIa (30Persson K.E. Villoutreix B.O. Thamlitz A.M. Knobe K.E. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35616-35624Google Scholar, 31Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Maki S.L. J. Biol.

Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14759-14766Google Scholar). We consider that the Gla domain also participates in the interaction with factor VIIIa via Mg2+-binding sites as follows. The data in Fig. 5 show a spatial relationship among the Gla, epidermal growth factor, and serine protease domains, forming an arched structure. The C-terminal helix of the Gla domain (named aromatic residues stack domain) contributes to the formation of the lower part of the concave surface on the right side of the factor IXa molecule, which is known as a candidate site for the binding to factor VIIIa. Because the Mg-8-binding site points toward the concave surface, Mg-8 might play an important role in binding to factor VIIIa. Similarly, Mg-8 is expected to contribute to the binding to factors VIIa and X. In Fig. 2 (B and C), IXGD1–46 and XGD1–44 are shown oriented relative to a phospholipid membrane surface placed schematically at the bottom of the figure. Binding of the Gla domain of factor IX to membrane could then take place by Mg-1 mediating an interaction between the Gla residues of factor IX and the negative head groups of the phospholipids via Mg2+ bridging. In addition, another Mg2+ or Ca2+ ion (not shown) could participate in forming an ion bridge with Gla33 of factor IX, as in the case of factor X (18Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Atoda H. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7230-7234Google Scholar). Such a protein-membrane interaction involving Ca2+ ion bridging has been shown in the crystal structure of the complex between annexin V and phospholipid head groups (36Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Google Scholar, 37Nelsestuen G.L. Ostrowski B.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-437Google Scholar). The phospholipids at the membrane surface interact through Ca2+ ions, which are able to gain access only from the opposite side of the protein. As in the case with annexin V, the Ca2+ or Mg2+ ions, which are present on the surface of the factor IX Gla domain, may form bridges with the phospholipid head groups. The hydrophobic residues Phe4, Lue5, and Val8 of factor X Gla domain, on the other hand, are considered to be buried in the membrane surface (18Mizuno H. Fujimoto Z. Atoda H. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7230-7234Google Scholar, 38Nelsestuen G.L. Shah A.M. Harvey S.B. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 58: 355-389Google Scholar). The residue Phe4 in factor X corresponds to Lys5 in factor IX, which may lie on the membrane surface, forming direct interactions with negative head groups of the phospholipid. This type of interaction probably contributes only slightly toward the association of the Gla domain on the phospholipid membrane, because the hydrophilic side chains of Lys5 and Arg11 (Fig. 2B) exist in the proximity of the residues inserted in the putative membrane. These interactions and Mg2+ bridging (which brings the Gla domain and membrane closer together than Ca2+ bridging) cause a tilt in the long axis of the Gla domain relative to the membrane surface, such that a small clockwise rotation is seen if Fig. 2B is compared with Fig. 2C. Even if the tilt angle is small, the location of the active site of the catalytic domain relative to that of the membrane-binding site is significantly affected because the active site, which corresponds to the position of D-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone in Fig. 5 is distant from the membrane. Further studies are required to determine whether such positional differences caused by Mg2+ ions are biologically relevant. Freedman et al. (20Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16227-16236Google Scholar) have reported that synthetic factor IX Gla domain (residues 1–47) failed to bind to phospholipids when only Mg2+ ions were present because of disorder in the structure, especially within residues 1–11. Four Ca2+ ions from Ca-2 to Ca-5 are essential to stabilize the ω-loop region for membrane-binding (20Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16227-16236Google Scholar, 39Falls L.A. Furie B.C. Jacobs M. Furie B. Rigby A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23895-23902Google Scholar) because these Ca2+ ions bind to conserved Gla7 and Gla8 residues in this region (Fig. 2B). The replacement by Mg2+ ions may lead to destabilization of the structure of the Gla domain, particularly in this region because of significant differences that exist with Ca2+ ion in both coordination distance and coordination sphere (Mg2+ ion takes generally a typical bipyramidal configuration and six coordination). This may explain why the Ca2+ ions are not replaced by Mg2+ ions in the present structure. In conclusion, three Mg2+ ion-binding sites have been identified in the crystal structure of the factor IX Gla domain 1–46 in complex with its binding protein. Overall, the present results confirm the importance of Mg2+ ions as augmentors of Ca2+ ions in factor IX activity and lend support for a pathway presented before involving Mg2+ ions in the initial stage of the coagulation cascade. Because the activation of factor X is affected by Mg2+ ions when factor VIIIa is present (10Sekiya F. Yoshida M. Yamashita T. Morita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8541-8544Google Scholar), it will be necessary to repeat the experiment with all components present, including phospholipids, to understand how Mg2+ ions accelerate the coagulation cascade.

https://openalex.org/W1972676329,"During hepatic fibrogenesis, quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSC) become active and <i>trans</i>-differentiate into myofibroblast-like cells. This process coincides with an increase in cell proliferation, loss of stored vitamin A droplets, and excessive production and deposition of extracellular matrix components. HSC activation is coupled with the sequential expression of cytokine receptors, including platelet-derived growth factor-β receptor (PDGF-βR). Although the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood, it is widely accepted that oxidative stress plays critical roles in activation of HSC during hepatic fibrogenesis. We have recently demonstrated that the antioxidant (–)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major component in green tea extracts, significantly inhibited the proliferation of passaged HSC. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Since PDGF is a potent mitogen for HSC and mediates the early proliferative response, it was hypothesized that EGCG might inhibit HSC proliferation by interfering with the PDGF signal transduction. In this report, we demonstrated that EGCG, in two steps, significantly and effectively inhibited the proliferation of primary and passaged HSC. The polyphenolic compound initiated its inhibitory action by rapidly blocking the phosphorylation of tyrosines in PDGF-βR elicited by PDGF in serum. This action was short lived, persisting for a few hours. In addition, this antioxidant inhibited the gene expression of PDGF-βR by blocking the activation of transcription factors activator protein-1 and NF-κB, which were required for the gene transcription. The latter action remained effective for no less than 48 hours. These results provided a novel insight into the mechanisms by which EGCG inhibits HSC growth. The inhibitory effect of the natural antioxidant, its long history of beverage consumption without adverse health effects, and higher potent antioxidant capability make it a good candidate for therapeutic treatment and prevention of hepatic fibrosis."

We studied the degradation of all of the published Aβ genetic variants by recombinant rat IDE (rIDE). Monomeric Aβ wild type, Flemish (A21G), Italian (E22K), and Iowa (D23N) variants were readily degraded by rIDE with a similar efficiency. However, proteolysis of Aβ Dutch (E22Q) and Arctic (E22G) was significantly lower as compared with Aβ wild type and the rest of the mutant peptides. In the case of Aβ Dutch, inefficient proteolysis was related to a high content of β structure as assessed by circular dichroism. All of the Aβ variants were cleaved at Glu3-Phe4 and Phe4-Arg5 in addition to the previously described major sites within positions 13–15 and 18–21. SDS-stable Aβ dimers were highly resistant to proteolysis by rIDE regardless of the variant, suggesting that IDE recognizes a conformation that is available for interaction only in monomeric Aβ. These results raise the possibility that upregulation of IDE may promote the clearance of soluble Aβ in hereditary forms of Aβ diseases.

The accumulation of amyloid β peptide (Aβ) 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β; Aβ PP, amyloid β pre-cursor protein; IDE, insulin-degrading enzyme; rIDE, recombinant insulin-degrading enzyme; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; WT, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CD, circular dichroism; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; HCHWA-D, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Dutch type. 1The abbreviations used are: Aβ, amyloid β; Aβ PP, amyloid β pre-cursor protein; IDE, insulin-degrading enzyme; rIDE, recombinant insulin-degrading enzyme; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; WT, wild type; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CD, circular dichroism; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; HCHWA-D, hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis, Dutch type. in the brain is a central process in a number of human neurodegenerative disorders that may be grouped as “amyloid β diseases” (1Castaño E.M. Frangione B. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 122-132Google Scholar). In Alzheimer's disease, Aβ is mainly found within senile plaques in the neurophil and vascular lesions, whereas in sporadic and hereditary amyloid angiopathies, Aβ deposits are mainly associated with cortical and leptomeningeal vessels leading to stroke or multi-infarct dementia. To a lesser extent, cerebral Aβ deposits are also present in normal aging (2Coria F. Castaño E.M. Frangione B. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 129: 422-428Google Scholar). Autosomal dominant mutations in the amyloid β precursor protein (Aβ PP) gene result in amino acid substitutions at position 21, 22, or 23 of Aβ sequence. Although these Aβ variants present with a primarily vascular deposition, they translate into different clinical phenotypes. In this regard, Aβ Arctic (E22G) and Aβ Iowa (D23N) are characterized by presenile dementia and Aβ Flemish (A21G) is associated with early onset dementia and cerebral hemorrhage, whereas Aβ Dutch (E22Q) and Aβ Italian (E22K) variants have a predominant vascular phenotype characterized by massive strokes (3Nilsberth C.

The underlying mechanism of aggregation and deposition in vivo may be strongly influenced by the type of amino acid substitution as well as the location of mutations in the Aβ peptide. In vitro studies have shown that Aβ E22Q and Aβ D23N form typical amyloid fibrils at a higher rate than wild-type Aβ and that Aβ E22G assembles into unique protofibrils that may be toxic to neurons (3Nilsberth C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32860-32866Google Scholar). In the case of Aβ A21G, overproduction of the peptide may contribute as a pathogenic mechanism (11De Jonghe C. Zehr C. Yager D. Prada C.M. Younkin S. Hendriks L. Van Broeckhoven C. Eckman C.B. Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 5: 281-286Google Scholar, 12Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Condron M.M. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 869-877Google Scholar). Regarding Aβ E22K, deposition seems not to be related with fibril formation rate, and yet this variant may be toxic to human cerebro-vascular smooth muscle cells in culture (6Miravalle L. Tokuda T.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2209-2212Google Scholar). In addition to the intrinsic aggregation properties of Aβ and its genetic variants or the rate of their production, recent studies (14Gau J.T. Steinhilb M.L. Kao T.C. D'Amato C.J. Gaut J.R. Frey K.A. Turner R.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 731-738Google Scholar, 15Kuo Y.M. Beach T.G. Sue L.I. Scott S. Layne K.J. Kokjohn T.A. Kalback W.M.

Med. 2001; 7: 609-618Google Scholar) in animal models have suggested that a defective clearance may influence the progressive accumulation of Aβ in the neurophil and cerebral vessels. Among the mechanisms that remove Aβ peptides from the brain, degradation by several proteases including neprilysin, endothelin-converting enzyme, and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) is now being considered as an important component of the Aβ clearance process (16Iwata N.

IDE is a highly conserved thiol metalloprotease with ubiquitous expression including the brain (20Baumeister H. Müller D. Rehbein M. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 250-254Google Scholar, 21Kuo W. Montag A.G. Rosner M.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 604-611Google Scholar, 22Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3835-3839Google Scholar). Regarding its physiological role, IDE has been implicated in cellular growth and differentiation, modulation of proteasomal activity, and steroid signaling (23Bennett R.G. Hamel F G. Duckworth W.C. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2508-2517Google Scholar, reviewed in Ref. 24Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J.M. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 149-158Google Scholar). In addition to insulin for which the protease has a Km in the low nanomolar range, IDE is known to degrade several peptides capable of forming amyloid fibrils in vitro and in vivo including glucagon, amylin, atrial natriuretic peptide, calcitonin, and Aβ (25Kurochkin I.V. Goto S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 33-37Google Scholar, 26Bennett R.G. Duckworth W C. Hamel F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36621-36625Google Scholar, reviewed in Ref. 27Kurochkin I.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 421-425Google Scholar). Studies using rat and human brain tissue homogenates, IDE-transfected cell lines, and primary neuronal cultures have supported a role of IDE in Aβ degradation in vivo (28McDermott J.R. Gibson A.M. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 49-56Google Scholar, 29Perez A. Morelli L. Cresto J.C. Castaño E.M. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 247-255Google Scholar, 30Qiu W.Q. Walsh D.M. Ye Z. Vekrellis K. Zhang J.

J Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2561-2570Google Scholar). Moreover, IDE has been shown to protect cultured neurons from Aβ toxicity, indicating that the Aβ fragments generated by IDE are not themselves toxic to cells (32Mukherjee A. Song E. Kihiko-Ehmann M. Goodman J.P. St. Pyrek J. Estus E. Hersh L.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8745-8749Google Scholar). Regarding the state of Aβ oligomerization and IDE specificity, it has been proposed that IDE is able to degrade efficiently monomeric Aβ as opposed to oligomeric Aβ species that are thought to be more toxic to neurons or vascular cells than typical amyloid fibrils (33Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Google Scholar). However, whether IDE is capable of degrading Aβ bearing pathogenic amino acid substitutions and how these changes may affect specificity is not known. The aim of our work was to study the degradation of Aβ genetic variants associated with human disease by recombinant IDE in vitro and to characterize the proteolytic products from each of these Aβ mutant peptides.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of Recombinant Rat IDE—The plasmid pECE-IDE (kindly provided by Richard Roth, Stanford University), containing the coding region of rat IDE cDNA was used as a template for the PCR amplification of a truncated version of IDE using sense 5′-AGCACAGGATCCATGAATAATCCGGCCAT-3′ (nucleotides 139–155) and antisense 5′-TTCTCGAGGAGTTTTGCCGCCATGA-3′ (nucleotides 3072–3056) primers of the rat IDE cDNA sequence. Sites for the restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI, respectively, were introduced to facilitate cloning. The PCR DNA fragment was digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into pET-30a(+) (Novagen) previously digested with the same restriction enzymes to generate the pET-IDE construct. Recombinant IDE 42-1019 (rIDE) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified to homogeneity using a Hi Trap Ni-chelating columm (Amersham Biosciences) following the method described by Chesneau and Rosner (34Chesneau V. Rosner M.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 91-98Google Scholar). Purity, as assessed by SDS-PAGE, was >95%. rIDE proteolytic activity was determined using [125I]insulin as described below.Production of Anti-IDE Polyclonal Antibodies—A region between amino acids 97 and 273 of the rat IDE sequence was amplified by PCR using as template pECE-IDE with the following primers: forward 5′-CTGAGCGGATCCCTGTCAGACCCTCCA-3′ and reverse 5′-CAATGTGAATTCCTTCACCACCAGATT-3′. After digestion with BamHI and EcoRI, the 530-bp insert was subcloned into pGex2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). GST-IDE97–273 fusion protein was expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's suggestions. After immunization of New Zealand rabbits with GST-IDE97–273, the antiserum (BC2) was sequentially purified using a BL21/GST lysate coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) and a GST-agarose (Sigma) affinity columns, respectively. Specificity of anti-IDE antiserum BC2 was tested by Western blot against GST, GST-IDE97–273, purified rIDE (see above), and soluble fractions from human and rat brain and liver in which a single 115-kDa band was detected (data not shown).Synthetic Peptides—Synthetic Aβ-(1–40)-peptides such as Aβ WT, Aβ A21G, Aβ E22Q, Aβ E22K, Aβ E22G, Aβ D23N, and Aβ-(1–40)/Aβ-(1–42) containing the rodent sequence (35Fraser P.E. Nguyen J.T. Inouye H. Surewicz W.K. Selkoe D.J. Podlisny M.B. Kirschner D.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10716-10723Google Scholar) were synthesized by the W. M. Keck Foundation (Yale University, CT). All of the peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and their purity was evaluated by amino acid sequence analysis and laser desorption mass spectrometry. Lyophilized aliquots of the peptides were dissolved at a concentration of 70 μm in distilled water as determined with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) after centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min to eliminate large aggregates. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C.SDS-PAGE and Western Blot—Proteins obtained from E. coli BL21 lysates and after the different steps of purification were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE in Tris-Tricine gels. Aβ peptides were run on 12.5% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE. For Western blot analysis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Signet Laboratories) at 1:1000, anti-IDE monoclonal 9B12 (kindly provided by Richard Roth) at 1:1000, and polyclonal antibody BC2 at 1:1000. Immunoreactivity was detected with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-labeled IgG and ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblots were scanned with STORM 840 and analyzed with ImageQuant 5.1 software (Amersham Biosciences).In-gel Tryptic Digestion of rIDE and Amino Acid Sequencing—After SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, the band of 125 kDa was cut and the gel slice was incubated in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3 containing 45 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 60 °C. The tube was cooled at room temperature, and 100 mm iodoacetamide was added followed by incubation for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The gel was then washed in 50% acetonitrile, 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate with shaking for 1 h, cut in pieces, and transferred to a small tube. Acetonitrile was added to shrink the gel pieces, and the sample was dried in a rotatory evaporator. The gel pieces were re-swollen with 10 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, containing trypsin at a 10:1 ratio (w/w, substrate:enzyme). The sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C, and digestion products were extracted twice from the gel with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min. Combined extractions were loaded into a C18 high pressure liquid chromatography column (220 × 1 mm), and peptides eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Selected peaks were applied to a 477A protein-peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems) and subjected to Edman degradation sequence analysis at the Laboratorio Nacional de Investigacíon y Servicios en Péptidos y Proteinas facility (CONICET).Degradation Assays—1 μg of each Aβ synthetic peptide was incubated alone or with 500 ng of purified rIDE in 10 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, in the presence or absence of 1 mm 1,10-phenantroline. After 30, 60, 90, and 120 min of incubation at 37 °C, samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with 6E10 as described above. After each time point, degradation by rIDE was expressed as the percentage of remaining Aβ monomer or dimer as compared with Aβ incubated without the enzyme. [125I]Insulin (specific activity 300 μCi/μg, kindly provided by Edgardo Poskus, University of Buenos Aires.) was incubated with rIDE alone or in the presence of the following sets of inhibitors: 1) 1 μm unlabeled insulin; 2) a mixture of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A; 3) a mixture of 1 mm 1,10-phenantroline and 5 mm EDTA, respectively, in the same buffer as above. After incubation for various time points, the sample was run on SDS-PAGE, and the remaining intact [125 I]insulin was analyzed and quantitated with a STORM 840 PhophorImager (Amersham Biosciences).Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectra—Aliquots of Aβ synthetic peptides freshly dissolved at 60 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were loaded into a 0.1-nm path length quartz cell, and the circular dichroism spectra were recorded in the far-ultraviolet light using a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter (JASCO Corporation). Forty scans for each experimental condition were obtained at 0.2-nm intervals over the wavelength range of 190–260 nm. Final spectra were obtained after the subtraction of background readings of blanks.Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Molecular masses of intact Aβ peptides and the products of rIDE degradation were determined at the New York University Protein Analysis Facility. Aβ-containing samples (10 μl of final volume) were passed through reversed-phase ZipTip (Millipore) following manufacturer's instructions and analyzed on a Micromass TofSpec-2E (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer in linear mode using standard instrument settings. Internal and/or external calibration was carried out using angiotensin I (average mass = 1296.5 Da) and insulin (average mass = 5733.5 Da).Isolation of Aβ from Leptomeningeal Vessels—Leptomeningeal vascular amyloid from a patient with hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis Dutch type (HCHWA-D) was isolated as described previously (36Castaño E.M. Prelli F. Soto C. Beavis R. Matsubara E. Shoji M. Frangione B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32185-32191Google Scholar). Leptomeninges were dissected from brain coronal sections, cut with scissors into 1–3-mm pieces, and placed in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, on ice. Tissue was then washed by resuspension in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing protease inhibitors (buffer A) and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The procedure was repeated 5 times. The material was collected by filtration through a 50-μm nylon mesh (Spectrum), washed with buffer A without inhibitors, and resuspended in 20 volumes of 2 mm CaCl2 in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.3 mg/ml collagenase CLS-3 (Worthington) and 10 μg/ml DNase (Worthington). The mixture was incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. After digestion, the suspension was filtered through a 350-μm nylon mesh and the filtrate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 12 min. The pellet was resuspended in 2% SDS in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The SDS-insoluble material was recovered by centrifugation as above and washed three times with distilled water. The pellet was dissolved in 10 volumes of 99% formic acid (Sigma) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was then loaded on a Superose 12 column (10 × 300 mm) (Amersham Biosciences). Amyloid peptides were separated in 75% formic acid at 0.2 ml/min using a Bio-Cad Sprint chromatography system. Eluent was monitored at 280 nm, collected in 1-ml fractions, and analyzed as above.RESULTSExpression and Characterization of Recombinant Rat IDE— Our IDE bacterial expression vector pET-IDE encodes rat IDE (positions 42–1019) with a His6 tag at its N terminus to facilitate the purification of the protease with a Ni-affinity columm. After elution with a step gradient of increasing imidazole concentrations, we obtained a highly purified recombinant protein with an apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa as assessed by SDS-PAGE. Western blot using our polyclonal antibody BC2 specifically recognized this 125-kDa fusion protein (Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, the protein did not display immunoreactivity on Western blot with monoclonal 9B12, a well characterized anti-rat IDE antibody (data not shown) (37Duckworth W.C. Hamel F.G. Bennett R. Ryan M.P. Roth RA. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2984-2987Google Scholar). To determine its identity, we performed “in-gel” digestion with trypsin followed by separation on microbore high pressure liquid chromatography and N-terminal amino acid sequence of a tryptic fragment. The sequence NVPLPEF matched positions 282–288 of rat IDE (20Baumeister H. Müller D. Rehbein M. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1993; 317: 250-254Google Scholar), confirming the identity of our recombinant protease and suggesting that 9B12 may indeed recognize a posttranslationally modified epitope in rat IDE that is not present in IDE expressed in bacteria. To characterize the activity of recombinant rIDE, we analyzed the degradation of [125I]insulin. After 1 h of incubation, rIDE was able to digest [125I]insulin and this activity was totally inhibited by EDTA-1,10-phenantroline and blocked to 80% in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled insulin (Fig. 1B). These results are fully consistent with the reported characterization of human recombinant IDE expressed in E. coli (34Chesneau V. Rosner M.R. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 91-98Google Scholar) and rat recombinant IDE produced in a baculovirus-insect cell system (32Mukherjee A. Song E. Kihiko-Ehmann M. Goodman J.P. St. Pyrek J. Estus E. Hersh L.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8745-8749Google Scholar).Degradation of Aβ WT and Aβ Genetic Variants by rIDE—We followed the degradation of Aβ WT and Aβ genetic variants by rIDE using SDS-PAGE and Western blot with monoclonal 6E10 that recognizes an epitope within positions 1–16 of Aβ (38Pirttila T. Kim K.S. Mehta P.D. Frey H. Wisniewski H.M. J. Neurol. Sci. 1994; 127: 90-95Google Scholar) The relative amount of Aβ monomers and dimers that remained intact after incubation with rIDE was estimated by densitometry. This method allowed an accurate discrimination between monomeric and oligomeric Aβ as opposed to high pressure liquid chromatography or trichloroacetic acid precipitation (28McDermott J.R. Gibson A.M. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 49-56Google Scholar, 29Perez A. Morelli L. Cresto J.C. Castaño E.M. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 247-255Google Scholar). The absence of Aβ degradation products on Western blots may reflect the loss of the 6E10 epitope attributed to rIDE activity. Alternatively, the Aβ N-terminal fragments generated by the protease may be too small to be detected on SDS-PAGE. Under the conditions of our assay, the quantitation of degradation showed linearity up to 90 min of incubation (data not shown); therefore, a 60-min incubation was the time selected for the comparative analysis. As indicated in Fig. 2, A and B, monomeric Aβ WT, Aβ A21G, Aβ E22K, and Aβ D23N were degraded at 75.2 ± 3, 81.5 ± 9.2, 79.5 ± 12, and 84.7 ± 7.6%, respectively. rIDE was substantially less efficient in degrading Aβ E22Q and Aβ E22G monomers (42.3 ± 6 and 34.6 ± 6%, respectively, p < 0.01 as compared with Aβ WT). In the presence of 1,10-phenantroline, degradation of Aβ WT was inhibited almost completely (Fig. 2B). In contrast to Aβ monomers, degradation of dimers was consistently <10% for all of the variants studied (Fig. 2B), in agreement with the results reported recently on endogenous Aβ WT generated by Aβ PP-transfected cell lines (33Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Google Scholar).Fig. 2Degradation of Aβ variants by rIDE.Panel A, Western blot analysis with monoclonal 6E10 of degradation of Aβ WT and Aβ genetic variants by rIDE. m, Aβ monomers; d, Aβ dimers.

All of the Aβ fragments observed by MALDI-TOF MS are summarized in Table I, and Fig. 3 shows an schematic representation of the cleavage sites. Several fragments starting at Phe4 and Arg5 were found in Aβ WT and in all of the Aβ variants. These peptides were not the products of truncated synthesis as shown by MS analysis of undigested Aβ peptides and were not found when Aβs were incubated with rIDE in the presence of 1,10-phenantroline (data not shown). Moreover, Phe and Arg as P1′ residues are compatible with the known specificity of IDE (28McDermott J.R. Gibson A.M. Neurochem. Res. 1997; 22: 49-56Google Scholar, 41Pallitto M.M. Murphy R.M. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1805-1822Google Scholar). Therefore, it seemed probable that rIDE was capable of hydrolyzing Aβ Glu3-Phe4 and Phe4-Arg5 peptide bonds. In Aβ A21G, there was a consistent absence of fragments ending at Phe20 or starting at Gly21, suggesting the specific loss of a cleavage site. Notably, when we analyzed the digestion of rodent Aβ that present Gly instead of Arg at position 5, no fragments indicative of hydrolysis at the Phe4-Gly5 site were found, neither in rodent Aβ-(1–40) (Table I and Fig. 3) nor in rodent Aβ-(1–42) (data not shown), whereas all of the other cleavage sites present in human Aβ WT were conserved. The Dutch variant Aβ E22Q showed the apparent loss of sites at Val18-Phe19 and Lys28-Gly29, whereas in the Italian variant Aβ E22K, the latter cleavage site was also absent. This peptide bond has been reported to be resistant to IDE in Aβ WT-(1–42) (32Mukherjee A. Song E. Kihiko-Ehmann M. Goodman J.P. St. Pyrek J. Estus E. Hersh L.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8745-8749Google Scholar), and therefore, its hydrolysis by IDE may depend upon oligomerization rather than primary structure. Alternatively, the presence of Gly at P1′ may impose a subsite restriction as suggested by the loss of cleavage sites in the Aβ Flemish and rodent variants. The Iowa type Aβ D23N differed notably from all of the other Aβ peptides studied. Fragments consistent with positions 1–26, 15–26, and 27–40 were found, indicating the cleavage at the Ser26-Asn27 bond (Table I and Fig. 3) and pointing to the possible importance of the Asp23 in the folding of the Aβ peptide.Table IMass spectrometry analysis of the cleavage products of Aβ variants by insulin-degrading enzymeAβ fragmentMolecular mass of Aβ variantsAβWTAβA21GAβE22KAβE22QAβE22GAβD23NAβrodentObs.Calc.Obs.Calc.Obs.Calc.Obs.Calc.Obs.Calc.Obs.Calc.Obs.Calc.Da1-131561.81561.6NF1562.61561.61561.91561.31562.21561.61562.11561.61466.31465.51-1416991698.31699.51693.71699.91698.71699.51698.71699.41698.71699.31698.71603.71602.61-182167.92167.3NF2165.62167.3NF2168.92167.32168.12167.32072.92071.21-192315.12314.52315.62314.5NFNF2315.72314.52315.32314.52220.22218.41-202462.62461.7NF2462.92461.7NFNFNFNF1-26NFNFNFNFNF3019.23019.2NF1-28NFNFNFNFNF3261.33261.53168.23166.54-131246.41246.31246.81246.312471246.31246.71246.31246.71246.31246.71246.31151.21150.24-141383.71383.513841383.51384.21385.513841383.413841383.51383.91385.5NF4-1920001999.2NFNFNFNFNFNF5-141236.31236.31236.81236.312371236.31236.61236.31236.61236.31236.61236.3NF14-20NFNFNF918.9918.1NFNFNF14-281719.41718.91705.81704.9NFNF1647.41646.9NFNF15-26NFNFNFNFNF1338.61338.5NF15-2815821581.81568.31567.8NFNF1510.51509.7NFNF15-40NFNF2650.52648.2NF2578.52579.1NFNF19-28NF1100.21099.2NFNFNFNFNFNF19-402180.42180.6NFNFNFNFNFNF20-40NF2020.32019.42033.52032.42033.82032.41962.11961.32033.12032.32034.62033.521-40NFNF1886.61885.31886.51885.21814.61814.11885.71885.21887.51886.227-40NFNFNFNFNF1327.71327.7NF29-40NF1084.91085.4NFNF1085.51086NFNF Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Schematic representation of cleavage sites within Aβ WT, Aβ rodent, and Aβ human genetic variants by rIDE.Arrows show the peptide bonds hydrolyzed by rIDE.

Here we examined a regulatory role of Cbl-b in Crk-L-C3G signaling pathway. We found that Cbl-b associates with, and induces, ubiquitin conjugation to Crk-L, which requires a functional RING finger. Cbl-b deficiency does not affect Crk-L stability, but its association with C3G. In Cbl-b–/– T cells, the interaction between Crk-L and C3G, and the activity of the small GTPase Rap1, are increased. Cbl-b–/– T cells also display increased adhesion and cell surface binding to ICAM-1, a finding that is supported by the enhanced clustering of LFA-1 in Cbl-b–/– T cells in response to TCR stimulation. Thus, Cbl-b plays a negative role in Crk-L-C3G-mediated Rap1 and LFA-1 activation in T cells. It was previously reported that Cbl-b associates with Crk-L in Jurkat T cells.

Engagement of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell antigen receptor; Ub, ubiquitin; RBD, rap1 binding domain; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. by the antigenic peptide plus major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the antigen presenting cells triggers rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of protein-tyrosine kinases, the Src family (Lck and Fyn), and the Syk family (Zap-70). Activation of these kinases in turn induces tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of intracellular substrates including adaptor proteins to form intermolecular network (1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar, 2Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Google Scholar). Cbl is one of the adaptor proteins, which consists of an amino-terminal SH2-like domain, a RING finger, and carboxyl-terminal proline-rich sequences with potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (3Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Google Scholar). Previous studies from numerous laboratories have demonstrated that Cbl associates with a number of critical signaling molecules upon T cell activation including Zap-70, Grb-2, 14-3-3, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Crk-L (3Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Google Scholar). In addition to its adaptor's role, Cbl also functions as an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, whose RING finger domain binds to a Ub-loaded conjugation enzyme or E2, and whose other protein interaction domains recruit potential substrates; Cbl then helps transfer Ub from the E2 to the substrate (4Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Google Scholar, 5Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Google Scholar). The identification of Cbl as an E3 has facilitated our understanding of Cbl in the regulation of intracellular signaling transduction. Cbl-b was isolated as a mammalian Cbl homologue from human breast caner cells and it is ubiquitously expressed and has a very high homology with Cbl, particularly in the amino terminus and the RING finger domain (6Keane M.M. Rivero-Lezcano O.M. Mitchell J.A. Robbins K.C. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377Google Scholar). The importance of Cbl-b in T cell regulation is underscored by the increased proliferation and cytokine production in Cbl-b-deficient T cells (7Bachmaier K. Krawczyk C. Kozieradzki I. Kong Y.Y. Sasaki T. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Mariathasan S. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Itie A. Le J. Ohashi P.S. Sarosi I. Nishina H. Lipkowitz S. Penninger J.M.

Cbl-b–/– mice also display spontaneous or antigen-induced autoimmunity. We previously showed that Cbl-b has E3 ligase activity by inducing ubiquitionation of p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K (9Fang D. Wang H.-Y. Fang N. Altman Y. Elly C. Liu Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4872-4878Google Scholar). Instead of inducing degradation of p85, Ub conjugation to p85 affects its interaction with upstream molecules such as TCR ζ chain and CD28, thus regulating the protein complex formation (10Fang D. Liu Y.-C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 870-875Google Scholar). In human Jukat T cell line, we observed that Cbl-b becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and associates with Crk-L in an activation-dependent manner (11Elly C. Witte S. Zhang Z. Rosnet O. Lipokowitz S. Altman A. Liu Y.-C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1153-1162Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of Cbl-b and Crk-L interaction remains unclear. Crk-L is an adaptor protein that is composed of an NH2-terminal SH2 domain and COOH-terminal two SH3 domains. The SH2 domain has been shown to bind to Cbl and/or Cbl-b in an activation-dependent manner, whereas a COOH-terminal SH3 domain constitutively associates with C3G, a guanine exchange factor, which has been shown to be a specific exchange factor for Rap-1 (12Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Google Scholar). The Cbl-Crk-L-C3G signal pathway has been proposed to play a role in Rap-1 activation and therefore in negative regulation of Ras signal pathway in T cells (13Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Google Scholar). Whether Cbl-b is also involved in Rap1 activation in T cells remains to be determined. In this study, we examined whether Cbl-b acts as an E3 ligase for Crk-L and whether Cbl-b deficiency affects Crk-l-C3G signaling in response to TCR stimulation. The study may shed light on the biological function of Cbl-b in T cell activation and tolerance induction. Antibodies and Plasmids—Polyclonal antibodies specific to Cbl-b, Crk-L, C3G, Fyn, Lck, and Grb2, and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to c-Myc, HA, Zap-70, Lck, Crk-L, and Ub were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). mAbs specific to Rap1, and Raf-1, were purchased from PharMingen (La Jolla, CA). Phosphotyrosine-specific mAb was purified from culture supernatant of 4G10 B cell hybridoma, and mAb, anti-CD3ϵ, was purified from the culture supernatant of B cell hybridomas 145-2C11. Cbl-b cDNAs encoding wild-type Cbl-b, or Cbl-b RING finger mutants harboring Cys to Ala (Cbl-b CA), or Trp to Ala (Cbl-b WA) mutation, the Ub cDNA with a Myc epitope tag, and the Crk-L plasmid were described previously (9Fang D. Wang H.-Y. Fang N. Altman Y. Elly C. Liu Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4872-4878Google Scholar, 11Elly C. Witte S. Zhang Z. Rosnet O. Lipokowitz S. Altman A. Liu Y.-C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1153-1162Google Scholar). The bacterial expression plasmid containing glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RalGDS Rap1 binding domain (RBD) was provided by J. Bos. Preparation of GST fusion protein was performed as described previously (4Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Google Scholar). Mice and T Cell Activation—Cbl-b-deficient (Cbl–/–) mice on a C57BL/6 background were originally provided by M. Naramura and H. Gu at the National Institutes of Health. Primary T cells were collected from lymph nodes of 6–8-week-old mice. Single-cell suspensions of T cells were prepared at 3 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. T cells were either left untreated or were added with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3ϵ. The cells were incubated on ice for 10 min before stimulation at 37 °C for various times as indicated. Cell Culture and Transfection—Jurkat-TAG T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. For protein expression in Jurkat T cells, cells were transfected with an appropriate amount of plasmid (usually 1–5 μg in total) by electroporation (240 V, 950 microfarads; Bio-Rad). After 48 h, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) for 30 min at 4 °C, and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. For displaying ubiquitinated protein, 0.1% SDS and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol were added into lysis buffer to disrupt nonspecific protein interactions. Adhesion Assay—96-Well Nunc Maxisorp Immuno flat-bottomed plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of soluble recombinant murine ICAM-1-Fc (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), washed, blocked with 2% BSA/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C, and then washed with medium. 1 × 106 purified lymph node T cells in 100 μl of 2% BSA/PBS were mixed with 10 μg/ml of anti-CD3ϵ or 20 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Cells were allowed to attach for 30 min at 37 °C and nonadherent cells removed with warm RPMI1640 medium. Adherent cells were quantified, and all data are expressed as the mean of the percentage of binding cells relative to total cell input from three replicate wells. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Lymphocytes from Cbl-b+/+ and Cbl-b–/– mice were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-, phycoerythrin-, or cychrome C-conjugated antibodies to murine CD4, CD8, and CD11a (mAb, 2D10; PharMingen). The cells were preincubated with anti-FcγR for 10 min and stained with the antibodies on ice for 30 min. After a final wash, cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed by using CellQuest software. Measurement of Soluble ICAM-1 Binding—1 × 105 lymphocytes were treated without or with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 antibody or 10 μg/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, incubated with 10 μg/ml soluble recombinant murine ICAM-1-Fc (R&D Systems) 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice, and then incubated with 10 μg/ml Fc-specific FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at 4 °C. Unbond secondary antibody was removed by washing twice and fluorescence of live cells detected using the FACScan flow cytometer. Rap1 Activation Assay—T lymphocytes were incubated in cold RPMI 1640 with or without anti-CD3 antibody for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice with cold medium and activated for the indicated time periods with 20 μg/ml goat anti-hamster antibody at 37 °C. 2 × 107 cells were lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold Rap1 lysis buffer containing 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatantes were incubated with 5 μg of GST-RalGDS-RBD fusion protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted and rinsed three times with the lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer and separated by electrophoresis on a SDS-PAGE (12%), followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Affinity-purified activated Rap1 were detected by immunoblotting using anti-Rap1 antibody. LFA-1 Clustering Assay—Purified CD4+ T cells from Cbl-b+/+ and Cbl–/– lymphocytes were incubated in cold medium with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3ϵ (clone 145-2C11) on ice for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with cold medium and cross-linked by incubating with 20 μg/ml goat anti-hamster IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) at 37 °C for 40 min. Cells were allowed to settle on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with PBS, and blocked with 2% BSA/PBS for 30 min. Samples were stained with FITC-anti-LFA-1 antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) for 2 h at room temperature. LFA-1 clustering was visualized by using a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). At least 100 T cells were counted for cap formation in each experiment. Metabolic Labeling and Pulse-Chase Experiment—The experiment was performed by following previously published procedures (14Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Google Scholar, 15Shao Y. Elly C. Liu Y.C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 425-431Google Scholar). Briefly, primary lymph node T cells from wild-type and Cbl-b–/– mice were seeded at 5 × 106 cells/well in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cystine, plus 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml each) and were then labeled for 1 h at 37 °C by adding 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cystine (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). The cells were then washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and chased for different times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested at indicated time and the cell lysates were precleared with protein G-Sepharose for 30 min and were immunoprecipitated with anti-Crk-L or anti-IκBα. Immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The radiolabeled protein bands were quantified by using an NIH Image 1.61 software. Cbl-b Associates with Crk-L in Primary T Cells—We previously reported that stimulation of human Jurkat T cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl-b and its association with Crk-L (11Elly C. Witte S. Zhang Z. Rosnet O. Lipokowitz S. Altman A. Liu Y.-C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1153-1162Google Scholar). To examine whether similar events occur in murine primary T cells, we incubated mouse lymph node T cells with 2C11 anti-CD3 antibody alone or plus anti-CD28. Anti-CD3 stimulation indeed caused tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl-b, as revealed by blotting anti-Cbl-b immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1A, top panel). Costimulation with anti-CD28 further enhanced Cbl-b tyrosine phosphorylation. Crk-L was detected in anti-Cbl-b immunoprecipitates from anti-CD3-stimulated, or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28-stimulated, primary T cells (Fig. 1A, middle panel). Equivalent amounts of Cbl-b were present in all the immunoprecipitaes from untreated or treated cells (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Similarly, when the cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Crk-L antibody, Cbl-b was detected from samples treated with anti-CD3 antibody (Fig. 1B, top panel). The coimmunoprecipitation was further increased in samples treated with anti-CD28 costimulation. The data indicate that like in human Jurkat T cells, Cbl-b and Crk-L form a complex in murine primary T cells. Cbl-b Promotes Crk-L Ubiquitination without Affecting Its Stability—The recent identification of Cbl family proteins as E3 ligases for its binding proteins prompted us to investigate whether Cbl-b also promotes Ub conjugation to Crk-L. To this end, we cotransfected Cbl-b, Crk-L, and Myc-Ub in Jurkat T cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, coexpression of Cbl-b with Crk-L resulted in the formation of high molecular smears in anti-Crk-L immunoprecipitates, when blotted with anti-Myc antibody, suggesting polyubiquitination of Crk-L. Of note, Ub conjugation to Crk-L was increased upon anti-CD3 stimulation. We previously described that mutation at the conserved Trp or Cys residues of Cbl-b RING finger domain abolishes its E3 ligase activity (9Fang D. Wang H.-Y. Fang N. Altman Y. Elly C. Liu Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4872-4878Google Scholar). To consist with this observation, we found that ubiquitination of Crk-L was also abrogated by coexpression with the Cbl-b WA or CA mutant (Fig. 2B). To determine a physiological role of Cbl-b in Crk-L ubiquitination, we examined whether Cbl-b deficiency affects Ub conjugation to Crk-L. Primary lymph node T cells from wild-type or Cbl-b–/– mice were either untreated or stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody. Anti-Crk-L immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-Ub antibody. Stimulation of primary T cells induced ubiquitination of Crk-L in wild-type T cells (Fig. 2C). However, Ub conjugation to Crk-L was reduced in Cbl-b–/– T cells under the same stimulation conditions. As previously described, ubiquitination of p85 of PI3K by Cbl-b does not cause p85 degradation (10Fang D. Liu Y.-C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 870-875Google Scholar). To examine whether Cbl-b affects the stability of Crk-L, we stimulated primary T cells from wild-type and Cbl-b–/– mice with anti-CD3 antibody for different time periods. It was found that Crk-L is a very stable protein (Fig. 3A). No apparent change in Crk-L protein level was observed even after 6-h stimulation. Cbl-b deficiency did not affect the protein level of Crk-L, as compared with wild-type T cells. The same membrane was blotted with antibodies against C3G, Zap-70, Fyn, Lck, and Grb2. There was no discernable difference in the protein levels of these proteins before or after anti-CD3 stimulation of T cells from wild-type and Cbl-b–/– mice. To further confirm that Cbl-b deficiency does not affect the protein stability of Crk-L, we performed pulse-chase experments (14Fang D. Elly C. Gao B. Fang N. Altman Y. Joazeiro C. Hunter T. Copeland N. Jenkins N. Liu Y.C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 281-287Google Scholar) in which primary T cells were labeled first with [35S]methionine, and the stability of the radiolabeled Crk-L was traced by immunoprecipitation at different time intervals after initial labeling. We found that the half-life of Crk-L was quite similar in both cell populations (Fig. 3B). As a positive control, we traced the half-life of IκBα, a well known protein that goes through proteasome-dependent degradation. IκBα has a very short half-life, which was not affected by Cbl-b deficiency (Fig. 3B, bottom panel). The data reinforce our previous observation that Cbl-b exerts its E3 ligase activity toward its substrates without apparent proteolysis (10Fang D. Liu Y.-C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 870-875Google Scholar). A recent study documented that stimulation of T cells with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus CD28 induces self-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Cbl-b (16Zhang J. Bardos T. Li D. Gal I. Vermes C. Xu J. Mikecz K. Finnegan A. Lipkowitz S. Glant T.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2236-2240Google Scholar). We found, however, that stimulation of primary T cells with anti-CD3 for longer time (9–18 h) resulted in an increase of Cbl-b protein in these cells (Fig. 3C). Costimulation with anti-CD28 did not reduce Cbl-b protein expression. The anti-CD3-induced Cbl-b expression was prominent, since blotting of the same lysates with other signaling molecules such as Cbl, Zap-70, Crk-L, or Lck did not show, or showed only slightly, changes in their protein amounts (Fig. 3C). Enhanced Crk-L and C3G Association and Rap-1 Activation in Cbl-b–/–T Cells—Next, we investigated whether Cbl-b deficiency affects the adaptor's function of Crk-L. Crk-L associates with C3G through the SH3 domain in Crk-L and the proline-rich sequences in C3G (12Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Google Scholar). We found that this association was constitutive in primary T cells, without obvious change upon TCR stimulation (Fig. 4A, top panel). However, the interaction between Crk-L and C3G was markedly increased in Cbl-b–/– T cells, under both resting and anti-CD3 stimulated conditions. It was also reported that Crk-L associates with Zap-70 in an activation-dependent manner in Jurkat T cells (17Gelkop S. Isakov N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21519-21527Google Scholar). Similar results could be observed in primary T cells upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Fig. 4A, middle panel). This activation-dependent interaction between Crk-L and Zap-70 did not change in Cbl-b–/– T cells. This change in Crk-L-C3G association in Cbl-b–/– T cells was not due to the change in protein levels of Crk-L or C3G, since blotting of the cell lysates with respective antibodies showed equivalent amounts of Crk-L and C3G proteins (Fig. 3B). The increased interaction between Crk-L and C3G may affect the guanine exchange factor activity of C3G. It is known that C3G is a specific guanine exchange factor for Rap1 (12Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Google Scholar). Rap1 is present in a GDP-bond form, and when activated, becomes a GTP-bound form. To examine the Rap1 activation in T cells, we employed a pull-down assay in which only the activated Rap1 can be recognized by a GST fusion protein containing RBD (18Amsen D. Kruisbeek A. Bos J.L. Reedquist K. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2832-2841Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, GST-RBD specifically precipitates Rap1 from primary T cells. Stimulation of the cells with anti-CD3 increased the amounts of activated Rap1. GST-RBD precipitated more Rap1 in resting Cbl-b–/– T cells, in comparison with wild-type T cells and the activated Rap1 was further increased upon anti-CD3 stimulation in Cbl-b–/– T cells. Blotting the cell lysates with anti-Rap1 antibody showed similar amounts of Rap1. The result suggests that Cbl-b is a negative regulator for Rap1 activation. Increased LFA-1 Activity in Cbl-b–/–T Cells—A recent study using Rap1 transgenic mice showed that Rap1 positively regulates cell adhesion through activating LFA-1 activity in T cells (19Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Google Scholar). The increased Rap1 activation in Cbl-b–/– T cells prompted us to examine whether Cbl-b deficiency affects Rap1-mediated LFA-1 activation. To test this possibility, we examined the cell adhesion of primary T cells from wild-type and Cbl-b–/– mice to plate-bound ICAM-1-Fc protein. We found that T cells from Cbl-b–/– mice displayed increased attachment to ICAM-1-Fc, but not to BSA, as compared with wild-type T cells under both resting and anti-CD3 stimulated conditions (Fig. 5A). The difference in ICAM-1 binding is not due to the differential cell surface expression of LFA-1, as revealed by the equivalent amounts of anti-LFA-1 staining in T cell populations from control and Cbl-b–/– mice (Fig. 5B). To further confirm that Cbl-b deficiency affects the binding ability of LFA-1 to ICAM-1, we performed FACS analysis on wild-type and Cbl-b–/– T cells using ICAM-1-Fc as a probe. The numbers of ICAM-1-Fc positive T cells were increased in both resting and anti-CD3 stimulated Cbl-b–/– T cells (Fig. 5C). Thus, Cbl-b deficiency increases LFA-1 activity, most likely through regulating Rap1 signaling. Increased LFA-1 Clustering in Cbl-b–/–T Cells—It is established that engagement of T cells with antigen-presenting cells in the presence of antigenic peptide induces membrane clustering of TCR complex and accessory molecules (20Bromley S.K. Burack W.R. Johnson K.G. Somersalo K. Sims T.N. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 375-396Google Scholar, 21Krummel M.F. Davis M.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 66-74Google Scholar). LFA-1 is one of such molecules that are recruited to the membrane microdomain, which is critical for T cell activation and adhesion (22Wulfing C. Sjaastad M.D. Davis M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6302-6307Google Scholar, 23Chiang S.H. Baumann C.A. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Watson R.T. Neudauer C.L. Macara I.G. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2001; 410: 944-948Google Scholar). The increased binding of Cbl-b–/– T cells to ICAM-1 suggests that Cbl-b deficiency may also affect LFA-1 clustering. To investigate this possibility, we examined the formation of LFA-1 aggregates in purified CD4+ T cells by cross-linking of the TCR with hamster anti-CD3 antibody, followed by secondary anti-hamster antibody. Although resting T cells showed uniformed staining to anti-LFA antibody around the cell surfaces, cross-linking of TCR resulted in the formation of LFA-1 clustering on T cell surface (Fig. 6A). When compared with wild-type T cells, Cbl-b–/– T cells showed more intense LFA-1 patches under anti-CD3 stimulated conditions. Under anti-CD3-stimulated condition, about 50% of the total T cells showed LFA-1 clustering in wild-type T cells (Fig. 6B). The number of LFA-1 patches was increased to 80% under the same stimulated conditions. The result suggests that Cbl-b is involved in T cell adhesion by regulating LFA-1 aggregation and activation. In the present study, we presented data showing that Cbl-b acts as an E3 Ub ligase for Crk-L. Cbl-b promotes ubiquitination of Crk-L without affecting its stability. Rather, Cbl-b deficiency results in an increased association between Crk-L and C3G, which leads to augmented activation of Rap1, and subsequent enhancement of LFA-1 activation. The results suggest that Cbl-b plays a negative role in Crk-L-C3G signaling pathway in response to TCR stimulation. We have previously demonstrated that Cbl-b regulates p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K in an E3 ligase-dependent, proteolysis-independent manner (9Fang D. Wang H.-Y. Fang N. Altman Y. Elly C. Liu Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4872-4878Google Scholar, 10Fang D. Liu Y.-C. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 870-875Google Scholar). Cbl-b-induced ubiquitination of p85 modulates its association with upstream molecules such as TCR subunits and CD28. The increased association between Crk-L and C3G in Cbl-b–/– T cells, as demonstrated in the present study, most likely results from the reduced Crk-L ubiquitination by Cbl-b deficiency, and the data further supports a notion that the Ub ligase activity of Cbl-b is uncoupled to the proteasome-dependent degradation of its substrates. At present, the molecular mechanisms by which Ub conjugation to a substrate modulates its biological function remain unclear. We propose that by helping tagging Ub to a substrate, Cbl-b may cause a structural change of its substrates, which may lead to a hindrance of their capability to recruit other binding molecules. It should be noted that the modification of Crk-L and C3G binding in Cbl-b–/– T cells is specific, since Cbl-b deficiency does not affect the association of Crk-L with Zap-70. It can be postulated that Ub conjugation to Crk-L may reside in the SH3 domains, which are required for C3G binding, not in the Zap-70-interacting SH2 domain. It was recently reported that Cbl-b goes through self-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, which is proposed to be a mechanism for Cbl-b-mediated T cell regulation (16Zhang J. Bardos T. Li D. Gal I. Vermes C. Xu J. Mikecz K. Finnegan A. Lipkowitz S. Glant T.T. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2236-2240Google Scholar). Although the present study did not address this issue directly, we found that stimulation of primary T cells with anti-CD3 did not affect the stability of Cbl-b. In contrast, anti-CD3 stimulation of primary T cells for longer period (9–18 h) increased the protein expression of Cbl-b, but not its homologue, Cbl. In addition, further costimulation with anti-CD28 did not cause a decrease of Cbl-b protein amount in these cells. Thus, our result does not support a critical role of Cbl-b self-ubiquitination in T cell regulation. The increased protein expression of Cbl-b in T cells after longer time stimulation may instead point out a novel negative feedback mechanism, i.e. TCR engagement not only triggers Cbl-b-mediated ubiquitination pathway to help terminate the activation signal, but also increases Cbl-b protein expression to counter-balance the sustained T cell activation. This mechanism may be particularly important in the development of autoimmne diseases in which a chronic and sustained T cell activation is required for the breakdown of T cell tolerance. To support this hypothesis, it was reported that Cbl-b deficiency results in spontaneous autoimmunity or increased immune response to autoantigens (7Bachmaier K. Krawczyk C. Kozieradzki I. Kong Y.Y. Sasaki T. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Mariathasan S. Bouchard D. Wakeham A. Itie A. Le J. Ohashi P.S. Sarosi I. Nishina H. Lipkowitz S. Penninger J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 211-216Google Scholar, 8Chiang Y.J. Kole H.K. Brown K. Naramura M. Fukuhara S. Hu R.J. Jang I.K. Gutkind J.S. Shevach E. Gu H. Nature. 2000; 403: 216-220Google Scholar). Previous studies have documented a positive role of Cbl in Crk-L-C3G-mediated signaling (13Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Google Scholar, 24Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 85-94Google Scholar). In these studies, Cbl was proposed to be an adaptor protein, which helps recruit Crk-L and C3G to form an activation complex for Rap1. In Jurkat T cells, it was shown that engagement of TCR induces Fyn activation and subsequent Cbl phosphorylation, which leads to Cbl-Crk-L association. Since Crk-L constitutively associates with C3G, it then catalyzes the conversion of the inactive GDP-bond Rap1 to the active GTP bond Rap1 (13Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Google Scholar). We have recently revisited this issue by analyzing the activation of Rap1 in Cbl–/– thymocytes. We found that Cbl deficiency augmented TCR-induced Rap1 activation, which was further supported by increased association of Crk-L with C3G and C3G membrane translocation (15Shao Y. Elly C. Liu Y.C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 425-431Google Scholar). Our results indicate that Cbl is a negative regulator in Crk-L-C3G signaling. Here, we provided further evidence that Cbl-b, like Cbl, also plays a negative role in Rap1 activation in peripheral mature T cells. Thus, the data suggest a new paradigm on a functional role of Cbl proteins (Cbl/Cbl-b) in the negative regulation of Crk-L-C3G-mediated pathways. Engagement of TCR results in rapid activation of Ras, another member of small GTPases, which is essential for T cell proliferation and cytokine production (25Genot E. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 289-294Google Scholar). One of the well established pathway tranduced by Ras is Raf/Mek/Erk cascade (25Genot E. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 289-294Google Scholar). Both Ras and Rap1 have a nearly identical effector domain. However, binding of Rap1 to Raf does not cause Raf activation. Rather Rap1 competes with Ras for Raf interaction and antagonizes Ras/Raf/Erk signaling (26Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Google Scholar). Particularly, in anergized T cells that show decreased Ras and Erk activation (27Li W. Whaley C.D. Mondino A. Mueller D.L. Science. 1996; 271: 1272-1276Google Scholar, 28Fields P.E. Gajewski T.F. Fitch F.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1276-1278Google Scholar), the activation of Rap1 is increased (13Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Google Scholar). In addition, the activation of Fyn and Cbl-Crk-L complex formation is also increased. It is therefore proposed that Fyn-Cbl-Crk-L complex formation is responsible for Rap1 activation and T cell anergy induction (13Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Google Scholar). Although we did not address whether Cbl-b is involved in anergic signaling, our data rather suggest an opposite role for Cbl-b in Rap1 signaling. To further contrast with a negative role of Rap1 in Ras activation in T cells, a recent study using Rap1 trangenic mice showed that Rap1 does not interfere with Raf/Erk signaling (19Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Google Scholar). In Rap1 transgenic T cells, the activation of integrins is increased, which is evidenced by enhanced cell adhesion and LFA-1 clustering (19Sebzda E. Bracke M. Tugal T. Hogg N. Cantrell D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 251-258Google Scholar). In addition, Rap1 has also been shown to mediate CD31-induced integrin activation (29Reedquist K.A. Ross E. Koop E.A. Wolthuis R.M. Zwartkruis F.J. van Kooyk Y. Salmon M. Buckley C.D. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1151-1158Google Scholar). Inspired by these findings, we also examined T cell adhesion events and found that Cbl-b–/– T cells display a similar phenotype as Rap1 transgenic T cells. Thus, our data consist with a role of Rap1 in integrin-induced cell adhesion. It should be noted that Cbl-b also affects other signal molecules, such as Vav and PI3K, and these molecules are also involved in integrin signaling (30Krawczyk C. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Sasaki T. Griffiths E. Ohashi P.S. Snapper S. Alt F. Penninger J.M. Immunity. 2002; 16: 331-343Google Scholar). Thus, the increased cell binding to ICAM-1 and LFA-1 aggregation in Cbl-b–/– T cells may reflect an integration of several signaling pathways. Obviously, further studies are needed to dissect the respective role of these pathways in Cbl-b-mediated integrin regulation. We thank A. Altman and our colleagues at the Division of Cell Biology for support and discussion, M. Naramura and H. Gu for providing Cbl-b–/– mice, and J. Bos for reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2050781188,"<i>BRCA1</i> is a tumor suppressor gene mutated in cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 protein is involved in apoptosis and growth/tumor suppression. In this study, we present evidence that p65/RelA, one of the two subunits of the transcription factor NF-κB, binds to the BRCA1 protein. Treatment of 293T cells with the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α induces an interaction between endogenous p65/RelA and BRCA1. GST-protein affinity assay experiments reveal that the Rel homology domain of the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB interacts with multiple sites within the N-terminal region of BRCA1. Transient transfection of BRCA1 significantly enhances the ability of the tumor necrosis factor-α or interleukin-1β to activate transcription from the promoters of NF-κB target genes. Mutation of the NF-κB-binding sites in the NF-κB reporter blocks the effect of BRCA1 on transcription. Also the ability of BRCA1 to activate NF-κB target genes is inhibited by a super-stable inhibitor of NF-κB and by the chemical inhibitor SN-50. These data indicate that BRCA1 acts as a co-activator with NF-κB. In addition, we show that cells infected with an adenovirus expressing BRCA1 up-regulate the endogenous expression of NF-κB target genes <i>Fas</i> and interferon-β. Together, this information suggests that BRCA1 may play a role in cell life-death decisions following cell stress by modulation of the activity of NF-κB."
https://openalex.org/W2111467544,"The core histone tail domains are key regulators of eukaryotic chromatin structure and function and alterations in the tail-directed folding of chromatin fibers and higher order structures are the probable outcome of much of the post-translational modifications occurring in these domains. The functions of the tail domains are likely to involve complex intra- and inter-nucleosomal histone-DNA interactions, yet little is known about either the structures or interactions of these domains. Here we introduce a method for examining inter-nucleosome interactions of the tail domains in a model dinucleosome and determine the propensity of each of the four N-terminal tail domains to mediate such interactions in this system. Using a strong nucleosome “positioning” sequence, we reconstituted a nucleosome containing a single histone site specifically modified with a photoinducible cross-linker within the histone tail domain, and a second nucleosome containing a radiolabeled DNA template. These two nucleosomes were then ligated together and cross-linking induced by brief UV irradiation under various solution conditions. After cross-linking, the two templates were again separated so that cross-linking representing inter-nucleosomal histone-DNA interactions could be unambiguously distinguished from intra-nucleosomal cross-links. Our results show that the N-terminal tails of H2A and H2B, but not of H3 and H4, make internucleosomal histone-DNA interactions within the dinucleosome. The relative extent of intra- to inter-nucleosome interactions was not strongly dependent on ionic strength. Additionally, we find that binding of a linker histone to the dinucleosome increased the association of the H3 and H4 tails with the linker DNA region.

Additionally, we find that binding of a linker histone to the dinucleosome increased the association of the H3 and H4 tails with the linker DNA region. Within the basic repeating subunit of eukaryotic chromatin known as the nucleosome, the nucleosome core is comprised of two copies of each of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, and 147 bp of DNA. Approximately 75% of the core histone protein mass is organized into a “spool” onto which the nucleosome core DNA is tightly wrapped (1Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10489-10493Google Scholar, 2Arents G. Burlingame R.W. Wang B.C. Love W.E. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10148-10152Google Scholar). This spool is formed primarily by the histone fold motif within each protein and additional structural elements adjacent to these domains (1Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each nucleosome also includes a stretch of linker DNA, which joins nucleosome cores together in native chromatin, and, in most cases, a single linker histone (8van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer Verlag, New York1989Google Scholar). Arrays of nucleosomes are compacted into chromatin fibers of about 30 nm in diameter; these fibers are further condensed into poorly defined higher order structures (9Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Google Scholar, 10Belmont A.S. Bruce K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 287-302Google Scholar).About 25% of the total mass of the core histones is contained within the N-terminal tail domains, which were initially defined by their sensitivity to proteases (8van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer Verlag, New York1989Google Scholar, 11Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. Biosci. Rep. 1984; 4: 365-386Google Scholar). These domains are highly basic and bind DNA in vitro and in native chromatin (12Stefanovsky V. Dimitrov S.I. Russanova V.R. Angelov D. Pashev I.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10069-10081Google Scholar, 13Mutskov V. Gerber D. Angelov D. Ausio J. Workman J. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6293-6304Google Scholar, 14Hong L. Schroth G.P.

In addition, evidence suggests that these domains also participate in protein-protein interactions between histones in the fully condensed chromatin fiber (3Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Google Scholar, 7White C.L. Suto R.K. Luger K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5207-5218Google Scholar, 16Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25359-25362Google Scholar). Despite the perception of the tails as being “unstructured,” biochemical and biophysical studies indicate they adopt defined structures and make specific interactions in chromatin (17Baneres J.L. Martin A. Parello J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 503-508Google Scholar, 18Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8622-8628Google Scholar, 19Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The tail domains are not required for assembling or maintaining the structure of the nucleosome core and removal of the tails results in only marginal changes in the hydrodynamic shape, stability, and DNA wrapping within the nucleosome (21Ausio J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Google Scholar, 22Hayes J.J. Clark D.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6829-6833Google Scholar, 23Polach K.J. Lowary P.T. Widom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 211-233Google Scholar). However, the tail domains are essential for folding of oligonucleosomal arrays into native 30-nm chromatin fibers and are probably required for efficient assembly of fibers into higher order structures (9Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Google Scholar, 24Allan J. Harborne N. Rau D.C. Gould H. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 285-297Google Scholar, 25Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausio J. J.

Subsets of tails can promote partial folding capability and intermolecular association, suggesting that the tails have overlapping functions and the H4 tail appears to be the most critical for salt-dependent folding (27Tse C. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11381-11388Google Scholar, 28Moore S.C. Ausio J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 136-139Google Scholar, 29Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Google Scholar). However, the requirement for the tail domains, and particularly the H4 tail, for complete folding of oligonucleosomes into the fully folded chromatin fiber suggests the tails mediate specific molecular interactions during chromatin folding (9Hansen J.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 361-392Google Scholar, 16Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25359-25362Google Scholar, 29Dorigo B. Schalch T. Bystricky K. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 85-96Google Scholar). Although it has not been directly demonstrated, it is generally assumed that at least some of these interactions include inter-nucleosomal contacts (3Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F.

However, the complex array of structures and interactions of the tail domains in chromatin remains relatively undefined.In higher eukaryotes native chromatin also contains approximately one linker histone (histone H1) bound to each nucleosome (8van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer Verlag, New York1989Google Scholar, 30Bates D.L. Thomas J.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 2: 5883-5894Google Scholar). Nearly all linker histones contain an ∼80-amino acid residue protease-resistant globular domain that directs binding of these proteins to the exterior of the nucleosome (31Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X. Nature. 1980; 288: 675-679Google Scholar, 32Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-224Google Scholar). Although linker histones bind with high affinity and positive cooperativity to naked DNA, they exhibit preferential binding to reconstituted nucleosomes in vitro (33Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Google Scholar). This binding stabilizes the wrapping of DNA about the histone octamer and directs the association of an extremely basic ∼100 residue C-terminal tail that helps neutralize electrostatic repulsion caused by packing the polyanionic DNA backbone within the chromatin fiber (31Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Aviles F.X. Nature. 1980; 288: 675-679Google Scholar, 34Allan J. Mitchell T. Harborne N. Bohm L. Crane-Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 591-601Google Scholar, 35Clark D.J. Kimura T. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 883-896Google Scholar, 36Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Google Scholar). Thus linker histones generally stabilize the core histone tail-dependent intrinsic ability of nucleosome arrays to fold into chromatin fibers (36Carruthers L.M. Bednar J. Woodcock C.L. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14776-14787Google Scholar). Notably, it has been shown that the binding of linker histones can directly alter some of the interactions of the core histone tail domains within individual nucleosomes (18Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8622-8628Google Scholar, 37Guschin D. Chandler S. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8629-8636Google Scholar).Histone tails undergo numerous post-translational modifications, which either directly or indirectly alter chromatin structure to facilitate transcriptional activation or repression or other nuclear processes (38Bradbury E.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 9-16Google Scholar, 39Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Google Scholar, 40Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Google Scholar, 41Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar). Thus modifications within these domains are an end point to many signal-transduction pathways directed to the nucleus of the cell (42Schreiber S.L. Bernstein B.E. Cell. 2002; 111: 771-778Google Scholar). Whereas some modifications generate recognition sites for the binding of specific proteins such as the heterochromatin-associated protein HP1 to the tails (43Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Google Scholar, 44Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 410: 120-124Google Scholar), other modifications can directly alter chromatin structure (45Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A.P. Hansen J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Google Scholar, 46Garcia-Ramirez M. Rocchini C. Ausio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17923-17928Google Scholar). For example acetylation of lysine residues results in a reduction of positive charge and it has been demonstrated that mutation-based alterations in overall charge can mimic the essential function(s) of acetylation in a histone tail domain in vivo (47Ren Q. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1329-1335Google Scholar). This nonspecific charge effect is perhaps because of a reduced affinity or interaction of the tail with DNA in chromatin, leading to an alteration of chromatin structure. On the other hand, UV-laser cross-linking studies suggest that acetylation does not lead to a loss of tail-DNA interactions (13Mutskov V. Gerber D. Angelov D. Ausio J. Workman J. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6293-6304Google Scholar) and other critical post-translational modifications such as methylation do not lead to an alteration of overall charge in the tail domains. Thus some modifications are likely to directly evoke distinct changes in tail structures (48Hayes J.J. Hansen J.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 124-129Google Scholar). However, a detailed understanding of the mechanism(s) by which post-translational modifications of the histone tails leads to altered functional states of chromatin must await an understanding of the basic structures and interactions of the tail domains.Here we introduce a novel dinucleosome system for investigation of core histone tail-DNA interactions. This system allows unambiguous identification of intra- and inter-nucleosomal interactions between the histone tail domains and DNA under a variety of conditions, including those that induce folding of the linker DNA in dinucleosomes (49Yao J. Lowary P.T. Widom J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7603-7607Google Scholar, 50Yao J. Lowary P.T. Widom J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8408-8414Google Scholar, 51Butler P.J. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 401-407Google Scholar). We find that a subset of the tail domains contact the DNA of the adjacent nucleosome although the H3 and H4 tails appear to participate in only intra-nucleosomal interactions. Interestingly, the relative extent of inter-nucleosomal interactions does not exhibit a detectable dependence on ionic strength, but binding of a linker histone increases the association of H3 and H4 tails with the linker DNA region.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Fragments—DNA templates for nucleosomes 1 and 2 were derived from plasmid pXbs-1 containing a Xenopus borealis somatic 5 S rRNA gene (52Peterson R.C. Doering J.L. Brown D.D. Cell. 1980; 20: 131-141Google Scholar). PCR techniques were used to add HindIII and DraIII sites to the ends of the nucleosome 1 DNA template using primers 5′-CAGTAAGCTTGATTCCCGGGCTTGTTTTCCTGCCTG-3′ and 5′-CATGTCTAGAGATCCCGGGACTACACGAGGTCCCATCCAAGTAC-3′ and DraIII and XbaI sites to nucleosome 2 using primers 5′-CAGTAAGCTTGATTCACCTCGTGCTTGTTTTCCTGCCTG-3′ and 5′-CATGTCTAGAGATCCCGGGACTACGGTCTCCCATCCAAGTAC-3′ (Fig. 1). The resulting nucleosome 1 is 205 bp, and nucleosome 2 is 209 bp. Ligation of the two templates at the asymmetric DraIII site creates a tandem repeat of 5 S sequences with a repeat of 210 bp. The two templates were cloned into pBluescript plasmids pBSXN1 and pB-SXN2. DNA fragments from each were prepared in large quantity by first digesting 10 mg of pBSXN1 or pBSXN2 with HindIII or XbaI, respectively, dephosphorylation with calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs), and filling in the 5′ overhang with Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of 100 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, and ddCTP for pBSXN1 or dCTP, dTTP, dGTP, and ddATP for BSNX2. The plasmid was then cut with DraIII and the released template DNAs isolated on preparative 1.2% agarose gels, and recovered by electroelution. Following phenol extraction and repeated ethanol precipitation, the pellet was dissolved in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and stored frozen at –20 °C until needed. For each dinucleosome reconstitution radioactively labeled nucleosome templates 1 or 2 were prepared by digesting 10 mg of either parent plasmid with HindIII or XbaI, respectively. The free DNA ends were dephosphorylated as above and the DNA was stored frozen. For each labeling 100 μg of either digested plasmid was incubated with Klenow in the presence of 500 μCi of [α-32P]dATP, and 100 μm each of dGTP, dTTP, and ddCTP ([α-32P]dCTP, dTTP, dGTP, and ddATP for pBSXN2) for 15 min at room temperature, then 100 μm cold dATP (dCTP for pBSXN2) was added for an additional 10 min. The labeled template was isolated on a 6% acrylamide gel by standard techniques and stored in TE.Preparation of Native and APB-modified Histones—Recombinant wild type and mutant H2A, H2B, H2A-G2C, and H2B-2C were prepared and purified as preformed dimers as described (19Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8959-8964Google Scholar, 53Hayes J.J. Lee K.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Google Scholar). Coding sequences for Xenopus H3-T6C/C110A (containing cysteine and alanine codon substitutions at amino acid positions 6 and 110, respectively) and H4-G6C (containing a cysteine codon at position 6) were constructed and cloned into pET3 expression plasmids. The individual core histones and mutant proteins were expressed individually in bacteria and then H2A/H2B dimers were purified as described previously (53Hayes J.J. Lee K.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Google Scholar) and H3/H4 tetramers were prepared via the following procedure. As these proteins were present in insoluble forms in traditionally prepared lysates, we first determined the mass of proteins within each bacterial cell culture and then mixed cultures containing roughly equal amounts of H3 and H4, H3-T6C/C110A and H4, or H3-C110A and H4-G6C. A pellet containing both proteins (from one combined liter of culture) was suspended in 100 ml of P1 buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml RNase, pH 8.0), and then cells were lysed with an equal volume of P2′ buffer (0.2 m NaOH, 0.4% Triton X-100) in the presence of 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature for an hour. The lysate was dialyzed against 2 m NaCl, TE buffer (pH 8.0, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C for at least 16 h, with three buffer exchanges. The sample was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet discarded. For each 10 ml of supernatant 30 ml of TE and 100 μl of 1 m dithiothreitol were added, then 1 ml of exchange resin was added per ml of solution (Bio-Rex 70, 50–100 mesh, 50% slurry). Proteins were allowed to bind the resin for 4 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed extensively with 0.6 m NaCl in TE and H3/H4 tetramer was eluted with 2 m NaCl in TE. Fractions containing the tetramer were sonicated to reduce the size of contaminating nucleic acids and the Bio-Rex resin purification was repeated. The fractions containing H3/H4 tetramers were mixed with 50 μl of hydroxyapatite resin per ml (Bio-Rad, 50% slurry) for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resin was removed by centrifugation. This process was repeated 3 times to eliminate final traces of contaminating nucleic acids (54Simon R.H. Felsenfeld G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 689-696Google Scholar). The proteins were checked by SDS-PAGE and trial reconstitutions. APB modification of H2A-G2C, H2B-2C, H3-T6C, and H4-G6C was carried out as previously described (19Lee K.M. Hayes J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8959-8964Google Scholar, 55Lee K.M. Chafin D.R. Hayes J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 231-251Google Scholar).Preparation of Model Dinucleosomes—Nucleosomes 1 and 2 were prepared separately and then ligated together. In most cases one nucleosome was reconstituted on a cold DNA template and the second reconstituted on a radioactively end-labeled template prepared as described above. Nucleosome reconstitution was carried out by a standard salt dialysis procedure (53Hayes J.J. Lee K.M. Methods. 1997; 12: 2-9Google Scholar). Typically, 6.6 μg of unlabeled or ∼3 μg of labeled template fragment, respectively, mixed with 15 μg of H2A/H2B, 15 μg of H3/H4, and 40 μg of linearized Bluescript plasmid with blunt ends (as competitor) were used for each reconstitution. Because of slight variations in different preparations of DNA fragments and APB-modified histone mutants, the ideal ratio was empirically determined. Reconstituted mononucleosomes were loaded onto 10 ml of 5–20% sucrose gradients prepared in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA (Beckman 41 Ti rotor, 34 krpm, 18 h). Fractions containing purified mononucleosomes were identified by analysis in 0.7% agarose nucleoprotein gels. The nucleosome fractions were concentrated 10-fold by centrifugation through a Microcon YM-50 filter membrane. The ligation reactions typically contained 50 μl (5 or 2.5 pmol of unlabeled or labeled nucleosomes, respectively) each of nucleosomes 1 and 2, 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 3,200 units of T4 ligase (New England Biolabs) were kept at room temperature for 30 min in a total volume of 160 μl, followed by the addition of 20 μl of 10 mm ATP and 20 μl of 20 mm Mg2+ for an additional 60 min. The ligation product was purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation as above except for 15 h at 4 °C.Restriction Enzyme Digestion and Hydroxyl Radical Footprinting of Nucleosomes—Sucrose gradient-purified mononucleosomes and dinucleosomes were subjected to restriction enzyme digestion as described (56Vitolo J.M. Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2167-2175Google Scholar). Dinucleosomes used for hydroxyl radical footprinting were first subjected to buffer exchange to 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA on a Microcon YM-50 concentrator to eliminate sucrose.UV-induced Cross-linking and Identification of Cross-linking Bands—Gradient-purified dinucleosomes were subjected to buffer exchange as above, and then 32 μl (∼0.1 pmol) was rapidly mixed with 4μl of bovine serum albumin (1 μg/μl), and 4 μl of concentrated NaCl solutions. The mixture was placed into the bottom of a Falcon 5-ml polystyrene tube, which was inside a 15-ml Pyrex 9820 glass tube. The sample was irradiated with 365 nm UV light generated by a VMR LM-20E light box for 1 min. The sample was then mixed with 5 μl of 1M dithiothreitol, 2 μl of 10% SDS, 2 μl of 1.5 μg/μl calf thymus DNA, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by adding 85 μl of ddH2O and standard ethanol precipitation. The pellet was dissolved in 30 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and then 13 μl of the sample was digested with DraIII, in a total volume of 30 μl at 37 °C for 3 h. Another 13-μl portion was diluted to 30 μl with ddH2O and mock-digested at 37 °C for the same time. The samples then mixed with SDS and loaded onto a 6% acrylamide gel containing Tris-glycine-SDS buffer and run at 100 V for 14 h before gel drying and PhosphorImager analysis.RESULTSAssembly of the Dinucleosome—To assess potential internucleosomal interactions of the core histone tail domains, we assembled a model dinucleosome in which one nucleosome contained native histones and a radiolabeled DNA fragment while the second contained one histone with a photoactivatable cross-linking probe located within the tail domain. To assemble the dinucleosome, the two individually reconstituted nucleosomes were ligated together (Fig. 1). To ensure proper orientation upon ligation, we placed an asymmetric recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme DraIII at appropriate ends of the DNA templates (Fig. 1) and polished the opposite ends (filled in with a terminal dideoxynucleotide and dephosphorylated) to prevent self-ligation (see “Experimental Procedures”; Fig. 2A). We found that efficient ligation of the radioactive nucleosome required this nucleosome to be present with at least 10 nm concentration and a 2–3-fold excess of the unlabeled nucleosome (Fig. 2). Ligated dinucleosomes were isolated by centrifugation through sucrose gradients to remove any unligated material or material not containing a full complement of core histones.Fig. 2Assembly of the model dinucleosome.A, proper ligation of template DNAs. Ligation reactions (total volume of 10 μl in 1× T4 ligase buffer) were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and then loaded onto a 6% acrylamide gel. Samples shown in lanes 1 and 2 contained no ligase, whereas those in lanes 3–5 contained 400 units of T4 DNA ligase. Samples shown in lanes 1 and 3 contained 0.1 μg of nucleosome 1 template (N1); lanes 2 and 5, 0.2 μg of nucleosome template 2 (N2); lane 4, 0.1 μg of N1 and 0.2 μg of N2. B, mononucleosomes were efficiently ligated into dinucleosomes. In this experiment nucleosome 1 was radioactively labeled and samples were run in a 0.7% agarose nucleoprotein gel. Lane 1, mononucleosome DNA; lane 2, gradient purified mononucleosome 1; lane 3, ligated dinucleosome DNA; lanes 4 and 5, nucleoprotein products from the ligation reaction before and after gradient purification of the dinucleosome, respectively. C, two H1s bind model dinucleosomes. Gradient-purified dinucleosomes were incubated with histone H1 and then products were resolved on a 0.7% agarose nucleoprotein gel. Lane 1, dinucleosome DNA template shown as a control; lane 2, gradient-purified dinucleosomes; lanes 3–6, dinucleosomes incubated with 4.0, 2.0, 1.5, and 1.0 mol of H1/mol of dinucleosome, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Characterization of the Model Dinucleosome—Purified ligated dinucleosomes migrate through sucrose gradients and in agarose gels as expected based on migration of mononucleosomes and native dinucleosome controls (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Also, similar to other dinucleosomes (57Ura K. Hayes J.J. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3752-3765Google Scholar), our ligated dinucleosome showed a two-step shift when bound by increasing amounts of histone H1 (Fig. 2C). To further check integrity, gradient-purified dinucleosomes were subjected to hydroxyl radical footprinting and restriction enzyme digestion assays. By labeling different ends of the dinucleosome, we compared the hydroxyl radical footprinting patterns of each end of the template with the respective mononucleosomes. As shown in Fig. 3, the cleavage patterns from nucleosomes 1 and 2 in the model dinucleosome were very similar to corresponding mononucleosomes, indicating that the ligation process did not alter nucleosome rotational orientation or position or select for minor populations of mononucleosomes with alternative positioning. Mapping of nucleosome positions in the mono and model dinucleosome via restriction enzyme site protection assays substantiated the footprinting results (Fig. 4). Again, the extents of protection at each site in the mono- and dinucleosomes were similar, indicating the mononucleosome positions were not significantly altered when ligated into dinucleosomes.Fig. 3Hydroxyl radical footprinting of model mono- and dinucleosomes. Radioactively labeled nucleosomes and naked DNA were prepared, subjected to hydroxyl radical cleavage, and the products were analyzed in sequencing gels.

The two conformers constituting each aggregated species were assayed for their antitumor, aspermatogenic, or embryotoxic activities in comparison with monomeric RNase A and bovine seminal RNase, which is dimeric in nature. The antitumor action was tested in vitro on ML-2 (human myeloid leukemia) and HL-60 (human myeloid cell line) cells and in vivo on the growth of human non-pigmented melanoma (line UB900518) transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice. RNase A oligomers display a definite antitumor activity that increases as a function of the size of the oligomers. On ML-2 and HL-60 cells, dimers and trimers generally show a lower activity than bovine seminal RNase; the activity of tetramers, instead, is similar to or higher than that of the seminal enzyme. The growth of human melanoma in nude mice is inhibited by RNase A oligomers in the order dimers < trimers < tetramers. The action of the two tetramers is very strong, blocking almost completely the growth of melanoma. RNase A dimers, trimers, and tetramers display aspermatogenic effects similar to those of bovine seminal RNase, but, contrarily, they do not show any embryotoxic activity.

Bovine ribonuclease A oligomerizes in the forms of dimers (1Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 1: 217-222Google Scholar), trimers, tetramers, and higher order oligomers (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar) during lyophilization from 40% acetic acid solutions. Each oligomer consists of two conformational isomers, which can be separated by cation exchange chromatography into a less basic and a more basic species (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar, 3Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Google Scholar). The molecular structures of the two dimers have been solved (4Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3437-3442Google Scholar, 5Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Google Scholar). They form by a three-dimensional domain-swapping mechanism (6Bennet M.J. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1444-1463Google Scholar); the less basic dimer, formerly named minor because of its ratio of 1:4 to the more basic dimer (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar, 3Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Google Scholar, 5Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Google Scholar), is formed by the swapping of the N-terminal α-helix (residues 1–15) of each monomeric subunit, and the more basic or major dimer (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar, 3Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Google Scholar, 5Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Google Scholar) is formed by the swapping of the C-terminal β-strand (residues 116–124) of each monomer. On this basis, the two dimers will be called N-dimer and C-dimer, respectively. The structure of the more basic or minor trimer (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar, 3Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Google Scholar) has also been solved; it is formed by three monomers linked to each other by swapping their C-terminal β-strands, thereby forming a circular structure that looks like a propeller (7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Google Scholar). It will be called the C-trimer in this paper. On the basis of its dissociation products (3Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Google Scholar, 7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Google Scholar), a plausible linear model was proposed for the less basic, major trimer (its abundance is 1.5 times that of the more basic, minor trimer). In this linear model, two monomers are linked through swapping of their N termini, and a third monomer is bound to one of them by C-terminal domain swapping (5Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Google Scholar, 7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Google Scholar). It will be called the NC-trimer. Two linear structures for the two tetramers, the less basic minor and the more basic major (ratio, 1:1.6), have also been proposed on the basis of their dissociation products (3Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Google Scholar, 8Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Google Scholar). The first could consist of a central dimer formed by C-terminal swapping, each monomer of which is linked to another monomer by N-terminal swapping. The second model could have the opposite structure, i.e. a central dimer joined by swapped N termini connected to two more monomers by the C-terminal domain-swapping mechanism. Here, they will be called the NCN-tetramer and the CNC-tetramer, respectively. These models fit the ion exchange chromatographic behavior of the two tetramers. Moreover, two additional different structures have been proposed for the RNase A tetramers by Liu and Eisenberg (8Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Google Scholar). All RNase A oligomers, having composite active sites (His-12, His-119, and Lys-41), are enzymatically active (1Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 1: 217-222Google Scholar, 2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar, 7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Google Scholar, 9Libonati M. Bertoldi M. Sorrentino S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 287-290Google Scholar). Their specific activities show a 30–50% reduction on yeast RNA or poly(C) substrates compared with monomeric RNase A (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar, 9Libonati M. Bertoldi M. Sorrentino S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 287-290Google Scholar). Although native RNase A is inactive on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) 1The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; BS-RNase, bovine seminal RNase; cRI, cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor. 1The abbreviations used are: dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; BS-RNase, bovine seminal RNase; cRI, cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor. substrates under standard assay conditions (10Libonati M. Sorrentino S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 234-248Google Scholar), its oligomers show a remarkable depolymerizing activity on dsRNA. The extent of degradation of this RNA species increases in going from dimers to pentamers, and between each pair of same-sized oligomers, the ability to attack dsRNA is always higher for the more basic conformer (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar, 7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Google Scholar, 9Libonati M. Bertoldi M. Sorrentino S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 287-290Google Scholar). This activity is interpreted as being due to an initial destabilization of the nucleic acid secondary structure induced by the positive charges of the RNase molecule, i.e. transient single-stranded RNA stretches would form that become susceptible to ribonuclease attack (10Libonati M. Sorrentino S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 234-248Google Scholar). A correlation has indeed been found between the number of positive charges present in the active site region of mammalian pancreatic type ribonucleases and their ability to degrade dsRNA, as well as between the basic charge “density” of the RNase A oligomers and their activity toward dsRNA (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar, 7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Google Scholar, 9Libonati M. Bertoldi M. Sorrentino S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 287-290Google Scholar, 10Libonati M. Sorrentino S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 234-248Google Scholar). Recently, it was also shown that the efficiency of dsRNA degradation by the RNase A dimers increases under the following conditions: (i) as the distance between the active sites of the dimer decreases (which has the effect of increasing the positive charges density at the active site region); and (ii) as the orientation of the two RNA-binding patches of the oligomeric enzyme is more twisted around the molecules (7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Google Scholar). These parameters also hold for the C-trimer and the bovine seminal RNase (BS-RNase) (7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Google Scholar), a dimeric basic protein (pI, 10.3) having 83% sequence identity with RNase A (11Dostàl J. Matousek J. J. Reprod.

Floridi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 8: 81-87Google Scholar). BS-RNase is also endowed with several biological actions; its aspermatogenic, embryotoxic, immunosuppressive (15Dostàl J. Matousek J. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 106-109Google Scholar) activities have been extensively studied over the years. A strong antitumor action is also exerted by onconase, a ribonuclease purified from Rana pipiens oocytes (22Boix E. Wu Y. Vasandani V.M. Saxena S.K. Ardelt W. Ladner J. Youle R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 992-1007Google Scholar). The lack of any significant biological activity in monomeric RNase A, and, on the contrary, the presence of various, remarkable biological actions in dimeric BS-RNase could reasonably be, at least partly, ascribed to the different quaternary structures of the two protein molecules. In fact, whereas the cytosolic ribonuclease inhibitor (cRI) (23Blackburn P. Moore S. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 15. Academic Press, New York1982: 317-433Google Scholar, 24Lee F.S. Vallee B.L. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 1-30Google Scholar, 25Hofsteenge J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 807-809Google Scholar) can block monomeric RNase A after its entrance into the cell, BS-RNase, because of its dimeric structure, would escape interaction with the inhibitor and therefore be able to exert its enzymatic activity in the cell (26Kim J.-S. Soucek J. Matousek J. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31097-31102Google Scholar, 27Antignani A. Naddeo M. Cubellis M.V. Russo A. D'Alessio G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3492-3496Google Scholar). Based on these facts and taking into account that a significant activity against transformed cells was also shown to be displayed in vitro and in vivo by RNase A dimerized by protein engineering (28Di Donato A. Cafaro V. D'Alessio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17394-17396Google Scholar), covalently cross-linked dimers and trimers of RNase A (29Bartholeyns J. Baudhuin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 573-576Google Scholar, 30Tarnowsky G.S. Kassel R.L. Mountain I.M. Blackburn P. Wilson G. Wang D. Cancer Res. 1976; 36: 4074-4078Google Scholar, 31Gotte G. Testolin L. Costanzo C. Sorrentino S. Armato U. Libonati M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 308-312Google Scholar), and a dimeric mutant of human pancreatic RNase (32Piccoli R. Di Gaetano S. De Lorenzo C. Grauso M. Monaco C. Spalletti-Cernia D. Laccetti P. Cinatl J. Matousek J. D'Alessio G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7768-7773Google Scholar), the question arose as to whether the various RNase A oligomers obtained by the lyophilization procedure and purified as described (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar) might also be endowed with similar biological actions. We have therefore performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, which demonstrate that RNase A dimers, trimers, and tetramers display aspermatogenic and antitumor activities that increase remarkably as a function of the oligomer mass and, at the same time, show a complete lack of embryotoxicity. Preparation of RNase A Oligomers—Dimers, trimers, and tetramers of RNase A (Type XII-A, purchased from Sigma) were prepared by lyophilization of the protein from 40% acetic acid solutions, as described (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar). The lyophilized material, dissolved in 0.08 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography with a Source 15S HR 16/10 or 16/50 column in a fast paced liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (Amersham Biosciences). Separation of the various RNase A species, at room temperature, was performed at pH 6.7 using a 0.085–0.18 m sodium phosphate gradient with the 16/10 column (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar) or a 0.09–0.20 m sodium phosphate gradient with the 16/50 column. The aggregates, if not used immediately, were kept diluted and frozen until use. In fact, the stability of the RNase A aggregates in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, is definitely higher at low protein concentration (3Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Google Scholar). The concentration of RNase A was estimated spectrophotometrically using ϵ2801% = 7.3 (33Wang D. Moore S. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2937-2942Google Scholar). Bovine Seminal RNase—Bovine seminal ribonuclease was isolated from bull seminal plasma obtained from healthy, sexually mature bulls bred in the Litohor insemination station (Litohor, Czech Republic). To isolate the enzyme, one volume of the seminal plasma was diluted with 2.5 volumes of 2% acetic acid. The protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant up to 3 m concentration. After another centrifugation, the new supernatant was then dialyzed using the Vivaflow 50 linked module flow system (Vivascience Ltd., Stonehouse, UK) and freeze-dried. Chromatographies with CM Sephadex C-50 and Sephadex G-100 columns, respectively, were used for complete purification (34Matousek J. Anim. Genet. 1994; 25: 45-50Google Scholar). Cathodic Gel Electrophoresis—Cathodic gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions was performed according to Goldenberg (35Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, IRL Press, Oxford, UK1989: 225-250Google Scholar) with slight modifications using a β-alanine/acetic acid buffer, pH 4. Gels (12% polyacrylamide) were run at 20 mA for about 100 min at 4 °C. Fixing and staining were performed with 12.5% trichloroacetic acid and 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Aspermatogenic Effects—Assays for the aspermatogenic action of BS-RNase or the various RNase A oligomers were carried out as described elsewhere (34Matousek J. Anim. Genet. 1994; 25: 45-50Google Scholar). A 0.01–0.05-ml volume of each sample containing 100 μg of enzyme protein was injected into the left testis of five ICR mice. After 10 days, the left and right (control) testes were excised and studied histologically. Degenerative effects were assessed, namely decreased weight of the testes, decreased width of spermatogenic layers, and reduced seminiferous tubules diameter. In Vitro Assays for Antitumor Activity—The antitumor action of the various RNase A aggregates was assayed in comparison with that of BS-RNase using two human tumor cell lines, ML-2 and HL-60, originally derived from patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia. The cells were cultured in microtiter plates containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum exposed to a humidified atmosphere enriched with CO2 (5%, v/v). After the addition of the different enzyme preparations, the cells were cultured for 48 h. Four hours before ending the experiment, cells were pulse-labeled with 24 kBq of [6-3H]-thymidine (specific activity, 980 GBq/mmol, Institute for Research, Development and Application of Radioisotopes, Prague, Czech Republic). The biological action was expressed as counts per min (cpm), and inhibition of DNA synthesis was expressed as a percentage of controls. These experiments were carried out in triplicate. In Vivo Assays for Antitumor Activity—The antitumor action was tested in CD-1 athymic strain female outbred nude mice (AnLab Ltd., Charles River Laboratories, Prague, Czech Republic) weighing between 18 and 20 g. The mice (42Bracale A. Spalletti-Cernia D. Mastronicola M. Castaldi F. Mannucci R. Nitsch L. D'Alessio G. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 553-560Google Scholar, divided into seven groups of six mice each) were kept under aseptic conditions in cages with bedding (SAWI-Research bedding, AnLab Ltd.) sterilized by irradiation. They were fed with a radiation-sterilized ST-1 (Bergman) diet and given autoclaved water ad libitum. Human non-pigmented melanoma (line UB900518), obtained from a surgical specimen cut in small pieces (3 × 3 mm), was transformed (stabilized) in tissue culture. This material was transplanted subcutaneously (1 × 107 cells/nude mouse, with 0.1 ml of Matrigel) into the right flank of the nude mice. Treatment was started when the area of the transplanted tumor reached the size of 5 × 5 mm (0.15–0.26 cm3), which occurred ∼14 days after inoculation. The RNase A oligomers were administered intravenously in doses of 250 μg/20 g three times a week for 4 weeks. Saline solution was administered to control animals (a group of 11 mice). Tumor sizes were measured twice a week using a slide caliper, and volume was calculated as V = a × b × π/6, where a and b are the long and short dimensions, respectively. The percentage of tumor growth inhibition (1 – (mean tumor volume in treated group/mean tumor volume in controls) × 100) was calculated and shown in Fig. 3. Embryotoxic Effects—Two-cell embryos were obtained from superovulated mice by flushing mouse oviducts ∼36 h after mating. Embryos were cultured in CZB medium (81.62 mm NaCl, 4.83 mm KCl, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 1.18 mm MgSO4-7H2O, 25.12 mm NaHCO3, 1.7 mm CaCl2-H2O, 31.3 mm sodium lactate, 0.27 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.11 mm EDTA (disodium salt), 1 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 0.50 mg/ml streptomycin, and 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and the protein species to be tested (μg/ml; see Table II) for 72–96 h in a humidified atmosphere containing CO2 (5% v/v) at 37.5 °C (36Chatot C.L. Ziomek C.A. Bavister B.D. Lewis J.L. Torres I. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1989; 86: 679-688Google Scholar). Controls were prepared as above, but without the protein species to be tested. The developmental stage of the embryos was monitored with a stereomicroscope.Table IIDevelopment of mice embryos after 72 hours incubation with RNase A oligomers, RNase A, or BS-RNaseEnzyme species added to the medium used for embryo cultureNumber of mice embryosNumber of embryos in cell stagesBlastocystsExpanded blastocystsTotal blastocystsBlastocysts%Control (medium)1014550RNase A913444BS-RNase1010110ND1154981CD171021270NCT1154982CT1262867NCNTT + CNCTT191321579 Open table in a new tab Aspermatogenic Activity of the RNase A Oligomers—Table I shows the results of the injection of 100 μg of each of the two conformational isomers of dimeric, trimeric, or tetrameric RNase A into the left testis of a series of mice. The parameters studied to establish the degree of the aspermatogenic effect were the weight of the testes, the width of the spermatogenic layers, and the diameter of the seminiferous tubules of testes. The action of the oligomers was compared with those of native RNase A and BS-RNase. Although the statistical significance of the data might be modest because of the small number of samples, it is sufficiently clear that, although monomeric RNase A was devoid of any effect, the activities of the RNase A oligomers were, in general, similar to those displayed by BS-RNase with the exception of the index weight of testes, which was not significantly reduced by the RNase A oligomers. Moreover, the more basic tetramer (CNC), appears to have a slightly higher aspermatogenic activity than the less basic one (NCN).Table IAspermatogenic action of RNaseA oligomers compared with that of RNase A or BS-RNaseRNase A aggregates injectedNumber of miceIndex weight of testes ± S.D.Width of spermatogenic layers of testes ± S.D.Diameter of seminiferous tubules of testes ± S.D.Degree of AspermatogensisInjected testesNon-injected testesInjected testesNon-injected testesInjected testesNon-injected testesμmμmPBS (control)641 ± 942 ± 761 ± 858 ± 10152 ± 7153 ± 130RNase A542 ± 443 ± 264 ± 362 ± 6150 ± 9156 ± 60BS-RNase619 ± 832 ± 1036 ± 362 ± 8139 ± 13165 ± 112-3ND540 ± 343 ± 330 ± 560 ± 5151 ± 11153 ± 142-3CD539 ± 340 ± 137 ± 759 ± 11151 ± 5155 ± 62-3NCT535 ± 336 ± 336 ± 463 ± 6144 ± 6157 ± 92-3CT536 ± 638 ± 128 ± 1163 ± 4143 ± 18156 ± 82-3NCNTT550 ± 1842 ± 254 ± 1260 ± 4157 ± 21155 ± 51-3CNCTT540 ± 340 ± 141 ± 1561 ± 7151 ± 22161 ± 72-3 Open table in a new tab Embryotoxic Effects of the Various Aggregates of RNase A— The development of mice embryos after 72 h incubation with the two dimers or trimers of RNase A (100 μg/ml) and a mixture of the two tetrameric conformers is shown in Table II. The action of RNase A oligomers has been tested in parallel with that of BS-RNase and native RNase A. It is quite clear that, whereas 50% of two-celled-embryos reached the blastocyst stage in control experiments and 44% in the presence of monomeric RNase A, only 10% of the embryos grew to blastocysts in the presence of BS-RNase. On the contrary, no embryotoxicity was displayed by any of the aggregated species of RNase A, in the presence of which 67–82% of the embryos formed blastocysts. In Vitro Antitumor Activity of the Oligomers of RNase A— The action of the various RNase A oligomers on ML-2 (human myeloid leukemia) cells is shown in Figs. 1, A and B and 2, A and B. The activities of the two dimeric and trimeric conformers, compared with those of BS-RNase, are shown in Fig. 1A. The two dimers and the two trimers display lower antiproliferative activities than BS-RNase. Although the N-dimer is definitely less active than the C-dimer, the two trimers show similar activities. Moreover, the C-dimer and the NC-trimer, whose charge characteristics are similar (they elute quite close to each other off cation exchange chromatography) (2Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Google Scholar), also show similar antiproliferative activities. The results obtained with the two tetramers are shown in Fig. 1B. Whereas the antiproliferative action of the NCN-tetramer is similar to or slightly lower than that of BS-RNase, the CNC-tetramer, the more basic of the two, is definitely more active than both the NCN-tetramer and BS-RNase.Fig. 2Action of RNase A oligomers and BS-RNase on the proliferation of HL-60 cells.A, action of dimers and trimers of RNase A and the action of BS-RNase on the proliferation of HL-60 cells.

Fig. 2A shows the action of the two dimeric and trimeric conformers. With a dose of 10 μg/ml, the two dimers and the two trimers appear to display similar activities, but they are lower than the activities of BS-RNase. At doses higher than 20 μg/ml for the N-dimer and than 10 μg/ml for the other RNase A oligomers, their antiproliferative action is certainly higher than that of BS-RNase. As for the two tetramers (Fig. 2B), they are undoubtedly the most efficient antiproliferative agents; the CNC-tetramer, the more basic of the two, appears to be more active than the NCN-tetramer. In Vivo Antitumor Activity of the Oligomers of RNase A—The results of the last of three different series of experiments, which are qualitatively very similar to each other, are presented in Fig. 3. It is quite clear that all of the RNase A oligomers are active against the growth of human melanoma in nude mice with their action increasing as a function of the size of the oligomers, which is in agreement with the results obtained in the in vitro experiments performed on the ML-2 or HL-60 cell lines. The inhibition of tumor development exerted by trimers and tetramers is particularly strong, with the latter definitely being the most efficient antitumor agents. The only discrepancy concerns the reciprocal extent of action displayed by the two dimeric conformers; the more basic dimer (C-dimer) shows less activity than the less basic (N-dimer), whereas in the in vitro experiments the opposite result was found. It might also be worth mentioning that no significant changes in body weight of the six series of mice treated with dimers, trimers, or tetramers of RNase A could be noticed in the course of the experiment (data not shown). The results reported in this work show that the oligomers of bovine ribonuclease A, obtained by lyophilizing the enzyme protein from 40% acetic acid solutions, are endowed with some biological actions. As described in the Introduction, the structures of the two dimers and one of the two trimers have been determined, whereas for the second trimer and the two tetramers plausible models have been proposed on the basis of their dissociation products (3Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Google Scholar, 4Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Google Scholar). The biological actions of the oligomers consist in an in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity (Figs. 1, 2, and 3), as well as an aspermatogenic action (Table I), similar to those ascertained for bovine seminal RNase. The RNase A oligomers lack, instead, the embryotoxic activity, which accompanies the cytotoxic action of BS-RNase (Table II). Several points need to be discussed. First, how can RNase A oligomers enter the cells? We do not have any direct evidence about this, but we might assume that they could bind to the cell surface by adsorption and then enter the cell by endocytosis, as has been suggested for BS-RNase (26Kim J.-S. Soucek J. Matousek J. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31097-31102Google Scholar, 37Soucek. J. Matousek J. Folia Biol. (Prague). 1979; 25: 142-144Google Scholar, 38Mastronicola M.R. Piccoli R.

G1P, which specifically recognizes the non-adjacent pacL and pacR subsites and directs loading of G2P to pacC, interacts with G6P. G2P, which has endonuclease, DNA binding, and ATPase activities, interacts with G1P and does it transiently with G6P. The stoichiometry of G1P on the G1P·G2P complex promotes the transition from a G2P endonuclease to an ATPase. G6P does not alter the endonuclease activity of G2P. Both G1P and G6P, which do not have endogenous ATPase activity, synergistically enhance and modulate the ATPase activity of G2P. Based on these results, we propose a model in which the modulation of the ATPase and endonuclease activities of G2P accounts for the role of the terminase in headful packaging.

Many cellular processes require the action of a biological motor protein that converts chemical energy into mechanical force or directional movement. Packaging of viral head-to-tail concatemeric dsDNA 1The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; Myr, myricetin; SSR, square summatory residual. into viruses involves the specific interaction of virus DNA with the pre-assembled procapsid and subsequent translocation of the former into the latter, by the action of a DNA translocase, to render a highly condensed structure (1Black L.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 267-292Google Scholar, 2Catalano C.E. Cue D. Feiss M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1075-1088Google Scholar, 3Fujisawa H. Morita M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 537-545Google Scholar, 4Catalano C.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 128-148Google Scholar). DNA translocases are molecular motor proteins that use the energy of nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis to package concatemeric dsDNA onto an empty procapsid. This is a common feature shared by the DNA packaging machinery of many bacterial, pox, and herpes viruses. Two general modes for packaging of concatemeric dsDNA into the capsid of a bacterial virus (also termed bacteriophage or phage) have been proposed. The first implies a site-specific packaging in which the recognition sequence (termed cos in phage λ) plays an important role in initiation and termination of DNA encapsidation. This packaging process, which generates unit-length encapsidated molecules, is well characterized in phages λ, T3, and T7 (1Black L.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 267-292Google Scholar, 2Catalano C.E. Cue D. Feiss M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1075-1088Google Scholar, 3Fujisawa H. Morita M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 537-545Google Scholar, 4Catalano C.E. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 128-148Google Scholar). The second mode implies headful packaging, in which the encapsidation initiates at a specific site in the genome (termed pac in phage SPP1), but with the capacity of the procapsid playing a predominant role in the termination step. The sequential headful packaging mechanism generates a heterogeneous population of terminally redundant and partially circularly permuted DNA molecules as in the cases of SPP1, P1, P22, or in the case of T4 whose DNA is totally permuted and terminally redundant (Refs. 1Black L.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 267-292Google Scholar and 3Fujisawa H. Morita M. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 537-545Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Bacillus subtilis phage SPP1 replication results in the formation of large head-to-tail concatemeric dsDNA. To initiate DNA packaging, the terminase, composed of small G1P and large G2P subunits, recognizes and cleaves the concatemeric DNA within the pac site (see Refs. 5Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Google Scholar and 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar and Fig. 1). The SPP1 packaging site is divided into three discrete subsites: pacL, defining the non-encapsidated or left DNA end, pacC, the cleavage site, and pacR, the encapsidated or right DNA end (Refs. 7Bravo A. Alonso J.C. Trautner T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2881-2886Google Scholar and 8Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). The terminase, bound to the encapsidated DNA end, interacts with the portal protein G6P. Then, the DNA is translocated into an empty procapsid until the head is full (5Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Google Scholar, 7Bravo A. Alonso J.C. Trautner T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2881-2886Google Scholar, 9Dröge A. Tavares P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 103-115Google Scholar). Viral DNA translocation is a poorly understood mechanism. The SPP1 packaging motor lies at a unique vertex of the procapsid and contains the hetero-oligomeric SPP1 terminase enzyme, composed of two decameric ring-shaped G1P and two monomeric G2P, which assemble onto the pac site of SPP1 concatemeric linear dsDNA molecule, and the oligomeric G6P composed of 12 identical subunits (6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar, 8Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Google Scholar, 10Lurz R. Orlova E.V. Gunther D. Dube P. Dröge A. Weise F. van Heel. M. Tavares P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1027-1037Google Scholar). However, purified G6P in solution has 13 subunits (11Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1303-1309Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, G1P is expressed as a protein decamer, G2P as a monomer, and G6P as a tridecamer. G1P specifically recognizes the a-boxes at the pacL subsite and wraps it and contacts the c-boxes at the pacR subsite (Refs. 7Bravo A. Alonso J.C. Trautner T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2881-2886Google Scholar and 8Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). One G1P protein bound to pacL and another bound to pacR subsites interact and hold the two subsites together in a DNA loop containing the pacC subsite (8Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Google Scholar). G1P introduces a DNA distortion in the pac region, loads one G2P monomer at each of the b-boxes (Refs. 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar, 8Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Google Scholar, and 12Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 930-939Google Scholar and Fig. 1A), and interacts with G6P (this work). G2P possesses an ATP-independent endonuclease, a weak ATPase, and a sequence-independent DNA binding activity. The terminase with a relative stoichiometry of one G1P and one G2P has a very weak ATPase and an active ATP-independent endonuclease activity. However, at a higher G1P ratio the terminase enzyme binds DNA, is an active ATPase, and has a very poor endonuclease activity (Refs. 5Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Google Scholar, 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar, 8Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Google Scholar, and 13Deichelbohrer I. Messer W. Trautner T.A. J. Virol. 1982; 42: 83-90Google Scholar and this report). These properties suggested a mechanism for terminase function in the specific recognition and cleavage of the pac sequence within the viral DNA that initiates DNA packaging (5Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Google Scholar, 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar). The terminase, perhaps with the G1P1·G2P1 stoichiometry, introduces a 1-bp staggered cut at each of the 10-bp b-boxes (5′-CTATTGCGG↓C-3′, see Fig. 1A) within the distorted pacC subsite or less specific cuts with a certain preference at the 5′-GG↓CW-3′ sequence at any other DNA sequence (6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar, 12Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 930-939Google Scholar, 13Deichelbohrer I. Messer W. Trautner T.A. J. Virol. 1982; 42: 83-90Google Scholar, 14Chai S. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 282-288Google Scholar). Upon cleavage at pacC, the DNA end proximal to pacL is degraded by the G2P endonuclease (5Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Google Scholar, 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar). We have proposed that the G1P molecule bound to pacL and interacting with the other G1P molecule bound to pacR is now free to interact with G2P that has cleaved the b-box proximal to pacR (Refs. 5Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Google Scholar and 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). The terminase with a G1P>1·G2P1 stoichiometry protects the DNA end proximal to pacR, the endonuclease activity is shut off, and the ATPase activity increases (this work). The DNA binding activity of G2P remains unchanged (6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar). ATPase activity is associated exclusively to G2P as G1P binds but does not hydrolyze ATP (6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar). Like G1P, the ring-shaped oligomeric small subunit of phage T4 terminase (gp16) also enhances the ATPase activity of the monomeric terminase large subunit (15Leffers G. Rao B.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37127-37136Google Scholar, 16Rao V.B. Mitchell M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 401-411Google Scholar, 17Baumann R.G. Black L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4618-4627Google Scholar). The current packaging model predicts that the DNA end bound to the terminase is translocated unidirectionally into a preformed procapsid through a specialized channel provided by the portal protein, G6P, in an ATP-driven reaction. When a threshold amount of DNA, representing ∼103% of the genome, has been packaged the terminase introduces a poor sequence-specific cut (headful cut), perhaps at the 5′-GG↓CW-3′ sequence, that terminates the encapsidation cycle. A second cycle of encapsidation initiates from the terminase generated end, and sequential headful packaging events proceed along the DNA concatemer in a processive fashion (Refs. 5Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Google Scholar, 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar, 7Bravo A. Alonso J.C. Trautner T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2881-2886Google Scholar, 13Deichelbohrer I. Messer W. Trautner T.A. J. Virol. 1982; 42: 83-90Google Scholar, and 18Tavares P. Lurz R. Stiege A. Rückert B. Trautner T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 954-967Google Scholar and Fig. 1B). The mechanism by which packaging translocases couple the NTPase activity with dsDNA movement is still unclear and remains a subject of intense study. The SPP1 terminase and portal protein show sequence similarity with equivalent proteins from other phages that infect Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, G2P shows ∼30% identity within a 75-residue long segment with the SecA translocase, an RNA helicase, and with proteins involved in lipid transport (data not shown). In this report we have analyzed the interaction of purified terminase with the portal protein. Using different methods we might infer that G1P interacts with G6P. Initial velocity studies were performed in order to determine kinetic constants to define the influence of these two proteins over the ATPase activity of G2P. On the basis of the data obtained, a model for assembly and interaction of the terminase subunits with the portal protein to promote DNA translocation is presented. Enzymes and Reagents—G1P, G2P, and G6P were purified as previously described (12Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 930-939Google Scholar, 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar, 11Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1303-1309Google Scholar). The concentration of proteins was determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm as previously described (6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar). G1P, G2P, and G6P concentrations are expressed as mole of protein decamers, monomers, and 13-mers, respectively. Covalently closed circular plasmid DNA pBT363-borne pac DNA was purified by using the SDS lysis/cesium chloride/ethidium bromide gradient method (12Chai S. Kruft V. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1994; 202: 930-939Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP and glutaraldehyde were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Myr, proteinase K, and anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies against G1P and G6P were previously used (18Tavares P. Lurz R. Stiege A. Rückert B. Trautner T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 954-967Google Scholar, 19Gual A. Alonso J.C.

Glycerol was purchased from ICN, Biomedicals Inc., Trizma base was from Biomedicals, Nitro-Block™ was from Tropix. Imidazole and trichloroacetic acid were purchased from Merck. Glycerol Gradient—G1P (4 μm) and G6P (3 μm) were preincubated in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8), containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 300 mm or 50 mm NaCl, over 15 min at 30 °C, loaded onto the gradient (10–30%), and centrifuged (SW50 Ti, 45,000 rpm, 6 h at 4 °C). The aliquots taken from the bottom of the tubes were separated by 15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore) according to standard procedures, and the proteins detected by a mixture of polyclonal antibodies raised against both proteins. The signals were quantified by laser densitometric scanning. ATPase Assay—Standard reactions were incubated in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reactions were initiated by addition of the substrate after a preincubation of the proteins for 5 min at 37 °C and were allowed to proceed for 15 min more at 37 °C. ATPase activity was determined by measuring the amount of phosphate set free upon hydrolysis as previously described (21Ayora S. Rojo F. Ogasawara N. Nakai S. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 301-318Google Scholar). Initial velocity studies were performed using 20 nm of G2P and an ATP concentration range of 0.0005–10 mm (10–0.05 μCi/nmol). The initial velocity of ATP hydrolysis was determined within the linear range of each reaction using the following protein concentrations: 20 nm G2P, 95 nm G1P, and 80 nm G6P. ATP hydrolysis in the presence of different concentrations of G6P or/and G1P proteins and Myr, was carried out with 5 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 0.05 μCi/nmol. Km and Vmax values were obtained by non-linear least-squares fit of the experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation with the Kaleidagraph© version 3.0.2 Abelbeck Software program. The mathematics software, MATLAB® version 5.1, has made possible an iterative analysis to fit the experimental data with several theoretical models. For the binary interaction of G2P-G1P and G2P-G6P (see Fig. 3), considering E, the enzyme (G2P); M, the modulator (G1PorG6P); α, the ratio between [EMa] and [E]0; a, the modulator stoichiometry coefficient; and x0, the ratio between [M]0 and [E]0, Equations 1 and 2 were applied. K[E]0a=α(1−α)(x0−aα)a (Eq. 1) r0=VmaxE(1−α)+VmaxEMaα (Eq. 2) For the ternary interactions (Fig. 4): G2P-G1P-G6P, x0 corresponds to the ratio between [G1P]0 and [G2P]0, and y0 corresponds to the ratio between [G6P]0 and [G2P]0. The applied Equations 3, 4, 5, 6 were as follows. x0=x+KB3[C1]0xy0(1+KB3[C1]0x)+(2KA1([C1]0)2x2+4KB1([C1]0)4x4)(1+KA1([C1]0)2x2+KB1([C1]0)4x4)(Eq. 3) r0=VmaxC1+VmaxAKA1([C1]0)2x21+KA1([C1]0)2x2+KB1([C1]0)4x4(Eq. 4) y0=y+KB3[C2]0yx0(1+KB3[C2]0y)+(KA2[C2]0y+2KB2([C2]0)2y2)(1+KA2[C2]0y+KB2([C2]0)2y2)(Eq. 5) r0=VmaxC2+VmaxAKA2[C2]0y1+KA2[C2]0y+KB2([C2]0)2y2(Eq. 6) Endonuclease Activity Assay—The concentration of DNA was determined by using molar extinction coefficients of 6,500 m–1 × cm–1 at 260 nm. Form I pBT363 (20 nm) was incubated with G2P (80 nm) and different concentrations of G1P and G6P over 60 min at 37 °C in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). G2P exhibited endonuclease activity that converted Form I or supercoiled into Form II or open circular DNA as well as Form III or linear DNA (6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar). The conversion from Form I into Form II plus Form III DNA Forms was measured. In the experiments with Myr, the inhibitor was used at 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 μm concentrations. When G1P was included in the reaction Myr at 160 nm was used. Reactions were stopped by addition of 50 mm EDTA, samples deproteinized by incubation with proteinase K, and addition of 1% SDS over 30 min at 37 °C. Analytical gel electrophoreses were carried out in 0.8% (w/v) agarose/Tris borate-EDTA/ethidium bromide horizontal slab gels. Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—For protein cross-linking, the pure proteins were incubated in the presence of 0.04% glutaraldehyde at room temperature in buffer D (60 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2) containing 30 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 1.5 mm dithiothreitol with and without 1–50 μm Myr. Aliquots were collected at different times, and the reactions were stopped by precipitating the proteins with 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, followed by two washing steps with acetone. The pellets were dissolved in cracking buffer and loaded on a 15% SDS-PAGE. G1P Physically Interacts with G6P—Previously, it has been shown that G2P interacts with G1P (19Gual A. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1998; 242: 279-287Google Scholar, 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar), but fails to form a stable complex with G6P (23.Gual, A. (1998) Characterization of Bacillus subtilis Bacteriophage SPP1 Terminase Enzyme. Ph.D. Dissertation, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, SpainGoogle Scholar, 19Gual A. Alonso J.C. Virology. 1998; 242: 279-287Google Scholar, 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar). To learn whether G1P interacts with G6P a glycerol gradient was used. G1P (predicted molecular mass of 20.7 kDa), and the portal protein, G6P (predicted molecular mass of 57.3 kDa), have native molecular masses of 210 kDa (10 mer) and 745 kDa (13 mer), respectively (see Refs. 5Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Google Scholar, 8Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Google Scholar, 11Dube P. Tavares P. Lurz R. van Heel M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1303-1309Google Scholar, and 22Tavares P. Santos M. Lurz R. Morelli G. de Lencastre H. Trautner T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 81-92Google Scholar). G1P (4.5 μm), G6P (2.9 μm), or both proteins in buffer A containing 50 or 300 mm NaCl were loaded onto a linear glycerol gradient and centrifuged. The aliquots, collected from the bottom of the tube, were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted, and revealed by Western blot analysis. When the collected fractions were analyzed, a G6P broad peak, with a maximal protein concentration between fractions 4 and 5, was observed (Fig. 2A), whereas a sharper peak, with maximal protein concentration between fractions 7 and 9, was detected for G1P (Fig. 2B). The sedimentation coefficients corresponding to a molecular mass of 600–800 kDa for G6P (Fig. 2A) and of ∼200 kDa for G1P were calculated (Fig. 2B). In the presence of 300 mm NaCl, the G6P and G1P peaks are similar to the ones corresponding to the individual proteins (Fig. 2C). In the presence of 50 mm NaCl, however, G1P shifted from fractions 7–9 to fractions 2–4, and G6P was observed between fractions 2 and 5. The estimated native mass of protein complex present in fraction 3 should be ∼1,000 kDa (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, protein-protein cross-linking followed by immunoprecipitation allowed us to pull-down both G1P and G6P proteins (data not shown). These results are consistent with electron microscopy studies. Preliminary results, albeit with a limited resolution of the electron micrographs, suggest that G1P binds to the stem domain of G6P in several visualized structures. 2R. Lurz and A. G. Camacho, unpublished results. Since the G6P stem domain faces the capsid exterior (see Refs. 10Lurz R. Orlova E.V. Gunther D. Dube P. Dröge A. Weise F. van Heel. M. Tavares P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 1027-1037Google Scholar and 24Orlova E. Dube P. Beckmann E. Zemlin F. Lurz R. Trautner T.A. Tavares P. van Heel M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 842-846Google Scholar) it is likely that the detected interaction, both in the absence of G2P and/or DNA, is relevant. G6P and G1P Enhance Synergistically the G2P ATPase Activity—G2P hydrolyzed ATP and dATP to the corresponding diphosphate and inorganic phosphate, with a low affinity (Km, ∼950 μm) and activity (kcat, 26 ± 1 min–1), but fails to hydrolyze other NTPs and dNTPs (6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar). To address whether G6P is able to interact and modify any of the G2P activities, we incubated both proteins and performed nuclease and ATPase assays. G6P does not have a nuclease or NTPase activity of its own (data not shown). As revealed in Table I, G6P is able to enhance ∼2-fold the G2P ATPase activity but does not seem to modify the G2P nuclease activity (see below). The effect of G6P in lowering the Km and increasing kcat of the G2P ATPase is specific because neither bovine serum albumin nor a heat-inactivated G6P is able to stimulate the ATPase activity of G2P (data not shown).Table ICatalytic parameters of G2P, G1P·G2P, G2P·G6P and G1P·G2P·G6PProtein addedKmVmaxkcatkcat/KmμMμmol min-1 mg-1min-1M-1 s-1G2PaATPase assay was performed at 37 °C.

Open table in a new tab Previously, it has been shown that G1P lowers the Km and increases the kcat of the G2P ATPase (Ref. 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar and Table I). The presence of both G6P and G1P increase the G2P ATPase or dATPase activity, regarding both the Km of the substrate and the reaction velocity of the enzyme. None of the other purified components of the SPP1 procapsid (major capsid protein, G13P, scaffolding protein, G11P, and accessory protein, G7P) affect the ATPase activity of G2P (23.Gual, A.

In the G2P ATPase activity, ATP behaved as a Michaelis-Menten type substrate (see Table I). The Km and Vmax values were obtained by non-linear least-squares fit of the experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Since we have failed to detect a stable G2P·G6P complex by affinity chromatography, we assumed that G6P might form a transient complex with G2P. It is likely, therefore, that G6P forms a complex with the terminase (G6P·G1P·G2P), and that G6P couples the stimulated ATPase to the functional SPP1 DNA packaging machinery. G2P Interacts with G6P with a G6P1·G2P1Stoichiometry— The ATPase activity of the G2P enzyme (E) in the presence of increasing concentrations of G6P modulator (M) was analyzed using a mathematical program (see “Experimental Procedures”). This program made possible an iterative analysis to fit the experimental data with several theoretical models (one G2P with one, two, or three G6P molecules, E1M1,E1M2,E1M3, etc). The values of the catalytic constants were obtained by nonlinear least-squares fit of the experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation in the presence of increasing ATP concentrations. ATPase assays were performed with a constant amount of G2P and increasing G6P concentrations. The experimental data suggest that the stoichiometry of the complex fits best with the theoretical E1M1 model, which corresponds to the lowest SSR value, with a very high constant of 1.58 nm–1. It is noteworthy that this very high value for K, suggests a tendency for G2P to be in a complex with G6P with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 3A). When experiments containing a constant amount of G6P and increasing G2P concentrations were performed, a peak corresponding to a 1:1 stoichiometry was obtained, supporting the above data (data not shown). Since, there is only one G6P oligomer per empty procapsid it is likely that the stoichiometry of G2P and G6P in the packaging complex is G2P1·G6P1. G2P Interacts with G1P with a G1P2–3·G2P1Stoichiometry— G1P enhances the G2P ATPase activity (Ref. 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar and Table I). The ATPase assay was used to measure the stoichiometry of the G1P·G2P complex. As described in the previous section, the assay was carried out with a constant amount of G2P (E) and increasing G1P (M) concentrations. Initially, three possibilities have been considered (e.g. E1M1, E1M2, E1M3). The best fit (the lowest SSR value) corresponds to a stoichiometry coefficient of the modulator (a) = 2 (K = 6.12 × 10–4 nm–2) or (a) = 3 (K = 4.0 × 10–5 nm–3) and a stoichiometry of G1P2·G2P1 or G1P3·G2P1 (Fig. 3B). Since, in the packaging initiation complex there are two decameric G1P bound to the pacL and pacR DNA loop and one monomeric G2P molecule to the b-box proximal at pacR, it is likely that the stoichiometry of the active ATPase complex is G1P2·G2P1 (8Chai S. Lurz R. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 386-398Google Scholar, 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that the second monomeric G2P protein, that degrades the non-encapsidated, leaves the packaging initiation complex (5Chai S. Bravo A. Lüder G. Nedlin A. Trautner T.A. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 124: 87-102Google Scholar, 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar). G1P and G6P Modulate G2P Activities—To study the G6P·G1P·G2P complex interaction, two sets of experiments were performed. First, constant G2P and G6P concentrations were incubated with increasing concentrations of G1P and, second, constant G2P and G1P were incubated with increasing concentrations of G6P, and ATPase and nuclease assays were performed. The G6P and G1P concentrations selected suggest that in the initial moment all the G2P molecules would be in the form of the corresponding adducts (G2P1·G6P1 or G2P1·G1P2). As revealed in Fig. 4A, a sharp peak corresponding to the first set of experiments, suggests that initially a very active species is formed when G1P is present in the reaction; however, when more G1P is added, the initial active adduct is transformed to a nearly inactive one. Such a negative effect on the ATPase activity is not observed when G6P is omitted from the reaction mixture (Ref. 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar and data not shown). Concerning the G2P endonucleolytic activity, there is a constant inhibition when G1P is present at a ratio higher than G1P>1·G2P1 (Ref. 6Gual A. Camacho A.G. Alonso J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32311-32319Google Scholar and Fig. 4A). At low G6P, a sharp increase in the ATPase of G2P suggests that initially a very active ATPase species is formed, whereas at higher G6P concentrations, a decreased G2P ATPase is observed (Fig. 4B). The presence of an excess of G6P cannot reverse the negative effect of G1P on the G2P endonuclease activity (Fig. 4B), suggesting formation of a ternary complex of the three proteins. The results presented from both series suggest a very active ATPase species, which disappears and is transformed in other inactive or nearly inactive new species in the presence of an excess of any of the modulators (G1P or G6P). Moreover, the possible interaction of"

In this study, we have investigated a biochemical signaling pathway and transcription factors responsible for transcriptional regulation of the Cox-2 gene expression induced by CpG DNA. CpG DNA-induced Cox-2 promoter activity was completely inhibited by an endosomal acidification inhibitor (chloroquine), a TLR9 antagonist inhibitory CpG DNA, or overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) form of MyD88. In contrast, overexpression of DN-IRAK1 or DN-TRAF6 only partially inhibited CpG DNA-induced Cox-2 promoter activity and NF-κB activation, indicating the presence of additional signaling modulators downstream of MyD88. CpG DNA-induced Cox-2 promoter activity was substantially suppressed in cells overexpressing super-suppressive IκB (IκB-arachidonic acid), DN-p38, or DN-CREB. In addition, Cox-2 promoter-luciferase reporters with alterations in predicted cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements revealed that C/EBP, Ets-1, NF-κB, and CREB-binding sites are essential for optimal Cox-2 expression in response to CpG DNA. Conclusively, these results demonstrate that endosomal DNA processing and TLR9/MyD88-dependent activation of NF-κB and p38 are required for transcriptional regulation of Cox-2 expression induced by CpG DNA, and suggest that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase and/or TRAF6 may be a diverging point for NF-κB activation in response to CpG DNA in RAW264.7 cells.

Arthritis is one of the most common diseases in which inflammation and tissue destruction are driven by an autoimmune process. It has been speculated that bacterial infection may be involved in the pathogenesis of arthritis (1Granfors K. Merilahti-Palo R. Luukkainen R. Mottonen T. Lahesmaa R. Probst P. Marker-Hermann E.

Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Indeed, bacterial products such as bacterial DNA are present in the synovial fluid of patients with some types of arthritis (3Bas S. Griffais R. Kvien T.K. Glennas A. Melby K. Vischer T.L.

Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Like other bacterial products, unmethylated CpG motifs (GACGTT for murine and GTCGTT for human) in bacterial DNA are capable of activating innate immune cells, such as monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells, that play a critical role in directing the host immune response to infection (reviewed in Ref. 5Krieg A.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 709-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). The ability of bacterial DNA to activate innate immunity can be mimicked by synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing the unmethylated CpG motif (CpG DNA). CpG DNA directly activates dendritic cells and macrophages/monocytes to secrete cytokines and chemokines, including TNF-α, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; COX, cyclooxygenase; DN, dominant negative; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotides; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; IP, INFγ-inducible protein; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; AA, arachidonic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TLR, Toll-like receptor; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; iCpG, inhibitory CpG; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor 6; C/EBPβ, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β; CRE, cAMP-response element.

Some of these cytokines, such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12, have been shown to be implicated in arthritis. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that CpG DNA induces the release of arachidonic acid (AA), which is converted to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by cyclooxygenase (COX), the production of PGE2, and expression of Cox-2 (14Chen Y.

Weinberg J.B. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7703-7710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CpG DNA-mediated PGE2 production is dependent on Cox-2 (14Chen Y. Zhang J. Moore S.A. Ballas Z.K. Portanova J.P. Krieg A.M. Berg D.J. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1013-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Ghosh D.K. Misukonis M.A. Reich C. Pisetsky D.S. Weinberg J.B. Infect.

Considering the critical role of PGE2 and Cox-2 in the pathogenesis of arthritis, CpG DNA-mediated induction of Cox-2 expression may be a key factor in infection-mediated arthritis. The molecular mechanisms by which CpG DNA mediates immune cell activation are not completely understood at the present time. CpG DNA is endocytosed by leukocytes, acidified, and then recognized by Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a pattern recognition receptor, in an endosomal compartment (6Yi A.-K. Tuetken R. Redford T. Waldschmidt M. Kirsch J. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4755-4761PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K.

Immunol. 2002; 32: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Upon recognition of CpG DNA, TLR9 recruits the adapter molecule myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) through an interaction between C-terminal Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains found in both TLR9 and MyD88. This recruitment of MyD88 to the TIR domain of TLR9 initiates a signaling pathway that sequentially involves interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) and tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (16Hemmi H.

Studies using gene-deficient mice and RAW264.7 cells transiently transfected with the dominant negative (DN) forms of these molecules have indicated that this MyD88-mediated signaling pathway is essential for CpG DNA-induced activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 (16Hemmi H.

In addition to this MyD88-mediated signaling pathway, DNA-activated protein kinase and intracellular reactive oxygen species have also been demonstrated to be required for CpG DNA-mediated activation of NF-κB and JNK, which in turn leads to the expression of various oncogenes and proinflammatory cytokines (6Yi A.-K.

In contrast, Cox-2 is not detectable in most normal tissues or resting immune cells, but its expression can be induced by cytokines, growth factors, and bacterial products including endotoxin and CpG DNA (14Chen Y.

However, the relative contribution of these different signaling modulators and transcription factors to CpG DNA-induced Cox-2 transcription in macrophages has not been studied. In the present study, we have investigated whether transcriptional regulation of Cox-2 expression by CpG DNA is dependent on the endosomal processing of CpG DNA and the TLR9/MyD88-dependent signaling pathway, and we have identified cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements critical for CpG DNA-induced Cox-2 expression. Oligodeoxynucleotides—Nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (S-ODN) were purchased from Operon (Alameda, CA) and further purified by ethanol precipitation. S-ODN had no detectable endotoxins by Limulus assay. The sequences of S-ODN used are 5′-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3′ (CpG DNA, ODN1826), 5′-TCCAGGACTTCTCTCAGGTT-3′ (non-CpG DNA, ODN1982), and 5′-TCCTGGCGGGGAAGT-3′ (inhibitory CpG DNA, iCpG DNA, ODN2088). Cell Lines, Culture Conditions, and Reagents—RAW264.7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1.5 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. All culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. LPS (Salmonella minnesota Re 595) was purchased from Sigma. LPS purity was confirmed by its inability to induce IL-6 production in macrophages isolated from the LPS-unresponsive C3H/HeJ mouse strain. SB202190, U0126, and SP600125 were purchased from Calbiochem. Plasmids—The Cox-2 promoter region containing 963 bp (–963/+1) was amplified by PCR using genomic DNA as a template. The resulting Cox-2 promoter region was cloned into the pGL3 basic luciferase expression vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to generate a wild type Cox-2 promoter-luciferase reporter (COX2-promoter-luc). Deletion mutants of the Cox-2 promoter were generated by PCR using the wild type Cox-2 promoter-luciferase reporter construct as a template. Each of the resulting Cox-2 promoter deletion fragments, Δ-700 (–700/+1), Δ-320 (–320/+1), or Δ-52 (–52/+1), were cloned into the pGL3 basic luciferase expression vector to generate deletion mutant Cox-2 promoter-luciferase reporters. cis-Acting element response sites in Cox-2 promoter region were identified by sequence analysis using the TFSEARCH (Searching Transcription Factor-binding Sites (version 1.3)) software program. Putative cis-acting element response sites in the Cox-2 promoter are C/EBP(3)-(–900/–895), Ets-1-(–800/–794), NF-κB-(–402/–392), C/EBP(2)-(–135/–130), C/EBP(1)-(–90/–86), AP-1-(–65/–60), and CRE-(–60/–56).

Cells were cotransfected with pRL-TK-luciferase (1 μg) and wild type or mutant Cox-2 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs (1 μg) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In some experiments, cells were co-transfected with an equal amount (2 μg) of control empty vector (pIRES-EGFP, pCDNA3, or pUSE), DN-MyD88, DN-IRAK1, DN-TRAF6, DN-MEK1, DN-p38, DN-JNK1, IκB-AA, or DN-CREB and reporter gene Cox-2 promoter-luciferase (1 μg) plus pRL-TK-luciferase (1 μg), NF-κB-luciferase (1 μg) plus pRL-TK-luciferase (1 μg), CREB-luciferase (1 μg) plus pRL-TK-luciferase (1 μg), or AP-1-β-galactosidase (2 μg) and then incubated for 6 h. Transfected cells were pooled and washed 3 times with culture media. Cells (1 × 106 cells/1.5-mm cell culture plate) were stimulated with medium, CpG DNA (6 μg/ml), non-CpG DNA (6 μg/ml), or LPS (50 ng/ml) for 12 h. In some experiments, transfected cells were pretreated with medium, iCpG DNA (6–12 μg/ml), chloroquine (2.5 μg/ml), Me2SO, U0126 (1.25 μm), SB202190 (2.5 μm), or SP600125 (5 μm) for 15 min before stimulation. β-Galactosidase and luciferase activities in cell extracts were analyzed according to manufacturers' protocols using Galacto-Light Plus Reporter gene assay (Tropix, Bedford, MA) and Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI), respectively. Luciferase activity was normalized using pRL-TK-luciferase activity (Renilla luciferase activity) in each sample. For AP1-β-galactosidase assay, equal concentrations of cell lysates were used. Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates and Western Blot Analysis— RAW264.7 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) were pretreated with Me2SO or SP600125 (5 μm) for 30 min and then stimulated with medium or CpG DNA (6 μg/ml) for 45 min. Whole cell lysates were prepared as described previously (55Yi A.-K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4493-4497PubMed Google Scholar). To detect the presence of a specific protein or the phosphorylation status of a specific protein, equal amounts (15 μg/lane) of whole cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS, and then Western blots were performed as described previously (55Yi A.-K. Krieg A.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4493-4497PubMed Google Scholar). As a loading control, blots were probed for actin using an actin-specific antibody purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

https://openalex.org/W2001629507,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2A and NR2B subunits of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by Src protein-tyrosine kinases modulates receptor channel activity and is necessary for the induction of long term potentiation (LTP). Deletion of H-Ras increases both NR2 tyrosine phosphorylation and NMDA receptor-mediated hippocampal LTP. Here we investigated whether H-Ras regulates phosphorylation and function of the NMDA receptor via Src family protein-tyrosine kinases. We identified Src as a novel H-Ras binding partner. H-Ras bound to Src but not Fyn both in vitro and in brain via the Src kinase domain. Cotransfection of H-Ras and Src inhibited Src activity and decreased NR2A tyrosine phosphorylation. Treatment of rat brain slices with Tat-H-Ras depleted NR2A from the synaptic membrane, decreased endogenous Src activity and NR2A phosphorylation, and decreased the magnitude of hippocampal LTP. No change was observed for NR2B. We suggest that H-Ras negatively regulates Src phosphorylation of NR2A and retention of NR2A into the synaptic membrane leading to inhibition of NMDA receptor function. This mechanism is specific for Src and NR2A and has implications for studies in which regulation of NMDA receptor-mediated LTP is important, such as synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory and addiction.

Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61Google Scholar, 2Kumari M. Ticku M.K. Prog. Drug Res. 2000; 54: 152-189Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation modulates NMDA receptor function; for example, inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity decreases NMDA receptor-mediated currents, whereas treatment with tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors increases these currents (3Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 233-235Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B occurs via Fyn and Src protein-tyrosine kinases (4Lau L.F. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20036-20041Google Scholar, 5Rostas J.A. Brent V.A. Voss K. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V. Gurd J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10452-10456Google Scholar), resulting in potentiation of NMDA channel activity (6Kohr G. Seeburg P.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 445-452Google Scholar, 7Yu X.M. Askalan R. Keil II, G.J. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Google Scholar). NMDA receptor phosphorylation by Src and Fyn is modulated by many mechanisms including protein kinase C (8Lu W.Y. Xiong Z.G. Lei S. Orser B.A. Dudek E. Browning M.D. MacDonald J.F. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 331-338Google Scholar) and the scaffolding protein RACK1 (9Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). Thus, the modulation of NMDA receptor function by Src protein-tyrosine kinases likely involves the convergence of diverse signaling pathways generating a complex mechanism of receptor regulation. Glutamate activation of the NMDA receptor and the subsequent increase in intracellular calcium are essential for the induction of long term potentiation (LTP), a candidate mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity (10Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Google Scholar) thought to mediate learning and memory (11Rogan M.T. Staubli U.V. LeDoux J.E. Nature. 1997; 390: 604-607Google Scholar, 12McKernan M.G. Shinnick-Gallagher P. Nature. 1997; 390: 607-611Google Scholar). NMDA receptor-mediated LTP is associated with an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2 subunits via a mechanism that requires Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (5Rostas J.A. Brent V.A. Voss K. Errington M.L. Bliss T.V. Gurd J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10452-10456Google Scholar). In the CA1 region of the hippocampus, activation of Src occurs within 5 min of LTP induction, and LTP can be prevented by application of Src-specific inhibitors (13Lu Y.M. Roder J.C. Davidow J. Salter M.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1363-1367Google Scholar). In addition, Fyn knockout mice show impaired LTP, which can be rescued by introduction of a Fyn transgene (14Grant S.G. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1903-1910Google Scholar, 15Kojima N. Wang J. Mansuy I.M. Grant S.G. Mayford M. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4761-4765Google Scholar). Thus, both Src and Fyn are necessary for the induction of LTP (13Lu Y.M. Roder J.C. Davidow J. Salter M.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1363-1367Google Scholar, 14Grant S.G. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1903-1910Google Scholar, 15Kojima N. Wang J. Mansuy I.M.

Recently, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2A and NR2B and subsequent enhanced LTP was observed in the hippocampus of H-Ras null mice (17Manabe T. Aiba A. Yamada A. Ichise T. Sakagami H. Kondo H. Katsuki M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2504-2511Google Scholar). H-Ras functions as a molecular switch, existing in an active GTP-bound or inactive GDP-bound form (18Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Google Scholar). It is an upstream initiator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which in neurons can be activated by the influx of calcium resulting from activation of the NMDA receptor (19Iida N. Namikawa K. Kiyama H. Ueno H. Nakamura S. Hattori S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6459-6466Google Scholar, 20Yun H.Y. Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many components of the H-Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway are associated with the postsynaptic density (PSD (22Suzuki T. Mitake S. Murata S. Brain Res. 1999; 840: 36-44Google Scholar)), a region of the synapse packed with signal transduction complexes, including Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, which colocalize with the NMDA receptor (23Kennedy M.B. Science. 2000; 290: 750-754Google Scholar, 24Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Google Scholar, 25Yamauchi T. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2002; 21: 266-286Google Scholar). A number of Ras family regulatory proteins have also been identified in the PSD, suggesting that the H-Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway may have varied synapse-specific functions (26Kim J.H. Liao D. Lau L.F. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 20: 683-691Google Scholar, 27Chen H.J. Rojas-Soto M. Oguni A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1998; 20: 895-904Google Scholar, 28Okabe T. Nakamura T. Nishimura Y.N.

Because NMDA receptor channel activity is positively regulated by Src tyrosine phosphorylation that is essential for LTP, we hypothesized that H-Ras negatively regulates NMDA phosphorylation and function via inhibition of a Src protein-tyrosine kinase. Here we present data showing that Src and H-Ras interact in vitro and in the brain. The interaction is specific for Src because Fyn, another member of the Src family expressed in the PSD, was unable to bind H-Ras. H-Ras binds via the Src kinase domain and inhibits Src kinase activity, decreasing phosphorylation and, subsequently, the membrane level of NR2A. Furthermore, overexpression of H-Ras in hippocampal slices results in a decrease in NMDA-mediated LTP. Taken together our results imply that H-Ras negatively regulates NMDA receptor channel activity by decreasing the number of NR2A-containing NMDA receptors in the synaptic membrane.

Agarose pellets were washed (1× PBS, 1% Triton X-100), and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-Src (1:500), anti-Fyn (1:500), or anti-H-Ras (1:5000) monoclonal antibodies. The H-Ras-GST-agarose pull-down and competition assays using radiolabeled in vitro translated proteins were incubated and resolved as above. Gels were fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, incubated in Amplify, and dried down. Radiolabeled proteins were detected by overnight fluorography (–80 °C). Plasmid Construction—Src deletion mutant cDNAs, Src-SH3 (amino acids 84–145), Src-SH2 (amino acids 151–238), and Src-KD (amino acids 270–523), were amplified from pUSE-SrcWT using the Expand PCR system and cloned into pGBKT7. H-RasWT cDNA was amplified from mRNA generated from NT2 cells and cloned into pTAT-HA via EcoRI and XhoI sites. Preparation of Brain Homogenates—Src –/– mice, Fyn–/– mice, and 3–4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were euthanized with halothane, whole brain-dissected, and homogenized in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as per manufacturer's instructions). Membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described previously (31Dunah A.W. Standaert D.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5546-5558Google Scholar). Briefly, homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min, yielding pellet (P1) and supernatant (S1) fractions. The S1 fraction was further centrifuged (10,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) generating fractions P2 (crude synaptosomal membranes) and S2 (cytosol and light membranes). Pellets were washed in cold PBS then solubilized in solubilization buffer (1% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, protease and phosphatase inhibitors as per the manufacturer's instructions). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed with 5 μg of the appropriate antibodies and 500 μg of protein homogenate as described previously (9Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). Transfection—L(-tk) cells were cultured on 100-mm plates, and expression of NR1 and NR2A was induced as previously described (32Grimwood S. Le Bourdelles B. Atack J.R. Barton C. Cockett W. Cook S.M. Gilbert E. Hutson P.H. McKernan R.M. Myers J. Ragan C.I. Wingrove P.B. Whiting P.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2239-2247Google Scholar). When 60% confluent, cells were transfected with a total of 10 μg of pUSE-SrcWT and pUSE-H-RasWT cDNA using LipofectAMINE PLUS in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of Cell Homogenates—L(-tk) cells were washed once with cold PBS, harvested, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 1% deoxycholate, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors as per the manufacturer's instructions). Samples were sonicated briefly, and lysis was allowed to proceed for 30 min on ice. Determination of the protein concentration was made using a BCA kit (Pierce). In addition, samples were also normalized with respect to SrcWT by Western blot and densitometry (NIH Image Version 1.62). Generation of Phospho-NR2A-specific Polyclonal Antibody—The NR2A-derived peptide RLLEGNFY(PO3)GSLFSV corresponding to amino acids 1318–1331 was generated by SynPep and used to immunize rabbits. Test bleeds were made over the course of three months, after which terminal bleeds were taken. The antigenicity of the bleeds was analyzed by slot blot using the immunizing peptide and showed increasing recognition of the antigen over three months. The terminal bleed was tested in the same way and then subsequently purified using the phospho-peptide coupled to an inert support. Specificity for the phosphorylated NR2A epitope was analyzed by slot blotting the immunizing phospho-peptide and a non-phospho form of the same epitope. No cross-reaction with the non-phospho-peptide was detected. Raf-1 Binding Assay—Raf-1 H-Ras binding domain GST-agarose and rat total brain homogenate (250 μg) were diluted in PBS and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C as per the manufacturer's instructions. Raf-1-H-Ras complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-H-Ras antibodies. Preparation of Tat-H-Ras Fusion Protein—pTAT-H-RasWT was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as previously described (33He D.Y. Vagts A.J. Yaka R. Ron D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 272-280Google Scholar). Tat fusion protein was detected using anti-HA antibodies. Immunohistochemistry—After incubation with 1 μm Tat-H-Ras, L(-tk) cells were washed in cold wash buffer (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100), fixed in ice-cold methanol for 3 min, and blocked in wash buffer containing 0.3% normal goat serum for 4 h at room temperature. Immunofluorescence was performed using rat monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (1:100) incubated overnight at 4 °C. Staining was detected with secondary antibodies conjugated to Texas Red (1:500) incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Slides were mounted using Vectashield and viewed with a Zeiss 510 meta laser-scanning confocal microscope. Images shown are individual middle sections of projected Z series and were processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc). Preparation of Tat-H-Ras-treated Brain Slices—Coronal whole brain slices were prepared from 3–4 week old male Sprague-Dawley rats (300 μm), Src–/–, and Fyn–/– mice (250 μm). The slices were allowed to recover for at least 1 h in an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) perfusion medium saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 containing 126 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO3, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 18 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose. Slices were incubated in either aCSF (Control) or 1 μm Tat-H-Ras diluted in aCSF (treated) for 2 h at room temperature, after which homogenates were made and fractionated as described above. Electrophysiology—Transverse hippocampal slices (350 μm) were prepared from 3–5-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. Slices were maintained for at least 2 h in aCSF that contained 126 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 0.01 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 18 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose saturated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 25 °C. After recovery, slices were submerged and continuously superfused with aCSF at 25 °C. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from stratum-radiatum of CA1 region with glass microelectrodes filled with 2 m NaCl. Picrotoxin (100 μm) was added to the bath solution to block GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. To evoke fEPSPs, Schaffer collateral/commissural afferents were stimulated with 0.1-Hz pulses using steel bipolar microelectrodes at intensities adjusted to produce an evoked response that was 40–50% that of the maximum-recorded fEPSP for each recording. LTP was induced by high frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 1-s duration, 2 trains at 10-s intervals) at the same intensity as the test stimulus, and synaptic responses were monitored for 60 min after LTP induction. Data were collected using an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon instruments), filtered at 2 kHz, and digitized at 5–10 kHz. Compiled data were analyzed and expressed as the mean percent of fEPSP slope ±S.E. over the base-line levels. Src and H-Ras Interact in Vitro and in Brain—We set out to determine whether H-Ras negatively regulates the NMDA receptor through a Src-dependent mechanism. Previously Stancato et al. (34Stancato L.F. Silverstein A.M. Owens-Grillo J.K. Chow Y.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4013-4020Google Scholar) observed that H-Ras coimmunoprecipitates with Src in Sf9 insect cells. Because both Src and H-Ras are present in the PSD (24Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Google Scholar), we hypothesized that H-Ras may regulate Src activity via a direct interaction. To confirm that Src and H-Ras interact directly, purified Src was incubated with H-Ras-GST-agarose or GST-Sepharose alone. H-Ras-GST-agarose was capable of “pulling down” Src (Fig. 1a, lane 3), whereas no interaction was observed between Src and GST-Sepharose (Fig. 1a, lane 4), suggesting a direct interaction between Src and H-Ras in vitro. To determine the specificity of this interaction, the pull-down experiment was repeated using another member of the Src family, Fyn, which shares 84% sequence homology with Src and is also expressed in the PSD (35Suzuki T. Okumura-Noji K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 582-588Google Scholar). There was no significant interaction detected between Fyn and H-Ras (Fig. 1b, lane 3), suggesting that the interaction between H-Ras and Src is specific and not a general property of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases. Next, to confirm that the Src-H-Ras interaction occurred in brain, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies in rat brain homogenate (Fig. 1c). We found that anti-Src antibodies were capable of co-immunoprecipitating H-Ras (lane 1) and, conversely, that anti-H-Ras antibodies formed an immune complex with Src (lane 2). In summary, we show that Src and H-Ras can interact in vitro and in rat brain. H-Ras Interacts with Src via Its Kinase Domain—Src is comprised of a unique N-terminal region, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain (36Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Google Scholar). To further characterize the Src–H-Ras interaction, we made constructs of various domains and expressed them as [35S]methionine-labeled proteins by in vitro translation (Fig. 2a). Radiolabeled Src-SH3, Src-SH2, and Src-KD were incubated with H-Ras-GST-agarose and analyzed by fluorography. Src-KD, but not SrcSH2 or SrcSH3, bound to H-Ras-GST-agarose, indicating that the kinase domain of Src contains a binding site for H-Ras (Fig. 2a, lane 6). To confirm the identification of the binding site, a competition assay was carried out in which H-Ras-GST-agarose was preincubated with either control (in vitro translated empty plasmid) or non-radiolabeled in vitro translated kinase domain (KD; Fig. 2b). Radiolabeled kinase domain (35S-labeled KD) was then added to the reaction, and the incubation was allowed to proceed. Assuming that the kinase domain is indeed the binding site for H-Ras, fewer binding sites would be available for 35S-labeled KD binding after preincubation with unlabeled KD. Indeed, there was a decrease in 35S-labeled KD detected after H-Ras-GST-agarose preincubation with unlabeled KD (lane 2) when compared with H-Ras-GST-agarose preincubation with control (lane 1). Therefore, the Src-H-Ras interaction was mediated at least in part through binding between H-Ras and the kinase domain of Src. H-Ras Inhibits Src Kinase Activity and Subsequent NR2A Phosphorylation—The activation state of Src is affected by its structure. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tyrosine of Src (Tyr-529) by an upstream kinase, Csk, results in an intramolecular interaction between the phosphorylated residue and the Src-SH2 domain, inactivating Src (36Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Google Scholar, 37Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Google Scholar, 38Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation or binding by other molecules displaces this folding, allowing Src autophosphorylation of Tyr-418 and activation (for review, see Refs. 39Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Google Scholar and 40Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Google Scholar). Because H-Ras interacts via the kinase domain of Src (Fig. 2, a and b), we tested whether the binding of H-Ras to Src affected Src kinase activity. L(-tk) mouse fibroblast cells were transiently transfected with combinations of SrcWT and H-RasWT cDNA. Immunoprecipitation using anti-Src-agarose confirmed that in these cells, Src co-immunoprecipitated with H-Ras (Fig. 3a, lane 2). Therefore Src activity was measured in the presence of H-Ras using anti-Src[pY418], an antibody that recognizes active autophosphorylated Src. In cells transfected with SrcWT alone, anti-Src[pY418] detected a robust signal corresponding to Src at 60 kDa (Fig. 3b, top panel, lane 1), suggesting that transfected Src was active. Cotransfection of H-RasWT with SrcWT resulted in a sharp decrease in active Src (Fig. 3b, top panel, lane 2). Our results show that H-Ras significantly inhibits the ability of Src to autophosphorylate Tyr-418, implying that Src kinase activity is abrogated by the binding of H-Ras to the Src kinase domain. Because NR2A is a substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation by Src (6Kohr G. Seeburg P.H. J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 445-452Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of H-Ras overexpression and the consequent inhibition of Src activity on the tyrosine phosphorylation state of NR2A. To do so we used L(-tk) cells stably transfected with NR1 and NR2A and transiently transfected them with combinations of SrcWT and H-RasWT cDNA. In addition, we generated a polyclonal rabbit antibody against tyrosine 1325-phosphorylated NR2A (41Yang M. Leonard J.P. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 580-588Google Scholar) and tested for the effects of H-Ras overexpression on basal level phosphorylation of NR2A. As predicted, there was a decrease in phosphorylated NR2A in SrcWT/H-RasWT-transfected cells compared with those transfected with Src alone (Fig. 3c). Thus, co-transfection with H-RasWT decreased Src kinase activity, consequently inhibiting Src-mediated NR2A phosphorylation. Active Tat-H-Ras Transduces into Cultured Cells and Brain and Inhibits Endogenous Src Kinase Activity—To determine whether H-Ras modulates endogenous Src kinase activity and NR2A-mediated channel function, we used the Tat fusion protein transduction system (42Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Google Scholar) to elevate H-Ras protein levels in brain slices. We generated a Tat-H-Ras construct and expressed and purified the fusion protein from E. coli as described previously (33He D.Y. Vagts A.J. Yaka R. Ron D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 272-280Google Scholar). First, we used immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy to confirm that the fusion protein was capable of entering cells. Control and Tat-H-Ras (1 μm)-transduced L(-tk) cells were fixed and analyzed using an antibody against an HA tag engineered into the Tat fusion protein (Fig. 4a). There was a clear antibody signal detected in cells treated with Tat-H-Ras (right panel) but not in control (left panel). Because the images shown represent the middle sections of a projected Z series, Tat-H-Ras has been successfully transduced through the cell membrane. Next, we tested Tat-H-Ras transduction in brain slices. Coronal rat whole brain slices were incubated in the absence or presence of Tat-H-Ras, homogenized, and fractionated to P2 (crude synaptosomes) and S2 (cell cytosol, light membranes) fractions. The integrity of the fractions was confirmed using an antibody against PSD-95 (data not shown), a protein enriched in the PSD (43Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Google Scholar), and Tat-H-Ras was detected in the P2 pellet fraction (Fig. 4b, lane 3) correlating with previous data showing that H-Ras is localized to the membrane (44Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Google Scholar, 45Prior I.A. Harding A. Yan J. Sluimer J. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 368-375Google Scholar). To determine whether transduced Tat-H-Ras was functional, we utilized the Raf-1 binding assay (Fig. 4b). Initiation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway requires H-Ras to be active (i.e. GTP-bound) before it can bind to and activate Raf-1, a kinase downstream of H-Ras (46Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Google Scholar). Thus, the activation state of Tat-H-Ras can be determined by its binding to the H-Ras binding domain on Raf-1. We found that transduced Tat-H-Ras did indeed bind to Raf-1 H-Ras binding domain (Fig. 4b, lane 3), suggesting that Tat-H-Ras was successfully transduced into brain, activated, and correctly compartmentalized. Because transfection of H-Ras caused a decrease in Src kinase activity in L(-tk) cells (Fig. 3a), we examined Src kinase activity in Tat-H-Ras-treated brain slices using anti-Src[pY418] antibodies. The pY418 signal was reduced in slices treated with Tat-H-Ras (Fig. 4c, top panel, lanes 1 and 3), implying that transduction of Tat-H-Ras decreases Src kinase activity through in vivo interaction with the Src kinase domain. Tat-H-Ras Decreases NR2A Retention and NR2A Phosphorylation in Synaptic Membranes—Interestingly, we found that the level of NR2A in the crude synaptosomal membrane fraction (P2) was decreased after transduction of Tat-H-Ras (Fig. 5a, top panel, lanes 1 and 3). In addition, there was a concomitant decrease in phosphorylated NR2A on Tat-H-Ras treatment (Fig. 5a, middle panel, lanes 1 and 3), consistent with the observations made for NR2A in L(-tk) cells (Fig. 3c). Because Src is capable of phosphorylating NR2B as well as NR2A in vitro (47Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 657-666Google Scholar) and because inhibition of Src-mediated phosphorylation by H-Ras decreased NR2A in the synaptic membrane, we examined whether H-Ras affects retention of NR2B in the synaptic membrane. There was no change in NR2B levels in the synaptic membrane after Tat-H-Ras treatment (Fig. 5b), suggesting that Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation plays a major role in specifically retaining NR2A-containing NMDA receptors in the membrane. Retention of NR2A in the Membrane Is Mediated by a Src-specific Mechanism—To confirm that the observed membrane depletion of NR2A was mediated via a Src tyrosine kinase mechanism, we transduced Tat-H-Ras into brain slices from Src –/– and Fyn –/– mice.

https://openalex.org/W2067626836,"Inhibitor-2 (I-2) is a regulator of protein phosphatase type-1 (PP1), known to be phosphorylated in vitro by multiple kinases. In particular Thr72 is a Thr-Pro phosphorylation site conserved from yeast to human, but there is no evidence that this phosphorylation responds to any physiological signals. Here, we used electrophoretic mobility shift and immunoblotting with a site-specific phospho-Thr72 antibody to establish Thr72 phosphorylation in HeLa cells and show a 25-fold increase in phosphorylation during mitosis. Mass spectrometry demonstrated I-2 in actively growing HeLa cells was also phosphorylated at three other sites, Ser120, Ser121, and an additional Ser located between residues 70 and 90. In vitro kinase assays using recombinant I-2 as a substrate showed that the Thr72 kinase(s) was activated during mitosis, and sensitivity to kinase inhibitors indicated that the principal I-2 Thr72 kinase was not GSK3 but instead a member of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase family. Immunocytochemistry confirmed Thr72 phosphorylation of I-2 during mitosis, with peak intensity at prophase, and revealed subcellular concentration of the phospho-Thr72 I-2 at centrosomes. Together, the data show dynamic changes in I-2 phosphorylation during mitosis and localization of phosphorylated I-2 at centrosomes, suggesting involvement in mammalian cell division.

Glinsmann W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies purified a heterodimer containing PP1 and I-2, termed MgATP-dependent phosphatase, and showed that I-2 phosphorylation at Thr72 by GSK3 resulted in transient activation of this complex (2DePaoli-Roach A.A.

Phosphorylation of I-2 at Ser86, Ser120, and Ser121 by casein kinase II (CKII) promoted phosphorylation at Thr72 by GSK3, but CKII phosphorylation alone had little effect on the activity of the complex. More recent studies suggest that I-2 is subject to phosphorylation by multiple protein kinases, including CKII, CKI, cdc2, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and GSK3 (2DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol.

A subset of these kinases, also known as Pro-directed kinases, namely GSK3, cdc2, and mitogenactivated protein kinase, specifically phosphorylate I-2 in the conserved Thr72-Pro site and therefore may modulate PP1 function in cells. Phosphorylation of I-2 in animal tissues has been studied. Depaoli-Roach and Lee (8DePaoli-Roach A.A. Lee F.-T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) immunoprecipitated I-2 from 32P metabolically labeled mouse diaphragm. Phospho-amino acid analysis showed that I-2 was phosphorylated on both serine and threonine, with ∼nine times more [32P]phosphoserine than [32P]phosphothreonine. Holmes et al. (9Holmes C.F.B. Kuret J. Chisholm A.A.K. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) purified I-2 from rabbit skeletal muscle and using mass spectrometry showed that Ser86 (0.7 mol/mol), Ser120, and Ser121 (0.3 mol/mol each) were phosphorylated, but no phosphorylation of Thr72 was detected. Lawrence et al. (10Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J. Burnette B. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1988; 150: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) immunoprecipitated I-2 from 32P-labeled mouse fat cells and showed the presence of both [32P]phosphoserine and [32P]phosphothreonine, with the phosphothreonine level being less than 10% of phosphoserine. Moreover, despite the fact that GSK3 is inactivated in response to insulin, threonine phosphorylation of I-2 was unchanged by insulin treatment of the fat cells (10Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J. Burnette B. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1988; 150: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This suggested that phosphorylation of Thr72 in vivo was most likely not regulated by GSK3. Physiological regulation of Thr72 phosphorylation in I-2 has not been demonstrated. To analyze the phosphorylation of I-2 in living cells we generated a phospho-site-specific antibody that uniquely recognized I-2 phosphorylated at Thr72. Using this antibody, we show here that I-2 is indeed phosphorylated on Thr72 in cells, and this modification is enhanced nearly 25-fold during mitosis. Using kinase inhibitors we tested whether Thr72 phosphorylation of I-2 in mitotic cells was catalyzed by GSK3 or cyclin-dependent protein kinases. Immunostaining showed that phosphorylation of I-2 at Thr72 in mitotic cells was concentrated at centrosomes. The data suggested that reversible phosphorylation of I-2 may control centrosome-associated PP1 activity, which could play a role in mammalian cell division. General Reagents—Tissue culture media and sera were obtained from Invitrogen. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% neonatal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Roscovitine and GSK3 inhibitor (3-(3-carboxy-4-chloroanilino)-4-(3-nitrophenyl)maleimide) were purchased from Calbiochem. Chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Recombinant I-2 was purified as previously described by Eto et al. (11Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Cell Synchronization and Cell Lysate Preparation—HeLa cells were synchronized by incubating with 400 μm mimosine for 24 h or with 200 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h. Cells were rinsed with PBS and scraped into SDS-containing sample buffer. Inhibitor 2 Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were rinsed with room temperature PBS, and the dish was placed on a mixture of acetone and dry ice, and 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid was added for 10 min. Cells were scraped from the dish using a Costar cell lifter. The slurry was transferred to a 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed twice with cold acetone and resuspended in urea resolubilization buffer (9 m urea, 20 mm Tris, 23 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). This suspension was incubated at 30 °C for ∼1 h until the protein pellet was dissolved. The solution was diluted 10-fold with immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 mm Pefabloc, 1 μm Microcystin-LR). After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g the supernatant was used for I-2 immunoprecipitation. Briefly, the lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with I-2 antibody coupled to protein G beads. The beads were pelleted and washed with wash buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 μm Microcystin-LR, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) three times. The beads were resuspended in SDS-containing sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—The protein band corresponding to I-2 was excised from the gel and destained with 0.5 ml of 50% methanol/5% acetic acid overnight at room temperature before dehydration in 200 μl of acetonitrile and drying in a vacuum centrifuge. The proteins were reduced by addition of 50 μl of 10 mm dithiothreitol and alkylated by addition of 50 μl of 100 mm iodoacetamide (each for 30 min at room temperature). The gel slices were dehydrated in 200 μl of acetonitrile, hydrated in 200 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and dehydrated again with 200 μl of acetonitrile. The dehydrated gel pieces were again dried in a vacuum centrifuge and rehydrated in 50 μl of 20 ng/μl ice-cold, sequencing-grade modified porcine trypsin (Promega) for 5 min on ice. Excess trypsin was removed, and digestion was carried out overnight at 37 °C. The peptides released by the digestion were collected by successive extractions with 50 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50 μl of 50% acetonitrile/5% formic acid (2×), combining the extracts in a siliconized 0.6-ml microcentrifuge tube rinsed previously with ethanol, water, and ethanol. The combined extract was concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge to 20 μl prior to analysis on a Finnigan LCQ (ThermoQuest) ion-trap mass spectrometer with a Protana nanospray ion source that was interfaced to a self-packed 8-cm × 75-μm inner diameter Phenomenex Jupiter 10-μm C18 reverse-phase capillary column. The peptides (0.5 μl) were injected and eluted from the column with an acetonitrile/0.1 m acetic acid gradient (2–85% acetonitrile in 30 min) at a flow rate of 0.25 μl min–1. The microspray ion source was set at 2.8 kV, and the data were analyzed using a full data-dependent acquisition routine with the amino acid sequence acquired in the four scans before the cycle repeats. This produced ∼500 tandem mass spectrometry spectra of peptides ranging in abundance over several orders of magnitude. Antibody Production and Purification—The synthetic peptide, MKIDEPTPYH, with the threonine phosphorylated was conjugated to either hemocyanin or thyroglobulin. Antisera were produced by subcutaneous injection of this peptide into rabbits. The serum was precleared over unphosphorylated recombinant I-2. The unbound fraction was incubated with I-2 phosphorylated by both CKII and GSK3β and coupled to AffiGel-15 (Bio-Rad). After several washes with PBS, the column was washed with 50 mm NaPO4, pH 5.5. The antibody that remained bound to the phosphorylated I-2 was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 1.8 in 10% dioxane. The antibody solution was neutralized and concentrated. This antibody is referred to as phospho-Thr72 (9Holmes C.F.B. Kuret J. Chisholm A.A.K. Cohen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 870: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assay and Inhibitors—HeLa cells were treated with lysis buffer (1% (V/V) Nonidet P-40, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Microcystin-LR, 0.4 mm Pefabloc SC, 0.1% (V/V) 2-mercaptoethanol). Cells were incubated in lysis buffer on ice for 10 min and then homogenized by passage through an insulin syringe. Reactions were set up in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm Microcystin-LR, 10 mm NaF, 4 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Pefabloc SC, 0.1 mm ATP with 5 μg of I-2 in 50 μl. Cell homogenate was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and stopped by addition of SDS-containing sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Immunocytochemistry—HeLa cells were cultured on fibronectincoated coverslips. Coverslips were washed once with PBS followed by incubation in cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100 for 15 min. Specimens were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/1% ovalbumin and incubated with a purified sheep antibody to I-2, the rabbit antibody to phospho-Thr72 I-2, or both. A goat anti-sheep IgG antibody-conjugated rhodamine (Amersham Biosciences) or a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexafluor was used for immunofluorescent imaging. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Vectorshield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Cells were visualized using a Nikon Microphot-5A microscope with ×20 objective, and images were captured with a Hamamatsu C4742 digital camera operated by Open-Lab software (Improvision) and processed in Adobe Photoshop. Specificity of Phospho-site Antibody against P-Thr 72 of I-2—To examine I-2 phosphorylation at Thr72 in cells we developed an phospho-site-specific antibody using a phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the amino acid sequence surrounding this site in human I-2. The antibody was affinity purified using differential binding between unphospho- and phospho-I-2. Specificity was confirmed with recombinant I-2 (rI-2) that had been phosphorylated in vitro using purified protein kinases. As seen in Fig. 1, the antibody did not cross-react with the unphosphorylated rI-2 or rI-2 phosphorylated by CKII alone (i.e. phosphorylated at Ser86, Ser120, and Ser121). However, the phospho-Thr72 antibody recognized rI-2 that had been phosphorylated by the combination of GSK3 and CKII, which is well known to produce I-2 phosphorylation at Thr72, in addition to Ser86, Ser120, and Ser121. Thus, the antibody only recognized I-2 that was phosphorylated at Thr72. Phosphorylation of I-2 in Living Cells—HeLa cells were prepared at different phases of the cell cycle, either unsynchronized (U, mostly interphase; see Fig. 2) or synchronized by addition of mimosine (to block at S phase) or nocodazole (to block at mitosis). Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and compared by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). I-2 migrated as a single band in either unsynchronized or S-phase cells and was recognized by anti-I-2 antibody. This form of I-2 was not reactive with phospho-Thr72 antibody, suggesting that Thr72 in I-2 was predominantly unphosphorylated in these cells. However, the I-2 recovered from nocodazole-treated cells displayed an additional band of I-2 with decreased mobility. This lower mobility form of I-2 was readily recognized by the anti-phospho-Thr72 antibody, showing phosphorylation of I-2 at Thr72 in cells during mitosis. We immunoblotted total cell proteins from unsynchronized and mitotic HeLa cells with the phospho-Thr72 site-specific antibody (Fig. 2B). In proteins from mitotic cells only one band corresponding to phospho-Thr72 I-2 was specifically stained near 35 kDa, and this was not detected in unsynchronized cells. One nonspecific band at 50 kDa was stained in both samples with equal intensity. These results further demonstrated the high degree of specificity of the phospho-Thr72 antibodies and confirmed that phosphorylation of I-2 at the Thr72 site occurred in particular during mitosis. To directly determine the phosphorylation state of all the other sites in I-2 in unsynchronized HeLa cells, we employed the trichloroacetic acid fixation method. This protocol was first developed for immunohistochemistry, to preserve the phosphorylation state of proteins that were otherwise rapidly dephosphorylated (12Hayashi K. Yonemura S. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We adapted this method to purify phosphorylated I-2. Cells were directly treated with trichloroacetic acid, scraped, and centrifuged, and the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were resuspended in a saturated urea solution. Following the dilution of the urea solution, I-2 was immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. The I-2 protein was excised from the gel and digested with trypsin. Mass spectrometry revealed that Ser120 and Ser121 were phosphorylated to a stoichiometry of 0.9 mol/mol each. An additional phosphate was also detected in a peptide corresponding to residues 70–90 (which contains a single serine residue, Ser86), but this could not be further analyzed because of low yield of this peptide (Fig. 3). Alkaline phosphatase treatment of HeLa cell lysates resulted in conversion of I-2 to a single band that migrated faster than all of the forms seen in Fig. 2A, consistent with Ser phosphorylation of I-2 in cells throughout the cell cycle (data not shown). Thr72 Phosphorylation of I-2 during Mitosis—To examine in more detail the phosphorylation of I-2 on Thr72 during mitosis, we employed immunoblotting with the phospho-Thr72 site-specific antibody using unsynchronized (U) and mitotic cells (M) (see Fig. 4) isolated by shaking off cells from nocodazole-treated cultures. The shake-off procedure greatly enriched the population of mitotic cells, relative to nocodazole treatment alone. Using approximately the same amount of total I-2 protein in the samples, immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Thr72 demonstrated a 25-fold increase in I-2 phosphorylation at Thr72 in mitotic HeLa cells (Fig. 4). We prepared lysates from unsynchronized, mimosine-synchronized, or nocodazole-synchronized HeLa cells to determine whether increased I-2 (Thr72) phosphorylation during mitosis corresponded to an increase in kinase specific activity. These lysates were used as source of I-2 kinase activity. The same amount of lysate protein was incubated with recombinant I-2 plus MgATP. The results of the phosphorylation reactions were analyzed by Western blotting with the anti-phospho-Thr72 antibody (Fig. 5A). Unsynchronized cells displayed a low level of I-2 (Thr72) kinase activity. In contrast, little or no I-2 (Thr72) kinase activity was observed in lysates of mimosine-synchronized cells. Lysates from nocodazole-treated cells displayed significantly higher I-2 (Thr72) kinase activity, indicating that increased I-2 (Thr72) phosphorylation observed during mitosis resulted from the activation of a mitotic I-2 (Thr72) kinase. Studies with purified protein kinases have suggested that GSK3 is the most effective I-2 (Thr72) kinase. To test whether GSK3 was the major I-2 kinase in mitotic cells we assayed I-2 phosphorylation by mitotic cell lysates in the presence of kinase inhibitors. Addition of a known GSK3 inhibitor (3-(3-carboxy-4-chloroanilino)-4-(3-nitrophenyl)maleimide) had no effect on the I-2 Thr72 kinase activity of the mitotic cell lysates (Fig. 5B). Another GSK3 inhibitor (2-thio(3-iodobenzyl)-5-(1-pyridyl)(1,3,4)-oxadiazole) likewise had no effect (not shown). In contrast, roscovitine, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDK), decreased I-2 Thr72 phosphorylation by 60% (Fig. 5B). The results show that in mitotic cells phosphorylation of Thr72 in I-2 was not because of GSK3, but probably a CDK. Analysis of I-2 (Thr 72 ) Phosphorylation in Cells—HeLa cells were stained using immunohistochemistry with the phospho-Thr72 site-specific I-2 antibody (Fig. 6A). We demonstrated the specificity of this antibody in this protocol, in addition to the results seen in Fig. 2. Pre-mixing the antibody with 1 μm phospho-Thr72 I-2 abolished all the immunostaining (Fig. 6C), in contrast with pre-mixing with 1 μm unphosphorylated I-2, which had little effect on staining (Fig. 6E). DNA was stained using DAPI (shown in Fig. 6, B, D, and F) to show the alignment of condensed chromosomes at the metaphase plate, establishing that the stained cells were at the same stage of mitosis. Staining of HeLa cells with an I-2 antibody (Fig. 7A) and with the phospho-Thr72 antibody (Fig. 7B) revealed the most intense staining for phospho-Thr72 occurred at the centrosomes. This is highlighted in the merged images of total plus phospho-I-2 (panel C) and in the phospho-Thr72 minus total I-2 images (panel D). Quantitation of the phospho-Thr72 staining relative to total I-2 revealed that I-2 (Thr72) phosphorylation peaked in prophase cells and decreased as cells progressed through mitosis (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Phosphorylation of Thr72 in I-2 peaks during prophase and is localized to centrosomes. HeLa cells were analyzed by immunofluorescent microscopy utilizing antibodies to I-2 (panel A) and the phospho-Thr72 site I-2 (panel B). Panel C shows the merged image of panels A and B. Panel D shows the phospho-Thr72 image after subtracting the I-2 image (panel B minus panel A) to yield relative phosphorylation. The graph indicates the relative Thr72 phosphorylation at different phases of mitosis. Cells were assigned to different stages of mitosis based on the appearance of the DAPI-stained chromosomes. The data are the averages of three independent experiments (±S.E.) with 30 cells analyzed in each phase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mammalian PP1 activity is controlled by multiple regulatory subunits and inhibitor proteins. The most ancient of the PP1 regulators is I-2, called Glc8 in yeast, and the most highly conserved region of the protein surrounds the Thr-Pro phosphorylation site, with the sequence IDEPX TPY. Mutation of the corresponding residue Thr118 in yeast Glc8 prevents rescue of temperature-sensitive mutants of Ipl1 protein kinase, indicating that this phosphorylation site is important for function (13Tung H.Y.L. Wang W. Chan C.S.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 6064-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Numerous biochemical studies established that I-2 forms a 1:1 complex with the PP1 catalytic subunit to form a heterodimer termed MgATP-dependent phosphatase (2DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12144-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 310-324Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The activity of this latent heterodimer was transiently increased following the phosphorylation of I-2 at Thr72 by GSK3 (2DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12144-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 310-324Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4Yang S.D. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10231-10234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This proposed regulatory mechanism has remained controversial in part because previous studies have failed to demonstrate regulation of I-2 (Thr72) phosphorylation in vivo. In this study we produced a new experimental tool, namely an anti-phospho-Thr72 antibody, and showed I-2 becomes phosphorylated on Thr72 in living cells during mitosis. We also utilized gel mobility shifts and mass spectrometry to demonstrate that I-2 was phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle on three Ser residues. Our tests of kinase inhibitors indicate that GSK3, the best known I-2 kinase, contributes little to phosphorylation of I-2 during mitosis. Instead, the data point to other mitotic protein kinases. Roscovitine, a broad spectrum CDK inhibitor, blocked 60% of the I-2 (Thr72) kinase activity when used at a dose more than 10 times the IC50 for the purified cyclinB·cdc2 kinase complex. Thus, we conclude that one or more CDKs account for the majority of the mitotic I-2 (Thr72) kinase activity. Consistent with this finding, recent biochemical and genetic studies in yeast implicate PHO85, a cyclin-dependent protein kinase homologous to mammalian CDK5, as the sole kinase that phosphorylates Glc8 at the Thr118 site that is homologous to Thr72 (14Tan Y.S. Morcos P.A. Cannon J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 147-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, in HeLa cells there is another fraction of mitotic I-2 (Thr72) kinase that is resistant to roscovitine and as such is presumably distinct from the CDK family. Further work is required to establish the identity of this mitotic I-2 kinase. Timely changes in phosphorylation of mitotic substrates require precise coordination of protein kinase and phosphatase activities. Genetic evidence with yeast, other fungi, and fruit flies points to a critical role for PP1 in various aspects of mitosis (15Hisamoto N. Sugimoto K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3158-3165Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 16Doonan J.H. Morris N.R. Cell. 1989; 57: 987-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 17Ohkura H.

Inhibition of PP1 activity leads to premature mitotic entry (20Gliksman N.R. Parsons S.F. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Ghosh S.

Cell. 1992; 3: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In fungi and in mammals, PP1 activity appears particularly important for the metaphase-anaphase transition (16Doonan J.H. Morris N.R. Cell. 1989; 57: 987-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 23Ishii K. Kumada K. Toda T. Yanagida M.

However, the mechanisms that regulate PP1 activity during various stages of mitosis remain largely unknown. Interestingly, we found phosphorylation of I-2 (Thr72) rose and fell during stages of mitosis with a peak at prophase. This suggests a highly dynamic regulation of I-2 and its associated PP1. These results are consistent with prior studies that showed PP1 activity is suppressed at entry into mitosis but required for the metaphase-anaphase transition (24Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). PP1 activity in mammalian cells also seems to be suppressed during telophase, to promote cell spreading (24Fernandez A. Brautigan D.L. Lamb N.J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1421-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of I-2 on Thr72 may play a role in fluctuations in PP1 activity during the cell division cycle (2DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12144-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 150: 310-324Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16Doonan J.H.

Measuring the activity of any one of the many forms of PP1 present in cells (associated with I-2 or not) is a daunting task that would require physical separation, as well as specific substrates. The physiological function(s) of I-2 in mammalian cells is not well understood, and the presence of multiple pseudogenes has made gene deletion problematic. By demonstrating that I-2 (Thr72) phosphorylation at mitosis is highly focused at centrosomes, our data at least begin to point to a potential physiological role for this conserved modification. Our own recent evidence showed that I-2 is concentrated at centrosomes and associates in a complex with PP1 and the kinase Nek2. Overexpression of I-2 produced premature centrosome separation, consistent with activation of the Nek2 kinase (26Eto M. Elliott E. Prickett T.D. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44013-44020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Nek2 is of specific interest, because it is localized at centrosomes, and prior studies have implicated a role for the NEK2·PP1 complex in the coordinate control of the phosphorylation of the associated substrate, cNAP (27Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, this is not the only target for I-2 action in cells, because I-2 also associates with neurabin/ spinophilin, as well as a novel transmembrane Ser/Thr kinase called KPI-2 (28Terry-Lorenzo R.T.

Nature. 1990; 344: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) documented changes in the levels of I-2 during the cell cycle, with peak expression during mitosis, indicating a possible role for I-2 in mitosis. We speculate that phosphorylation of I-2 at Thr72 during mitosis plays a role in the control of centrosomes and maybe in other events at this critical stage of mammalian cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2098081852,"Nucleotide excision repair is a major pathway for repairing UV light-induced DNA damage in most organisms. Using insertional mutagenesis, we isolated a UV-sensitive mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that is blocked in the excision of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. The mutant is also sensitive to the alkylating agent, methyl methanesulphonate. We have cloned REX1, a novel gene that rescues the mutant. The gene is unusual in a eukaryotic organism in that it is predicted to encode two different proteins, a small protein (8.9 kDa) and a larger protein (31.8 kDa). Neither protein is homologous to known DNA repair proteins. Partial complementation is achieved with subclones of the gene encoding only the 8.9-kDa protein. The 8.9-kDa protein has homologues in many organisms including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis, and humans. The 31.8-kDa protein appears to be less conserved. These findings may be of general importance for DNA repair in other organisms."

The native enzyme had a molecular mass of 63 kDa with a subunit mass of 31.2 kDa. Activity of purified phosphonopyruvate hydrolase was Co2+-dependent and showed a pH optimum of 6.7–7.0.

Organophosphonates are a group of biogenic compounds characterized by the presence of a stable covalent carbon to phosphorus (C–P) 1The abbreviations used are: C–P, covalent carbon to phosphorus bond; PEP mutase, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphomutase; PPH, phosphonopyruvate hydrolase; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: C–P, covalent carbon to phosphorus bond; PEP mutase, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphomutase; PPH, phosphonopyruvate hydrolase; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. bond. Although they are believed to have originated before the earth's atmosphere became extensively oxygenated, C–P compounds have been isolated from a wide variety of extant life forms, and a significant percentage of biogenic phosphorus is believed to occur in the C–P linkage. Moreover a growing number of synthetic organophosphonates have found applications in industrial, agricultural, and domestic products and are ultimately disposed of to soils or natural waters. An understanding of C–P bond metabolism is thus a prerequisite to a fuller understanding of global biogeochemical phosphorus cycling. Four distinct bacterial enzymes are known to carry out the C–P bond cleavage reaction that is central to organophosphonate mineralization. The C–P lyase complex(es) has a broad substrate specificity (1Wanner B.L.

Biochem. 1995; 234: 225-230Google Scholar) are essentially specific to their respective substrates. A fourth C–P bond-metabolizing enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphomutase (PEP mutase), catalyzes the intramolecular rearrangement and interconversion of 3-phosphonopyruvate (COOH–CO–CH2–PO3H2) and phosphoenolpyruvate (COOH–C(=CH2)–O–PO3H2) (4Seidel H.M. Freeman S. Seto H. Knowles J.R. Nature. 1988; 335: 457-458Google Scholar). Phosphonopyruvate formation by this route is a key step in the biosynthesis of all known natural products that contain the C–P bond (5Ternan N.G. McGrath J.W. McMullan G. Quinn J.P. World J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1998; 14: 635-647Google Scholar). One of the most widely distributed of such biogenic C–P compounds is 2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid, commonly called phosphonoalanine (HOOC–CH(NH2)–CH2–PO3H2); it is formed through the transamination of phosphonopyruvate by many lower organisms, such as the sea anemone Zoanthus sociatus (6Kitteridge J.S. Hughes R.R. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 991-995Google Scholar) and the protozoan Tetrahymena pyriformis (7Horigane A. Horiguchi M. Matsumoto T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 618: 383-388Google Scholar). Our earlier studies on its biodegradation showed that 47 of 100 randomly chosen environmental bacterial isolates had the ability to utilize phosphonoalanine as sole phosphorus source for growth (8McGrath J.W. Ternan N.G. Quinn J.P. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 69-73Google Scholar). Subsequently Ternan et al. (9Ternan N.G. Hamilton J.T.G. Quinn J.P. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 35-41Google Scholar) reported the isolation of an environmental Burkholderia cepacia strain capable of growth on phosphonoalanine as sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Cell extracts of the isolate contained a previously unknown Pi-independent activity designated phosphonopyruvate hydrolase (PPH) that catalyzed the hydrolytic cleavage of the C–P bond of phosphonopyruvate to yield pyruvate and Pi (Fig. 1). We now describe the purification and properties of PPH from a soil isolate of a Variovorax sp. and the sequence analysis of the structural gene that encodes it. Intriguingly, the enzyme shares a common ancestry with PEP mutase, which is responsible for phosphonopyruvate biosynthesis (see above); the interaction of the two activities is thus likely to play an important regulatory role in global phosphorus cycling. Microorganism and Culture Conditions—Samples from soils, natural water bodies, and waste treatment installations in Northern Ireland were incubated in mineral salts medium (8McGrath J.W. Ternan N.G. Quinn J.P. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 69-73Google Scholar) with d,l-phosphonoalanine (5 mm) as sole carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus source for 5–7 days. Cultures were plated on the same medium solidified with agar, single colonies were isolated, and those that grew most rapidly were chosen for further study. Cells of Variovorax sp. Pal2 were routinely grown in batch culture at 30 °C on an orbital shaker at 100 rpm in mineral salts medium (8McGrath J.W. Ternan N.G. Quinn J.P. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 69-73Google Scholar) supplemented with 3 g pyruvate/liter and 2 g gluconate/liter as carbon sources, 5 mm NH4Cl as nitrogen source, and 0.5 mm phosphonoalanine as phosphorus source. Cells were harvested in mid-log phase by centrifugation, washed twice in 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, and stored at –20 °C. Synthesis of 3-Phosphonopyruvate—The trilithium salt of phosphonopyruvate was prepared according to the method of Sparkes et al. (10Sparkes M.J. Rogers K.L. Dixon H.B.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 373-376Google Scholar) by Chemical Synthesis Services, Belfast, Northern Ireland via chemical transamination of phosphonoalanine (Sigma) in the presence of Cu2+ and pyridine catalysts with glyoxylate as the amino group acceptor. The synthesis yielded a pale yellow solid, which was characterized by 31P and 1H NMR spectroscopy; this showed the material to be 3-phosphonopyruvate with a purity of 95% by 1H NMR and high pressure liquid chromatography. Enzyme Assay—PPH activity was assayed at 37 °C by measuring the amount of phosphate liberated from phosphonopyruvate. The assay mixture (1 ml) contained 100 μmol HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, 5 μmol phosphonopyruvate, and 5 μmol CoCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 25 μl of enzyme solution (0.1–0.3 μg of protein/ml) and terminated after 10 min by the addition of 200 μl of 3 m trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged, and the phosphate released was measured by the method of Fiske and Subbarrow (11Fiske C.H. Subbarrow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Google Scholar). Activities were expressed as units of 1.0 μmol of phosphate released per min (mean of three replicates). When required, pyruvate release was measured using a lactate dehydrogenase-based pyruvate test kit (Sigma). Protein Assay—Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) method with bovine albumin as standard (Pierce). Purification of Phosphonopyruvate Hydrolase—During enzyme purification all column chromatography steps, each lasting for no more than 2.5 h, were performed at room temperature. Collected fractions were removed to ice. For preparation of crude extract, the washed cells (∼15 g wet weight from 5 liters of the culture) were suspended in 65 ml of 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, and disrupted by sonication on ice for 6 min (30-s sonication followed by 2-min cooling) at 16 kHz. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was immediately used in the next step. For ammonium sulfate fractionation, the cell-free supernatant was fractionated in two steps by addition of solid ammonium sulfate at 20 °C and stirring for 1 h. The precipitate obtained between 2.1 and 3.1 m was collected by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) and dissolved in 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0. For hydrophobic interaction chromatography, the protein fraction obtained by salt precipitation was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose HP column (5.0 × 4.0 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 m (NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with 3 bed volumes of 0.5 m (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0. The proteins were eluted at 8 ml/min first with 0.1 m (NH4)2SO4 in 50 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0 (200 ml), and then the enzyme with the buffer alone (160 ml). Fractions containing active enzyme were pooled, concentrated, and desalted with 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, by ultrafiltration through a Vivaspin 15 concentrator (10,000 molecular weight cut-off) (Sartorius). For anion-exchange chromatography (column 1), the enzyme solution was applied to a Q-Sepharose HP anion-exchange column (1.6 × 4.8 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0. Proteins were eluted at 2.5 ml/min, applying an initial isocratic step in the equilibration buffer (27 ml) followed by a linear gradient of 0–0.2 m NaCl in the same buffer (80 ml). Fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl. For immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, the enzyme solution (1.1 ml) was applied to a chelating-Sepharose column (1.0 × 7.5 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Cu2+ and equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl. The column was washed with the same buffer (20 ml), and the bound proteins were eluted at 2 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NH4Cl in 25 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and desalted with 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.8, by ultrafiltration as before. For anion-exchange chromatography (column 2), the sample (1.1 ml) was applied to a Q-Sepharose HP column (1.0 × 4.5 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-KOH buffer, pH 7.8. The column was washed with the same buffer (10 ml), and the bound proteins were removed with a linear gradient of 0–0.2 m NaCl in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. PPH was eluted in a single major peak at about 0.19 m NaCl. The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated by ultra filtration as before and stored in aliquots with 25% glycerol at –20 °C. Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE used precast 8–16% Tris/glycine or NuPAGE BisTris gels in an X cell 11 mini-cell with Mark 12 molecular mass standards (Invitrogen). Gels were stained with EZBlue gel staining reagent (Sigma) or the SilverQuest kit (Invitrogen). Electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions used precast 8–16% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Enzyme activity was located by immersion of the gel for 15 min at 37 °C in the phosphonopyruvate hydrolase assay mixture and then detecting the phosphate released with the Fiske and Subbarrow reagent (see above); the enzyme's activity was manifested by a blue band. Protein was detected using the EZBlue reagent (Sigma). Size Exclusion Chromatography—This was performed using an Ultraspherogel SEC 3,000 column (Beckman Coulter) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.25 m NaCl, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Gel Electrofocusing—Isoelectric focusing gels at pH 3–7 (Invitrogen) were used with pI standards (VWR International). Protein Sequencing—Approximately 50 μg of dried enzyme was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid (35 μl) and water (15 μl), and a small crystal of CNBr was added. After incubation at room temperature for 24 h the sample was lyophilized and dissolved in 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Pure enzyme and its CNBr fragments were separated in NuPAGE BisTris gels (Invitrogen) and blotted by the semi-dry method onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ProBlot; Applied Biosystems) using 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11.0, containing 10% methanol. Protein bands were visualized by EZBlue (Sigma) staining and excised. Automated Edman sequencing was performed by the Microchemical Facility, The Babraham Institute (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Mass Spectrometry—This was carried out with a Voyager-DE matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight system (PerSeptive Biosystems). Enzyme Stability—The effect of temperature on the stability of PPH was determined by exposure of the reaction mixture without substrate at temperatures from 30 to 75 °C for 10 min prior to performing the assay. Effect of pH—The pH optimum was determined using the standard assay with different sets of 100 mm buffers as follows: sodium succinate/NaOH, pH 3.5–5.5, MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0–8.0, HEPES/KOH, pH 6.4–7.4, and H3BO3/NaOH, pH 8.0–10.0. Effect of Temperature—PPH activity was assayed at different temperatures over the range from 0 to 60 °C. Effect of Metal Ions—The effect of metal ions on purified enzyme that had been dialyzed was tested by the addition of EDTA (1 mm) for 1 h at 0 °C to the reaction mixture and then incubating different metal ions (5 mm final concentration) for 5 min at 37 °C prior to measuring activity. The activity in the dialyzed preparation was 61 units/mg, and after EDTA treatment this fell to 30 units/mg; all activities were compared with the latter value. Determination of Kinetic Parameters—Vmax and Km of the purified enzyme were estimated for phosphonopyruvate by using concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 25.0 mm. Activity was measured at 37 °C as described above. Cloning and Analysis of the pphA Gene—General DNA isolation and manipulation techniques were carried out following published protocols (12Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Restriction endonuclease digestions and ligations with T4 DNA ligase were performed as recommended by the enzymes' suppliers (Amersham Biosciences and Sigma). Plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega) was used for cloning of the PCR fragments. Plasmids pUC18 and pUC19 containing inserts from the pphA gene region and PCR fragments were used as templates for the CEQ DTCS Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit (Beckman Coulter). DNA sequences were obtained using an automatic DNA sequencer (CEQ2000; Beckman Coulter). The nucleotide sequences of both strands were determined. Initial computer analysis of the sequences was performed using the DNASIS V2.6 (Hitachi) software package. The alignment of sequences was performed by using ClustalW (13Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar) with parameters set at default values. On the basis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, a forward oligonucleotide primer was designed: 5′-TTYACNGCNATGGCNGCNCACAA-3′ (JQ102). A reverse primer was designed using the sequence of the internal 17.4-kDa polypeptide: 5′-TTNGGRAANGTYTTRTCYTCCAT-3′ (JQ111). A 300-bp fragment of the pphA gene was amplified by PCR, using total Variovorax sp. Pal2 genomic DNA and primers JQ102 and JQ111. The reaction was carried out in a volume of 25 μl with concentrations of deoxynucleotide triphosphates at 200 μm and the JQ102 and JQ111 primers at 0.15 μm each. The following temperature profile was used: initial denaturing at 95 °C for 1 min and then 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30s, 60 °C for 30s, and 70 °C for 30s. Subsequently the 300 bp pphA gene fragment was used as a probe for Southern hybridization. To clone the complete pphA gene, hybridization experiments were set up with SacI, SalI, SmaI, and PstI digests of total Variovorax sp. Pal2 DNA. DNA fragments were transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by Southern blotting, and the membranes were then treated according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Hybridization probes were labeled using the Gene Images Random Prime Labeling and Detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was carried out at 64 °C, and detection was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Based on the results of these experiments libraries of 3–4-kbp SacI and 2.5–3.5-kbp SmaI fragments of Variovorax sp. Pal2 DNA were constructed in pUC18 and pUC19 vectors, respectively. Clones containing fragments with the pphA gene were identified by colony hybridization with the same fluorescein labeled 300-bp fragment probe. 16 S rRNA Gene Sequencing Analysis—An almost complete 16 S rRNA gene from isolate Pal2 was amplified by PCR with the universal primers described by Pascual et al. (14Pascual C. Lawson P.A. Farrow J.A.E. Gimenez M.N. Collins M.D. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1995; 45: 724-728Google Scholar). Sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene and its analysis were carried out as described previously (15Kulakov L.A. McAlister M.B. Ogden K.L. Larkin M.J. O'Hanlon J.F. Appl. Envir. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 1548-1555Google Scholar, 16.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Isolation of Variovorax sp. Strain Pal2—A program of enrichment culture on d,l-phosphonoalanine was carried out using samples from local soils, natural water bodies, and waste treatment installations. Bacterial strains capable of metabolizing the compound as sole carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus source were obtained from all six sites sampled; the isolates were found to utilize only the l-enantiomer of phosphonoalanine. A small number of isolates were also obtained that were capable of growing on phosphonopyruvate, the transamination product of phosphonoalanine, as the sole carbon and phosphorus source. Enzyme assays carried out on crude extracts of the cultures demonstrated that each strain contained PPH activity, which was inducible in the presence of phosphonoalanine or phosphonopyruvate or both. Induction of the enzyme was not repressed in any isolate by the presence of phosphate. The bacterial strain, designated Pal2, that grew most quickly on phosphonoalanine was chosen for further study; it was identified by 16 S rDNA sequence as a Variovorax sp. Purification of PPH—Initial studies on cell extracts from Variovorax sp. Pal2 revealed a 20% loss in activity on storage at room temperature for 24 h. It was therefore necessary to minimize exposure to higher temperatures and all chromatography fractions were collected, on ice. A five-step procedure was developed to obtain pure enzyme; this employed a combination of salt precipitation and chromatography using hydrophobic interaction, immobilized metal affinity, and anion exchange (Table I). The PPH was purified 189-fold (with a 19% yield) and had a specific activity of 163 units/mg of protein. Enzyme prepared in this way migrated as a single protein band of 31.5 kDa on silver-stained SDS-containing electrophoresis gels (Fig. 2a). When non-denaturing Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels were used the PPH activity was found to coincide with the single band observed on Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2b).Table IPurification of phosphonopyruvate hydrolaseProcedureVolumeTotal unitsProteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationmlunitsmg/mlunits/mg%Crude extract60.5271.05.20.861001(NH4)2SO435.0243.04.11.7902Phenyl-Sepharose15.0aVolume after concentration by ultrafiltration.170.81.637.0708Q-Sepharose, pH 7.04.0aVolume after concentration by ultrafiltration.148.00.941.06148Chelating Sepharose (Cu2+)1.1aVolume after concentration by ultrafiltration.93.91.270.03581Q-Sepharose, pH 7.81.1aVolume after concentration by ultrafiltration.51.90.32163.019189a Volume after concentration by ultrafiltration. Open table in a new tab The Structure of PPH—The enzyme had a molecular mass of 31.187 kDa determined by mass spectrometry and 63 kDa by size exclusion chromatography under non-denaturing conditions. This indicates that PPH is a dimer. The pI of the purified protein was 5.35. The N-terminal sequences of the complete polypeptide and two internal fragments generated by CNBr (20.4 and 17.4 kDa) were determined (Table II).Table IISequences of the amino terminus and CNBr-derived peptidesSampleAmino acid sequencea(M), methionine was presumed to be the amino acid residue preceding the CNBr cleavage sites.Complete polypeptideMTKNQALRAALDSGRLFTAMAAHNPLVA*bSegments used for the design of oligonucleotides for PCR are underlined.20.4-kDa fragment(M)RAIASTVSIPLIADIDT17.4-kDa fragment(M)EDKTFPKDTSLRTDGRQELVRIIEFQGa (M), methionine was presumed to be the amino acid residue preceding the CNBr cleavage sites.b Segments used for the design of oligonucleotides for PCR are underlined. Open table in a new tab The Stability of PPH—The effect of heat on the enzyme showed that activity was lost after an exposure of 10 min to 50 °C. The stability of pure enzyme during storage was increased by inclusion of 25% glycerol, and after 6 months of storage at –20 °C the loss in activity was ∼20%. The Effects of pH, Temperature, and Metal Ions on Activity— The influence of pH on the reaction was examined over the pH range from 3.5 to 10.0, and an optimum of about 7.0 was found. The effect of temperature was also determined, and 37 °C was selected for routine use. As the hydrolases described for other phosphonate compounds were shown to be metalloproteins (2La Nauze J.M. Rosenberg H. Shaw D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 212: 332-350Google Scholar, 3McGrath J.W. Wisdom G.B. McMullan G. Larkin M.J. Quinn J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 225-230Google Scholar), the effect of EDTA treatment and metal ion addition to the dialyzed enzyme were investigated (Table III). Exposure to EDTA reduced activity by about 50%. Co2+ and, to some extent, Ni2+ and Mg2+, was found to restore PPH activity. Cs2+ and Ca2+ had no effect, whereas Mn2+ and Cu2+ reduced the activity by 41 and 45%, respectively. These results suggest the enzyme is dependent on Co2+, and this ion was included in the assay mixtures.Table IIIEffect of metal ions on phosphonopyruvate hydrolase activityMetal (5.0 mM)PPH activity%None100Cobalt227Nickel154Magnesium143Cesium96Calcium95Manganese59Copper55 Open table in a new tab Kinetics and Specificity—The stoichiometry of the catalyzed reaction was confirmed by the equimolar release of pyruvate and phosphate from phosphonopyruvate with the purified enzyme. The ability of the enzyme to catalyze the intramolecular rearrangement of phosphonopyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate was examined using the coupled ADP-pyruvate kinase-NADH-lactate dehydrogenase system of Nakashita et al. (17Nakashita H. Shimazu A. Hidaka T. Seto H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6857-6861Google Scholar); this revealed a rate of phosphoenolpyruvate formation some 1000-fold lower than that of pyruvate and Pi. Phosphoenolpyruvate did not itself serve as a substrate for phosphonopyruvate hydrolase. In addition, some small phosphatase substrates (glycerophosphate, phospho-l-serine, and phosphoglycolic acid) were examined as possible PPH substrates; none were hydrolyzed. Of 20 phosphonate compounds tested activity was detected only with phosphonopyruvate. The possible inhibitory effects of the other 18 compounds on the purified enzyme were also studied (Table IV). It was found that only 3-phosphonopropionic acid (17%), hydroxymethylphosphonic acid (25%), and phosphonoformic acid (73%) caused significant inhibition (at 5 mm). As in the case of the phosphonoacetate hydrolase (3McGrath J.W. Wisdom G.B. McMullan G. Larkin M.J. Quinn J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 225-230Google Scholar), Pi did not inhibit the reaction. The enzyme had an apparent Km of 0.53 mm for its sole substrate, phosphonopyruvate, and a Vmax of 202 units per mg of protein.Table IVEffect of addition of non-substrate phosphonate compounds on phosphonopyruvate hydrolase activityPhosphonate (5 mM)Relative activitya100% activity was 119 units/mg of protein.

Activity values are the means of duplicate determinations. Open table in a new tab Nucleotide Sequence Analysis of the pphA Gene—N-terminal amino acid sequences of PPH and its fragments produced by CNBr fragmentation were used to design primers for analysis of the PPH (pphA) locus (Table II). PCR reactions with JQ102 and JQ111 primers yielded a fragment of 300 bp, which was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and analyzed. This fragment was subsequently used as a hybridization probe for detection of pphA fragments and clones. Two clones containing the pphA gene region were identified. These were pPPH5 (which contained a 3.4-kb SacI fragment) and pUPH11 (containing a 3.0-kb SmaI fragment). The nucleotide sequence of the pphA gene was determined. This gene encodes a putative PPH protein of 290 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 31,177 Da. This is in good correspondence with the molecular mass obtained for the purified PPH by mass spectrometry. The N-terminal sequences of the PPH protein and the two of its CNBr fragments corresponded to translated amino acid sequences of pphA. The start codon of the pphA gene was unequivocally identified by comparison with the PPH N-terminal amino acid sequence. To further confirm that the cloned gene encodes phosphonopyruvate hydrolase, cell extracts from cultures of Escherichia coli JM109 containing plasmids pPPH5, pUPH11, and pUC18 (negative control) were prepared and analyzed for PPH activity. Specific activities of 0.65 units/mg and 0.2 units/mg of protein were found in cells that contained pPPH5 and pUPH11, respectively. No PPH activity was found in the negative control. Data base searches of GenBank™ and EMBL with the BLAST program (18Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Google Scholar) and homology analyses showed that the PPH protein has similarities with a number of members of the PEP mutase superfamily. The highest scores were with PEP mutases from T. pyriformis (19Nakashita H. Kozuka K. Hidaka T. Hara O. Seto H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 159-162Google Scholar) (41% amino acid sequence identity) and Mytilus edulis (20Jia Y. Lu Z. Huang K. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14165-14173Google Scholar, 21Huang L.Z. Jia Y. Dunaway-Mariano D. Herzberg O. Struct. Folding Des. 1999; 7: 539-548Google Scholar) (40% identity). A slightly lower level of identity (38%) was found with the bacterial PEP mutase from Streptomyces viridochromogenes. Even less pronounced similarities were found between PPH and 2-methylisocitrate lyase from Salmonella typhimurium (32% identity) and isocitrate lyase of E. coli (20% identity) (Fig. 3). Alignment of the PPH sequence with several proteins belonging to the PEP mutase superfamily is presented in Fig. 3. The conserved residues in various groups of the superfamily and the active site residues of M. edulis PEP mutase are shown as described by Dunaway-Mariano and co-workers (20Jia Y. Lu Z. Huang K. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14165-14173Google Scholar). Although there are only moderate levels of similarity between PPH and the PEP mutase superfamily proteins, there is a good conservation of amino acid residues between PPH and PEP mutases in several regions (Fig. 3, positions 72–99, 152–165, 188–198, 230–240, 278–295, and 355–360). It is particularly notable that most of the amino acid residues that comprise the active site of M. edulis PEP mutase (20Jia Y. Lu Z. Huang K. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14165-14173Google Scholar) are conserved in PPH from Variovorax sp. Pal2. Phosphonopyruvate is produced biogenically through the rearrangement of the high energy phosphate ester phosphoenol-pyruvate by PEP mutase, the major C–P bond-forming enzyme identified to date. Thus the compound is central to the formation of all natural phosphonates. In some organisms phosphonopyruvate may subsequently be aminated to phosphonoalanine (22Nakashita H. Watanabe K. Hara O. Hidaka T. Seto H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 212-219Google Scholar); however, the initial step in all of the major biosynthetic pathways of phosphonate natural products is believed to be its decarboxylation to phosphonoacetaldehyde by phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase (22Nakashita H. Watanabe K. Hara O. Hidaka T. Seto H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1997; 50: 212-219Google Scholar). Because the equilibrium of the reaction carried out by PEP mutase lies strongly toward phosphoenolpyruvate this decarboxylation serves to drive the reaction in the direction of C–P bond formation (23Seidel H.M. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5641-5646Google Scholar). Consistent with this suggestion is the apparent translational coupling of the expression of the PEP mutase and phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase genes observed in the phosphinothricin tripeptide-producing strain S. viridochromogenes (24Schwartz D. Recktenwald J. Pelzer S. Wohlleben W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 149-157Google Scholar) and the bialaphos-producing Streptomyces hygroscopicus (19Nakashita H. Kozuka K. Hidaka T. Hara O. Seto H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 159-162Google Scholar). The existence of PPH, a novel C–P bond cleavage enzyme of apparently unique substrate specificity whose purification and properties we now report, clearly indicates the possibility of an alternative metabolic fate for phosphonopyruvate; indeed the activity of this enzyme has now been demonstrated by us in cell extracts of a range of environmental bacteria capable of the utilization of phosphonoalanine as sole carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus source or of phosphonopyruvate itself as sole carbon and phosphorus source (results not shown). PPH is the third substrate-specific bacterial phosphonohydrolase capable of heterolytic C–P bond cleavage to be described to date. In its requirement for a divalent metal ion it has similarities to many phosphoryl transferring enzymes including the C–P hydrolases specific to phosphonoacetate (3McGrath J.W. Wisdom G.B. McMullan G. Larkin M.J. Quinn J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 225-230Google Scholar) and phosphonoacetaldehyde (25Morais M.C. Baker A.S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 206-209Google Scholar); the former is zinc-dependent whereas in the latter magnesium is a cofactor in a mechanism that involves both an active site nucleophile and formation of a Schiff-base intermediate (25Morais M.C. Baker A.S. Dunaway-Mariano D. Allen K.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 206-209Google Scholar). PPH is also similar to the other two hydrolases in its homodimeric structure. However, the subunit sizes are different; the phosphonoacetate hydrolase is 30 kDa whereas the phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase is 40 kDa. Analysis of the corresponding sequences of the three enzymes suggests, however, that they have very different ancestries. Thus whereas phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase belongs to the haloacid dehalogenase family that includes several phosphohydrolases (26Baker A.S. Ciocci M.J. Metcalf W.W. Kim J.-B. Babbitt P.C. Wanner B.L. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9305-9315Google Scholar), and phosphonoacetate hydrolase is a member of the alkaline phosphatase superfamily of zinc-dependent hydrolases (27Galperin M.Y. Bairoch A. Koonin E.V. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1829-1935Google Scholar), PPH shows strong homology (Fig. 3) to the members of a recently identified α/β-barrel enzyme superfamily (20Jia Y. Lu Z. Huang K. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14165-14173Google Scholar) that contains isocitrate lyase and PEP mutase. Unsurprisingly, in view of their common substrate, PPH showed highest levels of amino acid sequence identity with the PEP mutases; in particular the active site residues identified in the PEP mutase of the marine mussel M. edulis (28Kim A. Kim J. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4443-4448Google Scholar) are highly conserved in PPH, as they are in other members of the super-family (20Jia Y. Lu Z. Huang K. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14165-14173Google Scholar). These amino acids include the Lys-120 and Asp-58 of the M. edulis enzyme that have been implicated in phosphoryl group activation and transfer (20Jia Y. Lu Z. Huang K. Herzberg O. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14165-14173Google Scholar). Significantly, too, PPH displays a very weak ability to convert phosphonopyruvate to PEP (however it is unable to release Pi from the latter). The fact that the highest degree of homology was found between the PPH of Variovorax sp. Pal2 and the PEP mutases from the lower eukaryotes M. edulis and T. pyriformis would appear to confirm the ancient origin of both enzymes. Further studies should reveal the precise way in which their two active sites have diverged to support their differing roles in phosphonate metabolism. Another intriguing question concerns the interaction of the two activities when they occur in the same cell, whereas the metabolic relationship of each with phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase also requires clarification. We greatly appreciate the help of G. J. Allen with various techniques. We are grateful to J. Lawson for performing the size exclusion chromatography and Dr. Amanda Cross for carrying out the mass spectrometry. We also thank Professor D. Dunaway-Mariano for advice and encouragement in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2057258241,"Whether deletion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 or 2 affects lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated signaling is not understood. In this report, we used macrophages derived from wild type (wt) mice and from mice null for the type 1 receptor (p60–/–), the type 2 receptor (p80–/–), or both (p60–/– p80–/–) to investigate the effect of these receptors on LPS-mediated activation of NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and apoptosis. LPS activated NF-κB by 3–4-fold in wt cells but by 9–10-fold in p60–/–, p80–/–, and p60–/– p80–/– macrophages. These results correlated with the IκBα kinase activation, which is needed for NF-κB activation. LPS-induced cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible NO synthase proteins and NO production were maximum in p60–/– p80–/– macrophages and minimum in wt cells. LPS activated C-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38MAPK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase in wt cells, but the levels were much higher in p60–/–, p80–/–, and p60–/– p80–/– cells. LPS-induced cytotoxicity, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and annexin V staining were also highest in p60–/– p80–/– cells and lowest in wt cells. The difference in LPS signaling was unrelated to the expression of LPS receptors, CD14, or toll-like receptor 4. Overall, our studies indicate that deletion of either of the TNF receptors sensitizes the macrophages to LPS and provide evidence for cross-talk between TNF and LPS signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2087801840,"GSY1 is one of the two genes encoding glycogen synthase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both the GSY1 message and the protein levels increased as cells approached stationary phase. A combination of deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis revealed a complex promoter containing multiple positive and negative regulatory elements. Expression of GSY1 was dependent upon the presence of a TATA box and two stress response elements (STREs). Expression was repressed by Mig1, which mediates responses to glucose, and Rox1, which mediates responses to oxygen. Characterization of the GSY1 promoter also revealed a novel negative element. This element, N1, can repress expression driven by either an STRE or a heterologous element, the UAS of CYC1. Repression by N1 is dependent on the number of these elements that are present, but is independent of their orientation. N1 repressed expression when placed either upstream or downstream of the UAS, although the latter position is more effective.

This complexity may allow GSY1 to respond to a wide range of environmental stresses. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is exposed to a wide variety of environmental stressors, such as growth into stationary phase, heat shock, and osmotic shock. Cells respond to these stressors by modifying many metabolic processes, presumably making cells more resistant to these stressors. Among these changes are increased activities of the glycogen metabolic enzymes and the deposition of glycogen up to 23% of the dry weight of the cell (see below). Glycogen metabolism is highly conserved from yeast to mammals. The regulation of glycogen metabolism in S. cerevisiae closely parallels the more extensively studied counterparts in mammals (1Lillie S.H. Pringle J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1384-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Roach P.J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Regulation is mediated primarily by effects on the activities of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase. These enzymes are regulated, in part, by protein phosphorylation. Cyclic AMP appears to play a central role in the regulation of these enzymes in S. cerevisiae, as it does in mammals, although the precise mechanisms remain to be identified. The parallels between glycogen metabolism in S. cerevisiae and mammals extends to the level of protein sequence. Glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase from this yeast and mammals are 50 and 49% identical, respectively (3Farkas I. Hardy T.A. DePauli-Roach A.A. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20879-20886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Farkas I. Hardy T.A. Goebl M.G. Roach P.J. J. Biol.

Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1986; 324: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Glycogen metabolism is also regulated at the level of gene expression in S. cerevisiae. The protein levels of the enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism increase in parallel with glycogen accumulation as cells approach stationary phase or when nutrients are depleted (7Becker J.-U. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 447-454PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rothman-Denes L.B. Cabib E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This increase in the level of glycogen metabolic enzyme activity appears to result, in part, from the regulation at the level of transcription. Northern blot analysis has shown that the levels of mRNA expressed from GPH1 (encoding glycogen phosphorylase), GLC3 (glycogen branching enzyme), GAC1 (glycogen-binding subunit of protein phosphatase 1), and GSY2 (glycogen synthase) increase as cells progress from log phase to stationary phase (9Hwang P.K. Tugendreich S. Fletterick R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1659-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Rowen D.W. Meinke M. LaPorte D.C. Mol. Cell.

The simultaneous increases in mRNA levels of the proteins involved in glycogen metabolism suggest that the expression of these genes may be coordinately regulated. Our long term goal is to understand how glycogen metabolism is regulated at the level of gene expression and how these regulatory processes are coordinated with post-translational control of the glycogen metabolic enzymes. The first step toward this goal is to characterize the promoters for these genes. In this paper, we report a characterization of the promoter of GSY1 (glycogen synthase). This is a surprisingly complex promoter that allows transcription to respond to a wide variety of cellular stressors. Materials—Restriction enzymes, other DNA modification enzymes and oligonucleotides linkers were purchased from Invitrogen or New England Biolabs. Radiochemicals were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Amersham, Amplitaq polymerase for PCR from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and sequencing reagents from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Oligonucleotide primers were products of National BioSciences, Inc. or Invitrogen. The frozen E-Z transformation kit was purchased from Zymo Research, Orange, CA. All other reagents were of the purest grades available. Isolation of the GSY1 Clone—GSY1, the gene encoding yeast glycogen synthase, was isolated as described by Meinke in 1993 (13Meinke, M. H. (1993) Regulation of Expression of a Gene for Glycogen Synthase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph.D. thesis, University of MinnesotaGoogle Scholar). Briefly, glycogen synthase was purified from strain S288C cells grown on YPD medium. The purified protein was reduced, carboxymethylated, and digested with trypsin. Two peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, their sequences were determined, and oligonucleotide probes were prepared. GSY1 was isolated following screening of a yeast genomic library in λ dash (Stratagene Cloning Systems) by plaque hybridization. The identities of the clones were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis and they were recloned as SalI fragments into plasmid vector pSEY18 (14Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garrett J. Geller B.L. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Yeast Methods—Yeast strains were manipulated by standard methods unless indicated otherwise (15Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985Google Scholar). Transformation of linear DNA fragments was done by either the lithium acetate transformation method (16Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar) or using the E-Z yeast transformation kit supplied by Zymo Research, Inc. Northern analysis was performed by standard procedures (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). Constructs were transferred to the CAN1 locus of the chromosome, unless otherwise noted. Transfer was accomplished using the integrating plasmid pRL95 (12Ni H.T. LaPorte D.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Rowen, D. W. (1992) GLC3: The Gene Encoding the Glycogen Branching Enzyme of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ph.D thesis, University of MinnesotaGoogle Scholar). This vector includes two fragments of the CAN1 gene. Digestion with a restriction enzyme that cuts between these segments produces a linear fragment that will integrate into the CAN1 locus, replacing the resident sequences and producing a stable, single-copy integrant. Integrants were selected as uracil prototrophs (because of the URA3 gene carried by the vector) and then confirmed by resistance to canavanine plates and sensitivity to 5-fluoroorotic acid. Culture Conditions—Yeast cells were grown either in YPD (2% glucose, 2% peptone, and 1% yeast extract) or in SD media (2% glucose, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 0.17% yeast nitrogen base minus the amino acids) supplemented with the appropriate nutritional requirements (15Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985Google Scholar). 5-Fluoroorotic acid plates were prepared as described (19Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). SD + CAN plates contained SD supplemented with canavanine at a concentration of 60 μg/ml (20Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). GSY1 expression was routinely induced by growth into early stationary phase. Growth was monitored by light scattering at 600 nm. Cultures were grown at 30 °C and samples were taken at early log phase (A 600 between 0.05 and 0.15) or in early stationary phase (14–18 h later). For heat shock experiments, 250-ml cultures were grown at 21 °C to an A 600 of 0.1 to 0.2. Then 100 ml was transferred into each of the two flasks. One flask was shaken at 21 °C and the other at 37 °C. The remainder was harvested. The control and the heat-shocked samples were collected 1 h later. Induction was assayed by measuring β-galactosidase activity (see below). Construction of the GSY1:lacZ Fusion—The coding sequence of GSY1 was digested with BstBI (which cleaves at base +31 relative to translational start); the ends were filled with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and BamHI linkers were attached. The EcoRI-BamHI fragment, which includes the 5′ end of GSY1, was inserted into plasmid YCp50 (21Rose M.D. Novick P. Thomas J.H. Botstein D. Fink G.R. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). A lacZ gene fusion cassette, derived from pMC1871 (22Casadaban M.J. Martinez-Arias A. Shapira S.K. Chou J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 293-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) was then inserted into the BamHI site. The resulting plasmid carries a GSY1:lacZ fusion gene that includes the first 31 bp of the GSY1 structural gene fused in-frame with the lacZ gene and has 1700 bp of GSY1 upstream sequences. This fusion was subcloned into the integration vector, pRL95, to give pUL5. Construction of Deletions and Point Mutations—Plasmid pUL5 was used for constructing deletions or mutations in GSY1. Deletions were made using available restriction sites. Site-directed mutagenesis of the potential cis-elements was performed with the Clontech Transformer Mutagenesis Kit. Escherichia coli strain BMH17–81 was used for the initial amplification after mutagenesis. A 1.7-kb GSY1 upstream sequence from pUL5 was subcloned into a pT3/T7α-18 vector. The strategy employed for mutagenesis resulted in the conversion of the putative cis-element to a unique restriction site (absent in the original vector) and this allowed rapid screening for the mutants, which were then verified by sequencing with Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The mutated upstream sequence was then used to replace the corresponding wild-type sequences in pUL5. The resulting plasmid was integrated into the yeast chromosome, as described above.

The tubes were then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature over a period of 3–4 h. The stress response element (STRE) 1The abbreviation used is: STRE, stress response element.-1 of GSY1 and the surrounding sequences (–422 bp to –354 bp) were subcloned upstream of a basal CYC1:lacZ promoter. Double stranded N1 oligonucleotide was ligated into restriction sites either 34 bp downstream (NheI) or 54 bp upstream (XbaI) of the STRE-1 sequence. The constructs were identified by sequencing. Following integration of these constructs into the CAN1 locus, these strains were grown in SDc-ura and activity was measured in early log phase cultures and in stationary phase cultures. The CYC1-UAS is composed of sites for HAP1 and HAP 2/3/4. The CYC1-UAS from plasmid pLG-312 (23Guarente L. Mason T. Cell. 1983; 32: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) was subcloned upstream of a basal CYC1:lacZ fusion. N1 was then ligated into restriction sites either 38 bp downstream of the HAP 2/3/4 site (XbaI) or 53 bp upstream of the HAP1 (SmaI) site of the CYC1-UAS. Following integration of these constructs into the CAN1 locus, these strains were grown in YPLactate to an early log phase and cells were collected for activity measurements at an A 600 of 0.2–0.3. Primer Extension—Primer extension analysis was performed with slight modifications of a published procedure (24Wilson H.R. Archer C.D. Liu J. Turnbough Jr., C.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 514-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was obtained at the indicated time points from strain YRL40 bearing either GSY1:lacZ on a multicopy plasmid or the control vector plasmid, YEP24. An oligonucleotide hybridizing to the lacZ sequence (+54 to +72 bp relative to the translational start site of GSY1:lacZ fusion) was used as a primer and was 5′ end-labeled using radioactive [γ-32P]ATP. Forty μg of RNA was mixed with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5′-end labeled probe (7 × 106 cpm) and the final reaction volume was adjusted to 25 μl with water. This sample was heated to 90 °C, cooled to 50 °C and 25 μl of 2× RT mixture (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 12 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm each dNTP) and 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase were added to the mixture. The sample was then allowed to incubate at 42 °C for 90 min. The products were analyzed on an 8% polyacrylamide-urea gel. The start sites of GSY1 were determined by comparison with a DNA-sequencing ladder that was run alongside the products of primer extension. The sequencing reactions were carried out using the same primer as that for primer extension. β-Galactosidase Assay—Yeast cell samples were collected by rapid filtration and quick-frozen on dry ice. To carry out the β-galactosidase assay, the pellet was thawed and resuspended in Z-buffer (100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were disrupted by vortexing in the presence of glass beads and the protein extract was obtained by centrifugation. The extract was then incubated at 30 °C with o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside and absorbance was measured at 420 nm (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. β-Galactosidase activities are normalized for the protein concentration in the cell extract. Specific activities reported are the average of three or more independent experiments. At least two independent isolates were used for each construct. In all cases, S.E. ± mean was below 15% of the value shown. Mobility Shift Assay—Yeast strain YRL40 was grown in 100 ml of YPD medium to an A 600 of 1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in extraction buffer (0.2 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 400 mm ammonium sulfate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and then resuspended in 200 μl of extraction buffer. Samples were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 0.75 ml of glass beads and frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. After thawing the tubes, they were vortexed in the cold room for 20 min. 100 μl of extraction buffer was added and the samples were centrifuged to remove glass beads and larger cell debris. The supernatant was isolated and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 70%. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 300 μl of 10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20% glycerol. Samples were dialyzed twice against 500 ml of the same buffer for 2 h each. The dialyzed extracts were centrifuged, and supernatants were aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. The double stranded N1 oligonucleotide was end-labeled using T4-polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The sample was then passed through a G-25 column to remove excess labeled ATP. The binding reactions were carried out in a final volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl of 10× DNA binding buffer (0.2 m Hepes, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 m KCl), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 μl of 80% glycerol, and 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC). A typical reaction contained 120,000 cpm (30.8 fmol or 0.2 ng) of end-labeled probe and 30 μg of yeast extract. Following incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the samples were electrophoresed on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25× TBE (Tris borate/EDTA) and 5% glycerol, for 3.5 h at 4 °C. Competition experiments were performed using unlabeled N1, unlabeled N1m2 (a version of the N1 double stranded oligonucleotide in which all nucleotides in the N1 region have been changed), and salmon sperm DNA. The N1 was CTAGCGGCTACTCAGGGACC ATTTG and the N1m2 CTAGCGGCTtagactatcagATTTG. Regulation of GSY1 Expression by Growth Phase—The enzymatic activity of yeast glycogen synthase increases substantially as cultures approach stationary phase (8Rothman-Denes L.B. Cabib E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This increase in activity could be because of a change in the phosphorylation state of the glycogen synthase protein and/or to an increase in the protein level as cells approach stationary phase. To resolve this issue, a GSY1:lacZ fusion gene containing 1700 bp of upstream GSY1 sequence was constructed and inserted into the chromosome of wild-type strain YRL40. The activity of this reporter was low in the early log phase of growth, an increase could be seen as early as the mid-log phase and eventually a 7–8-fold increase was seen upon entry into stationary phase of growth (Fig. 1). (Unless otherwise indicated, growth to stationary phase was used as the standard method for induction of GSY1 expression in this study.) The level of the GSY1 mRNA also increased as the culture entered stationary phase (not shown), suggesting that induction probably occurred at the level of transcription. Localization of the Transcriptional Start Site—The transcriptional start site of GSY1 was identified by primer extension analysis (Fig 2A). A single major start site was identified, 90 bp upstream of the start of the open reading frame, along with multiple (10 or more) minor start sites. Multiple start sites have been observed for other genes in yeast (27Hahn S. Hoar E.T. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8562-8566Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 28Nagawa S. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8557-8561Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All map positions in this paper are given relative to the major start site of GSY1 transcription. The sequence TATAAA, which is an exact match with the consensus for TATA elements, was identified at –81 bp relative to the major transcriptional start site of GSY1. When this putative TATA sequence was mutated to TtcAAA, there was a 7-fold drop in the expression of GSY1 in both log and stationary phase cells (Fig. 2B). However, the fold induction was still comparable with that of the wild-type. It appears that this sequence is a functional TATA element and that this element is not directly involved with regulation in response to growth state. GSY1 Expression and Induction Requires STREs and Intact MSN2 and MSN4 Genes—In previous studies, we found that GPH1 and GSY2, which encode glycogen phosphorylase and an isozyme of glycogen synthase in S. cerevisiae, employed STRE to induce expression in response to stationary phase and heat shock (12Ni H.T. LaPorte D.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29Sunnarborg S.W. Miller S.P. Unnikrishnan I. LaPorte D.C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1505-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sequences that appear to match the consensus for STREs were also found in the promoter of GSY1, centered at –374 and –236. These elements were designated as STRE-1 and STRE-2, respectively (Fig. 3). Mutation of either or both STRE-1 or STRE-2 within the 1700 bp of upstream sequences resulted in a striking decrease in expression of GSY1 in both log and stationary phase (Fig. 3). Thus, these elements appear to be functional and are required for expression of GSY1. These elements may act synergistically, because the sum of the activities observed with either element alone was less than that observed when both were intact. The major STRE-specific binding factor in yeast is the product of the MSN2 gene. MSN4p, a close structural homologue of MSN2p, was also shown to be capable of binding the STRE sequence (30Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. Schuller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 31Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Mutation of msn2 and msn4 genes greatly reduced GSY1:lacZ activity (Fig. 3), consistent with the suggestion that they act on GSY1 through the STRE. STRE mediate induction of a number of genes in response to a variety of stressors in addition to stationary phase (32Marchler G. Schuller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). As a further test of the roles of STRE-1 and STRE-2, we examined the response of GSY1 to heat shock. Shifting a culture from 21 to 37 °C caused a 6-fold induction of GSY1 promoter activity within an hour following the shift (Fig. 4). Mutation of either element greatly reduced this response and the double mutant failed to respond at all. As with the effect of growth into stationary phase, STRE-1 and STRE-2 appeared to act synergistically. Rox1 Represses GSY1 Expression—During a deletion analysis of the GSY1 promoter, we found a region between –209 and –154 bp that appeared to include a negative element (data not shown). This deletion resulted in a striking increase in promoter activity in both log (19-fold) and stationary phase (7-fold) of growth. Examination of this region identified a sequence that matched the consensus binding site for Rox1 (Fig. 5), a repressor protein that is induced in response to oxygen (33Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the role of this element in GSY1 promoter function, we mutated this sequence (–210 to –199 bp) in the GSY1:lacZ reporter. Mutation of the ROX1 gene increased expression of a GSY1:lacZ fusion in both log phase and stationary cells (Fig. 5A), consistent with the suggestion that the Rox1 repressor controls GSY1. Similarly, mutation of the Rox1 binding site in a ROX1 background increased GSY1:lacZ expression. In contrast, mutation of this site had no effect in a rox1 strain. Mutation of the ROX1 gene had a greater effect on GSY1:lacZ expression than did mutation of the Rox1 binding site (Fig. 5A). This probably did not result from the presence of a second Rox1 site in the GSY1 promoter, because we could find no other sequence that matched the binding site consensus. The greater effect of the ROX1 gene mutation may have been a secondary consequence of a general effect on cellular metabolism, although that remains to be proven. The ROX1 gene is known to be transcriptionally activated by heme (34Lowry C.V. Zitomer R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4651-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). If GSY1 is, indeed, repressed by Rox1, then a heme deficiency would be expected to derepress GSY1 expression because of a reduction in Rox1. We tested this prediction by inserting the GSY1:lacZ fusion genes into isogenic strains that carried wild-type or deleted alleles of HEM1, a gene required for heme biosynthesis (35Keng T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2616-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Deletion of HEM1 did, indeed, derepress GSY1:lacZ, consistent with the prediction (Fig. 5B). The cis-mutation in the Rox1 element had a somewhat greater effect, perhaps because Rox1 was not completely eliminated by the HEM1 deletion. Mutation of both HEM1 and the Rox1 element were not additive. It thus appears that Rox1 represses GSY1 and may mediate an effect of heme. It might be noted that the wild-type strains in panels A and B of Fig. 5 exhibit quite different levels of β-galactosidase activities. This difference is most likely explained by the fact that these strains have different genetic backgrounds. Mig1 Also Represses GSY1 Expression—Examination of the GSY1 promoter sequence revealed a second possible repressor binding site at –250 bp. This sequence matches the consensus binding site of Mig1 (36Lundin M. Nehlin J O. Ronne H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1979-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 37Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2891-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), a protein that participates in glucose repression. Mutation of this site yielded a 3-fold increase in GSY1:lacZ expression (Fig. 6). A similar increase was observed when the MIG1 gene was mutated. These effects were not additive: mutation of the MIG1 gene and the Mig1 site had the same effect as either mutation alone. These results indicate that GSY1 is repressed by Mig1 when grown on glucose. The observation that Mig1 appears to repress GSY1 expression suggested that this gene should respond specifically to glucose as a carbon source. Consistent with this prediction, the levels of GSY1 fusion protein were extremely low on glucose (3 ± 0.3 β-galactosidase units) compared with growth on raffinose (122 ± 7), glycerol (117 ± 4), or lactate (125 ± 7) media. Identification of a Novel Repressor Element in the GSY1 Promoter—Experiments mapping the GSY1 promoter revealed a third negative element. Mutations between –322 and –316 bp yielded a 2-fold increase in GSY1:lacZ expression (Fig. 7). Deletion analysis indicated that the negative element lay, at least in part, between –328 to –314 bp and effects up to 5-fold were observed when the full element was deleted. We have narrowed the location of this negative element by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 7). Mutation or deletions outside of the region from –324 to –314 bp had no effect on expression, suggesting that the negative element lay within this region. A literature search revealed no published sequence in the yeast literature that resembles this region, suggesting that this element may be novel. We refer to this negative element as N1. To determine whether N1 was sufficient to repress expression from an STRE-linked promoter, we synthesized an N1 oligonucleotide that included the sequence from –324 to –314 bp. This oligonucleotide was inserted downstream of STRE-1 in the basal promoter (containing only the TATA element and no regulatory elements) of CYC1:lacZ. This"

Detailed studies of a dodecapeptide, FDTGAFDPDWPA, a molecular mimic of the polysaccharide antigen, and two new analogs, indicated a propensity for β-turn formation. Different β-turn types were found to be present in the trans and cis (Trp-10–Pro-11) isomers of the peptide: the trans isomer favored a type I β-turn from residues Asp-7–Trp-10, whereas the cis isomer exhibited a type VI β-turn from residues Asp-9–Ala-12. The interaction of the dodecapeptide FDTGAFDPDWPA with a protective anti-group B Streptococcus monoclonal antibody has also been investigated, by transferred nuclear Overhauser effect NMR spectroscopy and saturation-transfer difference NMR spectroscopy (STD-NMR). The peptide was found to adopt a type I β-turn conformation on binding to the antibody; the peptide residues (Asp-7–Trp-10) forming this turn are recognized by the antibody, as demonstrated by STD-NMR experiments.

The production of specific antibodies against polysaccharides plays a significant role in the defense against bacterial infection. The Gram-positive group B streptococci (GBS) 1The abbreviations used are: GBS, group B Streptococcus; DQF-COSY, double-quantum filtered COSY; DSS, 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GBS-PIII, group B streptococcal type III capsular polysaccharide antigen; mAb, monoclonal antibody; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; STD-NMR, saturation-transfer difference NMR spectroscopy; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; trNOESY, transferred nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; ROESY, rotating-frame Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; NANUC, Canadian National High-Field NMR Centre. are a major cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis (1Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Morbid. Mortal. Wk. Rep. 1996; 45: 1Google Scholar, 2Baker C.J. Edwards M.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 549: 193-202Google Scholar). These bacteria are encapsulated with type-specific polysaccharides (3Lancefield R.C. Freimer E.H. J. Hyg. 1966; 64: 191-203Google Scholar). The immunogenicity of these polysaccharides is unexpected because they all contain terminal sialic acid residues, which are not usually immunogenic because of their presence in human tissues (4Jennings H.J. Katzenellenbogen E. Lugowski C. Michon F. Roy R. Kasper D.L. Pure Appl. Chem. 1984; 56: 893-905Google Scholar). For example, the NeuAc-α-(2→3)-Gal glycosidic linkage is found in human blood group substances (4Jennings H.J. Katzenellenbogen E. Lugowski C. Michon F. Roy R. Kasper D.L. Pure Appl. Chem. 1984; 56: 893-905Google Scholar). Strikingly, all bacteria with polysaccharide capsules containing terminal sialic acid are human pathogens (4Jennings H.J. Katzenellenbogen E. Lugowski C. Michon F. Roy R. Kasper D.L. Pure Appl. Chem. 1984; 56: 893-905Google Scholar, 5Jennings H.J. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 155-206Google Scholar). The presence of sialic acid is important in pathogenesis in that it confers resistance to the immune system by inhibition of activation of the alternative pathway of complement (4Jennings H.J. Katzenellenbogen E. Lugowski C. Michon F. Roy R. Kasper D.L. Pure Appl. Chem. 1984; 56: 893-905Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that sialic acid may also have important effects on the conformational properties of polysaccharides. A study by Jennings and co-workers (6Zou W. Mackenzie R. Thérien L. Hirama T. Yang Q. Gidney M.A. Jennings H.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 820-825Google Scholar) showed an unusual length dependence of the binding affinity of oligosaccharide portions of the GBS type III capsular polysaccharide (GBSPIII; see Scheme 1) to antibodies. At least two repeating units were required for even suboptimal binding, and binding affinity increased with chain length. Furthermore, the terminal sialic acid residues were shown not to be immunodominant, yet were essential for the formation of GBSPIII-specific antibodies. In addition, NMR studies indicated that GBSPIII was capable of forming extended helices in solution (7Brisson J.-R. Uhrinova S. Woods R.J. van der Zwan M. Jarrell H.C. Paoletti L.C. Kasper D.L. Jennings H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3278-3292Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of a conformational epitope, that is, a certain conformation or secondary structure present within an ensemble of conformations adopted by the polysaccharide and being the only one recognized by antibodies, was hypothesized (6Zou W. Mackenzie R. Thérien L. Hirama T. Yang Q. Gidney M.A. Jennings H.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 820-825Google Scholar, 7Brisson J.-R. Uhrinova S. Woods R.J. van der Zwan M. Jarrell H.C. Paoletti L.C. Kasper D.L. Jennings H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3278-3292Google Scholar). Antibodies directed against such an epitope, only formed by extended segments of polysaccharide, would avoid binding to the short oligosaccharides found in human tissue antigens and allow defense against invading bacteria without harmful effects to the human body. Evidence for such length-dependent conformational epitopes has also been reported for the group B Neisseria meningitidis (8Jennings H.J. Roy R. Michon F. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 2651-2657Google Scholar) and Streptococcus pneumoniae type 14 (9Wessels M.R. Kasper D.L. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 2121-2131Google Scholar) polysaccharides, and the x-ray crystal structure of an antibody directed against the N. meningitidis polysaccharide showed an unusually long, groove-shaped binding site, also suggesting that the antibody recognized a long, helical structure (10Evans S.V. Sigurskjold B.W. Jennings H.J. Brisson J.-R. To R. Tse W.C. Altman E. Frosch M. Weisgerber C. Kratzin H.D. Klebert S. Vaesen M. Bitter-Suermann D. Rose D.R. Young N.M. Bundle D.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6737-6744Google Scholar). The evidence showing that sialic acid is essential for formation of the epitope, yet is not itself involved in the epitope, raises the question of exactly how the polysaccharide-antibody recognition occurs. Vaccines based on GBSPIII or GBSPIII-protein conjugates are expected to be successful (11Berner R. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2002; 15: 307-313Google Scholar, 12Schuchat A. Lancet. 1999; 353: 51-56Google Scholar). More extensive knowledge of the modes of interaction of GBSPIII oligosaccharides with antibodies would be helpful in the design of targeted vaccines. Furthermore, the use of carbohydrate-mimetic peptides (13Johnson M.A. Pinto B.M. Aust. J. Chem. 2002; 55: 13-25Google Scholar) may be valuable in this system. Carbohydrate-mimetic peptides are a promising strategy to improve the immunological characteristics of polysaccharides. Thus, although some polysaccharides have been developed into effective vaccines, some undesirable characteristics remain; T-independent responses lacking memory and lack of response in infants are examples. In many cases, conjugation of the polysaccharide to a protein carrier overcomes these problems. However, in certain cases, when it may be desirable to select and amplify only one component of the immune response, the combination of peptides with polysaccharides may be very useful. The feasibility of an alternative approach to GBS vaccination, based on carbohydrate-mimetic peptides, has been demonstrated (14Pincus S.H. Smith M.J. Jennings H.J. Burritt J.B. Glee P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 293-298Google Scholar). Thus, a protective monoclonal antibody against GBS, directed against GBSPIII, was developed (mAb S9; Refs. 14Pincus S.H. Smith M.J. Jennings H.J. Burritt J.B. Glee P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 293-298Google Scholar and 15Pincus S.H. Shigeoka A.O. Moe A.A. Ewing L.P. Hill H.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2779-2785Google Scholar). Peptides acting as specific ligands for mAb S9 were isolated by screening a phage-displayed peptide library with this mAb. A high affinity (IC50 = 23 μm) peptide ligand, FDTGAFDPDWPAC, competitively inhibited binding of GBS not only to mAb S9 but also to polyclonal anti-GBS antibodies. Immunization of mice with peptide-protein conjugates produced an anti-GBS and anti-GBSPIII immune response (14Pincus S.H. Smith M.J. Jennings H.J. Burritt J.B. Glee P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 293-298Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the molecular basis of GBSPIII mimicry and to design better immunogens, we have undertaken detailed conformational studies of the immunogenic peptide FDTGAFDPDWPA and two of its analogs in solution, using NMR spectroscopy. In addition, we have investigated the interactions of the parent peptide and of oligosaccharides corresponding to the type-specific polysaccharide with mAb S9. We report herein the conformational preferences of the three peptides in solution and of one in complex with the antibody. We show that the biologically active peptide mimics exhibit the propensity to form type I β-turn structures that are highly dynamic in the free peptide systems. Further, we identify important determinants of oligosaccharide recognition by the antibody. This study serves as a prelude to the detailed comparison of the topographies of a carbohydrate and of its peptide mimetic in recognition by antibodies. Peptides—The dodecapeptide FDTGAFDPDWPA (peptide 1) was purchased from Cell Essentials (Boston, MA). The peptides FDTGAFDPDWPYD (peptide 1A) and FDTGAFDPDWPY (peptide 1B) were purchased from LSU Health Sciences Center Core Laboratories (New Orleans, LA). All three peptides were N-acylated and C-amidated at their respective termini. Competitive Inhibition Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—The ability of synthetic peptides to inhibit the binding of mAb S9 to intact GBS was measured by ELISA, as described previously (14Pincus S.H. Smith M.J. Jennings H.J. Burritt J.B. Glee P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 293-298Google Scholar). MAb S9 is a murine IgM directed against GBSPIII (14Pincus S.H. Smith M.J. Jennings H.J. Burritt J.B. Glee P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 293-298Google Scholar) and is highly protective against infection by type III GBS in an animal model. Purified S9 was obtained by distilled water dialysis of ascites fluid. Antibody was titrated for binding to GBS, and two dilutions on the midpoint of the binding curve were selected, 0.5 and 0.2 μg/ml. Peptide concentrations were determined carefully using the BCA protein determination kit (Pierce). Serial dilutions of peptides were mixed with mAb S9 diluted in PBS and 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Microtiter plates (Immulon 2HB, Dynatech, Chantilly, VA) were coated with intact GBS by first coating the wells with poly-l-lysine, then adding the GBS, and cross-linking the GBS with glutaraldehyde, as described previously (14Pincus S.H. Smith M.J. Jennings H.J. Burritt J.B. Glee P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 293-298Google Scholar, 15Pincus S.H. Shigeoka A.O. Moe A.A. Ewing L.P. Hill H.R. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2779-2785Google Scholar). Plates were blocked with PBS and bovine serum albumin at 4 °C for 18 h. The antibody-peptide mixture (100 μl) was plated into the microtiter wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plates were washed with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 six times; alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (heavy plus light chain-specific, Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was added. After a 6-h incubation at room temperature, the secondary antibody was washed off, and the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) was added (0.5 mg/ml in diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8). The absorbance at 405 nm was monitored at various time points thereafter. The data presented are the means of multiple determinations, with error bars indicating the S.E. When no error bars are present, the S.E. was smaller than the symbol used in the figure. NMR Spectroscopy of Free Peptides—1H NMR spectra were recorded at Montana State University on Bruker DRX 500- and 600-MHz spectrometers using sample tubes with a 5-mm outer diameter. The spectra of the three peptides at 2 mm sample concentration were recorded at 280Kin20mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 4.2 and pH 4.8, prepared in 90% H2O and 10% D2O. Spectra were also recorded for samples prepared at 2 mm concentration in water:trifluoroethanol, 7:3. Identical NOE patterns were observed in these spectra, indicating that trifluoroethanol did not alter the conformational preferences of the peptides. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using the States-TPPI method (16States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Res. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) or TPPI method (17Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Google Scholar) for quadrature detection in the t1 dimension. All experiments were carried out using the WATERGATE pulse sequence for water suppression (18Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-666Google Scholar). Two-dimensional 1H,1H NOESY spectra were recorded with mixing times of 220 and 280 ms. Two-dimensional 1H,1H TOCSY spectra were recorded using an MLEV-17 spin-lock sequence with a 10-kHz rf field strength and a mixing time of 60 ms. For two-dimensional 1H,1H ROESY, mixing pulses of 220- and 280-ms duration were applied at a 3-kHz rf field strength. Typically, spectra were acquired with 448–512 t1 increments (except 1024 t1 increments for DQF-COSY), 2048 data points, and a relaxation delay of 1.5 s, spanning a spectral width of 11.0 ppm. Spectra were acquired with 96 scans/t1 increment for NOESY, 96 scans/t1 increment for ROESY, 16 scans/t1 increment for TOCSY, and 40 scans/t1 increment for DQF-COSY. Spectra were processed using XWIN-NMR, Version 2.6 (Bruker). All spectra were zero-filled once in both spectral dimensions, and a sine-bell window function, phase-shifted by 45–90°, was applied in both dimensions prior to Fourier transformation. NMR Spectroscopy of Ligand-Antibody Interactions—NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX 600-(Simon Fraser University) and on a Varian 800-MHz NMR spectrometer (NANUC, Edmonton, Alberta). Chemical shifts were referred to DSS (internal standard). MAb S9 was prepared by Ligocyte, Inc. (Bozeman, MT) by growth in serum-free hybridoma growth medium and precipitation with an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was washed with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate, resuspended in PBS, and dialyzed against several changes of PBS to remove the remaining ammonium sulfate. For preparation of NMR samples, antibody solutions were concentrated using a stirred cell ultrafiltration unit (Amicon, model 8010) with a regenerated cellulose membrane (nominal molecular weight cutoff 10,000). A molecular mass of 975,000 Da for the IgM antibody was assumed. The NMR sample of peptide 1 in the presence of mAb S9 contained 8.5 μm antibody (8.3 mg/ml) and 2.1 mm peptide, for a ratio of 25:1 peptide:antibody binding sites, in PBS solution (10 mm (KH2PO4/K2HPO4), 150 mm NaCl), pH 6.4, containing 0.02% NaN3, 10% D2O, and 40 μm DSS. For the preparation of an NMR sample of the decasaccharides in the presence of the antibody, mAb S9 was exchanged into D2O buffer (10 mm (KH2PO4/K2HPO4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, prepared in 99.9% D2O) as follows. MAb S9 (6.2 mg, 4.6 mg/ml in PBS, pH 6.5) was concentrated from 1.35 ml to 0.5 ml, then diluted to 15 ml with D2O buffer, and concentrated to 0.6 ml by ultrafiltration as described above. Two more exchanges were performed (15 ml → 0.7 ml, 5 ml → 0.5 ml), for a total of three exchanges; the sample was then filtered through a 0.2 μm membrane. To the concentrated, filtered antibody solution was added 0.9 mg of decasaccharide 1, and precipitation was observed (precipitin reaction). The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was filtered into the NMR tube. The antibody concentration remaining in the supernatant was estimated by A280 (ϵ = 1.2) to be 0.95 μm; at a nominal 1 concentration of 0.75 mm, this would mean a ligand:binding site ratio of 79:1; however, the actual ratio may be somewhat less. The final sample contained 40 μm DSS. 1 mg of the N-propionylated decasaccharide 2 was later added to the sample for a nominal concentration of 0.82 mm; very little precipitation was observed at this time.

The one-dimensional STD-NMR spectra of mAb S9/decasaccharides were recorded at 800 MHz and 298 K with 8192 scans, selective saturation of protein resonances at 10 ppm, and a total saturation time of 2.04 s. Subtraction of saturated spectra from reference spectra was performed by phase cycling (19Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Google Scholar, 20Klein J. Meinecke R. Mayer M.

The observed trNOE correlations were large and negative; a sample of the peptide in the presence of a different antibody showed only minimal NOE intensities at 800 MHz. Structure calculations were based on a spectrum recorded with 64 scans/increment and a mixing time of 200 ms. Data processing was performed by zero filling to 2048 points in F1 to give a final data matrix of 4096 × 2048 followed by multiplication with a squared cosine function and Fourier transformation. Automatic base-line correction was performed prior to integration of cross-peak volumes. Cross-peak intensities were converted to distances by first correcting for peak multiplicity by dividing the intensity by the factor (ni*nj), where ni and nj are the numbers of protons contributing to the cross-peak in F2 and F1 (29Yip P.F. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 382-383Google Scholar). Corrected intensities were then converted to distances using the relationship Iij/Iref = ((rref/rij)6) (30Baleja J.D. Moult J. Sykes B.D. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 375-384Google Scholar) using the distance between the Pro-11 Hδ protons (1.8 Å) as a reference. The calculated distances were incorporated into a simulated annealing protocol within the program XPLOR (31Brünger A.T. XPLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). Only unambiguously assigned cross-peaks were included, leading to a set of 47 distance restraints (33 inter-residue; Table S1). Distance restraints consisted of a minimum distance of 1.8 Å and a maximum distance of (rij + 0.75 Å). Distances involving unresolved or unassigned diastereotopic protons were treated using center averaging (31Brünger A.T. XPLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). A structure of the peptide in an extended conformation was used as a starting point for molecular dynamics calculations. Simulations consisted of 30 ps of molecular dynamics at 1000 K, using the parallhdg force field, with increasing force constants for geometry and a force constant for NOE-derived distances of 50 kcal/mol/Å2, followed by cooling to 100 K for 20 ps. 40 structures produced by this method were refined by another cooling cycle from 1000 to 100 K over 45 ps, followed by 200 cycles of energy minimization. During the calculations, nonglycine residues were restrained to negative ϕ values. The criteria for acceptance of structures were correct geometry and no distance restraint violations of > 0.5 Å; 34 of 40 structures satisfied these criteria. Analysis of the structures was performed within Insight II 2000 (Accelrys, Inc.). NMR Resonance Assignments—1H chemical shifts and resonance assignments were established using two-dimensional 1H,1H TOCSY, NOESY, and ROESY experiments (32Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Google Scholar) and are reported in Table I. Sequential assignments of 1H resonances were based on characteristic sequential NOE connectivities observed between the α-proton of residue i and the amide proton of residue i+1, i.e. dαN(i,i+1), in both NOESY and ROESY data sets. Three-bond 3JHN,Hα coupling constants were extracted from either one-dimensional 1H spectra or two-dimensional DQF-COSY spectra. Coupling constants and temperature coefficients describing the changes in amide proton chemical shifts as a function of temperature are reported in Table II. A summary of sequential (d(i,i+1)) and short range (d(i,i+2)) and (d(i,i+3)) 1H-1H NOE connectivities is presented in Fig. 1.Table I1H chemical shifts of the dodecapeptide FDTGAFDPDWPA (peptide 1) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 4.2, and 280 KHNHαHβOthersppmppmppmppmTrans isomerPhe-18.384.553.11 and 2.97H2,6 = 7.18; H3,5 = 7.31Asp-28.584.662.76 and 2.63Thr-38.214.274.3Hγ = 1.22Gly-48.513.91Ala-58.034.231.27Phe-68.274.513.03H2,6 = 7.23; H3,5 = 7.32Asp-78.134.822.69 and 2.46Pro-84.232.21 and 1.84Hγ = 1.96; Hδ = 3.74 and 3.58Asp-98.284.582.71 and 2.63Trp-107.874.923.30 and 3.13Trp side chain: 2H = 7.21; 4H = 7.68; 5H = 7.17; 6H = 7.23; 7H = 7.47; indole NH = 10.16Pro-114.342.22 and 1.86Hγ = 1.87; Hδ = 3.64 and 3.29Ala-128.244.221.36Cis isomerPhe-18.384.553.11 and 2.97H2,6 = 7.18; H3,5 = 7.31Asp-28.584.662.76 and 2.63Thr-38.214.274.3Hγ = 1.22Gly-48.483.89Ala-58.014.191.24Phe-68.274.513.03H2,6 = 7.23; H3,5 = 7.32Asp-78.324.892.91 and 2.60Pro-84.362.31 and 1.97Hγ = 2.00; Hδ = 3.81 and 3.59Asp-98.334.72.85 and 2.70Trp-107.824.573.23Pro-113.380.94 and 1.60Hγ = 1.47 and 1.37; Hδ = 3.36 and 3.12Ala-128.254.181.36 Open table in a new tab Table IITemperature coefficients (Δδ/ΔT, ppb/K) for backbone amide protons and three-bond, amide proton to Hαcoupling constants (3JHN,Hα), for the trans and cis isomers of peptide 1 and for the trans isomer of peptide 1A (major species, 1Ai)Peptide 1 (FDTGAFDPDWPA)Peptide 1A (FDTGAFDPDWPYD)Temperature coefficient3JHN,HαTemperature coefficient3JHN,Hαppb/KHzppb/KHzPhe-1-106.6-96.1Asp-2-66.5-77.1Thr-3-6 (-6)aValues in parentheses are for the cis isomer.8.0 (8.0)-76.8Gly-4-6 (-5)7.8 (ND)bND, not determined (due to overlap of resonances).-69.2Ala-5-6 (-7)5.9 (5.8)-6NDbND, not determined (due to overlap of resonances).Phe-6-96.0 (6.0)-97.0Asp-7-7 (-7)6.5 (7.3)-87.1Pro-8Asp-9-4 (-3)7.6 (7.8)-4NDbND, not determined (due to overlap of resonances).Trp-10-2 (-2)6.1 (5.8)-57.0Pro-11Ala-12-12 (-8)5.8 (5.8)Tyr-12: -106.6Asp-13: -47.3a Values in parentheses are for the cis isomer.b ND, not determined (due to overlap of resonances). Open table in a new tab Conformation of FDTGAFDPDWPA (Peptide 1)—The NMR spectra of the dodecapeptide FDTGAFDPDWPA revealed that the peptide exists in two isoforms due to cis-trans isomerization about the Trp-10–Pro-11 amide bond (Figs. 2 and 3). The trans isoform was identified by the presence of characteristic Trp-10 Hα to Pro-11 Hδ NOE cross-peaks. In addition, an NOE between Trp-10 Hα and Pro-11 Hα, characteristic of cis-proline, was apparent and confirmed the presence of a cis/trans isomer mixture (Fig. 3B). NMR signals originating from both isomers are identified in the NOESY and TOCSY spectra shown in Figs. 2 and 3A, respectively. The ratio of trans to cis isomer was estimated to be 7:3, based on the differential signal intensity of the resolved indole NH resonance of each isomer in the one-dimensional 1H spectrum. No cis-trans isomerization was detected across the Asp-7–Pro-8 amide bond, but this does not exclude the possibility that a small amount of the peptide, too small to be detected by NMR, exhibits the cis configuration.Fig. 3Section of the two-dimensional 1H,1H TOCSY spectrum of peptide 1, recorded in phosphate buffer at 280 K with a mixing time of 60 ms.A, the proton side chain resonances of Pro-8, Pro-11, and Trp-10, for both cis and trans isomers of peptide 1.

B, the dαα(i, i+1) NOE connectivity between the α-protons of Trp-10 and Pro-11, characteristic of the cis isomer, and the dαδ(i, i+1) NOE connectivity between the α-proton of Trp-10 and the δ-protons of Pro-11, characteristic of the trans isomer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The NOE connectivities for peptide 1 in aqueous solution at 280 K are summarized in Fig. 1A. Interestingly, a continuous stretch of dNN(i,i+1) and dαN(i,i+2) NOEs was observed from residues Phe-1 to Asp-7, indicative of turn-like structures often referred to as “nascent helices” (33Dyson H.J. Rance M. Houghten R.A. Lerner R.A. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 161-200Google Scholar) and typically dynamic and transient in nature. Consistent with this observation, small but significant upfield shifts of the Hα resonances (∼ 0.1–0.2-ppm deviations from random coil values) were observed for Phe-1, Asp-2, Thr-3, Ala-5, Phe-6, Pro-8, and Asp-9 in the trans isomer. With the exception of the Hα of Asp-9, a similar chemical shift trend was observed for the cis isomer (Table I). For the trans isomer, a type I β-turn was detected from residues Asp-7 through Trp-10. Supporting the presence of a type I β-turn, weak dαN NOEs were observed, between Asp-7 and Trp-10, and between Pro-8 and Trp-10 (Fig. 3). Observation of a weak dδN NOE between Pro-8 and Asp-9, as well as a strong dNN NOE between Asp-9 and Trp-10, also confirmed the presence of a type I β-turn. These data were corroborated by the small temperature coefficient (i.e. change in chemical shift as a function of temperature, Δδ/ΔT) of –2 ppb/K measured for the backbone amide proton of Trp-10, which indicated that the Trp-10 amide hydrogen participates in a hydrogen bond (Table II). For the cis isomer, analogous NOE patterns were observed for residues Asp-7 to Trp-10, except that the dαN NOE between residues Asp-7 and Trp-10 present in the trans isomer was not present in the cis-isomer species (Fig. 1B). This suggests that the type I β-turn observed in a large portion of the trans conformers is not represented in the population of structures of the cis species in solution. Rather, the cis isomer may populate interconverting conformations, possibly involving type VI β-turns spanning residues Asp-9–Ala-12, as suggested by the observation of a dαN NOE between Trp-10 and Ala-12 (Fig. 1B). Type VI β-turns have often been observed in peptides containing cis-proline residues, especially when the cis-Pro is preceded by an aromatic residue, and are typically characterized by upfield shifted Hα and Hβ proton chemic"
https://openalex.org/W2159449353,"Previously we reported that ferritin in corneal epithelial (CE) cells is a nuclear protein that protects DNA from UV damage. Since ferritin is normally cytoplasmic, in CE cells, a mechanism must exist that effects its nuclear localization. We have now determined that this involves a nuclear transport molecule we have termed ferritoid. Ferritoid is specific for CE cells and is developmentally regulated. Structurally, ferritoid contains multiple domains, including a functional SV40-type nuclear localization signal and a ferritin-like region of ∼50% similarity to ferritin itself. This latter domain is likely responsible for the interaction between ferritoid and ferritin detected by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. To test functionally whether ferritoid is capable of transporting ferritin into the nucleus, we performed cotransfections of COS-1 cells with constructs for ferritoid and ferritin. Consistent with the proposed nuclear transport function for ferritoid, co-transfections with full-length constructs for ferritoid and ferritin resulted in a preferential nuclear localization of both molecules; this was not observed when the nuclear localization signal of ferritoid was deleted. Moreover, since ferritoid is structurally similar to ferritin, it may be an example of a nuclear transporter that evolved from the molecule it transports (ferritin).

Moreover, since ferritoid is structurally similar to ferritin, it may be an example of a nuclear transporter that evolved from the molecule it transports (ferritin). UV light constitutes a major environmental insult to all exposed tissues of the body, damaging a wide variety of macromolecular components ranging from DNA to proteins and lipids (1Gutteridge J.M. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: S16-S21Google Scholar, 2Sidjanin D. Zigman S. Reddan J. Curr. Eye Res. 1993; 12: 773-781Google Scholar). This damage can be direct, or it can be indirect through the generation of reactive oxygen species. The resulting damage to DNA is thought to be a major factor in epidermal cancers (3Hart R.W. Setlow R.B. Woodhead A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5574-5578Google Scholar). However, corneal epithelial (CE) 1The abbreviations used are: CE, corneal epithelial; NLS, nuclear localization signal; FTD, ferritoid; FTD-FL, full-length FTD; FTN, ferritin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IP, immunoprecipitate; WB, Western blot; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. 1The abbreviations used are: CE, corneal epithelial; NLS, nuclear localization signal; FTD, ferritoid; FTD-FL, full-length FTD; FTN, ferritin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IP, immunoprecipitate; WB, Western blot; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. cells seem to be refractory to such damage. Although these cells are constantly exposed to UV light and to other reactive oxygen species-generating sources such as molecular O2, primary cancers of these cells are rare (4Smolinand G. Thoft R.A. The Cornea: Scientific Foundations and Clinical Practice. Little, Brown and Company, Boston1987: 499-508Google Scholar). This suggests that CE cells have defense mechanisms that prevent damage to their DNA. Our previous studies (5Cai C.X. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1037-1051Google Scholar) suggest that one of these mechanisms involves ferritin, a molecule known to decrease the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species by sequestering iron (6Balla G. Jacob H.S. Balla J. Rosenberg M. Nath K. Apple F. Eaton J.W. Vercellotti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18148-18153Google Scholar). This sequestration minimizes the Fenton reaction-mediated conversion of hydrogen peroxide to hydroxy radicals that are capable of damaging DNA (7Mello Filho A.C. Hoffmann M.E. Meneghini R. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 273-275Google Scholar, 8Mello-Filho A.C. Meneghini R. Mutat. Res. 1991; 251: 109-113Google Scholar) and other cellular components (9Kasetsuwan N. Wu F.M. Hsieh F. Sanchez D. McDonnell P.J. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1999; 117: 649-652Google Scholar), with the damage to DNA generating at least 50 degradation products (10Henle E.S. Luo Y. Gassmann W. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21177-21186Google Scholar, 11Luo Y. Henle E.S. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21167-21176Google Scholar). In most cell types, ferritin is cytoplasmic. However, we (12Cai C.X. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12831-12839Google Scholar) have observed that in avian CE cells, but in no other cell type examined, ferritin is predominantly, if not exclusively, nuclear. In this location, it seems to be especially effective in diminishing damage by UV irradiation to DNA (5Cai C.X. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1037-1051Google Scholar). Ferritin is a multimeric protein comprised of 24 subunits that undergo supramolecular assembly to form the complex (13Lavoie D.J. Ishikawa K. Listowsky I. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5448-5454Google Scholar). In mammals, this complex contains both H- and L-chain subunits (14Theil E.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 289-315Google Scholar). However, in chicken, the H-chain (which we will refer to as the ferritin monomer or subunit) is the only one that we and others (15Broxmeyer H.E. Cooper S. Levi S. Arosio P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 770-774Google Scholar, 16Passaniti A. Roth T.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 413-419Google Scholar) have detected, suggesting that chicken ferritin is homopolymeric. The monomer is comprised of five α-helical regions (A–E) (17Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Google Scholar) that are involved in the supramolecular assembly of the complex and contribute to its functional characteristics, such as the ability to sequester iron (18Levi S. Luzzago A. Cesareni G. Cozzi A. Franceschinelli F. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18086-18092Google Scholar, 19Levi S. Luzzago A. Franceschinelli F. Santambrogio P. Cesareni G. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 381-388Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined how this normally cytoplasmic molecule undergoes nuclear transport in a tissue-specific manner. Proteins pass into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex with most small ones entering by free diffusion (20Peters R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 305-359Google Scholar) and large ones employing a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-dependent mechanism. The best characterized NLS is the “basic type” (21Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Google Scholar), which consists of one or two clusters of basic amino acids. However, other NLSs also exist, such as the M9 signal (22Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Siomi H. Michael W.M. Pollard V. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 229: 261-266Google Scholar, 23Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Google Scholar). Ferritin, however, contains neither of these NLS, nor, if present, would they provide the tissue specificity required to restrict transport to CE cells. Also, our recent transfection analyses with deletion constructs for ferritin (24Cai C.X. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2327-2334Google Scholar) failed to detect any discrete region that might function as a non-consensus NLS. Instead, the results suggested that, for nuclear transport to occur, most (>85%) of the monomer must be present. That much of the molecular structure of ferritin is required for nuclear transport suggests that some aspect(s) of molecular conformation is involved, possibly through binding and/or recognition by another cellular component, such as a tissue-specific nuclear transporter. In the present study, we present evidence for the involvement of such a molecule (which we have termed ferritoid) that: 1) is expressed only in CE cells, 2) has one domain with a functional SV40-type NLS and another (likely to be involved in binding to ferritin) that is structurally similar to ferritin, and 3) can facilitate the transport of ferritin into the nucleus. White Leghorn eggs were obtained from Charles River/SPAFAS (North Franklin, CT). Chemicals were purchased from Fisher Biochemicals unless otherwise noted. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by IDT (Coralville, IA), and sequencing was performed by the Tufts University Core Facility. Subtractive Hybridization and Library Screening—To isolate cDNA clones for genes up-regulated in cornea, subtractive hybridization (25Nurminskaya M. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 206: 260-271Google Scholar, 26Wang Z. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11505-11509Google Scholar) was performed using cDNA from 12-day cornea versus sclera and eyelid. Clones were screened by colony PCR, sequenced, and analyzed by BLAST (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) search of GenBank™. One clone, 12C1-A2, which had a ferritin-like amino acid composition, was used to screen a CE cDNA library (12Cai C.X. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12831-12839Google Scholar), and positive colonies were sequenced. One (6–309) was characterized as being full-length for the coding region (see “Results”). Sequence Analysis—BLAST (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) sequence homology analysis of clone 6–309 was performed using the GenBank™ non-redundant protein and nucleotide databases. The theoretical open reading frame was determined with the Map program of the GCG Wisconsin software package, version 10.1 (Genetics Computer Group). PredictProtein (28Rost B.

Comparisons of three-dimensional structures were made using the Cn3D 3.0 program, with the crystal structure of human ferritin-H (Protein Data Bank code, 2FHA (31Hempstead P.D. Yewdall S.J.

Northern Blot Analysis—Tissues were dissected from chick embryos, rinsed in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated PBS, and stored at –20 °C in RNALater (Ambion). Total RNA was isolated using the RNEasy Maxi kit (Qiagen). 10 μg of RNA from each tissue was electrophoresed for 3 h through a 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel; RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and immobilized by UV cross-linking. Ferritoid clone 6–309 was labeled with [32P]dCTP (ICN) using the High Prime DNA labeling system (Roche Diagnostics), and hybridization was carried out according to Ausubel et al. (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley and Sons, 1993: 10.2A.28Google Scholar). The integrity of the RNA used in the Northern blot was assessed by visualizing the 28 S ribosomal RNA with ethidium bromide. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization was performed (33Rubin B.S. Lee C.E. Ohtomo M. King J.C. Brain Res. 1997; 770: 267-276Google Scholar) on frozen tissue sections (14 μm) of O.C.T. embedded anterior eyes (including cornea, sclera, and retina from 14-day embryos). The sections were thawed and fixed in 3.2% paraformaldehyde/PBS followed by dehydration and permeabilization in ethanol. Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were made from clone 12C1-A2 and others (see below) using a Genius 3 RNA labeling kit (Roche Biochemicals). Tissue was hybridized for 16 h at 52.5 °C in 50% deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 4× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution (Sigma), 1 mg/ml Escherichia coli tRNA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol with the labeled antisense 12C1-A2 RNA probe (100–200 μg/ml). Also used were the sense probe (a negative control), and as a positive control, a probe for type I collagen, which was a 330-nucleotide fragment corresponding to positions 45–374 of the chicken pro α-2 chain of type I collagen (GenBank™ accession number X02657). Following hybridization, the sections were treated with RNase A (8.25 μg/ml) and were washed sequentially in 2× SSC, 1× SSC, and 0.5× SSC (15 min each at room temperature) followed by 0.1× SSC (55 °C for 30 min). Then the sections were blocked in 0.05% Triton X-100, 2% sheep serum (Sigma), 2× SSC (2 h), washed twice in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl (5 min each), and incubated overnight in a 1:1000 dilution of a mouse anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Roche Biochemicals). Tissue was equilibrated in GB3 (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml levamisole (Sigma)) and incubated in the chromagen (GB3 plus nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Roche Biochemicals)) at room temperature in the dark until adequate color had developed. The reaction was stopped with 1× TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) (15 min). Cell Culture, Plasmid Construction, and Transfection—COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Primary cultures of chicken CE cells were initiated as described previously (12Cai C.X. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12831-12839Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F12 (1:1) (Invitrogen) plus 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 5 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin. For transfections, confluent COS-1 cells were passaged from one 10mm plate into four- or eight-chamber culture slides (BD Biosciences); the CE cells were plated onto 100-mm dishes. An expression construct for full-length ferritoid (FTD-FL) was generated by PCR from clone 6–309 using oligonucleotide primers Fdf10 (5′-ACGAGCATGGCCGAGCCGCGC-3′) and Fdr10 (5′-AAGTACCTCCCTCCCCTGTT-3′). A ferritoid construct from which the putative NLS was deleted (FTDNLS–) was similarly generated using primers Fdf11 (5′-ACGAGCATGGCCGACGTCACGCTG-3′) and Fdr10. PCR products were ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3.1 TOPO V5-His (Invitrogen). The inserts were confirmed by sequencing, and plasmid preparations were made using the Endo-free Plasmid Maxi Prep kit (Qiagen). COS-1 cells were transfected (using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen)) with the ferritoid constructs, either singly or in co-transfections with a c-Myc-tagged construct for full-length chicken ferritin-H (construct HM) (12Cai C.X. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12831-12839Google Scholar). For single transfections in four-chamber slides, 1.0 μg of plasmid was transfected per chamber; for co-transfections, 1.0 μg of the ferritoid plasmid plus 0.5 μg of the ferritin plasmid were used. For transfections in eight-chamber slides, the quantities of DNA were halved. 20–24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence. Primary cultures of CE cells were transfected with 8 μg of each plasmid using FuGENE 6 (Roche Biochemicals), and 48 h later, these cultures were harvested for immunoprecipitation. Immunofluorescence Analyses—Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (5Cai C.X. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1037-1051Google Scholar). The transfected cells were washed twice with cold PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (10 min at 4 °C), washed again in PBS, and permeabilized with 100% methanol (10 min at –20 °C). Cells were washed again with PBS, and free aldehydes were quenched (50 mm lysine, 50 mm glycine in PBS; 10 min) followed by blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (10 min). Cells were then incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed in PBS, and incubated in secondary antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature. For double labeling, isotype-specific secondary antibodies were used. Cells were then washed (3 × 5 min) in PBS and mounted in 95% glycerol/PBS containing 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). The cells were visualized using epifluorescence on a Nikon Fluophot microscope and photographed with a SPOT room temperature real-time CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). The primary monoclonal antibodies used were: 6D11 against chick ferritin (34Zak N.B. Linsenmayer T.F. Dev. Biol. 1983; 99: 373-381Google Scholar), 9E10 against the c-Myc epitope tag (35Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Google Scholar) located at the carboxyl terminus of the ferritin construct, and anti-V5 (Invitrogen) against the V5 epitope tag of the ferritoid construct. The secondary antibody used for single labeling immunolabeling was rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce); for double immunolabeling, the antibodies used were goat anti-mouse IgG1 (TRITC-labeled) for ferritin and goat anti-mouse IgG2a (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled) for ferritoid (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Transfected CE cells (100-mm dishes) were lysed for 10 min in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) containing EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Biochemicals) followed by scraping and gentle pipetting. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min at 14,400 RPM), and the supernatant was stored at –80 °C. To prevent non-specific binding, lysates were incubated with 1.0 μg of mouse IgG and 20 μl of Protein G plus/Protein A-Agarose (Oncogene) (30 min, 4 °C) with gentle rocking followed by centrifugation (2500 rpm, 5 min). The supernatant was incubated with primary antibody (100 μl of hybridoma supernatant for 6D11 and AC9 (anti-chick collagen X) monoclonal antibodies and 4 μlof anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen)) (1 h, 4 °C with rocking). Then 20 μl of Protein G plus/Protein A-Agarose was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation (2500 RPM for 5 min at 4 °C), washed four times in PBS, and resuspended in 40 μl of 2× electrophoresis sample buffer (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. J. Wiley and Sons, 1993: 10.2A.28Google Scholar). Samples were heated (95 °C, 5 min), spun briefly, and electrophoresed (15% SDS-PAGE). Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Western blots were performed using the following protocol: after brief treatment with 100% methanol, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were treated with blocking solution (10% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)) for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. Primary antibody was diluted in blocking solution (1:5000 for anti-V5, 1:2 for 9E10 and AC9) and incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature with shaking. Membranes were then washed (5 × 10 min) with TTBS (TBS plus 0.5% Tween 20) to remove unbound antibody. Secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce)) was diluted 1:20,000 in blocking solution and placed onto membranes for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed again in TTBS as above and incubated in chemiluminescence substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 2 min prior to exposure to photographic film. Isolation of a Ferritoid cDNA and Tissue Specificity—Ferritoid was initially identified as an up-regulated, 300-bp clone in a subtracted 12-day embryonic chicken corneal cDNA library. In analysis of the up-regulated clones by DNA sequencing and computer BLAST searches (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar), one clone (12C1-A2) contained an insert that, at the amino acid level, showed similarity to ferritin. Since ferritin monomers themselves undergo association during self-assembly of the ferritin complex (36Gerl M. Jaenicke R. Smith J.M. Harrison P.M. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4089-4096Google Scholar, 37Santambrogio P. Pinto P. Levi S. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Albertini A. Artymiuk P. Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 461-468Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that this clone might represent the ferritin-binding region of a nuclear transporter for ferritin in CE cells, as hypothesized in our previous studies (24Cai C.X. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2327-2334Google Scholar). If so, the encoded molecule should be specific for the CE or at least highly selective for this tissue. This was examined and confirmed by in situ hybridization and by Northern blotting. In situ hybridization of sections of entire anterior eyes (14-day embryos) localized ferritoid to the CE (Fig. 1A). (The dark linear structure present in all panels of Fig. 1 is not an in situ signal but the pigment of the pigmented epithelium (PE) of the iris (i) and ciliary body (cb) indicated in Fig. 1B.) The in situ signal for ferritoid ended at the corneal-scleral junction (designated by the asterisks) and was not detected in the numerous tissues/cell types present in the other structures present, which, as shown in the corresponding phase contrast micrograph (Fig. 1B), included the corneal stroma (cs), ciliary body (cb), and iris (i), among others. The specificity of the in situ hybridization was further confirmed by the extensive reaction observed with a positive control probe for the pro α2 chain of type I collagen (Fig. 1C), which is expressed in both mesenchymal and epithelial cells of ocular and non-ocular tissues and by the absence of any reaction with a negative control probe (the sense strand for ferritoid, Fig. 1D). Consistent with this specificity, Northern blots (Fig. 2) of total RNA from embryonic cornea (lane 1), brain, heart, liver, and skin (lanes 2–5), when probed with radiolabeled ferritoid cDNA, produced a signal of ∼1.6 kb only with the RNA from cornea.Fig. 2A Northern blot of total RNA isolated from embryonic chick tissues (all day 14 except skin, day 8) probed with radiolabeled ferritoid cDNA. Lanes are as follows: 1, cornea; 2, brain; 3, heart; 4, liver; 5, skin. The positions of the molecular size markers are shown along the left margin, and the integrity of the RNAs is shown by the presence of 28 S ribosomal RNA in ethidium bromide-stained samples (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Isolation of a Full-length Coding cDNA and Structural Analysis—To obtain a larger cDNA for ferritoid, clone 12C1-A2 (Fig. 3, single overline) was used to screen a chicken CE library (12Cai C.X. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12831-12839Google Scholar). This resulted in several clones, with the largest (1175 bp) having characteristics suggesting that it contains a full-length open reading frame. The 5′-end of the open reading frame contains a consensus sequence for a translation start site (Fig. 3, double overline), which is in-frame with an uninterrupted coding region of 830 bp, terminating at the 3′-end with a polyadenylation signal (Fig. 3, double underline) and a poly-A tail. The conceptual translation product contains two regions that fit with its proposed role as the nuclear transporter for ferritin. The first region contains a consensus SV40-like NLS (Fig. 3, light gray). The second region, located downstream of the NLS, is ferritin-like (Fig. 3, dark gray) and thus could be involved in the interaction with/binding to ferritin. This region: 1) is overall 55% similar to ferritin; 2) contains short sequences of similarity to ferritin (Fig. 4, yellow); and 3) is similar in size and structure to ferritin (described below). Also present are several potential phosphorylation sites (single underline).Fig. 4A comparison of the amino acid sequence of FTD and chicken FTN. Areas of similarity are highlighted in yellow. Amino acid similarities are shown between the two sequences with identity denoted by the amino acid and conservative substitutions with a plus sign. The amino acids shown in green are those conserved in ferritoid that have been shown previously by Santambrogio et al. (37Santambrogio P. Pinto P. Levi S. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Albertini A. Artymiuk P. Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 461-468Google Scholar) to be involved in the ferritin/ferritin interactions that occur during assembly of the ferritin supramolecular complex. The amino acid shown in pink has also been shown previously (37Santambrogio P. Pinto P. Levi S. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Albertini A. Artymiuk P. Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 461-468Google Scholar) to be involved in ferritin/ferritin interactions but is not conserved between ferritin and ferritoid. The helical regions in ferritin (30Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Google Scholar) are shown as bracketed regions designated A–E. The predicted helical regions in ferritoid are shown as bracketed regions designated A′–E′.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ferritoid structure was analyzed further using computer programs that predict secondary and tertiary structures. The secondary structure of ferritoid, determined using the 123D+ program (29Alexandrov N.N. Nussinov R. Zimmer R.M. Hunter L. Klein T.E. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, Kohala Coast, HI, January 3–6, 1996. World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore1995: 53-72Google Scholar), showed the ferritin-like region to have structural similarities to the H-chain of ferritin itself, the chief one being the presence of the five helical domains (Fig. 4, labeled A′–E′). When the helical domains of ferritoid were aligned with those of ferritin (using the PredictProtein program (28Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Google Scholar)), the only difference was helix D, which in the ferritin-H chain is a single domain but in ferritoid is predicted to be divided into two (in Fig. 4, designated D1′ and D2′). As mentioned above, a characteristic that might be expected for a molecule that assists in the nuclear transport of another molecule is an interaction between the two. Consistent with this, the conserved amino acids in the helical regions of ferritoid and ferritin include 9 (Fig. 4, green) of the 10 amino acids that have been demonstrated previously by mutation analysis (37Santambrogio P. Pinto P. Levi S. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Albertini A. Artymiuk P. Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 461-468Google Scholar) to be involved in certain of the interactions between ferritin subunits during assembly of the supramolecular ferritin complex. Other structural evidence for such an interaction between ferritoid and ferritin comes from a three-dimensional analysis in which we inserted the sequence of ferritoid into the known crystal structure of the human ferritin-H monomer (using the Cn3D 3.0 program). The results suggest that the short ferritin-like sequences in ferritoid (Fig. 5, shown in red) are not distributed randomly along the helices but are located preferentially at the surface, again where they may interact with/bind to ferritin. Ferritoid/Ferritin Interaction—To test experimentally whether ferritoid and ferritin associate with one another, coimmunoprecipitations were employed to determine whether an antibody against one component, either anti-ferritoid or anti-ferritin, would co-precipitate the other component. For this, CE cells were co-transfected with constructs for both components, and then lysates of transfected cells were co-immunoprecipitated and subsequently analyzed for ferritoid and ferritin by immunoblotting. Since no antibody currently exists against ferritoid, the CE cells were transfected with V5-tagged ferritoid, which allowed for the use of an antibody against the V5 tag for subsequent immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting. In addition, to ensure that only newly synthesized proteins from the transfected constructs were analyzed, a c-Myc-tagged ferritin construct was employed that allowed the ferritin component to be detected in immunoblots with an antibody against the Myc epitope (9E10). The immunoprecipitations were performed either with the anti-V5 antibody for ferritoid or with the anti-chicken ferritin-H antibody (6D11) for"

Therefore, growth in vitro requires the presence of NAD itself, NMN, or nicotinamide riboside (NR). To address uptake abilities of these compounds, we investigated outer membrane proteins. By analyzing ompP2 knockout mutants, we found that NAD and NMN uptake was prevented, whereas NR uptake was not. Through investigation of the properties of purified OmpP2 in artificial lipid membrane systems, the substrate specificity of OmpP2 for NAD and NMN was determined, with KS values of ∼8 and 4mm, respectively, in 0.1 m KCl, whereas no interaction was detected for the nucleoside NR and other purine or pyrimidine nucleotide or nucleoside species. Based on our analysis, we assume that an intrinsic binding site within OmpP2 exists that facilitates diffusion of these compounds across the outer membrane, recognizing carbonyl and exposed phosphate groups. Because OmpP2 was formerly described as a general diffusion porin, an additional property of acting as a facilitator for nicotinamide-based nucleotide transport may have evolved to support and optimize utilization of the essential cofactor sources NAD and NMN in H. influenzae.

Because OmpP2 was formerly described as a general diffusion porin, an additional property of acting as a facilitator for nicotinamide-based nucleotide transport may have evolved to support and optimize utilization of the essential cofactor sources NAD and NMN in H. influenzae. The only known natural habitat of Haemophilus influenzae is the human nasopharynx. H. influenzae is Gram-negative and is able to grow under facultative anaerobic conditions. It is also a human pathogen and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in young children (1Funkhouser A. Steinhoff M.C. Ward J. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1991; 13: S542-S554Google Scholar, 2Turk D.C. J. Med. Microbiol. 1984; 18: 1-16Google Scholar). To cultivate H. influenzae, a complex medium is required; and if not blood-based, it must contain two growth factors: NAD and hemin (3Evans N.M. Smith D.D. Wicken A.J. J. Med. Microbiol. 1974; 7: 359-365Google Scholar). In the nasopharynx, H. influenzae finds a relatively constant environment, and the organism has retained a certain degree of flexibility in its ability to utilize nutrients (4Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17410-17416Google Scholar) by possessing some limiting metabolic pathway redundancy (5Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. J. Theor. Biol. 2000; 203: 249-283Google Scholar). Early biochemical investigations have established that NMN 1The abbreviations used are: NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotides; NR, nicotinamide riboside; OMPs, outer membrane proteins; OM, outer membrane; BHI, brain-heart infusion; nS, nanosiemens. and nicotinamide riboside (NR) can substitute for NAD, whereas nicotinamide, niacin, or other nicotine-based intermediates of the Preiss-Handler pathway cannot (6Gingrich W. Schlenk F. J. Bacteriol. 1944; 47: 535-550Google Scholar, 7Leder I.G. Handler P. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 189: 889-899Google Scholar, 8Shifrine M. Biberstein E.L. Nature. 1960; 187: 623Google Scholar). The NAD dependence of H. influenzae was confirmed by the absence of genes encoding the enzymes necessary for the de novo biosynthesis of NAD (9Fleischmann R.D. Adams M.D. White O. Clayton R.A. Kirkness E.F. Kerlavage A.R. Bult C.J. Tomb J.F. Dougherty B.A. Merrick J.M. McKenny K. Sutton G.G. et al.Science. 1995; 269: 496-512Google Scholar). Accumulation of nicotinamide nucleotides derived from NAD or NR has been demonstrated in H. influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae (10Godek C.P. Cynamon M.H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 1473-1479Google Scholar, 11Cynamon M.H. Sorg T.B. Patapow A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2789-2799Google Scholar). For H. parainfluenzae, the Km for transport is ∼0.55 μm for NAD and 0.14 μm for NR, and the Vmax for NR is about four times that of NAD (11Cynamon M.H. Sorg T.B. Patapow A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2789-2799Google Scholar). This implies that NR is the substrate for an as yet unidentified inner membrane transporter. Recently, we presented data showing that two gene products appear to be involved in the NAD utilization pathway of H. influenzae (12Reidl J. Schlor S. Kraiss A. Schmidt-Brauns J. Kemmer G. Soleva E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1573-1581Google Scholar, 13Kemmer G. Reilly T.J. Schmidt-Brauns J. Zlotnik G.W. Green B.A. Fiske M.J. Herbert M. Kraiss A. Schlor S. Smith A. Reidl J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3974-3981Google Scholar, 14Schmidt-Brauns J. Herbert M. Kemmer G. Kraiss A. Schlor S. Reidl J. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2001; 291: 219-225Google Scholar). The gene products were identified as the hel-encoded outer membrane lipoprotein e(P4) and a periplasmic protein termed NadN. Knockout mutations of both genes resulted in growth-deficient phenotypes depending on the NAD concentrations provided in the growth medium. The enzymatic activities of both proteins were characterized. NadN has the ability to act as an NAD pyrophosphatase as well as an NMN 5′-nucleotidase. Furthermore, for e(P4), we showed that it acts as an NMN 5′-nucleotidase and that deletion or point mutants in hel affect the growth of H. influenzae and the uptake of NAD and NMN. Finally, an nadN hel double mutant was constructed, which was unable to utilize NAD or NMN and could grow only in the presence of NR (13Kemmer G. Reilly T.J. Schmidt-Brauns J. Zlotnik G.W. Green B.A. Fiske M.J. Herbert M. Kraiss A. Schlor S. Smith A. Reidl J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3974-3981Google Scholar). It becomes more and more apparent that specialized outer membrane proteins (OMPs) play a key role in bacterial adaptation in host niches (15Lin J. Huang S. Zhang Q. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 325-331Google Scholar). In H. influenzae, a number of OMPs have been characterized, but none of them have been assigned as facilitators for specific substrates. Of the major OMPs, OmpP2, with a molecular mass of ∼40 kDa, was described previously (16Hansen E.J. Gonzales F.R. Chamberlain N.R. Norgard M.V. Miller E.E. Cope L.D. Pelzel S.E. Gaddy B. Clausell A. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2709-2716Google Scholar, 17Munson Jr., R. Bailey C. Grass S. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 1797-1803Google Scholar, 18Cope L.D. Pelzel S.E. Latimer J.L. Hansen E.J. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3312-3318Google Scholar). It was found that ompP2 knockout mutants are viable under laboratory conditions, but are deleterious in an animal model, thus indicating an important role for bacterial physiology and infection under in vivo conditions. Through investigation of permeability channels of outer membrane (OM) samples of H. influenzae type b, a 40-kDa OMP was described previously as a diffusion porin with an exclusion size of ∼1400 Da (19Vachon V. Lyew D.J. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 918-924Google Scholar), which was then found to correspond to OmpP2 (16Hansen E.J. Gonzales F.R. Chamberlain N.R. Norgard M.V. Miller E.E. Cope L.D. Pelzel S.E. Gaddy B. Clausell A. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2709-2716Google Scholar). Variations in OmpP2 porins of different non-typeable H. influenzae isolates were found to cluster in a surface-exposed protein domain (20Bell J. Grass S. Jeanteur D. Munson Jr., R.S. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2639-2643Google Scholar). OmpP2 porins of different non-typeable H. influenzae isolates from antibiotic-treated cystic fibrosis patients have been collected and tested for antibiotic permeability and channel properties (21Regelink A.G. Dahan D. Moller L.V. Coulton J.W. Eijk P. Van Ulsen P. Dankert J. Van Alphen L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 226-232Google Scholar). The OmpP2 variants have different properties due to variation and accumulation of point mutations in distinct protein domains (21Regelink A.G. Dahan D. Moller L.V. Coulton J.W. Eijk P. Van Ulsen P. Dankert J. Van Alphen L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 226-232Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that OmpP2 is involved in binding between bacterial cells and human nasopharyngeal mucin (22Reddy M.S. Bernstein J.M. Murphy T.F. Faden H.S. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1477-1479Google Scholar). In this study, we show that OmpP2 has an additional property that can be best described as specialized porin for the nicotinamide ribonucleotides NMN and NAD, but not for the nucleoside NR. An ompP2 knockout mutant showed an uptake deficiency for NAD and NMN substrates, but NR uptake was even higher than the wild-type level. Furthermore, purified OmpP2 porin was utilized in artificial lipid membrane systems, and conductivity was determined in the presence of different nucleotides and nucleosides. We found that only NAD and NMN caused a decrease in conductivity. This indicates that not only is OmpP2 a general diffusion pore, but it also has a similar function as the carbohydrate-specific porins of the OMs of enteric bacteria such as LamB and ScrY (23Luckey M. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 167-171Google Scholar, 24Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Google Scholar, 25Schulein K. Schmid K. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2233-2241Google Scholar). Bacterial Strains and Media—The H. influenzae reference strain Rd KW20 was originally obtained from A. Wright (Tufts University, Boston). This strain was used for the construction of mutants in ompP2. H. influenzae cells were grown at 37 °C under aerobic conditions on 3.8% brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar (Difco) supplemented with NAD (15–30 μm), NMN (30 μm), or NR (30 μm) and hemin chloride (20 μg/ml) (Sigma). NMN and NR were prepared as described previously (13Kemmer G. Reilly T.J. Schmidt-Brauns J. Zlotnik G.W. Green B.A. Fiske M.J. Herbert M. Kraiss A. Schlor S. Smith A. Reidl J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3974-3981Google Scholar). For the H. influenzae Rd ompP2::cat mutant, chloramphenicol (2 μg/ml) was used in the growth medium. Construction and Characterization of the H. influenzae Mutant Strain ompP2::cat—To generate an ompP2 knockout mutant, PCR-constructed DNA fragments containing 500 bp of the immediate upstream sequence and 400 bp of the immediate downstream sequence flanking the ompP2 gene were generated (see Fig. 1A). Synthesis of these PCR fragments was carried out according to Mullis and Faloona (26Mullis K.B. Faloona F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Google Scholar) using the following synthetic oligonucleotides (synthesized by MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany): 2P2-3 (5′-CCAGAACTAGAAAGTTTTAC-3′) and 3P2SnaBI (5′-AAATACGTAAAAGCAAGGGCGAATCGAAAGA-3′); and 5P2-5 (5′-CACGCTTTATAGTGATAGCC-3′) and 5P2PstI (5′-AACTGCAGCTCCAATAGAATTGTCCAATCGCC-3′), respectively. In addition, an ∼1-kbp cat gene, encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, was obtained by fragment isolation via gel separation using QIAGEN-Quick (QIAGEN, Frankfurt, Germany) and was derived from plasmid pAKcat (27Kraiss A. Schlor S. Reidl J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4697-4702Google Scholar) digested with SnaBI and PstI. A ligation reaction was performed with the two PCR DNA fragments (treated with restriction enzymes SnaBI and PstI) and the cat gene fragment according to Maniatis et al. (28Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Habor, NY1982Google Scholar). The ligation mixture was used as template in PCRs utilizing oligonucleotides 2P2-3 and 5P2-5. As a result, a 1.9-kbp DNA fragment was amplified. Upon restriction analysis, this fragment was identified as a DNA fragment containing the cat gene flanked by 500 bp of ompP2 upstream sequence and 400 bp of ompP2 downstream sequence (data not shown). Next, this DNA fragment was used and transformed into H. influenzae strain Rd, which was made competent for DNA uptake according to the method of Barcak et al. (29Barcak G.J. Chandler M.S. Redfield R.J. Tomb J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 321-342Google Scholar). The transformed cells were plated onto BHI agar containing chloramphenicol. After 2 days, chloramphenicol-resistant H. influenzae colonies were observed and purified. Chromosomal DNA was prepared; and utilizing the chromosomal DNA as template and oligonucleotides 2P2-3 and 5P2-5, we verified the cat insertion onto the chromosome by PCR analysis (data not shown). The data indicated that the cat gene had been acquired by double crossover and therefore had replaced ompP2 on the chromosome (see Fig. 1). Uptake Studies—H. influenzae strain Rd and mutant strain Rd ompP2::cat from overnight cultures were inoculated in BHI agar (3.8%) supplemented with NAD (10 μm) and hemin chloride (20 μg/ml) and grown to A490 = 2. Cells were then harvested; washed with BHI; resuspended to A490 = 2 (corresponding to 1.5 × 109 colony-forming units/ml); and used for the uptake of [14C]NAD, [14C]NMN, and [14C]NR as described previously (13Kemmer G.

To determine the Vmax and Km values for NAD and NMN uptake, substrate concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 8 μm were used, and wild-type and mutant ompP2 strains were tested. For the wild-type Rd strain, a Lineweaver-Burk fit by least-squares linear regression analysis could be applied for NAD and NMN uptake. The specific activity of [carbonyl-14C]NAD was 81,000 cpm/nmol. NMN and NAD uptake was monitored at time points ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 min and from 2 to 18 min, respectively. OmpP2 Extraction—OmpP2 was isolated and purified starting from 1 liter of culture of the H. influenzae Rd KW20 strain grown to A490 = 1 under the conditions described above. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 10 min in a Sorvall RC5 B centrifuge and washed once with buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in 25 ml of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) supplemented with proteinase inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and were passed three times through a French pressure cell. Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant containing the broken cells was portioned in 2-ml aliquots, and the cell membrane was pelleted by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. OM preparation was carried out according to Carlone et al. (30Carlone G.M. Thomas M.L. Rumschlag H.S. Sottnek F.O. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 330-332Google Scholar). In brief, the cell membrane pellets were resuspended in 1% sodium N-lauryl sarcosinate and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to remove most of the soluble inner membrane components. The pellets of the subsequent centrifugation were washed once with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer supplemented with proteinase inhibitor (Bio-Rad). The probes contained ∼1 mg/ml protein from OM components, including the channel-forming activity. The probes were pooled, and the OM was pelleted by a subsequent centrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C (Beckman Optima Ti-70.1 rotor). The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 0.05% Zwittergent 3–12 (Calbiochem) and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of the same buffer, and the mixture was centrifuged again. To solubilize OmpP2, the pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 0.4% Zwittergent, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 mm EDTA and incubated for 30 min on ice. The OM was pelleted by centrifugation at 48,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C (Beckman Optima, Ti-70.1 rotor). The pellet was subjected to the same procedure again. The supernatants of both extractions were pooled and used for preparative SDS-PAGE or subjected to anion-exchange chromatography. SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) as described previously (13Kemmer G. Reilly T.J. Schmidt-Brauns J. Zlotnik G.W. Green B.A. Fiske M.J. Herbert M. Kraiss A. Schlor S. Smith A. Reidl J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3974-3981Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver. Preparative SDS-PAGE was used for identification and purification of the channel-forming activity from the extracts of OM fractions obtained by sodium N-lauryl sarcosinate treatment of the cell envelopes. 15 μl of the 0.4% Zwittergent supernatant (protein concentration of ∼0.2 mg/ml) were mixed with 7 μl of colorless sample buffer and added to one pocket of the preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel. One lane of the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to localize the different protein bands. Unstained lanes with different molecular mass ranges were cut into slices and eluted overnight with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1% Genapol X-80. Anion-exchange Chromatography—The supernatant from the extraction with 0.4% Zwittergent was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose anion-exchange column (1-ml HiTrap Q, Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Bound OmpP2 protein was eluted by a linear NaCl gradient in 0.05% Zwittergent and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The fractions were collected and checked for purity by SDS-PAGE. Fractions collected at 550 mm NaCl contained pure OmpP2 protein and were used for reconstitution in black lipid bilayer membranes. Determination of Conductivity and Titration Experiments with Nicotinamide Compounds—The methods used for the lipid bilayer experiments have been described in detail previously (32Benz R. Janko K. Boos W. Lauger P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 511: 305-319Google Scholar). Black lipid bilayer membranes were obtained from a 1% (w/v) solution of diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in n-decane. The single-channel records were performed using Ag/AgCl electrodes (with salt bridges) connected in series to a voltage source and a current-to-voltage converter made with a Burr Brown operational amplifier. OmpP2 was added from the concentrated stock solution either to the aqueous phase bathing a membrane in the black state or immediately prior to membrane formation. The temperature was kept at 20 °C throughout. Binding of nucleosides and nucleotides to OmpP2 was investigated in the same way as the binding of malto-oligosaccharides to carbohydrate-specific porins (24Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Google Scholar, 33Benz R. Schmid A. Nakae T. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 978-986Google Scholar). Binding of the substrate to a binding site inside the channel could be detected by a reduced ion flux through the channel. After the membrane turned black, the protein was added to the aqueous compartment (final concentration of 100 ng/ml). The membrane conductance increased upon reconstitution of channels. After 20–30 min, the increase slowed down; and when the conductance was nearly constant, the titration experiment was started. Nucleosides or nucleotides were added in defined concentrations to both sides of the membrane. If the compounds bound to the OmpP2 channel, the membrane conductance decreased in a dose-dependent manner as result of the reduced ion flux. The stability constant (K) of the binding could be analyzed using Equation 1 (24Benz R. Schmid A. Vos-Scheperkeuter G.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 100: 21-29Google Scholar), Gmax−G(c)Gmax=K·cK·c+1(Eq. 1) where Gmax is the initial conductance in the absence of substrate, and G(c) is the conductance at substrate concentration c. The half-saturation constant (KS) is given by the inverse stability constant 1/K. As shown under “Results,” the fit of the titration data using Equation 1 was not satisfactory in all cases. This could be explained by the assumption either that the OmpP2 channels did not close completely when they were occupied by the different compounds or that only a fraction of the OmpP2 channels closed completely. In general, a much better fit was possible with Equation 2, which took this problem into account, Gmax−G(c)Gmax=(1−G∞Gmax)·K·cK·c+1(Eq. 2) where G∞ is the conductance at very high substrate concentration, i.e. the fraction of the conductance that did not respond to the nicotinamide compounds. Phenotype of H. influenzae ompP2::cat Mutants and Utilization of NAD, NMN, and NR—An ompP2 deletion mutant was constructed by replacing ompP2 with the cat gene (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 1A). Expression of the 40-kDa OmpP2 protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE of OMP preparations. As a result, we found that the OmpP2 band was missing in the constructed ompP2 knockout strain (Fig. 1B). Upon comparison of the growth of the ompP2::cat mutant strain on BHI agar and liquid medium supplemented with NAD, NMN, or NR, a general growth-deficient phenotype was observed, similar to that described previously (16Hansen E.J. Gonzales F.R. Chamberlain N.R. Norgard M.V. Miller E.E. Cope L.D. Pelzel S.E. Gaddy B. Clausell A. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2709-2716Google Scholar). However, this attenuated growth rate could not be compensated by adding increasing concentrations of NAD or NMN and also did not differ in the presence of NR (data not shown). Therefore, a decreased diffusion of substrates such as NAD and NMN in an ompP2 mutant alone is not responsible for a reduced growth rate; thus, other relevant substrates are taken up across the OM via OmpP2. However, by analyzing the uptake of [14C]NAD, [14C]NMN, and [14C]NR, we found a significant uptake deficiency for NAD and NMN (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, if NR was used as substrate, the mutant ompP2 strain showed at least the same level of accumulation compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 2C). In addition, we determined the Vmax and Km values for substrates NMN and NAD (Table I). For the wild-type strain, it was possible to obtain the absolute values according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In contrast, for the ompP2 mutant, no absolute values for Vmax and Km could be determined. This was because up to the highest possible amount of labeled substrate (8 μm), the uptake rates still increased linearly, and no saturation could be observed. This indicated that the concentration range used in the experiments was below the Km; and therefore, the Michaelis-Menten equation can be reduced to V = Vmax·c/Km, indicating that the slope of the linear dependence between the uptake rate and the substrate concentration is Vmax/Km. This procedure allowed quantitative comparison with the wild-type strain. We found that the Vmax/Km ratios were ∼10-fold lower for the ompP2 mutant (Table I).Table IVmax and Km values for NAD and NMN uptake For the wild-type Rd strain, it was possible to determine the Km and Vmax for NAD and NMN uptake according to Lineweaver-Burk fits by least-squares linear regression analysis. The uptake rates of the RdΔompP2 mutant were too small and did not allow the calculation of Vmax and Km. For comparison with the wild-type strain, we deduced the Vmax/Km ratio from the slope of the uptake rate (V) plotted against the substrate concentrations (see “Results”). The kinetic data refer to 1.5 × 109 colony-forming units/ml.StrainNADNMNVmaxKmVmax/KmVmaxKmVmax/KmμM min-1μMmin-1μM min-1μMmin-1Wild-type Rd0.135.50.0240.596.40.092RdΔompP20.0020.009 Open table in a new tab Conductivity of OMPs of the Wild-type and Mutant ompP2 Strains—We studied the OM fractions of wild-type H. influenzae (strain Rd KW20) and the ompP2 deletion mutant for channel formation in lipid bilayer membranes. The OMs were dissolved in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1% Genapol X-80. Lipid bilayer experiments demonstrated that the OM of the wild-type strain contained a channel-forming protein with a single-channel conductance of ∼1.6 nS in 1 m KCl. Only small amounts of the dissolved membrane fraction had to be added for high reconstitution rates. In contrast, the probability for channel formation observed with the dissolved OM fraction of the ompP2 deletion strain was very low. Here, the channel-forming protein with a conductance of 1.6 nS was absent. The majority of channels observed with the ompP2 deletion strain had a single-channel conductance of ∼2.5 nS in 1 m KCl. We conclude that OmpP2 protein is the origin of the 1.6-nS conductance steps. Purification of OmpP2—Many porins expressed by enteric bacteria are firmly attached to the peptidoglycan layer (34Nikaido H. Rosenberg E.Y. Foulds J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 232-240Google Scholar), indicating that they can be isolated starting from the peptidoglycan-protein complex. OmpP2 represents an exception because it is only loosely associated with the peptidoglycan (19Vachon V. Lyew D.J. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 918-924Google Scholar), and different solubilization and isolation procedures have been used starting from whole cells or the cell envelope (19Vachon V. Lyew D.J. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 918-924Google Scholar, 35Munson Jr., R.S. Shenep J.L. Barenkamp S.J. Granoff D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 677-684Google Scholar). To purify OmpP2, we started from the OM fraction obtained by N-lauryl sarcosinate treatment of the cell envelope. The OM pellet was resuspended twice in buffer containing 0.05% Zwittergent, followed by centrifugation. The supernatants from the 0.05% Zwittergent treatments contained only very low channel-forming activity, indicating that OmpP2 porin was not dissolved by this procedure and was retained in the pellet. In the next step, the pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 0.4% Zwittergent and 10 mm EDTA and was kept on ice for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged, and the pellet was subjected to the same procedure again. The supernatants of both extractions contained high channel-forming activity in the lipid bilayer assay. SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the 0.4% Zwittergent extracts contained OmpP2 as the major band (Fig. 3, lane 2). Final purification of OmpP2 was achieved by preparative SDS-PAGE or by anion-exchange chromatography. For purification by preparative SDS-PAGE, the supernatant was loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Different molecular mass bands were excised and eluted overnight with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1% Genapol-X80 at 4 °C. The fraction with the highest channel-forming activity contained pure OmpP2 protein essentially free of contaminants as proven by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Alternatively, OmpP2 was purified by anion-exchange chromatography. The supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Q column, and a linear salt gradient was used to elute bound protein. Fractions collected at 550 mm NaCl contained pure protein, which was identified as OmpP2 by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, lane 3). OmpP2 protein purified by ion-exchange chromatography formed the same channels as Genapol X-80 extracts of the OM and the protein derived from preparative SDS-PAGE. This shows that purification by preparative SDS-PAGE does not affect the channel-forming ability of OmpP2. Characterization of OmpP2—OmpP2 has been characterized previously in experiments using lipid bilayer membranes (36Vachon V. Laprade R. Coulton J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 861: 74-82Google Scholar). To verify that the channel properties of purified OmpP2 used in this study are similar to those described in the previous work, we performed single-channel and multichannel measurements using lipid bilayer membranes from diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine/n-decane. The addition of pure OmpP2 at a very low concentration (100 ng/ml) to a black lipid membrane caused a substantial conductance increase over several orders of magnitude similar to that caused by other bacterial porins (37Benz R. Hackenbek R. Ghuysen J.-M. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam1994: 397-423Google Scholar). Under conditions of appropriate amplification and low protein concentration, the recording of single events of pore integration into the membrane could be resolved as conductance steps (see Fig. 4 for a single-channel recording in 1 m KCl). Fig. 5 shows a histogram of all current fluctuations observed with OmpP2 in 1 m KCl. The data suggest that the current fluctuations are fairly homogeneous.Fig. 5Histogram of the probability of the occurrence of certain conductivity units observed with membranes formed from diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine/n-decane in the presence of 50 ng/ml OmpP2 from H. influenzae.

Long chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A (CoA) as well as CoA thioesters of xenobiotic amphipathic carboxylates (e.g. hypolipidemic fibrate drugs or substituted dioic acids) have now been reported to specifically bind to HNF-4α (21Hertz R.

HNF-4α ligands modulate its secondary structure and its transcriptional activity as a function of their chain length, degree of unsaturation, or respective substitutions (21Hertz R. Magenheim J.

Thus, fatty acids of C14-C16 activate, whereas long chain (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g. C20:5, C22:6) and hypolipidemic fibrate or Medica drugs suppress HNF-4α transcriptional activity in transfection assays. Activation/inhibition of HNF-4α transcriptional activity by its acyl-CoA ligands or by its free acid proligands is due to modulating its binding affinity to its DNA cognate enhancers (21Hertz R.

In analogy with other nuclear receptors, transactivation of HNF-4α is mediated by protein coactivators (e.g. CBP (cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein)/P300, PGC-1, and others) (27Yoshida E.

Missense mutants of the ligand binding domain of HNF-4α are shown here to be defective in transactivation capacity due to their reduced binding affinities for HNF-4α agonist ligands. The mutants are rescued by excess agonist ligands, reaching activities in the wild type range. These findings may indicate the means for treating selected MODY-1 subjects with HNF-4α agonist nutrients or drugs. Plasmids and Reagents—The E276Q, V255M, Q185A, Q185K, and C179W mutants of HNF-4α1 were prepared by the Kunkel method (31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) or by the Stratagene mutagenesis kit (La Jolla, CA). The full-length HNF-4α1 wild type and its respective mutants were cloned in pSG5 vector. GAL4-DBD-HNF-4α-LBD chimera, consisting of the DBD of GAL4 and the LBD (amino acids 132–410) of HNF-4α1 wild type or respective mutants, were prepared by fusing respective rat or human HNF-4α-LBD to the C-terminal end of yeast GAL4-DBD. CAT reporter plasmids for the full-length HNF-4α1 consisted of the (–854/+22) apoC-III gene promoter or 3 copies of the C3P enhancer of the apoC-III gene promoter upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter (32Hertz R. Bishara-Shieban J. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). CAT reporter plasmid for the GAL4-DBD-HNF-4α1-LBD chimera ((UAS)5-CAT) consisted of 5 copies of the GAL4 binding site upstream of the adenovirus E1b promoter. Expression plasmid for P300 was from R. Eckner (Zurich, Switzerland). PGC-1 was prepared by reverse transcription-PCR from liver total RNA of 24 h-starved mice (30Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G.X. Donovan J. Wu Z.D. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2001; 413: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar) and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3. Rat HNF-4α-LBD-(132–455) recombinant wild type and mutant proteins consisting of amino acids 132–455 were prepared by expressing the respective rHNF-4α1 cDNA synthesized by PCR with the 5′-CCGGCTCGAGGATGGCTTCCTGCTT-3′ and 5′-GCGCCATATGAGGTCAAGCTACGAG-3′ primers. The respective DNA fragments were cloned into the NdeI/XhoI site of pET21b plasmid (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI) and sequenced. The recombinants were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLyS strain of Escherichia coli, and the His-tagged proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on a nickel nitrilotriacetic resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), desalted, lyophilized, and stored at –70 °C. Purity of recombinants was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Transient Transfection—Cultured COS7, HeLa, Huh7, HepG2, and 293T cells were transiently transfected by the CaPi method. After transfection with expression plasmids for human or rat HNF-4α, the culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 60 μm albumin (21Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) or 10% fetal calf serum, respectively, supplemented with 150–200 μm indicated fatty acids. The cells were further incubated for 24–48 h. CAT activity in the cell extracts was normalized to β-galactosidase, used as internal control for transfection. Ligand Binding—Binding of fatty acyl-CoA to recombinant HNF-4α-LBD-(132–455) wild type or missense mutants was measured by the extent of quenching of the intrinsic emission fluorescence of tryptophan residues at 330 nm when excited at 280 nm in the presence of increasing concentrations of C14:0-CoA (23Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23988-23999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of 40 ng of the respective recombinant protein and the indicated concentrations of C14:0-CoA in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 10% glycerol, 0.3 m NaCl, and 1.0 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, with continuous stirring at room temperature. Binding curves were plotted as (F0–F) versus ligand concentration, where F0 is the initial fluorescence, and F is fluorescence at each titration point. Binding curves were linearized by plotting 1/1–(Fi/Fmax) versus [L]/(Fi/Fmax) according to Equation 1, 1/(1−F1/Fmax)=nE0/Kd+(1/Kd)([L]/Fi/Fmax)(Eq. 1) where Fi is the fluorescence emission intensity at a given titration point, Fmax is the fluorescence emission maximum at binding saturation, [L] is the ligand concentration, n is the number of binding sites, E0 is the protein concentration used in the assay, and Kd is the dissociation constant (23Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23988-23999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Alternatively, binding parameters were calculated by fitting the binding curves to the Hill equation as previously described (23Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23988-23999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Binding of free fatty acid to recombinant HNF-4α-(132–455) wild type or missense mutants was measured by following the fluorescence emission maxima at 530 nm with excitation at 480 nm upon reverse titration of 100 nm NBD-C18:0 with increasing HNF-4α-LBD-(132–410) wild type or mutants recombinant proteins (23Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23988-23999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Binding curves were plotted as fluorescence intensity versus protein concentration. Apparent dissociation constants K′ = (Kd)n were calculated by a Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/F versus 1/[HNF4αLBD]n, where F is the fluorescence intensity, and n is the number of binding sites chosen for the best linear fit (33Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1981: 365-375Google Scholar). Fatty Acid Analysis of Recombinant HNF-4α Variants—Samples of 350 μg of HNF-4α-LBD-(132–455) variants were mixed with 5.0 nmol of C17:0 serving as internal standard and were extracted with 10 volumes of chloroform:methanol 2:1 (v/v). The N2-dried organic extract was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark with a mixture containing 50 μl of methanol, 50 μl of 0.08 m trimethylsilyldiazomethane in heptane, and 60 μl of ether to yield the fatty acyl methyl esters. After derivatization, the mixture was dried under N2, dissolved in chloroform, and subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis using a Quatro II Micromass quadropole mass spectrometer coupled to a gas chromatograph (15 m DB-1 gas chromatograph capillary column (J&W Scientific, CA)) and programmed to increase temperatures from 120 to 230 °Cat6.4 °C/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact mode at ionization energy of 70 eV, source temperature of 190 °C, and using a scan range of 100–400 Da. Methyl esters were identified by their respective retention time, molecular ion, and fragmentation pattern based on known standards. Transcriptional activation by wild type HNF-4α in transfection assays in the absence of added exogenous ligands prompted us to search for putative ligand-dependent transactivation by making use of transactivation-defective mutants of HNF-4α.

Gln-185 and Cys-179 of helix 3 were selected for site-directed mutagenesis of HNF-4α-LBD in light of the strictly conserved VC179ESMKEQ185 sequence of HNF-4α from Drosophila to humans and in light of Gln-185 homology with Gln280 of RXRα. Gln-280 of RXRα is intimately associated with the bound oleic acid in the ligand binding pocket of RXRα (36Vivat V. Zechel C. Wurtz J.M. Bourguet W. Kagechika H. Umemiya H. Shudo K. Moras D.

To evaluate the transactivation capacity of HNF-4α wild type and its mutants, the respective HNF-4α1-LBDs were fused with GAL4-DBD, and the transcriptional activity of the expressed chimera was analyzed in COS7 cells transfected with a reporter plasmid consisting of GAL4-responsive promoter upstream of CAT. Transactivation was robustly increased by the HNF-4α-LBD(WT) chimera while being significantly decreased or essentially zero with the human or rat HNF-4α-LBD(E276Q) mutants compared with their respective wild types (Fig. 1a). The pronounced loss of transactivation of the rat HNF-4α-LBD(E276Q) chimera as compared with the respective human mutant indicated that transactivation-defective MODY-1 mutations were better exemplified in the rat HNF-4α-LBD context. In line with previous reports, the extent of loss of transactivation of the HNF-4α-LBD(E276Q) mutant was dependent on the cell type used for transfection (11Suaud L. Hemimou Y. Formstecher P. Laine B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1162-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Navas M.A. Munoz-Elias E.J. Kim J. Shih D. Stoffel M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1459-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, transactivation by the GAL4-hHNF-4α-LBD(E276Q) mutant was similar to that of wild type HNF-4α in HeLa or 293 cells (not shown) but robustly impaired in COS7 (Fig. 1, a and b), Huh7 (Fig. 1b), or HepG2 (not shown) cells. In line with the previous report (12Navas M.A. Munoz-Elias E.J. Kim J. Shih D. Stoffel M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1459-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), transactivation was less affected by the conservative V255M than the nonconservative E276Q MODY-1 mutation (Fig. 1a). Similarly to MODY-1 mutants, transactivation by the rHNF-4α-LBD(Q185A), rHNF-4α-LBD(Q185K), and rHNF-4α-LBD(C179W) chimera was robustly decreased or essentially zero as compared with rHNF-4α-LBD(WT) (Fig. 1a). Loss of transactivation by the MODY-1 and other missense HNF-4α(LBD) mutants prompted us to attempt their rescue by HNF-4α agonist ligands. Myristic (C14:0) and palmitic (C16:0) acids were used in light of their reported efficacies in transactivating wild type HNF-4α (22Hertz R. Sheena V. Kalderon B. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 9-cis-Hexadecenoic acid (C16:1) was selected in light of being the predominant fatty acid bound to recombinant HNF-4α-LBD(WT) expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (24Wisely G.B. Miller A.B. Davis R.G. Thomquest Jr., A.D. Johnson R. Spitzer T. Sefler A. Shearer B. Moore J.T. Miller A.B. Willson T.M. Williams S.P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 37973-37976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The transactivation-defective human HNF-4α-LBD(E276Q) mutant was indeed rescued by C14:0 or C16:1 added to the culture medium, resulting in extending its transactivation capacity to wild type levels both in COS7 and Huh7 cells (Fig. 1b). Also, the E276Q mutation expressed in the rat HNF-4α-LBD context was dose-dependently rescued by C14:0, C16:0, or C16:1, resulting in increasing its transactivation by 15–20-fold within the 0–150 μm concentration range of added fatty acid (Fig. 1c). Similarly, the E276Q, V255M, Q185K, and Q185A (but not the C179W) mutations expressed in the rat HNF-4α-LBD context were effectively rescued by added C16:1 (Fig. 1d). The extent of activation by added ligand (Fig. 1d) was inversely proportional to the basal transactivation of respective mutants (Fig. 1a), being more evident with the highly impaired E276Q as compared with the V255M MODY-1 mutant as well as with the highly defective Q185K as compared with the Q185A mutant. Similarly, ligand activation of the wild type chimera by HNF-4α agonist ligands amounted to 2-fold only as compared with 5–25-fold activation of the MODY-1 and Gln-185 mutants (Fig. 1d). To further investigate the mode of ligand-dependent rescue of HNF-4α mutants, the combined effect of ligand and transcriptional coactivators of HNF-4α was analyzed in cells transfected with respective GAL4-HNF-4α-LBD mutant chimera and cotransfected with P300. Activation of GAL4-HNF-4α-LBD chimera by P300 in the absence of added ligand was limited and proportional to their basal transactivation capacity, being maximal with wild type HNF-4α and essentially zero with the highly defective Q185K mutant. However, the addition of C16:1 resulted in robust activation of the MODY-1 and Gln-185 (but not the C179W) mutants, reaching 50–200-fold activation in the presence of both C16:1 and P300 (Fig. 1d). Hence, the full scope of ligand-dependent rescue of HNF-4α mutants requires the synergistic activation by ligand and coactivator. Transcriptional transactivation mediated by the constitutive N-terminal AF-1 domain of HNF-4α-(1–22) (38Kistanova E. Dell H. Tsantili P. Falvey E. Cladaras C. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) fused to GAL4-DBD was unaffected by C16:1 (not shown), thus indicating that the synergistic interaction between ligand and AF-2 coactivators was specific. Rescue by ligand in the context of the full-length HNF-4α and an HNF-4α-responsive gene was verified in COS7 cells transfected with expression plasmids for the full-length HNF-4α variants and with a CAT reporter plasmid consisting of either the apoC-III gene promoter (Fig. 2a) or the HNF-4α cognate C3P enhancer of the apoC-III gene promoter upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter (32Hertz R. Bishara-Shieban J. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2b). Transcriptional activation of the apoC-III promoter by the full-length wild type rHNF-4α was apparently constitutive and essentially independent of added C16:1 both in the absence or presence of transfected P300 (Fig. 2a). However, transcriptional activation of the apoC-III promoter by the full-length rHNF-4α(E276Q) MODY-1 mutant was essentially zero in the absence of C16:1 but increased to wild type levels in the presence of both C16:1 and P300 (Fig. 2a). Similarly, defective transcription of the apoC-III promoter by the full-length human HNF-4α(E276Q) mutant was increased to wild type levels by added C16:1 even in the absence of transfected P300 (Fig. 2a). Also, null transcriptional activation of the C3P-enhanced heterologous promoter by the transactivation-defective rHNF-4α(E276Q) MODY-1 or rHNF-4α(Q185K) mutants reached wild type levels in the presence of C16:1 and P300, acting in concert (Fig. 2b). These data indicated that missense mutants of HNF-4α could be rescued by ligand acting synergistically with P300. The rescue specificity of agonist and antagonist ligands of HNF-4α was verified in transfected COS7 cells incubated in the presence of the respective HNF-4α ligands (21Hertz R. Magenheim J. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Nature. 1998; 392: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 22Hertz R. Sheena V. Kalderon B. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Biochem.

The rHNF-4α(E276Q) MODY-1 mutant was rescued by C16:1 and C14:0 but not by C20:5(ω-3), C22:6(ω-3), or xenobiotic HNF-4α antagonists (e.g. Medica 16 (22Hertz R. Sheena V. Kalderon B. Berman I. Bar-Tana J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 2c), thus indicating that ligand-dependent rescue was specific for agonist ligands of HNF-4α. The coactivator specificity was investigated by replacing P300 with PGC-1 (30Yoon J.C. Puigserver P. Chen G.X. Donovan J. Wu Z.D. Rhee J. Adelmant G. Stafford J. Kahn C.R. Granner D.K. Newgard C.B.

In the current study, we have tested the effects of hepatic expression of GMΔC, a truncated version of the muscle-targeting subunit isoform, in rats rendered insulin-deficient via injection of a single moderate dose of streptozotocin (STZ). Three key findings emerged. First, GMΔC expression in liver was sufficient to fully normalize blood glucose levels (from 335 ± 31 mg/dl prior to viral injection to 109 ± 28 mg/dl 6 days after injection) and liver glycogen content in STZ-injected rats. Second, this normalization occurred despite very low levels of liver glucokinase expression in the insulin-deficient STZ-injected rats. Finally, the hyperphagia induced by STZ injection was completely reversed by GMΔC expression in liver. In contrast to these findings with GMΔC, overexpression of another targeting subunit, GL, in STZ-injected rats caused a large increase in liver glycogen stores but only a transient decrease in food intake and blood glucose levels. The surprising demonstration of a glucose-lowering effect of GMΔC in the background of depressed hepatic glucokinase expression suggests that controlled stimulation of liver glycogen storage may be an effective mechanism for improving glucose homeostasis, even when normal pathways of glucose disposal are impaired.

Four members of a gene family have been described with varying tissue distributions: the major skeletal muscle isoform, GM (also known as RGl or PPP1R3); a liver enriched form, GL (also known as PPP1R4); and two forms with wide tissue distribution, protein targeting to glycogen (PTG or PPP1R5), and PPP1R6 (1Tang P.M.

All of these proteins share PP-1 and glycogen binding motifs and, to varying degrees, also bind the glycogen-metabolizing enzymes glycogen synthase, glycogen phosphorylase, and phosphorylase kinase.In recent years, we and others have expressed the various targeting subunits in mammalian cells in culture or in liver of intact animals, leading to new insights into their relative metabolic potencies and regulatory properties (5Newgard C.B.

Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1514-1523Google Scholar, 7Gasa R. Jensen P.B. Berman H.K. Brady M.J. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26396-26403Google Scholar). Surprisingly, GMΔC, but not GL or GM, ameliorates glucose intolerance when expressed in livers of rats fed on a high fat diet (8Gasa R. Clark C. Yang R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1524-1530Google Scholar). This appears to be explained by our finding that liver cells with overexpressed GMΔC maintain full responsiveness to glycogenolytic signals such as forskolin and low glucose, unlike cells with overexpressed GL or PTG, which have impaired responsiveness to these agents, resulting in accumulation of large amounts of glycogen in the fasted state (6Yang R. Cao L. Gasa R. Brady M.J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1514-1523Google Scholar, 8Gasa R. Clark C. Yang R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

Invest. 2000; 105: 479-488Google Scholar).In light of these encouraging findings, the current study has extended our investigation of the properties of GMΔC by its expression in liver of rats with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Three surprising observations have been made as a result of this work. First, we find that GMΔC expression in liver is sufficient to lower blood glucose levels and raise liver glycogen levels to normal in STZ-injected diabetic rats. Second, these corrective effects on hepatic glycogen metabolism and glucose homeostasis occur despite very low levels of liver glucokinase expression in the insulin-deficient animals. Finally, we also find that hepatic GMΔC expression reduces food intake to normal levels in STZ-diabetic rats, which are otherwise hyperphagic.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant Adenoviruses—A recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA encoding a truncated GM glycogen-targeting subunit isoform from which 735 C-terminal amino acids were removed (GMΔC) is termed AdCMV-GMΔC; its preparation has been described previously (6Yang R. Cao L. Gasa R. Brady M.J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1514-1523Google Scholar). A recombinant virus containing the cDNA encoding the full-length hepatic targeting subunit GL (AdCMV-GL) has also been described (6Yang R. Cao L. Gasa R. Brady M.J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1514-1523Google Scholar). Both the GMΔC and GL inserts include a C-terminal FLAG tag for ready identification of the transgene products by immunoblotting (6Yang R. Cao L. Gasa R. Brady M.J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1514-1523Google Scholar). As a control, some animals received a virus containing the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene, termed AdCMV-βGAL (10Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Google Scholar). These viruses were amplified and purified for injection into animals using previously described procedures (11Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 161-189Google Scholar).Animal Studies—Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 250–300 g were housed on a 12-h light-dark cycle and were allowed free access to water and standard laboratory chow (65% carbohydrate, 4% fat, 24% protein; Harlan Tekland laboratory diet 9100). These animals were injected with a single moderate dose of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg; Sigma S-0130) intraperitoneally, followed by daily monitoring of blood glucose levels in the ad libitum fed state, using an automated blood glucose analyzer (Hemocue AB; Angelholm, Sweden). Only those animals in which blood glucose rose to levels greater than 250 mg/dl within 3 days of STZ injection were studied further. Five days after STZ injection, 0.5 × 1012 particles of AdCMV-GMΔC, AdCMV-GL, or AdCMV-βGAL were administered via tail vein injection to rats anesthetized with intraperitoneal Nembutal (50 mg/kg of body weight; Abbott). As an additional control, some animals received no viral injection. After viral administration, animals were individually caged for daily monitoring of food intake, body weight, and blood glucose levels. Six days after viral administration, animals were sacrificed in the ad libitum fed state or following 18 h of fasting. A blood sample was taken, and liver and muscle samples were excised, rapidly clamp-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C for further analysis. In a separate set of STZ-injected and virus-treated animals, urine volume and glucose concentration was monitored by four 12-h collections of urine from individual rats and measurement of urine glucose using a glucose oxidase-based assay (Sigma).Measurement of RNA Levels in Liver—For analysis of RNA levels, liver samples were ground into powder under liquid nitrogen, and total mRNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (catalog no. 15596-018; Invitrogen). First-strand cDNAs were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions in a 50-μl total reaction mix using 2 μg of total mRNA, 3.2 μg of oligo-p(dT)15, and a cDNA synthesis kit (catalog no. 1-483-188; Roche Applied Science). The PCRs were carried out using 2 μl of the cDNA synthesis mixture, 0.5 μl of 20 μm stock solutions of the primer pairs for amplification of GMΔC (5′-primer, 5′-GAAGTACCTGGTCAGAACAGC-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-CTCTGGCTCAGGTTCCTTCTT-3′), glucokinase (5′-primer, 5′-TGGCCACAATGATCTCCTGCT-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-GGCTTTCGCGCATGCGATTTA-3′), GLUT2 (5′-primer, 5′-CACTGTCTTCACTGCAGTGCT-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-AGCATCAGTGCCACCACAATG-3′), glycogen synthase (5′-primer, 5′-TCCTTTCTCGTGCCAGGAAAC-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-TGGAGAACTCATACCTCCCAG-3′), or the internal control α-tubulin (5′-primer, 5′-GCGTGAGTGTATCTCCATCCA-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-GGTAGGTGCCAGTGCGAACTT-3′), and a PCR reaction mix containing 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (catalog no. 1-418-432; Roche Applied Science) and 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP (catalog no. 1-814-362; Roche Applied Science) in a 50-μl total reaction mix. The annealing temperature was 45 °C, and PCR mix was collected for analysis after a variable number of cycles (25 cycles for GMΔC and 32 cycles for glucokinase). The synthesized PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and detected by UV light using the VersaDoc imaging system (model 5000; Bio-Rad). The low DNA mass ladder (catalog no. 10068-013; Invitrogen) was used as a size standard, and the PCR products were quantified using the QuantityOne program (Bio-Rad).Real time quantitative PCR methods were utilized to measure glucokinase and hexokinase 1 mRNA levels. The PCRs were carried out using 2 μl of the cDNA synthesis mixture (1:100 dilution of the cDNA synthesis mix described above), 0.5 μl of 20 μm stock solutions of the primer pairs for amplification of glucokinase (5′-primer, 5′-AAGCACAAGAAACTGCCCCTGG-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-TTGCCACCACATCCATCTCAAAG-3′), hexokinase 1 (5′-primer, 5′-GGCACAGGCACCAATGCTTG-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-ACCCATCATCCCCAAAGGCTC-3′), or the internal control α-tubulin (5′-primer, 5′-GATGCTGCCAATAACTATGCCCG-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-AAAACCAAGAAGCCCTGGAGACC-3′) and SYBR green PCR supermix (catalog no. 170-8882; Bio-Rad) in a 25-μl total reaction mix. The annealing temperature was 54 °C, and PCR data were collected using the iCycler detector from Bio-Rad. The relative abundance of mRNA was calculated by comparative threshold cycle methods (Applied Biosystems, User Bulletin 2), using α-tubulin as the internal control.Immunoblot Analysis and Glycogen Measurements in Liver Samples—Powdered liver samples were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and proteinase inhibitors) using a Polytron homogenizer (model PT10–35; VWR Inc.), followed by two rounds of freeze-thawing. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 5 min, and total protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Glycogen was measured by extraction in 10% trichloroacetic acid, precipitation with methanol, and digestion of glycogen to free glucose by incubation with 0.4 mg/ml amyloglucosidase, as previously described (13Yang R. Wek S.A. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2706-2717Google Scholar).For analysis of GMΔC protein levels, samples were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 2 min, and 2 mg of total proteins were incubated with 10 μg of anti-FLAG antibody in 1 ml of buffer A (phosphate-buffered saline, 2% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C for 1 h. Then 20 μl of Ezview Red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (catalog no. F-2426; Sigma) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Samples were centrifuged at 8,000 × g and washed three times with buffer. The pellets were mixed with 50 μl of SDS-running buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h and treated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal serum specific for GM (1Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Google Scholar) (a generous gift of Dr. Anna A. Depaoli Roach, University of Indiana Medical Center) at a dilution of 1:1000. The membranes were washed and subsequently treated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. The protein-antibody complexes were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Glucokinase protein levels were analyzed as described previously (6Yang R. Cao L. Gasa R. Brady M.J. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1514-1523Google Scholar), using a rabbit polyclonal antiglucokinase antibody (14Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Johnson J.H. Lynch R.M. Hirose H. Tokuyama Y. Bell G.I. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 390-394Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:5000.Analysis of Plasma Variables—Plasma insulin, glucagon, and leptin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay kits (catalog no. RI-13K, GL-32K, and RL-83K, respectively; Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Plasma aspartate-aminotransferase, triglycerides, ketones, and lactate were measured using kits (procedure no. DG158-UV, 337, 310-UV, and 735, respectively; Sigma) as previously described (8Gasa R. Clark C. Yang R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1524-1530Google Scholar). Plasma free fatty acids were measured using the FFA-Half microtest kit (catalog no. 1-383-175; Roche Applied Science).Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired Student's t test using the statistics module of Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Excel X for Mac; Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Statistical significance was assumed at p < 0.05.RESULTSExpression of GMΔC in Liver of STZ-treated Rats—Our prior work has shown that expression of GMΔC in liver of rats with diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance results in reversal of glucose intolerance, in concert with stimulation of liver glycogen storage (8Gasa R. Clark C. Yang R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1524-1530Google Scholar). However, these studies did not address the utility of the targeting subunit to correct blood glucose levels in animals with frank diabetes. To investigate this point, we injected AdCMV-GMΔC or, as a control, AdCMV-βGAL into Wistar rats that received a single moderate dose of STZ (60 mg/kg). Only animals in which blood glucose exceeded a level of 250 mg/dl within 3 days of STZ injection (ad libitum fed state) and with blood aspartyl-aminotransferase activity of less than 200 units/ml after viral injection (indicative of the absence of virus-induced liver damage) were used for further study. As a first step in our analysis, we sought to confirm expression of GMΔC specifically in animals injected with the AdCMV-GMΔC virus. The cDNA insert contained in this virus includes a FLAG tag to allow specific identification of the virus-encoded protein. As shown in Fig. 1, multiplex PCR analysis of liver RNA reveals an RNA-derived band of the expected size only in animals that received the AdCMV-GMΔC virus and not in control animals (receiving either AdCMV-βGAL or no virus). Similarly, a protein detectable with an anti-FLAG antibody was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted only in liver samples from AdCMV-GMΔC-injected animals. It should be noted that we expect systemic administration of AdCMV-GMΔC to result in expression of GMΔC in a largely liver-specific fashion, based on prior analysis of a wide array of tissues in rats and mice infused with this and other recombinant adenoviruses (8Gasa R. Clark C. Yang R. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1524-1530Google Scholar, 10Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The glucose values for individual STZ-treated animals in the ad libitum fed state are shown immediately before and 6 days after injection of AdCMV-GMΔC (Fig. 2A) or in a control group injected with AdCMV-βGAL or left uninjected (Fig. 2B). All animals that received the AdCMV-GMΔC virus experienced a decline in blood glucose to the normal range, whereas this never occurred in AdCMV-βGAL-injected or uninjected controls. A summation of this data is provided in Fig. 2C and shows that control STZ-injected animals had no decline in average glucose values (381 ± 11 versus 379 ± 35 mg/dl prior to and 6 days after viral injection, respectively). In sharp contrast, AdCMV-GMΔC-injected animals experienced a decline in blood glucose from 335 ± 31 mg/dl prior to viral injection to 109 ± 28 mg/dl 6 days after injection, the latter value being indistinguishable from the average in normal controls (122 ± 10 mg/dl). We also examined blood glucose levels in rats following an overnight fast (Fig. 2D). Fasting caused a lowering of blood glucose levels into the normal range in all three groups of rats. AdCMV-GMΔC-treated, STZ-injected rats had blood glucose levels that were slightly and significantly lower than STZ-injected controls, but these values were not different from those in uninjected controls (75 ± 13, 89 ± 8, and 84 ± 13 mg/dl for the AdCMV-GMΔC-treated/STZ-injected, STZ-injected control, and uninjected control groups, respectively). Thus, AdCMV-GMΔC injection completely normalized blood glucose levels in STZ-diabetic rats.Fig. 2Lowering of blood glucose levels in STZ-treated animals by hepatic expression of GMΔC.A, individual STZ-injected animals prior to (closed diamonds) or 6 days after (open squares) infusion of AdCMV-GMΔC adenovirus. B, individual STZ-injected animals prior to (closed diamonds) or after infusion of AdCMV-βGAL virus or no viral infusion (open squares; a mixture of five animals that received the AdCMV-βGAL control virus and three animals that received no virus). C, summary of data in A and B. Data represent the mean ± S.E. for eight animals in each STZ-injected group and six animals in the “no STZ” group. *, blood glucose was lower in animals after treatment with AdCMV-GMΔC virus than before treatment, with p < 0.001. D, blood glucose levels in animals subjected to an overnight fast 5 days after virus injection.

Lehman D.L. Telemaque-Potts S. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2022-2027Google Scholar). Table I presents a profile of several key blood hormones and metabolites in the various groups of rats from the current study. With regard to key metabolic regulatory hormones, STZ injection resulted in a 68% decrease in circulating insulin levels relative to uninjected controls, with a similar decrease occurring in STZ-treated animals that received the AdCMV-GMΔC virus. These decreases in circulating insulin were accompanied by a 40% increase in glucagon levels in both groups. Thus, both groups of STZ-treated rats experienced a fall in insulin/glucagon ratio of ∼75% (from 0.12 to 0.03) despite the fact that one group was hyperglycemic (AdCMV-βGAL/uninjected controls) and the other normoglycemic (AdCMV-GMΔC-injected animals). Thus, lowering of blood glucose in the AdCMV-GMΔC-treated group was achieved by a mechanism independent of changes in insulin/glucagon ratio.Table IBlood metabolite and hormone levelsSTZSTZNo STZ (no virus)GMΔCAdCMV-βGAL/No virusInsulin (ng/dl)1.64 ± 0.6***1.35 ± 0.35***4.12 ± 0.76Glucagon (pg/ml)47.9 ± 10.3*46.4 ± 5.7*33.1 ± 2.4Triglyceride (mg/dl)61.3 ± 10.251.8 ± 14.551.1 ± 14.6FFA (μM)36.6 ± 23.932.9 ± 9.745.2 ± 16.8Ketone (mg/dl)1.30 ± 0.302.00 ± 0.411.47 ± 0.25Lactate (mM)1.72 ± 0.452.05 ± 0.481.13 ± 0.18 Open table in a new tab Table I also shows that there were no significant changes in circulating triglycerides, free fatty acids, ketones, or lactate in either group of STZ-injected animals (AdCMV-βGAL/uninjected or AdCMV-GMΔC-injected), relative to control rats that did not receive STZ. We presume that the absence of an increase in circulating lipids or ketones in the STZ-treated groups is attributable to our use of a single moderate dose of the drug that allows some residual insulin production. In sum, lowering of blood glucose by hepatic GMΔC expression does not perturb other indices of lipid or carbohydrate homeostasis measured in this study.Normalization of Food Intake by Hepatic Expression of GMΔC Occurs by a Leptin-independent Mechanism—During routine monitoring of food consumption during these studies, we observed a potent effect of GMΔC expression on this variable. Many groups have previously reported increased food intake in response to STZ injection and type 1 diabetes, and consistent with this, our STZ-injected rats consumed 42% more food on a daily basis than uninjected controls (Fig. 3). Remarkably, injection of AdCMV-GMΔC into STZ-treated rats caused food consumption to return to normal (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Expression of GMΔC in liver of STZ-injected rats normalizes food intake. The same animals as described in the legend to Fig. 2A were used for measurement of food intake. Animals received either a single bolus of 60 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ-injected) or no streptozotocin injection (No STZ). One group of STZ-injected rats was treated with AdCMV-βGAL adenovirus or received no viral treatment (AdCMV-βGAL/no virus). A separate group of STZ-injected rats received the AdCMV-GMΔC virus. Food intake was measured during three successive 24-h periods, beginning 3 days day after viral treatment. Data represent the mean intake/24 h ± S.E. for eight animals in each STZ-treated group and six in the “no STZ” group. *, STZ-injected rats had increased food intake relative to noninjected controls, with p < 0.001. #, AdCMV-GMΔC-treated, STZ-injected rats had reduced food intake relative to STZ-injected control rats, with p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The hormone leptin plays a major role in control of food intake and feeding behavior. We therefore investigated whether the reduction in food intake in GMΔC-expressing animals was secondary to changes in circulating leptin levels. As shown in Fig. 4, STZ injection caused leptin levels to decrease by 82 and 70% in the AdCMV-βGAL-treated/untreated and AdCMV-GMΔC-treated groups, respectively. On average, leptin levels were slightly but significantly higher in AdCMV-GMΔC-injected animals than in the control STZ-treated rats (p < 0.01). It is unclear whether this slight increase in leptin in the former animals is of any functional significance. In fact, within a subset of several AdCMV-GMΔC (n = 4) or control (n = 3) STZ-treated-animals with no significant differences in their plasma leptin levels (0.70 ± 0.15 versus 0.74 ± 0.01 ng/ml in GMΔC-expressing versus control animals, respectively), food intake was still dramatically reduced in the GMΔC-expressing animals relative to controls (86 ± 4.8 versus 126 ± 2.5 mg/g/day, respectively). Furthermore, work from another laboratory shows that STZ treatment does not influence leptin sensitivity in rats (17Sindelar D.K. Havel P.J. Seeley R.J. Wilkinson C.W. Woods S.C. Schwartz M.W. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1275-1280Google Scholar). In sum, whereas we consider it unlikely that leptin makes a significant contribution to the complete normalization of food intake in the STZ-injected, AdCMV-GMΔC-treated rats, some contribution of the hormone cannot be rigorously excluded at the present time.Fig. 4Circulating leptin levels in STZ-injected rats. The animal treatment groups and their labeling are as described in the legend to Fig. 3. Plasma leptin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay 6 days after viral injection. Data represent the mean ± S.E. for eight animals in each STZ-injected group and six animals in the “no STZ” group. *, both the STZ-injected, AdCMV-GMΔC and STZ-injected control groups had leptin levels lower than the no STZ group, with p < 0.02. #, leptin levels were higher in the STZ-injected, AdCMV-GMΔC-treated rats than in the STZ-injected control group, with p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Another possible explanation for the decline in food intake in AdCMV-GMΔC-treated rats could be that the lowering of blood glucose in these animals prevented spilling of calories in the form of glucose in the urine, thus avoiding the need for compensatory hyperphagia. To test this idea, we measured urine volume and glucose concentration in a separate group of STZ-injected rats with and without GMΔC expression. Animals treated with STZ and AdCMV-GMΔC had blood glucose levels of 316 ± 50 mg/dl immediately prior to and 172 ± 67 mg/dl 6 days after viral injection (n = 3). Control animals not injected with AdCMV-GMΔC had blood glucose levels of 320 ± 54 and 317 ± 44 mg/dl at the same time points (n = 8). As measured in the 24-h period between the fifth and sixth day after AdCMV-GMΔC injection, total urine volume and urine glucose dropped from 78 to 27 ml and from 7.6 g of glucose/24 h to 0.9 g of glucose/24 h, respectively, in response to hepatic GMΔC expression. For comparison, animals that did not receive an injection of STZ had blood glucose levels of 120 mg/dl and no detectable glucose in their urine and produced 18 ml of urine/day (n = 7). The difference in glucose spilling in the untreated versus AdCMV-GMΔC-treated STZ-injected animals of 6.7 g of glucose/24 h (7.6–0.9 g) is equivalent to a loss of 26 kcal/day. This is nearly exactly matched by the reduction in food intake of 25 kcal/day in GMΔC expressing STZ-injected rats versus controls. Thus, the reversal of caloric spilling in the urine is accounted for by a compensatory reduction in food intake in STZ-treated rats with hepatic expression of GMΔC.Expression of GMΔC in Liver of STZ-treated Rats Restores Glycogen Levels to Normal—Hepatic glycogen metabolism is impaired in all forms of diabetes (18Magnusson I.

https://openalex.org/W1976282545,"Complexes formed between DNA polymerase and genomic DNA at the replication fork are key elements of the replication machinery. We used sedimentation velocity, fluorescence anisotropy, and surface plasmon resonance to measure the binding interactions between bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase (gp43) and various model DNA constructs. These results provide quantitative insight into how this replication polymerase performs template-directed 5′ → 3′ DNA synthesis and how this function is coordinated with the activities of the other proteins of the replication complex. We find that short (single- and double-stranded) DNA molecules bind a single gp43 polymerase in a nonspecific (overlap) binding mode with moderate affinity (K d ∼150 nm) and a binding site size of ∼10 nucleotides for single-stranded DNA and ∼13 bp for double-stranded DNA. In contrast, gp43 binds in a site-specific (nonoverlap) mode and significantly more tightly (K d ∼5 nm) to DNA constructs carrying a primer-template junction, with the polymerase covering ∼5 nucleotides downstream and ∼6–7 bp upstream of the 3′-primer terminus. The rate of this specific binding interaction is close to diffusion-controlled. The affinity of gp43 for the primer-template junction is modulated specifically by dNTP substrates, with the next “correct” dNTP strengthening the interaction and an incorrect dNTP weakening the observed binding. These results are discussed in terms of the individual steps of the polymerase-catalyzed single nucleotide addition cycle and the replication complex assembly process. We suggest that changes in the kinetics and thermodynamics of these steps by auxiliary replication proteins constitute a basic mechanism for protein coupling within the replication complex.

We find that short (single- and double-stranded) DNA molecules bind a single gp43 polymerase in a nonspecific (overlap) binding mode with moderate affinity (K d ∼150 nm) and a binding site size of ∼10 nucleotides for single-stranded DNA and ∼13 bp for double-stranded DNA. In contrast, gp43 binds in a site-specific (nonoverlap) mode and significantly more tightly (K d ∼5 nm) to DNA constructs carrying a primer-template junction, with the polymerase covering ∼5 nucleotides downstream and ∼6–7 bp upstream of the 3′-primer terminus. The rate of this specific binding interaction is close to diffusion-controlled. The affinity of gp43 for the primer-template junction is modulated specifically by dNTP substrates, with the next “correct” dNTP strengthening the interaction and an incorrect dNTP weakening the observed binding. These results are discussed in terms of the individual steps of the polymerase-catalyzed single nucleotide addition cycle and the replication complex assembly process. We suggest that changes in the kinetics and thermodynamics of these steps by auxiliary replication proteins constitute a basic mechanism for protein coupling within the replication complex. Major cellular processes, such as DNA replication, DNA transcription, RNA translation, and protein degradation, are carried out by multiprotein assemblies (sometimes called macromolecular machines) (1Alberts B. Cell. 1998; 92: 291-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar), within which the constituent proteins act in a coordinated manner to perform the specific functions of the complex at issue. Furthermore, these protein machines interact within the cell and are functionally coupled to additional complexes. For example, in eukaryotes, the transcription machinery is coupled to the RNA processing complex (or spliceosome), which is itself coupled to the nuclear mRNA export system (2Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Similarly, the rescue of a stalled DNA replication fork by recombination proteins illustrates the functional interactions that occur between the DNA replication, recombination, and repair assemblies (3McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). As a consequence, a coordination or coupling of protein activities exists, not only within a given multiprotein complex, but also between such complexes within the cell. Attaining a molecular understanding of this protein-protein coupling requires characterization of the activities and structures of the proteins as they function in isolation and also as they operate in the presence of one or more protein and/or nucleic acid interaction partners.The DNA replication machinery is a model of a multiprotein complex that must function correctly to ensure the viability of any living organism. The DNA replication machinery of bacteriophage T4 is entirely encoded by the phage itself and requires only eight proteins to catalyze coordinated leading and lagging strand synthesis in vitro, at a rate and with a processivity and fidelity comparable with the same parameters measured in vivo (for reviews see Refs. 4Young M.C. Reddy M.K. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8675-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 5Nossal N.G. Faseb J. 1992; 6: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Benkovic S.J. Valentine A.M. Salinas F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Depending on the stage of phage infection, phage T4 DNA replication is initiated at either an R-loop or at a D-loop, on which the replication proteins involved in initiation assemble. The T4 (gp41) replication helicase (7Venkatesan M. Silver L.L. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12426-12434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Richardson R.W. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4725-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) binds to the single-stranded part of the R-loop or D-loop. When the single-stranded DNA portion of the D-loop is covered by T4-coded single-stranded DNA-binding protein (gp32), assembly of the helicase onto the complex requires the action of gp59 (the T4-coded helicase loading protein), which functions to displace the gp32 protein from the ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s); p-t, primer-template; DTT, dithiothreitol; ddG, dideoxyguanine; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; SSB, single-stranded binding protein.1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; nt, nucleotide(s); p-t, primer-template; DTT, dithiothreitol; ddG, dideoxyguanine; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; SSB, single-stranded binding protein. and thus create a binding site for the helicase.The T4-coded helicase is an A/GTPase (9Liu C.C. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2813-2820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and forms a hexamer upon activation by A/GTP binding (10Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7462-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This hexamer, which comprises the functional form of the gp41 T4 helicase, can, in isolation, use its single-stranded DNA-stimulated A/GTPase activity to translocate along ssDNA templates with a 5′ → 3′ polarity and with moderate processivity (7Venkatesan M. Silver L.L. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12426-12434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Richardson R.W. Nossal N.G. J. Biol.

Schultz D.E. Ring D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1447-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This hexameric helicase, working within the replication complex, unwinds the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) of the genome downstream of the fork, probably (by analogy to the helicase of bacteriophage T7 (12Yu X. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Egelman E.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar)) by working as a ring that encircles the lagging DNA template strand and binds to the leading template strand (8Richardson R.W. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4725-4731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence of its strand-separating activity, the helicase provides two ssDNA templates, called the leading and the lagging DNA strands, to the replication polymerases located behind the fork.The single-stranded sequence of the leading strand template that is exposed by the helicase is immediately “copied” by gp43 (the T4-coded DNA polymerase). The gp43 bound to the primer-template junction at the R- or D-loop extends the nascent DNA, using the newly exposed leading DNA strand as a template. In the absence of DNA and at free protein concentrations comparable with those achieved during phage infection, the gp43 core enzyme in isolation exists as a monomer (13Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4459-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29559-29566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and functions with very limited processivity to incorporate nucleotide residues (nt) into the nascent DNA at physiological salt concentrations. It gains the processivity required for genome replication by interacting with gp45 (the T4-coded sliding processivity clamp), which is loaded at the p-t junction by gp44/62 (the T4-coded processivity clamp-loading complex), resulting in a closed, ring-shaped gp45 trimer that fits loosely around the dsDNA of the genome (15Alley S.C. Shier V.K. Abel-Santos E. Sexton D.J. Soumillion P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7696-7709Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).The gp45 clamp is loaded onto the DNA at a p-t junction by the gp44/62 complex in an ATP-driven reaction, and multiple conformational changes occur in these protein complexes during the loading process (16Pietroni P. Young M.C. Latham G.J. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 869-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Whereas the ssDNA of the leading strand that is exposed by the helicase is immediately used as a template by the leading strand DNA polymerase and is thus stabilized as dsDNA, the ssDNA of the lagging strand template generated behind the helicase is covered (and protected) by gp32 before being copied by the lagging strand polymerase. gp32 binds cooperatively to ssDNA (17Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and removes secondary DNA structures that might inhibit DNA synthesis, leading to a stimulation of the polymerase activity of gp43 (18Huberman J.A. Kornberg A. Alberts B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 62: 39-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Both the leading strand DNA polymerase and the gp32 protein serve to hold the DNA of the replication fork “open” by preventing the reannealing of the two ssDNA strands unwound by the helicase and have thus been defined as molecular “reporters” of helicase function (19Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2003; 36: 1-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Contrary to leading strand-directed DNA synthesis, which is continuous, DNA synthesis on the lagging strand is discontinuous and requires a primase. The T4 primase (gp61) produces small RNA oligomers that bind to the lagging strand template and are then elongated into Okazaki fragments by the lagging strand polymerase. The monomeric gp61 primase interacts with the hexameric gp41 helicase at the fork and acts as an RNA polymerase to synthesize RNA pentamers of specific sequence (20Liu C.C. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5698-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Liu C.C. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2821-2829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Cha T.A.

Contrary to the Escherichia coli primase, which is recruited from solution each time synthesis of an Okazaki fragment is initiated (25Wu C.A. Zechner E.L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4030-4044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the gp61 primase remains associated with the T4 helicase and the DNA replication complex throughout the lagging strand synthesis cycle (14Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29559-29566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This gp41-gp61 interaction guarantees that RNA primers are synthesized at the fork. Little is known about the regulation of gp61 priming activity, but the end result is that the lagging strand RNA primers are properly placed within the moving replication fork, as required to initiate discontinuous lagging strand DNA synthesis. gp32 protein has also been shown to be essential for confining RNA primer synthesis to sites used to start an Okazaki fragment, thus avoiding the synthesis of excess replication primers (26Cha T.A. Alberts B.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1791-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).As outlined above, the assembly of the replication proteins at the fork and the movement of the assembled replication complex along the DNA while performing its task of synthesizing DNA requires highly coordinated and concerted “cross-talk” between the individual components of this multiprotein complex. For example, the DNA polymerase that carries the basic 5′ → 3′ synthesis activity is functionally coupled at the fork to almost all of the other T4 DNA replication proteins, including the helicase, the sliding clamp, and the SSB proteins. This functional coupling leads to a gain in processivity and DNA synthesis rate (see, for example, Refs. 13Delagoutte E. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4459-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 27Schrock R.D. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16678-16682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and also influences the fidelity of the polymerase (28Kunkel T.A. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6830-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Kroutil L.C. Frey M.W. Kaboord B.F. Kunkel T.A. Benkovic S.J. J. Mol.

Genetics. 2002; 162: 1003-1018PubMed Google Scholar).In order to define the molecular bases of the various coupling interactions in which the DNA polymerase participates during replication, we have undertaken an in depth characterization of the complexes formed between the polymerase and the DNA to which it binds during the templated single nucleotide addition (and editing) cycle and during its search for the replication origin. To this end, we have measured the binding of the replication polymerase to several model DNAs, including single-stranded, double-stranded, and primer-template junction-containing DNA molecules. These interactions have been characterized thermodynamically by measuring the dissociation constant (K d) and the binding stoichiometry of the complex and the binding site size of the polymerase on the DNA and kinetically by measuring the rate constants for the association and dissociation of the complex. We have also analyzed the effects of the addition of dNTPs on the affinity of the T4 polymerase for specific p-t junction constructs and ssDNA molecules. These studies allow us to gain further insight into the specific role of the DNA as an assembly platform for the replication complex and also to further define the steps of the single nucleotide addition cycle that are catalyzed by the DNA polymerase. They have also helped us identify the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of the basic DNA polymerase-DNA equilibrium that can be regulated by the various polymerase-coupled replication proteins, since these interactions underlie the function of the replication complex. We propose that the kinetic and thermodynamic modulation of the DNA polymerase-DNA equilibrium by auxiliary replication proteins constitutes a basic mechanism for protein coupling within the replication complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Buffers—All chemicals used in these studies were of analytical reagent grade. Buffers were filtered, degassed, and temperature-equilibrated before use. Dideoxy-GTP was purchased from Invitrogen. dATP and dGTP triphosphate were from Amersham Biosciences. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from New England Biolabs.Protein Purification and Characterization—We used a T4 polymerase mutant deficient in 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity (gp43exo–) in these studies in order to avoid degradation of the DNA substrates during binding measurements. In this gp43 mutant, the aspartic acid residue at position 219 has been changed to alanine (Asp219 provides one of the four essential carboxylate residues for the two-metal ion exonuclease reaction). T4 gp43exo– was purified and stored as described elsewhere (31Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. Hobbs L.J. Spacciapoli P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 560-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of the mutant polymerase were judged to be >95% pure on the basis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Polymerase concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 280 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 1.3 × 105m–1 cm–1 for monomeric gp43exo–. All polymerase concentrations are reported in units of protein monomers.Oligonucleotides and DNA Substrates—All of the oligonucleotides utilized in this study were purchased from Oligos Etc. and were purified on a 15% polyacrylamide sequencing gel before use. The sequences of the DNA oligomers that were used in this study are shown in Table I. The fluorescein derivative used (by Oligos Etc.) to label the oligonucleotides for our fluorescence anisotropy studies was 5′-fluorescein phosphoramidite, which was prepared from 6-carboxyfluorescein. The various DNA p-t junction constructs were formed and “annealed” by heating the primer and template strands to 90 °C for 2 min and then slow cooling to room temperature over a period of ∼2 h. Primer and template strands were used in a 1:1 molar ratio, and the annealing buffer contained 50 mm Tris-OAc (pH 7.5), 100 mm KOAc, and 5 mm Mg(OAc)2. The p-t constructs were purified by electrophoresis on a 12% acrylamide native gel (30:0.8 = acrylamide/bisacrylamide weight ratio). Elution from the gel was performed for 16 h at 50 °C in TBE buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm borate, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 7 m urea. Sep-Pack light tC18 cartridges (Waters) were used to desalt and recover the p-t DNA constructs.Table ISequences of the DNA oligonucleotides usedOligonucleotideSequence12-mer ssDNA5′-XTCTTGTTATCCG-3′16-16-mer dsDNA5′-GTCAGCGGATAACAAG-3′3′-CAGTCGCCTATTGTTCX-5′15-16-mer p-t DNA5′-GTCAGCGGATAACAA-3′3′-CAGTCGCCTATTGTTCX-5′16-18-mer p-t DNA5′-GTCAGCGGATAACAAG-3′3′-CAGTCGCCTATTGTTCTTX-5′15-18-mer p-t DNA5′-GTCAGCGGATAACAA-3′3′-CAGTCGCCTATTGTTCTTX-5′16-20-mer p-t DNA5′-GTCAGCGGATAACAAG-3′3′-CAGTCGCCTATTGTTCTTTTX-5′15-23-mer p-t DNA5′-GTCAGCGGATAACAA-3′3′-CAGTCGCCTATTGTTCTTTTGTTX-5′25-30-mer p-t DNA5′-XGTTTCCTGTGTGAAATTGTTATCCG-3′3′-CAAAGGACACACTTTAACAATAGGCGAGTG-5′a X corresponds to a 6-carboxyfluorescein terminal adduct. Open table in a new tab The primer was reannealed to the template by heating at 90 °C for 2 min and then slow cooling in buffer A (30 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 160 mm KOAc, 0.05 mm EDTA). A version of the 16–20 p-t construct that contained a dideoxyguanine (ddG) residue at the 3′-end of the 16-mer primer was made by extending the 3′-end of the 15-mer of a purified 15–20-mer construct of the same sequence by one residue by incubating a 6 μm concentration of the 15–20-mer construct with 500 μm dideoxy-GTP and 640 nm gp43exo– for 30 min at room temperature. Under these conditions, more than 90% of the 15-mer strand was converted into a 16-mer. The DNA was then precipitated and resuspended in buffer A. The purity of the p-t constructs was determined by radiolabeling the primer strand of the final product and comparing its mobility on a native gel to that of the single-stranded primer strand as well as by monitoring (by fluorescence) the mobility of the template strand of the final product in a native gel. Gels were scanned using either the Phosphor Screen or the blue fluorescence/chemifluorescence mode of the Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated with the ImageQuant software, version 5.1, from Amersham Biosciences. This assay showed the p-t junction DNA constructs to be >90% pure.Polymerase Assay—Assays monitoring DNA synthesis were performed in a buffer containing 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 60 mm KOAc, 6 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 5 mm DTT. 400 nm DNA polymerase was preincubated for 3 min at 30 °C with 400 nm 25–30 construct, 1 μm gp44/62, 350 nm gp45 (trimer), and 6 mm ATP. We note that in order to maintain processivity, these assays included the gp45 processivity clamp and the gp44/62 clamp loader at the concentrations indicated, as well as ATP to drive the clamp loading process (see Refs. 16Pietroni P. Young M.C. Latham G.J. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 869-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar and 32Reddy M.K. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14157-14166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for complete descriptions of the polymerase assay as well as the preparation and properties of the clamp and clamp loader). Single turnover elongation reactions were started by adding an equal volume of a prewarmed mixture containing the four canonical dNTPs (each at a final concentration of 250 μm) and 0.02 mg/ml (final concentration) of heparin. The reaction was quenched after 30 s by adding an equal volume of a formamide/dye mixture (90% deionized formamide, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, 20 mm EDTA). The samples were then boiled, chilled, and loaded on a sequencing gel (12% acrylamide, 19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide). After electrophoresis, the gel was scanned using the blue fluorescence/chemifluorescence mode of the Storm 860 PhosphorImager.The DNA elongation reaction in the presence of heparin was run to check the activity of the purified gp43exo– polymerase. Heparin has been shown to prevent “multiple-hit” extension of DNA primers by binding the polymerase that dissociates from the p-t junction after the reaction has been initiated (32Reddy M.K. Weitzel S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14157-14166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We show that a heparin concentration of 0.02 mg/ml is sufficient to trap 200 nm DNA polymerase (Fig. 1, lane 1). Furthermore, >90% of a 200 nm concentration of 25–30-mer p-t construct (see Table I) could be extended under single turnover conditions by an equivalent concentration of gp43exo– (Fig. 1, lane 2). Thus, our gp43exo– polymerase preparation is at least 90% active.Preparation of Samples for Velocity Sedimentation and Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—The buffer used in the velocity sedimentation experiments contained 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm KOAc, 50 μm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT, whereas the buffer used in the surface plasmon resonance experiments contained 25 mm Hepes, 160 mm NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20. For both sets of experiments, the proteins were dialyzed against 0.5 liters of the above buffer for 2 h at 4 °C, using a Spectra/Por 16-well microdialyzer apparatus (Spectrum) containing a 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Spectra/Por CE dialysis membrane. The microdialyzer apparatus was connected to a pump with the flow rate set at 7 ml/min. Samples with volumes of 30–60 μl were loaded into each well. After dialysis, samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were saved. The protein concentrations of the supernatant solutions were measured using UV absorbance at 280 nm. From 85 to 100% of the input protein was recovered after dialysis. The recovered proteins were then diluted to the desired final concentrations with the above buffers.Velocity Sedimentation Experiments—Analytical sedimentation velocity runs were performed in the Beckman Optima XL-I Analytical Ultracentrifuge. The sample and reference sectors of scrupulously cleaned 1.2-cm path length double-sector ultracentrifuge cells equipped with either aluminum or Epon aluminum-filled centerpieces and quartz windows were filled with 400- and 420-μl volumes of protein (and/or DNA) and buffer, respectively. The p-t junction DNA sample (containing ∼80% p-t junction and ∼20% 20-mer ssDNA) used in this study was a 16–20-mer with a dG residue at the 3′-end of the primer. The cells were loaded into an An60Ti analytical ultracentrifuge rotor. Centrifugation was started when the preset experimental temperature (20 °C) had been reached. Experiments were performed at a rotor speed of 60,000 rpm, and absorbance scans at 280 nm and/or 260 nm were collected at intervals of 2.5–8 min. (The 280-nm scans were used to follow the sedimentation of the protein component of the complexes, whereas the 260-nm scans tracked primarily the sedimentation of the DNA components.)The van Holde-Weischet method (33van Holde K.E.

The software for the van Holde-Weischet method was included in the UltraScan version 5.0 for Linux provided by Borries Demeler and downloaded from the World Wide Web at www.ultrascan.uthscsa.edu. The DCDT+ version 1.16 used to compute g*(s) was purchased from John Philo and downloaded from the World Wide Web at www.jphilo.mailway.com/. The Sedfit program, which fits the sedimentation boundaries using numerical solutions of the Lamm equation, was downloaded from the World Wide Web at www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com/. The partial specific volume (|ν) for the gp43exo– polymerase (0.7362 ml/g) as well as the buffer density (1.015 g/ml) and viscosity (0.010234 poise) were calculated using the sedimentation interpretation program, Sednterp (version 1.07), which was downloaded from the World Wide Web at www.bbri.org/RASMB/rasmb.html/. A value of |ν = 0.5 ml/gm was used for all of the DNA components, and |ν values of 0.722 ml/g and 0.715 ml/g were for the polymerase-12-mer DNA and the polymerase-16–20-mer p-t construct, respectively. These latter values were calculated for the nucleoprotein complexes by “molecular weight averaging.” Only runs analyzed using the Sedfit software are shown in the figures. The sedimentation coefficient of gp43 DNA polymerase measured by sedimentation velocity was compared with that of the highly related RB69 DNA polymerase calculated from the atomic level structure (36Wang J.

HYDROPRO was downloaded from the World Wide Web at leonardo.fcu.um.es/macromol.Fluorescence Anisotropy Experiments—Fluorescence anisotropy data were acquired using a SLM model 8000 spectrofluorimeter (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL). Samples were excited at a wavelength of 492 nm, and emission was monitored at 516 nm. All experiments were performed with a 440-μl cuvette and at a constant temperature of 20 °C in 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 160 mm KOAc, 50 μm EDTA, 1 mm DTT buffer. When present, the final concentration of added dNTP was 250 μm.Surface Plasmon Resonance Experiments—SPR data were collected on a Biacore X Instrument from Biosensor Amersham Biosciences. All experiments were conducted at 16 °C. The p-t junction sample used in this study was the 16–20-mer p-t DNA construct carrying a dG residue at the 3′-end of the primer (see Table I), and the 20-mer DNA strand was biotinylated at its 5′-end. The Sensor SA chip was prepared as recommended by the manufacturer, and ∼12 response units (RUs) of the 16–20-mer p-t construct were immobilized on the chip. To measure the association rate of the polymerase to the 16–20-mer p-t construct, the diluted protein was injected for a period of 1 min. The dissociation reaction was monitored for 20 s. The flow rate used during both the association and the dissociation phases of the reaction was 50 μl/min. The regeneration buffer contained 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 m NaCl, 50 μm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P20.RESULTSBinding of T4 DNA Polymerase to Nonspecific (Single- and Double-stranded) DNA—The binding of the DNA polymerase to nonspecific DNA was measured using the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy assay.

Based on homology modeling to the crystal structure of the glutamate binding site of the 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)-propionic acid receptor GluR2, cysteines were introduced into the NR1 subunit as chemical sensors for three thiol-reactive derivatives of the competitive antagonist L-701,324. After coexpressing the mutant NR1 with wild-type NR2B subunits in Xenopus oocytes, agonist-induced currents were recorded to monitor irreversible receptor inactivation by the reactive antagonists. For each derivative, glycine site-specific inactivations were observed with a distinct subset of cysteine-substituted receptors. Together these inactivating substitutions identified seven NR1 residues (Ile-385, Gln-387, Glu-388, Thr-500, Asn-502, Ala-696, and Val-717) that undergo proximity-induced covalent coupling with specific regions of the bound antagonist and disclose its mode of docking in the glycine binding pocket of the NMDA receptor.

Dani J.A. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 501-506Google Scholar, 2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61Google Scholar). It requires both glutamate and the co-agonist glycine for efficient channel gating (3Johnson J.W. Ascher P. Nature. 1987; 325: 529-531Google Scholar, 4Kleckner N.W. Dingledine R. Science. 1988; 241: 835-837Google Scholar) and is composed of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits, each (5Laube B. Kuhse J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2954-2961Google Scholar). The NR1 subunit binds glycine with submicromolar affinity, whereas the NR2 subunit harbors the glutamate binding site (6Grimwood S. Lebourdelles B. Whiting P.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 525-530Google Scholar, 7Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Google Scholar). Various splice variants of the NR1 subunit and four isoforms of the NR2 subunit (A–D) generate different subtypes of tetrameric NMDA receptors, which differ in their pharmacologies (8Laurie D.J. Seeburg P.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharm. 1994; 268: 335-345Google Scholar) and expression patterns (9Buller A.L. Larson H.C. Beaton J.A. Morrisett R.A. Monaghan D.T. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5471-5484Google Scholar, 10Watanabe M. Inoue Y. Sakimura K. Mishina M. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 1138-1140Google Scholar).NMDA receptors are crucially implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory formation as well as in many neurological and psychiatric disorders (11Meldrum B. Garthwaite J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 379-387Google Scholar). Classic NMDA receptor antagonists have therefore been examined for their therapeutic potential; in most cases, however, severe side-effects (reviewed by Kornhuber and Weller, Ref. 12Kornhuber J. Weller M. Biol. Psychiatry. 1997; 41: 135-144Google Scholar), have prevented their clinical use. An alternative strategy focuses on glycine site antagonists that display considerable subtype selectivity (13Danysz W. Parsons C.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 597-664Google Scholar). Structure-activity studies have defined a pharmacophore that delineates different ligand interactions within the glycine binding site of NMDA receptors (reviewed in Ref. 14Leeson P.D. Iversen L.L. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 4053-4067Google Scholar). However, the structure of this site and the amino acid residues responsible for these interactions have only been deduced by indirect approaches.Mutational analysis has revealed residues whose substitution reduces the efficacies of glycine site agonists and antagonists (15Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Google Scholar, 16Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Google Scholar, 17Wafford K.A.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 701-708Google Scholar, 19Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3532-3537Google Scholar). Notably, these residues are located within ∼200 positions N-terminal to the first putative transmembrane domain (segment S1) and on the loop that links the second and third transmembrane regions (segment S2) of the NR1 subunit. Both segments show significant homology to bacterial periplasmic amino acid binding proteins and are thought to bind ligand by a Venus fly-trap mechanism (15Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Google Scholar, 16Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Google Scholar, 20Uchino S. Nakajima-lijima S. Okuda K. Mishina M. Kawamoto S. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 445-449Google Scholar). Consistent with a structural model based on this homology (7Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Google Scholar), a soluble fusion protein containing the S1 and S2 segments of the NR1 sequence displayed binding properties similar to those of the native NMDA receptor (21Ivanovic A. Reilander H. Laube B. Kuhse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19933-19937Google Scholar). Furthermore, the high-affinity antagonist 7-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-(3-phenoxyphenyl)quinolin-2(1H)-one (L-701,324) (22Kulagowski J.J. Baker R. Curtis N.R. Leeson P.D. Mawer I.M. Moseley A.M. Ridgill M.P. Rowley M. Stansfield I. Foster A.C. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1402-1405Google Scholar, 23Grimwood S. Kulagowski J.J. Mawer L.M. Rowley M. Leeson P.D. Foster A.C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 290: 221-226Google Scholar) could be efficiently docked into the modeled binding site (7Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Google Scholar).Here, we have used engineered chemical coupling reactions between reactive antagonists and distinct cysteine substitutions (24Perret P. Sarda X. Wolff M. Bushey D. Goeldner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25350-25354Google Scholar, 25Foucaud B. Perret P. Grutter T. Goeldner M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 170-173Google Scholar) to identify residues of the NR1 subunit that are in close vicinity of the bound antagonist. This approach extends the substituted cysteine accessibility method (26Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-155Google Scholar) by using site-specific cysteine-reactive compounds. The reactive ligands, derived from L-701,324 (Fig. 1), have been described previously (27Kreimeyer A. Laube B. Sturgess M. Goeldner M. Foucaud B. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4394-4404Google Scholar). NR1 subunit positions substituted into cysteines were selected using an improved three-dimensional model of the glycine binding site generated by homology modeling to the crystal structure of the GluR2 “S1-S2” fusion protein (28Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Google Scholar). We show that the orientation of antagonists in the receptor binding pocket can be unequivocally established by monitoring the inactivation of different cysteine-mutants with the reactive L-701,324 derivatives.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Modeling—Sequence alignments between the S1 and S2 segments of NR1 and the homologous regions of the NR2B subunit and of the (S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor GluR2, as well as the atomic coordinates of GluR2 (PDB access code 1GR2) used as template for homology modeling, were taken from Armstrong et al. (28Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Google Scholar). Molecular modeling and graphical manipulations were performed using the SYBYL 6.7 program (Tripos Associates, St. Louis, MO). The C-α framework of NR1 was constructed on GluR2 by treating structurally conserved regions as invariant. The secondary structures of the remaining fragments, especially the loops, were extracted computationally from the SYBYL protein data base, as described in Ref. 29Wittekindt B. Malany S. Schemm R. Otvos L. Maccecchini M.L. Laube B. Betz H. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 41: 753-761Google Scholar. L-701,324 was built from Cambridge fragments using the SYBYL program, docked manually by DOCK, and then computationally by FLEXIDOCK. The resulting complex was energy-minimized in the absence of solvent (Tripos force field, Kollmann-all-atom charges).Site-directed Mutagenesis and Oocyte Expression—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the NR1 subunit cDNA (30Moriyoshi K. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 354: 31-37Google Scholar) was performed as described (16Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Google Scholar), using the PCR-based QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); all mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. Linearized plasmid DNAs were used for the in vitro synthesis of cRNAs of the rat NR1 and of the mouse NR2B subunits using T7 and T3 RNA polymerase, respectively (15Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Google Scholar, 16Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Google Scholar). Mixtures of the NR1 and NR2B cRNAs (1:3 ratio) were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, and agonist-induced responses were recorded under voltage-clamp conditions as detailed previously (7Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Google Scholar, 16Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Google Scholar). Glycine dose-response curves were determined for all cysteine mutants that were inactivated by our affinity probes (see below), using a glutamate concentration of 100 μm. EC50 values for glycine were calculated as described (15Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Google Scholar).Inactivation Experiments—The protocol for irreversible receptor inactivation was adapted from Perret et al. (24Perret P. Sarda X. Wolff M. Bushey D. Goeldner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25350-25354Google Scholar). Oocytes displaying a reproducible and stable response to agonists were incubated in drug-containing frog Ringer's solution (FR) for either 15 min with 7-isothiocyanate-4-hydroxy-3-(3-phenoxyphenyl)quinolin-2(1H)-one (7-NCS) and 7-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-(isothiocyanatophenyl)quinolin-2(1H)-one (m1-NCS), or for 20 min with 2-chloro-N-[4-hydroxy-3-(phenoxyphenyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-7yl]acetamide (7-CAA) in the recording chamber. Stock solutions (2.75 mm for 7-NCS and 2 mm for 7-CAA and m1-NCS, respectively) in Me2SO were diluted to 4% (w/v) in FR shortly before incubation with the oocytes (final concentrations 110 and 80 μm, respectively). After incubation, the oocytes were washed for 3 min with FR, for 1 min in 1 mm glycine-containing FR, and again with FR (3 min) before recording the agonist response as detailed above; only stable and reproducible responses were considered. Inactivation experiments were repeated for each mutant-drug combination; a reduction in response >15% was taken as a significant inactivation, because variations between experiments were smaller. The same protocol was applied in protection experiments, in which 1 mm glycine or 10 μm L-701,324 were included during the incubation; under these conditions, the mutant receptors were fully protected from inactivation.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONModel-assisted Design of Cysteine Mutants—The ligand binding segments S1 and S2 of NR1 present in the glycine binding recombinant NR1 fusion protein (21Ivanovic A. Reilander H. Laube B. Kuhse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19933-19937Google Scholar) display a sequence identity of 22% with the glutamate binding domains (S1-S2) of the AMPA receptor (28Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Google Scholar). The polypeptide backbone of the NR1 glycine binding site was therefore modeled after the crystal structure (accession number 1GluR2) of the AMPA receptor binding region (28Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Google Scholar). The resulting model is presented in Fig. 2A. It includes segments S1 and S2 of the NR1 polypeptide, with the same sequence of secondary structure elements (helices, strands, and loops) as in the GluR2 template (28Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Google Scholar). Like in bacterial amino acid binding proteins (31Oh B.H. Pandit J. Kang C.H. Nikaido K. Gokcen S. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11348-11355Google Scholar), segments S1 and S2 form the globular lobes 1 and 2, which are connected by two hinge regions (see also Ref. 7Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Google Scholar). The lobes are separated by a central cleft that provides the ligand binding pocket and is lined by loop regions 385–390, 463–467, 500–505, 694–696, and 714–717. These loops harbor determinants of glycine site pharmacology (15Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Google Scholar, 16Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Google Scholar, 18Williams K. Chao J. Kashiwagi K. Masuko T. Igarashi K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 701-708Google Scholar, 19Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M.A. VanDongen A.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3532-3537Google Scholar, 21Ivanovic A. Reilander H. Laube B. Kuhse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19933-19937Google Scholar). Computational docking of the glycine site antagonist L-701,324 resulted in two possible orientations (Fig. 2B). The first predicted docking mode for L-701,324 resembled that of the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) in the GluR2 S1-S2 crystal, with the 2-carbonyl group of the quinoline ring pointing toward the guanidinium group of Arg-505, and the heterocyclic N-atom toward the backbone carbonyl of Pro-498 (28Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Google Scholar). In the second alternative docking position, L-701,324 was rotated by about 120o, with the chlorine atom at position 7 pointing toward Arg-505 and the phenoxy group at phenyl ring 1 mediating π-cation binding to lysine residues Lys-459 and -667. The loops contacting the antagonist and the energy ΔF predicted to stabilize binding (26 kcal/mole) were the same in both modes of docking.Fig. 2Model of the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor located on the NR1 subunit and computed antagonist docking.A, ligand binding domain. Segment Thr-378-Arg-530 (with a gap between Met-397 and Asn-422; blue) contains helices A to D and strands 1 to 8, as defined by Armstrong et al. (28Armstrong N. Sun Y. Chen G.Q. Gouaux E. Nature. 1998; 395: 913-917Google Scholar); segment Phe-636-Cys-780 (green) encompasses helices E to K and strands 9 to 13. The polypeptide sequence between Arg-530 and Phe-636 comprising the first three membrane segments is not included in the model. The two segments form two lobes, the juxtamembrane lobe 2 (top) and the more external lobe 1 (bottom), which are separated by a central cleft and connected by two hinge segments, Phe-515-Gly-519 and Leu-734-Phe-740. Yellow dots indicate positions selected for point mutation; amino acid numbering does not include the signal peptide. B, two possible modes of docking for L-701,324 in the central cleft, both corresponding to a stabilizing energy ΔF of 26 kcal/mole.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To test which of these orientations is used by L-701,324, we substituted residues Ile-385, Gln-387, Glu-388, Phe-390, Thr-500, Ile-501, Asn-502, Ser-695, Ala-696, Asp-714, and Val-717 of the NR1 subunit by cysteines. All these residues are predicted to contact the reactive antagonists in their different docking orientations (Fig. 2). The substituted NR1 polypeptides were then co-expressed with the wild-type NR2B subunit in Xenopus oocytes, and the resulting receptors were examined for their reactivities toward the cysteine-reactive antagonists by monitoring the recovery of agonist-induced currents after incubation with these reagents.Irreversible Inactivation of Mutant Receptors by Cysteine-reactive Antagonists—The three reactive ligands used in this study, 7-NCS, 7-CAA, and m1-NCS (Fig. 1), were selected out of 12 compounds described previously, on the basis of their high reactivity toward cysteine, their stability in FR solution, and their affinity for wild-type NMDA receptors (27Kreimeyer A. Laube B. Sturgess M. Goeldner M. Foucaud B. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4394-4404Google Scholar): 7-CAA, 7-NCS, and m1-NCS bind reversibly to rat brain membranes with Kis of ∼280, 64, and 48 nm, respectively (27Kreimeyer A. Laube B. Sturgess M. Goeldner M. Foucaud B. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4394-4404Google Scholar), as compared with 14 nm for L-701,324. 7-CAA, 7-NCS, and m1-NCS all have been shown to reversibly and dose-dependently inhibit the glycine binding site of the wild-type NMDA receptor (IC50s in the nano-to micromolar range, Ref. 27Kreimeyer A. Laube B. Sturgess M. Goeldner M. Foucaud B. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4394-4404Google Scholar). Indeed, the agonist responses of Xenopus oocytes injected with wild-type NR1 and NR2B cRNAs (15Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Google Scholar, 16Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Google Scholar) were blocked by >95% upon incubation with saturating concentrations (50 μm) of these reactive antagonists but fully recovered after a 3–5 min washout as reported (27Kreimeyer A. Laube B. Sturgess M. Goeldner M. Foucaud B. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4394-4404Google Scholar). In contrast, when cysteine mutant receptor-expressing Xenopus oocytes were incubated with these ligands under identical conditions, inhibition of agonist-induced currents often could not be reversed upon prolonged washing for up to 20 min with some of the mutants. This is illustrated in Fig. 3. Panel A shows a typical experiment with mutant V717C. Incubation with 7-CAA irreversibly reduced the current by ∼70% (top), indicating that the cysteine residue introduced had reacted with the covalent antagonist; this inhibition of the current response was not observed when L-701,324 was added to 7-CAA during the incubation (bottom). Notably, this irreversible inhibition of the glycine currents frequently displayed high chemical selectivity. For example, in oocytes expressing receptors with the substitution NR1(Q387C) (B) inactivation of the current response depended on the nature of the reactive group in the 7-position of the ligand molecule: only 7-NCS, and not 7-CAA, caused irreversible inhibition. The high specificity of inactivation is further illustrated in panel C, left. Receptors containing the mutation NR1(N502C) were irreversibly inactivated after incubation with m1-NCS, whereas they recovered within about 3 min from reversible antagonism after incubation with 7-NCS. Also, incubating the same mutant receptor with m1-NCS in the presence of 1 mm glycine completely prevented inactivation (panel C, right). Similar protections by agonist were obtained for the other inactivating reactions discussed below (data not shown). These findings indicate that modifications occurred selectively at the substituted positions within the glycine binding site of the NR1 subunit.Fig. 3Electrophysiological demonstration of site-specific and position-selective irreversible receptor inactivation by cysteine-reactive antagonists.A, an oocyte-expressing mutant V717C of NR1 in combination with wild-type NR2B was voltage-clamped at a holding potential of –70 mV at room temperature. Initial responses evoked by the addition of 100 μm glutamate and glycine were recorded repeatedly, with ≥ 3-min wash periods between each agonist application (left). The oocyte was subsequently incubated for 20 min in 110 μm 7-CAA and washed with medium before and after application of 1 mm glycine for 1 min. Agonist responses were then recorded as initially (right). The current response was irreversibly inhibited by ≥ 70% (top line). When, in the same experiment, the oocyte is co-incubated with 110 μm 7-CAA and 10 μm L-701,324, the current response is not decreased (bottom line). B, in a similar experiment, substitution NR1(Q387C) caused an inactivation of > 70% of the current response after incubation with 7-NCS (right), whereas no inactivation was observed after incubation with 7-CAA (left). C, current responses of receptors containing the mutation NR1(N502C) upon incubation with 7-NCS (open bars and circles) and m1-NCS (filled bars and squares). Left, successive responses before and after incubation with the reactive antagonist. Note that the current response recovered after incubation with 7-NCS, whereas inactivation by m1-NCS is irreversible. Right, 1 mm glycine protected the current response from inactivation by m1-NCS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Affinity labeling reactions involve the formation of an irreversible chemical bond and occur within a binary receptor-ligand complex. Thus, the rate of inactivation of a mutant receptor by a reactive ligand depends on the extent of receptor occupancy, i.e. ligand concentration and affinity. Our ligands show a high affinity for wild-type NMDA receptors, as determined under equilibrium binding conditions (27Kreimeyer A. Laube B. Sturgess M. Goeldner M. Foucaud B. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4394-4404Google Scholar). With mutated receptors subject to inactivation by these ligands, precise affinity estimates cannot be obtained. Different lines of evidence, however, indicate that the inactivations observed here reflect covalent bond formation with the mutated position and that they occurred within the ligand binding site: (i) the substantial inactivation of cysteine-substituted but not wild-type receptors seen upon incubation with our reactive ligands is consistent with the newly introduced cysteines constituting the target residues of the reagents; (ii) saturating concentrations of glycine protected the cysteine mutants from inactivation, as predicted for covalent bond formation within the glycine binding site; and (iii) the ligand and receptor concentrations used in our inactivation experiments were far too low to support a bimolecular reaction mechanism. In model reactions (27Kreimeyer A. Laube B. Sturgess M. Goeldner M. Foucaud B. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4394-4404Google Scholar), millimolar concentrations of reactive analogue and of free cysteine were required to observe a reagent half-life of 20 min. We therefore conclude that the receptor-inactivating coupling reactions occurred within the binary receptor-ligand complex.Selectivity of Mutant Receptor Inactivations by Cysteine-reactive Antagonists—A systematic analysis of the inactivation patterns obtained for the 14 cysteine mutants upon incubation with the different reactive antagonists (Fig. 4) revealed that 7-NCS inactivated mutants Q387C, T500C, and A696C but none of the other mutant receptors. In contrast, 7-CAA carrying a different reactive group at the same position as 7-NCS caused strong inactivation of mutants I385C, E388C, T500C, and V717C but not of Q387C and A696C or any of the other mutants tested. Both ligands failed to inactivate substitution F390C, although this residue is located in close vicinity to reactive positions. N502C was the only mutant found to be significantly inactivated out of the six mutants incubated with derivative m1-NCS (Fig. 4). These results highlight the high selectivity of mutant receptor inactivations and are summarized in Table I. We conclude from these data that ligands 7-CAA and 7-NCS react selectively and differentially with cysteine residues introduced into the loop between positions 385 and 390, and, on the opposite side of the central cleft, into loops 695–696 and 714–717. In addition, of the cysteine substitutions in the Thr-500-Asn-502 loop region, T500C but not I501C or N502C were accessible to 7-NCS and 7-CAA, whereas m1-NCS reacted solely with mutant N502C but not with T500C. Finally, we were unable to observe receptor inactivation with the NR1 substitutions Q518C, G519C, and V771C, and therefore these mutants were not further analyzed. In summary, each derivative reacted site-specifically and selectively with cysteines introduced in loops predicted to line the glycine binding pocket in our model.Fig. 4Histogram showing the inactivation patterns obtained for different mutated positions with each of the three reactive ligands. Note marked selectivity of current inactivation; m1-NCS inactivated only mutant N502C, whereas both 7-CAA and 7-NCS reduced the agonist responses of different mutant receptors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IChemical inactivation and glycine binding properties of wild-type and mutant NMDA receptorsReceptor subtypeExtents of inactivationEC50 for glycine7-NCS7-CAAm1-NCSμMR1/R2B---0.81 ± 0.32aFrom Kuryatov et al.

Open table in a new tab Implications for Antagonist Docking in the Glycine Binding Site—The inactivation patterns described above allowed defining the mode of antagonist docking in the modeled glycine binding pocket of the NMDA receptor. All our data are consistent with an antagonist docking position resembling that of CNQX in the glutamate binding pocket of the AMPA receptor GluR2 and exclude the alternative positioning suggested by our molecular simulations. This conclusion is based on the following considerations. First, the covalent antagonists carrying reactive substituents at the 7-position of the quinoline ring system inactivated mutant receptors with cysteine residues at positions 385–390, 500, 696, and 717 (Table I). This broad reactivity pattern can be explained by the reactive groups of both 7-NCS and 7-CAA displaying high rotational mobility, thus allowing alkylation of multiple cysteine-substituted residues by the docked ligand. In addition, the nature of the reactive group, in particular the distance of its electrophilic center from the quinoline ring, was found to critically influence inactivation reactions. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, all target residues mentioned above were predicted to be available to modification by 7-NCS and 7-CAA from the same docking p"

Small differences in the retinoic acid response elements (RARE) may be essential for these distinct responses. Recently, we identified a RARE in a Hox enhancer (dubbed distal element) that is active relatively late during mouse development. We now show that the RARE motif in the distal element is necessary and sufficient for the induction of gene expression by retinoic acid (RA) in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the significance of these results was established by RA treatment of transgenic mouse lines carrying the distal element containing the wild-type or a mutated RARE. We compared the in vitro activity of the distal element-RARE with that of the direct repeat with 5-bp spacer RARE of the RARβ2 gene, which is active during early during mouse development. We found that these RAREs, despite their similarity, responded differently to RA. By making single point mutations we show that the specificity resides in their retinoid X receptor-binding sites and is determined by base pairs located just outside the RARE consensus sequence. We suggest that the context of RARE motifs is important for the distinct transcriptional activities of genes under control of retinoid signaling.

There has been a long-standing debate whether or not RA acts in a gradient and provides in such a way positional information that is needed for the proper patterning of the embryo (4Thaller C. Eichele G. Nature. 1987; 327: 625-628Google Scholar, 5Wanek N. Gardiner D.M. Muneoka K. Bryant S.V. Nature. 1991; 350: 81-83Google Scholar, 6Dupé V. Lumsden A. Development. 2001; 128: 2199-2208Google Scholar). Recently, evidence has been obtained that a graded distribution of RA in the hindbrain is essential for the specification of rhombomere identity (6Dupé V. Lumsden A. Development. 2001; 128: 2199-2208Google Scholar). This process of rhombomere specification requires that distinct downstream gene targets of RA signaling must be able to respond differently to identical levels of retinoids. RA-induced alterations in gene transcription are mediated by nuclear receptors, the RARs (α, β, and γ) and RXRs (α, β, and γ), that act as ligand-responsive transcriptional regulators (reviewed in Ref. 7Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar). RAR/RXR heterodimers bind to DNA through sequence motifs known as retinoic acid response elements (RAREs; Ref. 8Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Google Scholar). Like many other hormone response elements (HREs), the RAREs consist of two half-sites arranged in tandem repeats. The specificity of the HREs for a given nuclear receptor is determined by sequence, spacing, and relative orientation of these half-sites (7Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar, 9Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Google Scholar). RAR/RXR heterodimers bind preferentially to direct repeats with the consensus sequence AGGTCA spaced by 1, 2, or 5 bp (DR1, -2, or -5; Refs. 7Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Google Scholar and 10Kurokawa R. Soderstrom M. Horlein A. Halachmi S. Brown M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 451-454Google Scholar). Although naturally occurring RAREs have been identified that have divergent half-site configurations or sequence, the TCA motif is usually present (11Mader S. Leroy P. Chen J.Y. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 591-600Google Scholar, 12Gould A. Itasaki N. Krumlauf R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 39-51Google Scholar). The binding of RAR/RXR heterodimers to the RAREs is co-operative. It is thought that the RARE motif aligns the RAR and RXR subunits and induces conformational changes that lead to stable interactions within this ternary complex (13Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Google Scholar, 14Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Google Scholar). Moreover, protein binding to one of the half-sites may induce structural distortions in the DNA that facilitate protein binding to the second site (14Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Google Scholar). These co-operative interactions suggest that the heterodimers do not pre-assemble before DNA-binding, but rather assemble on the appropriate RAREs. Beside the interaction in the ternary complex response elements also affect the interactions of the receptors with their ligands and other protein factors important for gene regulation (10Kurokawa R. Soderstrom M. Horlein A. Halachmi S. Brown M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 451-454Google Scholar, 15La Vista-Picard N. Hobbs P.D. Pfahl M. Dawson M.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4137-4146Google Scholar, 16Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Google Scholar). These possible allosteric modifications by the DNA-binding sites may cause a RARE-dependent transcriptional response upon ligand binding (16Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Google Scholar). Transgenic experiments in mice reveal a difference in response of two distinct RAREs present in the Hox cluster. When in the Hoxb4 early neural enhancer the DR5 RARE is replaced by a functional Hoxb1 DR2 RARE, the expression pattern of the reporter construct in the neural tube acquires the features of those of Hoxb1 (12Gould A. Itasaki N. Krumlauf R. Neuron. 1998; 21: 39-51Google Scholar). This experiment suggests that the RARE itself, and not its context, is crucial for the interpretation of the graded RA distribution. Recently we discovered a novel functional DR5 RARE in a late neural enhancer, called the distal element (DE), which is able to mediate the expression of 5′ Hoxb genes (17Oosterveen T. Niederreither K. Dolle P. Chambon P. Meijlink F. Deschamps J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 262-269Google Scholar). This 533-bp DE drives reporter gene expression in a RARβ2-like pattern (17Oosterveen T. Niederreither K. Dolle P. Chambon P. Meijlink F. Deschamps J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 262-269Google Scholar, 18Shen S. van den Brink C.E. Kruijer W. van der Saag P.T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 36: 465-476Google Scholar, 19Ruberte E. Friederich V. Chambon P. Morriss-Kay G. Development. 1993; 118: 267-282Google Scholar). Interestingly, the RARβ2 promoter is under control of a DR5 RARE as well (20De Thé H. Del M.V. Tiolais P. Stunnenberg H. Dejean A. Nature. 1990; 343: 177-180Google Scholar, 21Sucov H.M. Murakami K.K. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5392-5396Google Scholar). Although the late neural expression patterns are the same, the DE is not active in embryos younger than E10.0, whereas the RARβ2 RARE starts to be active between E7.5 and E8.5 (17Oosterveen T. Niederreither K. Dolle P. Chambon P. Meijlink F. Deschamps J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 262-269Google Scholar, 22Rossant J. Zirngibl R. Cado D. Shago M. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1333-1344Google Scholar). The distinct temporal activities of both RAREs could reside in sequence differences in the RARE themselves as both half-sites of the RAREs differ in one base pair from each other. In this study we directly compared the activities of the RARβ2 and DE-RAREs. We demonstrate in P19 embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells and mouse embryos a RA sensitivity of the DE, which depends on the presence of an intact RARE. We found that in P19 cells the DE-RARE is far less sensitive to RA than the RARE of the RARβ2 gene. By comparing 25 bp RARE-containing elements derived from the RARβ2 promoter and the DE, we found that the RXR-binding site and predominantly the direct context of these motifs account for the observed differences. RA Exposure of Embryos in Utero, Whole Mount X-Gal Staining, and in Situ Hybridization—RA administration to pregnant mothers by oral gavage was performed as described (23Conlon R.A. Rossant J. Development. 1992; 116: 357-368Google Scholar). The procedures for the whole mount X-Gal staining and in situ hybridization with a Hoxb5 probe have been described in Ref. 17Oosterveen T. Niederreither K. Dolle P. Chambon P. Meijlink F. Deschamps J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 262-269Google Scholar. All animal experiments were conducted under the approval of the animal care committee of the KNAW (Royal Dutch Academy of Arts and Sciences). DNA Constructs—The basic luciferase reporter construct used was a modification of the p19Luc plasmid (24van Zonneveld A.J. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5525-5529Google Scholar), which is named 19E1bluc and contains a fusion between the TATA box of the E1b promoter and the luciferase gene. Subfragments of the complete DE (25Valarché I. De Graaff W. Deschamps J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1997; 41: 705-714Google Scholar) and their mutated forms were cloned as EcoRV-HincII fragments into the HincII site of p19E1bluc. The subfragments of the DE studied were in most cases inserted in both orientations, but we found no influence of the orientation of these fragments on the activity of the resulting constructs. Therefore we only show the data corresponding to one orientation of the DE and its mutated versions. The DE with mutations in both half-sites was described previously (17Oosterveen T. Niederreither K. Dolle P. Chambon P. Meijlink F. Deschamps J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 262-269Google Scholar), and the mutations made separately in each half-sites were made in a similar way and checked by sequencing. Two copies of the 25-bp elements containing the RARE (see “Results” section for exact sequence) were cloned as EcoRI-SalI fragments in the SalI site of the p19E1bluc vector. These constructs were subjected to sequence analysis for verification. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—Culturing of P19 EC cells and cell transfections and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were cultured as described by Folkers et al. (26Folkers G.B. van der Leede B.J. van der Saag P.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 616-627Google Scholar, 27Folkers G.B. van der Burg B. van der Saag P.T. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 56: 119-129Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Cells were transfected in 24-well plates with 2 μg of luciferase reporter construct and 1 μg of pSV2lacZ. Lysates were prepared with 300 μl of lysis buffer per well for 20 min at 4 °C, and 50 and 25 μl of the lysate was immediately used for the luciferase and β-galactosidase assay, respectively. Results are the mean (±S.D.) of at least three independent experiments of three to four transfections for each construct. Relative induction was obtained by dividing the mean of each reporter construct by the mean of the empty luciferase construct. Percentage induction was calculated by dividing the activity of a particular construct by the sum of activities of all constructs in one experiment. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—The EMSAs were performed as described (28Folkers G.B. van der Burg B. van der Saag P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32200-32212Google Scholar). The sequences of the used oligonucleotides, labeled by filling in a 5′ AGG sticky end, were as follows: β, AGGGTTCACCGAAAGTTCACTCGCA; DE, CGGGATCACGCAGAGGTCA-GCAGAC; DEmut, CGGGCCCACGCAGAGTACTGCAGAC; DE3′m, CGGGATCACGCAGAGTACTGCAGAC; DE5′m, CGGGCCCACGCAGAGTACTGCAGAC. The RARE sequences are shown in bold and the mutations are underlined. Whole cell extracts were obtained from COS-1 cells transfected with a pSG5 vector (29Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Google Scholar) expressing human RARα, RARβ, RARγ, or mouse RXRα. Upon RA treatment of P19 EC cells various downstream targets of retinoid signaling are activated, including Hox genes and the RARβ2 gene. RA also induces differentiation of P19 EC cells in various differentiated derivatives including neural cells (30Edwards M.K. McBurney M.W. Dev. Biol. 1983; 98: 187-191Google Scholar, 31Jones-Villeneuve E.M. McBurney M.W. Rogers K.A. Kalnins V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 253-262Google Scholar, 32McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Google Scholar, 33Roy B. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6481-6487Google Scholar). Because the DE is particularly active in neural cells, we used this system to directly compare the activities of the RAREs derived from the RAREβ2 promoter and the DE. RA Sensitivity of the Distal Element in P19 EC cells and Transgenic Mice Depends on the RARE—In P19 EC cells treated with RA, transcription of a luciferase reporter construct under control of the DE is weakly but significantly (p = 0.05) induced (Fig. 1A). To test whether the RA sensitivity was dependent on the RARE we made point mutations in either or both half-sites of the RARE. Mutations in both half-sites abolish RAR/RXR heterodimer binding (Fig. 1B, DEmut). EMSAs show that mutations in either of the half-sites (DE5′mut and DE3′mut) almost completely abolish RARγ/RXRα binding (Fig. 1C). As expected, the introduction of these different mutations in the DE resulted in loss of RA sensitivity (Fig. 1A). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the RARE motif is essential for the RA sensitivity of the DE in P19 EC cells. To further confirm the in vivo relevance, we used transgenic mouse lines carrying a Hoxb8-LacZ reporter construct driven by the DE or DEmut (Fig. 2A; see Ref. 17Oosterveen T. Niederreither K. Dolle P. Chambon P. Meijlink F. Deschamps J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 262-269Google Scholar). These constructs include an enhancer that drives the expression in more posterior embryonic regions (34Charité J. De Graaff W. Vogels R. Meijlink F. Deschamps J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 294-305Google Scholar) to allow us to verify that the integration site was permissive for expression. Previously we showed that lacZ expression in the hindbrain mediated by the DE depends on Raldh2 (17Oosterveen T. Niederreither K. Dolle P. Chambon P. Meijlink F. Deschamps J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 262-269Google Scholar). Now we investigated its sensitivity in vivo to an excess of exogenous RA. RA treatment at E9.5 of transgenic embryos carrying construct 3 (carrying an intact DE; see Fig. 2A) led at E10.5 to strong activation of the reporter gene in the hindbrain (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, similar treatment of embryos carrying construct 4, which contains the mutated DE (DEmut) did not result in lacZ induction (Fig. 2, D and E). Proper RA treatment was verified by analysis of Hoxb5 response, and the results were confirmed in a second transgenic line carrying the same construct (not shown). These in vivo data confirm the significance of the RA response of the DE observed in the cell transfection assays. The DE-RARE Is Sufficient to Induce RA-dependent Gene Transcription—We compared the RA-induced activities of the RAREs derived from the DE and RARβ2 in P19 EC cells. We used an oligonucleotide of 25 bp containing the DR5 RARβ2-RARE and the flanking base pairs that are evolutionary conserved between mouse and human (18Shen S. van den Brink C.E. Kruijer W. van der Saag P.T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 36: 465-476Google Scholar, 22Rossant J. Zirngibl R. Cado D. Shago M. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1333-1344Google Scholar). This particular element is sensitive to RA starting early during mouse development (22Rossant J. Zirngibl R. Cado D. Shago M. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1333-1344Google Scholar). The RA-dependent activity of two copies of this 25 bp element was much higher than that of an identical configuration of a 25-bp element including the DE-RARE and the same number of its flanking nucleotides (Fig. 3). The activity of the DE-RARE was significantly increased upon RA treatment (p = 0.05) but was lower than that of the complete DE both in the absence and presence of RA. The higher DE activity in the absence of RA is probably due to the presence of other (cryptic) binding sites for transactivators. These results show that other sequences in the DE may influence the activity of the RARE but that they are dispensable for its RA sensitivity. The Distinct Activities of the RAREs of the RARβ2 Gene and the DE Largely Depend on the Single-nucleotide Difference in the RXR-binding Site and on their Direct Context—In striking contrast with the large difference in RA sensitivity between the DE-RARE and the RARβ2-RARE, the sequences of these DR5 RAREs differ by only one bp in each half-site. This should make it basically simple to pinpoint the nucleotides responsible for these distinct sensitivities. We therefore made a series of reporter constructs with two copies of the DE-RARE in which the corresponding RARβ2-specific nucleotide change was introduced in either or both of the half-sites (Fig. 4). In addition, in one construct both of the half-sites of the RARβ2-RARE were converted to a DE-RARE by two single point mutations. As shown in Fig. 4, when the RAR-binding site of the DE was converted into that of the RARβ2-RARE (construct DEβA) the RA sensitivity of this mutated DE was reduced to levels not significantly higher than that of the control (Fig. 4, –RA). In contrast, the transformation of the RXR-binding site of the DE into that of the RARβ2 (construct DEβX) resulted in a very strongly enhanced RA sensitivity, to a level significantly (p = 0.05) higher than that of the RARβ2-RARE. Surprisingly, converting both binding sites of the DE to the corresponding β2-RARE sites (DEβXA) led to a level of sensitivity even marginally higher that that of DEβX, whereas conversion of the RAR site alone (DEβA) resulted in an element that retained only about 20% of the activity of the DE-RARE (DE). Accordingly, changing both half-sites of the RARβ2-RARE into that of the DE (β2XADE) led to a decrease in RA sensitivity. We noted that without additional RA the DEβX and DEβXA elements had higher basal activities than DE and the RARβ2 RARE. One possibility could be that the point mutations introduced in the RXR-binding site create a binding site for another transactivator. Because these motifs mediate high RA sensitivity, a more likely explanation is that they sense the RA present in the fetal calf serum (see Ref. 35Asselineau D. Bernard B.A. Bailly C. Darmon M. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 322-335Google Scholar). To test if the DEβX and DEβXA motifs can detect lower concentrations of RA than the RARβ2-RARE we exposed cells transfected with these constructs to different concentrations of RA. DEβX and DEβXA respond to a RA concentration of 10–9, whereas the RARβ2-RARE respond only slightly to a RA concentration of 10–8 (Fig. 5). Taken together, these data demonstrate that: (1) the single-nucleotide difference in the RXR-binding site of the DE and RARβ2 RARE accounts to a large extent for the distinct activities; (2) the function of certain RAREs may be affected by their immediate flanking sequences; and (3) the activity of a response element not only depends on the sequence of the half-sites but also on their specific combination. The Influence of the Immediate Context on the Activity of a RARE—The sensitivity of the RARβ2-RARE starts between E7.5 and E8.5, whereas the DE starts to be active during later stages of mouse development (E10.0). RA concentration cannot be the major determinant in the timing of activation, because at E8.5 it is not the limiting factor. RA treatment of E8.5 transgenic embryos carrying a DE reporter construct does not activate the reporter at E9.5 (17Oosterveen T. Niederreither K. Dolle P. Chambon P. Meijlink F. Deschamps J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 262-269Google Scholar). The RARE and its direct context might determine the stage-specific activity of this element. Consistent with this, the activity of the DE-RARE in P19 EC cells was only marginally lower when the rest of the DE was deleted. How could the stage-specific activity of the DE-RARE depend on its direct context? Because there is no evidence that RAR/RXR heterodimers contact the flanking nucleotides of the RARE half-sites (13Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Google Scholar), this influence might be indirect. It is known that binding of RAR/RXR induces helical distortion in the DNA (14Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J.

Nucleotides outside the consensus sequence could affect the degree of helical distortions in the RARE and thereby influence its affinity and/or activity. Interestingly, it has been shown for several transactivators, including nuclear hormone receptors, that binding to DNA can induce allosteric modifications (16Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Google Scholar). Such modifications are known to influence the docking of co-factors of RA receptors thereby mediating specific transcriptional responses (10Kurokawa R.

Therefore, the degree of helical DNA distortions in the RARE motif, affected by nucleotides outside the consensus sequence, might result in allosteric modification of the RAR/RXR heterodimer. We propose that these modifications are necessary for the binding of particular proteins that are expressed during specific stages of development, which on their turn are essential for the activity of the RA receptors bound to the DE-RARE.

https://openalex.org/W2087411126,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) activating factor-1 (SAF-1) is an inducible transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of several inflammation-responsive genes including SAA and matrix metalloproteinase-1. Increased synthesis of SAA and matrix metalloproteinase-1 is associated with pathogenesis of several diseases including amyloidosis, arthritis, and atherosclerosis. Previously, we showed in vivo interaction of SAF-1 and protein kinase A (PKA) and presented evidence for induction of SAF-1-regulated genes by a PKA signaling pathway. Here we demonstrate a mechanism by which PKA increases functional activities of SAF-1. Site-directed mutagenesis and phosphorylation analyses revealed two sites in the SAF-1 protein, serine 187 and threonine 386, as the target of PKA. Interestingly, mutation of both PKA phosphorylation sites created a highly active SAF-1 protein with high DNA-binding ability. Furthermore, we found that terminal deletion of SAF-1 protein from either end creates SAF-1 isoforms that are highly transcriptionally active. Partial proteolysis experiments indicated that unphosphorylated and phosphorylated SAF-1 proteins are structurally distinct. Together these results suggest that under native condition, N and C termini of SAF-1 are engaged in an inhibitory intramolecular interaction. PKA-mediated phosphorylation increases transcriptional activity of SAF-1 by unmasking the DNA-binding domain.

Altered gene expression leading either to normal cell growth or pathological conditions, in response to extracellular and/or intracellular signaling, requires participation of activated transcription factors. Many transcription factors remain in an inactive form in the cell but become activated during cytokine- or growth factor-mediated signaling. Activation of transcription factors is therefore regarded as the final step in inducing or repressing specific gene transcription.

Persistent high levels of SAA are linked to various pathophysiological conditions, including amyloidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis (3Sipe J.D. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab.

Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), SAF-1 is identified as a key regulator of increased matrix metalloproteinase 1 synthesis under osteoarthritic conditions. The DNA-binding element of SAF-1 and its human and mouse homolog MAZ/Pur-1 (6Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The DNA-binding and transactivating ability of SAF-1 is induced in response to many inflammatory conditions (2Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Ray A. Ray B.K. DNA. Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Ray A. Schatten H. Ray B.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An understanding of how SAF-1 and its homologs regulate gene expression requires (i) identification of the signaling pathways that activates this transcription factor and (ii) detailed analyses of the involvement of regulatory partners. One powerful approach involves employing the yeast two-hybrid system, which identifies protein-protein interactions that occur in vivo in the course of regulating many cellular activities. Using the two-hybrid system, we recently identified (16Ray B.K. Chen J. Ray A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2343-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that the catalytic subunit of PKA interacts with SAF-1. The PKA signaling pathway is one of the prominent signaling pathways (17Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in the intracellular levels of cAMP, generated by activation of adenylate cyclase, results in the activation of PKA. PKA exists as tetrameric holoenzyme that contains two regulatory cAMP-binding (R-I) subunits and two catalytic (C) subunits. Increase of intracellular cAMP level causes binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits, resulting in the release of the catalytic subunits of PKA (18Kerlavage A.R. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1749-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activated PKA then mediates the effects of cAMP by phosphorylating various substrates, including transcription factors, and thereby affects both the regulation of key metabolic enzymes and expression of numerous target genes. In a previous study (19Ray A. Kumar D. Ray B.K. DNA. Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) we noted that agonists of cAMP markedly increase the DNA-binding ability of endogenous SAF proteins. Furthermore, transactivation potential of SAF-1-regulated promoter was induced in response to ectopic expression of the catalytic subunit of PKA (19Ray A. Kumar D. Ray B.K. DNA. Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The present study was initiated to understand the underlying mechanism through which PKA activates functional capacities of SAF-1. We identified two consensus phosphorylation sites in the SAF-1 protein, one at the N-terminal and the other at the C-terminal end, that are primary targets of PKA. We show that mutation of both of these PKA phosphorylation sites creates a high DNA-binding and transcriptionally active SAF-1 protein. When a single site is mutated, the C-terminal PKA phosphorylation site mutant of SAF-1 displayed virtual inactivity whereas the N-terminal PKA phosphorylation site mutant exhibited high transcriptional activity. Terminal truncation of SAF-1 from either end created transcriptionally active SAF-1 proteins with high DNA-binding function. Limited proteolysis of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated SAF-1 consistently produced slightly different peptide fragments. Together these results indicate that phosphorylation of corresponding domains of SAF-1 by PKA is not directly involved in increasing the DNA-binding activity of this protein; instead phosphorylation by PKA induces a conformational change that exposes the DNA-binding domains of SAF-1. Cell Culture and Transfection—HIG-82 rabbit synoviocyte cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, were derived from the interarticular soft tissue of the knee joint of a normal female New Zealand White rabbit. These cells maintain many of the features of normal rabbit synoviocytes and are activated by phorbol myristic acid and interleukin-1 (20Kolomytkin O.V. Marino A.A. Sadasivan K.K. Wolf R.E. Albright J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C9-C15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIG-82 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing high glucose (4.5 g/liter) supplemented with7% fetal calf serum. Cells were treated with 8-Br-cAMP (0.4 mm), Rp-8-Br-cAMP (0.4 mm), and cell-permeable myristoylated PKA inhibitor 14–22 amide (PKI) (2 μm) as indicated in the text and figure legends. These agents were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Transient transfections of HIG-82 cells were carried out by the calcium phosphate method (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis. T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Model. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The amount of DNA in each transfection assay was kept same by using carrier DNA. Reporter plasmids and the eucaryotic expression vectors containing SAF-1 cDNA or PKA cDNA were transfected in amounts as indicated in the figure legends along with 1 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega). The pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid DNA was used as an internal control for measuring transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, and CAT activity in the cell extracts was determined as described previously (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis. T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Model. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed with the substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis. T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Model. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cell extracts containing equivalent amount of β-galactosidase activity were used for CAT assay. Prior to the CAT assay, each cell extract was heated at 60 °C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous acetylase activity. Different agents used in the transfection assay had no effect on β-galactosidase expression. All transfection experiments were performed at least three times. Plasmids—The CAT reporter plasmids, wt SAF-CAT and mutant SAF-CAT were constructed by ligating three tandem copies of the wild-type SAF-binding element (1Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1584-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 2Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and mutated sequence, respectively into the pBLCAT2 vector (22Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Sequence of the wild-type element was 5′-CCCTTCCTCTCCACCCACAGCCCCCATGG-3′. The sequence of mutant oligonucleotide was 5′-CCATTACTGTCGACTGACAGCTACCATGG-3′. Underlined bases represent altered sequences. Reporter plasmid, 0.6 SAA-CAT3 was constructed by ligating rabbit SAA genomic DNA sequences from –605 to +63 (23Ray B.K. Ray A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) into pBLCAT3 (22Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) vector. The pCMVFLAG-SAF-1 plasmid was constructed by first attaching, in-frame, a FLAG-tagged sequence at the N terminus of the full-length SAF-1 cDNA; the resulting FLAGSAF-1 was further subcloned in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The pCMVFLAGSAF-1(T386A) and pCMVFLAGSAF-1(S187A) mutant plasmids were prepared by subcloning two mutant cDNAs of SAF-1 in the pcDNA3 vector. The mutant cDNAs were generated by megaprimer PCR (24Barik S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 67: 173-182PubMed Google Scholar) using appropriate oligonucleotides ∼35 bp in length. To amplify, effectively, the GC-rich sequences present in the SAF-1 sequence, GC-melt (Clontech) was added to the PCR mixture. The PCR products were subcloned in pTZ19U vector and sequenced for verification of mutations. A FLAG epitope was attached at the N-terminal end of mutant cDNAs prior to subcloning in pcDNA3 vector. The full-length SAF-1 (1–477) and deletion constructs, SAF-1 (1–380) and SAF-1 (188–477) were prepared by subcloning the respective PCR-created fragments into pTZ19U vector. The primer sets used were as follows: for SAF-1 (1–477), 5′-TCGGATCCATGTTCCCCGTGTTCCCTTGCACGCTG-3′ and 5′-GGTCTAGAAGCTCACCAAGGCTGGGAGGGAAGTGG-3′; for SAF-1 (1–380), 5′-TCGGATCCATGTTCCCCGTGTTCCCTTGCACGCTG-3′ and 5′-GGTCTAGAGCGATCCTTCGTAGCAAAAGCTG-3′; for SAF-1 (188–477), 5′-TCGGATCCATGAAGGGGCCCTACATCTGCGCCCTG-3′ and 5′-GGTCTAGAAGCTCACCAAGGCTGGGAGGGAAGTGG-3′. Protein Preparation—To prepare proteins, both wild-type and mutant SAF-1 cDNAs, as well as truncated SAF-1 cDNAs, were subcloned into pRSET vector (Invitrogen). Proteins expressed from these clones were purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-agarose (Invitrogen) column chromatography following the manufacturer's protocol. Construction of GAL4DBDSAF-1 Plasmids—Plasmid RSV-GAL4DBD (25Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6914-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), encoding the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 gene, which is located within amino acids 1–147, was used to prepare the GAL4DBDSAF-1 construct. Full-length SAF-1 cDNA and the mutant forms of SAF-1 were fused in-frame at the C-terminal to GAL4DBD at the unique BamHI site. The resulting clones were verified by DNA sequencing. To assay for promoter activation, a reporter CAT gene with minimum basal activity and three GAL4 DNA-binding sites designated as pGAL4-CAT (25Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6914-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) were chosen. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSA was performed with equal protein amounts of bacterially expressed proteins according to the methods described previously (2Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford's method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probe containing SAF-binding element of SAA promoter was prepared by using [α-32P]dCTP as the substrate to label the double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (2Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two complimentary oligonucleotides, 5′-GGCTTCCTCTCCACCCACAGCCC-3′ and 3′-CGAAGGAGAGGTGGGTGTCGGGGG-5′, were annealed to prepare the double-stranded SAF-binding element. In some assays, bacterially expressed wild-type and mutant SAF-1 proteins were phosphorylated with 1.0 unit of the catalytic subunit of PKA (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) in a volume of 10 μl prior to the DNA-binding assay. Some assays contained calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (4.0 units). In Vitro Phosphorylation—The phosphorylation reaction was performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)/10 mm MgCl2/0.1 mm EDTA/1 mm dithiothreitol/0.1 mm ZnCl2/0.2 mm sodium orthovavadate/5 mm NaF/1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/0.5 mg/ml benzamidine/100 μm of unlabeled ATP/10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol)/1.0 unit of PKA (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) in a 20-μl reaction mixture for 45 min at 25 °C. In each reaction, 0.1 μg of purified wild-type or mutant SAF1 proteins or 20 to 50 ng of synthetic SAF-1 peptides was added. Phosphorylated protein was immunoprecipitated by incubating with an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C for 14–16 h in the immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/150 mm NaCl/1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40/0.1% (w/v) SDS/2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride/0.5 mg/ml benzamidine. Next, 50 μl of protein G-agarose slurry was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking in a rotary shaker. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed five times with the immunoprecipitation buffer (5 min each) to remove any unbound radioactivity. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of buffer containing 2% (w/v) SDS/50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)/1.5 m β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. These mixtures were fractionated in SDS-11% polyacrylamide gel, and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. In Vivo Phosphorylation—HIG-82 cells were transfected with pCMVFLAG-SAF-1(wt), pCMVFLAG-SAF-1(S187A,T386A), pCMVFLAGSAF-1(S187A), or pCMVFLAG-SAF-1(T386A) expression plasmids. Following transfection cells were metabolically labeled with 32Pi (0.5 mCi/ml) in phosphate-free DMEM for 6h in the presence of 8-Br-cAMP(0.4 mm). Prior to the labeling, the transfected cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum for 24 h. The 32P-labeled cells were harvested, washed quickly in phosphate-free DMEM, and lysed by adding hot lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% SDS, 3 mm vanadate, 2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After lysis, the lysates were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and the SDS concentration was reduced to 0.05% by adding lysis buffer without SDS. The 32P-labeled proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-FLAG antibody, separated by 11% SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography. Western Immunoblot Assay—Proteins were separated by SDS-11%PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The immunoblotting was performed as described earlier (27Ray A. Yu G.Y. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1027-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibody. Bands were detected by using a chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Limited Proteolysis—Both native and phosphorylated SAF-1 proteins were subjected to partial proteolysis by V8 protease. SAF-1 protein was phosphorylated as described above using non-radioactive ATP. The reaction mixtures were diluted 4-fold with sterile distilled water. Both the native and phosphorylated SAF-1 proteins (1 μg each) were then incubated with V8 protease (0. 5 μg) in a total volume of 10 μl at 37 °C for different time periods as described in the figure legends. Protease reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of a sample buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)/10% (v/v) glycerol/4% (w/v) SDS/1.5 m β-mercaptoethanol and heating the mixture at 95 °C for 10 min. The samples were subsequently fractionated in a SDS-12% PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. SAF-1 protein and its fragments were detected by Western immunoblot analysis using anti-SAF-1 antibody as the primary antibody. Activation of SAF-1 by PKA—Previous studies employing yeast two-hybrid assay showed that SAF-1 associates with the catalytic subunit of PKA (16Ray B.K. Chen J. Ray A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2343-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and activation of PKA in response to cAMP-signaling increased the DNA-binding activity of endogenous SAF proteins in cAMP-treated cells (19Ray A. Kumar D. Ray B.K. DNA. Cell Biol. 2002; 21: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). As PKA is one of the key enzymes involved in the regulation of many biological processes it is reasonable to predict that PKA may be a key effector in modulating expression of genes regulated by SAF-1. To gain further insights into the mechanism by which PKA activates expression of SAF-1-regulated genes, we undertook the following experiments. HIG-82 synovial cells that exhibit optimal response to SAF-1 expression were cotransfected with a reporter gene containing multiple SAF-1 DNA-binding elements and treated with compounds that either activate or inhibit cAMP-mediated signaling. As seen in Fig. 1A, expression of SAF-CAT reporter was induced in response to 8-Br-cAMP but not by Rp-8-Br-cAMP. The inducing effect of 8-Br-cAMP was mimicked by overexpression of PKA following transfection of cells with an expression plasmid containing the catalytic subunit of PKA, pCαPKA (28Uhler M.D. Carmichael D.F. Lee D.C. Chrivia J.C. Krebs E.G. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1300-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Addition of myristoylated PKI inhibitor 14–22 amide peptide markedly reduced expression of SAF-CAT reporter indicating the specificity of PKA action. It is noteworthy that expression of the reporter gene was induced by both 8-Br-cAMP and PKA, which probably is because of activation of endogenous SAF-1 by these agents. Because the reporter used in these assays was constructed using tandem multiple copies of short SAF-1 DNA-binding elements, we further verified the inducive effects of PKA by using a natural promoter, 0.6 SAA-CAT3 reporter gene that contained a 600-bp upstream promoter region of rabbit SAA gene (2Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Ray B.K. Ray A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The HIG-82 cells were transfected with 0.6 SAA-CAT3 plasmid either alone or together with pCMVSAF-1 and pCαPKA expression plasmids, as indicated (Fig. 1B). Both 8-Br-cAMP and PKA increased expression of 0.6SAACAT reporter similarly. However, the rate of induction was more profound with the SAF-CAT reporter. Next, to assess how PKA potentiates SAF-1 action, we determined whether SAF-1 is phosphorylated by PKA. Bacterially expressed FLAG-SAF1 protein was incubated with purified catalytic subunit of PKA and [γ-32P]ATP and further immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. A strong radioactive band comigrating at the predicted size of FLAG-SAF1 protein (Fig. 1C, lane 1) was seen but not in the lanes where phosphatase was included in the phosphorylation assay (Fig. 1C, lane 2) or where PKA was absent in the reaction mixture (Fig. 1C, lane 3). As cotransfection of cells with activators of PKA or PKA itself induced SAF-regulated promoters, we wondered whether phosphorylation by PKA alters the capacity of SAF-1 to interact with DNA. As seen in Fig. 1D, PKA-mediated phosphorylation markedly increased (about 10-fold as judged by the radioactivity in the DNA-protein complex) the DNA-binding activity of SAF-1 (compare lanes 1 and 2). Formation of no DNA-protein when phosphatase was included (lane 3) or when SAF-1 protein was omitted (lane 4) indicated the specificity of this assay. This result was in accord with previous observations that showed increased DNA-binding ability of endogenous SAF proteins in cAMP-treated cells (19Ray A. Kumar D. Ray B.K. DNA.

Western blot assay with anti-FLAG antibody was performed to verify the input of SAF-1 protein in each DNA-binding assay (Fig. 1E). PKA Directly Affects Transactivating Ability of SAF-1—The observation that PKA-mediated phosphorylation markedly improves the DNA-binding ability of SAF-1 protein prompted us to investigate whether overall increase of transactivation potential of SAF-1 is because of just increased DNA-binding ability or because of a combination of increased DNA-binding and transactivating functions. To test these possibilities we fused, in-frame, the full-length SAF-1 cDNA downstream of the DNA-binding domain of yeast GAL4 transcription factor and tested the transactivation potential of this chimeric protein using a CAT reporter construct driven by highly specific GAL4 DNA-binding promoter. Because the GAL4 fusion protein is the only protein that recognizes GAL4 DNA-binding promoter of yeast origin, this assay system produces little or no background interference in mammalian cells. A marked increase in the basal transcription was observed with GAL4DBD-SAF1 construct indicating the presence of transactivating domains in SAF-1 protein (Fig. 2). The transcription of GAL4-CAT reporter was further enhanced when cells were co-transfected with PKA expression plasmid DNA indicating that PKA directly increases transactivating potential of SAF-1. Together these results strongly suggested that SAF-1 transcription factor is a target of PKA-mediated signaling. Mapping of the Major PKA Phosphorylation Sites in SAF-1—To map the sites in SAF-1 that are phosphorylated by PKA, we examined the primary amino acid sequence of SAF-1. The consensus PKA phosphorylation sites are identified as (R/K)(R/K)X(S/T), RXX(S/T), or RX(S/T) (X denotes any amino acid) in which the former one is the most potent phosphate acceptor site. Primary sequence of SAF-1 showed two major PKA phosphorylation sites, one at the KKRKS187 and the other at RAHT386 peptide sequence. The RAHT386 is located in the middle of the fifth zinc finger. Both of these sites are highly conserved and present in the human, rabbit, and mouse species (Fig. 3A). First, we examined whether these sequences are authentic PKA phosphorylation sites. Two short peptides, SAF-1(PKA1) and SAF-1(PKA2), containing sequences of these regions, were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation with PKA and [γ-32P]ATP. Both of these peptides were efficiently labeled (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4) whereas the mutant peptides in which serine 187 and threonine 386 were replaced with alanine remained unlabeled (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that these amino acid sequences of SAF-1 are potential targets of PKA-mediated phosphorylation. To determine whether the above mentioned sites are indeed PKA phosphorylation sites, as well as to understand the functional significance of these two putative PKA phosphorylation sites in the context of native SAF-1 protein, we opted to prepare mutants in which these sites are specifically mutated. A double mutant SAF-1(S187A,T386A) was prepared in which both Ser187 and Thr386 were replaced with non-phosphorylatable alanine (Fig. 4A). To understand the role of each site, we also prepared two single site mutants of SAF-1 (Fig. 4A). First, we verified by in vitro phosphorylation assay the effectiveness of these mutations in terms of resisting phosphorylation when these altered sequences are parts of SAF-1 protein. To determine, wild-type and mutant cDNAs of SAF-1 were cloned in bacterial expression vector; proteins were expressed and affinity-purified. Equal amounts of each protein were subjected to in vitro phosphorylation assay with purified PKA, and radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue staining was performed to determine the amount and quality of each protein used in the phosphorylation assay (Fig. 4B). As seen in the Fig. 4C, lane 2 the double mutant SAF-1(S187A, T386A) containing two defective phosphorylation sites was very poorly labeled as compared with the wild-type SAF-1 protein (Fig. 4C, lane 1). Because Coomassie Blue staining of these proteins indicated the use of approximately equal amounts of the substrates in the kinase reaction, these data clearly showed that in vitro phosphorylation of SAF-1 is mainly dependent on serine 187 and threonine 386."
https://openalex.org/W2054115396,"Mice infected with the NYU-2 strain of Plasmodium berghei were used to study the effect of chloroquine on masking of a lipid that promotes ferriprotoporphyrin IX dimerization. More than 40% of this lipid was masked and unable to promote dimerization in membrane ghosts from erythrocytes of untreated, infected mice. Thus, preparations of membrane ghosts dimerized 57 ± 6 nmol of ferriprotoporphyrin IX during a 2-h incubation, whereas the lipids extracted from these preparations dimerized 101 ± 11 nmol of ferriprotoporphyrin IX (means ± S.D. for four experiments). Exposure of membrane ghosts to sonication or cold significantly increased the extent of masking. In addition, chloroquine treatment of infected mice increased the extent of masking to ∼90%. The lipid could be unmasked by extracting it into acetone or by aging erythrocyte membrane ghosts from untreated or chloroquine-treated, infected mice for 24 h at pH 7.4 and 25 °C. These findings indicate that masking and unmasking of a lipid is central to the regulation of ferriprotoporphyrin IX dimerization in malaria parasites. They also indicate that chloroquine impairs the function of this regulatory process.

They also indicate that chloroquine impairs the function of this regulatory process. When mice infected with Plasmodium berghei are treated with chloroquine, the parasites lose 80% or more of their ability to produce β-hematin (1Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 2073-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a dimer of ferriprotoporphyrin IX (FP) 1The abbreviation used is: FP, ferriprotoporphyrin IX. 1The abbreviation used is: FP, ferriprotoporphyrin IX. (2Pagola S. Stephens P.W. Bohle D.S. Kosar A.D. Madsen S.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Consequently, undimerized, toxic FP accumulates (3Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and, presumably, kills the parasites (4Fitch C.D. Parasitol. Today. 1986; 2: 330-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Fitch C.D. Kanjananggulpan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15552-15555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for the effect of chloroquine on the production of betahematin in vivo presently is unknown. It is true that chloroquine and other quinoline derivatives, including quinine and mefloquine, bind to FP and inhibit dimerization in vitro (3Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 6Slater A.F.G. Cerami A. Nature. 1992; 355: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), but something else occurs in vivo. In fact, inhibition of FP dimerization by chloroquine is antagonized by quinine and mefloquine in vivo (3Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These and other observations indicate that chloroquine acts by affecting a regulatory process rather than by directly inhibiting FP dimerization (7Fitch C.D. Chou A.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2461-2465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the biochemical basis for the antimalarial action of chloroquine, therefore, it is desirable to know more about the process that regulates FP dimerization. Current knowledge of FP dimerization in malaria parasites can be briefly summarized as follows. The process is promoted only by the lipid fraction of parasitized erythrocytes (8Fitch C.D. Cai G.-z. Chen Yi-f. Shoemaker J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Apparently, the lipid serves to concentrate monomeric FP and keep it in a state favorable for dimerization (8Fitch C.D. Cai G.-z. Chen Yi-f. Shoemaker J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Once formed, FP dimers spontaneously aggregate in an acidic milieu (2Pagola S. Stephens P.W. Bohle D.S. Kosar A.D. Madsen S.K. Nature. 2000; 404: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar) such as occurs in the digestive vacuoles of malaria parasites. These aggregates are insoluble at physiologic pH or lower (5Fitch C.D. Kanjananggulpan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15552-15555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, in contrast to undimerized FP, they appear to be nontoxic for malaria parasites. Since malaria parasites are enriched with linoleic acid, it is likely that linoleate or a linoleate derivative is the lipid that promotes FP dimerization (9Fitch C.D. Cai G.-z. Shoemaker J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1535: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The linoleate probably is released from the inner membranes of hemoglobin-laden endocytic vesicles as they are processed into digestive vacuoles (10Orjih A.U. Exp. Biol. Med. 2001; 226: 746-752Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). If so, the release of linoleate and of undimerized FP could occur simultaneously and, by immediately co-precipitating with each other, protect the parasite from the toxicities of both (9Fitch C.D. Cai G.-z. Shoemaker J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1535: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the malaria parasite could regulate FP dimerization and protect itself from FP toxicity by regulating the release and accessibility of linoleate. In this report, we demonstrate that the lipid that promotes FP dimerization is partially masked in erythrocyte membrane ghosts prepared from mice infected with P. berghei. In addition, we show that there is significantly more masking after chloroquine treatment of malarious mice. The term “masking” is used to indicate that some substance is interacting with lipid in such a way as to make it unable to promote FP dimerization. Erythrocytes were obtained from young male Swiss mice infected with chloroquine-susceptible P. berghei NYU-2 parasites when their parasitemias reached ∼1500 parasites per 1000 erythrocytes, usually on day 6 or 7 of infection. In young mice, this parasite infects erythrocytes of all ages, and it produces an asynchronous infection. Male mice weighing ∼25 g were purchased from Harlan-Teklad (Madison, WI) for these experiments, and they were infected by intraperitoneal passage of erythrocytes infected with ∼106 parasites. Their care was in accord with St. Louis University policies. When treated with chloroquine, each mouse received 3 μmol of intraperitoneally 6 h before erythrocytes were collected. Parasitemia was determined by counting erythrocytes and parasites in Giemsa stained blood films. For these experiments, erythrocytes were collected, washed twice, and frozen in liquid nitrogen, all as described previously (1Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 2073-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The frozen erythrocytes were thawed by warming at room temperature when needed for an experiment, and membrane ghosts were collected by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 10 min and washed twice by resuspension in 10 ml of the standard medium and centrifugation. The initial centrifugation and the washes were at room temperature when the ghosts were scheduled to be aged at 25 °C and at 4 °C when they were scheduled to be aged at 4 °C. The standard medium contained 68 mm sodium chloride, 4.8 mm potassium chloride, and 1.2 mm magnesium sulfate. It was buffered to pH 7.4 with 50 mm sodium phosphate. To evaluate the effect of aging at 4 and 25 °C on the ability to dimerize FP, aliquots of membrane ghosts equivalent to 50 μl of packed erythrocytes from untreated or chloroquine-treated mice were mixed with standard medium to achieve a total volume of 0.2 ml and preincubated at pH 7.4 and the selected temperatures for various periods of time. No β-hematin was formed during the preincubation, since FP dimerization does not occur at neutral pH or 4 °C (1Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 2073-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After preincubation, 1.6 ml of 0.125 m sodium acetate (pH 5) and 700 nmol of FP dissolved in 0.2 ml of 5 mm NaOH were added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the assay of FP dimerizing activity as described below. Related experiments evaluated the effect of preincubation with FP on cold-induced loss of FP dimerizing activity. For these experiments, washed membrane ghosts equivalent to 50 μl of packed, infected erythrocytes were suspended to a total volume of 0.3 ml with standard medium or with 0.2 ml of standard medium plus 0.1 ml of 5 mm NaOH containing 350 nmol of FP. After preincubation at 37 °C for 30 min, both incubation mixtures were incubated for another 24 h at 4 °C. Then 1.5 ml of 0.125 mm sodium acetate (pH 5) and 0.2 ml of 5 mm NaOH containing 700 nmol of FP were added for the assay of FP dimerizing activity as described below. Since one incubation mixture contained more FP than the other when dimerizing activity was assayed, it is important to note that 100 nmol of FP per ml of incubation mixture is sufficient to saturate the process and that additional amounts have no additional effect (1Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 2073-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the course of the foregoing experiments, we noticed that sonication had a deleterious effect on the ability of membrane ghosts to dimerize FP. Therefore, we also evaluated the effect of FP added prior to sonication on the loss of FP dimerizing activity. For these experiments, membrane ghosts equivalent to 50 μl of infected erythrocytes were suspended to achieve a total volume of 0.4 ml in 0.125 m sodium acetate (pH 5) or in a mixture of 0.2 ml of 0.125 mm sodium acetate (pH 5) and 0.2 ml of 5 mm NaOH containing 700 nmol of FP. Immediately upon adding FP to the second tube, both tubes were sonicated (8 × 5-s bursts at a power of 140 watts). For the assay of FP dimerizing activity after sonication, 1.6 ml of 0.125 m sodium acetate (pH 5) were added to the suspension of membrane ghosts that had received FP prior to sonication, and 1.4 ml of 0.125 m sodium acetate (pH 5) and 0.2 ml of 5 mm NaOH containing 700 nmol of FP were added to the other suspension for the assay of FP dimerization as described below. The next experiments were designed to evaluate the extent of masking of the lipid that promotes FP dimerization in membrane ghosts. For these experiments, a protease inhibitor mixture was added immediately after thawing frozen erythrocytes and before membrane ghosts were collected and washed. For each ml of erythrocyte suspension, the protease inhibitor mixture consisted of 100 μl of 40 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μl of 250 μg/ml of pepstatin A, and 20 μl of 1 mm transepoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane. The first two inhibitors were dissolved in absolute ethanol, and the third one was dissolved in 50% ethanol. After adding the protease inhibitor mixture, membrane ghosts were prepared and washed at 4 °C as described above and used for extraction of lipids into acetone. For extraction of lipids, washed membrane ghosts were suspended in 30 mm n-octyl glucopyranoside in the standard medium at pH 7.4 (using a volume equal to the volume of the initial erythrocyte suspension) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with occasional vigorous mixing. Afterward, the supernatant fluid and pellet were separated by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature. Hemozoin FP remained in the pellet. To extract lipids into acetone, the supernatant fluid was lyophilized, acetone at minus 20 °C was added to the resulting powder (10 times the volume of the initial erythrocyte suspension), and the mixture was incubated in an ice bath for 30 min with occasional vigorous mixing. Then the mixture was centrifuged to separate the pellet from the acetone extract. FP dimerization was measured in erythrocyte ghosts, in acetone extracts, in the pellets that remained after n-octyl glucopyranoside extraction, and in the pellets that remained after acetone extraction of the lyophilized n-octyl glucopyranoside extract. To prepare an acetone extract for measurement of FP dimerization, an aliquot was transferred to a polycarbonate tube and thoroughly dried under a stream of nitrogen, after which the dried material was resuspended in 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5) with the aid of sonication. To prepare the pellets for measurement of FP dimerization, they were dried under a stream of nitrogen and suspended in 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5) with the aid of sonication. FP dimerizing activity was assayed as described previously (1Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 2073-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Fitch C.D. Chou A.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, preparations of interest were suspended in 0.1 m sodium acetate (pH 5) with an excess of FP and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The incubations were terminated by centrifugation, and the undimerized FP was washed out of the pellet with 2.5% SDS dissolved in the standard medium. β-Hematin in the preparations before and after incubation was hydrolyzed to FP under alkaline conditions, and the FP was measured spectrophotometrically (12Asakura T. Minakata K. Adachi K. Russell M.O. Schwartz E. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 59: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This method has been used previously in quantitative studies of synthetic β-hematin and found to be satisfactory (8Fitch C.D. Cai G.-z. Chen Yi-f. Shoemaker J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). FP dimerizing activity was calculated from the increase in amount of β-hematin during incubation. Chloroquine-induced masking of the lipid that promotes FP dimerization is demonstrated by the data presented in Fig. 1 and Table I. The figure shows the effects of aging at 4 and 25 °C on FP dimerizing activity in erythrocyte membrane ghosts from untreated or treated mice infected with P. berghei. As expected, chloroquine treatment caused more than an 80% reduction in FP dimerizing activity. When these ghosts were incubated at 25 °C, however, there was a 22-fold increase in FP dimerizing activity between the 15th and 24th h, from 34 to 748 nmol of FP dimerized per h per ml of packed erythrocytes (normalized to represent a parasitemia of 1000 parasites per 1000 erythrocytes). During the same time period, the FP dimerizing activity in membrane ghosts from infected, untreated mice nearly doubled. After aging for 24 h at 25 °C, therefore, the FP dimerizing activities of erythrocyte membrane ghosts from untreated and chloroquine-treated, infected mice were approximately equal. Thus, it is apparent that erythrocyte membrane ghosts from infected, chloroquine-treated mice possessed the full complement of the substance that promotes FP dimerization and that most of it was masked. This finding is in agreement with the earlier observation that chloroquine treatment does not reduce the amount of linoleate in erythrocytes from mice infected with P. berghei (9Fitch C.D. Cai G.-z. Shoemaker J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1535: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and with the data presented in Table I, which reveal that these erythrocyte membrane ghosts possess the full complement of the lipid that promotes FP dimerization. Aging at 4 °C did not allow unmasking of the lipid that promotes FP dimerization in preparations from chloroquine-treated mice (Fig. 1), and it caused nearly complete masking of the lipid in preparations from untreated mice.Table IEffect of chloroquine treatment on FP dimerizationPreparationTreatmentFP dimerizedaNanomol of FP dimerized per ml of incubation mixture during the 2-h incubation period.GhostsNone57 ± 6Acetone extractNone101 ± 11GhostsChloroquine8 ± 2Acetone extractChloroquine85 ± 10a Nanomol of FP dimerized per ml of incubation mixture during the 2-h incubation period. Open table in a new tab Additional information about the effects of sonication and cold exposure in vitro are presented in Table II. Interestingly, cold-induced masking of the lipid that promotes FP dimerization could be prevented by preincubation with FP. The data in Table II also demonstrate that sonication increases the masking of the lipid that promotes FP dimerization. Under the conditions used, sonication-induced masking was not as complete as after prolonged incubation at 4 °C, but it too was prevented by FP.Table IIEffect of cold and sonication on FP dimerization by membrane ghosts of erythrocytes infected with P. bergheiTreatmentFPDAaFP dimerizing activity expressed as nmol of FP dimerized per h per ml of packed erythrocytes (normalized to a parasitemia of 1000 parasites per 1000 erythrocytes).PbThe P values are for comparisons by the two tailed t test of no treatment (none) and the indicated treatment.None657 ± 176 (8)cMeans ± S.D. and number of experiments are shown.4 °C, 24 h47 ± 31 (4)<0.0014 °C, 24 h with FP553 ± 57 (4)Sonication241 ± 97 (4)<0.01Sonication with FP622 ± 158 (4)a FP dimerizing activity expressed as nmol of FP dimerized per h per ml of packed erythrocytes (normalized to a parasitemia of 1000 parasites per 1000 erythrocytes).b The P values are for comparisons by the two tailed t test of no treatment (none) and the indicated treatment.c Means ± S.D. and number of experiments are shown. Open table in a new tab In earlier experiments, we found that the lipid that promotes FP dimerization is present but masked in membrane ghosts from normal mouse erythrocytes (8Fitch C.D. Cai G.-z. Chen Yi-f. Shoemaker J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and some of this lipid could be unmasked by extraction into chloroform. The same extraction procedure, however, did not reveal masking of the lipid in membrane ghosts from erythrocytes of mice infected with P. berghei (8Fitch C.D. Cai G.-z. Chen Yi-f. Shoemaker J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Apparently, the failure to observe masking in these early experiments was due to incomplete extraction of the lipid into chloroform. In support of this possibility, the present acetone-based method extracted nearly three times as much FP dimerizing activity as the chloroform-based method. Moreover, in excess of 40% of the activity was masked in membrane ghosts from untreated, infected mice (Table I, cf. membrane ghosts and comparable acetone extracts). In agreement with the earlier work (8Fitch C.D. Cai G.-z. Chen Yi-f. Shoemaker J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1454: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), no FP dimerizing activity was found in the protein or in hemozoin FP of P. berghei. Studies of the lipid fraction of erythrocyte membrane ghosts from chloroquine-treated, infected mice also are summarized in Table I. In agreement with previous reports (1Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Life Sci. 1992; 51: 2073-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Chou A.C. Fitch C.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), chloroquine treatment caused an 86% reduction in FP dimerization in membrane ghosts. After extraction with acetone, however, the lipid recovered from these ghosts promoted dimerization of approximately as much FP as comparable preparations from untreated mice (Table I, p > 0.08 in a test of the null hypothesis by the two tailed t test). From these results, it is evident that 90% of the lipid that promotes FP dimerization was masked in erythrocyte membrane ghosts from chloroquine-treated, infected mice. There are two plausible scenarios to explain chloroquine-induced masking of lipid in malaria parasites. The first one is based on the observation that a large fraction of the lipid exists naturally in a masked state (Fig. 1 and Table I). It assumes that there is a regulated process to unmask lipid as it is needed to promote FP dimerization. This scenario is consistent with the fact that the inner membranes of hemoglobin-laden endocytic vesicles disappear when the vesicles are incorporated into digestive vacuoles (13Slomianny C. Prensier G. Charet P. Parasitology. 1985; 90: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 14Rudzinska M.A. Trager W. Bray R.S. J. Protozool. 1965; 12: 563-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Bannister L.H. Hopkins J.M. Fowler R.E. Krishna S. Mitchell G.H. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 16Aikawa M. Seed T.M. Kreier J.P. Malaria. 1. Academic Press, 1980: 285-344Google Scholar). Since the inner membranes are derived from the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane, this scenario also is consistent with the recent hypothesis that the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane is somehow involved in the formation of hemozoin crystals (17Hempelmann E. Motta C. Hughes R. Ward S.A. Bray P.G. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 23-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As the inner membranes disappear, their constituents presumably are released, thus making a lipid, probably linoleate (9Fitch C.D. Cai G.-z. Shoemaker J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1535: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), accessible to promote FP dimerization. Since chloroquine halts the incorporation of endocytic vesicles into digestive vacuoles (18Macomber P.B. Sprinz H. Tousimis A.J. Nature. 1967; 214: 937-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19Warhurst D.C. Hockley D.J. Nature. 1967; 214: 935-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20Einheber A. Palmer D.M. Aikawa M. Exp. Parasitol. 1976; 40: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to suppose that chloroquine also would halt the unmasking of the lipid that promotes FP dimerization. Indeed, it is possible that chloroquine-induced masking of lipid occurs first and is responsible for halting the processing of endocytic vesicles. The second scenario is based on evidence that sonication and incubation in the cold inhibits the process of FP dimerization either by affecting the critical micelle concentration or by exposing the process to endogenous inhibitors (Table II). We favor the latter possibility and assume that malaria parasites normally regulate exposure of FP dimerization to endogenous inhibitors. These inhibitors could act either by preventing the unmasking of a lipid or by serving as masking agents. The first possibility can be discarded, however, since FP in the incubation medium protected against inhibition by sonication and cold (Table II). Protection by FP means that a certain amount of lipid was unmasked and accessible to FP before sonication or exposure to cold. Thus, this scenario leads to two conclusions: (a) an endogenous masking agent for the lipid that promotes FP dimerization is present in malaria parasites and (b) an intracellular barrier ordinarily governs exposure of the lipid to this agent. Both conclusions are reasonable, since FP dimerization is compartmentalized either in endocytic vesicles as they are processed into digestive vacuoles or later in the digestive vacuoles. If both conclusions are correct, it would follow that chloroquine acts by impairing the ability of malaria parasites to regulate access of an endogenous masking agent to the lipid that promotes FP dimerization. It is not yet certain which of the above scenarios best describes the situation in malaria parasites. Possibly, elements of both may be required to completely describe the regulation of FP dimerization. In any case, the observation of chloroquine-induced masking of a lipid provides new insight into the biochemical basis for the antimalarial action of chloroquine."
https://openalex.org/W2129860708,"Intracellular cycling of the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) between different compartments is directed by signals localized in its cytoplasmic tail. A di-aromatic motif (Phe18-Trp19 with Trp19 as the key residue) in its cytoplasmic tail is required for the sorting of the receptor from late endosomes back to the Golgi apparatus. However, the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) lacks such a di-aromatic motif. Therefore the ability of amino acids other than aromatic residues to replace Trp19 in the CD-MPR cytoplasmic tail was tested. Mutant constructs with bulky hydrophobic residues (valine, isoleucine, or leucine) instead of Trp19 exhibited 30–60% decreases in binding to the tail interacting protein of 47 kDa (Tip47), a protein mediating this transport step, and partially prevented receptor delivery to lysosomes. Decreasing hydrophobicity of residues at position 19 resulted in further impairment of Tip47 binding and an increase of receptor accumulation in lysosomes. Intriguingly, mutants mislocalized to lysosomes did not completely co-localize with a lysosomal membrane protein, which might suggest the presence of subdomains within lysosomes. These data indicate that sorting of the CD-MPR in late endosomes requires a distinct di-aromatic motif with only limited possibilities for variations, in contrast to the CI-MPR, which seems to require a putative loop (Pro49-Pro-Ala-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly55) along with additional hydrophobic residues in the cytoplasmic tail. This raises the possibility of two separate binding sites on Tip47 because both receptors require binding to Tip47 for endosomal sorting. Intracellular cycling of the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) between different compartments is directed by signals localized in its cytoplasmic tail. A di-aromatic motif (Phe18-Trp19 with Trp19 as the key residue) in its cytoplasmic tail is required for the sorting of the receptor from late endosomes back to the Golgi apparatus. However, the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) lacks such a di-aromatic motif. Therefore the ability of amino acids other than aromatic residues to replace Trp19 in the CD-MPR cytoplasmic tail was tested. Mutant constructs with bulky hydrophobic residues (valine, isoleucine, or leucine) instead of Trp19 exhibited 30–60% decreases in binding to the tail interacting protein of 47 kDa (Tip47), a protein mediating this transport step, and partially prevented receptor delivery to lysosomes. Decreasing hydrophobicity of residues at position 19 resulted in further impairment of Tip47 binding and an increase of receptor accumulation in lysosomes. Intriguingly, mutants mislocalized to lysosomes did not completely co-localize with a lysosomal membrane protein, which might suggest the presence of subdomains within lysosomes. These data indicate that sorting of the CD-MPR in late endosomes requires a distinct di-aromatic motif with only limited possibilities for variations, in contrast to the CI-MPR, which seems to require a putative loop (Pro49-Pro-Ala-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly55) along with additional hydrophobic residues in the cytoplasmic tail. This raises the possibility of two separate binding sites on Tip47 because both receptors require binding to Tip47 for endosomal sorting. The biogenesis of lysosomes depends on the correct sorting of acid hydrolases from their place of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum to their final destination in lysosomes. Newly synthesized enzymes are tagged with a mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker by the concerted action of two enzymes: one which transfers a GlcNAc-1-phosphate to specific mannose residues on the acid hydrolases and the other which removes the covering GlcNAc to generate the mannose 6-phosphate tag (1Bao M. Elmendorf B.J. Booth J.L. Drake R.R. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31446-31451Google Scholar, 2Kornfeld R. Bao M. Brewer K. Noll C. Canfield W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23203-23210Google Scholar). This tag is required for the subsequent binding of the lysosomal hydrolases to one of two mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) 1The abbreviations used are: MPR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; CD-MPR, cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; CI-MPR, cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; TGN, trans-Golgi network; AP, adaptor protein complex; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; Tip47, tail interacting protein of 47 kDa. 1The abbreviations used are: MPR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; CD-MPR, cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; CI-MPR, cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor; TGN, trans-Golgi network; AP, adaptor protein complex; PNS, post-nuclear supernatant; Tip47, tail interacting protein of 47 kDa. in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The receptor ligand complexes then exit the TGN in clathrin-coated vesicles and fuse with acidified endosomes. Following the pH-induced dissociation of the complexes, the lysosomal enzymes are further packaged into the lysosomes whereas the receptors are recycled back to the TGN to mediate another round of sorting (3Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Google Scholar, 4Hille-Rehfeld A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 177-194Google Scholar).The cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CD-MPR) is a type I integral membrane protein with a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of 67 residues. Within this cytoplasmic tail, several signals have been identified that direct the intracellular trafficking of the receptor. Internalization from the plasma membrane is mediated by 3 independent signals, a pair of phenylalanine residues (Phe13-X-X-X-X-Phe18), a classical tyrosine motif (Tyr45-X-X-Val48), and as indicated by in vitro data by a di-leucine based motif (Leu64-Leu65) (5Johnson K.F. Chan W. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87 (Correction (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A88, 1591): 10010-10014Google Scholar, 6Denzer K. Weber B. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. Pohlmann R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 497-505Google Scholar). The di-leucine motif has been shown in addition to mediate the transport of the CD-MPR from the TGN to the endosomes by interaction with Golgi-localized, γ-ear-containing, adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-binding protein 1 and adaptor protein complex 1 (AP1) and possibly also a sorting event within endosomes (7Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17110-17115Google Scholar, 8Tikkanen R. Obermuller S. Denzer K. Pungitore R. Geuze H.J. von Figura K. Höning S. Traffic. 2000; 1: 631-640Google Scholar). An acidic cluster as part of a casein kinase II site was implicated to be important for sorting in endosomes (9Wan L. Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Rybak S.L. Thomas G. Cell. 1998; 94: 205-216Google Scholar). Furthermore, overlapping with one of the internalization motifs (Phe13-X-X-X-X-Phe18) is a di-aromatic motif (Phe18-Trp19), which is required for the sorting of the receptor from late endosomes back to the TGN and therefore preventing degradation of the receptor in lysosomes (10Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14471-14476Google Scholar). The sorting efficiency of the di-aromatic motif seems to be regulated by a post-translational modification, the reversible palmitoylation of Cys34 (10Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14471-14476Google Scholar, 11Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 577-584Google Scholar).Sorting of the receptor requires the interaction of the signals in the cytoplasmic tail with components of the cytoplasmic sorting machinery at sites of vesicle formation. Two such factors are the clathrin-associated adaptor complexes AP1 and adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2). AP1 mediates the sorting step from the TGN to endosomes and in addition recent data suggest that AP1 might also play a role in recycling MPRs from early endosomes to the TGN (12Meyer C. Zizioli D. Lausmann S. Eskelinen E.L. Hamann J. Saftig P. von Figura K. Schu P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2193-2203Google Scholar), whereas AP2 is required for rapid internalization of the receptor from the plasma membrane (13Höning S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19884-19890Google Scholar). Another protein, phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 (PACS-1), was shown to interact with the receptor tail and AP1 in vitro suggesting that PACS-1 and AP1 may cooperate to sort MPRs (14Crump C.M. Xiang Y. Thomas L. Gu F. Austin C. Tooze S.A. Thomas G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2191-2201Google Scholar). Most recently, the novel family of Golgi-localized, γ-ear-containing, adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-binding proteins (GGA) have been shown to mediate the sorting of MPRs from the TGN to endosomes (15Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C. Gorshkova I. Crouch R.J. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 2001; 292: 1712-1716Google Scholar, 16Zhu Y. Doray B. Poussu A. Lehto V.P. Kornfeld S. Science. 2001; 292: 1716-1718Google Scholar). Yet another sorting event, from late endosomes back to the TGN, is mediated by tail interacting protein of 47 kDa (Tip47), which interacts with the di-aromatic motif (Phe18-Trp19) of the CD-MPR (17Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Google Scholar). Optimal Tip47 function depends on binding to Rab9, a late endosomal GTPase previously implicated in MPR retrieval, further confirming the role of Tip47 in this particular sorting event (18Carroll K.S. Hanna J. Simon I. Krise J. Barbero P. Pfeffer S.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1373-1376Google Scholar). Interestingly Tip47 binds to both MPRs, the CD-MPR and the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) but the CI-MPR does not contain a di-aromatic motif. A mutational analysis revealed that Tip47 seems to bind a putative loop generated by the sequence Pro49-Pro-Ala-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly55 and other hydrophobic residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the CI-MPR (19Orsel J.G. Sincock P.M. Krise J.P. Pfeffer S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9047-9051Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether the binding of Tip47 to the CD-MPR is restricted to a di-aromatic motif or if other residues could replace the aromatic residues.In this study we have analyzed the effect of mutations that change the key residue of the di-aromatic motif (Trp19) to bulky hydrophobic residues, non-polar residues, polar residues, or charged residues. Initial screening for the intracellular localization of CD-MPR constructs containing those mutations by immunofluorescence revealed some differences in the extent of co-localization with Lamp1, a lysosomal marker. To obtain a more quantitative measure for the effect of various mutations we tested their ability to interact with N-terminal His-tagged Tip47 in an in vitro pull-down assay. Constructs with Trp19 replaced by hydrophobic residues such as leucine and valine exhibited a modest impairment of binding to Tip47. However, correct endosomal sorting of the full-length CD-MPR in vivo was only achieved by wild-type receptors whereas the mutants showed an increased missorting to lysosomes by a factor of 5 for replacements of Trp19 by hydrophobic residues and up to a factor of 12 for replacements by charged residues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Enzymes used in molecular cloning were obtained from Roche Diagnostics, New England Biolabs, or Promega; α-minimal essential medium, fetal calf serum, and Lipofectin were from Invitrogen; Percoll was from Amersham Biosciences; nitrocellulose was from Schleicher & Schuell; protease inhibitors from Sigma; ECL Western blotting reagents from PerkinElmer Life Sciences); and cell culture dishes from Falcon. Oligonucleotides were synthesized either by the DNA synthesis facility of the Friedrich Miescher Institute or Microsynth GmBH (Galbach, Switzerland). Goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibodies and goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The mAb 22D4 specific for the bovine CD-MPR and 931A polyclonal antibodies specific for Lamp1 were generously provided by Drs. D. Messner and M. Fukuda, respectively.Recombinant DNA—All basic DNA procedures were as described (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998Google Scholar). The PCR procedure of Ho et al. (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar) was used to generate the mutant constructs with pBSK-MPR TMD/tail (22Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Google Scholar) serving as a template together with bp 170–193 and 1260–1341 of pBSK– as the down- and upstream primers, respectively. Appropriate partial complementary pairs of oligonucleotides in which the desired amino acid replacement had been incorporated were chosen as internal primers. The final PCR products were subcloned into pSFFV-neo as described (22Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Google Scholar). Human Tip47 was cloned by PCR from a Marathon Human Placental cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using Tip47.down (5′-TTTGAATTCGCGGCCGCTGTTCCTGGGACG-3′) and Tip47.up (5′-GAGACGCGTCCCGCTGAGTCCTCTCCTCTCCCC-3′) oligos into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). His6-Tip47 was created using this pcDNA3.1(+)-Tip47 vector as a template for a PCR with the oligos BamHIpQE31-TIP47.-down (5′-CACGGATCCATGTCTGCCGAC-3′) and SacIpQE31-TIP47.up (5′-GCGGAGCTCCCCCTATTTCTTCTCCTCCGGGGC-3′). The PCR product was cut with BamHI and SacI and ligated into pQE31 (Qiagen AG, Basel). All coding sequences created by PCR were verified by sequencing.Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium to 30% confluency before transfection with 1 μg of DNA using FuGENE according to the manufacturer's directions. The cells were incubated with 100 μm each of pepstatin A and leupeptin 24 h before the experiment and analyzed 48 h post-transfection by confocal microscopy.A mannose-6-P/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor-deficient mouse L cell line designated D9 (LRec–) was maintained in α-minimal essential medium. The cells were transfected with XbaI-linearized DNA with Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's directions. Selection for resistance to neomycin (G418) was carried out using 500 μg/ml G418 as the final concentration. Resistant colonies were picked individually and screened for the expression of bovine CD-MPR by immunoblotting. Clones expressing similar amounts of receptor were expanded for further study and maintained in selective medium.Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Deconvolution—Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out as described (23Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Google Scholar). Paraformaldehyde-fixed and saponin-permeabilized cells were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of monoclonal antibody 22D4 and a 1:400 dilution of Ab 931A. The secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibodies and goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 conjugates, diluted 1:1000. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides with ProLong Antifade (Molecular Probes) for viewing with an Olympus Fluoview FV500 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Serial sections in the z axis through the entire cells were taken, and the resulting stacks of images were processed on a multiprocessor SGI UNIX computer using the Huygens program (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, The Netherlands). A maximum likelihood estimation-based algorithm was used for image reconstruction. Z-stacks were exported as Tiff files and analyzed with the use of the Imaris program (Bitplane AG, Zürich, Switzerland).In Vitro Pull-down Experiments—N-terminal His-tagged Tip47 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain M15. A saturated overnight culture was diluted 1:10 in 200 ml of growth medium and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C before induction with 1.0 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by sonication in 20 ml of binding buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4·H2O, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl) containing a 1:500 dilution of a protease inhibitor mixture (5 mg/ml benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin in 40% dimethyl sulfoxide, 60% ethanol) (PIC) and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (40 μg/ml) (final concentration). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall GSA centrifuge. 4 ml of the supernatant was incubated for 30 min at room temperature on a rotating shaker with 400 μl of Ni-CAM HC resin (50% suspension) (Sigma) that was prewashed with binding buffer and blocked with binding buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The beads were washed 2 times with wash buffer (binding buffer at pH 6.0) and once with assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 8 mm imidazole, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) by spinning them at 1000 rpm for 1 min in a Heraeus centrifuge. Extracts from mouse D9 (LRec–) cells expressing wild-type or mutant CD-MPR constructs were prepared from cells grown on 15-cm Falcon tissue culture dishes in the following way. Confluent 15-cm dishes of cells were put on ice and washed once with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 5 ml of assay buffer containing PIC and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C in a Heraeus centrifuge and resuspended in 1 ml of assay buffer containing PIC and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were homogenized in a ball bearing homogenizer of 51.2 μm clearance using 12 strokes and spun at 700 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifugation was repeated until no pellet appeared. The protein concentration of the post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay. The appropriate amounts of PNS from each of the mutant cell lines and wild-type cell line expressing the same amount of CD-MPR were determined by Western blotting with anti-CD-MPR monoclonal antibody 22D4 followed by densitometric scanning and quantification using ImageQuant 5.0 software (Amersham Biosciences). These PNS amounts adjusted for expression levels were used for the assay.Beads incubated with His6-Tip47 were resuspended in 200 μl of assay buffer containing PIC and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 50 μlof resuspended beads were incubated with 200 μg of PNS from the wild-type cell line or an appropriate amount of PNS from mutant cell lines according to the expression level adjustment described above for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating shaker. Beads were spun at 2500 rpm for 4 min at room temperature in an Eppendorf tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was collected and stored. The beads were washed three times with assay buffer. Sample buffer was added to the beads to a total volume of 40 μl, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-CD-MPR monoclonal antibody 22D4. An aliquot of each of the supernatants was also analyzed similarly to determine the amount of unbound receptor. The amount of CD-MPR bound to His6-Tip47 was determined by densitometric scanning using ImageQuant 5.0 software.Percoll Gradient Fractionation—Confluent D9 (LRec–) cells stably expressing wild-type or mutant forms of the CD-MPR were grown in a 100-mm Petri dish and incubated for 24 h in growth medium supplemented with 100 μm each of pepstatin A and leupeptin. The cells were then harvested, ruptured with a ball bearing homogenizer, and fractionated on 17.5% Percoll density gradients as described previously (22Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Google Scholar). The specificity of the lysosomal fractions was tested using a β-hexosaminidase assay as described previously (23Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Google Scholar) (data not shown).SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels (Bio-Rad) by using the Laemmli system (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). After electrophoresis gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes according to the method of Towbin et al. (25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). The immunoblotting was performed as previously described (22Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Google Scholar). The autoradiographs were quantitated by using a personal densitometer (Amersham Biosciences).Assays and Miscellaneous Methods—β-Hexosaminidase activity was determined as described (22Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit by using protein standard I.RESULTSIntracellular Location of CD-MPR Wild-type Versus Mutant Forms—To determine whether the replacement of Trp19 in the cytoplasmic tail of the CD-MPR by various amino acids affects its ability to avoid delivery to lysosomes, wild-type and mutant constructs were prepared and expressed in HeLa cells. The cells were incubated for 24 h with pepstatin A and leupeptin to prevent degradation of receptor that was mislocalized to the lysosomes (23Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Google Scholar). After fixation with paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with saponin the cells were stained with antibodies against the CD-MPR and Lamp1, followed by the appropriate secondary antibodies. As expected, Lamp1 (Fig. 1, green) was localized in doughnut-shaped structures typical for the staining of a lysosomal membrane protein. In contrast, the CD-MPR wild-type (Fig. 1A, red) showed a predominant perinuclear staining representing localization in the TGN and late endosomes and, to a lesser extent, some peripheral staining that might represent early endosomes. There was very little colocalization of the two proteins indicated by the almost complete absence of yellow staining. The construct MPR-W19A was localized partially in lysosomes as indicated by an increased colabeling with Lamp1 compared with the CD-MPR wild-type (Fig. 1B). The amount of colabeling with Lamp1 was even further increased for the mutant MPR-W19D, demonstrating that a large percentage of this construct was delivered from endosomes to lysosomes instead of being recycled back to the TGN. Interestingly, although residing within the same structures the fluorescent signal for the CD-MPR mutant constructs was sometimes not filling the entire structure (Fig. 1, B and C, insets; yellow and green staining). Such a partial segregation would suggest distinct domains on continuous membranes.These results demonstrate that the mutant receptors are not correctly sorted from the late endosomes back to the TGN and therefore accumulate in lysosomes. It also seems that the extent of missorting to lysosomes depends on the properties of the amino acid replacing Trp19 but this has to be characterized in more detail using a biochemical assay.Hydrophobic Residues Poorly Replace Aromatic Residues at Position 19 in the CD-MPR Cytoplasmic Tail to Bind Tip47 inVitro—The immunofluorescence experiments suggested that the physical properties of the amino acid replacing Trp19 determines the sorting efficiency of the CD-MPR mutants in late endosomes. Tip47 was shown to interact specifically with the di-aromatic motif of the MPRs and to mediate the transport from endosomes back to the TGN (17Diaz E. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 433-443Google Scholar). Therefore we wanted to test the interaction of various CD-MPR mutants with Tip47 using an in vitro binding assay. Because of the potential effect of post-translational modifications we used the full-length receptor expressed in mammalian cells in contrast to previously published assays with truncated fusion proteins produced in E. coli. For this purpose we created a series of receptor constructs that consist of the full-length CD-MPR with various mutations of the residue Trp19 (Fig. 2). Besides the replacements of Trp19 with the bulky hydrophobic residues (Val, Ile, and Leu) we also used a less hydrophobic amino acid with a nonpolar side chain (Ala) as well as an amino acid with an uncharged polar side chain (Ser) or charged polar side chains (Arg and Asp). Post-nuclear supernatant from wild-type and mutant receptors expressed in mouse D9 (LRec–) cells were incubated with His-tagged Tip47 bound to nickel beads and bound receptor was subsequently detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The mouse monoclonal antibody 22D4 used to detect the bound CD-MPR does not recognize the endogenous receptor in mouse D9 cells and reacts only with transfected bovine receptor (23Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Google Scholar). The antibody recognizes two bands of the CD-MPR, the upper one at 67 kDa being a dimeric form of the receptor as shown previously (23Rohrer J. Kornfeld R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1623-1631Google Scholar). Tip47 bound the wild-type receptor with an affinity greater than all the mutant constructs not containing a di-aromatic motif (Fig. 3A). The di-aromatic constructs MPR-FW-YF and MPR-W19Y bound Tip47 as well as the wild-type receptor. There was a modest decrease in binding of Tip47 to constructs MPR-W19V, MPR-W19I, and MPR-W19L indicating that hydrophobic residues replacing Trp19 do not completely abolish the interaction with Tip47. Binding barely above background was seen when Trp19 was replaced either by alanine (MPR-W19A) or serine (MPR-W19S). Similarly, binding barely above background was detected when charged residues like aspartic acid or arginine were used to replace Trp19. These data indicate that the hydrophobic residues, leucine, isoleucine, and valine alone are partially able to replace Trp19 in an in vitro Tip47 binding assay.Fig. 2Schematic illustration of the wild-type and mutant CD-MPR constructs. The bovine CD-MPR lumenal domain in each construct is indicated by a striated bar followed by an open bar (transmembrane domain) and a solid line (cytoplasmic tail). The di-aromatic signal is shown in single letter code and residues replacing Trp19 are indicated by bold letters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3A, interaction in vitro between wild-type and mutant CD-MPR constructs with Tip47. Ni-CAM beads blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with His6-Tip47 were incubated with either wild-type or mutant receptors in post-nuclear supernatant of mouse D9 cells for 2 h at 4 °C and washed three times to remove unbound proteins. Beads alone represents the negative control for the assay done by incubating wild-type receptor with beads without Tip47. Bound receptor was detected using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-CD-MPR antibody. Protein standard shows molecular mass in kDa (Amersham Biosciences). B, quantitation of binding of mutant receptors to His6-Tip47 relative to wild-type receptor. Results shown are the S.E. ± mean values from eight independent experiments. Binding of wild-type receptor was normalized to 100%. The binding efficiency of the assay was determined to be more than 20%. Quantitation was performed by densitometric scanning followed by ImageQuant 5.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Replacement of Trp19 by Hydrophobic Residues Prevents Moderately the Delivery of the Mutant Receptors to Lysosomes— Because the Tip47 binding assay was performed in vitro with Tip47 in the context of a His-tagged fusion protein isolated from E. coli, an additional assay was performed to analyze the efficiency of mutant constructs to avoid lysosomal delivery in vivo. Mouse L cells stably expressing the wild-type and mutant receptors were preincubated for 24 h in the presence of pepstatin A and leupeptin to inhibit degradation of receptors that had entered lysosomes (22Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Google Scholar). The cells were then harvested, homogenized, and the lysosomes were separated on 17.5% isoosmotic Percoll density gradients (22Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Google Scholar, 26Green S.A. Zimmer K.P. Griffiths G. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1227-1240Google Scholar). Under these conditions, dense lysosomes are recovered at the bottom of the gradient (pool I), whereas low density membranes including endosomes, Golgi apparatus, plasma membrane, and endoplasmic reticulum are found near the top of the gradient (pool III). Intermediate density membranes are recovered in pool II. The distribution of the receptor in the three pools was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting (Fig. 4 and Table I for quantitation of multiple experiments). As reported previously, the wild-type CD-MPR was almost completely excluded from dense lysosomes (5% recovered in pool I) and replacement of the di-aromatic motif (Phe18-Trp19) with other aromatic residues did not affect the distribution significantly (MPR-FF, 5%; MPR-FY, 4%; MPR-YF, 8%; and MPR YW, 3%) (10Schweizer A. Kornfeld S. Rohrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14471-14476Google Scholar). Substitution of Trp19 with bulky hydrophobic residues led to an accumulation of the mutant receptors in dense lysosomes to about 30% (MPR-W19V, 27%; MPR-W19I, 27%; and MPR-W19L, 29%). A slightly larger accumulation of mutant receptors in lysosomes was found with the mutants that contained less hydrophobic, nonpolar side chains as replacements for Trp19 (MPR-W19A, 38%; and MPR-W19M, 40%). To our surprise we found that the mutant MPR-W19C with the polar s"

The mechanism by which the lethality of DNA damage is mitigated is unknown but seems not to involve the direct reversal of damage, excision repair, conventional recombination repair, or translesion synthesis. Here we explore the hypothesis that the mechanism involves a switch in DNA primer extension from the cognate template to an alternative template, the just-synthesized daughter strand of the other parental strand. The activities of the mutant proteins are reduced about 2-fold (for gp32) or 4-fold (for gp41) in replication complexes catalyzing coordinated synthesis of leading and lagging strands, in binding single-stranded DNA, promoting DNA annealing, and promoting branch migration. In striking contrast, the mutant proteins are strongly impaired in promoting template switching, thus supporting the hypothesis of survival by template switching."
https://openalex.org/W2117891523,"Srp40p is a nonessential yeast nucleolar protein proposed to function as a chaperone for over 100 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles that are required for rRNA maturation. To verify and expand on its function, genetic screens were performed for the identification of genes that were lethal when mutated in a SRP40 null background (srp40Δ). Unexpectedly, mutation of both cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHM2) and one-carbon tetrahydrofolate synthase (ADE3) was required to achieve synthetic lethality with srp40Δ. Shm2p and Ade3p are cytoplasmic enzymes producing 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate in convergent pathways as the primary source for cellular one-carbon groups. Nonetheless, point mutants of Shm2p that were catalytically inactive (i.e. failed to rescue the methionine auxotrophy of a shm2Δ ade3 strain) complemented the synthetic lethal phenotype, thus revealing a novel metabolism-independent function of Shm2p. The same Shm2p mutants exacerbated a giant cell phenotype observed in the shm2Δ ade3 strain suggesting a catalysis-independent role for Shm2p in cell size control, possibly through regulation of ribosome biogenesis via SRP40. Additionally, we show that the Sm-like protein Lsm5p, which as part of Lsm complexes participates in cytosolic and nuclear RNA processing and degradation pathways, is a multicopy suppressor of the synthetic lethality and of the specific depletion of box H/ACA small nucleolar RNAs from the srp40Δ shm2 ade3 strain. Finally, rat Nopp140 restored growth and stability of box H/ACA snoRNAs after genetic depletion of SRP40 in the synthetic lethal strain indicating that it is indeed the functional homolog of yeast Srp40p."
