Zhou et al. studied the decomposition of ammonia to hydrogen on a copper alloy nanostructure that absorbed light and generated electrons that activated nitrogen atoms on ruthenium surface atoms (see the Perspective by Cortés). By measuring reaction rates at different wavelengths, light intensities, and catalyst surface temperatures, the light-induced reduction of the apparent activation barrier was quantified.

Is the same true for forests? Huang et al. report the first results from a large biodiversity experiment in a subtropical forest in China. The study combines many replicates, realistic tree densities, and large plot sizes with a wide range of species richness levels. After 8 years of the experiment, the findings suggest strong positive effects of tree diversity on forest productivity and carbon accumulation. Thus, changing from monocultures to more mixed forests could benefit both restoration of biodiversity and mitigation of climate change. Science , this issue p. 80"
https://openalex.org/W2894751401,"Seasonal flu by ZIP code Influenza virus strikes communities in northern latitudes during winter, straining health care provision almost to the breaking point. Change in environmental humidity is a key driver, but many other seasonal and social factors contribute. Dalziel et al. obtained a geographical distribution of doctor visits for influenza-like illness for more than 600 U.S. cities (see the Perspective by Wallinga). Some ZIP codes regularly experienced sharply defined peaks of cases, or intense epidemics, and others showed a longer, more diffuse influenza season. The surges tended to occur in smaller cities with less residential density and lower household incomes. Larger, more densely populated cities had more-diffuse epidemics, presumably because of higher rates of personal contact, which makes influenza transmission less subject to climate variation.

https://openalex.org/W2894627923,"Soft structures in nature, such as protein assemblies, can organize reversibly into functional and often hierarchical architectures through noncovalent interactions. Molecularly encoding this dynamic capability in synthetic materials has remained an elusive goal. We report on hydrogels of peptide-DNA conjugates and peptides that organize into superstructures of intertwined filaments that disassemble upon the addition of molecules or changes in charge density. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that this response requires large-scale spatial redistribution of molecules directed by strong noncovalent interactions among them. Simulations also suggest that the chemically reversible structures can only occur within a limited range of supramolecular cohesive energies. Storage moduli of the hydrogels change reversibly as superstructures form and disappear, as does the phenotype of neural cells in contact with these materials."

The sudden emptying of a glacial lake in high-topography regions like the Himalaya can quickly destroy everything in its path. Cook et al. intercepted a GLOF in the Bhotekoshi and Sunkoshi river valleys in central Nepal as they were monitoring the region in the aftermath of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. They found that a massive amount of erosion occurred during the outburst flood, which suggests that GLOFs may be the primary factor in landscape evolution for these regions.

Several cancer types do so by undergoing phenotypic conversion to a highly aggressive cancer called small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC). Whether distinct cancer types accomplish this “reprogramming” through the same mechanism has been unclear. Park et al. show that the same set of oncogenic factors transforms both normal lung and normal prostate epithelial cells into SCNCs that resemble clinical samples (see the Perspective by Kareta and Sage). This convergence of molecular pathways could potentially simplify the development of new therapies for SCNC, which is currently untreatable. Science , this issue p. 91 ; see also p. 30"

https://openalex.org/W2895095363,"During 2017, the Cassini fluxgate magnetometer made in situ measurements of Saturn's magnetic field at distances ~2550 ± 1290 kilometers above the 1-bar surface during 22 highly inclined Grand Finale orbits. These observations refine the extreme axisymmetry of Saturn's internal magnetic field and show displacement of the magnetic equator northward from the planet's physical equator. Persistent small-scale magnetic structures, corresponding to high-degree (>3) axisymmetric magnetic moments, were observed. This suggests secondary shallow dynamo action in the semiconducting region of Saturn's interior. Some high-degree magnetic moments could arise from strong high-latitude concentrations of magnetic flux within the planet's deep dynamo. A strong field-aligned current (FAC) system is located between Saturn and the inner edge of its D-ring, with strength comparable to the high-latitude auroral FACs."
https://openalex.org/W2889792298,"Electron-boson coupling plays a key role in superconductivity for many systems. However, in copper-based high-temperature ($T_c$) superconductors, its relation to superconductivity remains controversial despite strong spectroscopic fingerprints. Here we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to find a striking correlation between the superconducting gap and the bosonic coupling strength near the Brillouin zone boundary in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. The bosonic coupling strength rapidly increases from the overdoped Fermi-liquid regime to the optimally doped strange metal, concomitant with the quadrupled superconducting gap and the doubled gap-to-Tc ratio across the pseudogap boundary. This synchronized lattice and electronic response suggests that the effects of electronic interaction and the electron-phonon coupling become intimately entangled upon entering the strange metal regime, which may in turn drive a stronger superconductivity."

https://openalex.org/W2895365761,"Purpose To evaluate the uncertainty of radiomics features from contrast-enhanced breath-hold helical CT scans of non-small cell lung cancer for both manual and semi-automatic segmentation due to intra-observer, inter-observer, and inter-software reliability. Methods Three radiation oncologists manually delineated lung tumors twice from 10 CT scans using two software tools (3D-Slicer and MIM Maestro). Additionally, three observers without formal clinical training were instructed to use two semi-automatic segmentation tools, Lesion Sizing Toolkit (LSTK) and GrowCut, to delineate the same tumor volumes. The accuracy of the semi-automatic contours was assessed by comparison with physician manual contours using Dice similarity coefficients and Hausdorff distances. Eighty-three radiomics features were calculated for each delineated tumor contour. Informative features were identified based on their dynamic range and correlation to other features. Feature reliability was then evaluated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Feature range was used to evaluate the uncertainty of the segmentation methods. Results From the initial set of 83 features, 40 radiomics features were found to be informative, and these 40 features were used in the subsequent analyses. For both intra-observer and inter-observer reliability, LSTK had higher reliability than GrowCut and the two manual segmentation tools. All observers achieved consistently high ICC values when using LSTK, but the ICC value varied greatly for each observer when using GrowCut and the manual segmentation tools. For inter-software reliability, features were not reproducible across the software tools for either manual or semi-automatic segmentation methods. Additionally, no feature category was found to be more reproducible than another feature category. Feature ranges of LSTK contours were smaller than those of manual contours for all features. Conclusion Radiomics features extracted from LSTK contours were highly reliable across and among observers. With semi-automatic segmentation tools, observers without formal clinical training were comparable to physicians in evaluating tumor segmentation."

https://openalex.org/W2894631113,"This study was initiated to document information on the levels of sediment contamination with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Moreover, it was intended to identify compounds which impose major ecological risks to aquatic organisms. Surficial sediments were collected from 46 locations within the streams and rivers of the Awash River Basin. In total 30 compounds were included in this study: 16 OCPs, 7 PCBs and 7 PBDEs. The total concentrations of OCPs, PCBs, and PBDEs ranged from 6.63 to 206.13 ng g-1- dry weight (dw), 0.85 to 26.56 ng g-1-dw and 3.71 to 18.95 ng g-1-dw respectively. Out of all the tested OCPs, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, p,p′-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p′-DDT) and β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) were the most abundant in the study area. The ratio of (β-HCH/∑HCHs) indicated that HCHs were originally from earlier usage of HCH in the area whereas the ratio of (p,p’-DDT/p,p’-DDE) showed that the majority of DDT components were recently introduced into most of the sampling locations. Even though there were relatively low concentrations of PBDEs and PCBs across the sampling sites, substantial amounts of PCBs were observed in Addis Ababa City. According to the established ecological risk indices, p,p’-DDT and γ-HCH are the major concerns for potential adverse ecological impacts. This study provided the first comprehensive information on organohalogenated compounds’ (OCs’) occurrences, spatial distributions, and ecological risks in sediments of the Awash River Basin. Thus, the report will be very useful background information for further studies on sediment contamination with OCs’ in the region. It also adds important first-hand data to the field of fresh water ecology and provides useful empirical evidence for setting pollution control priorities for an ecologically important, yet largely understudied region."
https://openalex.org/W2894673946,"Background Although performance-enhancing drugs appear to be prevalent in adolescent sports, relatively little attention has been paid to why adolescent athletes decide to use these drugs. In this study, we examine doping among adolescents from a motivational perspective and explore how motivational variables, such as achievement goal orientations and the perceived self-determination of sports activities, may be related to moral attitudes, doping intentions and doping behavior in adolescents who participate in competitive sports. Methodology The study included 1035 adolescents participating in competitive sports from all regions of the Czech Republic (mean age = 16.3 years). The respondents completed a battery of questionnaires assessing their achievement goal orientations (task, ego), sports motivation at various levels of self-determination (intrinsic motivation, external regulation, amotivation), moral attitudes toward sport competition (acceptance of cheating, keeping winning in proportion, attitudes toward doping), doping intentions and doping behavior. A structural equation model was used to test the relations among motivational variables, attitudes, intentions and doping behavior. Principal results Our analyses indicated a good fit with the proposed model, which explained 59% of the variance in doping intentions and 17.6% of the variance in doping behavior. Within the model, task orientation was positively associated with intrinsic motivation and lower amotivation, whereas ego orientation was positively associated with extrinsic regulation and amotivation. Furthermore, intrinsic motivation was positively associated with keeping winning in proportion and negatively associated with acceptance of cheating and attitudes toward doping; the less self-determined forms of motivation showed opposite relationships. However, only the acceptance of cheating and attitudes toward doping were related to doping intention, which subsequently predicted doping behavior. Conclusions/Significance The results provide further evidence that sports motivation represents a psychological variable that should be considered in anti-doping policies, programs, and interventions aimed at the adolescent population because motivation was linked to the doping-related attitudinal variables and also partially mediated the effect of achievement goal orientations in this regard. On the basis of these results, we may argue that the focus on intrinsic enjoyment, self-referenced criteria of success and self-improvement may be related to more negative attitudes toward doping and cheating, lower doping intentions and less frequent doping behavior, whereas the emphasis on competition, comparison with others and external motivation appear to be related to the opposite outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2894909741,"Background Despite the known benefits of a physically active lifestyle, there are few examples of interventions that have been successfully implemented at a population level over a long period of time. One such example is The Daily Mile, a school based physical activity initiative, where a teacher takes their class out daily during class time for a short bout of ambulatory activity. At one school, this activity appears has been sustained over a long period (6 years), has the whole school participating and is now incorporated into its daily routine. The aim of this paper was to understand how The Daily Mile was implemented in primary schools and to assess factors associated with its successful implementation. Methods Semi-structured interviews with school staff who had a significant role in implementing The Daily Mile were conducted at four primary schools in central Scotland. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and descriptive analysis and interpretation of data undertaken. Details regarding the school grounds and facilities were also noted during the interviews. Results Having simple core intervention components, flexible delivery that supports teacher autonomy and being adaptable to suit the specific primary school context appear to be key aspects of The Daily Mile that are related to its implementation success. Other factors relating to how The Daily Mile was developed, trialled and rolled out might also have contributed towards its successful implementation. Conclusion The Daily Mile appears to have several factors which may relate to its implementation success. These are important considerations for others looking to implement The Daily Mile effectively in their primary school or in other contexts."

https://openalex.org/W2763143203,"The mechanisms behind the clearance of soluble waste from deep within the parenchyma of the brain remain unclear. Experimental evidence reveals that one pathway for clearance of waste, termed intra-mural peri-arterial drainage (IPAD), is the rapid drainage of interstitial fluid along basement membranes (BM) of the smooth muscle cells of cerebral arteries; failure of IPAD is closely associated with the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but its driving mechanism remains unclear. We have previously shown that arterial pulsations generated by the heart beat are not strong enough to drive IPAD. Here we present computational evidence for a mechanism for clearance of waste from the brain that is driven by functional hyperaemia, that is, the dilatation of cerebral arterioles as a consequence of increased nutrient demand from neurons. This mechanism is based on our model for the flow of fluid through the vascular BM. It accounts for clearance rates observed in mouse experiments, and aligns with pathological observations and recommendations to lower the individual risk of AD, such as mental and physical activity. Thus, our neurovascular hypothesis should act as the new working hypothesis for the driving force behind IPAD."

Thirty-five patients with non-specific CLBP and 48 healthy participants were recruited. Assessor one administered the FreBAQ-G to each patient with CLBP on two separate days to quantify intra-observer reliability. Assessor two administered the FreBaQ-G to each patient on day 1. The scores were compared to those obtained by assessor one on day 1 to assess inter-observer reliability. Known-groups validity was quantified by comparing the FreBAQ-G score between patients and healthy controls. To assess convergent validity, patient's FreBAQ-G scores were correlated to their two-point discrimination (TPD) scores.Intra- and Inter-observer reliability were both moderate with ICC3.1 = 0.88 (95%CI: 0.77 to 0.94) and 0.89 (95%CI: 0.79 to 0.94), respectively. Intra- and inter-observer limits of agreement (LoA) were 6.2 (95%CI: 5.0-8.1) and 6.0 (4.8-7.8), respectively.

Northern dawn-side, narrow-banded radio sources were encountered at frequencies of 10 to 20 kilohertz, within regions of upward currents mapping to the ultraviolet auroral oval. The kilometric waves were produced on the extraordinary mode by the cyclotron maser instability from 6- to 12-kilo-electron volt electron beams and radiated quasi-perpendicularly to the auroral magnetic field lines.

Although it is well known that after oral antigen administration specific germinal centres are not only formed in the Peyers patches (PP) and the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) but also in the spleen, there is still a lack of functional data showing a direct involvement of splenic B cells in an IgA immune response in the gut. In addition, after removal of mLN a high level of IgA+ B cells was observed in the gut. Therefore, in this study we analysed the role of the spleen in the induction of IgA+ B cells in the gut after mice were orally challenged with antigens. Here we have shown that antigen specific splenic IgM+ B cells after in vitro antigen stimulation as well as oral immunisation of donor mice were able to migrate into the gut of recipient mice, where they predominantly switch to IgA+ plasma cells. Furthermore, stimulation of recipient mice by orally administered antigens enhanced the migration of the splenic B cells into the gut as well as their switch to IgA+ plasma cells. Removal of the mLN led to a higher activation level of the splenic B cells. Altogether, our results imply that splenic IgM+ B cells migrate in the intestinal lamina propria, where they differentiate into IgA+ plasma cells and subsequently proliferate. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the spleen plays a major role in the gut immune response serving as a reservoir of immune cells that migrate to the site of antigen entrance."

https://openalex.org/W2894740271,"Heart failure is a common, costly, and potentially fatal condition. The cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2a) plays a critical role in the regulation of cardiac function. Previously, low SERCA2a expression was revealed in mice with heart failure. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) can function as an epigenetic regulator and has been reported to enhance cardiac function. However, the underlying epigenetic regulatory mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we investigated whether EGCG can up-regulate SERCA2a via histone acetylation and play role in preventing heart failure. For this, we generated a mouse model of heart failure by performing a minimally invasive transverse aortic constriction (TAC) operation and used this to test the effects of EGCG. The TAC+EGCG group showed nearly normal cardiac function compared to that in the SHAM group. The expression of SERCA2a was decreased at both the mRNA and protein levels in the TAC group but was enhanced in the TAC+EGCG group. Levels of AcH3 and AcH3K9 were determined to decrease near the promoter region of Atp2a2 (the gene encoding SERCA-2a) in the TAC group, but were elevated in the TAC+EGCG group. Meanwhile, HDAC1 activity and binding near the Atp2a2 promoter were increased in the TAC group but decreased with EGCG addition. Further, binding levels of GATA4 and Mef2c near the Atp2a2 promoter region were reduced in TAC hearts, which might have been caused by histone hypoacetylation; this was reversed by EGCG. Together, upregulation of SERCA2a via the modification of histone acetylation plays a role in EGCG-mediated prevention of pressure overload-induced heart failure, and this might represent a novel pharmacological target for the treatment of heart failure."

These mechanistic details provide detailed insight into the regulation of PAH activation and provide testable hypotheses for the development of new allosteric effectors to correct structural and functional defects in PAH. Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) regulates phenylalanine (Phe) levels in mammals to prevent neurotoxicity resulting from high Phe concentrations as observed in genetic disorders leading to hyperphenylalaninemia and phenylketonuria. PAH senses elevated Phe concentrations by transient allosteric Phe binding to a protein–protein interface between ACT domains of different subunits in a PAH tetramer.

EC 1.14.16.1) functions in humans to control free phenylalanine (Phe), an essential amino acid that is neurotoxic at elevated levels. Failure to control Phe, most often due to defects in PAH, results in hyperphenylalaninemia or phenylketonuria (PKU), which is the most common inborn error of amino acid metabolism. PAH catalyzes the conversion of Phe to tyrosine at the enzyme active site but also binds Phe at an allosteric site that sits at a subunit–subunit interface of a PAH tetramer. This intersubunit interface, which is present in activated PAH (A-PAH) and absent in resting-state PAH (RS-PAH), lies between ACT subdomains located diagonally across the tetramer (Fig. 1, a and b). ACT domains, which can serve in ligand sensing, were named for the first three proteins in which they were identified (1Aravind L. Koonin E.V.

The homology model was constructed using monomeric rat PAH (rPAH; see Fig. S1 for sequence comparison) ACT domain (PDB code 1PHZ) as a template with the dimeric form modeled by threading onto the ACT domain dimer from phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PDB code 1PSD).

This conformation differs from the Phe-bound crystal structure (PDB code 5FII) by having a helical turn at residues 61–64 (e.g. PDB code 5DEN), which, when overlaid on the Phe-bound ACT domain dimer structure, fills the cavity of the allosteric Phe-binding site. The homology model and the crystal structure also differ in their β-strand register at the dimer interface. Molecular simulations of the homology model and crystal structure, in monomeric and dimeric forms and in the presence and absence of Phe, offer valuable insights into the Phe binding mechanism not available by other methods. Whereas previous experimental studies have estimated binding equilibria for Phe to the preformed ACT domain dimer (8Zhang S. Roberts K.M. Fitzpatrick P.F. Phenylalanine binding is linked to dimerization of the regulatory domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase.Biochemistry. 2014; 53 (25299136): 6625-662710.1021/bi501109sCrossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), simulations can provide estimates of Phe binding pathways and rates crucial to understanding the molecular mechanism of allosteric activation (9Gu S.

In particular, because the putative unliganded homology model represents an alternative dimer conformation where the monomers are very close to the RS-PAH conformation, ab initio binding simulations can distinguish between conformational selection versus induced fit ligand binding mechanisms. Moreover, the conformational motions seen in molecular simulations can be used to understand the effects of mutations and to generate testable hypotheses about alternative conformational states that could be targeted by allosteric effectors (15Bowman G.R. Bolin E.R. Hart K.M. Maguire B.C. Marqusee S. Discovery of multiple hidden allosteric sites by combining Markov state models and experiments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015; (201417811)Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Until now, only submicrosecond simulations of the ACT domain monomer in the absence of Phe have been performed (16Carluccio C. Fraternali F. Salvatore F. Fornili A. Zagari A. Structural features of the regulatory ACT domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase.PLoS One. 2013; 8 (24244510): e79413-e7948210.1371/journal.pone.0079482Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here, ∼633 μs of trajectory data obtained from parallel explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations were performed and analyzed to elucidate 1) the conformational dynamics of the ACT domain monomer, 2) the conformational dynamics of Phe-binding encounter complexes of the ACT domain dimer, and 3) pathways and rates of Phe binding to ACT domain dimer conformations. As described below, Markov state model analysis of the trajectory data implicates a conformational selection mechanism for Phe association with ACT domain dimers and reveals key conformational motions coupled to Phe binding. One of these motions corresponds to a ligand gating mechanism, whereas another reflects mobility in a hairpin loop region. Experimental measurements on PAH with a bulky amino acid substitution in this region do not show a shift in the RS-PAH to A-PAH equilibrium, corroborating the role of flexibility in the hairpin loop. Multiple independent methods were used to estimate Phe binding rates to the preformed regulatory ACT domain dimer poses: 1) the distribution of observed binding times, 2) the numbers of binding events, 3) implied timescales from Markov state models, and 4) binding flux estimates from transition path theory (TPT). Bayesian inference was used to estimate the rate of free Phe binding to an ACT domain dimer from the distribution of binding times. Given N observed binding events, each with an observed time to binding ti, i = 1, …, N, each binding time ti was assumed to come from a Poisson distribution, P(t|k) = k exp(−kt), for some unknown binding rate, k. The likelihood of observing the data given the rate k is P(t1, t2, …, tN|k) = Πi P(ti|k) = kN exp(−k∑iti). By Bayes’ theorem, the posterior probability of the value of k, given the observed binding times ti, is P(k|t1, t2, …, tN) ∝ P(t1, t2, …, tN|k) P(k) where P(k) is a prior distribution. Two common choices were considered for the prior distribution: the uniform distribution (P(k) ∼ 1) and the noninformative Jeffreys prior (P(k) ∼ 1/k). Using the N = 29 observed binding times (Table S4), the maximum posterior probability yields an estimate of k = 6.28 × 107 s−1 m−1 (95% confidence interval, 4.63–8.50 × 107 s−1 m−1) for uniform prior and k = 6.03 × 107 s−1 m−1 (95% confidence interval, 4.65–8.54 × 107 s−1 m−1) using a Jeffreys prior (Fig. S10). As described in Shirts and Pande (17Shirts M.R. Pande V.S. Mathematical analysis of coupled parallel simulations.Phys. Rev. Lett. 2001; 86 (11384401): 4983-498710.1103/PhysRevLett.86.4983Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), simulating M parallel trajectories of a Poisson process results in a probability of observing a binding event after time t is given by PM(t) = Mk exp(−Mkt). Therefore, for a collection of trajectories of different lengths, the expected number of binding events 〈n〉 is 〈n〉(k) = ∫M(t)k exp(−M(t)kt)dt where M(t) is the number of trajectories that reach a length of t (18Voelz V.A. Bowman G.R. Beauchamp K. Pande V.S. Molecular simulation of ab initio protein folding for a millisecond folder NTL9(1–39).J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132 (20070076): 1526-152810.1021/ja9090353Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Because the analysis suggests that only crystal-like ACT domain dimer poses are competent for binding (see Fig. 1g), a subset of trajectory data corresponding to crystal-like dimer poses was analyzed (starting conformations 0–9; Fig. S11). The 29 binding events that were observed (assuming ±5.2 from binomial finite sampling error) corresponds to rates in the range of 2–6 × 107 s−1 m−1 (Fig. S12). The slowest MSM implied timescale, τ1 = 256 ± 65 ns, corresponds to Phe binding (see Fig. 2 and Fig. S6). The observed relaxation rate corresponding to two-state binding is therefore kobs = kon + koff = 1/cτ1 where c = 99.52 mm is the effective concentration of Phe in the simulations. Because koff ≪ kon, the estimated binding rate is kon = 1/cτ1 = 3.9 × 107 s−1 m−1. A bootstrap estimate of standard error in (ln τ1) yields upper and lower estimates of 5.1 and 3.0 × 107 s−1 m−1, respectively. Of the 480 trajectories generated, 29 independent Phe binding events were observed (Movie S1). Binding was monitored using the average distance between the Phe ligand and three residues that show close contact to the Phe ligands in the Phe-bound ACT domain dimer crystal structure: Leu48, Leu62, and Ile65 (Fig. 1c). From the distribution of observed binding times (Table S4), a binding rate of 6 × 107 s−1 m−1 to the ACT domain dimer is inferred (Fig. 1d). This value is corroborated by estimates from the number of binding events and MSM-based rate estimates (Table 1).Table 1Estimates of binding rates of free Phe to the preformed ACT domain dimerMethodRateaThe average of all methods is 5 ± 3 × 107 s−1 m−1.Uncertainty (lower–upper bound)(× 107 s−1 m−1)Binding time distributionUniform prior6.284.63–8.50Jeffreys prior6.034.65–8.54Numbers of binding events4.02.0–6.0MSM implied timescales3.93.0–5 .1Transition path theory6.01.0–6 .3a The average of all methods is 5 ± 3 × 107 s−1 m−1. Open table in a new tab Physiologically, the estimated binding rate is slower than the theoretical diffusion limit (∼109 s−1 m−1) in the range typical for small molecules binding to protein targets (19Pang X.

For comparison, the experimentally measured binding rate of benzamidine (similar in size to Phe) to trypsin is ∼2.9 × 107 s−1 m−1 (21Guillain F. Thusius D. Use of proflavine as an indicator in temperature-jump studies of the binding of a competitive inhibitor to trypsin.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92 (5449454): 5534-553610.1021/ja00721a051Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It should be kept in mind that our rate estimate reflects the binding rate to the preformed ACT domain dimer and that ACT domain dimerization would likely limit the rate of PAH activation at high Phe concentrations. Sample binding traces are shown in Fig. 1, e and f. Of the 29 binding events, all but one are found in trajectories started from poses resembling the liganded crystal structure (Fig. 1g). The lone exception is found in a trajectory for which an unliganded homology model–like dimer pose first transitions to a more crystal structure–like pose before Phe binds (Fig. 1, f and h, orange trace). This dimer pose may still be suboptimal for binding because unbinding is later observed. No unbinding events are observed in the 28 other binding trajectories or in any of the simulations starting from the Phe-bound crystal structure (PDB code 5FII). The absence of simulated unbinding events is consistent with estimates of unbinding rates. Zhang et al. (8Zhang S. Roberts K.M. Fitzpatrick P.F. Phenylalanine binding is linked to dimerization of the regulatory domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase.Biochemistry. 2014; 53 (25299136): 6625-662710.1021/bi501109sCrossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have used analytic ultracentrifugation to estimate a dissociation constant (Kd) of 8.3 μm for each Phe molecule’s association to an ACT domain dimer. Using our estimated kon value, this implies a Phe dissociation rate koff = kon/Kd of about 500 s−1 and would suggest that millisecond-timescale trajectories would be required to observe unbinding, whereas our longest trajectories are around 1 μs. To visualize the conformational dynamics of the collection of ACT domain dimer poses seen in the ab initio binding trajectories, time-structure–based independent component analysis (tICA) was performed to project trajectory coordinates to a low-dimensional subspace representing the slowest motions of the dimers. The largest tICA component (tIC1) shows slow interconversion between crystal structure–like and homology model–like dimer poses, whereas the next largest component (tIC2) shows motions corresponding to ACT domain dimer dissociation (Fig. 1h). Dimer dissociation is not seen for crystal structure–like poses. Despite the numerous interactions between free Phe and the ACT domain dimer poses in the simulations, both ligand binding and dimer association are found to be highly dependent on the dimer pose. This finding suggests a conformational selection mechanism of Phe binding whereby formation of a binding-competent dimer is required before association of Phe; in other words, the formation of the bound dimer is not a Phe-induced conformational change. Simulations of an ACT domain dimer in high concentrations of Phe additionally provide a detailed picture of Phe-binding hot spots on the dimer surface other than the allosteric Phe-binding site. Significant binding propensity between free Phe and Phe80 (Fig. S13) is observed, which is intriguing because a somewhat buried Phe80 of RS-PAH participates in stabilizing that subunit conformation through cation–π interactions with arginine residues on both the catalytic and multimerization domains on the same subunit (6Arturo E.C. Gupta K. Héroux A. Stith L. Cross P.J. Parker E.J. Loll P.J. Jaffe E.K. First structure of full-length mammalian phenylalanine hydroxylase reveals the architecture of an autoinhibited tetramer.Proc.

Further analysis, however, suggests that the observed binding propensity arises mainly from the high concentration of free Phe used in the simulations; on- and off-rates suggest low overall affinity between free Phe and Phe80 of the ACT domain dimer (Kd ∼ 200 mm; see supporting methods, Fig. S14, and Table S5). Note that Phe80, which is on the eight-stranded β-sheet of the ACT domain dimer, is predicted to be facing inward toward the C-terminal four-helix bundle of the A-PAH tetramer model (refer to Fig. 1b). Simulations of the ACT dimer poses in the absence of Phe show dimer dissociation for homology-like dimer poses but not for crystal structure–like poses (Fig. 1h). This finding is consistent with significant in vitro data on the isolated PAH ACT domain that suggest spontaneous dimer formation in the absence of Phe and the stabilization of this dimer in the presence of Phe (8Zhang S. Roberts K.M. Fitzpatrick P.F. Phenylalanine binding is linked to dimerization of the regulatory domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase.Biochemistry. 2014; 53 (25299136): 6625-662710.1021/bi501109sCrossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Zhang S.

Other studies show that although full-length RS-PAH in the absence of Phe samples both tetramer and dimer, the addition of Phe favors a stable tetramer (presumably A-PAH) (3Jaffe E.K. Stith L. Lawrence S.H. Andrake M. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. A new model for allosteric regulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase: implications for disease and therapeutics.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2013; 530 (23296088): 73-8210.1016/j.abb.2012.12.017Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of Phe binding to the ACT domain dimer, MSMs of the conformational dynamics associated with binding using the coordinates of Phe ligands and the protein residues surrounding a single binding site were constructed (see “Experimental procedures” and supporting information). Before doing this, however, the possibility of any Phe-binding cooperativity was probed by building MSMs of both binding sites in the Phe-bound dimer (PDB code 5FII). The results suggest that conformational dynamics in each binding site are independent of each other (data not shown). Binding statistics also support noncooperative Phe binding to the preformed dimer: of the 29 binding events observed in 480 trajectories, two of those 29 trajectories show double Phe binding events (Fig. S15), consistent with a ∼6% independent probability of observing binding for each site (29/480 ≈ 2/29). Consistent with this result are experimental measurements of Phe-dependent ACT domain dimerization in which the model that best fit sedimentation data was the one with identical and independent Phe binding to the preformed ACT domain dimer (8Zhang S. Roberts K.M. Fitzpatrick P.F. Phenylalanine binding is linked to dimerization of the regulatory domain of phenylalanine hydroxylase.Biochemistry. 2014; 53 (25299136): 6625-662710.1021/bi501109sCrossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as well as isothermal titration calorimetry studies of the truncated ACT dimer (7Meisburger S.P. Taylor A.B. Khan C.A. Zhang S. Fitzpatrick P.F. Ando N. Domain movements upon activation of phenylalanine hydroxylase characterized by crystallography and chromatography-coupled small-angle X-ray scattering.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016; 138 (27145334): 6506-651610.1021/jacs.6b01563Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We then proceeded to construct an MSM of 75 metastable conformational states for Phe ligands and protein residues surrounding a single binding site. The results reveal structural intermediates along the Phe binding pathway coupled to protein dynamics (Fig. 2). The tICA projections show that the slowest-timescale motions are coupled to binding events with the most significant changes in interresidue distances corresponding to residues that gate the entry of Phe (Glu44/Val45 and Asp59/Val60/Asn61) (Fig. 2, blue). Strikingly, the MSM shows that the protein loop containing Val45 must swing open to allow access to the binding site. In all binding trajectories, this gate must open before binding can occur. Once the ligand is bound, the gate closes, helping to stabilize the bound state. More details describing this motion can be found in Table S6 and Figs. S16 and S17. In the absence of free Phe, the slowest two motions of the dimer are also found to occur within the same area that functions as the binding gate for Phe binding (Table S7 and Fig. S18). This suggests that this intrinsic motion is independent of Phe concentration, again consistent with conformational selection. The next-slowest conformational motion corresponds to bending of the hairpin loop containing Leu72 (Fig. 2, magenta). Although this motion occurs on a timescale (∼100 ns) similar to that of binding, it does not appear coupled to binding; binding occurs regardless of whether the hairpin loop is bent. Using transition path theory, it is estimated that about 8% of binding flux occurs through bent-hairpin pathways (Fig. S8). The mobility of this hairpin loop helps explain a number of experimental observations. First, in the crystal structure of the Phe-bound ACT domain dimer (PDB code 5FII), Leu72 is unresolved in one of the four chains, indicative of high mobility. Second, hydrogen/deuterium exchange studies on full-length rPAH (25Li J. Dangott L.J. Fitzpatrick P.F. Regulation of phenylalanine hydroxylase: conformational changes upon phenylalanine binding detected by hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry.Biochemistry. 2010; 49 (20307070): 3327-333510.1021/bi1001294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) showed that a peptide containing residues 67–81, which includes a significant portion of the β-strands on either side of the hairpin loop containing Leu72, displays modest hydrogen/deuterium exchange. There is no difference in hydrogen/deuterium exchange for the peptide in the absence or presence of 5 mm Phe, which is consistent with the prediction from the current molecular dynamics simulations that the hairpin loop’s mobility is inherent to the structure and not dependent on Phe binding. To investigate the mobility of the hairpin loop region, the L72W variant of the rat protein was prepared and tested for the robustness of the RS-PAH ⇔ A-PAH structural equilibrium. In the full-length crystal structure of rat RS-PAH (6Arturo E.C. Gupta K. Héroux A. Stith L. Cross P.J. Parker E.J. Loll P.J. Jaffe E.K.

In this study, 105 strains of V. parahaemolyticus were isolated from fresh seafood in 2013 and 2014. The serotypes, virulence-associated genes and sequence types (STs) of these strains were analyzed. 26 defined serotypes were identified and 69 strains (65.7%) had untypeable O or K antigen. 8 strains (7.6%) had the virulence-associated gene tdh and no strain carried the trh gene. 45.7% (48/105) of isolates contained all four T3SS1 genes and 50% (4/8) tdh+ trh- V. parahaemolyticus isolates lacked at least one of the four tested T3SS2α genes. 105 strains could be categorized into 84 STs and only 3 STs (ST3, ST8, ST675) had appeared in clinical strains. V. parahaemolyticus strains from seafood have more diverse and untypeable serotypes, less virulence-associated genes and more STs than strains from clinical sources."

The Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) is a validated HRQL questionnaire, yet a validated German version of the LCQ is not available and it has never been tested in a cohort with sarcoidosis.To translate the LCQ into German and determine its psychometric properties.The LCQ was translated in a forward-backward approach. Structured interviews in sarcoidosis patients were performed. Subsequently, sarcoidosis patients were asked to answer the German LCQ and comparative questionnaires. Distribution properties, item difficulty, concurrent validity, Rasch model fit and internal consistency of the German LCQ were determined.200 patients with sarcoidosis were included. We provide evidence for reliability, unidimensionality and internal consistency. However, only a moderate correlation with general and respiratory-specific HRQL questionnaires, no Rasch model fit could be shown. Skewed responses caused by floor effects were detected.We demonstrate that the German LCQ is valid and reliable and its psychometric properties fulfil the standards required for its use in clinical settings as well as in interventional trials."
https://openalex.org/W2894919122,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is genetically diverse and includes 7 genotypes and 67 confirmed subtypes, and the global distribution of each HCV genotype (GT) varies by geographic region. In this report, we utilized a large dataset of NS3/4A and NS5A sequences isolated from 2348 HCV GT1-6-infected patients treated with the regimen containing glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) to assess genetic diversity within HCV subtypes by geographic region using phylogenetic analyses, and evaluated the prevalence of baseline amino acid polymorphisms in NS3 and NS5A by region/country and phylogenetic cluster. Among 2348 NS3/4A and NS5A sequences, phylogenetic analysis identified 6 genotypes and 44 subtypes, including 3 GT1, 8 GT2, 3 GT3, 13 GT4, 1 GT5, and 16 GT6 subtypes. Phylogenetic analysis of HCV subtype 1a confirmed the presence of two clades, which differed by geographic region distribution and NS3 Q80K prevalence. We detected phylogenetic clustering by country in HCV subtypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 5a, suggesting that genetically distinct virus lineages are circulating in different countries. In addition, two clades were detected in HCV GT4a and GT6e, and NS5A amino acid polymorphisms were differentially distributed between the 2 clades in each subtype. The prevalence of NS3 and NS5A baseline polymorphisms varied substantially by genotype and subtype; therefore, we also determined the activity of GLE or PIB against replicons containing NS3/4A or NS5A from HCV GT1-6 clinical samples representing 6 genotypes and 21 subtypes overall. GLE and PIB retained activity against the majority of HCV replicons containing NS3/4A or NS5A from HCV GT1-6 clinical samples, with a median EC50 of 0.29 nM for GLE and 1.1 pM for PIB in a transient replicon assay. The data presented in this report expands the available data on HCV epidemiology, subtype diversity by geographic region, and NS3 and NS5A baseline polymorphism prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W2895282198,"Purpose This study aimed to compare the inverse planning simulated annealing (IPSA) stochastic algorithm with the hybrid inverse planning and optimization (HIPO) algorithm for interstitial tongue high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Methods Twenty patients who received radiotherapy for tongue cancer using interstitial HDR brachytherapy were retrospectively selected for this study. Oncentra Brachy v. 4.3 was used for IPSA and HIPO planning. Four to eight fixed catheter configurations were determined according to the target shape. During the optimization process, predetermined constrain values were used for each IPSA and HIPO plan. The dosimetric parameters and dwell time were analyzed to evaluate the performances of the plans. Results The total dwell time using IPSA was 4 seconds longer than that of HIPO. The number of active positions per catheter for the IPSA plans were approximately 2.5 fewer than those of the HIPO plans. The dose-volumetric parameters related to the clinical target volume with IPSA were lower than those with HIPO. In terms of the dose-volumetric parameters related to normal tissue, HIPO tended to associate with slightly higher values than IPSA, without statistical significance. After GrO, the target coverages were satisfied to clinical goal for all patients. The total dwell times was approximately increased by 10%. Conclusions The IPSA and HIPO dose optimization algorithms generate similar dosimetric results. In terms of the dwell time, HIPO appears to be more beneficial."

The impact of T. whipplei colonization in the lung on local inflammation and pulmonary dysfunction in HIV-infected individuals is currently unknown. In this study, we performed specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing for T. whipplei in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and induced sputum (IS) samples in 76 HIV-infected participants from three clinical sites. Pulmonary function and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in BAL were measured. Frequency of T. whipplei in either BAL or IS was 43.4%. The sensitivity and specificity of IS compared to BAL for detection of T. whipplei was 92.3% and 84.2%, respectively, and isolates of T. whipplei in the BAL and IS in the same subject shared genetic identity. Pulmonary function measures were not associated with T. whipplei colonization, and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in BAL and plasma as well as percentages of inflammatory cells in BAL and IS were not higher in colonized individuals. Overall, these results indicate that T. whipplei colonization in the lung is common, but may not be associated with decreased pulmonary function or inflammation in HIV-infected individuals."

This conserved catalytic mechanism suggests that NEDD4-2, and presumably all HECT ligases, requires oligomerization to catalyze polyubiquitin chain assembly. To explore this hypothesis, we examined the catalytic mechanism of NEDD4-2 through the use of biochemically defined kinetic assays examining rates of 125I-labeled polyubiquitin chain assembly and biophysical techniques. The results from gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light-scattering analyses demonstrate for the first time that active NEDD4-2 is a trimer. Homology modeling to E6AP revealed that the predicted intersubunit interface has an absolutely conserved Phe-823, substitution of which destabilized the trimer and resulted in a ≥104-fold decrease in kcat for polyubiquitin chain assembly. The small-molecule Phe-823 mimic, N-acetylphenylalanyl-amide, acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor (Ki = 8 ± 1.2 mm) of polyubiquitin chain elongation by destabilizing the active trimer, suggesting a mechanism for therapeutically targeting HECT ligases.

In this model, the cognate E2∼ubiquitin co-substrate binds to a single site at the small N-terminal subdomain of the HECT catalytic module prior to transthiolation to the HECT active-site cysteine, suggested by the crystal structure of the isolated E6AP HECT domain in complex with UbcH7 solved by Huang et al.

https://openalex.org/W2895301426,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is known to induce autophagosome accumulation as observed by the typical punctate cytoplasmic distribution of LC3B-II in infected cells. Previously, we showed that viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) interacts with ATG5, a major component of the autophagy elongation complex that is involved in the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMV), and demonstrated that the autophagy elongation complex (ATG5-12/16L1) but not LC3B is required for proper membranous web formation. In this study, the colocalization and in situ interaction of all HCV replicase components with the constituent of the autophagy elongation complex and LC3B were analyzed. The results clearly show the recruitment of the elongation complex to the site of viral replication. Using in situ proximity ligation assay, we show that ATG5, but not ATG16L1, interacts with several HCV replicase components suggesting that the recruitment is directed via the ATG5-12 conjugate. Interestingly, no E3-like conjugation activity of ATG5-12/16L1 can be detected at the at HCV replication site since LC3B-II is not found along with the elongation complex at the site of viral replication. In agreement with this result, no sign of in situ interaction of LC3B with the replicase components is observed. Finally, using dominant negative forms of ATG proteins, we demonstrate that ATG5-12 conjugate, but not LC3-II formation, is critical for viral replication. Altogether, these findings suggest that although HCV needs the elongation complex for its replication, it has developed a mechanism to avoid canonical LC3-II accumulation at viral replication site."

Data for this case-control study were retrieved from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database. In total, 3399 cases of newly diagnosed SSNHL were identified. We used propensity score matching to select 3399 comparison patients (one for every case) from the same dataset. The selected matching variables included age, sex, monthly income, geographical location, urbanization level of the patient's residence, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Chi-squared tests were used to compare differences in sociodemographic characteristics, while conditional logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association of SSNHL with previously diagnosed MVP. Of the 6798 sampled subjects, 131 (1.93%) patients had received a diagnosis of MVP prior to the index date. A significant difference in the prevalence of prior MVP between cases and controls (2.41% vs. 1.44%, p = 0.004) was observed. The conditional logistic regression analysis conditioned on gender, age, monthly income, urbanization level, geographic region, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension suggested that the odds ratio of prior MVP for cases was 1.69 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18~2.42) compared to controls. Our study found that patients with MVP had a 1.69-fold higher risk of getting SSNHL compared to patients without MVP."

We investigated treatment results and factors associated with triglyceride reduction after fenofibrate therapy using large-scale real-world data. Patients with one or more cardiovascular risk factors, at low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol goal but with triglyceride level ≥150 mg/dL, and undergoing treatment with fenofibrate 135-160 mg for the first time were included in this retrospective observational study. The outcome variable was the percentage changes of TG levels. The achievement rate of triglyceride <150 mg/dL was additionally analyzed. Factors associated with treatment results were also analyzed. Among 2546 patients who were initially screened, 1113 patients were enrolled (median age: 61 years; male: 71%). After median follow-up of 4 months, the median change in triglyceride was -60%, and 49% of the patients reached triglyceride <150 mg/dL. After adjusting for confounding variables, female sex, non-diabetic status, coronary artery disease, lower baseline triglyceride, and no statin use were identified to be independently associated with achievement of triglyceride <150 mg/dL. Among them, female sex, non-diabetic status, and coronary artery disease were also related to median or greater percentage reduction of triglyceride. In conclusion, only half of the study patients reached triglyceride levels <150 mg/dL after real-world fenofibrate therapy. This study indicates that more attention is needed on some subgroups to obtain optimal triglyceride levels when treating with fenofibrate."

Due to difficulties and limitations to obtain large samples from SFP and FTC, cotton swabs were used to collect the biofilm from the wall of these installations. Molecular characterization was performed using massively parallel sequencing to obtain a taxonomic and functional gene classification. Also, samples from the drainage system were evaluated because microorganisms may travel over the 12-meter column of the pool water of the Brazilian Nuclear Power Plant (Angra1), which has been functioning since 1985. Regardless of the treatment of the pool water, our data reveal the unexpected presence of Fungi (Basidiomycota and Ascomycota) as the main contaminators of the SFP and FTC. Ustilaginomycetes (Basidiomycota) was the major class contributor (70%) in the SFP and FTC reflecting the little diversity in these sites; nevertheless, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes (Bacilli) were present in small proportions. Mapping total reads against six fungal reference genomes indicate that there is, in fact, a high abundance of fungal sequences in samples collected from SFP and FTC. Analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and 2 regions and the protein found in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells, cytochrome b (cytb) grouped our sample fungi in the clade 7 as Ustilago and Pseudozyma. In contrast, in the drainage system, Alphaproteobacteria were present in high abundances (55%). The presence of Sphingopyxis, Mesorhizobium, Erythrobacter, Sphingomonas, Novosphingobium, Sphingobium, Chelativorans, Oceanicaulis, Acidovorax, and Cyanobacteria was observed. Based on genomic annotation data, the assessment of the biological function found a higher proportion of protein-coding sequences related to respiration and protein metabolism in SFP and FTC samples.

https://openalex.org/W2895490252,"This study evaluates whether intrathecal MVIIA injection after spinal cord injury (SCI) elicits neuroprotective effects. The test rats were randomly distributed into six groups- sham, placebo, MVIIA 2.5 μM, MVIIA 5 μM, MVIIA 10 μM, and MVIIA 20 μM-and were administered the treatment four hours after SCI. After the optimal MVIIA dose (MVIIA 10 μM) was defined, the best time for application, one or four hours, was analyzed. Locomotor hind limb function and side effects were assessed. Forty-eight hours after the injury and immediately after euthanasia, spinal cord segments were removed from the test rats. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and glutamate release were investigated. To examine the MVIIA mechanism of action, the gene expressions of pro-apoptotic (Bax, nNOS, and caspase-3, -8, -9, -12) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xl) factors in the spinal cord tissue samples were determined by real-time PCR, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were also investigated. Application of intrathecal MVIIA 10 μM four hours after SCI prompted a neuroprotective effect: neuronal death decreased (22.46%), oxidative stress diminished, pro-apoptotic factors (Bax, nNOS, and caspase-3, -8) were expressed to a lesser extent, and mitochondrial viability as well as anti-apoptotic factor (Bcl-xl) expression increased. These results suggested that MVIIA provided neuroprotection through antioxidant effects. Indeed, superoxide dismutase (188.41%), and glutathione peroxidase (199.96%), reductase (193.86%), and transferase (175.93%) expressions increased. Therefore, intrathecal MVIIA (MVIIA 10 μM, 4 h) application has neuroprotective potential, and the possible mechanisms are related to antioxidant agent modulation and to intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2894732556,"The interaction of intermediate filaments (IFs) with the cell-cell adhesion complexes desmosomes is crucial for cytoskeletal organization and cell resilience in the epidermis and heart. The intracellular desmosomal protein desmoplakin anchors IFs to the cell adhesion complexes predominantly via its four last carboxy-terminal domains (C-terminus). However, it remains unclear why the C-terminus of desmoplakin interacts with different IF types or if there are different binding affinities for each type of IFs that may influence the stability of cell-specific adhesion complexes. By yeast three-hybrid and fluorescence binding assays, we found that the coiled-coil 1 of the conserved central rod domain of the heterodimeric cytokeratins (Ks) 5 and 14 (K5/K14) was required for their interaction with the C-terminus of desmoplakin, while their unique amino head- and C-tail domains were dispensable. Similar findings were obtained in vitro with K1/K10, and the type III IF proteins desmin and vimentin. Binding assays testing the C-terminus of desmoplakin with assembled K5/K14 and desmin IFs yielded an apparent affinity in the nM range. Our findings reveal that the same conserved domain of IF proteins binds to the C-terminus of desmoplakin, which may help explain the previously reported broad binding IF-specificity to desmoplakin. Our data suggest that desmoplakin high-affinity binding to diverse IF proteins ensures robust linkages of IF cytoskeleton and desmosomes that maintain the structural integrity of cellular adhesion complexes. In summary, our results give new insights into the molecular basis of the IF-desmosome association."
https://openalex.org/W2895248156,"Decision making based on behavioral and neural observations of living systems has been extensively studied in brain science, psychology, neuroeconomics, and other disciplines. Decision-making mechanisms have also been experimentally implemented in physical processes, such as single photons and chaotic lasers. The findings of these experiments suggest that there is a certain common basis in describing decision making, regardless of its physical realizations. In this study, we propose a local reservoir model to account for choice-based learning (CBL). CBL describes decision consistency as a phenomenon where making a certain decision increases the possibility of making that same decision again later. This phenomenon has been intensively investigated in neuroscience, psychology, and other related fields. Our proposed model is inspired by the viewpoint that a decision is affected by its local environment, which is referred to as a local reservoir. If the size of the local reservoir is large enough, consecutive decision making will not be affected by previous decisions, thus showing lower degrees of decision consistency in CBL. In contrast, if the size of the local reservoir decreases, a biased distribution occurs within it, which leads to higher degrees of decision consistency in CBL. In this study, an analytical approach for characterizing local reservoirs is presented, as well as several numerical demonstrations. Furthermore, a physical architecture for CBL based on single photons is discussed, and the effects of local reservoirs are numerically demonstrated. Decision consistency in human decision-making tasks and in recruiting empirical data is evaluated based on the local reservoir. This foundation based on a local reservoir offers further insights into the understanding and design of decision making."
https://openalex.org/W2894840075,"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are precursors of eggs and sperm. Although PGCs are unipotent cells in vivo, they are reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), also known as embryonic germ cells (EGCs), in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in vitro. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for their reprogramming are not fully understood. Here we show identification of transcription factors that mediate PGC reprogramming. We selected genes encoding transcription factors or epigenetic regulatory factors whose expression was significantly different between PGCs and PSCs with in silico analysis and RT-qPCR. Among the candidate genes, over-expression (OE) of Bcl3 or Klf9 significantly enhanced PGC reprogramming. Notably, EGC formation was stimulated by Klf9-OE even without bFGF. G-protein-coupled receptor signaling-related pathways, which are involved in PGC reprogramming, were enriched among genes down-regulated by Klf9-OE, and forskolin which activate adenylate cyclase, rescued repressed EGC formation by knock-down of Klf9, suggesting a molecular linkage between KLF9 and such signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2895610116,"Defective clearance of apoptotic cells in MFG-E8 deficient mice results in lupus-like disease in the mixed B6x129, but not pure B6 background. The lack of overt autoimmunity in MFG-E8-/- B6 mice suggests that accumulation of apoptotic cells is not sufficient to break central tolerance. However, the delayed clearance of apoptotic cells in the follicles of MFG-E8-/- B6 mice provides an excellent opportunity to investigate how B cells respond to excessive apoptotic cells in the periphery under relatively non-inflammatory conditions. In MFG-E8-/- B6 mice, we found increased IgG2c production against apoptotic cells and oxidized LDL. Apoptotic cell induced antibody responses depended on MyD88 signal and T cell help. In addition, MFG-E8-/- B6 mice had enlarged MZ B cell compartments as well as an enhanced antibody response to NP-Ficoll. Moreover, a significant percentage of MZ B cells in aged MFG-E8-/- B6 mice migrated into follicles. Injecting apoptotic cells or oxidized LDL into wild type mice as well as physiological accumulation of LDL in ApoE-/- mice recapitulated the translocation of MZ B cells. To determine how MFG-E8 deficiency affects the functions of autoreactive B cells specific for nucleic acids in the periphery under non-inflammatory conditions, we utilized BCR transgenic mice to bypass central selection and compared the differentiation of TLR9 dependent anti-dsDNA 56R B cells and TLR7 dependent anti-ssRNA H564 B cells in MFG-E8-/- mice. In MFG-E8-/- 56R mice, anti-dsDNA specific 56R/Vκ38c B cells differentiated into MZ B cells but not AFCs. On the contrary, in MFG-E8-/-H564 mice, anti-ssRNA specific H564 B cells further differentiated into GC B cells and AFCs. Adoptive transfer of activated autoreactive B cells confirmed that H564 B cells were more sensitive to apoptotic cell antigens than 56R B cells. Our observations provide new insights about the MZ B cell translocation in lupus patients as well as the dichotomy of TLR9 and TLR7 signals in the pathogenesis of lupus."
https://openalex.org/W2895428149,"I should have been celebrating. I had just hit the “submit” button on the online portal for doctoral theses, concluding my Ph.D. studies. And I did feel a sense of satisfaction. I had worked hard and was proud of what I had accomplished. But I was also overwhelmed by depression and anxiety about my future. Almost all my recently graduated friends had several published papers from their Ph.D. work; I had none. I thought my chances at the academic career I so wanted were ruined. I felt lost and alone in an endless desert.

> “I shouldn't have defined myself based on my publication record.” 

I could point to reasons why I hadn't published. I had changed fields between my master's degree and Ph.D., and it had taken time to get up to speed in my new discipline. I needed to figure out how to work with my new lab's complex custom-built instruments and tune them for my experiments. There were no senior graduate students or postdocs in the lab to train me at the time, which made this task even more challenging. I eventually got my experiments to work, and I learned a tremendous amount along the way, scientifically and personally. But that is not the same as generating publishable results.

As I approached the end of my Ph.D., I was anxious to publish. Yet my Ph.D. scholarship only covered 3 years, with limited support for a fourth year. My time was up. I had enough data to write and defend my thesis, but the results were not ready for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

So there I was: a newly minted Ph.D. hoping to pursue an academic career but without any papers from my primary project. My applications for postdoctoral research positions were either rejected or ignored. I needed to try something different.

A few years earlier, a grad student friend and I had worked on a side project, which we published with the help of one of his advisers. The work was in some ways very different from my scientific training and my primary Ph.D. project (I was a chemical engineer, and my friend's lab was in the chemistry department), but I had enjoyed applying my knowledge and perspective in this new realm. Now, I thought this experience might help me get a position in that lab.

I arranged a meeting with the lab's principal investigator (PI) and another senior PI. They were working on a joint project, and we had a lively discussion about it and where they were having trouble. I found that my different scientific background and the fundamental knowledge I had developed during my doctoral studies enabled me to propose plausible solutions and alternative approaches that hadn't occurred to them. They offered me a temporary research associate position, with the possibility of staying on longer if things went well. It wasn't the prestigious postdoc position I had initially been looking for, but I was happy to have found some water in my post-Ph.D. desert.

I thrived in this new position. I finished the project in a few months—the PIs had originally expected that it would take a year—and they invited me to continue as an official postdoctoral fellow. I published some of my new work relatively quickly and initiated and completed a number of new projects. I also eventually published the results of my Ph.D. project. Most important, I enjoyed my work. I've since moved on to another position, and despite my earlier publication drought, I am optimistic about my future career prospects.

Looking back, I wish I could tell my recently graduated self that I shouldn't have defined myself based on my publication record. My list of publications doesn't matter as much as the knowledge I gained in the process and the sense of purpose that kept me going. And I wish I could tell everyone else to try to look past publications, at least a little, when evaluating other scientists. Yes, publications are important. But a lack of publications doesn't mean a lack of intelligence, skills, or worth.

IMAGE: NASA JET PROPULSION LABORATORY

Launched in 1997, the Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004 and spent the following 12 years orbiting far outside the planet's rings. Among the mission's many discoveries were potentially habitable environments on Saturn's moons, including a subsurface ocean of water on Enceladus.

To avoid accidental contamination of the moons with any Earth bacteria that might have hitched a ride on the spacecraft, mission planners decided that when Cassini ran out of fuel it would be deliberately crashed into Saturn. As fuel reserves ran low, the spacecraft embarked on a series of maneuvers that took it through previously unexplored regions and ended with its destruction.

The first phase was a series of 20 “ring-grazing” orbits in which Cassini passed near the outer edge of the rings. Then the trajectory was shifted to fly through the gap between the planet and the inner edge of the rings, a phase dubbed the “Grand Finale.” Cassini flew through this region 22 times, in various orientations designed to optimize the scientific measurements made by its numerous instruments. Finally, in 2017 Cassini dove into the planet itself at 35 km s−1, leading to the spacecraft's fiery disintegration in the upper atmosphere.

The papers in this section present results from those final phases of the mission. They include studies of Saturn's puzzling magnetic field, an isolated inner radiation belt, auroral radio emission, the mass and composition of solid grains falling from the rings toward the planet, and the composition of Saturn's atmosphere. Many more results will follow from Cassini's last period of exploration in the Saturn system.
