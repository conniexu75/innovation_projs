https://openalex.org/W2026856852,"Eukaryotic chromosomes are capped with repetitive telomere sequences that protect the ends from damage and rearrangements. Telomere repeats are synthesized by telomerase, a ribonucleic acid (RNA)-protein complex. Here, the cloning of the RNA component of human telomerase, termed hTR, is described. The template region of hTR encompasses 11 nucleotides (5'-CUAACCCUAAC) complementary to the human telomere sequence (TTAGGG)n. Germline tissues and tumor cell lines expressed more hTR than normal somatic cells and tissues, which have no detectable telomerase activity. Human cell lines that expressed hTR mutated in the template region generated the predicted mutant telomerase activity. HeLa cells transfected with an antisense hTR lost telomeric DNA and began to die after 23 to 26 doublings. Thus, human telomerase is a critical enzyme for the long-term proliferation of immortal tumor cells."

To define how Rev acts, we used conjugates between bovine serum albumin (BSA) and peptides comprising the Rev activation domain (BSA-R). BSA-R inhibited Rev-mediated nuclear RNA export, whereas a mutant activation domain peptide conjugate did not. BSA-R did not affect the export of mRNA, tRNA, or ribosomal subunits, but did inhibit export of 5S rRNA and spliceosomal U snRNAs. BSA-R was itself exported from the nucleus in an active, saturable manner. Thus, the Rev activation domain constitutes a nuclear export signal that redirects RRE-containing viral RNAs to a non-mRNA export pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2019099644,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), the gene product that is mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, has a well-recognized function as a cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-regulated chloride channel, but this property does not account for the abnormally high basal rate and cAMP sensitivity of sodium ion absorption in CF airway epithelia. Expression of complementary DNAs for rat epithelial Na+ channel (rENaC) alone in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells generated large amiloride-sensitive sodium currents that were stimulated by cAMP, whereas coexpression of human CFTR with rENaC generated smaller basal sodium currents that were inhibited by cAMP. Parallel studies that measured regulation of sodium permeability in fibroblasts showed similar results. In CF airway epithelia, the absence of this second function of CFTR as a cAMP-dependent regulator likely accounts for abnormal sodium transport."
https://openalex.org/W2080169144,"The X-ray structure of the ternary complex of a calcineurin A fragment, calcineurin B, FKBP12, and the immunosuppressant drug FK506 (also known as tacrolimus) has been determined at 2.5 A resolution, providing a description of how FK506 functions at the atomic level. In the structure, the FKBP12-FK506 binary complex does not contact the phosphatase active site on calcineurin A that is more than 10 A removed. Instead, FKBP12-FK506 is so positioned that it can inhibit the dephosphorylation of its macromolecular substrates by physically hindering their approach to the active site. The ternary complex described here represents the three-dimensional structure of a Ser/Thr protein phosphatase and provides a structural basis for understanding calcineurin inhibition by FKBP12-FK506."

https://openalex.org/W2086011121,"Endothelial adhesion molecules facilitate the entry of leukocytes into inflamed tissues. This in turn promotes neovascularization, a process central to the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, tumor growth and wound repair. Here we test the hypothesis that soluble endothelial adhesion molecules promote angiogenesis. Human recombinant soluble E-selectin and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 induced chemotaxis of human endothelial cells in vitro and were angiogenic in rat cornea. Soluble E-selectin acted on endothelial cells in part through a sialyl Lewis-X-dependent mechanism, while soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 acted on endothelial cells in part through a very late antigen (VLA)-4 dependent mechanism. The chemotactic activity of rheumatoid synovial fluid for endothelial cells, and also its angiogenic activity, were blocked by antibodies to either soluble E-selectin or soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. These results suggest a novel function for soluble endothelial adhesion molecules as mediators of angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1993011693,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an endothelial specific angiogenic mitogen secreted from various cell types including tumor cells. Increasing evidence suggests that VEGF is a major regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis, and the VEGF/VEGF receptor system has been shown to be necessary for glioma angiogenesis.

C6 glioma cells provide an in vivo glioma model for the study of tumor angiogenesis, and the expression of VEGF in C6 cells has been shown to be up-regulated by hypoxia in vitro. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of hypoxic induction of VEGF. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxic induction of VEGF in C6 cells is due to both transcriptional activation and increased stability of mRNA. Nuclear run-on assays revealed a fast and lasting transcriptional activation, whereas the determination of mRNA half-life showed a slower increase of mRNA stability during hypoxia. Reporter gene studies revealed that hypoxia responsive transcription-activating elements were present in the 5′-flanking region of the VEGF gene. These results suggested that several distinct molecular mechanisms were involved in hypoxia-induced gene expression and were activated in a biphasic manner.

INTRODUCTIONNormal embryonic development, wound healing, and certain physiological processes such as corpus luteum formation require the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, a process termed angiogenesis(1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Angiogenesis also plays an important role in some pathological events, for example, in solid tumor growth, diabetic retinopathy, or rheumatoid arthritis(2Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar). The growth of solid tumors is angiogenesis-dependent(2Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar). Several polypeptide growth factors such as fibroblast growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 1The abbreviations used are: VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorEPOerythropoietinPipes1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidkbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s). transforming growth factor-β are thought to be involved, directly or indirectly, in the regulation of angiogenesis(2Folkman J.

Among these factors, VEGF has been reported to be an endothelial cell-specific mitogen(4Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.-J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4413) Google Scholar, 5Keck P.J. Hauser S.D. Krivi G. Sanzo K. Warren T. Feder J. Connolly D.T.

In situ hybridization studies showed that the expression of genes encoding VEGF and its receptors correlated both spatially and temporally with brain angiogenesis during embryonic development(7Breier G. Albrecht U. Sterrer S. Risau W. Development. 1992; 114: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnürch H. Martinez R. Mller N.P.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). 2Breier, G., Clauss, M., and Risau, W., Dev. Dynamics, in press. Also in glioma, in which angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of malignancy, the higher grade malignant astrocytoma showed a higher expression of VEGF mRNA in tumor cells as well as VEGF receptor mRNA in endothelial cells(9Plate K.H. Breier G. Weich H.A. Risau W. Nature. 1992; 359: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). In vivo studies revealed that growth of solid tumors could be inhibited by injection of a specific antibody capable of blocking VEGF-induced angiogenesis (10Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3325) Google Scholar) or by overexpressing a dominant-negative VEGF receptor mutant(11Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Nature. 1994; 367: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that VEGF was a key regulator of both embryonic and tumor angiogenesis. In glioblastoma multiforme, the highest expression of the VEGF gene was observed in palisading cells surrounding necrotic areas(9Plate K.H. Breier G. Weich H.A. Risau W. Nature. 1992; 359: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 12Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4126) Google Scholar), which indicated that hypoxia might up-regulate VEGF gene expression in vivo. It has been shown that VEGF gene expression is up-regulated by hypoxia in vitro and in vivo(12Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4126) Google Scholar, 13Plate K.H. Breier G. Millauer B. Ullrich A. Risau W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5822-5827PubMed Google Scholar, 14Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Minchenko A. Bauer T. Salceda S. Caro J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 374-379PubMed Google Scholar). Taking these observations together, it is conceivable that focal hypoxia is working as an essential trigger for pathological angiogenesis through up-regulation of VEGF gene expression. To define the physiological and pathological roles of hypoxia in angiogenesis in vivo, it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms by which hypoxia up-regulates VEGF gene expression in vitro.In addition to VEGF, hypoxia is known to up-regulate the expression of several genes including the erythropoietin (EPO)(16Krantz S.B. Blood. 1991; 77: 419-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), tyrosine hydroxylase(17Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Furnari B.A. Lawson E.E. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 760-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor-B chain(18Kourembanas S. Hannan R.L. Faller D.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), phosphoglycerate kinase 1, and lactate dehydrogenase A genes(19Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Among these molecules, EPO has been most extensively studied. A sequence in the 3′-flanking region of the EPO gene has been identified as a hypoxia-responsive enhancer in liver, and a hypoxia-inducible factor 1 has been found to bind this enhancer sequence(20Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar).Although several similarities between the gene expression of VEGF and EPO have been reported, including CoCl2-induced expression (14Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the molecular mechanisms of the regulation of VEGF gene expression by hypoxia. It has been shown that hypoxia-induced synthesis of VEGF is regulated at the RNA level in cultured cells, including C6 glioma cells(12Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4126) Google Scholar, 13Plate K.H. Breier G. Millauer B. Ullrich A. Risau W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5822-5827PubMed Google Scholar, 14Goldberg M.A. Schneider T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cardiac myocytes (21Ladoux A. Frelin C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and vascular smooth muscle cells(22Stavri G.T. Hong Y. Zachary I.C. Breier G. Baskerville P.A. Ylä-Herttuala S. Risau W. Martin J.F. Erusalimsky J.D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In this study, we used C6 glioma cells, which provide an in vivo glioma model(13Plate K.H. Breier G. Millauer B. Ullrich A. Risau W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5822-5827PubMed Google Scholar), to analyze the molecular mechanisms which mediate VEGF mRNA induction by hypoxia. We present evidence that the hypoxia-induced increase of VEGF gene expression is due to both transcriptional activation and increased mRNA stability. Furthermore, the timing of the transcriptional activation is different to that of the increase in mRNA stability during the course of the hypoxic response, suggesting that several distinct molecular mechanisms are involved in the cellular response to hypoxia. In addition, we demonstrate that the 5′-flanking region of the VEGF gene confers the transcriptional activation in C6 cells in response to hypoxia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals[α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and human placental ribonuclease inhibitor were purchased from Amersham. Ribonucleotide triphosphates were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, tRNA from bakers' yeast, tRNA from Escherichia coli (RNase-free), DNase I (RNase-free), proteinase K, α-amanitin, poly(A), RNase A, actinomycin D, and chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside were from Boehringer Mannheim. Formamide was from Fluka.Cell Line and Culture ConditionsRat C6 glioma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. C6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4500 mg/liter glucose, Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), and incubated at a CO2 level of 5% either with 20% O2 (atmospheric air) for normoxia or with 1% O2 balanced with N2 for hypoxia. Hypoxia was generated in an oxygen-regulated incubator (Forma Scientific/Labotect, Model 3015), which took approximately 15 min to equilibrate to 1% O2. C6 cells were seeded onto culture plates 2 days before hypoxic incubation, and the medium was replaced 1 day before the incubation. The cells were subconfluent at the beginning of hypoxic incubation.RNA Extraction and Northern AnalysisTotal cellular RNA was isolated by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction(23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62983) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of total RNA (20 μg/lane) were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels containing 2.2 M formaldehyde. RNA was blotted by capillary transfer to a nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham) in 20 × SSC. Filters were cross-linked with UV light (0.5 J/cm2), and prehybridized for 2-4 h at 42°C in 50% formamide, 5 × SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM NaCitrate, pH 7), 5 × Denhardt's solution (0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42°C with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled murine VEGF164 cDNA (7Breier G. Albrecht U. Sterrer S. Risau W. Development. 1992; 114: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Filters were washed in 2 × SSC for 30 min at 42°C, in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS for 30 min at 42°C, in 0.3 × SSC, 0.5% SSC twice for 30 min at 42°C, and then exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with intensifying screens at −80°C. Subsequently, filters were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled chick β-actin cDNA (24Kost T.A. Theodorakis N. Hughes S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 8287-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) for standardization. Quantitative analysis was also performed with a PhosphorImager SF (Molecular Dynamics).Nuclear Run-on AssayC6 cells were treated as follows: (i) normoxia; (ii) hypoxia for 3 h; (iii) hypoxia for 15 h. Nuclei were isolated from cultured C6 cells essentially as described by Dignam et al.(25Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9143) Google Scholar). In brief, cells from three 100-mm culture plates were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 6 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g, for 5 min, at 4°C. Subsequent steps were performed at 4°C. The cells were resuspended gently in 1 ml of ice-cold swelling buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol), and allowed to stand on ice for 5 min. The swollen cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and resuspended in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.3 M sucrose, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol). After lysis by 10 strokes with a glass Dounce homogenizer, the homogenate was checked under the microscope for cell lysis, and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. Nuclei were washed once with homogenization buffer, resuspended in glycerol storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 40% glycerol), and frozen in liquid N2.In vitro transcription and isolation of the resulting RNA were performed as described by Birch and Schreiber (26Birch H.E. Schreiber G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8077-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications as described below. The nuclei (5 × 106 in 50 μl of glycerol storage buffer) were thawed and mixed with 50 μl of 2 × reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 300 mM KCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 400 units/ml placental ribonuclease inhibitor, 20 mM creatine phosphate, 200 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase) and 1 mM each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, and 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). The reaction was incubated at 25°C for 30 min with shaking, 20 units of DNase I (RNase-free) were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 25°C for further 5 min. Proteinase K and SDS were added to a final concentration of 150 μg/ml and 0.5%, respectively, and incubation continued at 37°C for 30 min. The reaction was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v), and RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase with ethanol in the presence of 2.5 M ammonium acetate. The precipitate was resuspended in 200 μl of 5 mM MgCl2, treated with 100 units of DNase I (RNase-free) at 37°C for 60 min, and then EDTA and SDS were added to a final concentration of 15 mM and 0.5%, respectively. Following extraction with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and ethanol precipitation, the precipitate was suspended in 100 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA. Parallel samples were processed in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml α-amanitin.For hybridization of the radiolabeled RNA to specific DNA targets, linearized plasmid DNAs (15 μg, per slot) were immobilized onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen Plus; DuPont NEN) using a Bio-Dot SF microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad). The immobilized plasmid DNAs were as follows: murine VEGF164 cDNA(7Breier G. Albrecht U. Sterrer S. Risau W. Development. 1992; 114: 521-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chick β-actin cDNA(24Kost T.A. Theodorakis N. Hughes S.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 8287-8301Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), both cloned in pBluescript KS (Stratagene), and pBluescript KS DNA to assay for nonspecific hybridization. The filters were prehybridized overnight at 42°C in 1.5 ml of buffer containing 20 mM Pipes, pH 6.4, 50% formamide, 2 mM EDTA, 0.8 M NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 1 × Denhardt's solution (0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone), 200 μg/ml E. coli tRNA (RNase-free), 100 μg/ml poly(A). Hybridization was at 42°C for 48 h in the same solution supplemented with 4.5 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled RNA. The filters were washed twice in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 42°C for 30 min, twice in 0.3 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 42°C for 30 min, and then incubated with 10 μg/ml RNase A in 2 × SSC at 37°C for 30 min. Filters were washed in 2 × SSC at 37°C for 30 min, and finally in 0.3 × SSC at 37°C for 30 min. The amount of 32P-labeled RNA hybridized to each plasmid DNA on the filters was measured using a PhosphorImager. The amount of VEGF mRNA was standardized by comparison with the amount of β-actin mRNA. After measurement, the filters were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film with intensifying screens at −80°C.mRNA Stability AssayThe half-life of VEGF mRNA was determined by treating C6 cells with actinomycin D as described by Lindholm et al.(27Lindholm D. Heumann R. Hengerer B. Thoenen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16348-16351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). C6 cells were cultured under either normoxia, hypoxia for 3 h, or hypoxia for 15 h, and then actinomycin D was added into the growth medium (10 μg/ml) to block transcription. Immediately after addition of actinomycin D, the cells were returned to the same culture conditions (normoxia or hypoxia). During the following 7 h, cells were harvested every hour, and total RNA was prepared and Northern analysis was performed as described. The amounts of VEGF mRNA and β-actin mRNA at each time point was quantified after Northern analysis with a PhosphorImager. The amount of VEGF mRNA was corrected for loading differences by the amount of β-actin mRNA. This correction was confirmed by staining the gel with ethidium bromide (data not shown).Plasmid Constructs and Transient TransfectionA genomic DNA clone from the human VEGF gene(28Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), containing approximately 2.5 kb of 5′-flanking region with the putative promoter and 1 kb of 5′-untranslated region, was provided by Dr. Judith A. Abraham. A 3.2-kb KpnI-NarI fragment, spanning a region from 80 bp up to 3.3 kb upstream of the translation start site of the VEGF gene, was subcloned upstream of the luciferase gene in the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL2-Basic Vector (Promega). From this construct, a series of deletion derivatives, including deletion of a 0.9-kb NheI-NarI fragment containing the 5′-untranslated region, were generated as shown in Fig. 4. Hypoxia responsiveness of these constructs in C6 cells was tested by transient transfection assays. A plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by the mouse hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase promoter (29Gautier C. Mehtali M. Lathe R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a promoter which showed minimal hypoxia responsiveness (data not shown), was used as a control plasmid to standardize transfection efficiency.Plasmids were transfected into C6 cells by Lipofectin Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) essentially following the protocol from the manufacturer. C6 cells were seeded (3 × 105 cells/60 mm-diameter culture plate) 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected with 5 μg of test plasmid and 5 μg of control plasmid. For a given test plasmid, 2 plates were transfected at the same time. The cells were incubated with DNA/Lipofectin mixture for 6 h, and then the mixture was replaced by normal growth medium. Following 24 h under normoxia, one of the two plates was incubated for 18 h under normoxia, the other for 18 h under hypoxia, respectively. Cell extracts were prepared using Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and measured for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. Luciferase activity was measured by AutoLumat LB 953 (Berthold) with Luciferase Assay System (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was measured by using chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside as substrate(30Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 739-743PubMed Google Scholar). For standardization of transfection efficiency, luciferase activity was divided by β-galactosidase activity (luciferase/β-galactosidase). The degree of induction by hypoxia for each test plasmid was then determined as the ratio of standardized luciferase activity in cells under hypoxia to that in cells under normoxia.RESULTSInduction of VEGF mRNA Synthesis in C6 Cells by HypoxiaA time course of hypoxia-induced changes in VEGF mRNA levels in C6 cells was established by Northern analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, levels of VEGF mRNA began to increase after 3 h incubation of 1% O2, reached steady-state level after around 15 h, and remained elevated until the end of the period examined (24 h). In several independent experiments, we observed approximately 3-4-fold induction of VEGF mRNA after 3 h of hypoxia and 8-10-fold induction after 15 h of hypoxia. The major transcript size was approximately 4 kb. However, additional other species of VEGF mRNA were detected after longer exposure time. In contrast to VEGF mRNA, neither significant increase nor decrease of β-actin mRNA by hypoxia was observed up to 15 h of hypoxia in several independent experiments. In some experiments, long lasting hypoxia (longer than 15 h) led to a decrease in β-actin mRNA, which correlated with a decrease in cell viability (Fig. 1).Figure 1:Hypoxic induction of VEGF mRNA in C6 cells. C6 cells were incubated either under normoxia or under hypoxia (1% O2) for the number of hours indicated. Total RNA (20 μg/lane) was analyzed by Northern analysis using probes for VEGF (top panel) and β-actin (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Induction of VEGF Gene Expression by Hypoxia Is, in Part, Due to Transcriptional ActivationIn order to investigate whether hypoxia activates transcription of the VEGF gene in C6 cells, nuclear run-on assays were performed. Nuclei were prepared from C6 cells cultured under normoxia and under hypoxia for 3 and 15 h. To quantify the transcriptional rate, 32P-labeled RNAs transcribed from these nuclei were hybridized to plasmids containing murine VEGF cDNA, β-actin cDNA for standardization, or pBluescript vector DNA as a negative control, which were immobilized on the filters. We observed activation of transcription of the VEGF gene after 3 and 15 h of hypoxia, whereas the transcription of the β-actin gene was almost unchanged (Fig. 2). In vitro transcription of the VEGF gene was not detected when α-amanitin, a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, was included in the reaction mixture (data not shown). The signal intensity of each slot was measured with a PhosphorImager, and the degree of induction of transcription of the VEGF gene by hypoxia was determined after standardization to β-actin gene transcription. Two independent run-on assays showed that the transcriptional rate of the VEGF gene was elevated 3.4 ± 0.5-fold after 3 h of hypoxic incubation and 2.5 ± 0.6-fold after 15 h of hypoxic incubation.Figure 2:Nuclear run-on analysis of transcription of the VEGF and β-actin genes in C6 cells during incubation under hypoxia. Nuclei were prepared from C6 cells under normoxia or after hypoxic incubation for 3 or 15 h. After in vitro transcription in the presence of [α-32 P]UTP, 32 P-labeled RNA (4.5 × 106 cpm) was hybridized to VEGF cDNA, β-actin cDNA, and pBluescript plasmid immobilized on a nylon membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)VEGF mRNA Stability Is Differentially Regulated from Transcriptional ActivationTo evaluate the effect of hypoxia on VEGF mRNA stability, we measured half-lives of VEGF mRNA in C6 cells cultured under normoxia and under hypoxia for 3 and 15 h. Cells were treated with actinomycin D in order to block transcription, and the amount of VEGF mRNA in cells thereafter was measured by Northern analysis with a PhosphorImager, and corrected for loading differences by the amount of β-actin mRNA (Fig. 3). Half-life values for VEGF mRNA obtained from two independent experiments were as follows: under normoxia, 0.89 ± 0.05 h; after 3 h hypoxic treatment, 1.1 ± 0.2 h; after 15 h hypoxic treatment, 2.3 ± 0.2 h. Interestingly, we could not detect significant differences between the half-lives of VEGF mRNA in C6 cells cultured under normoxia and under hypoxia for 3 h. However, the half-life of VEGF mRNA was about 2.6-fold greater in C6 cells after 15 h of hypoxic treatment. These data and the nuclear run-on studies indicate that the initial induction of VEGF mRNA levels in C6 cells after 3 h of hypoxic treatment (3-4-fold, see Fig. 1) is primarily due to transcriptional activation, whereas the late induction after 15 h of hypoxic treatment (approximately 8-10-fold) is due to both transcriptional activation and mRNA stabilization.Figure 3:VEGF mRNA stability under normoxia or hypoxia. A-C, autoradiographs of Northern analyses. C6 cells cultured under normoxia (A) or after hypoxic incubation for 3 (B) or 15 (C) h were treated with actinomycin D (ActD), and then total RNA samples were collected every hour and analyzed by Northern analysis for VEGF mRNA and β-actin mRNA. Autoradiography for VEGF mRNA was at −80°C for 14 days for the normoxia filter (A) and 7 days for the filters for both hypoxia 3 (B) and 15 (C) h. D, quantitative analysis of VEGF mRNA stability from two independent experiments. Quantitative analysis was performed with a PhosphorImager. Comparison of VEGF mRNA levels in the cells at each time point was achieved by normalization to β-actin mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Sequences from the 5′-Flanking Region of the VEGF Gene Confer Hypoxic ResponsivenessBased on the results obtained from nuclear run-on assays, we expected cis-acting elements to control the transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene in C6 cells in response to hypoxia. Therefore, we tested several reporter constructs containing 5′-flanking and 5′-untranslated sequences from the human VEGF gene (28Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4) for hypoxic responsiveness in a transient transfection assay. C6 cells were transfected with these reporter constructs, and the induction of luciferase activity by hypoxia was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A 131-bp fragment from an ApaI site (−1169; numbered from the translation start site) to the transcription start site(−1038) contained the minimal DNA sequence required for the basal transcription of the human VEGF gene. A 1.2-kb SacI-NheI fragment (−2218 to −984) was shown to be hypoxia responsive, but further deletion of the region between the SacI and BanI sites (−2218 to −1926) deprived the fragment of its hypoxic responsiveness. Thus these studies revealed that a hypoxia responsive element is located in the 293-bp SacI-BanI fragment (−2218 to −1926), and that the 0.9-kb NheI-NarI (−984 to −81) fragment of 5′-untranslated region contains no elements involved in hypoxic induction. These results confirm our result from nuclear run-on assays which showed that hypoxia induces transcriptional activation of the VEGF gene.DISCUSSIONAngiogenesis is one of the most important aspects in various kinds of physiological and pathological processes(1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar). For example, a solid tumor could not grow beyond a certain size without angiogenesis (2Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4022) Google Scholar). Clarification of the molecular mechanisms regulating angiogenesis is of great benefit, because it might lead to the establishment of new tumor therapy based on the suppression of neovascularization. Recently, we and others have demonstrated the important role of VEGF in tumor angiogenesis(9Plate K.H. Breier G. Weich H.A. Risau W.

The mouse telomerase RNA component was cloned and contained only 65 percent sequence identity with the human telomerase RNA. Alteration of the template region in vivo generated altered telomerase products. The shorter template regions of the mouse and other rodent telomerase RNAs could account for the shorter distribution of products (processivity) generated by the mouse enzyme relative to the human telomerase. Amounts of telomerase RNA increased in immortal cells derived from primary mouse fibroblasts. RNA was detected in all newborn mouse tissues tested but was decreased during postnatal development.

The solution structure of a fragment of CD2 containing the covalently bound high-mannose N-glycan [-(N-acetylglucosamine)2-(mannose)5-8] was solved by nuclear magnetic resonance. The stem and two of three branches of the carbohydrate structure are well defined and the mobility of proximal glycan residues is restricted. Mutagenesis of all residues in the vicinity of the glycan suggests that the glycan is not a component of the CD2-CD58 interface; rather, the carbohydrate stabilizes the protein fold by counterbalancing an unfavorable clustering of five positive charges centered about lysine-61 of CD2."
https://openalex.org/W2006345660,"The growth potentiating effects of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-II are modulated by a family of six insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs). Despite the similarity in amino acid sequences of the IGFBPs, their effects on the growth of bone cells differ. Studies on the molecular mechanisms for IGFBP-4 actions revealed that coincubation of bone cells with IGFBP-4 and 125I-IGF-I or 125I-IGF-II decreased the binding of both of these ligands in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, IGFBP-4 decreased the binding of IGF-I tracer to purified type I IGF receptor. These data in conjunction with data showing that IGFBP-4 had no effect on cell proliferation induced by analogs of IGF-I or IGF-II, which exhibited >100-fold reduced affinity for binding to IGFBP-4 suggest that IGFBP-4 may inhibit IGF action by preventing the binding of ligand to its membrane receptor.

INTRODUCTIONStudies in our and other laboratories provide strong support to the concept that insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) 1The abbreviations used are: IGFinsulin-like growth factorIGFBPinsulin-like growth factor binding proteinrhrecombinant humanBSAbovine serum albuminDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyhBDIGFBPhuman bone-derived IGFBP. function in an autocrine/paracrine manner to regulate the proliferative and differentiative functions of bone cells(1Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Clin. Ortho. 1991; 263: 30-48PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baylink D.J. Finkelman R.D. Mohan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: S565-S572Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 3Canalis E. Pash J. Varghese S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 155-166PubMed Google Scholar). The findings that support this concept are as follows. First, IGF-I and IGF-II have been found in bone extracts of several different species, and IGFs are the most abundant growth factors stored in bone(4Bautista C. Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Metabolism. 1990; 39: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Canalis E. McCarthy T. Centrella M. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1988; 43: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Second, IGFs have been shown to be one of the most abundant mitogens produced by bone cells derived from both fetal and adult bone, and the bone cell production of IGFs is regulated by both local and systemic effectors of bone metabolism(1Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Clin. Ortho. 1991; 263: 30-48PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baylink D.J. Finkelman R.D. Mohan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: S565-S572Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 3Canalis E. Pash J. Varghese S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 155-166PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the exogenous addition of IGFs have been shown to stimulate both proliferative and differentiative functions in bone cells(1Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Clin. Ortho. 1991; 263: 30-48PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baylink D.J. Finkelman R.D. Mohan S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: S565-S572Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 3Canalis E. Pash J. Varghese S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1993; 3: 155-166PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, there is recent evidence that demonstrates that IGFs increase bone formation parameters in vivo in both rats and humans (6Mueller K. Cortesi R. Modrowski D. Marie P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E1-E6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Johansson A.G. Lindh E. Ljunghall S. Lancet. 1992; 339: 1619Abstract PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Ebeling P.R. Jones J.D. O'Fallon W.M. Janes C.H. Riggs B.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1993; 77: 1384-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).The local activity of IGFs in bone and other tissues is dependent not only on the amount of IGFs produced but also by a family of structurally related proteins that specifically bind to IGFs. Six IGF binding proteins (designated IGFBP-1 through IGFBP-6), different from the IGF receptors, have been purified from human plasma or tissues including bone(9Spencer E.M. Modern Concepts of Insulin-like Growth Factors. New York, Elsevier1991Google Scholar, 10Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 49-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 11Shimasaki S. Ling N. Prog.

Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have shown that human bone cells in culture secrete a number of IGFBPs of which the 25-kDa IGFBP-4 is one of the major IGFBPs produced by bone cells. Studies on the biological actions of IGFBP-4 revealed that IGFBP-4 inhibits both IGF-I- and IGF-II-induced cell proliferation in embryonic chick calvaria cells and MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts under all culture conditions tested(15Mohan S. Bautista C. Wergedal J.E. Baylink D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8338-8342Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In addition, IGFBP-4 has been shown to inhibit the growth of embryonic chick pelvic cartilage in vitro(16Schiltz P.M. Mohan S. Baylink D.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of IGFBP-4 on IGF-induced cell proliferation does not appear to be specific to bone cells since Cheung et al.(17Cheung P.T. Smith E.P. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Chernausek S.D. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 1006-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have shown that IGFBP-4 inhibits IGF-induced cell proliferation in neuroblastoma cell line, and Culouscou and Shyoab et al.(18Culouscou J.M. Shyoab M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2813-2819PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the colon cancer cell growth inhibitor purified from conditioned medium of the HT29 human adenocarcinoma cell line is identical to IGFBP-4.In contrast to IGFBP-4, studies on the biological actions of IGFBP-5, the major IGFBP stored in human bone, revealed that IGFBP-5 is a stimulator of IGF-induced mouse bone cell proliferation(19Bautista C.M. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Similar potentiating effects of IGFBP-5 purified from U2 human osteosarcoma cell conditioned medium have been reported by Andress and Birnbaum(20Andress D.L. Birnbaum R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 21Andress D.L. Brinbaum R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22467-22472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Jones et al.(22Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that when IGFBP-5 was present in cell culture substrata, it potentiated the growth stimulatory effects of IGF-I on fibroblasts. Although Kiefer et al.(23Kiefer M.C. Schmid C. Waldvogel M. Schlapfer I. Futo E. Masiarz F.R. Green K. Barr P.J. Zapf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12692-12699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that recombinant human IGFBP-5 produced in yeast inhibited DNA synthesis in SaOS-2/B10 human osteosarcoma cells, subsequent studies from the same laboratory have shown that recombinant human IGFBP-5 stimulated DNA synthesis in rat osteoblasts(24Schmid Ch. Schlapfer I. Froesch E.R. Kiefer M. Zapf J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: S293Google Scholar). Together, the findings that IGFBPs modulate IGF actions either positively or negatively and that the production of IGFBPs is regulated by various physiological agents(9Spencer E.M. Modern Concepts of Insulin-like Growth Factors. New York, Elsevier1991Google Scholar, 10Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 49-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 11Shimasaki S. Ling N. Prog.

Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) support the conclusion that the balance between the stimulatory and inhibitory classes of IGFBPs will determine the degree and extent of IGF-induced cellular responses in target tissues such as bone.Although IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5, which share 35% sequence identity with each other, exhibit opposite effects on bone cell proliferation, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms by which these binding proteins exert their effects on bone cell proliferation. There is limited data available in other cell types for IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3, which have been shown to both stimulate and inhibit IGF actions (25Blat C. Delbe J. Villaudy J. Chatelain G. Golde A. Harel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12449-12454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26DeMellow J.S.M. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Raizada M.K. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Insulin-like Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 381-394Crossref Google Scholar). Blat et al.(25Blat C. Delbe J. Villaudy J. Chatelain G. Golde A. Harel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12449-12454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that exogenous addition of IGFBP-3 caused a 100% inhibition of DNA synthesis induced by IGF-I in chick embryo fibroblasts. In contrast, preincubation of fibroblasts with IGFBP-3 prior to the addition of IGF-I resulted in the potentiation of IGF-I action(26DeMellow J.S.M. Baxter R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). While cell surface attachment of IGFBP-3, which also binds to heparin, has been suggested to be an important mechanism for the potentiation of IGF-I action by IGFBP-3, a number of other mechanisms have also been suggested(27Conover C.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3191-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 28Clemmons D.R. LeRoith D. Raizada M.K. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Insulin-like Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 381-394Crossref Google Scholar). The current studies were undertaken to extend the mechanistic data available for the IGFBPs by characterizing the biological effects of IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 on MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts and on normal human bone cells under identical culture conditions and by evaluating whether IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 modulate their actions on bone cell proliferation by different mechanisms. These data indicate that the molecular mechanisms by which IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 affect bone cells are different and that IGFBP-5 may bind bone cells by an IGF-independent mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe clonal osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1, was obtained originally from newborn mouse calvarial cells (29Sudo H.

Burdon R.H. Knippenberg P.H. Modern Methods in Protein and Nucleic Acid Analysis. Elsevier, New York1990Google Scholar). IGFBP-4 was purified from human bone cell conditioned medium as described previously, and the homogeneity of the preparation was established by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis (15Mohan S.

No detectable levels of IGF-I or IGF-II were found in the purified preparations of IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5. Recombinant human IGF-I and IGF-II were purchased from Austral Biologicals (Torrance, CA). Recombinant human des-1-3-IGF-I and des-1-6-IGF-II were kindly provided by G. L. Francis (Co-operative Research Center for Tissue Growth and Repair, Adelaide, Australia). Purified human IGF-I receptor was a gift from Y. Fujita-Yamaguchi (City of Hope, Duarte, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Calf serum was purchased from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was purchased from Fluka. [3H] Methylthymidine and 125I were purchased from International and Chemical Nuclear (Irvine, CA) and DuPont NEN. All other chemicals used were at least reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma.IodinationIodination of proteins was performed using chloraimine T method as described previously(35Mohan S. Bautista C. Herring S. Linkhart T.A. Baylink D.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2534-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The specific activity of radiolabeled IGFs varied between 200 and 400 μCi/μg of protein, while that of IGFBPs varied between 100 and 200 μCi/μg of protein. Aliquots of radiolabeled IGFs were stored at −70°C and used for IGF radioligand assays.Purification of hBDIGFBP-5Purification was as described previously (19Bautista C.M. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) with modifications to reduce proteolysis: procedures were executed rapidly and, where possible, at 4°C; all buffers included 1 mM EDTA (Sigma), 1 mM leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim), and 1 mM pepstatin (Boehringer Mannheim). After hydroxyapatite and IGF-II affinity chromatography steps, the concentrated sample was applied to a reverse phase HPLC column, 250 mm × 7 mm C8 Aquapore column (Applied Biosystems, Foster City CA), and after washing, the bound material was eluted with a gradient of 25% acetonitrile to 35% acetonitrile run over 100 min at a flow rate of 3 ml/min. 2-min fractions were collected and concentrated in a speed-vac apparatus (Savant Instruments Inc., Farmingdale NY), and aliquots of the redissolved material were used for ligand blots and protein sequencing. Ligand blots employed precast 10-20% gradient gels (Jule Inc., New Haven CT), and molecular size was estimated using prestained low molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad). Protein sequencing of both nonreduced and reduced and pyridyl ethylated samples employed an Applied Biosystems model 470A vapor phase sequencer (Biotechnology Instrumentation Facility, University of California, Riverside CA) as described previously(15Mohan S.

Osteoblast-like human osteosarcoma cell lines (SaOS-2, MG63) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, and the cells were passaged upon reaching confluence by dispersing the cells with trypsin. Untransformed normal human bone cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and were maintained as described previously(35Mohan S. Bautista C. Herring S. Linkhart T.A. Baylink D.J. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2534-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Cell Proliferation StudiesCell proliferation was determined by using the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. For [3H]thymidine incorporation studies, cells were plated (2,000/well) in 0.05 ml of DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum in 96-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h. 0.05 ml of DMEM containing 0.1% BSA (DMEM/BSA) or 0.05 ml of DMEM/BSA containing the effector was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 18 h. The cells were then pulse labeled for 4 h with 0.25 μCi of [3H]methylthymidine. The radioactive medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then extracted with 0.05 ml of 0.2 N sodium hydroxide, and the extract was transferred to scintillation vial and then counted after mixing with 2 ml of scintillation fluid. Eight replicates were used for each treatment.Effect of IGFBP on IGF-I or IGF-II Binding to Cells in Monolayer CultureCells were plated in DMEM containing 0.1% calf serum in 96-well culture plates as described for [3H]thymidine incorporation studies. After overnight incubation, the medium was removed, the cultures were rinsed with DMEM/BSA, and 0.03 ml of DMEM/BSA was added. 0.01 ml of DMEM/BSA containing various concentrations of IGFBP was then added, and the cultures were incubated with 125I-labeled IGF-I or IGF-II (40,000 cpm) for 3 h at room temperature. The labeled medium was discarded, and the cultures were rinsed 5 times with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. 125I-Labeled IGF-I or IGF-II bound to cells was extracted with lysis buffer and counted as described previously(34Mohan S.

At the end of incubation, the labeled medium was discarded, and the cultures were rinsed 5 times with DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. 125I-IGFBP bound to cells was extracted with lysis buffer and counted as described previously(34Mohan S.

Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 2534-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).IGF-I Binding to IGF-I Receptors in the Presence of IGFBPCompetition of IGF binding to IGF-I receptor by IGFBPs was carried out using human placental type I IGF receptor that was purified as described previously(36Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Choi S. Sakamoto Y. Itakura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5045-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, duplicate aliquots of approximately 50 fmol of receptor were incubated in 0.1 ml of 50 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, 40,000 cpm of 125I-IGF-I and various concentrations of IGFBP-4 or IGFBP-5. The reactions were carried out in the absence or presence of unlabeled IGF-I to determine the specificity of the binding. After 24 h of incubation, affinity cross-linking of the receptor bound ligand was performed by adding 1 μl of 10 mM disuccinimidyl suberate prepared freshly in dimethyl sulfoxide. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 1 M Tris, 0.2 M sodium EDTA. 25 μl of 5 × electrophoresis sample buffer was then added; the samples were boiled for 3 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 3-17% gradient gel. At the end of electrophoresis, the gel was fixed and subjected to autoradiography. Cross-linking of 125I-IGF-I to receptor or IGFBP was quantitated by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograph with Bio-Med Instruments (Fullerton, CA).IGFBP Assay0.05 ml of sample containing 2 ng of IGFBP-4 or IGFBP-5 was incubated with 50,000 cpm of 125I-labeled IGF-I or IGF-II for 60 min at room temperature in 0.1 M Hepes (pH 6.0) containing 0.1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.044 M sodium carbonate, 0.01% sodium azide (0.25 ml volume). Bound and free 125I-IGF were separated by adding 0.1 ml of 2% bovine serum immunoglobulin and 0.5 ml of polyethylene glycol 8000 and centrifuging(15Mohan S. Bautista C. Wergedal J.E. Baylink D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8338-8342Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Specific binding was determined by subtracting bound counts in the presence of excess cold IGF from bound counts determined at various concentrations of IGFs or their analogs.Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis was performed using Student's t test.RESULTSAmino-terminal Amino Acid Sequence of hBDIGFBPThe previously determined amino-terminal amino acid sequence for the hBDIGFBP was similar to but not identical to the contemporaneously determined IGFBP sequences from human osteosarcoma (37Shimasaki S. Shimonaka M. Zhang H.-P. Ling N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10646-10653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human placental (38Kiefer M.C. Ioh R.S. Bauer D.M. Zapf J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 176: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) cDNA library, now named IGFBP-5. To determine whether the hBDIGFBP was identical to or a variant of IGFBP-5, human bone extract, prepared so as to minimize proteolysis, was subjected to IGFBP purification by two successive affinity chromatography steps, first on hydroxyapatite and then on IGF-II, followed by a reverse phase HPLC separation. Purification of hBDIGFBP under these conditions yielded one predominant protein peak with an apparent molecular mass of 29,000 Da that exhibited IGF binding activity on western ligand blot (data not shown). Amino acid sequencing of the amino-terminal residues of nonreduced and of reduced and pyridyl ethylated preparations of the hBDIGFBP and comparison of these sequences with previously described IGFBP sequences, the nomenclature of which has been recently revised(39Ballard F.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1736-1737PubMed Google Scholar), showed that the amino-terminal sequence of the hBDIGFBP is identical to IGFBP-5 (Fig. 1). The purification of hBDIGFBP also yielded a 19-kDa form of IGFBP, which had identical amino-terminal residues to IGFBP-5 (Fig. 1).Effects of IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 on Basal and IGF-induced Bone Cell ProliferationProliferation of the mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was decreased when it was exposed to IGFBP-4 (Fig. 2). Basal cell proliferation in the absence of exogenous growth factors was inhibited by 50% when MC3T3-E1 cells were exposed to 100 ng/ml IGFBP-4. The stimulation of proliferation associated with exposure to 3 ng/ml IGF-I was also decreased by IGFBP-4. However, IGFBP-4 had negligible effect on the proliferation associated with exposure to 3 ng/ml des-1-3-IGF-I (Fig. 2A), which exhibited >100-fold reduced affinity for IGFBP-4 compared with wild-type IGF-I (Fig. 3A). IGFBP-4 causes a dose-dependent decrease in the stimulation of proliferation associated with exposure to IGF-II but has much less effect on the stimulation of proliferation associated with exposure to des-1-6-IGF-II (Fig. 2B). This analog of IGF-II, like des-1-3-IGF-I, also exhibited >100-fold reduced affinity for IGFBP-4 compared with wild-type IGF-II (Fig. 3B).Figure 2:Effect of IGFBP-4 and IGFBP-5 on MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation as measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine.

The role of tyrosine phosphorylation in the modulation of synaptic function in the central nervous system, however, is not clear. In this study, immunocytochemical staining with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody demonstrates that there are high levels of phosphotyrosine, which co-localizes with glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses on cultured hippocampal neurons. In addition, the tyrosine phosphorylation of various subtypes of glutamate receptors were examined using subunit-specific antibodies. Glutamate receptors are the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the central nervous system and are classified into three major classes: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionate, kainate, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, based on their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties. NMDA receptors play a central role in synaptic plasticity, synaptogenesis, and excitotoxicity and are thought to be heteromeric complexes of the two types of subunits: NR1 and NR2(A-D) subunits. Immunoaffinity chromatography of detergent extracts of rat synaptic plasma membranes on anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-agarose showed that the NR2A and NR2B subunits but not the NR1 subunit are tyrosine-phosphorylated. Conversely, immunoprecipitation of the NR1, NR2A, and NR2B subunits with subunit specific antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies confirmed that the NR2A and NR2B subunits but not the NR1 subunit were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. No tyrosine phosphorylation of the AMPA (GluR1-4) and kainate (GluR6/7, KA2) receptor subunits was detected. It was estimated that 2.1 ± 1.3% of the NR2A subunits and 3.6 ± 2.4% of the NR2B subunits were tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo. In addition, endogenous protein-tyrosine kinases in synaptic plasma membranes phosphorylated the NR2A subunit in vitro, increasing its phosphorylation 6-8-fold but did not phosphorylate NR1 or NR2B. These studies demonstrate that NMDA receptor subunits are differentially tyrosine-phosphorylated and suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2 subunits may be important for regulating NMDA receptor function.

After purification of the fusion protein using glutathione-coated beads, thrombin cleavage allowed recovery of the MscL protein. The purified protein was reconstituted into artificial liposomes and found to be fully functional when examined with the patch-clamp technique. The reconstituted recombinant MscL protein formed ion channels that exhibited characteristic conductance and pressure sensitivity and were blocked by the mechanosensitive ion channel inhibitor gadolinium.

The recombinant protein was found to be fully functional when reconstituted into artificial liposomes and was used to raise polyclonal anti-MscL antibodies. This work was presented in preliminary form(16Hse C.C. Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: A393Google Scholar). E. coli strain DH5α was from Life Technologies, Inc.; plasmids pGEM11Zf(+) and pGEX-2T were from Promega and Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology (Uppsala, Sweden), respectively. Bacto-tryptone and yeast extract were from Oxoid Ltd. (Hampshire, United Kingdom). The following reagents were purchased from Sigma: octyl glucoside, Tris, EDTA, lysozyme (L 6876), o-dianisidine, thrombin (T 7009), HEPES, SDS, MOPS, bovine serum albumin (A2153), phosphatidylcholine (P 3644), and cholesterol.

E. coli strain DH5α was used as the host for recombinant plasmids and E. coli strain AW737-KO, carrying a chromosomal insertion in the mscL gene(12Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), was used for the protein expression experiments. Plasmid p5-2-2 carrying the entire open reading frame (ORF) of mscL on a XhoI DNA fragment, generated by the polymerase chain reaction method, was described previously(12Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Plasmids pGEM11Zf(+) and pGEX-2T were used for generating pGEX1.1. Bacterial cells were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani broth (10 g/liter Bacto-tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) with 50 μg/ml ampicillin for cells carrying plasmids and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol for the mscL knock-out E. coli mutant, added when required. Plasmid DNA was extracted from E. coli cells using the alkaline lysis method (17Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9838) Google Scholar). Standard techniques (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used for the generation of recombinant plasmid constructs described under “Results.” Restriction enzymes and DNA ligase were purchased from Promega and used as specified by the manufacturer. DNA restriction fragments were electrophoresed in horizontal 0.8% agarose gels in 40 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml). DNA fragments were excised from 1% low melting agarose gels (Promega), melted at 55°C, and used directly in ligation reactions. Recombinant fusion protein was purified essentially as described previously(14Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 15Guan K.-L.

Bacterial cells harboring the plasmid pGEX1.1 were subgrown for 1 h at 37°C (1 ml of an overnight culture in 20 ml of broth), and fusion protein gene expression was induced for 3 h with 0.1 mM IPTG. The cells were harvested, resuspended in 5 ml of 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and lysed by addition of lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) and detergent (1.5% octyl glucoside). After bath sonication for approximately 60 s (Unisonics Pty. Ltd., Sydney, Australia), cell debris was pelleted (16,000 rpm, 20 min; J2-MI, Beckman), and 0.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were added to the supernatant for 1 h at room temperature (20-22°C). The beads were then washed at least three times (by centrifugation using a desk top centrifuge at 4,000 rpm for 5 min) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.2, adjusted with NaOH) and resuspended in PBS containing an additional 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 50 mM Tris. Thrombin was added to a final concentration of ≈1 unit/μg of protein and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Octyl glucoside in PBS was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) for 10 min, the beads were pelleted (4,000 rpm, 5 min), and the supernatant was found to contain the MscL protein. For reconstitution into artificial liposomes and antibody generation, purified MscL protein was dialyzed for 16 h against 4 liters of 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5, with Calbiosorb beads to remove any octyl glucoside, and the protein was concentrated in Amicon filtration units (Amicon, Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and protein samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described(18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified recombinant MscL protein was analyzed at the University of Western Australia Centre for Molecular Biology, using the Edman degradation procedure.

Small aliquots of lipid were dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 5 mM Tris, pH 7.2, and bath-sonicated for 15 min. The liposomes were collected by ultracentrifugation (TL-100, Beckman Instruments) at 105,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 10 mM MOPS, 5% ethylene glycol, pH 7.2. Purified protein was added at the desired protein:lipid ratio. Aliquots of the liposomes were spotted onto glass slides and allowed to dehydrate for several hours followed by overnight rehydration (200 mM KCl, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2) under humid conditions. Two female New Zealand albino rabbits were prebled and injected with approximately 100 μg of purified MscL protein in TiterMax adjuvant (Vaxcel, Inc., Norcross, GA). Antibody titers were checked after 3 and 6 weeks by Western blot analyses essentially as described(18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual.

Briefly, protein samples were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose in transfer buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM glycine, 20% methanol). The filters were reacted with rabbit antibodies (diluted 1:1100 for whole sera, 1:50 for affinity-purified antibodies), incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Sigma) (diluted 1:1,000), and developed with substrate solution (0.2 mMo-dianisidine, 0.01% H2O2 in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4). MscL-specific antibodies were purified by coupling purified MscL protein to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose beads with subsequent washes and elution conditions as described previously(19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies were dialyzed against 100-fold diluted PBS and then concentrated 100-fold by lyophilization (Dynavac, Pty. Ltd., Sydney, Australia). For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the wells of microtiter plates were coated with various concentrations of purified MscL protein in PBS overnight at 4°C. The coated plates were then washed in PBS with 0.02% Tween, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, washed again, and reacted with antisera (diluted 1:1,000 for whole sera, 1:100 for affinity-purified antibodies) at 4°C overnight. The plates were washed again and incubated with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody (diluted 1:5000) for 2 h at room temperature. Substrate was added, and absorbance at 410 nm was measured on a microplate reader (Series 700, Cambridge Technology, Inc., Watertown, MA). The improved patch-clamp techniques of Hamill et al.(20Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflgers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar) were used to record single-channel currents from isolated membrane patches. Pipettes were made from borosilicate glass (Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA) using a Flaming/Brown Micropipette puller (P-87, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA) and pulled to a diameter which gave bubble numbers of 3.2-3.5 in 100% ethanol, corresponding to pipette resistances in the range 6.4-5.3 MΩ, respectively, when in recording solution. Pipettes were coated with clear nail enamel (Super Shine Top Coat, Sally Hansen, North Ryde, Australia) and filled with recording solution (200 mM KCl, 40 mM MgCl2, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH). A small aliquot (1-2 μl) of rehydrated liposomes was placed in the 0.5-ml patch-clamp chamber containing recording solution, and the chamber was situated on an inverted phase contrast microscope (IMT-2, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan). The reference electrode was a Ag/AgCl pellet separated from the bath by an agar bridge (2% agarose in 1 M KCl). Pipettes were positioned with a Leitz micromanipulator (Ernst Leitz Wetzlar GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and were touched against unilamellar blisters arising spontaneously from the liposomes as reported(9Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 10Delcour A.H. Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1989; 56: 631-636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Seals (>20 GΩ) either formed immediately or following application of a brief (1-2 s) pulse of negative pressure (<50 mmHg), applied to the interior of the patch pipette. Channel activation was normally achieved by applying pressure steps of −20 to −30 mmHg by mouth over a period of several seconds every 5-10 s. For rapid pressure steps (≈1 s), suction was applied by mouth in a single step from 0 mmHg to a pressure exceeding the activation threshold for that particular patch. Single-channel currents were filtered at 1 kHz, recorded using a patch-clamp amplifier (List Electronics, Darmstadt, Germany), and digitized at 5 kHz by a computer running WinTida analogue to digital acquisition software (Heka Electronics, Heidelberg, Germany). Data files were analyzed off-line using commercial software or programs written in this laboratory. The XhoI DNA restriction fragment containing the entire ORF of mscL from plasmid p5-2-2 (12Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) was first subcloned into plasmid vector pGEM11Zf(+) in the desired orientation as determined by restriction enzyme analysis. The gene was then excised and cloned into the expression vector pGEX-2T as a BamHI-EcoRI DNA fragment (now named pGEX1.1), thus generating a continuous ORF with the GST gene (Fig. 1). This genetic construct should lead to the production of a 41-kDa hybrid protein consisting of a N-terminal GST portion (26 kDa) and a C-terminal MscL portion (15 kDa) separated by a thrombin cleavage site. Upon thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein, nine amino acids as well as the initial methionine residue, which are not present in purified wild-type MscL(12Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Blattner F.R. Kung C. Nature. 1994; 368: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), are expected to be present on the N terminus of the recombinant MscL protein (Fig. 1). N-terminal protein sequence analysis of the purified MscL protein confirmed the presence of these ten amino acid residues. Upon IPTG induction of E. coli cells carrying the plasmid pGEX1.1, encoding the GST-MscL fusion protein, a major protein band of approximately 40 kDa appeared in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The induced fusion protein was purified in a single step by addition of glutathione-Sepharose beads to E. coli cell lysates. Analysis of the material absorbed by the glutathione-Sepharose beads revealed a single major protein band of approximately 40 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 3). After incubation of the Sepharose-bound fusion protein with thrombin, two additional protein bands of 26 and 17 kDa were generated, presumably representing GST and MscL, respectively (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Following thrombin digestion, the MscL channel protein was further purified by removal of the GST portion of the fusion protein with the beads fraction (Fig. 2A, lane 5). The molecular weight of these protein bands corresponds well with those predicted from the DNA sequence. Polyclonal anti-MscL antisera were generated by injecting purified MscL protein into rabbits. Both animals showed significant anti-MscL titers several weeks after injection, as determined by Western blot and ELISA analyses of the collected sera. MscL-specific antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography and were used in the Western blot shown in Fig. 2B. Both fusion protein and MscL showed strong reactivity with the antibodies (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 5), whereas no significant reactivity was observed with any other E. coli proteins or GST (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 4). However, in E. coli cells strongly expressing the fusion protein, several smaller molecular weight protein bands reacted with the antibodies (Fig. 2B, lane 2), which presumably represent proteolytic degradation products of the fusion protein. Immune reactions of pre-sera, sera following MscL injection, and affinity-purified anti-MscL antibodies, against purified MscL protein were also examined in ELISA analysis. Pre-sera showed no significant reactivity with MscL protein, whereas immune blood exhibited strong reactivity; about half of the antibody titer was recovered after purification over a MscL-affinity column (data not shown). Purified MscL protein was reconstituted into liposomes (protein:lipid ratio of 1:6000) and observed to be functional when examined with the patch-clamp technique (Fig. 3). Single-channel currents were recorded from excised patches of liposome membrane at pipette potentials ranging from −40 mV to +40 mV and pressures ranging from −50 to −200 mmHg. No channel activity was observed in excised patches from liposomes not containing MscL protein (n = 5 patches). In addition, no activity was observed in patches from liposomes containing either GST-MscL fusion protein (n = 8 patches; protein:lipid ratio of 1:3000) or GST protein alone (n = 4 patches; protein:lipid ratio of 1:5900). Activation of the MscL by pressure ceased following removal of the stimulus as shown in Fig. 3. As pressure is increased in small steps, the threshold of activation is crossed, and the channel activated. Furthermore, if the applied negative pressure is maintained at a constant level, the channel activity in many patches slowly increased with time (Fig. 3). In patches where the number of active channels was low, MscL activity occurred as a burst of single openings followed by a long inactivation period. Following this inactivation, channel activity was not recovered either by repeated application of voltage (−40 mV to +40 mV) or by application of negative pressure up to 200 mmHg. Channels were activated when negative pressure (suction) exceeded a threshold, typically in the range of 50 to 100 mmHg. As the amount of applied pressure increased, channel activity and hence channel open probability also increased (Fig. 4A). We have used a Boltzmann distribution curve to describe the apparent pressure sensitivity of the reconstituted MscL protein. The open probability of the channels in a particular patch was plotted against the applied suction, and the data were fitted to a Boltzmann distribution (Fig. 4B). For reconstituted MscL, an e-fold change in open probability was observed following a change of 4.9 ± 1.4 mmHg (mean ± S.E., n = 3 patches) at a pipette potential of +10 mV, and 3.9 ± 1.1 mmHg at a pipette potential of −10 mV (n = 2 patches). The average applied negative pressure required to induce half-maximal activation of MscL was 72 ± 3 mmHg (n = 3 patches) at a pipette potential of +10 mV, and 71 ± 6 mmHg (n = 2 patches) at a pipette potential of −10 mV. In response to a more rapid (1-2 s) change in pressure, the MscL exhibited rapid activation, followed by adaptation (Fig. 5). At present, we are unable to examine this phenomenon in more detail because of the relatively slow step change in pressure attainable with our experimental apparatus. This activation following a rapid change in pressure has also been observed for the MscS in in situ recordings from giant E. coli spheroplasts(21Buechner M.J. Mechanosensitive Ion Channels and Outer Membrane Permeability of Escherichia Coli. 1990; (Dissertation thesis, University of Wisconsin-Madison)Google Scholar). The conductance of the purified MscL was estimated from the amplitude of the single-channel currents and the applied pipette voltage (Fig. 6). The MscL showed slight rectification at positive pipette voltages. The conductance at negative potentials using a linear regression fit to the data was 3,500 pS and, for positive potentials, was 3,300 pS, with the reversal potential close to zero as expected for this nonselective ion channel(9Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the present study, reconstituted MscL was inhibited by gadolinium in a reversible manner (Fig. 7). Complete blockade of channel activity by 1.0 mM gadolinium was observed even at negative pressures up to 150 mmHg. At a lower concentration (0.2 mM), inhibition by gadolinium was still observed; however, this inhibition could be reversed by increasing the applied pressure (data not shown(9Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar)). Liposomes containing either purified MscL or MscL which had been preincubated in a 1:1 molecular ratio of affinity-purified anti-MscL antibodies for 1 h, were examined. In 11 of the 16 patches examined containing MscL alone, single-channel currents were observed under standard conditions of voltage and pressure. However, in 16 patches examined where MscL was preincubated with anti-MscL antibody, no single-channel opening events were observed at pressures up to −200 mmHg. In this study, we have used a common method of expressing recombinant proteins in E. coli as fusion proteins with GST (14Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 15Guan K.-L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar) to produce substantial amounts of purified MscL protein. A plasmid expression vector was constructed encoding a hybrid protein with fusion of MscL to the C terminus of GST separated by a thrombin cleavage site. Induction of the hybrid gene resulted in strong expression of the fusion protein followed by a rapid single-step purification from E. coli cell lysates using glutathione-coated beads. The recombinant MscL protein was further purified by mild detergent extraction following thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein bound to the beads. Proteolytic digestion of the fusion protein by thrombin resulted in the presence of several amino acid residues at the N terminus of the recombinant protein that are not found in the wild-type MscL protein, as confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. The experiments with the recombinant MscL did not indicate any major effects of these additional amino acid residues on channel properties. However, unlike the native MscL protein examined following gel filtration and reconstitution, which does not exhibit rectification (9Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), at positive pipette voltages a slight rectification was observed with the recombinant channel. At present, we are unable to explain this observation, but one possibility may be that the additional ten amino acids present on the recombinant MscL interfere with the unidirectional passage of ions through the channel pore. With these amino acids present, it is unlikely that the N-terminal portion of MscL plays a major role in the transduction of mechanical force used for activation of this channel, since the activation pressures for the recombinant MscL were similar to those observed for the native protein reconstituted in liposomes(9Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used the purified recombinant protein to generate specific polyclonal anti-MscL antibodies which showed strong reactivity with both fusion protein and MscL in Western blot and ELISA analyses. When incubated with MscL protein prior to reconstitution, these antibodies abolished channel activity. These anti-MscL antibodies should enable us to study MscL location in the native E. coli cell envelope, as well as to identify cross-reactive proteins in other organisms. Purified MscL protein was reconstituted into liposomes and found to be fully functional, exhibiting characteristic conductance and pressure sensitivity, similar to that of the native channel(9Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition, following incorporation into liposomes, the recombinant channel was blocked by the common inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels, gadolinium(4Martinac B. Jackson M.B. CRC Thermodynamics of Membrane Receptors and Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 327-352Google Scholar), at concentrations similar to those reported to inhibit the MscL of E. coli following reconstitution of solubilized native membranes(7Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabo I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 9Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Gadolinium appeared to increase the activation threshold of the MscL, suggesting a partial reversal of the inhibition by pressure. However, since in the majority of cases the number of channels observed per patch was relatively high (on average 3 to 6), this result may also reflect that due to the increased open probability, there is an increased likelihood of observing those channels in the patch not inhibited by gadolinium. The number of channels present in a particular patch of membrane appeared to influence the type of activity displayed by the recombinant protein. Where the number of active channels in the patch was relatively low(1Sachs F. CRC Crit. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 1989; 16: 141-169Google Scholar, 2Morris C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), openings occurred as a single burst followed by long inactivation. In the majority of patches where the number of active channels was higher, the MscL exhibited sustained activity, and, furthermore, in many patches channel activity was observed to slowly increase with time. A similar increase in activity of the MscL from native E. coli membranes has been observed, and, typically, channel activity continues to increase with time until the patch ruptures. ( 2C. C. Hse, A. C. Le Dain, and B. Martinac, unpublished observation. )Taken together, the results suggest that upon application of negative pressure there may be cooperativity between MscL molecules, either with regard to activation or association of the channel monomers with one another. It is tempting to speculate that the possible mechanism of MscL activation by lipid bilayer tension consists of assembly of pore-forming multimers from dispersed channel monomers in response to mechanical force. A multimeric form (possibly a tetramer) of the functional channel (9Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) is suggested from the observation that the native channel purified from the E. coli cell envelope has an approximate molecular mass of 60-80 kDa compared to that of the monomer of 15 kDa. A possible indication of an association mechanism for MscL activation comes from the results of the polyclonal antibody experiments. When mixed with the channel protein prior to incorporation into liposomes, anti-MscL antibodies prevented any channel activity from being observed. However, another more trivial explanation for the effect of the antibodies may simply be that the MscL protein-antibody complex may not insert into the lipid bilayer in a way which allows channel activation by pressure. Further evidence for interaction between functional MscL derives from the observation that the recombinant MscL was more responsive to rapid steps in pressure than in response to a gradual increase in stimulus. A similar phenomenon has been reported for mechanosensitive channels of hair cells of the turtle and stretch-activated channels of Xenopus oocytes(22Hamill O.P. McBride D.W. News Physiol. Sci. 1994; 9: 53-59Google Scholar). A possible physiological role for this rapid activation may be in providing part of a defense mechanism against rapid changes in osmotic pressure(7Berrier C. Coulombe A. Szabo I. Zoratti M. Ghazi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Activation by pressure of mechanosensitive channels in E. coli can be described by a Boltzmann distribution(8Martinac B. Buechner M. Delcour A.H. Adler J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2297-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). However, for the recombinant MscL, in many patches continuous application of pressure resulted in an increase in channel activity with time, and, furthermore, where channel number was low, channel inactivation was observed. Therefore, in these experiments, the Boltzmann distribution could only be used as an approximate description of the channel quasi-steady-state activity, since the channels were not truly in an equilibrium state. However, the results for this apparent pressure sensitivity of MscL did show that the reconstitution method decreases the pressure required to activate these channels without altering the activation profile with respect to pressure. A similar lowering in activation pressure threshold has been reported for both MscS and MscL when purified native channels were incorporated into liposomes(9Sukharev S.I. Martinac B. Arshavsky V.Y. Kung C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have used a common method for expressing recombinant proteins in E. coli to produce significant amounts of purified MscL protein, and the recombinant channel isolated was found to be fully functional when reconstituted into artificial liposomes. Furthermore, the rapid protein purification method described in this paper will enable us to examine mutagenized MscL proteins and hence explore the role of specific regions of the protein molecule involved in the mechanotransduction process.

The receptors mediating these interactions have not previously been identified. In this study, monoclonal antibodies raised to the integrin alpha 3 beta 1 heterodimer are shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth by rat sympathetic neurons on thrombospondin-1. Alpha 3 beta 1 is found to be expressed on the cell body, neurites, and growth cones of sympathetic neurons in vitro and on sympathetic axons passing through the thrombospondin-rich outer sheath of the superior cervical ganglion in vivo, consistent with its role in mediating axon outgrowth. A receptor-ligand binding assay is used to demonstrate the direct binding of immunopurified alpha 3 beta 1 to thrombospondin-1. These results demonstrate a direct interaction between the integrin alpha 3 beta 1 and thrombospondin-1, which mediates neurite outgrowth in vitro and is likely to mediate the same interactions in vivo."

TNF has been long recognized for its ability to induce PCD of tumor cells in culture and has been investigated as a therapeutic agent in this capacity(11Baglioni C. Beutler B.

Although the molecular mechanism of Fas- and TNF-induced apoptosis, as well as that of all other forms of apoptosis, remains to be elucidated, there is strong evidence that an intracellular protease is part of the cell death machinery. Initial support for this hypothesis came from the genetic analysis of programmed cell death in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where a gene designated ced-3 was found to be obligatory for PCD(15Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of ced-3 revealed significant homology to the mammalian protein interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE), an Asp-specific cysteine protease(16Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2203) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ICE revealed that catalytically important residues were conserved in the Ced-3 protein(17Walker N.P.C. Talanian R.V. Brady K.D. Dang L.C. Bump N.J. Ferenz C.R. Franklin S.

Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), suggesting that Ced-3 itself was a cysteine protease. These findings also raised the possibility that in mammalian cells a cysteine protease homologous to Ced-3, perhaps ICE, is a component of the death machinery. We tested this hypothesis by expressing, in cells sensitive to Fas- or TNF-induced apoptosis, the cowpox virus crmA gene, which encodes a serpin that inhibits the enzymatic activity of ICE(19Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesen G.S. Pickup D.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). CrmA was found to be a potent inhibitor of both TNF- and Fas-induced apoptosis(20Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), suggesting that ICE or a related CrmA-inhibitable protease is a component of the death pathway activated by these receptors. These findings were recently confirmed by two other groups(21Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 22Los M. Craen M.V.D. Penning L.C.

Although the CrmA experiments implicated protease involvement in Fas- and TNF-R-induced cell death, they did not identify specific substrates cleaved during this process. Casciola-Rosen et al.(23Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that the 70-kDa protein component of the U1 small ribonucleoprotein (U1-70 kDa) was cleaved during apoptosis induced by UVB irradiation or nutrient deprivation of HeLa cells(23Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage appeared to be mediated by an enzyme with a chemical inhibitor profile characteristic of an ICE-like protease but was distinct from ICE, since purified ICE did not cleave U1-70 kDa(23Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies prompted us to ask whether cleavage of U1-70 kDa occurred during Fas- and/or TNF-R-induced apoptosis and if CrmA could block this event. We now show that proteolytic cleavage of U1-70 kDa occurs remarkably early during Fas- and TNF-R-induced apoptosis and is potently blocked by native CrmA but not by a CrmA point mutant that is incapable of inhibiting ICE. Taken together, these data identify U1-70 kDa as a death substrate in the Fas- and TNF-induced apoptosis pathways and suggest that the cleavage may be generated by a CrmA-inhibitable, ICE-like protease.

MCF7 cells or derived transfectants were plated in 100-mm dishes at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/dish. On the 2nd day, cells were treated with TNF at 40 ng/ml for the indicated time periods. Following a PBS rinse, cells were harvested by scraping into 15 ml of PBS plus protease inhibitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml antipain, and 0.5 mg/ml pepstatin), recovered by centrifugation, and lysed in 2.5 ml of sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 M urea, 6% 2-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, and 0.003% bromphenol blue). In cases where nonadherent cells were present in the culture medium (e.g. at later time points), floating cells were also harvested by centrifugation and combined with the adherent cell pellet before lysis in sample buffer. BJAB cells or derived transfectants were aliquoted at a concentration of 5 × 105/ml into six-well dishes, with 4 ml in each well. The following day, cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody (250 ng/ml) for the indicated time periods, harvested by centrifugation, washed once with PBS plus protease inhibitors, and lysed in 2 ml of sample buffer. Immunoblotting to assess the state of U1-70 kDa was carried out similarly as described previously(23Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cell lysates (20 μl) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) by electroblotting. Blots were blocked at room temperature for 1 h using blocking buffer (10 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 3% bovine serum albumin). The U1-70 kDa affinity-purified antiserum was used at a 1:5000 dilution in blocking buffer and was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary reagent, a biotinylated goat anti-human IgG antibody (Southern Biotech), was used at a dilution of 1:6700 in blocking buffer and was incubated for 50 min at room temperature. The tertiary reagent, a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Southern Biotech), was used at a dilution of 1:10,000 in blocking buffer and was incubated at 30 min at room temperature. Visualization of signal was by electrochemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Recombinant TNF (specific activity, 6.27 × 107 units/mg) was a gift from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (clone CH-11, IgM) was obtained from PanVera (Madison, WI). The affinity-purified U1-70 kDa reactive antiserum was derived from human autoimmune sera and was a kind gift from Dr. Antony Rosen (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). To determine whether cleavage of U1-70 kDa is an event characteristic of either Fas- or TNF-R-induced apoptosis, we examined the BJAB human lymphoma cell line and the MCF7 human breast carcinoma cell line. The BJAB and MCF7 cells have been documented by confocal and electron microscopy to undergo genuine apoptotic cell death in response to agonist anti-Fas antibody or recombinant TNF, respectively(20Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). BJAB cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody or TNF for various time periods, and cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for the integrity of U1-70 kDa by immunoblotting. Treatment of Fas rapidly (as early as 1 h) induced U1-70 kDa cleavage to a ~40-kDa form (Fig. 1A), similar in size to the cleavage product described by Casciola-Rosen et al.(23Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in serum deprivation-induced and UVB irradiation-induced apoptosis. Activation of TNF receptors stimulated U1-70 kDa cleavage in MCF7 cells, though at a slower time course than that observed with anti-Fas in BJAB cells (Fig. 1B). Importantly, however, this delayed time course of cleavage paralleled the slower time course of cell death seen in response to TNF. Ligation of Fas on BJAB cells induces cell death within hours, whereas TNF requires at least overnight exposure. 2M. Tewari and V. M. Dixit, unpublished observations. In both cases U1-70 kDa cleavage was detectable at time points at which no gross morphological changes were discernible, indicating that this cleavage may represent an early event in the apoptotic cascade. The fact that U1-70 kDa cleavage was seen in response to both TNF and Fas indicated that these receptors activated a protease capable of cleaving U1-70 kDa protein. Since we had previously shown that the cowpox virus-encoded inhibitor of ICE and ICE-like proteases, CrmA, inhibits cell death induced by these receptors, we examined the effect of CrmA on this cleavage event. MCF7 and BJAB stable cell lines were selected that had been transfected with either vector alone, CrmA, or mutant CrmA expression plasmids, and comparable levels of protein expression were confirmed by Western analysis(24Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). The mutant CrmA plasmid encodes a point mutant (Thr291→ Arg change) in the reactive site loop. This alteration disables its protease-inhibitory capacity without affecting overall tertiary structure (24Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar) and thus serves as an important control. MCF7 and BJAB transfectants were treated with TNF or anti-Fas antibody, respectively, for varying time periods, after which the cells were lysed and the integrity of U1-70 kDa was assessed by immunoblotting. In the case of Fas-induced apoptosis, the non-expressing BJAB lines (clones V4, V1, and CrmA5) showed kinetics of U1-70 kDa cleavage (Fig. 2A) similar to that observed previously with the parental cell line. However, expression of wild-type CrmA (clones CrmA2 and CrmA3) markedly inhibited the cleavage (Fig. 2B), whereas mutant CrmA (clones 12 and 17) was inactive (Fig. 2C), allowing the cleavage to occur unabated. In the case of TNF-induced PCD, non-expressing MCF7 cell lines (clones V4 and CrmA2) showed obvious cleavage (Fig. 3A), whereas expression of CrmA (clones CrmA3 and CrmA4) potently inhibited this proteolytic event (Fig. 3B). Mutant CrmA (clones 1 and 2), however, was ineffective (Fig. 3C). In summary, we have shown that CrmA inhibits cleavage of U1-70 kDa during Fas- and TNF-R-induced cell death and, furthermore, that the protease-inhibitory activity of CrmA is required for this effect. These data lend additional support to the contention that Fas and TNF-R induce cell death by a common mechanism, since both appear to activate a CrmA-inhibitable protease and cause U1-70 kDa cleavage. The finding that CrmA, a protease inhibitor and antidote to Fas- and TNF-induced cell death, inhibits the cleavage of U1-70 kDa suggests that the protease responsible may be an obligatory component of the death pathway. An alternative possibility is that CrmA inhibits an ICE-like protease upstream of the one that actually cleaves U1-70 kDa. This possibility is also tantalizing, since it would imply that there exists an amplifiable cascade of at least two ICE-like proteases in the cell death pathway. It is important to note that the time course of U1-70 kDa cleavage parallels that of another proteolytic event recently reported to occur during Fas- or TNF-R-mediated apoptosis, the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)(24Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). This event, which is also CrmA-inhibitable, has been proposed by us to be catalyzed by the protease Yama, also known as CPP32β(24Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar). Yama is an ICE/Ced-3 family member that cleaves PARP in vitro to a characteristic 85-kDa apoptotic fragment. It will be of importance to determine if U1-70 kDa too is a substrate for Yama and, if so, whether the cleavage product generated is identical to that seen in Fas- and TNF-induced cell death. The contribution of U1-70 kDa cleavage to apoptosis is not clear at this juncture. Casciola-Rosen et al.(23Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30757-30760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that the cleavage may play a role in regulating RNA splicing during apoptosis. As several substrates have now been identified that are specifically cleaved during apoptosis, it is likely that U1-70 kDa cleavage may be one of multiple proteolytic events resulting in the irreversible molecular inactivation of the cell's biochemical machinery. Thus, cleavage of U1-70 kDa, together with that of other identified death substrates such as fodrin (28Martin S.J. O'Brien G.A. Nishioka W.K. McGahon A.J. Mahboubi A. Saido T.C. Green D.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2073873696,"We have analyzed two human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase mutants of helix H in the thumb subdomain suggested by x-ray crystallography to interact with the primer strand of the template-primer. These enzymes, G262A and W266A, were previously shown to have greatly elevated dissociation rate constants for template-primer and to be much less sensitive to inhibition by 3'-azidodeoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate. Here we describe their processivity and error specificity. The results reveal that: (i) both enzymes have reduced processivity and lower fidelity for template-primer slippage errors, (ii) they differ from each other in sequence-dependent termination of processive synthesis and in error specificity, and (iii) the magnitude of the mutator effect relative to wild-type enzyme for deletions in homopolymeric sequences decreases as the length of the run increases. Thus amino acid substitutions in a subdomain thought to interact with the duplex template-primer confer a strand slippage mutator phenotype to a replicative DNA polymerase. This suggests that interactions between specific amino acids and the primer stem at positions well removed from the active site are critical determinants of processivity and fidelity. These effects, obtained in aqueous solution during catalytic cycling, are consistent with and support the existing crystallographic structural model."

In the cytoplasm of epidermal cells, the primary function of keratin filaments is to provide the strength necessary to maintain integrity when skin is subjected to mechanical stress.

In contrast to many other keratins, the pairwise expression of K6 and its type I partners K16 and/or K17 is not linked with a well defined program of terminal differentiation(1Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar, 4O'Guin W.M. Schermer A. Lynch M. Sun T-T. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 301-334Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, K6 is constitutively expressed in distinct types of epithelia, such as filiform papillae of tongue, several “wet” stratified epithelia lining the oral mucosa and esophagus, the outer root sheath of hair follicles, and in glandular epithelia(11Moll R. Moll I. Wiest W. Differentiation. 1982; 23: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 12Moll R. Krepler R. Franke W.W.

Differentiation. 1987; 35: 236-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). With the exception of specific body sites, e.g. palm and sole, K6 is not expressed in epidermis unless it undergoes enhanced proliferation or abnormal differentiation (15Weiss R.A. Eichner R. Sun T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 16Tyner A.L. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 17Stoler A. Kopan R. Duvic M. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 427-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). K6 and K16 are in fact best known for their induction in epidermis and other stratified epithelia undergoing hyperproliferation, e.g. during wound healing, in several diseases (e.g. psoriasis, actinic keratosis) and in cancer(12Moll R. Krepler R. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1983; 23: 256-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 15Weiss R.A. Eichner R. Sun T.T. J.

Likewise, K6 induction also occurs when epidermal, corneal, and tracheal cells are seeded in primary culture in vitro(4O'Guin W.M. Schermer A. Lynch M. Sun T-T. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 301-334Crossref Google Scholar, 7Schermer A. Jester J.V. Hardy C. Milano D. Sun T.T.

Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The association between a faster cell turnover rate and K6 expression in stratified epithelia is intriguing, given that expression occurs post-mitotically and can be uncoupled from mitosis in cultured keratinocytes(7Schermer A. Jester J.V. Hardy C. Milano D. Sun T.T. Differentiation. 1989; 42: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Kopan R. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The function(s) that K6 may play in stratified epithelia displaying an enhanced mitotic activity and during wound healing remain to be defined.Another characteristic of K6 is the existence of two functional genes encoding highly related protein isoforms in the human(16Tyner A.L. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), bovine (19Blessing M. Zentgraf H. Jorcano J.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and mouse (20Rothnagel J.A. Seki T. Longley M.A. Holder R. Bundman D. Adachi K. Roop D.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101 (Abstr. 235): 563Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) genomes. Of the two known human K6 isoform genes, K6a is more abundantly expressed than K6b at the mRNA level in skin explant cultures(21Tyner A.L. Eichman M.J. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). While the human K6b gene has been characterized (21Tyner A.L. Eichman M.J. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), only a partial cDNA is available for human K6a(22Hanukoglu I. Fuchs E. Cell. 1983; 33: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). As part of our efforts to understand the role(s) of K6 in hyperproliferative stratified epithelia, we cloned and characterized the human K6a gene and cDNA. While doing so, we discovered the existence of hitherto unknown functional K6 genes in the human genome. The K6 genes and cDNAs we isolated are predicted to encode five or six highly related K6 isoforms, and are differentially regulated in several epithelial cells and tissues examined. We are also proposing a model for the evolution of human K6 genes. While the functional consequences of this remarkable sequence multiplicity have yet to be determined, our findings have direct implications for an understanding of the function of K6 during wound healing as well as the search for point mutations in K6 sequences in the human population.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMaterials were obtained from the following sources: λDashII, λZapII, pBluescript vector, and Gigapack Gold II from Stratagene; restriction endonucleases and DNA modifying enzymes from New England Biolabs; Moloney murine leukemia virus, and Superscript II reverse transcriptases from Life Technologies, Inc.; oligo(dT)-Latex from Roche; Nytran from Schleicher & Schuell; Biodyne nylon membrane from Pall Ultrafine Filtration Corp.; GeneScreen Plus from Dupont. Cell culture medium, fetal bovine serum, glutamine, and antibiotics were purchased from BioWhittaker. All other chemicals were of reagent grade.Human Tissues and Construction of LibrariesDNA was extracted from human placenta and used for the construction of a genomic library. A skin cDNA library was constructed from poly(A) mRNAs extracted from a squamous cell carcinoma of the lower leg (with adjacent normal tissue) obtained from a patient (excision surgery). Other human tissues were obtained as discarded material in the course of surgery or at autopsy.Cell CultureSCC-13, a human skin squamous cell carcinoma line(23Wu Y.J. Parker L.M. Binder N.E.

Cell. 1982; 31: 693-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), was grown on a NIH 3T3 fibroblast feeder layer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. SCC-4 and SCC-9, two human tongue squamous cell carcinoma lines (23Wu Y.J. Parker L.M. Binder N.E. Beckett M.A. Sinard J.H. Griffiths C.T. Rheinwald J.G. Cell. 1982; 31: 693-703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), were grown in 1:1 mixture of Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone. PtK-2, a kangaroo rat kidney cell line(24Franke W.W. Schmid E. Osborn M. Weber K. Cytobiologie. 1978; 17: 391-411Google Scholar), was grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. All cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.Human Genomic DNA Library ScreeningWe used a human genomic library constructed in the λDashII cloning vector (25Takahashi K. Tanaka A. Hara M. Nakanishi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) to screen for human K6 genes. Approximately 1.5 × 106 phage clones were screened with DNA probes radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP. The initial screening was done using three probes on replicated filters: a 483-bp ApaI fragment derived from exon 1 and a 286-bp RsaI-SacI fragment from the 3′ non-coding region of the cloned human K6b gene(21Tyner A.L. Eichman M.J. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); and a 216-bp AluI-SpeI fragment from the 3′ non-coding region of the cloned human partial K6a cDNA(22Hanukoglu I. Fuchs E. Cell. 1983; 33: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out under stringent conditions at 65°C in 1 M NaCl, 10% dextran sulfate, and 1% SDS. Filter washing was performed at 65°C in 0.1 × saline sodium citrate (SSC; 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate). Hybridization-positive clones were isolated by repeated plaque purification using standard procedures(26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNAs extracted from the purified phage clones were analyzed by restriction digests and Southern blotting using probes corresponding to one or several exons of the human K6b gene. DNA fragments expected to contain an exon or exons on the basis of blot-hybridization analysis were isolated and subcloned into pBluescript SK(+). DNA sequencing was carried out as described (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52361) Google Scholar). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared using the DNASIS-Mac 2.0 software using the simple homology routine (Hitachi Software Engineering Co.).Human Skin cDNA Library ScreeningTo obtain human K6 cDNA clones, we screened a human cDNA library constructed using poly(A) RNA extracted from a leg skin squamous cell carcinoma. After oligo(dT)-driven reverse transcription and second-strand cDNA synthesis, EcoRI adapters were ligated, and fractions containing cDNAs of 2-5 kb were inserted into a λZap II vector. A total of 1.4 × 106 cDNA clones were screened at high stringency (0.1 × SSC, 65°C) with two different probes derived from exon 1 of the human K6a gene isolated in this study (a ~450-bp XhoI-NarI and a ~500-bp ApaI fragment). Positive cDNA clones were further analyzed by oligonucleotide hybridization, PCR, and DNA sequencing. Oligonucleotide hybridization was used to discriminate among K6 isoform cDNAs on the basis of codon 155 sequence (encoding either Ala or Thr, depending on the isoform). The antisense oligonucleotides used were: probe A (Table 1), to detect the K6a isoform (Thr155); and probe B (Table 1), to detect all other K6 isoforms (Ala155; see “Results”). Isolated K6 cDNA clones were blotted onto nylon membrane, and hybridization with probes A or B was carried out at 37°C in 5 × SSC, 30% formamide, and washed in a 0.5 × SSC, 0.5% SDS solution at 60°C. cDNA clones hybridizing positively with probe A or B were purified and rescued into pBluescript SK(-) for analysis.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Northern Blot Analysis and Primer-extension AnalysesRNAs were isolated from primary cultures of human skin keratinocytes and several human epithelial carcinoma cell lines by the acid-phenol extraction method(28Bessho Y. Nakanishi S. Nawa H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 18: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These RNA samples were subjected to Northern analysis using genomic DNA fragments from the 3′ non-coding sequence of the K6a and K6b genes as probes. For primer-extension analysis of the K6a mRNA, we used an oligodeoxynucleotide primer specific for the 5′ leader sequence of the K6a mRNA (K6a in Table 1). The primer was labeled with 32P at its 5′ end (2.0-5.0 × 104 cpm), hybridized to total RNA (20 μg) for 4 h at 30°C, and the mixture was subjected to reverse transcription as described previously (25Takahashi K. Tanaka A. Hara M. Nakanishi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The primer-extended products were electrophoresed along with the corresponding sequencing reaction on a 7 M urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel.Quantitation of K6 Isoform mRNA Levels by a Colony Hybridization AssaymRNAs were extracted from various human tissues and epithelial cell lines (see above), primed with oligo(dT), and cDNA synthesis was carried out in vitro(26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Small aliquots of cDNA products were used for PCR reactions (94°C for 40 s; 54°C for 40 s; 72°C for 60 s; total of 30 cycles) with a set of universal K6 primers, 5′ K6-primer, and 3′ K6-primer (Table 1). The target sequences of these two primers are perfectly conserved among the K6 isoform genes isolated (K6 a, b, c, d) and cDNAs (K6 a, b, e, f), and amplify a 636-bp long fragment encompassing exons 1 and 2. PCR products were subcloned, and transformants were transferred on several duplicate nylon membranes and grown on LB plates for use in a colony hybridization assay. Membranes were hybridized with oligonucleotide probes A and B (Table 1). Selective hybridization with probe A indicated the K6a isoform, while hybridization with probe B indicated the K6 b, c, d, e, or f isoform. These isoforms were discriminated by hybridization of duplicate filters with individual oligonucleotide probes C, D, E, F, and G (see Table 1). Optimal washing conditions for all the oligoprobes were determined using appropriate control DNAs. Under 0.5 × SSC and 42°C conditions, each probe was found to hybridize specifically with the expected purified isoform cDNA(s). Following autoradiography, each clone was scored for positive hybridization with oligonucleotide probes A-G. Hybridization with probe A indicated the K6a isoform; hybridization with probes D and F indicated either the K6b or K6f isoform; hybridization with probes C, E, and G indicated the K6c isoform; and hybridization with probes F and G indicated either the K6d or K6e isoform. Because our K6d genomic cloned lacked 198 bp at the 5′ end (see “Results”), we could not use probe C to distinguish it from the K6e isoform.Transient Expression of K6 IsoformsGenomic DNA fragments containing the entire coding sequence of the human K6a gene (~8-kbp EcoRI fragment), K6b (~18-kbp SalI fragment), and the K6c gene (~20-kbp SalI fragment) were subcloned into a cytomegalovirus vector (29Compton D.A. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) containing a cytomegalovirus promoter-enhancer and a SV40 polyadenylation signal. Transient transfection assays were done in PtK2 epithelial cells (24Franke W.W. Schmid E. Osborn M. Weber K. Cytobiologie. 1978; 17: 391-411Google Scholar) cultured on glass coverslips, using the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (30Letai A. Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1181-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). At 72 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in absolute methanol (−20°C, 15 min) and processed for indirect immunofluorescence (30Letai A. Coulombe P.A. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1181-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The primary antisera used were a rabbit polyclonal anti-K6 (17Stoler A. Kopan R. Duvic M. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 427-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and L2A1, a mouse monoclonal anti-K8/K18(31Chou C.F. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4465-4472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bound primary antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labs), and a biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard and Perry Labs) followed by streptavidin-Texas Red conjugate (Vector Labs).RESULTSIsolation of Multiple Human Genes Encoding Keratin 6We first performed Southern blot analyses of human genomic DNA using probes derived from the previously characterized human K6b gene(21Tyner A.L. Eichman M.J. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When digested human DNAs were probed with a ~600-bp NcoI fragment corresponding to the coding portion of the human K6b gene exon 1, nearly 10 hybridization bands were apparent (data not shown). This NcoI fragment, however, also hybridized with the human K5 gene, even under stringent washing conditions. When a smaller (283 bp) NcoI-NarI fragment derived from the K6b gene exon 1 (which does not hybridize with the K5 gene) was used under stringent conditions (0.1 × SSC, 70°C), between three and five strong hybridization signals were detected in digested genomic DNAs from several randomly selected individuals (Fig. 1). These results suggested the existence of additional K6 isoform genes or K6-related gene(s) in the human genome.We screened a human genomic DNA library to isolate the human K6a gene as well as any other K6-encoding genes. A total of 1.5 × 106 clones were screened with various 32P-labeled cDNA probes derived from the coding sequence of the cloned human K6b gene(21Tyner A.L. Eichman M.J. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Over 100 clones were found to hybridize strongly under stringent conditions with a probe derived from K6b exon 1. Of these, 57 independent clones were isolated by repeated plaque purification, and analyzed by hybridization under stringent conditions with probes derived from the 3′ non-coding regions of the human K6b gene and K6a partial cDNA(21Tyner A.L. Eichman M.J. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Hanukoglu I. Fuchs E. Cell. 1983; 33: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This revealed that 30 clones hybridized with the K6a 3′ non-coding probe (group 1), 7 clones hybridized with the K6b 3′ non-coding probe (group 2), while the remaining 20 clones did not hybridize with either probe (group 3). Each group of genomic clones was further analyzed by digestion of purified phage DNAs and their hybridization with specific fragments from the K6b gene. Based on this analysis, the genomic clones in groups 1 and 3 could be further divided into three and four subgroup(s), respectively. Subsequently, hybridization-positive restriction fragments were isolated from representative clones in each of the 8 subgroups, subcloned into pBluescript SK(+), and analyzed by DNA sequencing. The sequence data obtained was compared with those reported for the human K6a partial cDNA and K6b gene(21Tyner A.L. Eichman M.J. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Hanukoglu I. Fuchs E. Cell. 1983; 33: 915-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Group 1 clones, which hybridized to the K6a 3′ non-coding probe and included three restriction mapping subgroups, consisted of the human K6a gene and two novel K6-encoding genes, named K6c and K6d. Subsequent analyses indicated that these three genes shared virtually identical 3′ non-coding sequences (see below). Group 2 clones, which hybridized to the K6b 3′ non-coding probe, were independent isolates of the human K6b gene. The four subgroups identified among group 3 clones were found to include: (i) another potential K6-encoding gene (albeit partial); (ii) the K5 gene; and (iii) two full-length genes whose sequence display features characteristic of both the human K5 and K6 genes, designated K5/6-α and K5/6-β.Structural Organization of Keratin 6-Encoding Human Genes and Characterization of Their mRNAsWe completed the sequencing of the coding region, 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences and intron-exon junctions of the genomic clones potentially encoding K6-like proteins. Comparison of these sequences with the previously reported human K6b gene sequence (21Tyner A.L. Eichman M.J. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) enabled us to locate all exons and define the 5′ regulatory sequences. Overlapping phage clones yielded full-length genes for K6a, K6b, and K6c, and restriction digestion/Southern blotting analyses of suitable phage clones allowed us to assign each of them to a specific hybridization product in human genomic DNAs processed in parallel (Fig. 1). The K6d genomic clone, on the other hand, lacked 198 bp at the 5′ end of exon 1, thus preventing assignment to a specific product in digested human genomic DNA. All K6 isoform genes except one are ~6-7 kbp long (Fig. 2) and thus are analogous to other known human type II keratin genes(21Tyner A.L. Eichman M.J. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Lersch R. Stellmach V. Stocks C. Giudice G. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, the K6c gene is remarkably long for a type II keratin gene, extending over 17 kbp. The K6 genes all contain nine exons interrupted by eight introns. The position of all eight introns (A-H) is identical in the K6a, K6c, and K6d genes and in the previously characterized human K6b, K7, and K5 genes(21Tyner A.L. Eichman M.J. Fuchs E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4683-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 32Lersch R. Stellmach V. Stocks C. Giudice G. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell.

The introns are located within the protein-coding regions, and the sequences of the exon-intron boundaries conform to the consensus splicing signal(36Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1956) Google Scholar). From restriction map"

https://openalex.org/W2017726307,"A rapid, sensitive, and facile method for screening and characterizing anti-polysialic acid (polySia) antibodies using lipid-conjugated oligo/polysialic acids (oligo/polySia) was developed, which is based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Homooligo/polymers of α2→8-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), N-glycolylneuraminic acid, and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) were conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine dipalmitoyl (PE) by reductive amination to prepare neo-oligo/polysialoglycolipids (oligo/polySia-PE). Using this method, the anti-polySia equine antibody, H.46, bound to (→8Neu5Acα2→)n-PE, where n = 9 or more residues, a result in confirmation of previous binding studies using radiolabeled oligo/polyNeu5Ac. The antigenic specificity and sensitivity of two monoclonal anti-poly/oligoNeu5Ac antibodies (mAb.12E3 and mAb.5A5) and one anti-oligoKDN antibody (mAb.kdn8kdn), were also determined. mAb.12E3 could detect as little as 25 pg/well of oligo/polyNeu5Ac-PE, while mAb.5A5 and polyclonal antibody H.46 required at least 0.4 ng/well of oligo/polyNeu5Ac-PE to be detected. mAb.kdn8kdn detected as little as 12 ng/well of oligoKDN-PE. Using a series of oligo/polySia-PE with defined degrees of polymerization (DP), the minimum chain length for immunoreactivity of the anti-polySia antibodies was determined to be: DP 5 for mAb.12E3; DP 3 for mAb.5A5; DP 2 for mAb.kdn8kdn; and DP 8 for H.46. Thus, mAb.12E3 and mAb.5A5 recognize shorter oligomers of Neu5Ac than H.46, a finding that is of practical value for identifying shorter oligoSia chains in glycoconjugates. Because mAb.12E3 and mAb.5A5 also recognize extended polySia chains, these antibodies cannot be used, however, to differentiate between short and long chains of polySia when both are expressed on the same molecule. A rapid, sensitive, and facile method for screening and characterizing anti-polysialic acid (polySia) antibodies using lipid-conjugated oligo/polysialic acids (oligo/polySia) was developed, which is based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Homooligo/polymers of α2→8-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), N-glycolylneuraminic acid, and 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-galacto-nononic acid (KDN) were conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine dipalmitoyl (PE) by reductive amination to prepare neo-oligo/polysialoglycolipids (oligo/polySia-PE). Using this method, the anti-polySia equine antibody, H.46, bound to (→8Neu5Acα2→)n-PE, where n = 9 or more residues, a result in confirmation of previous binding studies using radiolabeled oligo/polyNeu5Ac. The antigenic specificity and sensitivity of two monoclonal anti-poly/oligoNeu5Ac antibodies (mAb.12E3 and mAb.5A5) and one anti-oligoKDN antibody (mAb.kdn8kdn), were also determined. mAb.12E3 could detect as little as 25 pg/well of oligo/polyNeu5Ac-PE, while mAb.5A5 and polyclonal antibody H.46 required at least 0.4 ng/well of oligo/polyNeu5Ac-PE to be detected. mAb.kdn8kdn detected as little as 12 ng/well of oligoKDN-PE. Using a series of oligo/polySia-PE with defined degrees of polymerization (DP), the minimum chain length for immunoreactivity of the anti-polySia antibodies was determined to be: DP 5 for mAb.12E3; DP 3 for mAb.5A5; DP 2 for mAb.kdn8kdn; and DP 8 for H.46. Thus, mAb.12E3 and mAb.5A5 recognize shorter oligomers of Neu5Ac than H.46, a finding that is of practical value for identifying shorter oligoSia chains in glycoconjugates. Because mAb.12E3 and mAb.5A5 also recognize extended polySia chains, these antibodies cannot be used, however, to differentiate between short and long chains of polySia when both are expressed on the same molecule."

This is small, well-defined region on each of the two alpha subunits, containing residues 67-76 (alpha 67-76). By determining the structure of the ACh receptor complexed with two different fragments of an MIR-directed antibody, we have determined the three-dimensional location of the MIR (and therefore residues alpha 67-76) to be at the extreme synaptic end of each alpha subunit. The antibody fragments extend from the binding site away from the receptor axis and into the synaptic cleft, minimizing any steric interference neighboring ACh receptors might have with their binding."

Pearson A. Krieger M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of the mature CD6 protein is composed of three SRCR domains followed by a short 33-amino-acid stalk region. This extracellular domain is anchored to the cell membrane via a short hydrophobic domain followed by a cytoplasmic domain of variable length (2Aruffo A. Melnick M.B. Linsley P.S. Seed B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 949-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cloning of cDNAs encoding the murine homologue of CD6 (mCD6) and comparison of its predicted amino sequence with that of the human clone revealed the possible existence of multiple CD6 isoforms which result from the variable splicing of exons encoding the cytoplasmic domain (3Whitney G. Bowen M. Neubauer M. Aruffo A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 32: 89-92Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Within the SRCR family of proteins, CD6 is most closely related to CD5(1Resnick D. Pearson A. Krieger M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These two proteins share a similar extracellular domain organization and are both expressed by thymocytes, T cells, B cell CLLs, and a subset of normal B cells.Antibody cross-linking studies have shown that CD6 can function as an accessory molecule in T cell activation. For example, the anti-CD6 mAb 2H1 can induce T cell activation in conjunction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or with the anti-CD2 mAb T113(4Morimoto C. Rudd C.E. Letvin N.L. Hagan M. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2165-2170PubMed Google Scholar). On T cells, ligation of CD6 with the anti-CD6 mAb G3-5 causes an increase in CD3-induced cytoplasmic calcium concentration (5Ledbetter J.A. Norris N.A. Grossmann A. Grosmaire L.S. June C.H.

This last observation suggests that the cytoplasmic domain of CD6 may provide a membrane anchor for interaction with SH2-containing proteins involved in intracellular signaling.Studies using CD6 Rg, an immunoglobulin fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domains of CD6 fused to human IgG1 constant domains, resulted in the identification of cells which express a CD6 ligand(11Wee S.F.

Med. 1995; 181: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).Herein we present the results of experiments designed to determine whether binding to ALCAM can be localized to a single domain of CD6. Two independent approaches were used: first, a series of CD6 Rg fusion proteins containing different CD6 extracellular domains, alone or in combinations, were used in cell and protein binding assays; second, mAbs directed against different CD6 extracellular domains were used to block CD6 ALCAM binding and provided independent evidence for which CD6 domain(s) is responsible for ALCAM binding. The results obtained from both of these experimental approaches indicated that the membrane-proximal SRCR domain of CD6 contains the ALCAM binding site.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines, Tissue Culture, and AntibodiesThe human T cell line HPB-ALL was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in culture in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum. The preparation and characterization of the rat anti-mCD6 mAbs M6-1A.1, M6-3A.1, and M6-3B.1 mAbs will be described elsewhere. 2G. C. Starling, manuscript in preparation. All three mAbs bound to murine thymocytes as determined by flow cytometry analysis. Analysis of which domains contained the epitope recognized by each mAb was determined by examining the binding pattern of the mAbs on the mCD6 Rg fusion proteins by ELISA. M6-1A.1 bound to mCD6 Rg, mCD6D1-2 Rg, and mCD6D1 Rg but did not bind mCD6D2-S Rg, mCD6D2 Rg, or mCD6D3 Rg. M6-3A.1 and M6-3B.1 each bound mCD6 Rg, mCD6D2-3 Rg, and mCD6D3 Rg but not mCD6D1-2 Rg, mCD6D1 Rg, or mCD6D2 Rg. We therefore concluded that M6-1A.1 recognizes mCD6 SRCR-D1 and that both M6-3A.1 and M6-3B.1 recognize mCD6 SRCR-D3.Murine CD6 Rg ConstructsComplementary DNA fragments encoding individual or groups of mCD6 extracellular domains were obtained by polymerase chain reaction. The mCD6 fusion protein contains bases 119-1181 of the mCD6 cDNA (3Whitney G. Bowen M. Neubauer M. Aruffo A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 32: 89-92Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) fused to a cDNA fragment encoding the hinge, CH2, and CH3 domains of human IgG1(19Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar). The mCD6D1, mCD6D2, mCD6D3, mCD6D1-2, mCD6D2-3, mCD6D1-3, mCD6D2-S, and mCD6D3-S fusions contain mCD6 bases 119-468, 469-775, 776-1081, 119-775, 469-1081, 119-1081, 469-1181, and 776-1181, respectively. To ensure that no mutations were introduced by the procedure, all chimeric genes were sequenced. In all cases, the amino-terminal secretory signal sequence used in these chimeric constructs was derived from the human CD5 gene. The fusion proteins were produced by transient expression in COS cells and were purified by adsorption and elution from a protein A-Sepharose column. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford dye-binding procedure (Bio-Rad) and verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Binding AssaysGoat anti-mouse IgG (4 μg/ml, Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was coated on 96-well plastic dishes overnight at room temperature. After washing to remove excess antibody, ALCAM Rg (2 μg/ml) was added. The ALCAM Rg fusion protein used for these studies contains a murine IgG domain. Dilutions of mCD6 Rg fusion proteins (7.5 ng/ml-1.0 μg/ml) and control CD7 Rg were added and allowed to bind to the immobilized ALCAM Rg. After washing, the bound mCD6 Rg and CD7 Rg fusion proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson Laboratories). Absorbance readings were taken at 450 nm and 630 nm. Standard deviations were calculated on the basis of three independent binding measurements.HPB-ALL cells (5 × 105) were labeled with 20 μg/ml purified fusion protein for 1 h at 4°C. Cells were washed and subsequently labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-human IgG (Tago, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min at 4°C and washed. The level of fusion protein binding was determined by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton-Dickinson).Antibody Blocking ExperimentsThe ability of the anti-mCD6 mAbs to inhibit the binding of ALCAM Rg to mCD6 was examined using murine thymocytes obtained from C57BL/6 mice. In each assay, 5 × 105 cells were incubated with 50 μl of conditioned media obtained from each of the hybridomas producing the anti-mCD6 mAbs or from a hybridoma producing a rat anti-human gp39 mAb as a negative control for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were washed and stained with 20 μg/ml human ALCAM Rg for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were then washed and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate-donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson Laboratories) with minimal cross-reactivity to rat and bovine IgG. The cells were then washed and subsequently analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan.RESULTSMapping of the CD6 ALCAM Binding SiteThe extracellular region of mature CD6 can be divided into four domains, three consecutive SRCR domains (D1-D3) followed by a 33-amino-acid membrane proximal “stalk” (S) domain. To determine which of these domains contains the ALCAM binding site, we prepared six different mCD6 immunoglobulin fusion proteins (Rg, recombinant globulins) which contain different mCD6 domains alone or in combinations: mCD6 Rg which contains the complete extracellular domain of CD6 or mCD6D1 Rg, mCD6D2 Rg, mCD6D3-S Rg, CD6D1-2 Rg, and CD6D2-S Rg (Fig. 1A). These mCD6 Rg fusion proteins were prepared by transient expression in COS cells and purified by adsorption to and elution from a protein A-Sepharose column (Fig. 1B).We had previously shown that hCD6 Rg, an immunoglobulin fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of human CD6, was capable of binding to murine cells lines(11Wee S.F. Wang W.-C. Farr A.G. Nelson A.J. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Linsley P.S. Aruffo A. Cell Immunol. 1994; 158: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here we show that mCD6 Rg is capable of binding ALCAM expressed on the human T cell line HPB-ALL (Fig. 2A) or to ALCAM Rg, an immunoglobulin fusion protein which contains the extracellular domain of human ALCAM (Fig. 2B)(13Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Li X. Modrell B. Malacko A.R. Wang W.-C. Marquardt H. Neubauer M. Pesando J.M. Francke U. Haynes B.F. Aruffo A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The ability of mCD6 to bind to human ALCAM allowed us to use the mCD6 Rg fusion proteins described above in two different binding assays to identify the mCD6 extracellular subdomain(s) responsible for ALCAM binding. In the first assay, the binding of mCD6 Rg to HPB-ALL cells was compared with that of the different mCD6 Rg domain fusion proteins by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2A, the binding of mCD6D2-S Rg and mCD6D3-S Rg to the HPB-ALL cells was comparable to that of mCD6 Rg. On the other hand, mCD6D1 Rg, mCD6D2 Rg, and mCD6D1-2 Rg as well as our control fusion protein mCD7 Rg failed to bind to the HBP-ALL cells. Similar results were obtained when the ability of the mCD6 Rg fusion proteins to bind to purified ALCAM Rg was examined by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2B, fusion proteins containing CD6 SRCR-D3 and S domains bound ALCAM Rg. In addition, similar results were obtained when the ability of the mCD6 Rg fusion proteins to bind to COS cells transfected with a plasmid containing a cDNA encoding ALCAM was examined (data not shown). These results suggest that the ALCAM binding site in CD6 is contained in the membrane-proximal region of the protein which contains the SRCR-D3 and S domains of CD6.Figure 2:Binding of the mCD6 Rgs to HPB-ALL cells or ALCAM Rg.

HPB-ALL (FACS) and ALCAM Rg (ELISA) binding studies with this set of fusion proteins showed that the membrane-proximal SRCR domain of CD6 alone can bind ALCAM (Fig. 2). Taken together these data suggest that the CD6 SRCR-D3 domain is necessary for CD6-ALCAM binding.Blocking of CD6-ALCAM Interactions by Domain-specific Anti-CD6 AntibodiesRecently we prepared a number of rat anti-mCD6 mAbs. The ability of these mAbs to bind to the different CD6 Rg domain constructs was examined.2 These studies allowed the identification of domain-specific anti-mCD6 mAbs. Three anti-mCD6 mAbs were selected for blocking studies. One of these antibodies recognizes the CD6 SRCR-D1 (M6-1A.1), the other two (M6-3A.1 and M6-3B.1) recognize CD6 SRCR-D3. As shown in Fig. 3, mAb M6-3A.1 completely blocked the ability of ALCAM Rg to bind murine thymocytes expressing CD6. MAb M6-3B.1 was able to partially block while M6-1A.1 blocked only very weakly or not at all the binding of ALCAM Rg to murine thymocytes. As expected, an isotype-matched rat anti-human gp39 mAb used as a control was unable to block the binding of ALCAM Rg to murine thymocytes (Fig. 3). Inhibition of ALCAM binding to mCD6 by domain 3 but not domain 1 antibodies was confirmed by ELISA (data not shown). These results provide further evidence that the third SRCR domain of CD6 contains the ALCAM binding site.Figure 3:Blocking of the CD6-ALCAM interaction by domain-specific mAbs.

These profiles are a representative set derived from a group of two independent blocking assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONUsing immunoglobulin fusion proteins containing single or multiple extracellular domains of mCD6, we have mapped the ALCAM binding site to the membrane-proximal SRCR domain of CD6. Fusion proteins containing this domain are capable of binding ALCAM, and mAbs directed against this CD6 domain were found to block CD6-ALCAM binding. Taken together these results demonstrate that mCD6 SRCR-D3 is necessary for CD6 binding to ALCAM. However, these results do not rule out the possible contribution of other CD6 domains in CD6-ALCAM binding. Indeed we observed that some of the truncated fusion proteins containing SRCR-D3, such as mCD6D3 Rg and mCD6D1-3 Rg, bound ALCAM Rg less efficiently than the others (Fig. 2B. This might be the result of a loss of residues in other CD6 domains which directly contribute to ALCAM binding and/or due to structural perturbations of SRCR-D3 caused by the truncation of adjacent domains. In this regard, we also observed that mCD63-S Rg bound ALCAM as well as mCD6 Rg. This suggests that the S domain may play a more important role in ALCAM binding than SRCR-D1 or −D2 by either contributing directly to ALCAM binding, playing a structural role in facilitating CD6-ALCAM interactions, and/or by providing an appropriate spacer between the SRCR domain and the Ig portion of the fusion protein which allows efficient binding. These findings leave open the possibility that the other extracellular domains of mCD6, mCD6 SRCR-D1, and −D2, have other ligands.Indirect evidence for additional CD6 ligands is provided by immunoprecipitation studies of CD6 binding proteins from HBL-100 cells (11Wee S.F.

These studies showed that CD6 Rg bound to three proteins, only one of which had a molecular weight consistent with the predicted molecular weight of ALCAM(11Wee S.F. Wang W.-C. Farr A.G. Nelson A.J. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Linsley P.S. Aruffo A. Cell Immunol. 1994; 158: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Li X. Modrell B. Malacko A.R. Wang W.-C. Marquardt H. Neubauer M. Pesando J.M. Francke U. Haynes B.F. Aruffo A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Also, anti-CD6 mAbs which bind to different CD6 epitopes have different functional characteristics(4Morimoto C. Rudd C.E. Letvin N.L. Hagan M. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2165-2170PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gangemi R.M. Swack J.A. Gaviria D.M. Romain P.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2439-2447PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bott C.M. Doshi J.B. Morimoto C. Romain P.L. Fox D.A. Int. Immunol. 1993; 7: 783-792Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that CD6 has multiple ligands which might differentially regulate CD6 function(20Bott C.M. Doshi J.B. Morimoto C. Romain P.L. Fox D.A. Int. Immunol. 1993; 7: 783-792Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). There are a number of examples of leukocyte receptors which have multiple ligands. Perhaps one of the best studied is CD2 which has been found to interact with CD48, CD58, and CD59(21Hahn W.C. Menu E. Bothwell A.L. Sims P.J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 256: 1805-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Kato K. Koyanagi M. Okada H. Takanashi T. Wong Y.W. Williams A.F. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The CD6 fusion proteins described here may be useful for the identification of the biological function of the other CD6 subdomains. Binding studies with mCD6D1-2 Rg on different cell types are ongoing to explore the possibility that the SRCR-D1 and −D2 extracellular subdomains of CD6 interact with other ligands.Ligands for other members of the SRCR family of proteins have been reported. In particular, CD5 has been reported to bind CD72(23Luo W. Van de Velde H. von Hoegen I. Parnes J.R. Thielemans K. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1630-1634PubMed Google Scholar, 24Van de Velde H. von Hoegen I. Luo W. Parnes J.R. Thielemans K.

Bellet R.A. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2128-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and MARCO binds Escherichia coli and other bacteria (30Elomaa O. Kangas M.

In some cases, these receptor-ligand interactions do not involve the SRCR domain(s). This is exemplified by the interaction between the type I macrophage scavenger receptor and acetylated low density lipoprotein. In this case, receptor-ligand binding is not mediated through the SRCR domain(25Kodama T. Freeman L. Rohrer J. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). In other cases, indirect evidence for the role of the SRCR domain in receptor-ligand binding has been reported. As an example, in studies of the E. coli binding function of MARCO, polyclonal antiserum raised against sequences found in the SRCR domain of MARCO was found to inhibit binding to E. coli(30Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 80: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Presently it is not known if this effect is due to direct blocking of the ligand binding site or steric hindrance. However, in most cases, the role of the SRCR domain(s) in receptor-ligand interactions has not been examined. Our finding that CD6 SRCR-D3 binds ALCAM provides the first direct demonstration that an SRCR domain can participate in binding interactions. Future work defining the role of other SRCR domains in receptor-ligand binding will be required to determine the range of molecular interactions mediated by this well conserved protein domain. INTRODUCTIONCD6 is a type I cell surface protein and a member of the SRCR 1The abbreviations used are: SRCRscavenger receptor cysteine-richALCAMactivated leukocyte cell adhesion moleculemAbmonoclonal antibodyELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. family of proteins(1Resnick D. Pearson A. Krieger M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of the mature CD6 protein is composed of three SRCR domains followed by a short 33-amino-acid stalk region. This extracellular domain is anchored to the cell membrane via a short hydrophobic domain followed by a cytoplasmic domain of variable length (2Aruffo A. Melnick M.B. Linsley P.S. Seed B. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 949-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cloning of cDNAs encoding the murine homologue of CD6 (mCD6) and comparison of its predicted amino sequence with that of the human clone revealed the possible existence of multiple CD6 isoforms which result from the variable splicing of exons encoding the cytoplasmic domain (3Whitney G. Bowen M. Neubauer M. Aruffo A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 32: 89-92Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Within the SRCR family of proteins, CD6 is most closely related to CD5(1Resnick D. Pearson A. Krieger M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These two proteins share a similar extracellular domain organization and are both expressed by thymocytes, T cells, B cell CLLs, and a subset of normal B cells.Antibody cross-linking studies have shown that CD6 can function as an accessory molecule in T cell activation. For example, the anti-CD6 mAb 2H1 can induce T cell activation in conjunction with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or with the anti-CD2 mAb T113(4Morimoto C. Rudd C.E. Letvin N.L. Hagan M. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2165-2170PubMed Google Scholar). On T cells, ligation of CD6 with the anti-CD6 mAb G3-5 causes an increase in CD3-induced cytoplasmic calcium concentration (5Ledbetter J.A. Norris N.A. Grossmann A. Grosmaire L.S. June C.H. Uckun F.M. Cosand W.L. Rabinovitch P.S. Mol. Immunol. 1989; 26: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) while CD6 cross-linking with the anti-CD6 mAb T12 has been shown to enhance the activation mediated by suboptimal doses of anti-CD3 mAbs(6Gangemi R.M. Swack J.A. Gaviria D.M. Romain P.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2439-2447PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence for the role of CD6 in T cell activation comes from studies showing that CD6 becomes hyperphosphorylated on Ser and Thr residues (7Swack J.A. Gangemi R.M. Rudd C.E. Morimoto C.

Med. 1993; 177: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) following T cell activation. This last observation suggests that the cytoplasmic domain of CD6 may provide a membrane anchor for interaction with SH2-containing proteins involved in intracellular signaling.Studies using CD6 Rg, an immunoglobulin fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domains of CD6 fused to human IgG1 constant domains, resulted in the identification of cells which express a CD6 ligand(11Wee S.F.

The identification of these cells allowed the characterization (11Wee S.F. Wang W.-C. Farr A.G. Nelson A.J. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Linsley P.S. Aruffo A.

Abed M. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar), was named ALCAM. ALCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin supergene family and appears to be the human homologue of the chicken neural adhesion molecule BEN/SC-1/DM-GRASP (15Pourquie O. Corbel C. Le Caer J.-P.

ALCAM is a type I membrane protein composed of two amino-terminal V-set domains followed by three C2-set domains, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic anchor sequence. ALCAM is expressed by thymic epithelial (TE) cells (11Wee S.F. Wang W.-C. Farr A.G. Nelson A.J. Patel D.D. Haynes B.F. Linsley P.S. Aruffo A.

In addition, ALCAM is expressed by neurons in the brain(12Patel D.D. Wee S.-F. Whichard L.P. Bowen M.A. Pesando J.M. Aruffo A. Haynes B.F. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1563-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion assays demonstrated that CD6-ALCAM interactions are in part responsible for mediating thymocyte binding to TE cells(13Bowen M.A. Patel D.D. Li X. Modrell B. Malacko A.R. Wang W.-C.

Med. 1995; 181: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar).Herein we present the results of experiments designed to determine whether binding to ALCAM can be localized to a single domain of CD6. Two independent approaches were used: first, a series of CD6 Rg fusion proteins containing different CD6 extracellular domains, alone or in combinations, were used in cell and protein binding assays; second, mAbs directed against different CD6 extracellular domains were used to block CD6 ALCAM binding and provided independent evidence for which CD6 domain(s) is responsible for ALCAM binding. The results obtained from both of these experimental approaches indicated that the membrane-proximal SRCR domain of CD6 contains the ALCAM binding site."

Here we investigated the mechanism of activation of the Fas-encoding gene expression upon influenza virus infection. Nucleotide sequences for the binding of nuclear factor for interleukin-6 expression (NF-IL6), also known as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β, were repeated 8 times in the 5′-end region of the human FAS gene, spanning from −1360 to +320. This region directed the expression of a downstream marker gene when introduced into HeLa cells and the activity of the FAS gene promoter was stimulated about 2-fold upon influenza virus infection. Gene expression driven by the FAS promoter was activated when human NF-IL6 was overproduced in a DNA co-transfection study. Moreover, the DNA-binding activity of NF-IL6 increased after infection with the virus, whereas the amount of NF-IL6 seemed unchanged. The results suggest that NF-IL6 is activated upon influenza virus infection through post-translational modification and that the modified factor stimulates the transcription of the human FAS gene.

Viral infection brings about a variety of effects in host cells, including changes in growth and morphology, transformation, and lytic death, all of which presumably accompany the altered expression of cellular genes. Understanding the molecular basis for virus-host interaction should lead to the development of effective therapeutics against virus-induced diseases such as cancer and AIDS. Although it has been accepted for many years that most viruses cause host cell death, the precise mechanism for this phenomenon remains unknown. Several reports have shown that host cells infected with bovine herpesvirus (1Griebel P.J. Ohmann H.B. Lawman M.J.P. Babiuk L.A. J. Gen.

Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Google Scholar, 23Suda T. Nagata S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 873-879Google Scholar). Fas/Fas-ligand is the most characterized signaling system in eukaryotic apoptosis, and it is believed to play important roles in a variety of biological events such as the establishment and function of the immune system(24Nagata S. Tomei L.D. Cope F.O. Apoptosis II: The Molecular Basis of Apoptosis in Disease. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 313-326Google Scholar). We reported that human T cell lines become susceptible to the apoptosis trigger provided by an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody when they are chronically infected with HIV(25Kobayashi N. Hamamoto Y. Yamamoto N. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Yonehara S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9620-9624Google Scholar). Thus, an increase in the Fas concentration on the surface of virus-infected cells might be a key cause of the induction of apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of activation of the Fas-encoding gene upon influenza virus infection and obtained evidence for the involvement of the transcription factor, nuclear factor for interleukin-6 expression (NF-IL6). A human FAS cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-mediated polymerase chain reaction (26Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 21-27Google Scholar) using RNA from the human T cell lymphoma cell line KT-3(27Shimizu S. Takiguchi T. Sugai S. Matsuoka M. Konda S. Blood. 1988; 71: 196-203Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified DNA was identical to that reported previously(20Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Google Scholar). The cDNA was labeled with 32P by nick translation and used as a probe to screen a library. A genomic DNA library (28Tomatsu S. Kobayashi Y. Fukumaki Y. Yubisui T. Orii T. Sakaki Y. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 80: 353-361Google Scholar) constructed with the EMBL3 vector and DNA from human peripheral blood cells was obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank. About one-million clones were screened by hybridization with the labeled probe under standard conditions, and five were selected. These clones were further hybridized with a DNA fragment corresponding to the region between nucleotide positions 196 and 346 of FAS cDNA(20Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Google Scholar). Three clones gave positive signals and one of them, named EhFas7, contained the most 5′-end region of FAS cDNA. HeLa S3 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Nissui, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific). Subconfluent monolayers were infected with SP626, a wild-type strain of the influenza A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 as described previously (29Hatada E. Takizawa T. Fukuda R. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 17-25Google Scholar) or exposed to double-stranded poly(I)•poly(C) (Pharmacia Biotech, Japan) at 0.1 mg/ml. The cells were harvested for further analysis after various periods. An oligonucleotide containing the region between +171 and +187 of the FAS gene (see Fig. 2) was synthesized, labeled with 32P at the 5′-end, and used as a primer. RNA samples were mixed with the primer, and the cDNA was synthesized with a reverse transcriptase as described previously(30Jones K.A. Yamamoto K.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1985; 42: 559-572Google Scholar). The cDNA was separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3 M urea together with sequence ladders constructed by sequencing a DNA with the same primer. The DNA fragment corresponding to the region between −1435 and +236 of the FAS gene was inserted 18-base pairs upstream of the translation start codon of the firefly luciferase gene in the pGV-B vector (Toyo Ink, Japan), resulting in pFLF1. Various amounts of pFLF1 were introduced into HeLa cells using DEAE-dextran(31Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1985: 143-190Google Scholar), and the cells were cultured for 24 h. The cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase was assayed using the commercially supplied reagent, PicaGene (Toyo Ink). Luciferase activity was determined using a luminometer (Lumat LB9501, Berthold, Germany). HeLa cells were also transfected with pGV-B, and luciferase activity in the cell lysates was subtracted as background from that in the lysates of the pFLF1 transfectants. A DNA containing the promoter region of the human β-actin gene fused to the coding sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (β-actin/CAT) was introduced into HeLa cells together with pFLF1 as an internal control. The expression of β-actin/CAT was determined by the CAT enzyme assay as described previously(31Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Nuclear “mini-extracts” were prepared from HeLa cells (0.5-1 × 106)(32Schreiber E. Matthias P. Mller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar). A double-stranded oligonucleotide with the sequence of 5′-AGATTGTGCAATCT, which contained the consensus binding-sequence for NF-IL6, 5′-T(T/G)NNGNAA(T/G)(33Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Google Scholar), was labeled with 32P at the 5′-ends and used as a probe. Nuclear extracts (2 μl) were incubated on ice for 10 min in a reaction mixture consisting of 12 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 40 mM KCl, 120 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM EGTA, 0.4 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8% glycerol, and 0.1 mg/ml of poly[d(I•C)]•poly[d(I•C)] (Sigma). The probe (0.05 pmol) was then added to the mixture, and the binding reaction proceeded for 10 min on ice. The mixture was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 5% glycerol, and resolved by electrophoresis at 12.5 V/cm at 4°C in 25 mM Tris borate (pH 8.3) containing 0.5 mM EDTA. Oligonucleotide competitors (25-fold excess over the probe) were incubated with nuclear extracts before the probe was added. Oligo-AP4, 5′-CCAGCTGTGGAATG, contained the AP4-binding site of simian virus 40 DNA. Antibodies raised against synthetic peptides of the rat CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) (34Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes & Dev. 1991; 6: 1553-1567Google Scholar) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which cross-react with the human homolog, were added after the binding reaction was completed, and the mixture was further incubated for 1 h on ice. The intensity of the specific signal was determined using an image analyzer (BA100, Fuji Photo Film, Japan). A gel shift assay for nuclear factor I was similarly performed using an oligonucleotide with the sequence 5′-TATACCTTATACTGGACTAGTGCCAATATTAAAATG as a probe as described previously(35Kawamura H. Wada N. Makino Y. Tamura T. Koikeda S. Shiroki K. Masamune Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5056-5062Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Corp.). The membrane was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 0.1 μg/ml of anti-rat C/EBPβ immunoglobulin G in a buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20. The membrane was washed and reacted with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham, Corp.). Signals were then visualized using the ECL System (Amersham, Corp.). To determine the specificity of the reaction, the first antibody was initially incubated for 30 min with 0.2 μg/ml of either the peptide used to raise the antibody or that containing the region between amino acid positions 144 and 157 of human Fas(20Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence was determined for both strands by dideoxy chain termination(36Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) and poly(A)+ RNA was enriched by means of oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. Northern and Southern blots were performed under standard conditions. To obtain a DNA containing the transcription promoter of the human FAS gene, a genomic DNA library constructed with DNA from human peripheral blood cells was screened, using the human FAS cDNA as a probe. Five positive clones were selected from one million independent clones. One of them, named EhFas7, was further analyzed since it contained the most 5′-end region of the FAS cDNA. A restriction map of EhFas7 is shown in Fig. 1A. Various DNA regions of EhFas7 were used as probes against the RNA from KT-3 cells in a Northern blot. The 0.8-kilobase pair XhoI-HindIII fragment detected Fas mRNA, whereas more upstream regions failed to do so (data not shown, see Fig. 1A). We then searched for the transcription initiation site (+1) within this DNA segment. An oligo-DNA primer was constructed corresponding to a sequence within the region, and primer extension proceeded using the RNA from the human T cell line MOLT-4, which contains a relatively large amount of Fas mRNA (data not shown). A single extended product of about 190 bases was detected with the RNA that bound oligo(dT)-cellulose (Fig. 1B). The position of +1 was G, according to the sequence ladders. To eliminate the possibility that the EhFas7 clone was derived from a pseudogene, genomic Southern hybridization was performed using DNA from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a small fragment within the first exon as a probe (see Fig. 1A). The results in Fig. 1C show a single hybridizing band of the predicted size. This indicates that EhFas7 is not a pseudogene and that it contains the 5′-end region of the human FAS gene. The 2.2-kilobase pair HindIII-HindIII DNA fragment was then sequenced, and we found that this DNA contained the sequence corresponding to the region between nucleotide positions 1 and 226 of the FAS cDNA, which was flanked by an additional 132-base pair transcribed sequence (Fig. 2). The first exon (boxed) and part of the first intron were included in this clone. The proximal promoter region, 20-40-base pairs upstream of +1, did not possess TATA, GC, or CCAAT boxes, but there were sequences for the binding of AP-1, Ets, and NF-IL6 (also called C/EBPβ) in the more upstream region. AP-1- and Ets-binding sites were present at around −490, and there were six binding sequences for NF-IL6 in the region spanning from −130 to −1360. The first exon contained two more sequences for NF-IL6 binding. We examined whether the 5′-upstream region of the cloned FAS gene can direct the transcription of a downstream sequence. The region between −1435 and +236, which includes seven out of eight NF-IL6-binding sites, was fused to the coding sequence of the firefly luciferase gene, and various amounts of the resulting pFLF1 DNA were introduced into HeLa cells. The lysates from transfectants contained luciferase activity, and 5 μg of the DNA gave maximal expression (data not shown). The effect of influenza virus infection on the activity of the FAS promoter was then examined. HeLa cells were transfected with pFLF1 and cultured for 24 h. The cells were then infected with influenza virus, and lysates were prepared from the infected cells after various periods to determine the luciferase activity. The expression of the luciferase gene began to increase soon after infection, reaching a maximal stimulation of about 2-fold at 2 h postinfection, and then it gradually descended to the control level at 6 h postinfection (Fig. 3A). Transient stimulation of the FAS promoter coincides with an increase of the Fas mRNA in influenza virus-infected HeLa cells; the amount of Fas mRNA increases about 3-fold with a sharp peak at 3 h postinfection (18Takizawa T. Fukuda R. Miyawaki T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Moreover, the specificity of gene expression in virus-infected cells (18Takizawa T. Fukuda R. Miyawaki T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) was reproduced in a DNA transfection assay since the human β-actin promoter used as an internal negative control was little affected by influenza virus infection (Fig. 3B). Since the presence of dispersed multiple binding sites in transcription regulatory regions is typical of NF-IL6-inducible genes, we considered that NF-IL6 might be a transcription factor responsible for the activation of the FAS promoter in cells infected with influenza virus. We first established a gel shift assay to determine the DNA-binding activity of NF-IL6 using an oligo-DNA having the consensus sequence for NF-IL6 binding as a probe. Nuclear extracts of uninfected HeLa cells showed a shifted band, which disappeared only in the presence of an excess of the unlabeled probe (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-3). The formation of this specific complex was almost completely inhibited by an anti-C/EBPβ antibody, but it was not affected by an antibody raised against either C/EBPα or C/EBPδ (lanes 4-7). These results indicate that the binding activity in uninfected HeLa cells contains C/EBPβ, but not C/EBPα and C/EBPδ, suggesting that it consists of the homodimer of C/EBPβ (NF-IL6). NF-IL6 activity in HeLa cells markedly increased when HeLa cells were transfected with pEF-NFIL6 that expresses human NF-IL6(38Matsusaka T. Fujikawa K. Nishio Y. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10193-10197Google Scholar), while a control vector showed no effect (lanes 8-13). To assess whether NF-IL6 is involved in the transcription regulation of the human FAS gene, we transfected HeLa cells with pFLF1 and pEF-NFIL6, and luciferase activity in the lysates from transfectants was determined. Gene expression driven by the FAS promoter was significantly augmented in the presence of pEF-NFIL6, whereas the β-actin promoter, whose DNA was simultaneously introduced into HeLa cells, was not affected (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that NF-IL6 is a positive transcription factor for the human FAS gene. We then examined whether NF-IL6 activity changes upon influenza virus infection using a gel shift assay (Fig. 5, A and B). NF-IL6 activity significantly increased soon after virus infection, reaching a maximal stimulation of about 3-fold at 2 h postinfection. It then rapidly descended to below the control level. This profile coincided with the change in the FAS promoter activity that occurs upon influenza virus infection (see Fig. 3A). On the other hand, poly(I)•poly(C), which also augments the accumulation of the Fas mRNA in HeLa cells(18Takizawa T. Fukuda R. Miyawaki T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), somewhat differently affected NF-IL6. An increase of NF-IL6 activity was first detectable at 2 h, and maximal 3-fold stimulation occurred 6 h after the RNA was added. In contrast to the experiment with virus infection, NF-IL6 activity did not decrease and maintained this level even after 10 h. This profile again paralleled the change in the Fas mRNA in HeLa cells exposed to poly(I)•poly(C) (18Takizawa T. Fukuda R. Miyawaki T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). NF-IL6 activity did not change when HeLa cells were simply cultured with no added reagents. The activity of nuclear factor I was examined in the nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa cells exposed to poly(I)•poly(C), but no significant change was found (data not shown). This indicates that poly(I)•poly(C) does not affect the activity of DNA-binding nuclear factors in general. The increased binding activity in the extracts of the cells exposed to either influenza virus or poly(I)•poly(C), was sensitive specifically to an anti-NF-IL6 antibody (Fig. 5C), suggesting that only the activity of NF-IL6 increased. These results indicate that the DNA-binding activity of NF-IL6 is augmented by either influenza virus infection or by poly(I)•poly(C). Changes in the NF-IL6 concentrations in HeLa nuclear extracts caused by either influenza virus infection or poly(I)•poly(C) were analyzed by immunoblotting. The antibody detected discrete doublet proteins with apparent molecular masses of 46 and 44 kDa (Fig. 6A), in line with the data of Nishio et al.(39Nishio Y. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1854-1862Google Scholar). Both signals significantly decreased when the antibody was first incubated with an excess of the antigen peptide, whereas a peptide with an unrelated sequence caused little effect (Fig. 6A). This indicates that the antibody specifically detected NF-IL6 in HeLa cells. Three peptides, of which calculated molecular masses are 36, 34, and 16 kDa, are presumably translated from a single mRNA of human NF-IL6 (33Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Google Scholar) and are thought to be the human homolog of the rat proteins: liver-enriched activator protein*, liver-enriched activator protein, and liver-enriched inhibitory protein(40Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Google Scholar), respectively(41Tesmer V.M. Rajadhyaksha A. Babin J. Bina M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7298-7302Google Scholar). Judging from the molecular masses of the two proteins detected by immunoblotting, they are likely to be the products from the first two AUG codons(33Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Google Scholar). A discrepancy in the molecular masses of these proteins is probably due to abundant Pro residues(33Akira S. Isshiki H. Sugita T. Tanabe O. Kinoshita S. Nishio Y. Nakajima T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1897-1906Google Scholar), which could cause improper migration of the peptides on an SDS gel. The intensity of the two signals did not significantly change at any time after exposure to either reagent (Fig. 6B). This suggests that the DNA-binding activity of NF-IL6 is stimulated in those cells by posttranslational modification with no change in the concentration of the transcription factor. Such modification seemed to be rapidly reversed in cells infected with influenza virus but not in those exposed to poly(I)•poly(C), since NF-IL6 activity in virus-infected cells sharply peaked at 2 h postinfection (see Fig. 5). We previously found that infection with influenza virus(12Takizawa T. Matsukawa S. Higuchi Y. Nakamura S. Nakanishi Y. Fukuda R. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2347-2355Google Scholar, 18Takizawa T. Fukuda R. Miyawaki T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) or HIV2 augmented the expression of the Fas-encoding gene in host cells before the onset of apoptosis. The expression of the FAS gene is also enhanced by murine leukemia virus in lymphocytes(42Hiromatsu K. Aoki Y. Makino M. Matsumoto Y. Mizuochi T. Gotoh Y. Nomoto K. Ogasawara J. Nagata S. Yoshikai Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2446-2451Google Scholar), by ischemia in the brain(43Matsuyama T. Hata R. Tagaya M. Yamamoto Y. Nakajima T. Furuyama J.-I. Wanaka A. Sugita M. Brain Res. 1994; 657: 342-346Google Scholar), by hypoxia in cultured cardiomyocytes(44Tanaka M. Itoh H. Adachi S. Akimoto H. Nishikawa T. Kasajima T. Marumo F. Hiroe M. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 426-433Google Scholar), by interferons in various cultured cell lines(18Takizawa T. Fukuda R. Miyawaki T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar, 20Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Google Scholar, 45Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Itoh N. Yonehara S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1274-1279Google Scholar), and by activation with various reagents in human peripheral lymphocytes(46Miyawaki T. Uehara T. Nibu R. Tsuji T. Yachie A. Yonehara S. Taniguchi N. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3753-3758Google Scholar, 47Owen-Schaub L.B. Yonehara S. Crump III, W.L. Grimm E.A. Cell Immunol. 1992; 140: 197-205Google Scholar, 48Drappa J. Brot N. Elkon K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10340-10344Google Scholar). It is thus probable that apoptotic cell death is regulated, at least in part, through changes in the amounts of Fas. Structural analysis of the 5′-end region of the human FAS gene revealed that the gene possesses a TATA-less promoter and that its 5′-upstream region contains putative binding sequences for a limited number of transcription factors. In this study, we focused upon one of these factors, termed NF-IL6, of which eight recognizable sequences are dispersed in a 1.7-kilobase pair DNA at the 5′-end region of the FAS gene. We obtained evidence that NF-IL6 is a positive transcription factor for the human FAS gene. The production of a large amount of Fas mRNA in the cell line KT-3(20Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Google Scholar), which is interleukin-6 dependent(27Shimizu S. Takiguchi T. Sugai S. Matsuoka M. Konda S. Blood. 1988; 71: 196-203Google Scholar), can also be attributed to the function of NF-IL6, since NF-IL6 participates in signal transduction in response to interleukin-6(49Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Google Scholar). We found that the DNA-binding activity of NF-IL6 increases without a change in its molecular number upon infection with influenza virus or exposure to poly(I)•poly(C). All circumstantial evidence supports the notion that the increased activity of NF-IL6 is responsible for the stimulation of FAS gene transcription in virus-infected cells. NF-IL6 is considered to be post-translationally modified upon virus infection. Phosphorylation is the most likely candidate for such modification, since a protein kinase inhibitor shuts down an increase of the Fas mRNA in poly(I)•poly(C)-treated HeLa cells(18Takizawa T. Fukuda R. Miyawaki T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Moreover, other investigators have reported that NF-IL6 is activated through phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase(50Wegner M. Cao Z. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1992; 256: 370-373Google Scholar), by mitogen-activated kinase(51Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Google Scholar), by protein kinase C(52Trautwein C. Caelles C. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Karin M. Chojkier M. Nature. 1993; 364: 544-547Google Scholar, 53Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Google Scholar), and by protein kinase A(53Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Google Scholar). These enzymes phosphorylate Ser and/or Thr residues at various positions within NF-IL6. Another protein kinase, termed double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase(54Hovanessian A.G. J. Interferon Res. 1989; 9: 641-647Google Scholar), could be involved in NF-IL6 phosphorylation upon influenza virus infection because it is activated in virus-infected cells. This kinase has to be autophosphorylated to become functional, which only occurs in the presence of double-stranded RNA(55Galabru J. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 685-694Google Scholar). There is no doubt that double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase is active in poly(I)•poly(C)-treated HeLa cells, where the DNA-binding activity of NF-IL6 increased. Moreover, our preliminary experiments indicated that an increase of Fas protein upon influenza virus infection was abolished in the presence of a DNA that expresses a dominant negative form of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase.3 3T. Takizawa, unpublished observations. We thus suggest that autophosphorylated double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase phosphorylates NF-IL6 and that activated NF-IL6 stimulates FAS gene transcription in influenza virus-infected or poly(I)•poly(C)-treated cells. The activation of NF-IL6 occurred only transiently upon virus infection. This might be due to an inhibitor of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase that is induced in influenza virus-infected cells(56Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6208-6212Google Scholar). Lee and Esteban (57Lee S.B. Esteban M. Virology. 1994; 199: 491-496Google Scholar) have reported that the ectopic expression of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase using the vaccinia virus vector brought about the apoptosis of HeLa cells. Although they maintain that HeLa cells undergo apoptotic death because of an increase in the protein kinase, we speculate that vaccinia virus is also involved. We showed that poly(I)•poly(C), which probably leads to the activation of double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase, did not cause apoptosis of HeLa cells despite an increase in the amount of Fas (18Takizawa T. Fukuda R. Miyawaki T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Fas must be bound by a specific signaling molecule, called Fas-ligand (22Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Google Scholar, 23Suda T. Nagata S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 873-879Google Scholar), to transmit an apoptosis signal. Fas-ligand should thus participate in influenza virus-induced apoptosis. It is unlikely that HeLa cells constitutively produce Fas-ligand, since poly(I)•poly(C)-treated cells do not undergo apoptosis despite the presence of a sufficient amount of Fas(18Takizawa T. Fukuda R. Miyawaki T. Ohashi K. Nakanishi Y. Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). We speculate that the synthesis of Fas-ligand as well as of its receptor, Fas, increases in virus-infected cells prior to cell death. We are currently assessing this issue. We thank Yukito Masamune for discussion and encouragement throughout the study. We also thank Shizuo Akira for pEF-NFIL6 and suggestions, Masaaki Tsuda for suggestions, and Shigekazu Nagata for pEF-BOS."

Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 235-257Google Scholar). AQP1 (AQP-CHIP) is the first recognized aquaporin purified from red cells and renal proximal tubules and is widely expressed throughout the body(3Agre P. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Jung J.S. Raina S. Moon C. Guggino W.B. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F463-F476Google Scholar). Two other clones, AQP2 (4Fushimi K. Uchida S. Hara Y. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Sasaki S.

AQP2 (AQP-CD) is selectively expressed in kidney, and inside kidney it is localized only at the apical membrane of collecting duct cell. AQP3 is expressed in several tissues including kidney, colon, small intestine, lung, liver, pancreas, spleen, and prostate. Localization of AQP3 in the kidney is also restricted to collecting duct cells, but in contrast to AQP2, it distributes on the basolateral membrane. AQP3 also facilitates the transport of nonionic small solutes such as urea and glycerol, while the previously cloned aquaporins are permeable only to water. AQP4 is a mercury-insensitive water channel, which is most abundantly expressed in brain(6Hasegawa H. Ma T. Skach W. Matthay M.A. Verkman A.S. J. Biol.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation of aquaporins, the isolation of aquaporin gene is needed. Previously, human AQP1 gene (9Moon C. Preston G.M. Griffin C.A. Jabs E.W. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15772-15778Google Scholar) and human AQP2 gene (10Uchida S. Sasaki S. Fushumi K. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23451-23455Google Scholar) were isolated, and their structural organization was characterized. Human genes of AQP1 and AQP2 consist of four exons like human MIP26 gene(11Pisano M.M. Chepelinsky A.B. Genomics. 1991; 11: 981-990Google Scholar), and the sites of exon-intron boundary in these three genes exist at the identical points. However, no information about the structural organization of AQP3 gene is available. The structure of AQP3 is interesting in the viewpoint of evolution of the aquaporin family, since AQP3 is most homologous to Escherichia coli glycerol facilitator (GlpF, 42%) and its homology to other AQPs is low (less than 35%)(5Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Google Scholar). In the present study, we isolate human AQP3 gene and characterize its entire structural organization. We also describe the 5′-flanking region of human AQP3 gene and evaluate its promoter activity. To isolate human AQP3 gene, about 6 × 105 phage clones from the human placental genomic library (Stratagene) were screened with human AQP3 cDNA (1.4 kb) labeled with [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.) by random priming(12Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Saito F. Ikeuchi T. Marumo F. Genomics. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Positive clones were purified and characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping and Southern blot analysis. DNA fragments from positive clones were subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene) and sequenced using a fluorescence DNA sequencer (373A, Applied Biosystems). Ten μg of human genomic DNA extracted from leukocytes were digested with restriction endonuclease (XbaI, BamHI, BglII, and SacI), electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. After prehybridization for 4 h, the membrane was hybridized with human AQP3 cDNA (1.4 kb) labeled with [32P]dCTP in 50% formamide, 5 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 5 × Denhardt's, 1.6% SDS, and 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 18 h at 42°C. The membrane was washed in 0.1 × SSC and 0.5% SDS for 60 min at 68°C and was exposed to a film for 3 days at −70°C. A synthetic oligonucleotide primer corresponding to nucleotide +10 to −30 in the human AQP3 cDNA was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). Human lung epithelial (A549) cells (JCRB, Japan), which demonstrated mRNA expression of AQP3 in our preliminary study, were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RNA extracted from A549 cells was hybridized with the end-labeled primer (5 × 104 cpm) in 250 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), and 1 mM EDTA at 55°C for 1 h. Primer extension was carried out with 100 units/ml Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II, Life Technologies, Inc.) in 75 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.25 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.25 mM dNTP, and 100 μg/ml actinomycin D. The synthesized product was electrophoresed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried under vacuum at 80°C for 40 min and was exposed to a film for several days at −70°C. To prepare RNA probe for ribonuclease protection assay, SalI-SalI DNA fragment (340 bp) containing the 5′-flanking region of human AQP3 gene was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(+). This clone (designated Sal#2) was digested with HindIII to make a linearized template for antisense RNA probe. Labeled RNA probe was synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) with [32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp.). RNA extracted from A549 cells was hybridized with the labeled RNA probe in 80% formamide, 40 mM PIPES (pH 6.4), 400 mM sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA at 42°C for 18 h and treated with 0.5 unit/ml RNase A and 10 units/ml T1 at 37°C for 30 min. After treatment, the protected fragments were precipitated and electrophoresed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried under vacuum at 80°C for 40 min and was exposed to a film for several days at −70°C. To measure promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region by luciferase assay, a reporting vector for transcription was constructed. From the Sal#2 clone, the SacI-XhoI DNA fragment (420 bp) containing the 5′-flanking region was subcloned into pGL2-Basic vector (Promega). The constructed vector (pGL2-5′) and pGL2-Basic were purified before transfection into A549 cells. A549 cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin on 15-cm dishes. About 5 × 107 cells growing in exponential phase were harvested by 0.25% trypsin and resuspended in K-PBS buffer (30.8 mM NaCl, 120.7 mM KCl, 1.46 mM KH2PO4, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 10 mM MgCl2). Transfection was performed by electroporation under 400 V at 960 microfarads in a 0.4-mm width cuvette. To evaluate the efficiency of transfection, pSV-β-galactosidase vector (pSVβGal) was transfected together with pGL2-5′ or pGL2-Basic. Transfected cells were seeded on 9-cm dishes in the full medium for 48 h. To examine the effect of phorbol ester and cAMP on the promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region, tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) and chlorophenylthio-cAMP (cpt-cAMP) were added to the medium 24 h after transfection. After washing with calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline twice, the cells were incubated in 900 μl of cell lysis buffer (Promega) at room temperature for 15 min. The cell lysate was kept at −70°C for luciferase assay or β-galactosidase assay. After 20 μl of the cell lysate was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) briefly at room temperature, the light intensity of the sample was immediately counted in a scintillation counter for 1 min. Luciferase concentration was estimated by calculating the square root of measured counts/min minus background counts/min. To measure background counts/min, we prepared the cell lysate of non-transfected cells. After 15 μl of the cell lysate was mixed with 15 μl of β-galactosidase assay buffer (Promega), the sample was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and mixed with 50 μl of 1 M sodium carbonate. The absorbance of the sample was measured at 420 nm. By screening the human placental genomic library with human AQP3 cDNA, we isolated two clones. The digestion of one genomic clone (designated #42) with SalI and BglII released three fragments (0.3, 5.5, and 1.2 kb). These fragments were subcloned and sequenced, which demonstrated the structural organization of human AQP3 gene. Human AQP3 gene consists of six exons and five introns (Fig. 1). The sizes of exons are 171, 127, 138, 119, 218, and 1035 bp, and those of introns are approximately 3530, 300, 350, 330, and 90 bp, respectively. All splice sites conform to the GT-AG rule (Table 1). The sixth exon has a stop codon and a polyadenylation signal. To determine whether human AQP3 gene exists as a single copy or multiple copies, we performed genomic Southern blot analysis. On this blot only one or two distinct hybridization signals were detected (Fig. 2), which suggests that a single AQP3 gene locus exists. Moreover, the pattern of hybridization on this blot was consistent with the known restriction site in the #42 genomic clone (Fig. 1). The 5′ end-SalI fragment in #42 genomic clone was subcloned and sequenced (Fig. 3). The TATAAA sequence (TATA box) is present at −95. No CCAAT sequence is observed. Two Sp1 sequences (KRGGCKRRK) are found at −180 and −186. The initiation site of transcription was determined by primer extension analysis and ribonuclease protection assay with RNA from human A549 cells. In primer extension analysis, major bands were present at −64 (site of T, Fig. 4). Moreover, a protected band was also found at −64 in the ribonuclease protection assay (Fig. 5). These findings indicate that the initiation site of transcription is at −64, which is 31 bases downstream of TATA box. A search for consensus sequences (13Fiasst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Google Scholar) revealed three AP2 sites (CCCMNSSS) at −37, −198, and −293, one possible ATF (CRE) site (TGACGT) at −299, and one SIF site (CCCGTC) at −264. To verify whether the 5′-flanking region of human AQP3 gene (Fig. 3) has promoter activity, we measured luciferase activity of transfected A549 cells. Luciferase activity was corrected by β-galactosidase activity in each experiment. As shown in Fig. 6, pGL2-5′ showed about 5 times greater luciferase activity than pGL2-Basic, which indicates that the 5′-flanking region has a promoter activity. In addition, we also examined the effect of TPA and cpt-cAMP on promoter activity of the 5′-flanking region. TPA (10-7M) up-regulated luciferase activity about 4-fold in pGL2-5′, whereas cpt-cAMP (200 μM) had no effect (Fig. 6). In the present study, we have isolated human AQP3 gene, which exists as a single copy in human genome, and characterized the entire structural organization. We have also demonstrated that the 5′-flanking region of human AQP3 gene has a promoter activity, which is up-regulated by phorbol ester. Previously five cDNA clones of AQP (AQP1-AQP5) have been identified, and only two genomic clones of AQP (AQP1 and AQP2) have been characterized. Human AQP1 gene and human AQP2 gene consist of four exons like human MIP26 gene with the identical points of exon-intron boundary(10Uchida S. Sasaki S. Fushumi K. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23451-23455Google Scholar). On the other hand, human AQP3 gene consists of six exons, and its points of exon-intron boundary are different from other AQP genes. The phylogenetic comparison analysis between AQP3 and other MIP family proteins reveals the separate clustering of AQP3 and GlpF from other aquaporins, which suggests that AQP3 is most related to GlpF and developed in a different branch from other aquaporins(5Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Fushimi K. Uchida S. Kuwahara M. Saito H. Furukawa T. Nakajima K. Yamaguchi Y. Gojobori T. Marumo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6269-6273Google Scholar). The different structural organization of AQP3 from AQP1 and AQP2 is consistent with the above suggestions. Although AQP3 is expressed in several tissues including kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and lung, AQP3 is expressed exclusively in principal cells of the collecting duct in the kidney like AQP2. To elucidate the mechanism of cell-specific expression, analysis of the promoter region of AQP3 is necessary. The 5′-flanking region demonstrated in this study has a typical TATA box, the initiation site of transcription at 31 bp downstream of the TATA box, and several consensus sequences, which indicates that this region contains the promoter sequence of AQP3. Moreover, the 5′-flanking region was shown to have a promoter activity demonstrated by luciferase assay. Further examination of the 5′-flanking region of these two genes (AQP2 and AQP3) will reveal a clue to solve the mechanism of collecting duct-specific gene expression. In human AQP2 gene, the promoter region has a ATF (CRE) site, an AP1 site, and an AP2 site, and its promoter activity is up-regulated by cAMP but not TPA.2 2Y. Matsumura, S. Uchida, M. Furuno, Y. Takeuchi, F. Marumo, and S. Sasaki, unpublished observation. In human AQP3 gene, the promoter region has a possible ATF site (the last eighth base (C) is different from G/A) and three AP2 sites, and its promoter activity is up-regulated by TPA but not cAMP. These findings suggest that the transcriptional regulation of AQP3 is different from that of AQP2. In the rat experimental models, expression of AQP2 is highly up-regulated by dehydration for several days(14Hayashi M. Sasaki S. Tsuganezawa H. Monkawa T. Kitajima W. Konishi K. Fushumi K. Marumo F. Saruta T. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1778-1783Google Scholar). This up-regulation may be mediated by an increased level of systemic vasopressin in dehydrated state. Vasopressin, acting on vasopressin V2 receptor, increases the intracellular cAMP concentration, which in turn stimulates the transcription of AQP2 gene. AQP3 is also up-regulated by dehydration, although its extent of up-regulation is less than that of AQP2.3 3Y. Takeuchi and S. Sasaki, unpublished observation. It is possible that this up-regulation of AQP3 is similarly mediated by vasopressin, since principal cells of the collecting duct have vasopressin V1 receptors beside V2 receptors, and V1 receptor is known to be coupled to the Ca2+/protein kinase C system. Activation of the Ca2+/protein kinase C system will stimulate the transcription of AQP3 as demonstrated in this study (Fig. 6). The possibility that two aquaporins located in the same cells use different signaling systems is noteworthy, and further studies are needed to evaluate this speculation. Up-regulation of these two aquaporins, namely AQP2 located at the apical membrane and AQP3 at the basolateral membrane, would be helpful for increased water reabsorption in the collecting duct in a dehydrated state. We thank Drs. N. Tojo, M. Furuno, and Y. Matsumura for their assistance and helpful discussion."

Sarcosine oxidase is produced as an inducible enzyme when Corynebacterium sp. P-1 is grown with sarcosine as source of carbon and energy(1Kvalnes-Krick K. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6061-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the presence of oxygen and tetrahydrofolate (H4folate), 1The abbreviations used are: H4folatetetrahydrofolateMALDImatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization5,10-CH2-H4folate5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate10-CHO-H4folate10-formyltetrahydrofolateTEMEDN,N,Nʹ,Nʹ-tetramethylethylenediamine. the enzyme catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine (N-methylglycine) to yield glycine, hydrogen peroxide, and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-H4folate). In the absence of H4folate, the same rate of sarcosine oxidation is observed and the oxidized methyl group is released as formaldehyde(2Kvalnes-Krick K. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7391-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition to sarcosine, the enzyme can also oxidize cyclic amino acids, like L-proline and L-pipecolic acid, but at slower rates(3Zeller H.-D. Hille R. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5145-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). tetrahydrofolate matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate 10-formyltetrahydrofolate N,N,Nʹ,Nʹ-tetramethylethylenediamine. Corynebacterial sarcosine oxidase contains four different subunits (α, 100 kDa; β, 42 kDa; γ, 20 kDa; δ, 6 kDa), 1 mol of noncovalently bound FAD and 1 mol of FAD covalently attached to a histidyl residue in the β subunit(1Kvalnes-Krick K. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6061-6069Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The noncovalent flavin accepts electrons from sarcosine which are then transferred in one-electron steps to the covalent flavin where oxygen is reduced to hydrogen peroxide(3Zeller H.-D. Hille R. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5145-5154Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Ali S.N. Zeller H.-D. Calisto M.K. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10980-10986Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The presence of covalent and noncovalent flavin is a feature unique to the heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidases but other physiologically important mammalian enzymes, like nitric oxide synthase and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, contain two different flavins that bind noncovalently at the active site(5Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2171) Google Scholar). Bacterial sarcosine oxidases have been isolated from over a dozen different organisms and fall into two major classes: heterotetramers (α, 96-100 kDa; β, 42-45 kDa; γ, 20-23 kDa; δ, 6-14 kDa) contain covalent (β subunit attachment) and noncovalent flavin, like the corynebacterial enzyme; monomeric enzymes (42-45 kDa) contain only covalent flavin and are similar in size to the β subunit in the heterotetrameric enzymes(6Kvalnes-Krick K. Jorns M.S. Muller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. Vol. 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton1991: 425-435Google Scholar). It is not known whether H4folate can act as a substrate for the monomeric enzymes. In mammalian liver, oxidative cleavage of the methyl group from sarcosine is catalyzed by sarcosine dehydrogenase (94 kDa), an enzyme that exhibits many similarities with dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (96 kDa). These monomeric enzymes contain a single covalently bound flavin and use H4folate as a co-substrate, similar to that observed for corynebacterial sarcosine oxidase(7Cook R.J. Misono K.S. Wagner C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12998-13002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Steenkamp D.J. Husain M. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Porter D.H. Cook R.J. Wagner C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 243: 396-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Proline oxidizing enzymes are not known to contain covalently bound flavin(10Despicer P.O.

Biochem. 1980; 49: 1005-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). However, pipecolic acid oxidase (46 kDa) from mammalian liver, an enzyme similar in size to the monomeric sarcosine oxidases and the β subunit from the tetrameric sarcosine oxidases, does contain a single covalently bound flavin(12Mihalik S.J. McGuinness M. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4822-4830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of covalent flavin in sarcosine, dimethylglycine, and pipecolic acid oxidoreductases is noteworthy since this is a fairly uncommon feature, particularly in mammalian flavoproteins. The complex quaternary structure and multiple binding sites for substrates and prosthetic groups in corynebacterial sarcosine oxidase provide a particularly intriguing target for structure-function studies. We recently reported the single-step cloning and overexpression of the genes coding for sarcosine oxidase from Corynebacterium sp. P-1 and the characterization of the recombinant enzyme(13Chlumsky L.J. Zhang L. Ramsey A.J. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11132-11142Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the structure and organization of the sarcosine oxidase operon and nearby gene(s). Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase were purchased from New England Biolabs and Promega and used as described by the manufacturer. Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA Sequencing Kit was purchased from Amersham Corp. α-32P-Labeled dATP and dCTP were purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. Long Ranger Gel Solution was obtained from A. T. Biochem. ProBlott membranes were a gift from Applied Biosystems. Coomassie Blue R-250, TEMED, and ammonium persulfate were purchased from Bio-Rad. The subunits from 100 pmol of purified sarcosine oxidase from Corynebacterium sp. P-1 were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 3-24% acrylamide gradient(13Chlumsky L.J. Zhang L. Ramsey A.J. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11132-11142Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The separated subunits were transferred to ProBlott membranes and stained using Coomassie Blue R-250 as described by the manufacturer. The cysteine residues were not protected prior to analysis. The amino termini of the subunits were sequenced by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer equipped with an Applied Biosystems 120A Analyzer at the laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The entire corynebacterial insert in pLJC305 was sequenced using a combination of the original plasmid, deletions, and subcloned fragments. Synthetic primers (Ransom Hill Bioscience, Inc.) were used to fill in gaps in the sequence. All the constructs were prepared in pBluescript II phagmid vectors. Single-stranded template was prepared from phagmids in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue using the helper phage VCSM13 as described by Stratagene. Sequence data were obtained using α-32P-labeled dATP or dCTP with Sequenase 2.0. Both strands were sequenced using both dGTP and dITP chemicals as described by the manufacturer to combat problems inherent in sequencing high G-C content DNA. Sequences were assembled, edited, and analyzed using the Genetics Computer Group software package (14Devereux R. Haeberli P. Smithies O.

Dot matrix comparisons were conducted using the DOTBLOT program (window size = 30, stringency setting = 16, unless otherwise noted)(17Maizel J.V. Lenk R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 375-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment results obtained using the MACAW program (20Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Protein-Struct. Funct.

Sarcosine oxidase (6.83 mg) was mixed with guanidine hydrochloride to a final concentration of 2 M at pH 7.5. Except as noted, the subunits were isolated by chromatography (200 μl/run) on a Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration column (Pharmacia) pre-equilibrated with 3 M guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and run at 0.5 ml/min for 60 min. The isolated subunits were pooled, concentrated using Centricon-3 microconcentrators (Amicon), and rechromatographed until the individual subunits were pure. After the first gel filtration step, the isolated α and β subunits were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in column buffer containing 50 mM dithiothreitol; the column buffer used for rechromatography of these subunits contained 10 mM dithiothreitol. The volume of the isolated subunits was adjusted to 1.5 ml in 5% acetic acid (γ and δ) or 5% acetic acid containing 10 mM dithiothreitol (α and β). The samples were centrifuged at 33,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C, and the supernatant removed to a fresh tube. The pellet was resuspended in an additional 1.5 ml of solvent and centrifuged as above. This procedure was repeated until the entire pellet went into solution. The pooled samples were concentrated to a final volume of approximately 100 μl and submitted for analysis. Mass spectrometry (electrospray and MALDI) was kindly performed by Nolle Potier at the Laboratoire de Spectrometrie de Masse Bioorganique, Faculte de Chimie, Universite Louis Pasteur, Strasbourg, France. We have sequenced the 7285-base pair corynebacterial DNA insert in pLJC305, a pBluescript II SK(+) construct previously shown to express high levels of sarcosine oxidase using E. coli XL1-Blue as the host organism(13Chlumsky L.J. Zhang L. Ramsey A.J. Jorns M.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11132-11142Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of seven open reading frames are shown in Fig. 1. Gene arrangement, intergenic regions, and a restriction map are shown in Fig. 2. This section provides an overview. Details of gene identification and sequence analysis are described later.Figure 1:Nucleotide sequence of a 7285 base pair Corynebacterium sp. P-1 DNA fragment containing sarcosine oxidase and other nearby gene(s) and the deduced amino acid sequence of the gene products.

Single underlining indicates regions where the deduced amino acid sequence of the sarcosine oxidase subunits matched NH2-terminal peptide sequencing data; gaps mainly reflect incomplete peptide sequence data, as detailed in the text.

The next four open reading frames (soxA, soxB, soxG, and soxD) code for the subunits of sarcosine oxidase (α, β, γ, and δ, respectively) with the genes arranged in the order, soxBDAG. The serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene (glyA) terminates 2 bases before the start of soxB. The soxB and soxD genes are separated by 11 bases. The stop codon of soxD overlaps with the start codon of soxA. The start codon of soxG is found 8 bases before the end of soxA. The presence of overlapping genes or genes separated by a short intergenic region has been associated with translational coupling. In this phenomenon, the same ribosome or, at least, a component thereof, serves to translate two contiguous genes without ever dissociating from the mRNA(21Normark S. Bergstrom S. Edlund T. Grundstrom T. Jaurin B. Lindberg F.P. Olof O. Ann. Rev. Genet. 1983; 17: 499-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Potential ribosome-binding sites are identifiable 6 to 8 bases before the start of each of the four sox genes (Fig. 2). These sites are positioned such that translation of an upstream gene will terminate within the ribosome-binding site of the corresponding downstream gene, a feature required for the coupling effect. In contrast to the close packing observed for the first five genes, the next open reading frame is found 340 nucleotides downstream from soxG and codes for a putative purU gene. This gene is important in the regulation of one-carbon folate metabolism in E. coli and is also involved in purine biosynthesis (22Nagy P.L. McCorkle G.M. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7066-7073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bosl M. Kersten H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 221-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nagy P.L. Marolewski A. Benkovic S.J. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A seventh open reading frame is found 73 bases from the end of the purU gene. This open reading frame could potentially code for a 65-residue peptide fragment, but a BLAST search failed to identify any homology with known proteins. Potential ribosome-binding sites are found 6 bases upstream from the start of the purU gene and the unidentified, seventh open reading frame. The overall G-C content of the six genes identified in this study was 68%. Table 1 compares the codon preference of these genes with 24 genes from other Corynebacterium sp. found in the data base, including two genes with a high G-C content (70-71%) and 22 genes with a moderate G-C content (41-59%). As expected, codons containing a G or C in the third position are used preferentially in the Corynebacterium sp. P-1 genes and in the two G-C-rich genes from other corynebacteria. An exception is provided by the codon usage observed for glutamic acid in the Corynebacterium sp. P-1 genes which is evenly distributed between GAG (55%) and GAA (45%), similar to other corynebacterial genes with a moderate G-C content rather than the G-C-rich genes. With the inclusion of our data, the codon usage data base for G-C-rich corynebacterial sequences will increase about 4-fold and may facilitate the design of oligonucleotide probes for use in these organisms.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A BLAST search revealed strong homology between the open reading frame at the 5ʹ end of the corynebacterial DNA insert in pLJC305 and the COOH-terminal region of various serine hydroxymethyltransferases. A multiple sequence alignment of the corynebacterial sequence with 21 known serine hydroxymethyltransferases was generated using the program PILEUP. The results, presented as a dendrogram in Fig. 3A, show a clear division into two major clusters corresponding to prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences. The putative corynebacterial sequence falls within the prokaryotic cluster and exhibits highest homology with serine hydroxymethyltransferase from Hypomicrobium methylovorum, as judged by BLAST analysis and pairwise comparisons using the program GAP. The corynebacterial sequence aligns with a COOH-terminal region containing about 65% of the hypomicrobial serine hydroxymethyltransferase, exhibiting 57% identity and 72% similarity. Further, a lysine residue is found in the corynebacterial sequence at a position corresponding to a highly conserved lysine which serves as the covalent attachment site for pyridoxal phosphate in serine hydroxymethyltransferase (Fig. 3B). soxG encodes a polypeptide of 203 residues. The sequence determined for the first 11 amino acids of the γ subunit by peptide sequence analysis coincides with residues 2-12 in the amino acid sequence deduced from the soxG gene sequence, indicating post-translational loss of the initial methionine (Fig. 1). The molecular weight of the γ subunit estimated from the gene sequence and corrected for loss of one methionine (20,898) is in excellent agreement with a value determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (20,899) and is consistent with values previously estimated by SDS-gel electrophoreses (Table 2).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab soxD codes for a polypeptide containing 98 residues. Peptide sequence analysis of the δ subunit resulted in the identification of 18 out of the first 22 amino acids. The peptide data agree with the sequence deduced from the gene sequence, except for a mismatch in the third amino acid (Fig. 1). The peptide data indicate that the initial methionine is not lost from the δ subunit, in contrast to results obtained for all the other subunits. The molecular weight estimated from the gene sequence (11,314) matches the value obtained by electrospray mass spectrometry (11,313) whereas somewhat lower values have been estimated by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Table 2). A BLAST search detected no homology of the γ or δ subunit with any other protein in the data base. These subunits do not contain any known motifs. soxB encodes a protein with 405 residues. Peptide sequence analysis identified 34 out of the first 35 amino acids in the β subunit. The peptide data are in complete agreement with the sequence deduced from the soxB gene sequence and indicate that the initial methionine is absent in the mature protein (Fig. 1). As expected, the molecular weight of the β subunit estimated from the gene sequence (43,854) is somewhat lower than the value determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (44,314). The best match with the electrospray value is obtained when the estimated molecular weight of β includes a contribution due to covalently bound FMN (44,308). The stability of the pyrophosphate link in FAD under the analysis conditions is not known. Similar molecular weight values have been obtained by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Table 2). The β subunit exhibits an ADP-binding motif near the NH2 terminus which satisfies all of the 11 consensus sequence requirements described by Wierenga et al.(25Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), except for an aspartate at position 1. A BLAST search revealed sequence homology of the β subunit with the following proteins: peptide fragment data obtained for the β subunit from a similar heterotetrameric sarcosine oxidase from Corynebacterium sp.

Fig. 4 shows an alignment of the NH2-terminal region of all seven sequences. An aspartate is found in position 1 in all of the sequences except for dimethylglycine dehydrogenase which has a glutamate in this position. An aspartate has been observed in position 1 in several well-documented FAD-binding sites(34Mckie J.H. Douglas K.T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12921-12931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the six known proteins, BLAST analysis also detected homology of the β subunit with a putative 95-residue peptide fragment encoded by an unidentified open reading frame found near the cycH gene in Paracoccus denitrificans. The peptide exhibits 70% identity and 84% similarity with the β subunit and contains an ADP-binding motif near its NH2 terminus (Fig. 4). The β subunit exhibits greater than 80% identity with peptide fragment data encompassing about 43% of the β subunit from the Corynebacterium sp. U-96 enzyme. These fragments are readily aligned with the amino acid sequence deduced from the soxB gene sequence. His175 is tentatively identified as the covalent flavin attachment site in the β subunit, based on an alignment with a covalent flavin-containing peptide from the Corynebacterium sp. U-96 enzyme (Fig. 5). In dimethylglycine dehydrogenase, the covalent flavin is attached to His84, a position much closer to the ADP-binding motif. The covalent flavin attachment site in the monomeric sarcosine oxidases is not known. The putative covalent flavin attachment site in the β subunit aligns with a conserved asparagine in the monomeric sarcosine oxidases (Fig. 5). On the other hand, the dimethylglycine dehydrogenase attachment site aligns with a histidine residue that is conserved in all of the monomeric sarcosine oxidases but not in the β subunit where an alanine (Ala63) is found at this position (Fig. 4). Pairwise alignments using the GAP program indicate about 22-25% identity and 45-47% similarity between the β subunit and the monomeric sarcosine oxidases. The degree of homology among the monomeric sarcosine oxidases themselves shows greater variability (37-86% identity, 58-91% similarity). A multiple sequence alignment of the β subunit with the monomeric sarcosine oxidases reveals that 42 residues are conserved among the five polypeptides. The most highly conserved regions include the NH2-terminal dinucleotide binding motif and an ~60-amino acid region near the COOH terminus (Thr332 to Arg388 in the β subunit) (data not shown). The level of homology of the β subunit with dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (23% identity, 48% similarity) is similar to that observed for the β subunit and the monomeric sarcosine oxidases but a somewhat lower degree of homology is observed when dimethylglycine dehydrogenase is compared with the monomeric enzymes (18-23% identity, 43-45% similarity). soxA codes for a 967-residue protein. Results obtained for the sequence of the first 29 amino acids in the α subunit by peptide analysis are in complete agreement with the sequence deduced from the soxA gene sequence, except for the loss of the initial methionine (Fig. 1). The molecular weight of the α subunit determined from the gene sequence (102,633) is in good agreement with a value determined by MALDI mass spectrometry (103,160) and consistent with values previously estimated by SDS-gel electrophoresis (Table 2). An ADP-binding motif is found near the NH2 terminus of the α subunit which meets the 11 consensus sequence requirements (25Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), except for an aspartate at position 1 (Fig. 6), a feature also seen with the β subunit and the monomeric sarcosine oxidases. Using the α subunit as the query sequence in a BLAST analysis, two groups of high-scoring sequences were identified which exhibit homology to regions in either the NH2- or the COOH-terminal half of the large α polypeptide. The limits of homologous regions involving three or more proteins were estimated based on the location of statistically significant homology blocks obtained when the sequences were aligned using the program MACAW(20Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Protein-Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). In comparing two proteins, the extent of sequence homology was estimated based on the length of the diagonal observed in a dot matrix comparison at a stringency setting of 16. Except as noted, this stringency setting eliminated most background noise and the extent of the remaining diagonal was readily discerned.

Overstimulation with LPS, a frequent consequence of Gram-negative sepsis, can result in systemic flooding with potent proinflammatory cytokines that include interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). This contributes directly to the development of endotoxic shock, multiple organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and acute respiratory distress syndrome; these are collectively referred to as Gram-negative sepsis syndrome. More than 120,000 cases of Gram-negative sepsis syndrome occur in the United States annually(2Ziegler E.J. et al.N. Engl. J.

Science. 1991; 249: 1431-1433Google Scholar), it appears that LPS toxicity largely depends on the presence of LBP, a hypothesis that has been borne out in in vivo models of LPS toxicity(6Gallay P. Heumann D. LeRoy D. Barras C. Glauser M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9935-9938Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested in better understanding the different structure-function relationships underlying the formation of specificity of LBP for LPS. Here, we report the identification of an LPS binding site of LBP, determined by scanning the entire primary structure of LBP for the presence of small LPS binding domains. Only one domain, corresponding to LBP-(91-108), was found to bind LPS tightly. This region most likely comprises at least part of the LPS binding site of LBP. An Advanced ChemTech model 350 peptide synthesizer was used for the simultaneous synthesis of up to 96 peptides. The double coupling FMOC (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protocol was followed, and synthesis products were worked up according to the manufacturer's specification. Crude nested peptides were screened for LPS blocking activity as described below. Preparative scale peptide syntheses were performed essentially as previously described (7Heavner G.A. Falcone M. Kruszynski M. Epps L. Mervic M. Riexinger D. McEver R.P. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993; 42: 484-489Google Scholar) on 4-methyl-benzhydrylamine resins with an ABI 431A synthesizer using version 1.12 of the standard Boc software. Following HPLC purification, all peptides had the correct amino acid analysis and molecular ion (fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy or plasma desorption mass spectroscopy) and were greater than 95% pure as determined by two different HPLC gradients. Peptide sequences are given in the one letter code, with the following modifications: Ac- denotes N-acetylated derivatives, -NH2 denotes COOH-terminal amidated derivatives, and d- denotes D-isomer substitution of the amino-terminal residue only. The LBP-immunoglobulin fusion protein was comprised of human LBP coding sequences fused to human IgG1 CH1 sequences and secreted from SP2/O murine myeloma cells in association with a human Ck domain from which the Vk region had been deleted. The LBP-Ig was purified to homogeneity by means of protein A chromatography. Acid (0.1 M citrate, pH 3.5)-eluted material was immediately neutralized with a molar excess of pH 7.8 Tris buffer and dialyzed extensively against PBS. Only material with low endotoxin content (<10 enzyme units/ml), as measured by the chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Bio Whittaker), was used in subsequent studies. LBP was released from the LBP-Ig by limited proteolysis with papain, and the immunoglobulin constant regions were removed by passage over a protein A affinity column. The released LBP (LBP60k) appeared as a 60-kDa band that was indistinguishable from native LBP by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This material was subsequently biotinylated using D-biotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester following the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). LPS-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was obtained from Alercheck, Inc. (Portland, ME). According to the manufacturer, it was prepared from Escherichia coli J5 LPS (rough LPS) by direct coupling of labeling grade horseradish peroxidase (Boehringer Mannheim) to periodate-activated LPS. The horseradish peroxidase:LPS coupling ratio was 2.5:1. LBP-Ig was Fc-captured by coating ELISA plates with 10 μg/ml goat anti-human Fc antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in bicarbonate buffer. After washing, purified LBP-Ig was added to the wells at 1 μg/ml in PBS containing 1% nonfat dry milk (PBSM), and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. Following washing, individual competitors and an equal volume of 250 μg/ml LPS-horseradish peroxidase were added to the ELISA wells and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. The plates were washed with PBS, and the chromogenic substrate O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was added and processed as described by the manufacturer (Sigma). In experiments using the preincubation format, the inhibitors are added alone to the assay wells and allowed to incubate prior to washing and addition of LPS-horseradish peroxidase. For ELISA assays measuring the binding of biotinylated LBP to solid phase LPS, ELISA plates were coated with 50 μg/ml E. coli 0111:B4 LPS in bicarbonate buffer essentially as described(8Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10867-10871Google Scholar). After washing with PBSM, different inhibitor dilutions (in PBSM) were incubated alone (preincubation experiments) or with an equal volume of 1 μg/ml (in PBSM) biotinylated LBP (competitive inhibition) and were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. For the preincubation assays, the plates were further washed, and 0.5 μg/ml (8 nM in PBSM) biotinylated LBP (LBP-B) was incubated and washed as before. Bound LBP was detected in both formats with 1/1000 Z-avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Zymed) and processed as described by the manufacturer. Human PBMC were purified from normal donor blood by differential centrifugation using mono-poly resolving medium (Flow-ICN) and following the instructions of the manufacturer. In a 200-μl final volume of Iscove's serum-free medium (JRH Biosciences), 5 × 105 PBMC were combined with different concentrations of E. coli 0111:B4 LPS and inhibitor peptides. LBP potentiated cultures were supplemented with 200 ng/ml (3 nM) purified human LBP (LBP60k, described above). Cultures were incubated for 3 h in a 37°C humidified CO2 incubator; supernatants were collected and assayed for human TNFα content by means of the previously described WEHI bioassay(9Espevik T. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 99-105Google Scholar). Purified human recombinant TNFα (Genzyme) was used as standard. An ELISA-based competitive inhibition assay was used to detect LPS binding peptides by means of their ability to inhibit binding of LPS-horseradish peroxidase to LBP-Ig. Since LBP binds different forms of LPS via the common lipid A moiety N,O-acylated β1,6-D-glucosamine disaccharide 1,4′-bisphosphate(8Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10867-10871Google Scholar), this competitive inhibition ELISA could potentially identify lipid A-specific peptides. Indeed, we found that LBP-Ig can specifically bind LPS-horseradish peroxidase in a way that is inhibitable by different LPS- and LBP-specific blocking molecules:2 2A. H. Taylor, unpublished observations. (i) smooth (E. coli 0111:B4) and rough (E. coli J5) unlabeled LPS and lipid A (Salmonella minnesota R595) could competitively inhibit binding of LPS-horseradish peroxidase to the Fc-captured LBP-Ig, each reaching 50% inhibition in the 10 μM range; (ii) polymyxin B (Roerig), a potent lipid A binder, also could inhibit the LPS-horseradish peroxidase with an IC50 of 0.05 μM; (iii) 8 of 26 different anti-human LBP monoclonal antibodies were found to inhibit the binding of LPS-horseradish peroxidase to LBP-Ig; (iv) a control LBP-Ig fusion protein in which the COOH-terminal-half of the LBP domain had been deleted displayed no LPS binding activity. We synthesized a panel of 146 overlapping 15-mer peptides corresponding to the entire LBP primary structure (10Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Google Scholar) and screened the crude peptides for LPS blocking activity in the competitive inhibition assay. Interestingly, only two of the nested peptides, 31 (WKVRKSFFKLQGSFD-NH2), corresponding to LBP residues 91-105, and 32 (RKSFFKLQGSFDVSV-NH2), corresponding to 94-108, could completely inhibit binding of LPS-horseradish peroxidase by LBP-Ig (Fig. 1A). The two active peptides were selected for further study. Three peptides from the LBP-(91-108) region were synthesized and purified to homogeneity: LBP-(91-105)-NH2 (WKVRKSFFKLQGSFD-NH2), LBP-(94-108)-NH2 (RKSFFKLQGSFDVSV-NH2), and LBP-(91-108)-NH2 (WKVRKSFFKLQGSFDVSV-NH2). All three peptides were freely soluble in distilled water. The peptides were assessed for the ability to block binding of LPS-horseradish peroxidase to Fc-captured LBP-Ig as before and were found to exhibit similar IC50 values, each in the 10-20 μM range (Fig. 1B). A fourth analog was synthesized, LBPAc-(91-105)-NH2 (Ac-WKVRKSFFKLQGSFD-NH2); interestingly, it was found to be totally inactive, at least within the concentration range tested. This relatively inactive analog was used as a negative control in several of the experiments described below. To define further the specificity of the LBP-(91-108)-related peptides for LPS, two types of preincubation experiments were carried out. First, as expected, preincubation of unlabeled LPS with Fc-captured LBP-Ig, followed by washing, inhibited subsequent binding of LPS-horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 2A). However, preincubation of the peptides with Fc-captured LBP-Ig, followed by washing, had no effect on subsequent binding of LPS-horseradish peroxidase; this indicated that the peptides do not interact with LBP-Ig to inhibit LPS binding. Second, binding of biotinylated LBP (LBP-B) to LPS-coated plates could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by preincubation of the plates with various analogs of LBP-(91-108) (Fig. 2B) or by polymyxin B. As before, LBP Ac-(91-105)-NH2 did not block binding of LBP to LPS. These results show that the LBP-(91-108) peptides specifically inhibit the LPS-LBP interaction by binding to LPS. We calculated the LPS binding affinity of the LBP-(91-108) peptides after determining the relative ability of the LBP peptides and polymyxin B to compete with LBP-B for binding to solid phase LPS. The signal obtained from binding 8 nM LBP-B to solid phase LPS was inhibited, by 50%, by simultaneous addition of 1 μM polymyxin B, indicating a 125-fold difference in relative affinity for LPS. Since polymyxin B has a Kd = 8.6 × 10-8M, the relative affinity of LBP-B for LPS = (8.6 × 10-8)/(125) = 6.9 × 10-10M, in good agreement with a previous report(8Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10867-10871Google Scholar). Values for the peptides were calculated using the same method and ranged between 0.1 and 0.04 of the affinity held by polymyxin B (Table 1). Interestingly, the affinities of the LBP peptides were found to be improved by as much as 12-fold by replacing the amino-terminal amino acid residues with D-isomers (Table 1). Thus, the LPS binding affinities of the LBP peptides approach that of polymyxin B, a potent but highly toxic inhibitor(11Yow E. Moyer J. Smith C. Arch. Intern. Med. 1958; 92: 248-257Google Scholar).TABLE I Open table in a new tab Two models were utilized to determine if the LBP-(91-108) peptides could also block complex biological responses to LPS challenges in vitro. The chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate assay (LAL) is sensitive to minute amounts of LPS (as little as 1 pg/ml) and is specific for smooth and rough LPS forms, as well as for lipid A. It can be seen (Table 2) that the same LBP-(91-108) peptides that were found to block binding of LPS by LBP also can neutralize the LAL reaction to lipid A; LBP-(91-105)-NH2 and LBP-(91-108)-NH2 displayed similar lipid A neutralizing potencies as found for polymyxin B (Table 2). These results show that the LBP peptides can completely block the exquisitely sensitive LAL reaction to lipid A and accordingly indicate that the LBP-(91-108)-related peptides are specific for lipid A.TABLE II Open table in a new tab A large degree of LPS toxicity is a consequence of TNFα released by CD14+ monocyte/macrophage lineage cells following exposure to LPS•LBP complexes(12Tracey K.J. Lowry S.F. Adv. Surg. 1990; 23: 21-56Google Scholar, 13Beutler B. Milsark I.W. Cerami A. Science. 1985; 229: 869-871Google Scholar). Accordingly, we wished to determine if the LBP peptides could block the LBP-dependent LPS response of human mononuclear cells in vitro. Fig. 3 shows the LBP-dependent TNFα response of purified human PBMC to different doses of LPS and the blocking ability of a representative LBP peptide. In the absence of human serum, PBMC are completely unresponsive to 1 ng/ml LPS. As previously shown(5Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Wolfson E. Ulevitch R.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 200-206Google Scholar, 10Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Google Scholar), potentiation with added purified LBP restored the ability of the PBMC to release robust amounts of TNFα in response to 1 ng/ml LPS. Addition of only 3 μM LBP-(94-108)-NH2 inhibited this LBP-dependent TNFα response to 1 ng/ml LPS by 50%, and 30 μM LBP-(94-108)-NH2 completely abolished the TNFα response. In fact, 30 μM LBP-(94-108)-NH2 could substantially inhibit the PBMC response to 10 ng/ml LPS, even though much of this response appears to be LBP independent. In separate experiments, similar results were also obtained using a serum-stable analog of LBP-(94-108)-NH2 (viz. LBP-(d-94-108)-NH2) when tested with 1% normal human serum-potentiated PBMC response to 1 ng/ml LPS.2 The results show that 1-10 μM LBP-(94-108) peptides can block both purified LBP- and normal human serum-potentiated LPS responses to physiologically relevant doses of LPS. The LBP-(91-108) peptides were also tested for the ability to block TNFα response to LPS challenge in vivo. When mice were coinjected with 1 ng of LPS/galactosamine and individual LBP-(91-108) peptides, each of the LBP-(91-108) peptides could significantly inhibit the TNFα response (Fig. 4, A-E). All of the peptides could inhibit by at least 50%; two of the peptides, LBP-(d-94-108)-NH2 and LBP-(d-91-108)-NH2, could completely inhibit the TNFα response when administered at about 10 and 40 μg/mouse, respectively. Fig. 4, panel F, shows the relative LPS neutralization potencies of the peptides. A 500-fold range of potencies was evident, with 0.1 μg/mouse of the most potent peptide blocking by 50% the TNFα response to 1 ng of LPS. Because the maximum serum LPS levels generally found among septic patients do not exceed 0.1 ng/ml, the results augur well for the ability of these peptides to inhibit LPS toxicity in vivo (studies in progress). Few examples exist in the literature that describe potent blocking peptides with Kd in the submicromolar range. This is true even when detailed knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of the receptor and its ligand are available. Therefore, it is remarkable that two overlapping 15-mer LPS binding peptides were identified that can completely block the high affinity interaction between LPS and LBP. Our success with this strategy may reflect essential differences in how protein receptors recognize small ligands (such as the β1,6-D-glucosamine disaccharide 1,4′-bisphosphate that most likely represents the moiety of lipid A recognized by LBP), as opposed to the large discontinuous interactive surfaces characteristic of protein-protein interactions. Accordingly, it is possible that the approach described here might be of general use when the interactive portion of the ligand is predicted to be relatively small. The results suggest that in the intact protein, LBP residues 91-108 play a critical role in the formation of specificity to LPS, forming at least part of the LPS binding site. This proposal is supported by several previously reported observations. (i) Recent modeling experiments have attempted to predict the LPS binding site of human LBP based on the three-dimensional crystal structure of the Limulus-anti-LPS factor and certain sequence similarities between Limulus-anti-LPS factor and LBP(14Hoess A. Watson S. Siber G.R. Liddington R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3351-3356Google Scholar). Interestingly, LBP-(91-108) comprises the loop and the second β-strand of the amphipathic loop structure predicted to be the LPS binding site in these modeling experiments. (ii) Rabbit LBP, when cleaved at a unique plasmin hypersensitivity site between residues 99 and 100, loses all LPS binding activity(1Tobias P.S. Mathison J. Mintz D. Lee J.-D. Kravchenko K. Pugin J. Ulevitch R.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1992; 7: 239-245Google Scholar). (iii) The amino-terminal fragment of LBP (residues 1-197) retains the LPS binding activity of the native molecule(15Theofan G. Horwitz A.H. Williams R.E. Liu P.-S. Chan I. Birr C. Carroll S.F. Meszaros K. Parent J.B. Kasler H. Aberle S. Trown P.W. Gazzano-Santoro H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3623-3629Google Scholar). (iv) A 15-mer peptide derived from bactericidal permeability increasing protein (BPI) has been described that neutralizes LPS in the LAL reaction and is bactericidal(16Little R. Kelner D.N. Lim E. Burke D.J. Conlon P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1865-1872Google Scholar), two properties of native BPI(17Marra M.N. Wilde C.G. Griffith J.E. Snable J.L. Scott R.W. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 662-666Google Scholar, 18Weiss J. Muello K. Victor M. Elsbach P. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 3109-3115Google Scholar). LBP and BPI display considerable sequence identity (10Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Google Scholar) and share the ability to bind LPS with high affinity. After sequence alignment (which does not require the introduction of gaps through residues 122)(10Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D. Mathison J.C. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1990; 249: 1429-1431Google Scholar), the bactericidal/LPS neutralizing BPI-related peptide (BPI 85-99) shares partial identity with the active LBP oligomers described here (LBP 91-108). However, unlike BPI(85-99), preliminary experiments indicate that the LBP-(91-108)-related peptides do not inhibit growth of Gram-negative organisms.2 The results described here suggest high resolution site-directed mutagenesis experiments that, together with monoclonal antibody epitope mapping experiments and extensive analog peptide structure-function analysis, will lead to a more detailed understanding of the LBP-LPS interaction (studies in progress). We thank B. Scallon for kindly providing the LBP-Ig and purified recombinant LBP used in these studies and Marian Kruszynski, Robert Weber, and Margret Falcone for synthesis, purification, and physical characterization of the LBP-related peptides."

Two mutant proteins (R72A and R72K) were purified and characterized. With Arg to Ala substitution the kcat of the polymerase reaction was reduced by nearly 100-fold with poly(rA) template, but only about 5-15-fold with poly(rC) and poly(dC) templates. The Arg to Lys substitution exhibited a qualitatively similar pattern, although the overall reduction in kcat was less severe. Most interestingly, we noted a large difference in the rate constant of the first and second nucleotide incorporation by R72A, suggesting that Arg72 participates in the reaction after the formation of the first phosphodiester bond. We propose this step to be the pyrophosphate binding and removal step following the nucleotidyltransferase reaction. Support for this proposal is obtained from the observation that the R72A mutant (i) exhibited a pronounced translocation defect in the processivity analysis, (ii) lacked the ability to catalyze pyrophosphorolysis, and (iii) showed complete resistance to phosphonoformate, an analog of PPi.

It is processed initially from the pol gene product as a 66-kDa polypeptide(2Hansen J. Schulze T. Moelling K. J. Biol.

HIV-1 RT shares some common features with other DNA polymerases, including a large cleft that accommodates the TP, formed by structurally similar three-dimensional motifs which have been called palm, fingers, and thumb(5Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar, 6Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L.

In the cleft of the enzyme resides the “catalytic triad” of three acidic residues. These residues are Asp110, Asp185, and Asp186 of the p66 subunit of HIV-1 RT(7LeGrice S.F.J. Naas T. Wohlgensinger B. Schatz O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3905-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). They are proposed to bind to the divalent metal ion(s) required for the polymerase activity(5Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar, 7LeGrice S.F.J. Naas T. Wohlgensinger B. Schatz O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3905-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), thereby, indirectly affecting the binding of the dNTP•Mg complex. In addition, other neighboring residues are expected to participate in other vital processes, such as dNTP binding, pyrophosphate product removal, and translocation along the template primer. To our knowledge, with the exception of Q151(16), no other residue in HIV-1 RT has been experimentally shown to participate either in the dNTP binding function or in the PPi removal function. The observation that resistance to a number of nucleoside-analog inhibitors in RT is associated with mutation(s) of some residue(s) in the region spanning 65-74 has suggested a possible influence of this region in the dNTP binding function. Furthermore, an antibody against an oligopeptide containing the amino acid sequence of this region inhibited the polymerase activity competitively, with respect to dNTP(8Wu J. Amandoron E. Li X. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9980-9985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the activities of most of these mutants were either unaffected or only slightly reduced(9Boyer P.L. Ferris A.L. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 1993; 66: 7533-7537Crossref Google Scholar). In the case of L74V the Ki for ddATP was found to be increased but no change in Kmfor dATP was apparent(10Martin J.L. Wilson J.E. Haynes R.L. Furman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6135-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), implying no direct role for Leu74 in dNTP binding. Recent studies have suggested that this region could be involved in the binding of template-strand binding (11Boyer P.L. Tantillo C. Jacobo-Molina A. Nanni R.G. Ding J. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4882-4885Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) rather than of dNTP. Therefore, a considerable degree of uncertainty exists regarding the role of residues in this region. reverse transcriptase deoxynucleotide triphosphate polydeoxycytidine-(deoxyguanosine)15 phosphonoformic acid Klenow fragment pyrophosphate polyriboadenosine-(thymidine)15 polyribocytidine (deoxyguanosine)15 template-primer wild type dithiothreitol. Kinetic nomenclature and constants are according to Cleland (1). Unless indicated otherwise, the terms R72A and R72K refer to p66R72A/p66R72A and p66R72K/p66R72K respectively. We have chosen Arg72 as a target for in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the role of this region in general and that of Arg72 in particular. The choice was based on the fact that our comparative modeling studies of the Klenow fragment (KF) and HIV-1 RT have suggested a spatially equivalent location of Arg72 of RT with that of Lys758 of KF(12Yadav P.N.S. Yadav J.S. Arnold E. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 716-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies on Lys758 of KF had implicated it in both the dNTP binding function and in the translocation of enzyme across the template(13Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13259-13265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present work provides experimental evidence regarding the role of Arg72, using the R72A and R72K mutants of HIV-1 RT. Furthermore, in order to determine the subunit specificity, if any, we examined the properties of reconstituted hybrid heterodimers, containing mutations only in one subunit (p66wt/p51R72A and p66R72A/p51wt). Our results show that the mutational effects of Arg72 are expressed through the p66 (and not the p51) subunit. In addition, Arg72 does not appear to be required for dNTP or DNA binding. The severe impairment in the processive mode of DNA synthesis by R72A together with the inability to catalyze pyrophosphorolysis and the complete resistance to phosphonoformate (a PPi analog), strongly implicate Arg72 in the PPi binding/removal function of HIV-1 RT.

Typically, an aliquot containing approximately 4 nM of WT or 12 nM of mutant enzyme in a final volume of 100 μl was incubated at 37°C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of MgCl2, terminated by 5% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, filtered with Whatman GF/B filters, and counted for radioactivity(17Pandey V.N. Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7744-7748Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The kinetic studies were carried out as described by Majumdar et al.(18Majumdar C. Abbotts J.

Km values for dNTP were determined at saturating TP concentrations (200 nM), whereas Km values for DNA at saturating dNTP concentrations (0.15 mM). Inhibition constants (Ki values) were determined from Dixon plots, as described previously(18Majumdar C. Abbotts J. Broder S. Wilson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15657-15665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic experiments were performed at least twice, and values were averages of at least duplicate experiments. Standard deviations for Kiand IC50 values were <15%. Assays were performed as described elsewhere(15Basu A. Tirumalai R.S. Modak M.J. J. Biol.

Incubations were for 1 h at 37°C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 1% SDS, 40 mM EDTA, 0.06% bromphenol blue, 0.06% xylene cyanol, and 90% formamide. The reaction products were analyzed on a 16% polyacrylamide-8 M urea gel and located by autoradiography(16Sarafianos S.G. Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J.

These vectors also contained the metal binding hexahistidine sequences at the N-terminal region. The XbaI and SacI fragment of pET-28a-RT51 encoding the polymerase domain of RT was subcloned in M13mp18 and used as the template for site-directed mutagenesis(16Sarafianos S.G. Pandey V.N.

After ascertaining the mutation in M13, it was introduced into the desired expression cassette and expressed in E. coli BL-21 (DE-3). Cell-free extracts, prepared as suggested by the manufacturer of the pET-28a system (Novagene), were applied to the pre-equilibrated (2.5 ml) Ni2+-charged IDA-Sepharose column (1 ml/min flow rate). The column was washed extensively until the A280 was reduced to negligible level. A second wash (5 ml) with a buffer containing 60 mM imidazole, 40 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.5 M NaCl removed all weakly bound proteins. The RT was eluted with 5 ml of 400 mM imidazole, 40 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 0.2 M NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1 mM DTT, and 50% glycerol. The eluted proteins were >98% pure, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(20Chattopadhyay D. Evans D.B. Deibel Jr., M.R. Vosters A.F. Eckenrode F.M. Einspahr H.M. Hui J.O.

Protein preparations were stable for several months at −20°C. Different combinations of chimeric heterodimers were prepared by reconstitution of separate subunits, achieved by mixing cell lysates of different bacterial strains at the appropriate ratios(7LeGrice S.F.J. Naas T. Wohlgensinger B. Schatz O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3905-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 20Chattopadhyay D. Evans D.B. Deibel Jr., M.R. Vosters A.F. Eckenrode F.M. Einspahr H.M.

Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad kit as well as direct spectrophotometric measurements(21Muller B. Restle T. Weiss S. Gautel M. Sczakiel G. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13975-13978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of incorporation of first ([32P]dTMP) and second nucleotide ([32P]dAMP) into the 47/18 TP were measured in separate experiments. For the first nucleotide, the standard reaction mixture contained 150 nM TP, 20 μM of [32P]dTTP, and 400 nM enzyme. For the second nucleotide, the mixture contained 100 μM non-radioactive dTTP (for complete addition of the first nucleotide) and 20 μM of [32P]dATP. Reactions were initiated at 25°C by the addition of MgCl2 (2 mM final), and aliquots were withdrawn at the indicated time intervals; incorporation of radiolabeled substrate was determined by acid precipitation. The first-order rate of single nucleotide incorporation in E/template-primer was measured from the slope of the first order plot of ln{[E-TP]remaining/[E-TP]initial} versus time. The “initial” concentration of E-TP was estimated from the amount of dNTP incorporated in E-TP at prolonged incubation (30 min), assuming 1:1 stoichiometry. The amount of E-TP remaining unused at time t is the difference between the amount incorporated at prolonged incubation and the amount incorporated at time t. Incorporation was calculated from the specific radioactivity of [α-32P]dTTP. The cross-linking of enzyme to DNA was carried out as described previously(13Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13259-13265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Setlow P. Brutlag D. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 224-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the 47/18 TP (see Fig. 4 for nucleotide sequence). The 5′-end-labeling of the 18-mer was performed using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(23Pandey V. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21828-21834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the primer strand was essential for reproducibility, as the synthetic primers were contaminated with shorter species with lower affinity for the DNA-binding site. The purified primer was appropriately diluted with unlabeled gel-purified 18-mer and annealed to equimolar amounts of unlabeled 47-mer. For the calculation of Kd for the enzyme-47/18 complex, 60 nM enzyme was incubated on ice for 10 min with variable concentrations of labeled 47/18 (2-100 nM, 100,000 disintegrations/min/pmol). The reaction mixture contained 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol. The samples were then exposed to UV light, and the cross-linked species were resolved as before(16Sarafianos S.G. Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7207-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by Scatchard plot analysis. In addition, plots of bound DNA versus the logarithm of free DNA were included, in order to ensure that the data actually determine a dissociation constant(24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 5.68-5.72Google Scholar). Fitting of the data to nonlinear binding curves was performed using the DELTAGRAPH software package. 1) For qualitative measurements of the processivity of DNA synthesis by mutant and WT enzymes, we used poly(rA)•(dT)15 as well as the 47/18-mer TPs. The 15- and 18-mer primers were 5′-32P-labeled and annealed with 2-fold molar excess of the respective template strand. 200-500 nM of enzyme were preincubated with 2 nM of the labeled TP, in an incubation mixture containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mM MgCl2 at a final volume of 3 μl. After a 1-min incubation at room temperature, polymerization was initiated by the addition of 3 μl of 200 μM dNTPs (50 μM each) and 2 mg/ml calf thymus DNA trap(25Klotz I.M. Science. 1982; 217: 1247-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The reaction was allowed to continue at 25°C; 2.5-μl samples were aliquoted at the indicated time points, mixed with 1 μl of 0.5% SDS and 100 mM EDTA, and frozen in dry-ice until further analysis. The products were analyzed on a denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 M urea, followed by autoradiography. 2) The quantitative processivity studies were essentially as before (26Joyce C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10858-10866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (final volume 0.5 ml) contained 40 nM WT or 60 nM mutant RTs, 200 nM poly(rA)•(dT)15 (annealed at a 1:1 ratio with respect to the 5′-ends), 0.03 mM [3H]dNTP, 80 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 2 mM to initiate control reactions, MgCl2 and 100 μM non-substrate homopolymeric trap to initiate the processivity reactions. The mixture was incubated at 25°C, and aliquots of 25 μl were removed at indicated times and processed as above. We observed no significant effect in the processivity of R72A at dNTP concentrations up to 100 μM. Our WT RT expression system yielded a protein with kinetic constants similar to other recombinant HIV-1 RTs (Table 1, 18, 16). These results suggest that the hexahistidine regions contained in the recombinant RT did not affect the polymerization mechanism. The level of expressed RT protein, solubility, yield, and the chromatographic characteristics of the mutant and WT enzyme were identical, suggesting that the enzyme structure was intact. In addition, assays performed at different temperatures showed that the activity of WT and mutants dropped concurrently at 55°C (data not shown), suggesting that all enzymes had the same denaturation temperature, reflecting no changes in the native conformation and three-dimensional folding. Finally, energy calculation of the local effect of the substitutions by the SYBYL molecular modeling program show no major disturbance in the three-dimensional enzyme structure.Table I Open table in a new tab The effect of mutation at Arg72 of RT was dependent on the TP used to assay the polymerization. The impairment in polymerization was nearly an order of magnitude higher with poly(rA)•(dT)15 than with poly(rC)•(dG)15 (Table 1); the kcat for poly(rA)•(dT)15 extension decreased by 100-fold for p66R72A/p66R72A and p66R72A/p51wt, as compared to p66wt/p66wt and p66wt/p51R72A, respectively. As the decreases in activity were smaller with poly(dC)•(dG)15, most of the inhibition studies were performed with this TP. There were only minor increases in the Km values of the mutant enzymes for dNTP (Table 1). At saturating dGTP concentrations, Km for poly(dC)•(dG)15 with all mutant and WT enzymes remained nearly identical, suggesting that there were no significant differences in the affinity of the enzymes for this TP. Comparison of the activities of reconstituted heterodimers to those of homodimers suggests: (i) the activities of homodimer RTs are slightly reduced compared to the corresponding heterodimers, and (ii) the effects of the mutation are through Arg72 of the p66 subunit, as p66wt/p51R72A retains WT activity. In contrast, p66R72A/p51wt is similar to p66R72A/p66R72A. The steady state kinetic experiments suggested that replacement of Arg72 had no effect on the ability of the enzyme to bind homopolymeric DNA. In order to confirm these results, and to extend them to heteropolymeric sequences, we performed binding studies by direct photochemical cross-linking of the E-TP complex. Irradiation with UV light brings about the formation of a “Zero length” covalent bond (27Bryant F.R. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3537-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) between the enzyme and the associated TP, thereby, freezing the interaction between them. The DNA binds at the active site of the enzyme in a specific and catalytically relevant manner as demonstrated by the inability of either poly(rA) template or oligo(dT) primer alone to prevent cross-linking, as well as by the competition by poly(rA)•(dT)15 (results not shown). As judged by the extent of cross-linkings, both the mutant and the wild type enzymes show similar binding affinity for the 18/47-mer (Fig. 1). Semilogarithmic graphs of Bound versus Free DNA were fit in binding isotherms [(Bound DNA) = maxBound DNA ∗ Free DNA/Kd+ Free DNA]. At even higher DNA concentrations, the amount of Bound DNA did not increase (results not shown). The dissociation constants calculated from the slopes (−1/Kd) of Scatchard plots (Fig. 1) were 29 and 25 nM, for the binding of 18/47 to wild type and [R72A] enzymes, respectively. A number of residues in the vicinity of Arg72 seem to be involved in viral resistance to dideoxynucleoside inhibitors, raising the possibility that Arg72 may be involved in the binding of these compounds. In order to determine if the mutation at Arg72 affected the inhibition of RT by ddGTP, a typical dose-response study was carried out. As shown in Table 2, the IC50 of ddGTP inhibition with poly(dC)•(dG)15 as TP by WT and R72A are unaffected. Nevirapine, known to bind at a different site of the RT polymerase domain(5Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar), was also equally effective in inhibiting the mutant and WT enzymes (Table 2). These results show that Arg72 does not participate in the binding of these inhibitors. However, R72A exhibited moderate susceptibility to inhibition by PPi. The inhibition constants (Ki) calculated from Dixon plots (not shown) were 0.71 and 0.58 mM for R72A and WT, respectively, with poly(dC)•(dG)15 as the TP (Table 2). Most interestingly, PFA, a PPi analog, did not inhibit R72A even at millimolar concentrations (Table 2). Resistance of R72A to PFA was also observed when 18/47 was used as TP. It may be pointed out that the Ki for the inhibition of WT RT by PPi or PFA are significantly lower with poly(rA)•(dT)15 as TP (10Martin J.L. Wilson J.E. Haynes R.L. Furman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6135-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Majumdar C. Abbotts J. Broder S. Wilson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15657-15665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, since R72A does not utilize this TP efficiently, we could not ascertain insensitivity of poly(rA)•(dT)15-directed DNA synthesis to PFA. The effects of the mutation on the susceptibility of RT to PFA are through Arg72 of the p66 subunit, as p66wt/p51R72A retains WT kinetic constants and inhibition profile (Table 2). In contrast, p66R72A/p51wt is not inhibited by PFA (Table 2). These results suggest that Arg72 of p66 may be located at (or proximal to) the PPi-binding site and/or there are subtle, yet potentially substantial differences in the binding of PPi and PFA to RT that are magnified in the absence of arginine at the 72 position. Interestingly, R72K retained sensitivity to PFA (results not shown).Table II Open table in a new tab In order to verify that the defect of R72A is in the pyrophosphate binding/release function, we examined the ability of WT and mutants to perform the reverse reaction, namely pyrophosphorolysis. As seen in Fig. 2, the WT RT utilizes PPi to hydrolyze the 18-mer primer of the 47/18 TP, as noted by the appearance of smaller size DNA fragments (lane 2). No pyrophosphorolysis products are observed in the absence of PPi (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 3, and 5). Interestingly, R72A with mutations in only p66 (Fig. 2, lanes 3and 4) or in both subunits (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6) was unable to catalyze pyrophosphorolysis (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 6), presumably, due to inability of R72A to bind PPi in the absence of Arg72. Another assessment of the polymerase function is its ability, once bound to TP, to successively add dNTPs to the growing chain prior to dissociation from the replication complex. When either WT RT or R72A were incubated with saturating amounts of TP, the polymerization reaction time course followed the following relationship N/E = (kcat/koff)(1 - exp(-kofft)). N/E is the number of additions/processive cycle/mole of E-polymer, kcat is the steady state rate constant for polymerization, and koff is the rate constant for the dissociation of E-polymer(20Chattopadhyay D. Evans D.B. Deibel Jr., M.R. Vosters A.F. Eckenrode F.M. Einspahr H.M. Hui J.O. Tomaselli A.G. Zurcher-Neely H.A. Heinrikson R.L. Sharma S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14227-14232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After a sufficiently long time period, (t1/kcat), a true plateau representing the complete dissociation of all productively bound RT molecules was achieved. The plateau is described by the relationship (N/E)f = kcat/koff. (N/E)f is the limiting value for incorporation of dTTP into polymer. Values for kcat were calculated from control reactions where the DNA trap was omitted from the reaction protocol(27Bryant F.R. Johnson K.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3537-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The results of two trap experiments are summarized in Fig. 3. These data indicate that the majority of p66R72A/p51WT molecules are able to extend the primer only by one nucleotide in the presence of trap. Additional evidence to support the defect of mutant in processivity was obtained using poly(rA)(dT)15 as TP (Fig. 4). In this experiment, the enzyme was first incubated with poly(rA)32P(dT)15, followed by the addition of both trap and TTP. The extension of 32P-labeled (dT)15 was then monitored at 1 or 10 min time intervals, and the products were analyzed on a 20% urea-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2 of p66R72A/p51wt). Most interestingly, the mutant enzyme even in the absence of DNA trap extended the poly(rA)(dT)15 TP by only one or two nucleotides (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4 of p66R72A/p51wt). In contrast, WT was efficient in RNA-directed DNA synthesis, with or without DNA trap (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-4 of p66wt/p51R72A). Similar, though less dramatic, results were observed with 47/18-mer as TP. In the presence of trap it is observed that the majority of extended primers by p66R72A/p51wt in 1 or 10 min are of the n+1 size (n = size of original primer) (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2 of p66R72A/p51wt). However, without DNA trap, the same enzyme is able to add a few more nucleotides (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4 of p66R72A/p51wt). Once again, a substantial number of WT RT molecules (Fig. 4B, lanes 1-3 of p66wt/p51R72A) are able to copy the full-length of template in the presence or absence of trap. The reduced processivity of R72A probably resulted from the extended stalling of p66R72A/p51wt by remaining bound to the TP, followed by dissociation from the TP. Evidence for the former is the observed increase of the pro"

https://openalex.org/W2060414966,"CD59 antigen is a membrane glycoprotein that inhibits the activity of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex (MAC), thereby protecting human cells from lysis by human complement. The inhibitory function of CD59 derives from its capacity to interact with both the C8 and C9 components of MAC, preventing assembly of membrane-inserted C9 polymer. MAC-inhibitory activity of CD59 is species-selective and is most effective when both C8 and C9 derive from human or other primate plasma. Rabbit C8 and C9, which can substitute for human C8 and C9 in MAC, mediate virtually unrestricted lysis of human cells expressing CD59. In order to identify the segment of human C8 that is recognized by CD59, recombinant peptides containing human or rabbit C8 sequence were expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and purified. CD59 was found to specifically bind to a peptide corresponding to residues 334-385 of the human C8 α-subunit, and to require a disulfide bond between Cys<sup>345</sup> and Cys<sup>369</sup>. No specific binding was observed to the corresponding sequence from rabbit C8α (residues 334-386). To obtain functional evidence that this segment of human C8α is selectively recognized by CD59, recombinant C8 proteins were prepared by co-transfecting COS-7 cells with human/rabbit chimeras of the C8α cDNA, and cDNAs encoding the C8β and C8γ chains. Hemolytic activity of MAC formed with chimeric C8 was analyzed using target cells reconstituted with CD59. These experiments confirmed that CD59 recognizes a conformationally sensitive epitope that is within a segment of human C8α internal to residues 320-415. Our data also suggest that optimal interaction of CD59 with this segment of human C8α is influenced by N-terminal flanking sequence in C8α and by human C8β, but is unaffected by C8γ."
https://openalex.org/W1483690774,"Integrins bind extracellular matrix and transduce signals mediating cell adhesion, spreading, and migration. It is unclear how these distinct responses follow from a common event: integrin clustering. We examined the relationship between integrin-mediated signals and the integrin's activation state using a cell line expressing αIIbβ3 (Clone B) and a panel of monoclonal antibodies against this integrin. Nonactivating antibodies used to cluster αIIbβ3 stimulated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation, regardless of affinity, subunit specificity, or ligand-blocking phenotype. Coated on plastic, these antibodies supported cell adhesion, spreading, and FAK phosphorylation. In contrast, clustering of αIIbβ3 induced with activating antibodies, or binding of soluble fibrinogen to antibody-activated αIIbβ3, did not induce FAK phosphorylation. Thus, clustering of αIIbβ3 on Clone B does not necessarily result in FAK phosphorylation. Coated on plastic, activating antibodies supported cell adhesion, but not spreading or FAK phosphorylation. Therefore, it appears the resting, not the active form of αIIbβ3, induces cell spreading and FAK phosphorylation in Clone B. These data indicate that “inside-out” signals may alter not only the binding specificity of an integrin, but the “outside-in” biochemical signals that integrin initiates as well.

This activation state-linked signaling represents a novel mechanism, which may explain how diverse cellular responses are induced by integrin-matrix interactions. Integrins comprise a large family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors involved in cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. These receptors mediate adhesion and modulate the cell's responses to various adhesive ligands (for review, see (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar)). The integrins role in modulating information flow recently has become a field of growing interest. Several potentially significant biochemical changes are known now to be regulated by adhesion events involving integrins, including changes in intracellular pH, changes and oscillations in intracellular free calcium, and phosphorylation on tyrosine of a number of proteins (2Schwartz M.A. Lechene C. Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7849-7853Google Scholar, 3Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Google Scholar, 4Guan J.L.

In addition to this “outside-in” signaling, the binding affinities and specificities of several integrins are known to be modulated by events inside the cell: so-called “inside-out” signaling or activation (10Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 155-162Google Scholar, 11O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1991; 254: 845-847Google Scholar) (for review, see (12Ginsberg M.H. Du X. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 766-771Google Scholar)). One of the best studied examples of this occurs in the case of the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (GPIIbIIIa). This integrin can exist in different activation states that can be distinguished by differences in ligand binding as well as the binding of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for these states(13Shattil S. Curr. Studies in Hematology & Blood Transfusion. 1991; : 26-31Google Scholar). In the so-called “resting” state, αIIbβ3 binds solid-phase fibrinogen, but does not bind the soluble form of fibrinogen, which is found in abundance in plasma. A wide variety of stimuli can induce platelet activation, which in turn results in an apparent conformation change or “activation” of αIIbβ3. This “active” state can bind soluble fibrinogen and other molecules important to thrombus formation, such as von Willebrand factor(14Hawiger J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 614: 270-278Google Scholar). Since the resting form of the receptor is active for binding some ligands, it may be more appropriate to describe it as expressing “basal” activity. The role of αIIbβ3 in outside-in signaling has been examined in platelets (see (3Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Google Scholar) and (15Huang M.M. Lipfert L. Cunningham M. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 473-483Google Scholar), and references therein) and in a model system in which αIIbβ3 is expressed in 293 cells (ATCC 1573). In platelets, stimulation of αIIbβ3 either by adhesion to fibrinogen or by antibody-mediated clustering is associated with increases in protein-tyrosine phosphorylation(3Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Google Scholar, 15Huang M.M. Lipfert L. Cunningham M. Brugge J.S. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 473-483Google Scholar). Likewise, adhesion of the transfected 293 cells, designated “Clone B”(5Pelletier A.J. Bodary S.C. Levinson A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 989-998Google Scholar), to solid-phase fibrinogen via αIIbβ3 or clustering of αIIbβ3 with antibodies induces very rapid protein-tyrosine phosphorylation. We have identified FAK as one of the rapidly phosphorylated proteins resulting from αIIbβ3 cross-linking in Clone B (see below). The fact that many integrin-mediated biochemical changes can be induced either partially or fully by clustering of specific integrins with antibodies has given rise to a paradigm that the biochemical signals are initiated by clustering of the receptor, as occurs at the site of adhesion(6Kornberg L.J.

Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14738-14745Google Scholar). However, this simple model does not explain adequately the diverse cellular responses that can be mediated by a single integrin. For example, focal adhesion formation and migration would seem to require very different signals. If a single integrin is capable of directing both, it logical to propose that it may be able to mediate different signals. Given the variations in activation state known to exist for αIIbβ3, we hypothesized that activation state affects the outside-in signals mediated by this receptor. To test this, we took advantage of a class of anti-αIIbβ3 antibodies that activate αIIbβ3(17Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Google Scholar). That is, when one of these antibodies binds, it induces a change in the receptor that is characterized by binding soluble fibrinogen and activation-specific antibodies. These activating antibodies provide a method for examining the active form of the integrin without activating inside-out pathways, which could complicate interpretation of the results(18Du X. Gu M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Google Scholar). We used Clone B (5Pelletier A.J. Bodary S.C. Levinson A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 989-998Google Scholar) and a panel of activating or nonactivating mAbs to different epitopes on αIIbβ3 to test our hypothesis. We found that clustering of αIIbβ3 in the active state, whether mediated by antibodies or by soluble fibrinogen, did not stimulate phosphorylation of FAK. In contrast, clustering with nonactivating antibodies did. Moreover, when plated in solid phase, antibodies that induce the active state of αIIbβ3 supported adhesion, but did not induce spreading or FAK phosphorylation. In contrast, those antibodies that did not induce the active state supported adhesion and induced spreading and FAK phosphorylation. We therefore establish a link between the integrin's activity state and its signaling ability. It may be important to consider this link when defining how integrins regulate cellular processes and when designing means of intervention into these processes. Clone B has been described elsewhere (5Pelletier A.J. Bodary S.C. Levinson A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 989-998Google Scholar). Briefly, it is a derivative of the transformed human kidney epithelial cell line “293” (ATCC 1573) that has been stably transfected with cDNAs for the human β3 and αIIb integrin subunits. The parent cell line expresses neither of these integrins. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum and including a penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic mix. The clone was selected from a three-plasmid cotransfection including a neor plasmid by growth in G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). However, the transfection is stable, and cells are no longer grown in the presence of G418. Instead, cells are monitored for changes in morphology and screened periodically for expression of αIIb and β3. The cell line has been re-cloned by A. J. Pelletier since its original isolation, and the current strain is designated B.1. Medium for antibody-mediated clustering (see below) was RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker) with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). RPMI 1640 was chosen for its moderate levels of divalent cations (0.2 mM Mg2+ and 0.4 mM Ca2+). Lysis solution: 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) in Tris-buffered normal saline (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5) containing 100 μM sodium metavanadate (Sigma) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Western blocking solution: 1% Tween 20 (polyoxyethelenesorbitan monolaurate, Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 1% gelatin (from bovine skin, Sigma); Western wash solution: same as block without gelatin; cell wash buffer for flow cytometry: PBS without divalent cations plus 1% BSA (Sigma) and 0.1% sodium azide (Sigma). Immune-precipitation buffer contains 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 150 mM NaCl, to which 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 μM sodium metavanadate were added immediately prior to use. Antibody 9D4 was generated at Genentech Inc. and was the kind gift of Dr. Jin Kim and Genentech(19Chuntharapai A. Bodary S. Horton M. Kim K.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 345-352Google Scholar). LIBS6 was the kind gift of Dr. Mark Ginsberg. AP5 was described elsewhere(36Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Google Scholar). All other anti β3 and anti-αIIbβ3 complex antibodies were generated in the lab of Dr. Z. Ruggeri and have been described elsewhere(20Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Google Scholar, 21Lombardo V.T. Hodson E. Roberts J.R. Kunicki T.J. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1950-1958Google Scholar, 22Niiya K. Hodson E. Bader R. Byers-Ward V. Koziol J.A. Plow E.F. Ruggeri Z.M. Blood. 1987; 70: 475-483Google Scholar). Control antibodies for clustering were P3 (an anti-GP1b(23Handa M. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Roberts J.R. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12579-12585Google Scholar)) and P10 (which binds an unidentified protein on the cell surface).2 2A. J. Pelletier, unpublished observations. Both were raised in the laboratory of Z. M. Ruggeri. For all of the experiments presented here, the secondary antiserum was an affinity-purified polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImunoResearch, West Grove, PA). In other experiments, goat anti-mouse Fc (Jackson), and rabbit anti-mouse (raised at Genentech, Inc.) were used with comparable results. Human fibrinogen was the kind gift of Dr. Brunhilde Felding-Habermann. Cells were grown for assay in 10-cm tissue culture-treated Petri dishes (various). Subconfluent plates were harvested by washing twice with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS and treating with 2 mM EDTA (in PBS) at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were re-suspended in HEPES-buffered RPMI 1640 (10 mM HEPES) and triturated to obtain single cells. They then were centrifuged at low speed at room temperature and re-suspended in fresh RPMI/HEPES a total of three times and brought to a final density of approximately 1-2 × 106 cells/ml. The basic assay was as follows: 100 μl of cells in 1.6-ml microcentrifuge tubes were treated with primary and secondary (where appropriate) for times indicated at 37°C. Following incubation, cells were quenched on ice, pelleted at low speed for 20 s, and transferred back to ice. Medium was aspirated and cells were lysed in 30-50 μl of lysis solution. Following 15 min on ice, lysates were cleared by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. In the case of adhered cells, they were lysed in the wells with lysis buffer, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and cleared as above. Relative protein concentrations were determined with the use of a modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). In experiments designated “plus RGD” cells were treated at 40 μM with the synthetic cyclic peptide G4120 (24Barker P.L. Bullens S. Bunting S. Burdick D.J. Chan K.S. Deisher T. Eigenbrot C. Gadek T.R. Gantzos R. Lipari M.T. Muir C.D. Napier M.A. Pitti R.M. Padua A. Quan C. Stanley M. Struble M. Tom J.Y.K. Burnier J.P. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 2040-2048Google Scholar) (kind gift of Dr. Thomas Gadek and Genentech Inc.) for 5 min prior to or simultaneously with addition of the antibodies. G4120 has a high affinity for αIIbβ3 and inhibits platelet adhesion to fibrinogen with an IC50 of 0.15 μM(24Barker P.L. Bullens S. Bunting S. Burdick D.J. Chan K.S. Deisher T. Eigenbrot C. Gadek T.R. Gantzos R. Lipari M.T. Muir C.D. Napier M.A. Pitti R.M. Padua A. Quan C. Stanley M. Struble M. Tom J.Y.K. Burnier J.P. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 2040-2048Google Scholar). Adhesion of Clone B to fibrinogen is completely abolished at 20 μM(5Pelletier A.J. Bodary S.C. Levinson A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 989-998Google Scholar). The dose of 40 μM was chosen because, by all functional criteria, it appeared to be well in excess of saturation. For fibrinogen-mediated stimulation, cells were pretreated with AP5 at 100 μg/ml for 15 min on ice in HEPES-buffered RPMI 1640. Fibrinogen was added at the indicated concentrations, and incubations were carried out at 37°C for 10 min. In the past, I have found that the issue of stimulation by soluble fibrinogen is complicated by the binding of fibrinogen to the sides of the tube and subsequent binding of the cells to the solid-phase fibrinogen, even under these short incubations. This problem was avoided by carefully pipetting only those cells in suspension into a new, ice-cold tube and collecting and lysing them as described above. Immunoprecipitations from precleared lysates were performed using standard protocols in lysis buffer. Anti-FAK mAb, 2A7, was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY and used at the recommended dilution. Immune complexes were precipitated with anti-mouse IgG-agarose (Sigma). For Western analysis, equal protein amounts of each lysate were diluted 1:1 with 2 × loading dye and electrophoresed on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (37.5:1 acrylamide:bis) at 60 volts for 15 h. Transfer to Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was performed in CAPS (Sigma) buffer as described(5Pelletier A.J. Bodary S.C. Levinson A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 989-998Google Scholar). All incubations below were performed at room temperature on a rocking or orbital platform. Blots were air-dried, re-wetted in methanol, blocked for 2 h in blocking buffer, exposed to primary antibody (anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer for 45 min, washed three times, 15 min each, with wash solution, exposed to the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunological) in blocking buffer for 30 min, and finally washed several times for 15 min each in wash solution. Visualization was achieved with the Renaissance™ chemiluminescence reagent (DuPont NEN). FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-labeled AP5 was generated by incubation of 1 mg of AP5 with 0.1 mg FITC-Cellite (Sigma) in the dark at room temperature for 45 min (in 100 mM sodium carbonate, pH 9.0). Cellite was removed from suspension by centrifugation, and labeled antibody was separated from free FITC by chromatography on a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Relative incorporation was determined by comparing A280 to A493. Cells were removed from growth plates with 2 mM EDTA in PBS as above, washed twice with cell wash buffer, and exposed to appropriate control or experimental antibodies for 30 min on ice in cell wash buffer (concentrations as indicated in figures). When RGD is specified, G4120 was used at 40 μM. Cells were treated with propidium iodide (Sigma, 500 ng/ml, final) just prior to flow cytometry, which was performed on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan with “Lysys II” software. Appropriate forward and side scatter gates were set for these cells, and only those cells excluding propidium iodide were counted. Cells were prepared for antibody-mediated clustering as above except that they were plated on polylysine-coated coverslips following the washes (polylysine (Sigma)-coated at 0.01% overnight at 4°C). Cells were treated with primary and secondary antibodies exactly as described for suspension assays above. The concentration of AP5 used was 100 μg/ml and G4120 (40 μM) was included to enhance binding. P9 was used at 4 μg/ml. After 5 min, cells were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde (Malinkrodt Specialty Chemicals, Paris, KY), for 15 min at 4°C. Following washes with PBS and blocking with PBS plus 0.5% BSA, cells were treated with a FITC-labeled donkey anti-goat tertiary antibody for visualization of the integrin-immune clusters. Cells were mounted in Mowiol™ (Calbiochem) and visualized on a Zeiss LSM-4 confocal imaging system. 125I-Fibrinogen was prepared in the laboratory of Z. M. Ruggeri as described(20Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Google Scholar). Cells were removed from plates and washed exactly as described above and incubated on ice for 15 min either with 100 μg/ml AP5 or P4 (a nonblocking, nonactivating anti-αIIbβ3) as a control. Assays were performed in 0.8-ml microcentrifuge tubes that had been blocked for 2 h with 1.0% heat-denatured BSA (in PBS). Aliquots of 105 treated cells were transferred to assay tubes either with or without 40 μM RGD, and 125I-fibrinogen at the indicated concentrations was added (assays all in duplicate). Incubation was carried out for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed with 500 μl of ice-cold PBS containing 1.0% BSA, collected by low speed centrifugation, and re-suspended in cold PBS/BSA by gentle vortexing. A total of three washes were performed. After the final wash, the cells were re-suspended in 200 μl of PBS/BSA and transferred to scintillation vials, followed by the addition of 5 ml of “Safety-Solve” (Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) and gentle vortexing. Counts were measured on a Beckman Gamma 8000 scintillation counter for 5 min each tube. For each concentration of fibrinogen, the amount of bound 125I detected in the assays containing RGD was considered nonspecific binding and was subtracted from total counts to. The remaining RGD-inhibitable counts were considered specific binding of 125I-fibrinogen. Both the raw counts, and the RGD-sensitive, or specific, counts are presented in the figure. Antibodies (50 μg/ml in PBS) or fibrinogen (20 μg/ml in PBS) or BSA as a negative control (1% in PBS) were adsorbed to 48-well, non-tissue culture-treated plates for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed twice with PBS and blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 1% BSA in PBS. Cells were prepared for adhesion assays in the same way as for antibody-mediated clustering. Approximately 5 × 104 cells were plated per well, either in the presence or absence of G4120. Following a 30-min incubation at 37°, plates were washed three times by aspirating medium and gently adding 200 μl of warm medium. Finally, medium was aspirated and cells were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS containing 1% sucrose (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature and photographed. Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots showed that treatment of Clone B cells with a combination of a mAb to β3 (9D4 at 10 μg/ml) (19Chuntharapai A. Bodary S. Horton M. Kim K.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 205: 345-352Google Scholar) and a secondary (anti-mouse IgG at 10 μg/ml) antiserum resulted in stimulation of phosphorylation of two major bands in the 120-130-kDa range, while treatment with either antibody alone did not (data not shown). The time course of induction was rapid; phosphorylation of these proteins can be detected within 30 s and reached a maximum by 5 min (Fig. 1). The major phosphotyrosine-containing proteins detected comprised a pair of bands of approximate molecular weights 122,000 and 130,000. These bands correspond exactly to those induced by adhesion of Clone B to fibrinogen reported previously ((5Pelletier A.J. Bodary S.C. Levinson A.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 989-998Google Scholar) and see Fig. 11). Anti-FAK Western blots of Clone B lysates showed two bands that comigrated with the phosphotyrosine-containing proteins seen in Fig. 1(not shown). Immunoprecipitation with the anti-FAK monoclonal antibody, 2A7, but not a control mAb, precipitated two bands that were phosphorylated on tyrosine following antibody-mediated clustering of αIIbβ3 (Fig. 2). These bands were not detected in nonstimulated cells, and the time course of appearance roughly parallels that seen in Fig. 1. Moreover, they comigrated with the two major phosphotyrosine-containing bands in the whole lysate (Fig. 2). In vitro kinase activity experiments on, and peptide mapping of, anti-FAK immunoprecipitated material all support the conclusion that the two bands represent two forms of FAK.2 We conclude that this cell line expresses two electrophoretic variants of FAK and that both are phosphorylated on tyrosine following antibody-mediated clustering of αIIbβ3. The cause and significance of these electrophoretic variants is not known.Figure 11:In a parallel experiment to that shown in Fig. 10, lysates were harvested from cells adhered and spread on fibrinogen, 9D4, P9 and CP8, or from cells adhered on AP5 or LIBS6 (which also does not support spreading), subjected to SDS-PAGE and anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2:Both bands of the doublet are immunoprecipitated by the anti-FAK monoclonal antibody 2A7. Lysates of cells stimulated by antibody-mediated clustering of αIIbβ3 for the indicated times were divided in two and precipitated either with anti-FAK or a control, isotype-matched mAb (anti-beta4). The immunoprecipitates were subject to SDS-PAGE and anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot, as above. Numbers at left represent the positions of the indicated molecular mass standards. “L” is the whole cell lysate from the 5 min time point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) FAK phosphorylation was stimulated equally well by a wide range of mAbs specific to these integrin subunits or the αIIbβ3 complex. Several examples are shown in Fig. 3. Cells were treated either with the secondary antibody alone (“neg.”), 9D4 (10 μg/ml) plus secondary, or one of five mAbs (also 10 μg/ml) with or without the clustering secondary antibody (20 μg/ml), as indicated. The mAbs P4, P5, and P9 (20Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Google Scholar, 21Lombardo V.T. Hodson E. Roberts J.R. Kunicki T.J. Zimmerman T.S. Ruggeri Z.M. J.

Blood. 1987; 70: 475-483Google Scholar) all stimulated phosphorylation, but only in the presence of the secondary antibody. In contrast, the anti-GP1b mAb P3 (23Handa M. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Roberts J.R. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12579-12585Google Scholar), which does not bind to clone B, and P10, which binds an unidentified cell surface protein on Clone B (details under “Materials and Methods”), were not capable of stimulating FAK phosphorylation. These controls indicate that FAK phosphorylation is not the result of interactions of IgG molecules with the surface or a general effect of capping surface proteins. All αIIbβ3 mAbs were tested through a range of concentrations and, at optimal concentrations, stimulated phosphorylation to comparable levels. The optimal concentration for phosphorylation for each antibody generally was below saturation (not shown). Table 1 shows the antibodies tested and some of their characteristics. In summary, phosphorylation can be stimulated equally well by blocking, nonblocking, anti-β3, or anti-complex antibodies.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Different results were obtained with the activating mAb we have described recently, Ap5(36Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Google Scholar). Fig. 4 demonstrates that treatment of Clone B with AP5 plus secondary antisera did not induce phosphorylation of FAK. Tyrosine phosphorylation could not be detected in any trials with AP5 at concentrations ranging from saturation to those below detection for binding (see below for binding data). In some trials, incubation was carried out for 15 min, three times longer than that normally required for maximal phosphorylation, with no effect. Moreover, three different secondary antisera known to cooperate with other mAbs in stimulating FAK phosphorylation did not do so with AP5 (data not shown). Anti-FAK Western blots showed that FAK could be recovered equally well from lysates of AP5-stimulated cells as from those of cells stimulated by other antibodies (data not shown). AP5 is a member of a class of antibodies known as anti-LIBS (for ligand induced binding site)(25Frelinger III, A.L. Du X. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Google Scholar, 26Frelinger III, A.L. Cohen I. Plow E.F. Smith M.A. Roberts J. Lam S.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6346-6352Google Scholar). As a result, it requires the addition of a ligand analog to stimulate high levels of binding ((36Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Google Scholar) and Fig. 5). Although other low affinity antibodies, such as CP8 (Table 1), can stimulate FAK phosphorylation, it was important to exclude AP5's low affinity as a possible explanation. Accordingly, we tested a range of concentrations of AP5 in the presence of a"

The laying hen expresses, in a tissue-specific manner, at least four different proteins which belong to the same family of receptors as LRP/α2MR. Here we show that the chicken also produces RAP, so far thought to be expressed only in mammals. Studies on the interaction of recombinant human RAP with the LDL receptor family in the chicken revealed that RAP binds with high affinity to the abundant oocyte receptor for yolk precursors (OVR) as well as to the somatic cell-specific LRP/α2MR. Significantly, RAP interacts with a lower affinity with the LDL receptor, but does not bind to the oocyte-specific form of LRP. Binding of RAP to OVR inhibits the interaction of the receptor with all known physiological ligands, i.e. the yolk precursors very low density lipoprotein, vitellogenin, and α2-macroglobulin. In COS cells transfected with OVR, RAP is internalized and degraded in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner. Lactoferrin, another protein with a high affinity for mammalian LRP/α2MR, also binds to OVR and abolishes its interaction with yolk precursors.

The availability of pure OVR and LDLR enabled us to determine kinetic parameters for the binding of RAP and lactoferrin to these receptors by surface plasmon resonance.

https://openalex.org/W2038613606,"Urokinase (u-PA) is synthesized and secreted as a single-chain polypeptide (single-chain u-PA, scu-PA), which has such little enzymatic activity in solution that it has been considered essentially enzymatically inert. We found that plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), the major PAI in plasma, demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of this solution-phase scu-PA enzymatic activity. 125I-scu-PA formed complexes with PAI-1 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, as detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. Among a given population of scu-PA molecules, all measurable enzymatic activity was inhibited by a 10-fold molar excess of PAI-1. However, at this stoichiometry, only a minority of 125I-scu-PA molecules formed SDS-stable complexes with PAI-1 (i.e. complexes that formed a covalent bond upon denaturation), even though the uncomplexed PAI-1 molecules remained competent to inhibit u-PA enzymatic activity. Neither the extent nor the time course of complex formation was altered by using PAI-1 that had been pre-incubated with native human vitronectin, compared with native PAI-1 alone. 125I-scu-PA•PAI-1 complexes that would form a covalent bond if denatured were reversible and existed in equilibrium with either non-complexed or loosely complexed reactants. These data suggest that scu-PA has more enzyme-like properties than previously appreciated and raises the possibility that it resembles single-chain tissue type-plasminogen activator in lacking a complete zymogen conformation."

https://openalex.org/W2036745017,"The addition of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to hormone-dependent cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus protein kinase 2 (Jak2) and activates its in vitro kinase activity. To explore the role of Jak2 in IL-3/GM-CSF-mediated signal transduction, we constructed a CD16/CD7/Jak2 (CD16/Jak2) fusion gene containing the external domain of CD16 and the entire Jak2 molecule and expressed this fusion protein using a recombinant vaccinia virus. The clustering of CD16/Jak2 fusion protein by cross-linking with an anti-CD16 antibody induced autophosphorylation of the fusion protein but did not induce the phosphorylation of either the endogenous Jak2 or the β chain. Cross-linking of CD16/Jak2 stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of a large group of proteins that are also phosphorylated after the addition of IL-3 or GM-CSF and include proteins of 145, 97, 67, 52, and 42 kDa. Closer analysis demonstrated that the CD16/Jak2 phosphorylates Shc, a 52-kDa protein, and the 145-kDa protein associated tightly with Shc, as well as mitogen-associated protein kinase (pp42). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that CD16/Jak2 activates the ability of signal transduction and activation of transcription (STAT) proteins to bind to an inferon-γ-activated sequence oligonucleotide in a manner similar to that seen after IL-3 treatment. Cross-linking of the CD16/Jak2 protein stimulated increases in c-fos and junB similar to IL-3 but did not cause major changes in the levels of the c-myc message, which normally increases after IL-3 treatment. Thus, a transmembrane CD16/Jak2 fusion is capable of activating protein phosphorylation and mRNA transcription in a manner similar but not identical to hematopoietic growth factors. The addition of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to hormone-dependent cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus protein kinase 2 (Jak2) and activates its in vitro kinase activity.

Cross-linking of CD16/Jak2 stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of a large group of proteins that are also phosphorylated after the addition of IL-3 or GM-CSF and include proteins of 145, 97, 67, 52, and 42 kDa. Closer analysis demonstrated that the CD16/Jak2 phosphorylates Shc, a 52-kDa protein, and the 145-kDa protein associated tightly with Shc, as well as mitogen-associated protein kinase (pp42). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrate that CD16/Jak2 activates the ability of signal transduction and activation of transcription (STAT) proteins to bind to an inferon-γ-activated sequence oligonucleotide in a manner similar to that seen after IL-3 treatment. Cross-linking of the CD16/Jak2 protein stimulated increases in c-fos and junB similar to IL-3 but did not cause major changes in the levels of the c-myc message, which normally increases after IL-3 treatment. Thus, a transmembrane CD16/Jak2 fusion is capable of activating protein phosphorylation and mRNA transcription in a manner similar but not identical to hematopoietic growth factors.

Cell. 1991; 66: 1165-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). This β common subunit does not bind cytokine, but it associates with the α subunit to form the high affinity complex receptor. In humans there is a single β subunit, whereas in mice there are two highly homologous β chains. One (AIC2B) is shared by IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF(2Kitamura T. Hayashida K. Sakamaki K. Yokota T.

The β chains do not have a recognizable intracellular kinase domain, but they interact with Janus protein kinase 2 (Jak2) and activate its tyrosine kinase activity(5Quelle F.W. Sato N.

The phosphorylated 145-kDa protein, whose function is not known, appears to interact with the amino terminus of Shc(13Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (pp42) is phosphorylated and activated by the addition of the IL-3 or GM-CSF to factor-dependent cell lines(16Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M. Kraft A.S.

In addition, other proteins known to be phosphorylated after the addition of GM-CSF or IL-3 include Vav (18Alai M. Mui A.L. Cutler R.L. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Krystal G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19812-19817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using truncation mutants of the β chain it has been demonstrated that various regions of the β chain regulate specific signal transduction pathways(20Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). For example, deletion of the carboxyl-terminal 260 amino acids (β 626) prevented the activation of Ras, Raf-1, MAP kinase, and p70 S6 kinase. Also, in cells containing this truncation, GM-CSF-induced increases in the levels of c-fos and c-jun mRNAs could not be seen. Smaller truncation β chain mutants containing fewer than 517 amino acids were unable to induce c-myc and pim1 upon the addition of GM-CSF. One downstream effect of Jak stimulation is the activation of signal transduction and activation of transcription (STAT) proteins. These proteins are phosphorylated in the cytosol on tyrosine and then translocate to the nucleus where they bind to DNA or DNA-binding proteins and enhance the transcription of specific gene products. The addition of interferon-γ to cells activates Jak1 and Jak2 and causes STAT1 phosphorylation, leading to the transcriptional activation of a set of proteins, including guanylate-binding protein and Fc receptor γ(21Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). These proteins contain a consensus binding sequence, TTNCNNNAA, called the interferon-γ activation site or γ-activated sequence (GAS)(22Decker T. Lew D.J. Mirkovitch J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). In addition to interferon-γ, treating cells with GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-4 stimulates the binding of proteins to this GAS (23Lamb P. Kessler L.V. Suto C. Levy D.E. Seidil H.M. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Blood. 1994; 8: 2063-2071Crossref Google Scholar). Although a number of different STAT proteins have been cloned, most recently STAT4(24Yamahara K. Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B.L.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), and IL-4 STAT(26Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar), the STAT protein that mediates the effects of IL-3 and GM-CSF remains unknown. One approach to understanding the function of the Jak2 protein is to isolate the activation of this protein kinase from other growth factor-induced signals. To accomplish this task, we have made a fusion protein of the external domain of CD16, the transmembrane domain of CD7, and the complete coding sequence of Jak2. To obtain high levels of expression in hematopoietic cells, this fusion cDNA was encoded in a vaccinia virus. Our results demonstrate that cross-linking and activation of the membrane-bound Jak2 fusion protein mimic many of the biologic effects of the addition of hormone (IL-3 or GM-CSF), i.e. phosphorylation of multiple proteins, induction of mRNAs, and increases in STAT binding. Differences remain between the biologic activity of the fusion protein and that observed at the addition of hormone. In particular, unlike hormone, CD16/Jak2 fusion was unable to stimulate increases in c-myc, a mRNA that is essential for growth. A murine IL-3-dependent pro-B cell line, Ba/F3, was a gift from Dr. A. D'Andrea (Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute, Boston). The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium as a source of IL-3. WEHI-3B cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The human factor-dependent cell line MO7e was a gift from the Genetics Institute (Boston). These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, and 100 units/ml recombinant human (rh)-GM-CSF. Monoclonal anti-CD16 antibody 3G8 F(ab’)2 was purchased from Medarex, Inc. (Annandale, NJ). Rabbit anti-mouse IgG F(ab’)2 was obtained from Cappel (Durham, NC), and both the anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-PY) monoclonal antibody 4G10 and polyclonal antisera to Jak2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to Shc were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies were purchased from Amersham Corp. Antiserum against β chain was generated in our laboratory as described previously(16Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant vaccinia virus transfer vector, which contains CD16 extracellular domain joined to a short “stalk” segment of the transmembrane domain of CD7 and ZAP70 cDNA, was a gift from Dr. Brian Seed, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston. Polymerase chain reaction was used to create an MluI site in the appropriate reading frame in the 5’ end of the murine Jak2 cDNA (a gift from Dr. J. Ihle, St. Jude's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). A 3’ NotI site in the 3’-noncoding region of Jak2 cDNA was created by polymerase chain reaction allowing for ligation. ZAP70 cDNA was removed from the recombinant vector (27Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) by MluI/NotI digestion and replaced by Jak2 cDNA. The resulting tripartite fusion gene was introduced into 1 × 107 BSC-40 cells by electroporation (250 volts, 500 microfarads). The following day the cells were infected with wild type virus at a 0.5 multiplicity of infection. After a 24-h culture, the cells were harvested and lysed by freezing and thawing repeated three times. Recombinant vaccinia virus was selected first with guanine phosphoribosyltransferase selection followed by thymidine kinase selection as described(28Earl P.L. Moss B. Curr. Protocols Mol. Biol. 1991; 15 (suppl.) –: 16.17.1-16.17.16Google Scholar). The presence of the recombinant virus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction of infected cells. Approximately 1 × 107 Ba/F3 or MO7e cells were infected for 1 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with recombinant vaccinia virus at a multiplicity of infection of 100. After a 12-h incubation in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% calf serum and 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium or rh-GM-CSF, cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and starved for 4 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.5% albumin. Cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum at 107 cells/ml and incubated with 5 mg/ml anti-CD16 antibody F(ab’)2 for 2.5 min followed by incubation with 25 mg/ml anti-mouse IgG F(ab’)2 for the indicated times at 37°C. As a control, uninfected cells were starved at the same condition and stimulated with 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium or rh-GM-CSF. Approximately 107 cells were lysed at 4°C in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.02 M HEPES, pH 7.3, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was precleared by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min and then incubated with the indicated antibody for 2 h at 4°C. The immune complex was then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4°C, washed three times with lysis buffer, and then boiled for 5 min with 2 × Laemmli sample buffer. The proteins were electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (factor V, Sigma), the membrane was incubated with the appropriate primary antibody and washed three times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). After incubation with secondary antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase, the filter was washed with TBST three times, and immune reactive bands were visualized by the chemiluminescence system (DuPont NEN). In-gel MAP kinase assay was performed as described previously(20Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed, and total cellular proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE (12%) containing 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein. SDS was removed from the gel by shaking in 20% isopropyl alcohol in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, for 1 h followed by denaturation with 6 M guanidine HCl and renaturation in a 0.04% Tween 40-containing buffer. The gel was then incubated with kinase buffer containing 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 1 h. After washing the gel with 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1% sodium pyrophosphate solution, the gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. Northern blots were carried out as described previously(16Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty μg of total RNA was run on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred onto nylon membranes. The hybridization was carried out overnight at 42°C in solution containing 45% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate. Blots were washed with 2 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 20 min; 1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C for 20 min; and 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C for 20 min. The probe DNAs used in these experiments were described previously(16Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described(29Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). 1 × 107 cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended with hypotonic buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9; 20 mM NaF; 1 mM EDTA; 1 mM dithiothreitol; 1 mM Na3VO4; 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 mg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40. After incubation for 10 min on ice, nuclei were precipitated. Nuclear pellets were resuspended with high salt buffer which contained 420 mM NaCl and 20% glycerol in addition to the hypotonic buffer. After incubation for 20 min on ice, extracted proteins were separated from residual nuclei by centrifugation. The GAS oligonucleotide is based on an interferon GAS of the interferon regulatory factor-1 promoter and was formed by annealing oligonucleotides with the sequences GTCGAGATTTCCCCGAAATGA and TCGACTCATTCGGGGAAATC. The annealed oligonucleotides were labeled by filling in the overhanging ends with Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The EMSA was performed as described(23Lamb P. Kessler L.V. Suto C. Levy D.E. Seidil H.M. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Blood. 1994; 8: 2063-2071Crossref Google Scholar). Competitive inhibition experiments were performed with a 50-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotides. To examine the role of Jak2 in the signal transduction in the absence of IL-3 and GM-CSF, we constructed CD16/CD7/Jak2 (CD16/Jak2) fusion gene. The external domain of CD16 was fused to a short region of the CD7 molecule, which functions as a transmembrane domain to prevent receptor dimerization in the absence of cross-linking. To the CD16/CD7 fusion the entire Jak2 cDNA sequence was ligated, thus creating a transmembrane tyrosine kinase (Fig. 1A). To obtain high levels of expression of this protein in hematopoietic cells, this cDNA was incorporated into a recombinant vaccinia virus. Ba/F3 cells, a pro-B cell line dependent on IL-3 for growth, were infected with this recombinant vaccinia virus, and then 12 h later fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was accomplished using anti-CD16 antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. By this technique 80% of the cells were shown to express the CD16 antigen on their surfaces (Fig. 1B). To examine the production of CD16/Jak2 protein, Ba/F3 cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus, and cellular extracts were Western blotted with an antibody to Jak2. The Western blot demonstrated a 130-kDa endogenous Jak2 band and a 180-kDa CD16/Jak2 band which appeared after 5 h of infection and increased thereafter (Fig. 1C). At 24 h the levels of endogenous Jak2 and CD16/Jak2 were approximately equal (Fig. 1C). To determine whether clustering of CD16/Jak2 fusion proteins induces tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, Ba/F3 cells were infected with recombinant vaccinia virus. Ba/F3 cells were chosen for these studies because their growth depends on the addition of either IL-3 (WEHI-3B conditioned medium) or GM-CSF(16Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of growth factors to these cells has been shown to activate Jak2 protein kinases and stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of a specific set of proteins. Twelve hours after infection with the recombinant vaccinia virus, the Ba/F3 cells were treated, starved of both serum and IL-3 (conditioned medium) for 4 h, and then the CD16/Jak2 fusion proteins were clustered by cross-linking with anti-CD16 antibody followed by anti-mouse IgG. At specific times after the addition of cross-linker, Ba/F3 cells were lysed, and the presence of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western transfer and probing with an anti-PY antibody. Cross-linking of the CD16/Jak2 fusion stimulated the rapid phosphorylation of 220-, 200-, 145-, 120-, 97-, 67-, and 42-kDa proteins (Fig. 2). Phosphorylation of the majority of these proteins occurs rapidly and is evident within 2.5 min, persisting in most cases for greater than 60 min. A highly similar phosphorylation pattern is induced after the addition of WEHI-3B conditioned medium to the Ba/F3 cells. WEHI-3B conditioned medium induces the 145-, 97-, 67-, and 42-kDa proteins, whereas the 220-, 200-, and 120-kDa proteins are not seen. The time course of phosphorylation of these proteins differs between the cells containing the cross-linked fusion protein and those with the hormone treatment. For example the addition of WEHI-3B conditioned medium induced the phosphorylation of the 67-kDa protein within 15 min, whereas cross-linking of CD16/Jak2 fusion stimulated phosphorylation within 2.5 min. Thus, cross-linking of a transmembrane CD16/Jak2 fusion protein stimulates the phosphorylation of a set of proteins similar to those phosphorylated after the addition of growth factors to these cells. Previously, we and others (16Polotskaya A. Zhao Y. Lilly M. Kraft A.S. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 523-531PubMed Google Scholar, 17Okuda K. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Kanakura Y. Hallek M. Griffin J.D. Blood. 1992; 79: 2880-2887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the 42-kDa protein phosphorylated after GM-CSF or IL-3 treatment of Ba/F3 cells is MAP kinase (ERK2). To confirm that the 42-kDa protein tyrosine phosphorylated after CD16/Jak2 cross-linking is MAP kinase, we cross-linked the CD16/Jak2 expressed in Ba/F3 cells and did an anti-PY Western blot. This Western blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-Map kinase antibody. The addition of WEHI-3B conditioned medium induces a more slowly migrating form of MAP kinase in 5 min (Fig. 3B) which is still apparent by 30 min. Overlaying the anti-MAP kinase Western blot over the anti-PY blot demonstrates that the more slowly migrating band in the doublet is tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3, A and B). The cross-linking of CD16/Jak2 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase by 5 min. However, less MAP kinase is phosphorylated for a shorter time than after treatment with WEHI-3B conditioned medium. To confirm that MAP kinase activity was increased by cross-linking of CD16/Jak2 an in-gel protein kinase assay was performed using myelin basic protein as a substrate. Both WEHI-3B conditioned medium and cross-linking of CD16/Jak2 stimulated the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (Fig. 3C). However, the stimulation of protein kinase activity by WEHI-3B conditioned medium was greater than that seen after cross-linking. It is possible that the cross-linking of the CD16/Jak2 fusion mediates its effect on signal transduction pathways by stimulating either the phosphorylation of endogenous Jak2 or the β chain. It has been hypothesized that phosphorylation of the β chain could activate signal transduction by creating a binding site for SH2 domain-containing proteins. To exclude this possibility, both CD16/Jak2 and endogenous Jak2 were precipitated from Ba/F3 cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus using anti-Jak2 antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins was examined by anti-PY antibody Western blotting before and after cross-linking. The 180-kDa CD16/Jak2 fusion proteins were strongly tyrosine phosphorylated after cross-linking (Fig. 4A). No tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Jak2 was seen. After cross-linking, an unknown 200-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein coprecipitated with CD16/Jak2. Coprecipitation of this protein was also seen in MO7e cells (data not shown). In contrast, the addition of conditioned medium (IL-3) stimulated the phosphorylation of Jak2. Stripping this Western blot and reprobing with Jak2 antiserum demonstrated equivalent amounts of Jak2 in all lanes (data not shown). To examine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of β chain occurred after cross-linking of CD16/Jak2 in MO7e cells, a GM-CSF-dependent human cell line was infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus. This cell line was chosen for these experiments because of the availability in our laboratory of an immunoprecipitating antibody to the human β chain. As with previous experiments, after infection the cells were starved of growth factors for 4 h followed by cross-linking of the CD16/Jak2 fusion proteins. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-β antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-PY antibody. The addition of rh-GM-CSF to MO7e cells stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the 130-kDa β chain (Fig. 4B). However, cross- linking of CD16/Jak2 did not cause any effect on the phosphorylation of the β chain. To confirm that cross-linking stimulated phosphorylation, aliquots of cell lysates were also analyzed by Western blotting with anti-PY antibody. The appearance of additional phosphorylated bands after cross-linking demonstrates that CD16/Jak2 was active in these cells (data not shown). Thus, the CD16/Jak2 protein is capable of stimulating the phosphorylation of a wide range of proteins, but it does not cause the phosphorylation of either endogenous Jak2 or the β chain. Shc is an SH2 domain-containing protein that is tyrosine phosphorylated after stimulation of cells with a wide variety of cytokines, including GM-CSF and IL-3(30Damen J.E. Liu L. Cutler R.L.

Shc contains a Grb2 binding site, which enables it to interact with the Ras pathway and regulate activation of MAP kinase(15Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of the CD16/Jak2 fusion proteins in either Ba/F3 (Fig. 5, A and B) or MO7e cells (Fig. 5, C and D) induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of Shc followed by Western blotting with anti-PY. Stripping of this blot and probing with anti-Shc antibody demonstrate that equivalent amounts of Shc protein have been precipitated in both treated and untreated cells (Fig. 5). In Ba/F3 cells, Shc immunoprecipitation pulls down a tyrosine-phosphorylated 145-kDa protein. Recently it has been demonstrated that a tyrosine-phosphorylated 145-kDa protein binds to the amino terminus of Shc in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated cells(13Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). It is possible that the 145-kDa protein mediates the interaction between CD16/JAK2 and the Shc protein. Recently, a number of STAT proteins have been cloned(24Yamahara K. Quelle F.W. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B.L. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Silvennoinen O. Ih"
https://openalex.org/W2003642862,"PTPH1 is a human protein-tyrosine phosphatase with homology to the band 4.1 superfamily of cytoskeleton-associated proteins. Here, we report the purification and biochemical characterization of this enzyme from baculovirus-infected insect cells. The purified protein exhibited an apparent Mr of 120,000 on SDS gels. The native enzyme dephosphorylated both myelin basic protein (MBP) and reduced, carboxamidomethylated, and maleylated lysozyme (RCML) but was over 5-fold more active on MBP. The Km values for the two substrates were similar (1.45 μM for MBP and 1.6 μM for RCML). Phosphorylation of PTPH1 by protein kinase C in vitro resulted in a decrease in Km but had no effect on Vmax. Removal of the NH2-terminal band 4.1 homology domain of PTPH1 by limited trypsin cleavage stimulated dephosphorylation of RCML but inhibited its activity toward MBP. The dephosphorylation of RCML by full-length PTPH1 was enhanced up to 6-fold by unphosphorylated MBP and increasing ionic strength up to 0.2 M NaCl, whereas trypsinized preparations of PTPH1 containing the isolated catalytic domain were unaffected. These results suggest that in addition to a potential role in controlling subcellular localization, the NH2-terminal band 4.1 homology domain of PTPH1 may exert a direct effect on catalytic function."

INTRODUCTIONSeveral types of receptors central to the functioning of the immune system stimulate cellular responses when they are aggregated by ligand, directly or indirectly. Among the earliest observable responses to such aggregation is enhanced phosphorylation of tyrosines on one or more of the subunits of the receptor and on a variety of other proteins. In this respect, these receptors resemble many receptor kinases(1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4581) Google Scholar); however, unlike the latter, the multi-subunit immune response receptors (2Keegan A.D. Paul W.E. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 63-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have no known intrinsic kinase domains. Instead, there is increasing evidence that their action is mediated by constitutively bound and newly recruited kinases(3Pleiman C.M. D'Ambrosio D. Cambier J. Immunol.

As with other multi-subunit immune response receptors, increased phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on subunits of the receptor (β and γ in this instance) and on several other cellular proteins is among the earliest molecularly defined consequences of the aggregation of Fc∊RI(7Benhamou M.

A. 1992; 89: 9107-9111Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A fraction of Fc∊RI on RBL cells is associated with Lyn prior to activation, and additional Lyn is associated with the receptor after activation(13Jouvin M.-H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Syk appears not to be pre-associated with the receptor, but there is evidence that it associates with both the β and the γ subunits, primarily γ, following activation(13Jouvin M.-H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The relation between the degree of receptor aggregation and subsequent cellular events is often complex. For example, receptor aggregation is not always stimulatory but, depending on the concentration of ligand and receptor, can turn on or turn off cellular responses(16Dembo M. Goldstein B. Cell. 1980; 22: 59-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to understand the quantitative relationships between the aggregation of such receptors and the early biochemical signals they generate. To pursue these quantitative relationships, we chose an experimental system that is particularly tractable, both theoretically and experimentally. We used chemically cross-linked dimers of IgE to aggregate Fc∊RI on RBL cells. The only receptor aggregates that form in this case consist of two Fc∊RI, bound to the distinct IgE molecules in single IgE dimers. Because the dissociation of IgE from Fc∊RI is slow(17Kulczycki Jr., A. Metzger H. J. Exp. Med. 1974; 140: 1676-1695Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), receptor aggregates are long-lived. Excess monomeric IgE can be used to stop the formation of new aggregates without breaking up existing ones.Previously, we used such a protocol and found that receptors aggregated by oligomers continue to signal both early and late events for protracted periods(18Kent U.M. Mao S.-Y. Wofsy C. Goldstein B. Ross S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3087-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The early signal we monitored was phosphorylation of tyrosines on the receptor itself and on other proteins. Those studies also suggested that the stable aggregates undergo a dynamic process of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The goal of the present study was 2-fold. First, we wanted to determine the time course of receptor aggregation and compare it with the time course of phosphorylation of tyrosines on the receptor. Second, we wanted to see whether carefully quantitated results from similar experiments could be accounted for by a simple model in which the extent of phosphorylation was related to the extent of aggregation by a series of internally consistent rate constants. Aggregation of receptors is not readily assessed directly and must be inferred from binding studies. The use of dimeric rather than trimeric aggregates makes such inferences much more reliable, and so we principally used this type of oligomer for the present studies.DISCUSSIONPreviously, we showed that stable aggregates of Fc∊ receptors continue to signal RBL cell responses without the formation of new aggregates(18Kent U.M. Mao S.-Y. Wofsy C. Goldstein B. Ross S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3087-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The use of chemically cross-linked oligomers of IgE to induce receptor aggregation made the observation possible, since aggregation could be stopped (with monomeric IgE) without breaking up previously formed aggregates. This class of ligands has the further advantage that, since few states form, one can characterize the binding in detail and draw inferences about the time course of receptor aggregation. In this study, we used the simplest IgE oligomer, a dimer. We found that the response (phosphorylation) leveled off while the number of aggregates was still rising steeply. By comparing the observed time courses with predictions of a simple model, we could eliminate a number of possible explanations for the data. The surprising conclusion we are left with is that although the aggregates that form initially are effective and persistent signaling units, aggregates that form later are relatively ineffective.We first determined the kinetics with which dimers bound to the cells in the presence and absence of monomeric IgE. Analyzing the data within the framework of a model for the binding of IgE dimers to RBL cells, we determined binding and aggregation parameters and used them to predict the time course of the formation of dimerized Fc∊RI. The model (Fig. 1 and “Appendix”) is straightforward and gave close fits to the data (Fig. 2, 3). The results also indicate clearly that the concentration of IgE monomer used to block the binding of IgE dimers was effective.To investigate the relationship between the aggregation of Fc∊RI and the phosphorylation of tyrosines on the γ and β subunits of the receptor, we compared the predicted time course of receptor aggregation with the time course of phosphorylation of Fc∊RI (Fig. 4). The comparison showed that the kinetics of phosphorylation does not correspond with the rate of formation of the aggregates (Fig. 5); in particular, once formed, the stable aggregates show persistent activity. Initially, the time course of phosphorylation parallels quite closely the time course of the number of receptors in aggregates, but the comparison reveals a difference at later times (compare Fig. 2and Fig. 4). What was striking was that phosphorylation reached a plateau while aggregate formation continued. The shape of the phosphorylation curve when no monomeric IgE was present was similar to the shape of the phosphorylation curve when monomer was added after 2 min and the formation of new aggregates was blocked.To make quantitative comparisons between the predicted kinetics of aggregation and the experimentally determined kinetics of phosphorylation and to estimate the fraction of aggregated receptors that are phosphorylated, a mathematical description of the time course of phosphorylation is an essential tool. We therefore introduced a phenomenological model that allows for tyrosine phosphorylation and both reversible and irreversible (on the time scale of the experiments) dephosphorylation (Fig. 6). The role of this minimal model is to help identify the types of interactions of receptors, kinases, and phosphatases that are consistent with the data and those that can be rejected.The model depicted in Fig. 5is inconsistent with the experimental results, in that it cannot account simultaneously for apparent steady state levels of phosphotyrosine observed both in the absence and presence of new aggregate formation (i.e. in experiments with and without the addition of monomeric IgE). Parameters that account for the early plateau in levels of phosphotyrosine in the absence of monomer predict a rapid decay of phosphotyrosine after monomer is added, but no such decay is observed. Parameters consistent with the continued elevation of levels of phosphotyrosine after monomer is added predict that in the absence of monomer, phosphorylation of tyrosines should reach higher levels than those observed and should continue to rise over the hour period of our experiments. Again, this contrasts with our observations (Fig. 7).In rejecting the phenomenological model, we reject a wide array of potential phosphorylation/dephosphorylation schemes. The model has a constant rate of phosphorylation of non-phosphorylated receptor dimers and a constant rate of dephosphorylation of phosphorylated receptor dimers. A constant rate of phosphorylation is consistent with a pool of specific kinases that is not substantially depleted, either because the pool is large or because kinases remain active and interact with multiple receptor aggregates. Also consistent with the constant phosphorylation rate is a model where some or all of the receptors are stably associated with kinases that trans-phosphorylate adjacent receptors when dimers form(34Pribluda V.S. Pribluda C. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11246-11250Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Even if only a small fraction of Fc∊RI is associated with kinase, phosphorylation of receptor tyrosines should increase in proportion with the formation of additional aggregates. Constant recruitment of additional kinases to complexes of aggregated receptors and associated kinases is also consistent with the model and therefore cannot fully explain the data. A constant rate of dephosphorylation is consistent with an undepleted pool of phosphatases. If we invoke the activation or recruitment of phosphatases to explain why phosphorylation remains constant in the absence of monomer, despite continued aggregation, we would then predict the decay of phosphorylation in the presence of monomer, contrary to observation.Simple alternatives to the model do not correct the problems with fitting the data. In particular, we have shown that phosphorylation of tyrosines on the subunits of Fc∊RI does not appear to saturate under the conditions of our experiments (Fig. 8).One possibility we have not ruled out is that because of the dynamics of recruitment of kinases, aggregates that form “late” in the response are essentially left out of the response. This could occur, for example, if kinases that were pre-associated with receptors were capable of dissociating and binding to newly created phosphotyrosines on other proteins. Since Lyn kinase is only weakly associated with unaggregated receptors but is recruited to phosphorylated tyrosines on aggregated Fc∊RI(15Yamashita T. Mao S.-Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the creation of new high affinity binding sites that could compete for Lyn might reduce the number of pre-associated Lyn-receptor complexes available late in the response. If this were so, phosphorylation of β and γ would level off while aggregates continued to accumulate because such newly formed aggregates, lacking associated kinase, would be ineffective.Additional evidence that aggregates formed late in a response are less effective than aggregates formed initially comes from degranulation studies. We have observed that when RBL cell degranulation is induced by either dimeric 2C. Wofsy, U. M. Kent, S.-Y. Mao, H. Metzger, and B. Goldstein, unpublished observations. or trimeric (18Kent U.M. Mao S.-Y. Wofsy C. Goldstein B. Ross S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3087-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) oligomers of IgE, the kinetics of the response (secretion of hexosaminidase) is similar whether or not high concentrations of monomeric IgE are added shortly (2-3 min) after oligomer addition. For at least the first 30 min, the curves increase and tend to parallel each other. The addition of monomer reduces release but not to the extent that it reduces binding. That is, the additional aggregates that form late after the addition of oligomer appear to contribute less to the secretory response than those formed earlier.In closing, we wish to extend our previous discussion (18Kent U.M. Mao S.-Y. Wofsy C. Goldstein B. Ross S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3087-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) concerning how our results on persistent activity after cessation of aggregate formation can be reconciled with the apparently conflicting results of experiments in which aggregation of Fc∊RI was induced by highly multivalent antigens. In the latter studies, the cellular response (secretion) halted abruptly after the addition of competing monovalent hapten, even though receptor aggregation, as judged by persistence of cell-bound antigen, was not fully reversed(35MacGlashan Jr., D. Lichtenstein L.M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2330-2336PubMed Google Scholar, 36MacGlashan Jr., D. Mogowski M. Lichtenstein L.M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2337-2342PubMed Google Scholar, 37Seagrave J.-C.

Inflamm. 1990; 1: 173-197Crossref Google Scholar). The degree of persistence of bound antigen depended on the time between the addition of antigen and the addition of hapten. The longer the delay, the greater the fraction of antigen that became resistant to dissociation(37Seagrave J.-C. Deanin G.G. Martin J.C. Davis B.H. Oliver J.M. Cytometry. 1987; 8: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).The molecular basis for the dissociation-resistant state is not known. The resistant state is not due to an induced change in the affinity of IgE for an antigenic site since the aggregation of IgE-Fc∊RI does not alter the affinity of IgE for monovalent ligand(39Posner R.G. Lee B. Conrad D.H. Holowka D. Baird B. Goldstein B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5350-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The aggregation of three or more Fc receptors does lead to the immobilization of Fc∊RI (40Menon A.K. Holowka D. Webb W.W. Baird B. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and, at supraoptimal antigen concentrations, to interaction of the receptor with the detergent-resistant cell skeleton (41Robertson D. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4565-4572PubMed Google Scholar, 42Labrecque G.F. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 236-243PubMed Google Scholar, 43Apgar J.R. J.

Kochan J. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). An immobilized IgE cannot diffuse away from an antigen when it dissociates. If the antigen is bound to two or more immobile IgEs, its motion is also restricted when one of the bound IgEs dissociates. Consequently, immobilization of the receptors may enhance the interaction of their bound IgE with the antigen, thus reducing the hapten's ability to break up aggregates effectively.That the dissociation-resistant aggregates no longer signal suggests that the receptors in such aggregates have been specifically desensitized(46Sobotka A.K. Dembo M. Goldstein B. Lichtenstein L.M. J. Immunol. 1979; 122: 511-517PubMed Google Scholar, 47Fewtrell C. Rubin R.P. Weiss G.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Calcium in Biological Systems.

In turn, this has been interpreted to indicate that signal transduction is short lived; that to maintain signaling, new aggregates must constantly be made, and that cellular responses are proportional to the rate of formation of aggregates rather than to the number of such clustered receptors. This interpretation is not consistent with our result or previous results (49Dembo M. Kagey-Sobotka A. Lichtenstein L.M. Goldstein B. Mol. Immunol. 1982; 19: 421-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) on persistent signaling by dimers and trimers of IgE.One way to reconcile the results in the two systems is to postulate that the rate of desensitization differs markedly from one system to the other(18Kent U.M. Mao S.-Y. Wofsy C. Goldstein B. Ross S. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3087-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, there is an interpretation of the experiments with multivalent antigen that is consistent with the oligomer results and that does not depend on postulating differences between the systems. The new interpretation we propose is that desensitization is a slow process, that desensitized receptors become immobile, and that because of the rebinding effects discussed above, only a small number of desensitized, immobilized receptors is needed to keep some of the bound antigen on the cell surface after hapten addition. Since only desensitized receptors remain aggregated, signal transduction ceases. In the oligomer experiments, signaling persists because both active and inactive receptors remain aggregated.

Today. 1992; 13: 63-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have no known intrinsic kinase domains. Instead, there is increasing evidence that their action is mediated by constitutively bound and newly recruited kinases(3Pleiman C.M. D'Ambrosio D. Cambier J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 393-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 4Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). In basophils and mast cells, aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc∊RI) stimulates morphological, secretory, and biosynthetic changes in the cells(5Oliver J.M. Seagrave J.-C. Stump R.F. Pfeiffer J.R. Deanin G.G. Prog. Allergy. 1988; 42: 185-245PubMed Google Scholar, 6Metzger H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1477-1487PubMed Google Scholar). As with other multi-subunit immune response receptors, increased phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on subunits of the receptor (β and γ in this instance) and on several other cellular proteins is among the earliest molecularly defined consequences of the aggregation of Fc∊RI(7Benhamou M.

Thus, their local expression in the CNS of transgenic mice could be used to perturb the function of the corresponding antigen. As a first application of this approach, we have generated transgenic mice that express antibodies against the neuropeptide substance P, under the transcriptional control of the promoter of the neuronal gene vgf. The transgenic antibodies are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner and are effective in competing with the endogenous substance P, as demonstrated by a marked inhibition of neurogenic inflammation and by motor deficits. This phenotypic knockout approach may provide a complementary alternative to gene knockout by homologous recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2020534255,"We tried to detect minimal stimulation-induced glutamate overflow from the surface of a hippocampal slice using an outside-out patch electrode excised from pyramidal cell membranes. The amplitude of the stimulation-induced patch current was dependent on the distance between the slice surface and the tip of patch sensor. The current-voltage relations of the stimulation-induced patch current were similar to those of the current evoked puff by application of L-glutamate to the patch. This indicates that the stimulation-induced patch current was produced by glutamate released from presynaptic terminals, and thus this technique may be useful in the study of transmitter release evoked by minimal electrical stimulation in brain slices."
https://openalex.org/W2002200554,"Antisense technology has been widely used for regulating gene expression. Single-stranded RNA or DNA complementary to a target mRNA can inhibit the translation of the mRNA. Antisense RNA is produced in vivo, while antisense DNA is chemically synthesized as an oligonucleotide, which is extracellularly added to the cells. To maintain the effect of antisense DNA, a synthetic oligonucleotide has to be constantly added to the system. An advantage of antisense DNA over antisense RNA is that the target mRNA hybridized with the antisense DNA can be specifically digested by ribonuclease H. Here, we attempted to produce in vivo short single-stranded DNAs complementary to a specific mRNA. We demonstrate that such antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide of a desired sequence can be produced in Escherichia coli using a retron, a bacterial retroelement, as a vector and that the antisense DNA thus produced in vivo can effectively inhibit the expression of a specific E. coli gene, such as the gene for the major outer membrane lipoprotein.

https://openalex.org/W2094503097,"Cholera toxin and the related Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin are hexameric proteins comprising one A-subunit and five B-subunits. In this paper we report the generation and characterization of a monoclonal antibody, designated LDS47, that recognizes and precipitates in vivo assembly intermediates of the B-subunit (EtxB) of E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin. The monoclonal antibody is unable to precipitate native B-subunit pentamers, thus making LDS47 a useful probe for studying the early stages of enterotoxin biogenesis. The use of LDS47 to monitor the in vivo turnover of newly synthesized B-subunits in the periplasm of E. coli demonstrated that (i) the turnover of unassembled B-subunits followed an apparent first order process and (ii) it occurred concomitantly with the assembly of native B-pentamers (k = 0.317 +/- 0.170 min-1; t1/2 = 2.2 min). No other proteins were co-precipitated with the newly synthesized B-subunits; a finding that implies that unassembled B-subunits do not stably associate with other periplasmic proteins prior to their assembly into a macromolecular complex. The use of overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to the entire EtxB polypeptide demonstrated that the epitope recognized by LDS47 is located within the amino-terminal decapeptide of the B-subunit. From the x-ray structural analysis of the toxin (Sixma, T., Kalk, K., van Zanten, B., Dauter, Z., Kingma, J., Witholt, B., and Hol, W. G. J. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 230, 890-918), this region appears to resemble a curved finger that clasps the adjacent B-subunit. Thus, this region might be expected to be exposed in the unfolded or unassembled subunit, but to become partially buried upon assembly and thus inaccessible to recognition by the monoclonal antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1597770711,"The location of biologically relevant epitopes on human tumor necrosis factor alpha (hTNF-alpha) was evaluated by testing the immunoreactivity of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies against 149 sequential, overlapping octamer peptides. A goat polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant hTNF-alpha, which neutralizes hTNF-alpha biological activities, reacted with oligopeptides corresponding to hTNF-alpha residues 7-11, 17-23, 30-39, 42-49, 106-112, and 135-142. A possible assembled epitopic region (residues 25, 27, and 144) for neutralizing murine monoclonal antibodies designated 11D7G4 and 9C4G5 was deduced from the fact that they bound to tripeptides, mimicking a discontinuous epitope. These antigenic regions wer found to include of adjoin poorly conserved amino acids and they were located in the turns between beta-sheets on the surface of the molecule. Three of the sequential epitopic regions and an assembled region were closely related to the receptor binding sites proposed in several other studies. These antibodies appear to neutralize TNF-alpha activities by directly masking receptor binding sites."
