https://openalex.org/W2151698573,"Mitochondria are highly mobile and dynamic organelles that continually fuse and divide. These processes allow mitochondria to exchange contents, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Here we examine the functions of mitochondrial fusion in differentiated skeletal muscle through conditional deletion of the mitofusins Mfn1 and Mfn2, mitochondrial GTPases essential for fusion. Loss of the mitofusins causes severe mitochondrial dysfunction, compensatory mitochondrial proliferation, and muscle atrophy. Mutant mice have severe mtDNA depletion in muscle that precedes physiological abnormalities. Moreover, the mitochondrial genomes of the mutant muscle rapidly accumulate point mutations and deletions. In a related experiment, we find that disruption of mitochondrial fusion strongly increases mitochondrial dysfunction and lethality in a mouse model with high levels of mtDNA mutations. With its dual function in safeguarding mtDNA integrity and preserving mtDNA function in the face of mutations, mitochondrial fusion is likely to be a protective factor in human disorders associated with mtDNA mutations."

Strong evidence suggests that rare mutations of severe effect are responsible for a substantial portion of complex human disease. Evolutionary forces generate vast genetic heterogeneity in human illness by introducing many new variants in each generation. Current sequencing technologies offer the possibility of finding rare disease-causing mutations and the genes that harbor them. “Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,” wrote Tolstoy in Anna Karenina. Tolstoy was reflecting on the individually unique nature of human tragedy. We suggest that this principle also captures the misfortune of human disease. That is, from the perspective of genetics, we suggest that complex human disease is in fact a large collection of individually rare, even private, conditions. Disentangling the paradoxes embedded in this idea will be the subject of this Essay. In molecular terms, we suggest that human disease is characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity, far greater than previously appreciated. Converging evidence for a wide range of common diseases indicates that heterogeneity is important at multiple levels of causation: (1) individually rare mutations collectively play a substantial role in causing complex illnesses; (2) the same gene may harbor many (hundreds or even thousands) different rare severe mutations in unrelated affected individuals; (3) the same mutation may lead to different clinical manifestations (phenotypes) in different individuals; and (4) mutations in different genes in the same or related pathways may lead to the same disorder. This degree of allelic, locus, and phenotypic heterogeneity has important implications for gene discovery. In particular, causality in this context can almost never be resolved by large-scale association or case-control studies. This degree of heterogeneity also has important implications for development of molecular treatments and their appropriate use by individual patients. The genetic bases of disease in modern humans reflect the architecture and evolution of the human genome. The oldest human alleles originated in Africa, in parallel with the development of our species, millions of years before people first migrated out of Africa 50,000 to 60,000 years ago (Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1994Cavalli-Sforza L.L. Menozzi P. Piazza A. History and Geography of Human Genes. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ1994Google Scholar, Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 2003Cavalli-Sforza L.L. Feldman M.W. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A ). These ancient polymorphisms are shared by all human populations and account for approximately 90% of human variation. These polymorphisms provided the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the HapMap (Tishkoff and Verrelli, 2003Tishkoff S.A. Verrelli B.C. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2003; 4: 293-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, The International HapMap Consortium, 2007The International HapMap ConsortiumNature. 2007; 449: 851-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3376) Google Scholar). Yet new alleles constantly arise, at an estimated rate of approximately 175 per diploid human genome per generation (Nachman and Crowell, 2000Nachman M.W. Crowell S.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 297-304PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). Exponential population growth, fueled by the development of agriculture in the past 10,000 years and of urbanization in the past 700 years, has resulted in a vast number of new alleles. Collectively, these alleles have generated an immense degree of genetic variation. Given the size of the present day human population, every point mutation compatible with life is likely present in someone, somewhere. Many of these rare alleles are found in only one person or family. Thus the paradox: most human variation is ancient and shared, but most alleles are recent and rare. Whole-genome sequencing efforts have revealed millions of previously unreported variants in healthy individuals, including single base pair substitutions, small insertions and deletions, and larger copy number mutations (McKernan et al., 2009McKernan K.J. Peckham H.E. Costa G.L. McLaughlin S.F. Fu Y. Tsung E.F. Clouser C.R. Duncan C. Ichikawa J.K. Lee C.C. et al.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1527-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Most of these mutations likely have no functional significance and persist by chance in the absence of selective pressure. In contrast, mutations with deleterious effects, either on viability before reproduction or on fertility, are less frequently transmitted to subsequent generations. By this reasoning, it should be no surprise that severe mutations associated with early-onset disease are disproportionately of recent origin and are therefore individually very rare. Rare large-effect mutations are now recognized as causes of many different common medical conditions. A thorough review of the rare variant literature for human disease is well beyond the scope of this commentary. Here we briefly consider a few very different complex disorders for which rare mutations have been implicated, drawing in part from our own research. Rare severe alleles have been implicated in all forms of inherited susceptibility to cancer. Inherited predisposition to breast cancer is associated with germline mutations in at least 13 genes (Walsh and King, 2007Walsh T. King M.-C. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 103-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A ). Thousands of different loss-of-function mutations have been detected in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (Figure 2B); all of these mutations are individually rare, and each independently confers very high risks for breast and ovarian cancers. Rare germline mutations in p53, PTEN, CHEK2, PALB2, ATM, BRIP1, CDH1, and STK1 are also associated with increased risk of breast cancer, ranging from 2-fold for CHEK2 to 10-fold for p53. Each of these genes operates in networks integral to DNA repair and genomic integrity. For each gene, the combination of inherited and somatic loss-of-function mutations (“2 hits”) leads to errors of DNA repair and ultimately to tumor development. In addition, biallelic germline loss-of-function mutations in BRCA2, BRIP1, and PALB2 cause various forms of Fanconi Anemia, all of which are characterized by genomic instability and early-onset cancers. (A) Thus far, 13 genes have been identified that harbor loss-of-function mutations responsible for inherited susceptibility to human breast cancer. Each susceptible woman carries an inherited mutation in only one (or very occasionally, two) of these genes. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most frequently altered of these genes. Inherited mutations in TP53 and PTEN are fortunately very rare and lead to young onset breast cancer in the context of Li-Fraumeni syndrome and Cowden disease, respectively. Most of the genes illustrated encode proteins critical to the maintenance of genomic integrity. The large number of high-incidence breast cancer families with no mutations in any of these genes suggests that additional genes remain to be found. (B) At BRCA1, more than 1000 different alleles increase susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers. The figure shows positions of frameshift and nonsense mutations along the BRCA1 gene, which is in blue, with exons indicated. Among mutation carriers, cancer development is caused by the combination of the inherited mutation and a subsequent somatic mutation, leading to complete loss of BRCA1 function in the affected tissue. Genetic heterogeneity of inherited predisposition to breast cancer serves as a model for other complex illnesses. The disorder results from any one of thousands of different mutations in any one of multiple different genes, but all the implicated genes encode proteins in related pathways (Walsh and King, 2007Walsh T. King M.-C. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 103-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We suggest that the degree of biological complexity underlying a phenotype is an excellent predictor of locus heterogeneity. We further suggest that age at onset and severity of the illness are excellent predictors of allelic heterogeneity at each locus. Dozens of genes harbor inherited mutations leading to nonsyndromic hearing loss, and each gene harbors multiple pathogenic mutations (Dror and Avraham, 2009Dror A.A. Avraham K.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 411-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Depending on the gene and mutation, inheritance of the hearing loss may be dominant or recessive and autosomal, X-linked, or mitochondrial. All deafness-causing mutations are recent and all but one are individually rare. The one frequent mutation, 30 delG in connexin 26, is the exception that proves the rule: it is not a common shared ancestral variant but rather has occurred independently multiple times in a mutational hotspot. Genes responsible for hearing loss encode proteins involved in a wide variety of biological processes in the inner ear, including development and maintenance of cytoskeletal structures, myosin motors, gap junction transport and signaling, ion channels, and transcriptional regulators (Figure 3). Mutations in microRNA have also been identified in hearing loss. The theme is the same as for inherited predisposition to cancer: any one of many different mutations in any one of many different genes lead to related phenotypes. Thus far, 48 genes have been identified that harbor mutations responsible for inherited hearing loss. The genes encode proteins for a wide range of functions in the inner ear: hair bundle morphogenesis, including cytoskeleton, adhesion, scaffolding, and motor proteins (red); ion homeostasis, including connexins, ion channels, and tight junctions (blue); extracellular matrix proteins (green), transcription factors (orange), and proteins whose function in hearing is not yet known (black). Every gene includes multiple deafness-associated mutations. GJB2, which encodes a gap junction protein, is the most frequently altered of these genes, although all mutations are individually rare. Each affected individual carries one dominant or two recessive mutations in only one gene. Individually rare variants in genes related to lipid metabolism are associated with extreme levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (Cohen et al., 2004Cohen J.C. Kiss R.S. Pertsemlidis A. Marcel Y.L. McPherson R. Hobbs H.H. Science. 2004; 305: 869-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (Cohen et al., 2006Cohen J.C. Pertsemlidis A. Fahmi S. Esmail S. Vega G.L. Grundy S.M. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 1810-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Although each variant only explains a small number of cases, collectively these mutations are responsible for a substantial portion of metabolic disease. The design for identifying these alleles was ingenious: candidate genes, defined as those causing rare recessive metabolic disorders, were sequenced in genomic DNA of individuals without overt disease but with extreme values of the trait of interest, i.e., levels of HDL or LDL cholesterol. This proved a powerful and efficient strategy for discovering causal variants associated with complex genetic traits (Fahmi et al., 2008Fahmi S. Yang C. Esmail S. Hobbs H.H. Cohen J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 2101-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Emerging research suggests that rare mutations play important roles in neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism and schizophrenia (Figure 4). A substantial portion of autism appears to be caused by rare point mutations, deletions, duplications, and larger chromosomal abnormalities (Bucan et al., 2009Bucan M. Abrahams B.S. Wang K. Glessner J.T. Herman E.I. Sonnenblick L.I. Alvarez Retuerto A.I. Imielinski M. Hadley D. Bradfield J.P. et al.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Autism is characterized by rare structural mutations, including a disproportionately high rate of de novo large (>100 kb) deletions and duplications (Sebat et al., 2007Sebat J. Lakshmi B. Malhotra D. Troge J. Lese-Martin C. Walsh T. Yamrom B. Yoon S. Krasnitz A. Kendall J. et al.Science. 2007; 316: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). Large structural mutations that reoccur independently multiple times in genomic “hotspots,” including on chromosomes 1q21.1, 15q11-q13, 16p11.2, and 22q11.21, may each explain small subsets of cases (Bucan et al., 2009Bucan M. Abrahams B.S. Wang K. Glessner J.T. Herman E.I. Sonnenblick L.I. Alvarez Retuerto A.I. Imielinski M. Hadley D. Bradfield J.P. et al.PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000536Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Copy number mutations in patients with autism may disproportionally disrupt genes involved with neuronal cell-adhesion or ubiquitin degradation, both important networks for brain development (Glessner et al., 2009Glessner J.T. Wang K. Cai G. Korvatska O. Kim C.E. Wood S. Zhang H. Estes A. Brune C.W. Bradfield J.P. et al.Nature. 2009; 459: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). In addition, rare severe mutations in multiple genes important for brain development, including NRXN1, CNTN4, CNTNAP2, NLGN4, DPP10, and SHANK3, have been identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (Guilmatre et al., 2009Guilmatre A. Dubourg C. Mosca A.L. Legallic S. Goldenberg A. Drouin-Garraud V. Layet V. Rosier A. Briault S. Bonnet-Brilhault F. et al.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2009; 66: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Recent genomic analyses have revealed many individually rare, or even de novo, micro-deletions, micro-duplications, and point mutations associated with schizophrenia (red), autism (blue), or both (black). The most frequently replicated genes and loci include DISC1, NRXN1 (neurexin), CNTNAP2, and SHANK3, as well as genomic hotspots at 1q21.1, 15q13.3, 16p11.2, and 22q11.2. Similar results have been observed for schizophrenia. We found that compared to healthy controls, individuals with schizophrenia were 3-fold more likely to harbor rare structural genomic mutations that impacted genes (Walsh et al., 2008Walsh T. McClellan J.M. McCarthy S.E. Addington A.M. Pierce S.B. Cooper G.M. Nord A.S. Kusenda M. Malhotra D. Bhandari A. et al.Science. 2008; 320: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The risk was even higher in subjects with early onset of schizophrenia. Each rare mutation disrupted a different gene or genes. However, the disrupted genes were not a random sample of the genome. Genes disrupted in patients were disproportionally involved with signaling and neurodevelopment (e.g., neuregulin and glutamate pathways), whereas genes disrupted in controls did not cluster in any particular pathways. Several independent studies have replicated and extended our findings. Compared to controls, individuals with schizophrenia carried significantly more de novo structural mutations (Xu et al., 2008Xu B. Roos J.L. Levy S. van Rensburg E.J. Gogos J.A. Karayiorgou M. Nat. Genet. 2008; 40: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) and more structural mutations at genomic hotspots, including chromosomes 1q21.1, 15q13.3, 16p13.1, and 22q11.2 (Stefansson et al., 2008Stefansson H. Rujescu D. Cichon S. Pietiläinen O.P. Ingason A. Steinberg S. Fossdal R. Sigurdsson E. Sigmundsson T. Buizer-Voskamp J.E. et al.Nature. 2008; 455: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar, International Schizophrenia Consortium, 2008International Schizophrenia ConsortiumNature. 2008; 455: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a substantial portion of autism and schizophrenia is caused by individually rare mutations—small and large—that disrupt the function of genes operating in critical neurodevelopmental pathways. Several genomic hotspots have been implicated in more than one psychiatric or neurocognitive phenotype (Cook and Scherer, 2008Cook Jr., E.H. Scherer S.W. Nature. 2008; 455: 919-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The converse is also true: the same mutation may be associated with different psychiatric disorders or with no illness at all. For example, in the Scottish kindred harboring a chromosomal translocation disrupting DISC1, 29 translocation carriers presented variously with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, or no mental illness (Chubb et al., 2008Chubb J.E. Bradshaw N.J. Soares D.C. Porteous D.J. Millar J.K. Mol. Psychiatry. 2008; 13: 36-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Similarly, there are several genes, including NRXN1, PRODH, DOC2A, and CNTNAP2, for which rare deleterious mutations have been detected in individuals with autism, mental retardation, and schizophrenia (Guilmatre et al., 2009Guilmatre A. Dubourg C. Mosca A.L. Legallic S. Goldenberg A. Drouin-Garraud V. Layet V. Rosier A. Briault S. Bonnet-Brilhault F. et al.Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2009; 66: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, mutations in genes involved with brain development may lead to a wide range of pleiotropic effects. Conversely, each neuropsychiatric outcome may be influenced by a variety of interacting factors, including dose and timing of gene expression, epistasis, RNA regulatory elements, epigenetic effects, and environmental exposures. In principle, there are thousands of candidate genes for these illnesses, given that most human genes are expressed in brain. Many more genes responsible for neurological and psychiatric disorders will be identified as sequencing technologies improve and the cost of screening individual genomes falls. Characterization of the functional consequences of these mutations will help to elucidate both normal brain development and neurodevelopmental processes leading to disease (Geschwind, 2008Geschwind D.H. Cell. 2008; 135: 391-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The recognition that rare alleles are important contributors to common complex human diseases is a major paradigm shift in human genetics. In the past decade, until this shift, the search for disease-associated genes has been predicated almost entirely on the common disease-common variant model, which postulates that common illnesses stem from the additive or multiplicative effects of combinations of common variants (Risch and Merikangas, 1996Risch N. Merikangas K. Science. 1996; 273: 1516-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). In this model, each “risk variant” is postulated to confer only a small degree of risk, with no one variant sufficient to cause the disorder. Disease onset is postulated as the result of the combined effects of many such alleles. The model dates to Francis Galton, 1872Galton F. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 1872; 20: 394-402Crossref Google Scholar and early population genetics theory (Fisher, 1918Fisher R.A. Trans. R. Soc. Edinb. 1918; 52: 399-433Crossref Scopus (2291) Google Scholar, Wright, 1934Wright S. Genetics. 1934; 19: 537-551PubMed Google Scholar, Falconer, 1965Falconer D.S. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1965; 29: 51-76Crossref Scopus (1022) Google Scholar) and with recent technology could be tested directly. For each common disease, “risk variants” have been identified by comparing allele frequencies at hundreds of thousands of polymorphic sites (SNPs) in thousands of cases versus thousands of controls. To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have published hundreds of common variants whose allele frequencies are statistically correlated with various illnesses and traits. However, the vast majority of such variants have no established biological relevance to disease or clinical utility for prognosis or treatment. For example, a recently published 12 year follow-up study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in more than 19,000 women found that the 101 SNPs identified by GWAS as risk variants for CVD did not predict cardiovascular outcomes (Paynter et al., 2010Paynter N.P. Chasman D.I. Paré G. Buring J.E. Cook N.R. Miletich J.P. Ridker P.M. JAMA. 2010; 303: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). More generally, it is now clear that common risk variants fail to explain the vast majority of genetic heritability for any human disease, either individually or collectively (Manolio et al., 2009Manolio T.A. Collins F.S. Cox N.J. Goldstein D.B. Hindorff L.A. Hunter D.J. McCarthy M.I. Ramos E.M. Cardon L.R. Chakravarti A. et al.Nature. 2009; 461: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (5379) Google Scholar). Do common variants ever make a major contribution to disease? Of course. Sickle cell anemia and the thalassemias are caused by multiple mutations in hemoglobin genes that persist at polymorphic frequencies in malarial endemic regions worldwide (Patrinos et al., 2005Patrinos G.P. Kollia P. Papadakis M.N. Hum. Mutat. 2005; 26: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Autoimmune conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosis, multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis, are strongly influenced by common polymorphic variation at the histocompatibility (MHC) loci (Fernando et al., 2008Fernando M.M. Stevens C.R. Walsh E.C. DeJager P.L. Goyette P. Plenge R.M. Vyse T.J. Rioux J.D. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000024Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Alzheimer's disease is strongly influenced by an allele of APOE4 that occurs at polymorphic frequencies in most populations (Bird, 2005Bird T.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 862-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Lactose intolerance (or lactase persistence) is caused by the effect of any one of several different alleles in noncoding enhancers of the lactase promoter; different regulatory alleles are common in different populations (Tishkoff et al., 2007Tishkoff S.A. Reed F.A. Ranciaro A. Voight B.F. Babbitt C.C. Silverman J.S. Powell K. Mortensen H.M. Hirbo J.B. Osman M. et al.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Pharmacogenomics holds immediate promise for personalized medicine, for example by genotyping CYP2C9 and VKORC1 to improve the safety of warfarin (Gurwitz and Motulsky, 2007Gurwitz D. Motulsky A.G. Pharmacogenomics. 2007; 8: 1479-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These traits and the common alleles influencing them illustrate two important points. First, each common risk variant leads to a demonstrable functional difference in the protein it encodes or regulates. In contrast, the majority of variants detected by GWAS have no demonstrated biological significance. Second, the persistence of these common alleles reflects evolutionary forces: deleterious alleles in hemoglobins were maintained by selection for heterozygotes driven by malaria (sickle cell anemia and the thalassemias); geographic-specific variation in immune response is protective against geographic-specific infection (autoimmune conditions); the illness has no effect on fitness because it appears well after reproductive life (Alzheimer's disease); a medication introduces a new environmental challenge not previously under evolutionary pressure (drug response). The genetic architecture of a disorder, i.e., the number and frequency of susceptibility alleles, is shaped by evolutionary factors, including the impact of the illness on selection (Pritchard and Cox, 2002Pritchard J.K. Cox N.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2417-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In order to be maintained at polymorphic frequencies worldwide, common variants with even modest influence on disease must withstand selective pressure in every generation. Not surprisingly, therefore, the common alleles with the best documented relationship to disease are associated with disorders that arise later in life, i.e., Alzheimer disease's or age-related macular degeneration. For illnesses that impact reproductive fitness, balancing positive selection is often demonstrable. Illness in these cases may arise from interaction between genetic and environmental factors, such that an otherwise adaptive mechanism or trait is deleterious in certain individuals. For example, adaptive inflammatory responses can cause autoimmune disorders when turned against the host, or efficient storage of calories can lead to type II diabetes or to obesity in food-rich cultures. Both common and rare alleles may lead to the same disease. For example, multiple rare mutations in any one of several genes (e.g., APP, PS1, PS2, and UBQLN1) lead to early-onset Alzheimer's disease (Bird, 2005Bird T.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 862-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Rare mutations in genes involved in immune response (e.g., DNASEI, TREX1) confer a very high risk for lupus (Moser et al., 2009Moser K.L. Kelly J.A. Lessard C.J. Harley J.B. Genes Immun. 2009; 10: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Each of these conditions is characterized by allele and locus heterogeneity. However, it should not be anticipated that all complex diseases will have substantial contributions from common risk variants. This is especially true for illnesses that reduce fertility, either biologically or through social selection against marriage with individuals with severe diseases. Alleles of significant effect must be enabled by evolutionary forces to persist at polymorphic frequencies. It has become commonplace in the genetics community to aver that genome-wide association studies have led to the identification of hundreds of SNPs as “risk variants” for common diseases, while acknowledging that most of the heritability for these traits remains to be explained (Manolio et al., 2009Manolio T.A. Collins F.S. Cox N.J. Goldstein D.B. Hindorff L.A. Hunter D.J. McCarthy M.I. Ramos E.M. Cardon L.R. Chakravarti A. et al.Nature. 2009; 461: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (5379) Google Scholar). We agree with this conclusion: that most of the inherited basis of common traits remains to be explained (Goldstein, 2009Goldstein D.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 360: 1696-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). We further suggest that many GWAS findings stem from factors other than a true association with disease risk. The bases of our concern are both statistical and experimental. A major limitation complicating genome-wide association studies is the potential for cryptic population stratification. Subtle differences in ancestry between cases and controls can produce spurious association solely due to sampling. GWAS study designs typically control for population structure in two ways: by taking into account differences among populations in average allele frequencies and by excluding individual subjects with extreme outlier genotypes (e.g., Price et al., 2006Price A.L. Patterson N.J. Plenge R.M. Weinblatt M.E. Shadick N.A. Reich D. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (6180) Google Scholar, Purcell et al., 2007Purcell S. Neale B. Todd-Brown K. Thomas L. Ferreira M.A. Bender D. Maller J. Sklar P. de Bakker P.I. Daly M.J. Sham P.C. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 81: 559-575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16842) Google Scholar). These approaches are appropriate and necessary but not sufficient. Neither adjustment addresses the problem posed by individual SNPs that are outliers with respect to variation in allele frequencies among healthy populations. A hypervariable SNP may be falsely identified as a risk variant if cases and controls are not perfectly matched. Stratifying cases and controls by self-reported ethnicity is not nearly sufficient to control for this problem (Serre et al., 2008Serre D. Montpetit A. Paré G. Engert J.C. Yusuf S. Keavney B. Hudson T.J. Anand S. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A recently published genome-wide association study of autism (Wang et al., 2009Wang K. Zhang H. Ma D. Bucan M. Glessner J.T. Abrahams B.S. Salyakina D. Imielinski M. Bradfield J.P. Sleiman P.M. et al.Nature. 2009; 459: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) provides a particularly dramatic example of the perils of cryptic population stratification. The SNP most significantly associated with the illness was rs4307059 on chromosome 5p14.1. The ancestral T allele of rs4307059 was identified as the “risk variant,” with allele frequencies in the discovery series of 0.65 among cases and 0.61 among controls (odds ratio = 1.19, p = 3.4 × 10−8). All cases and controls were of European ancestry. The p value is compelling. However, the frequency of the proposed “risk variant” varies from 0.21 to 0.77 across European populations (Coop et al., 2009Coop G. Pickrell J.K. Novembre J. Kudaravalli S. Li J. Absher D. Myers R.M. Cavalli-Sforza L.L. Feldman M.W. Pritchard J.K. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000500Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), a range 14-fold greater than the difference in allele frequencies between cases and controls. Even a subtle difference in the ancestries of cases and controls within Europe could explain the difference in allele frequencies that was attributed to the autism phenotype. An odds ratio of 3.0, or even of 2.0 depending on population allele frequencies, would be robust to such population stratification. However, odds ratios of the magnitude generally detected by GWAS (<1.5) can frequently be explained by cryptic population stratification, regardless of the p value associated with them. The variation in allele frequencies at rs4307059 is particularly striking worldwide: in virtually all African populati"

However, the contributions of coding sequences to the efficiency of the process remain unclear. Here, we identify a universally conserved profile of translation efficiency along mRNAs computed based on adaptation between coding sequences and the tRNA pool. In this profile, the first ∼30–50 codons are, on average, translated with a low efficiency. Additionally, in eukaryotes, the last ∼50 codons show the highest efficiency over the full coding sequence.

We suggest that the slow “ramp” at the beginning of mRNAs serves as a late stage of translation initiation, forming an optimal and robust means to reduce ribosomal traffic jams, thus minimizing the cost of protein expression. The efficiency of translation is universally lower across the first ∼50 codons Evolutionary forces act to maintain this profile of translation elongation speed The profile is predictive of ribosome density for translation of yeast genes The ramp in efficiency may contribute to fitness and managing the cost of translation mRNA translation is controlled at multiple stages and by diverse mechanisms. A major part of the control occurs at the stage of initiation, where ribosomes are recruited to and assembled on the mRNA, typically on the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T.

Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar). The elongation phase is governed by both the mRNA secondary structure (Gray and Hentze, 1994Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. Regulation of protein synthesis by mRNA structure.Mol. Biol. Rep. 1994; 19: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the extent of adaptation of the coding sequence to the cellular tRNA pool (dos Reis et al., 2004dos Reis M. Savva R. Wernisch L.

The abundance of tRNAs that correspond to the different codons in a gene was suggested to determine the speed (Akashi, 2003Akashi H.

Thus, codons that are recognized by abundant or rare tRNAs will be respectively referred to here as codons with high and low efficiency (or as codons that are respectively highly or lowly adapted to the tRNA pool). Transcripts whose codons are biased toward the more abundant tRNAs were found to be more highly expressed (Man and Pilpel, 2007Man O. Pilpel Y.

Indeed protein expression levels can be artificially increased by designed mutations that increase their codon-tRNA adaptation (Arava et al., 2003Arava Y. Wang Y. Storey J.D. Liu C.L. Brown P.O.

Determinants of protein abundance and translation efficiency in S. cerevisiae.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: e248Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), pointing to a causal relationship between codon usage and expression level. Accordingly, the extent of adaptation between genes and the tRNA pool in different species was found to vary in evolution according to organisms' lifestyle needs (Man and Pilpel, 2007Man O. Pilpel Y. Differential translation efficiency of orthologous genes is involved in phenotypic divergence of yeast species.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). So far, studies that gauge translation efficiency have mostly considered average codon usage over entire genes (dos Reis et al., 2004dos Reis M. Savva R. Wernisch L.

Kupiec M. Ruppin E. Determinants of protein abundance and translation efficiency in S. cerevisiae.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: e248Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Such studies typically do not consider the order in which codons with low and high translation efficiency appear along the transcript. Although it was shown previously that the extent of codon bias changes along transcripts (Qin et al., 2004Qin H. Wu W.B. Comeron J.M. Kreitman M. Li W.H. Intragenic spatial patterns of codon usage bias in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes.Genetics. 2004; 168: 2245-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), it is not known whether gene sequences are arranged so as to determine specific levels of speed and accuracy of translation at various positions along transcripts. The order of high-efficiency and low-efficiency codons along transcripts could govern the process of translation, especially given that multiple ribosomes are often simultaneously loaded on a given transcript (Arava et al., 2003Arava Y. Wang Y. Storey J.D. Liu C.L. Brown P.O. Herschlag D. Genome-wide analysis of mRNA translation profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3889-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Such instructions could affect speed and processivity of translation as well as the overall cost of protein production in cells. Such “traffic rules” of translation may thus be selected for during evolution. To investigate a role for codon selection in modulating translation efficiency, we inspected open reading frame sequences and tRNA repertoires in dozens of fully sequenced genomes. The input to our computed profile of translation efficiency consists of coding sequences and a measure of adaptation between codons and the various tRNAs (dos Reis et al., 2004dos Reis M. Savva R. Wernisch L. Solving the riddle of codon usage preferences: a test for translational selection.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), which was previously shown to represent translation efficiency (dos Reis et al., 2004dos Reis M. Savva R. Wernisch L. Solving the riddle of codon usage preferences: a test for translational selection.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, Man and Pilpel, 2007Man O.

Determinants of protein abundance and translation efficiency in S. cerevisiae.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2007; 3: e248Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We describe a universally conserved translation efficiency profile that features low translation efficiency over the first ∼30–50 codons of mRNAs. This feature is conserved in species that represent the three domains of life. Translation efficiency profiles of individual genes are often very noisy, yet selected subsets of the genes in each genome display this pattern. The observed profile in the yeast S. cerevisiae accurately predicts the recently measured ribosome density profiles of mRNAs in this species (Ingolia et al., 2009Ingolia N.T. Ghaemmaghami S. Newman J.R. Weissman J.S. Genome-wide analysis in vivo of translation with nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling.Science. 2009; 324: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (2174) Google Scholar). This correlation provides an indication that codon-tRNA adaptation approximates well the speed of translation at various positions along mRNAs. This result also indicates that ribosomal speed and hence density are encoded into genes' sequences and the tRNA pool. We propose that the conserved translation efficiency profile may have been selected for in diverse species as it minimizes ribosome traffic jams and abortive protein synthesis and, as a consequence, the cost of protein expression. The translation efficiency profile of a gene is defined, for each codon position, as the estimated availability of the tRNAs that participate in translating that codon. The profile is high at codons that correspond to abundant tRNAs and low at codons that correspond to rare tRNAs. In particular, we used the tRNA-adaptation index (tAI) to evaluate translation efficiency (dos Reis et al., 2004dos Reis M. Savva R. Wernisch L. Solving the riddle of codon usage preferences: a test for translational selection.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 5036-5044Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar and Experimental Procedures) at each codon. The tAI measure of an entire gene, developed following the classical Codon Adaptation Index (Sharp and Li, 1987Sharp P.M. Li W.H. The codon Adaptation Index–a measure of directional synonymous codon usage bias, and its potential applications.Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1281-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar), is defined as the (geometric) average of tRNA availability values over all the codons in the gene (see Experimental Procedures). For each codon, the tAI considers the availability of the tRNA with the perfectly matched anticodon along with weighted contributions from imperfect codon-anticodon pairs, reflecting wobble interactions. Whereas the original tAI measure is defined as an averaged value over the entire gene (Experimental Procedures, Equation 2), here we consider separately each codon along the sequence in what we define as the “local tAI” of a codon (see Experimental Procedures, Equation 1). Table S1 (available online) contains the local tAI value of each of the 61 types of codons in a diversity of species. Typically, the tAI uses the copy number of tRNA genes in the genome as a proxy for their abundance in the cytoplasm. Although this is a common assumption (see Extended Experimental Procedures 1 and 2, Table S1, and Man and Pilpel, 2007Man O. Pilpel Y.

Specifically, we examined the correlation between tRNA abundance and their gene copy number in yeast cells growing on a rich medium. tRNA abundance measurements were based on the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence values of each tRNA on the array and came from a labeling method that relies only on the single-stranded 3′NCCA in every tRNA (demonstration of the feasibility of the method was done by quantitative comparison to 2D PAGE analysis of tRNAs; Dittmar et al., 2004Dittmar K.A.

We found that tRNA gene copy numbers are relatively highly correlated with their expression levels in rich medium conditions (r = 0.76 over 39 tRNA species, see Figure 1 and Figure S1). We also found that this correlation remains relatively high even when yeast undergo a major metabolic shift, termed “diauxic shift” (DeRisi et al., 1997DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Exploring the metabolic and genetic control of gene expression on a genomic scale.Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3641) Google Scholar), from fermenting to respiratory conditions (correlation between 0.65 and 0.71; see also Table S1). The array analysis indicates that the tRNA gene copy number provides a reasonable proxy for tRNA abundance, and we thus use it, in S. cerevisiae and in the rest of the species too, in all subsequent tAI calculations.Figure S1The tRNA Pool and the Ramp in Diauxic Shift, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) tRNA levels versus copy number in different points of the diauxic shift experiment.(B and C) Translation efficiency profile (smoothed) based on tRNA expression levels in diauxic shift after 4.5 hr (B) and after 9 hr (C); the other time points have similar profiles.

We started by inspecting the averaged translation efficiency profiles of all the genes in a given genome. To accomplish this analysis, all genes were lined up according to their start codon, and an average local tAI value at each position was calculated (see Experimental Procedures). In parallel, we also lined up all the genes in each genome relative to the stop codon and computed the average across all genes in the last position, the penultimate position, etc. Altogether we analyzed genomes of 27 organisms with representatives from all three domains of life (see Table S2). As seen in Figure 2 and Table S2 (see also Figure S1, Figure S2, and Figure S3), in almost all species examined, the averaged translation efficiency profile reveals several remarkably conserved features. Translation starts with relatively low-efficiency codons for about the first 30–50 positions. We term this part the “low-efficiency ramp” or the “ramp” for short. The ramp region is then followed by a plateau with ∼5%–10% higher translation efficiency on a genome average. A clear outlier in the ramp is the second codon position, which follows the initiating methionine that shows high efficiency compared to its neighboring codons in the majority of the species (Figure S2). This design might support a fast release and recycling of the initiating methionine tRNA. In most of the examined eukaryotic species, predominantly in fungi, the profile shows an increase in efficiency toward the last ∼50 codons of the genes, which in fungi are higher by up to 5% more than the value at the plateau in the middle section of genes (Figure 2F). Properly randomized sequences (and also some particular gene sets, see below) do not give rise to such signals (Figure 2, Table S2).Figure S2The Ramp Properties, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A and B) Computing the length of the ramp for S. cerevisiae. The length of the ramp for a local profile of tAI was computed by comparing the mean (KS-test) of sliding windows of length 20 to the mean of the profile of local tAI from codon 1 to codon 200.

Although the averaged profile over all genes in a genome is relatively smooth, the profile of single genes is often noisy. Still it was important to inspect single genes, identify those that contribute the most to the observed averaged signal, and examine the possibility that other weaker signals may have been missed at the genome-average level. We thus defined and identified the “bottleneck” region in each individual gene—a sequence window of 15 codons in length (that represents the length of the ribosome footprint region on mRNAs (Alberts et al., 2002Alberts B.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of locations of the bottleneck regions along all genes in two distantly related yeast species, S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. Both distributions show a consistent picture—a clear tendency to have the bottleneck relatively early along the genes. Other than this region there are no other regions that show any pronounced preference to contain bottlenecks. This picture shows that the ramp is a superposition of the translation efficiency profile of a relatively high number of genes (e.g., the bottleneck of 1330 genes is within the first 54 codons). The analyses presented so far have addressed individual genes on one hand and averages of entire genomes on the other. An intermediate level is that of sets of genes that share a biological function. We considered genes that share the same Gene Ontology (GO) slim categories (Hirschman et al., 2006Hirschman J.E. Balakrishnan R. Christie K.R. Costanzo M.C. Dwight S.S. Engel S.R. Fisk D.G. Hong E.L.

Figures 4A and 4B and Table S3 show the averaged profiles of genes from representative categories. We found that the genes from many of the GO slim categories show evidence of containing a ramp. For example, genes that share the GO categories “cellular carbohydrate metabolic process” and “transport” demonstrate a very clear ramp. However, other gene sets, including those that share the GO categories “transcription” and “nucleus organization” do not have a ramp (see more examples in Figure 4B and Table S3). Interestingly, the presence of the ramp is seen even among categories with very different absolute translation efficiency levels. For example, Figure 4C shows the local translation efficiency profile of cytosolic and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins in S. cerevisiae. Interestingly, although selection acted to enhance overall efficiency of the cytosolic ribosomal proteins, the initial region shows lower efficiency relative to the rest of the genes. Beyond inspection of single genes, gene sets, and genome average, the highest level of averaging is from multiple genomes. We averaged all the eukaryotic profiles and all the prokaryotic ones. Notably, the length of the ramp (see Figure S2 for an illustration of how the length of the ramp was computed) in eukaryotes and prokaryotes is around 1–3 ribosomes (depending on the definition of the actual number of nucleotides that are covered by a single ribosme; Alberts et al., 2002Alberts B.

Here we show that RNA bearing 5′-triphosphate strongly activates the RIG-I–IRF3 signaling cascade in a reconstituted system composed of RIG-I, mitochondria, and cytosol. Activation of RIG-I requires not only RNA but also polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 63 (K63) of ubiquitin. RIG-I binds specifically to K63-polyubiquitin chains through its tandem CARD domains in a manner that depends on RNA and ATP. Mutations in the CARD domains that abrogate ubiquitin binding also impair RIG-I activation. Remarkably, unanchored K63-ubiquitin chains, which are not conjugated to any target protein, potently activate RIG-I. These ubiquitin chains function as an endogenous ligand of RIG-I in human cells. Our results delineate the mechanism of RIG-I activation, identify CARD domains as a ubiquitin sensor, and demonstrate that unanchored K63-polyubiquitin chains are signaling molecules in antiviral innate immunity.

Here we show that RNA bearing 5′-triphosphate strongly activates the RIG-I–IRF3 signaling cascade in a reconstituted system composed of RIG-I, mitochondria, and cytosol. Activation of RIG-I requires not only RNA but also polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 63 (K63) of ubiquitin. RIG-I binds specifically to K63-polyubiquitin chains through its tandem CARD domains in a manner that depends on RNA and ATP. Mutations in the CARD domains that abrogate ubiquitin binding also impair RIG-I activation. Remarkably, unanchored K63-ubiquitin chains, which are not conjugated to any target protein, potently activate RIG-I. These ubiquitin chains function as an endogenous ligand of RIG-I in human cells. Our results delineate the mechanism of RIG-I activation, identify CARD domains as a ubiquitin sensor, and demonstrate that unanchored K63-polyubiquitin chains are signaling molecules in antiviral innate immunity. In vitro reconstitution of the RIG-I pathway from viral RNA binding to IRF3 activation The tandem CARD domains of RIG-I bind to K63-polyubiquitin chains Unanchored K63-polyubiquitin chains potently activate RIG-I RIG-I activation requires sequential binding of RNA and K63-polyubiquitin chains Innate immunity is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that detects and defends against invasion by microbial pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is carried out by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that include membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic receptors such as retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) (Akira et al., 2006Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Pathogen recognition and innate immunity.Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7876) Google Scholar). In the case of infection by RNA viruses and some DNA viruses, viral RNAs are the major PAMPs, which are detected by some TLRs located on the endosomal membrane (e.g., TLR7) in specialized cells (e.g., plasmacytoid dendritic cells) and RLRs in many types of cells directly infected by viruses. Recognition of viral RNAs by TLRs and RLRs triggers signal transduction cascades that culminate in the production of type I interferons (i.e., IFN-α and IFN-β) and other molecules that collectively suppress viral replication and assembly. RLRs include RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2, all of which contain a DExD-box RNA helicase domain (Fujita, 2009Fujita T.

Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2888) Google Scholar). RIG-I and LGP2 also contain a C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) that binds to RNA bearing 5′-triphosphate (5′-pppRNA) (Hornung et al., 2006Hornung V. Ellegast J. Kim S. Brzozka K. Jung A. Kato H.

The N termini of RIG-I and MDA5, but not LGP2, contain tandem caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) that mediate downstream signaling. Signaling by both RIG-I and MDA5 requires the essential adaptor protein MAVS (also known as IPS-1, VISA, or CARDIF) (Kawai et al., 2005Kawai T. Takahashi K. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H.

Cell. 2005; 19: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). MAVS contains a C-terminal transmembrane domain that targets it to the mitochondrial outer membrane and an N-terminal CARD that is exposed to the cytosol (Seth et al., 2005Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J. Identification and characterization of MAVS, a mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein that activates NF-kappaB and IRF 3.Cell. 2005; 122: 669-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). This CARD interacts with the CARDs of RIG-I, resulting in the activation of MAVS through an unknown mechanism. MAVS then activates the cytosolic protein kinases IKK and TBK1, which in turn activate the transcription factors NF-κB and IRF3, respectively. NF-κB, IRF3, and other transcription factors function together in the nucleus to induce the expression of type I interferons and other antiviral molecules. Recent studies have revealed a pivotal role of protein ubiquitination in diverse cell signaling pathways, including those in the immune system (Bhoj and Chen, 2009Bhoj V.G. Chen Z.J. Ubiquitylation in innate and adaptive immunity.Nature. 2009; 458: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In the RIG-I pathway, polyubiquitination involving lysine 63 (K63) of ubiquitin is important for signaling at steps both upstream and downstream of MAVS. Upstream of MAVS, K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I by the RING domain ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 has been proposed as an important mechanism of RIG-I activation (Gack et al., 2007Gack M.U. Shin Y.C. Joo C.H. Urano T. Liang C. Sun L. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Chen Z. Inoue S. et al.TRIM25 RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase is essential for RIG-I-mediated antiviral activity.Nature. 2007; 446: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Downstream of MAVS, the activation of TBK1 requires the E2 Ubc5 and K63 polyubiquitination of an unknown target (Zeng et al., 2009Zeng W. Xu M. Liu S. Sun L. Chen Z.J. Key role of Ubc5 and lysine-63 polyubiquitination in viral activation of IRF3.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 315-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Several additional ubiquitin ligases (e.g., Riplet/REUL, RNF125) have been shown to positively or negatively regulate the RIG-I pathway (Nakhaei et al., 2009Nakhaei P. Genin P. Civas A. Hiscott J. RIG-I-like receptors: sensing and responding to RNA virus infection.Semin. Immunol. 2009; 21: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical mechanisms by which RIG-I and TBK1 are activated by ubiquitination remain poorly understood. To dissect the signaling mechanisms in the RIG-I pathway, we establish a cell-free system that mimics viral infection in intact cells. This in vitro reconstitution system contains recombinant RIG-I protein, mitochondria, cytosol, RNA, and ubiquitination enzymes including TRIM25. We demonstrate that 5′-pppRNA and dsRNA, which resemble viral RNA, can activate the entire RIG-I signaling cascade in vitro, leading to activation of IRF3 and NF-κB. Interestingly, we find that upon incubation with both RNA and unanchored K63-polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains, RIG-I is fully activated to cause IRF3 dimerization. We show that the N terminus of RIG-I, termed RIG-I(N), which contains tandem CARDs, binds specifically to K63-polyUb chains, and that this binding is both necessary and sufficient to activate RIG-I(N). Furthermore, we devise a protocol to isolate endogenous ubiquitin chains associated with RIG-I in a human cell line and demonstrate that these are unanchored K63-polyUb chains with potent ability to activate RIG-I. Our results support a model in which RIG-I binds to two ligands, viral RNA and endogenous ubiquitin chains, in a sequential manner through the C-terminal RD and N-terminal CARDs, respectively. The binding of both ligands is required for full activation of RIG-I. To reconstitute the RIG-I pathway in vitro, we first examined whether RIG-I isolated from virus-infected cells could cause IRF3 activation in the presence of mitochondria, which contain MAVS, and cytosolic extracts, which contain TBK1 and many other components. A hallmark of IRF3 activation is its dimerization, which depends on its phosphorylation by TBK1 and can be measured by native gel electrophoresis (Yoneyama et al., 2002Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fujita T. Control of IRF-3 activation by phosphorylation.J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To set up the assay, HEK293T cells stably expressing full-length RIG-I with a C-terminal Flag tag were infected with Sendai virus (SeV) or uninfected, then RIG-I was affinity purified (Figure 1A ). Crude mitochondria (P5) and cytosolic extracts (S5) were prepared from uninfected HEK293T cells by differential centrifugation (Figure 1B), and 35S-labeled IRF3 protein was synthesized by in vitro translation. As shown in Figure 1C, dimerization of IRF3 was observed when RIG-I from virus-infected cells was incubated with mitochondria (P5) and cytosolic extracts (S5) in the presence of ATP (lane 3). In contrast, RIG-I from mock-treated cells did not promote IRF3 dimerization (lane 2). The activation of IRF3 required both cytosol and mitochondria (lanes 5 and 6). Mitochondria isolated from cells depleted of MAVS by RNAi could not support IRF3 dimerization (Figure S1A available online), confirming that MAVS is essential for activating the downstream pathway in this in vitro assay. When RIG-I was isolated from cells depleted of TRIM25 by RNAi, its ability to promote IRF3 dimerization in the in vitro assay was greatly reduced (Figure S1B), supporting an important role of TRIM25 in RIG-I activation. As we have shown recently, mitochondria isolated from virus-infected cells activated IRF3 in the absence of RIG-I (Figure 1C, lane 1) (Zeng et al., 2009Zeng W. Xu M. Liu S. Sun L. Chen Z.J.

The p-IκBα antibody detects phosphorylation at Ser32 and Ser36 of IκBα. Transfection of cells with synthetic RNAs, such as the dsRNA analog poly(I:C) and 5′-pppRNA, potently induces IRF3 dimerization. To test if RNA could activate the entire RIG-I pathway in vitro, we expressed and purified full-length RIG-I from insect cells (Sf9; Figure 1D, lower left) and incubated it with ATP and a 79 nucleotide (79 nt) 5′-pppRNA (Figure S1C). This RNA strongly induced IFN-β when transfected into HEK293-IFN-β-luciferse reporter cells (Figure S1D). However, incubation of this RNA with the recombinant RIG-I protein did not cause IRF3 dimerization in the reconstituted system (Figure 1D, lane 1 in lower right panel). As ubiquitination has been shown to be important in the RIG-I pathway, we incubated RIG-I with E1, Ubc5c (E2), TRIM25 (E3), and ubiquitin together with ATP and RNA. Remarkably, this condition caused RIG-I to activate the entire pathway, resulting in IRF3 dimerization (Figure 1D, lane 3 in lower right panel). A K270A mutation in the ATPase domain of RIG-I, which abrogates the ability of RIG-I to induce interferons in vivo (Yoneyama et al., 2004Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. The RNA helicase RIG-I has an essential function in double-stranded RNA-induced innate antiviral responses.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2888) Google Scholar), also abolished its ability to induce IRF3 dimerization in vitro. Poly(I:C) stimulated IRF3 dimerization in this reconstituted system in a manner dependent on ubiquitin, E1, Ubc5c, TRIM25, and RIG-I (Figure 1E). Activation of RIG-I was also observed with another 5′-pppRNA containing 135 nucleotides (135 nt) (Figure 1F). Dephosphorylation of the 5′-pppRNAs with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) destroyed their ability to activate IRF3 in vitro (Figure 1F) and IFN-β induction in HEK293T cells (Figure S1D). In contrast, treatment of poly(I:C) with SAP did not inhibit its activity, consistent with the previous report that this dsRNA analog activates RIG-I and MDA5 in a manner independent of 5′-triphosphate (Kato et al., 2008Kato H. Takeuchi O. Mikamo-Satoh E. Hirai R. Kawai T. Matsushita K. Hiiragi A. Dermody T.S. Fujita T. Akira S. Length-dependent recognition of double-stranded ribonucleic acids by retinoic acid-inducible gene-I and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5.J. Exp. Med. 2008; 205: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). As expected, the DNA poly(dI:dC) did not activate the RIG-I pathway in vitro or in cells (Figure 1F and Figure S1D). In vitro reconstitution of the RIG-I pathway also led to site-specific phosphorylation of IRF3 and IκBα (Extended Results and Figures S1E–S1G). To determine if RIG-I could be activated by naturally occurring viral RNA, we incubated purified RIG-I protein with total RNA from HEK293T cells infected with Sendai virus. Indeed, RNA from virus-infected but not mock-treated cells stimulated RIG-I to activate IRF3 (Figure 1G, lanes 1–3). To estimate the sensitivity of 5′-pppRNA detection by RIG-I, we incubated RIG-I with different amounts of 5′-pppRNA in the presence or absence of HEK293T cellular RNA (Figure 1G, lanes 4–18). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of the 5′-pppRNA was estimated at 1.2 nM and 0.4 nM in the absence and presence of the cellular RNA, respectively (Figure 1H). It is not clear how the cellular RNA enhances the potency of 5′-pppRNA, but one possibility is that these RNAs reduce the nonspecific loss of very small amounts of 5′-pppRNA in the reactions. In any case, the fact that the presence of a large excess of cellular RNA does not interfere with the specific recognition of 5′-pppRNA by RIG-I underscores the remarkable specificity of viral RNA detection by RIG-I. Assuming that the cytoplasm of a human cell has a volume of ∼500 μm3, we estimated that less than 20 molecules of viral RNA in a cell (equivalent to ∼0.07 nM) are sufficient to trigger detectable IRF3 dimerization. Thus, our in vitro reconstitution recapitulates the entire RIG-I pathway with exquisite sensitivity and specificity for 5′-pppRNA (see Discussion). Ubc5 is a family of E2s comprising highly homologous isoforms (Ubc5a, b, and c; putative Ubc5d in human) that catalyze the synthesis of polyUb chains linked through various lysines of ubiquitin, including K63 (Xu et al., 2009Xu M. Skaug B. Zeng W. Chen Z.J. A Ubiquitin replacement strategy in human cells reveals distinct mechanisms of IKK activation by TNFalpha and IL-1beta.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 302-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast to Ubc5, the E2 complex consisting of Ubc13 and Uev1A is highly specific in synthesizing K63-polyUb chains (Deng et al., 2000Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J.

To determine the E2 involved in RIG-I activation, we examined a panel of E2s for their ability to stimulate RIG-I in the presence of TRIM25 and RNA (Figure 2A ). The Ubc5 isoforms (Ubc5a, b, and c) and Ubc13/Uev1A were capable of stimulating RIG-I to promote IRF3 dimerization. In contrast, Ubc3, Ubc7, and E2-25K had no activity (Figure 2A), despite the ability of these E2s to form thioesters with ubiquitin (data not shown; see also Zeng et al., 2009Zeng W. Xu M. Liu S.

To test if Ubc5 and/or Ubc13 are involved in the activation of MAVS by RIG-I, we established human osteosarcoma U2OS cell lines stably integrated with tetracycline-inducible shRNA vectors targeting both Ubc13 and two isoforms of Ubc5 (Ubc5b and c) (Xu et al., 2009Xu M.

Cell. 2009; 36: 302-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2B, the mitochondria from the cells depleted of Ubc13, Ubc5b, and Ubc5c lost the ability to activate IRF3. These results suggest that Ubc5a and Ubc5d, which are not targeted by the Ubc5 shRNAs, play a minor role in IRF3 activation in U2OS cells. RNAi of Ubc13 or Ubc5 alone partially inhibited the IRF3-stimulatory activity of the mitochondria from virus-infected cells (Figure S2A; Figure S3 in Zeng et al., 2009Zeng W. Xu M. Liu S. Sun L.

These results suggest that both Ubc5 and Ubc13 are involved in the activation of MAVS in the mitochondria by RIG-I in response to viral infection.Figure S2Role of Ubc13, Ubc5, and K63 Polyubiquitination in RIG-I and MAVS Activation, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Depletion of Ubc13 partially inhibits viral activation of MAVS in the mitochondria.

Ubiquitination reactions contained E1, Ubc5c (top panel) or Ubc13/Uev1A (bottom panel), TRIM25, and wild-type or mutant ubiquitin as indicated. Ubiquitin chains were detected with a ubiqutin antibody. To determine if K63 of ubiquitin is required for RIG-I activation in the in vitro system, we incubated various ubiquitin lysine mutants with RIG-I in the presence of RNA, ATP, E1, TRIM25, and Ubc5c or Ubc13/Uev1A. The reaction mixture was then incubated with the mitochondrial fraction (P5) to activate MAVS. The activated mitochondria were isolated and then tested for their ability to stimulate IRF3 dimerization in the presence of cytosolic extracts (Figure 2C). The ubiquitin proteins containing a lysine at position 63 (wild-type, K48R and K63-only) were capable of activating RIG-I, whereas those containing a substitution at K63 (K63R, K48-only, KO, and methylated ubiquitin) had no activity (Figure 2C; see Figure S2C for an illustration of ubiquitin mutants). Interestingly, although Ubc5c and TRIM25 catalyze the synthesis of polyUb chains from K63R (Figure S2D, lane 2), these chains did not stimulate RIG-I (Figure 2C, lane 2), indicating that K63-polyUb chain synthesis is specifically required for RIG-I activation in vitro. To investigate the role of K63 polyubiquitination in the activation of MAVS in cells, we used recently developed U2OS cell lines in which endogenous ubiquitin is replaced with wild-type or K63R mutant of ubiquitin through a tetracycline-inducible strategy (Xu et al., 2009Xu M. Skaug B. Zeng W. Chen Z.J. A Ubiquitin replacement strategy in human cells reveals distinct mechanisms of IKK activation by TNFalpha and IL-1beta.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 302-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2D, depletion of endogenous ubiquitin severely impaired the ability of the mitochondria to promote IRF3 dimerization, but this activity was rescued by the expression of the wild-type ubiquitin transgene. In contrast, when the endogenous ubiquitin was replaced with the K63R mutant, the mitochondria isolated from these cells failed to activate IRF3 in the in vitro assay, strongly suggesting that K63 polyubiquitination is essential for viral activation of MAVS in the mitochondria. The N terminus of RIG-I contains tandem CARDs, which, when overexpressed in mammalian cells, constitutively activate IRF3 (Yoneyama et al., 2004Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N.

The mice develop a spectrum of tumors, including breast tumors that retain two copies of Pten, suggesting that subtle changes in expression can predispose to tumorigenesis. Cancer susceptibility has been attributed to at least one heterozygous genetic alteration in a tumor suppressor gene (TSG)1. It has been hypothesized that subtle variations in TSG expression can promote cancer development2,3. However, this hypothesis has not yet been definitively supported in vivo. Pten is a TSG frequently lost in human cancer and mutated in inherited cancer-predisposition syndromes4. Here we analyze Pten hypermorphic mice (Ptenhy/+), expressing 80% normal levels of Pten. Ptenhy/+ mice develop a spectrum of tumors, with breast tumors occurring at the highest penetrance. All breast tumors analyzed here retained two intact copies of Pten and maintained Pten levels above heterozygosity. Notably, subtle downregulation of Pten altered the steady-state biology of the mammary tissues and the expression profiles of genes involved in cancer cell proliferation. We present an alterative working model for cancer development in which subtle reductions in the dose of TSGs predispose to tumorigenesis in a tissue-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W1974057366,"We compared brain activations in response to acute noxious thermal stimuli in controls and chronic back pain (CBP) patients. Pain perception and related cortical activation patterns were similar in the two groups. However, nucleus accumbens (NAc) activity differentiated the groups at a very high accuracy, exhibiting phasic and tonic responses with distinct properties. Positive phasic NAc activations at stimulus onset and offset tracked stimulus salience and, in normal subjects, predicted reward (pain relief) magnitude at stimulus offset. In CBP, NAc activity correlated with different cortical circuitry from that of normals and phasic activity at stimulus offset was negative in polarity, suggesting that the acute pain relieves the ongoing back pain. The relieving effect was confirmed in a separate psychophysical study in CBP. Therefore, in contrast to somatosensory pathways, which reflect sensory properties of acute noxious stimuli, NAc activity in humans encodes its predicted value and anticipates its analgesic potential on chronic pain."

LIS1, NudE, and NudEL are dynein interactors initially implicated in brain developmental disease but now known to be required in cell migration, nuclear, centrosomal, and microtubule transport, mitosis, and growth cone motility. Identification of a specific role for these proteins in cytoplasmic dynein motor regulation has remained elusive. We find that NudE stably recruits LIS1 to the dynein holoenzyme molecule, where LIS1 interacts with the motor domain during the prepowerstroke state of the dynein crossbridge cycle. NudE abrogates dynein force production, whereas LIS1 alone or with NudE induces a persistent-force dynein state that improves ensemble function of multiple dyneins for transport under high-load conditions. These results likely explain the requirement for LIS1 and NudE in the transport of nuclei, centrosomes, chromosomes, and the microtubule cytoskeleton as well as the particular sensitivity of migrating neurons to reduced LIS1 expression.

In the current study, we used biochemical and biophysical approaches to investigate whether and how LIS1 and NudE might affect dynein motor activity. We find that NudE recruits LIS1 to the dynein molecule, and that, surprisingly, LIS1 binds to the dynein motor domain at the prepowerstoke stage in its crossbridge cycle. Using single-molecule measurements we find that NudE inhibits dynein force production. LIS1 alone or with NudE converts dynein to a sustained-force state and markedly enhances ensemble motor function for high load transport. These data provide insight into the molecular basis for lissencephaly and the mechanism of action of LIS1, NudE, and NudEL in a broad range of biological functions. To define more completely the interactions between dynein and LIS1 or NudE, we used recombinant LIS1 and NudE and purified cytoplasmic dynein from calf brain (Paschal et al., 1987Paschal B.M. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. MAP 1C is a microtubule-activated ATPase which translocates microtubules in vitro and has dynein-like properties.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1273-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) using a method that includes a deaffinity step to specifically deplete kinesin motors as potential contaminants. The purified dynein holoenzyme (Figure 1D ) is a complex of two 532 kDa heavy chains, the C-terminal 2/3 of which corresponds to the motor domains. The N-terminal dynein tail domains mediate dimerization and interactions with intermediate, light intermediate, and light chains. To examine dynein motor domain interactions specifically, we used a previously characterized 380 kDa baculovirus-expressed C-terminal dynein heavy chain fragment (Hook et al., 2005Hook P. Mikami A. Shafer B. Chait B.T. Rosenfeld S.S. Vallee R.B. Long range allosteric control of cytoplasmic dynein ATPase activity by the stalk and C-terminal domains.J. Biol.

Despite yeast two-hybrid and mammalian cell coexpression evidence for an interaction between LIS1 and the AAA1 ATPase portion of the dynein motor domain (Sasaki et al., 2000Sasaki S. Shionoya A.

To test whether this disparity could relate to changes in motor conformational states, we evaluated the effects of nucleotide and nucleotide analogs on the LIS1-motor domain interaction. We observed little or no interaction in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ATP, AMPPNP (not shown), or ADP but a clear interaction in the presence of ATP plus sodium vanadate (VO4), as indicated by a shift in LIS1 to the dynein motor domain peak (molar ratio dynein motor:LIS1 dimer = 1.3; Figures 2A and 2B). A similar, nucleotide-dependent interaction is seen between LIS1 and the purified brain dynein (Figure 2C). ATP hydrolysis in the presence of VO4 leads to a dynein-ADP-VO4 dead-end complex, which is thought to mimic the prepower stroke transition state (Shimizu and Johnson, 1983Shimizu T. Johnson K.A.

Dynein structure and power stroke.Nature. 2003; 421: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Our results suggest, therefore, that LIS1 interacts with the dynein motor domain at a specific, transient stage in its enzymatic cycle. The interaction site within the motor domain remains to be explored further but could involve AAA1 (Sasaki et al., 2000Sasaki S. Shionoya A. Ishida M. Gambello M.J. Yingling J. Wynshaw-Boris A.

NudEL has been reported to interact with the dynein motor domain on the basis of yeast two-hybrid analysis (Sasaki et al., 2000Sasaki S. Shionoya A. Ishida M. Gambello M.J. Yingling J.

We detect no interaction between recombinant NudE and dynein motor domain under any nucleotide condition (Figure S1B available online) but have, instead, observed a clear interaction between NudE and the intact cytoplasmic dynein complex mediated through the intermediate and light chains located in the base of the dynein molecule (Stehman et al., 2007Stehman S.A.

Biol. 2003; 23: 1239-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), leading us to speculate that NudE or NudEL might act to link LIS1 to dynein (Figure 7). Indeed, in the absence of nucleotide, the ability of LIS1 to pull down purified calf brain dynein was completely dependent on addition of NudE (Figures 1A and 1B). The interaction showed a clear NudE concentration dependence and appeared to saturate at a molar stoichiometry of ∼1:1 NudE:dynein (Figure 1B). LIS1 and dynein showed no evidence of competition for NudE binding (Figure 1C). Together, our results indicate that LIS1 alone interacts transiently with the dynein motor domain, but that NudE tethers LIS1 to dynein to form a more stable tripartite complex. We also examined the effects of LIS1 and NudE on dynein-microtubule interactions. Alone, neither LIS1 nor NudE bound microtubules (Figure 2D). LIS1 had little effect on dynein-microtubule binding in the apo or ATP state (Figure 2E) but increased binding 5.1-fold in the presence of ADP-VO4 (Figure 2E). This increase is intriguing because dynein binds weakly to microtubules in this condition (Imamula et al., 2007Imamula K. Kon T. Ohkura R. Sutoh K.

Chem. 1983; 258: 13841-13846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that LIS1 increases the affinity of dynein for microtubules specifically during the prepowerstroke stage of the crossbridge cycle. In contrast, NudE decreased dynein-microtubule binding by 60% in the absence of nucleotide, which corresponds to the strong binding (apo) state of the dynein mechanochemical cycle (Figure 2E). Little further effect on dynein-microtubule binding was observed in the presence of ATP or ATP plus VO4 (Figure 2E). LIS1 had no effect on basal or microtubule-stimulated dynein ATPase activity in our assays (Figure S1A), in contrast to one report (Mesngon et al., 2006Mesngon M.T. Tarricone C. Hebbar S. Guillotte A.M. Schmitt E.W. Lanier L. Musacchio A. King S.J. Smith D.S. Regulation of cytoplasmic dynein ATPase by Lis1.J.

However, the microtubule-stimulated component of dynein ATPase activity was inhibited 50% by addition of NudE alone and by 72% with further addition of LIS1 (Figure S1A). To determine the effects of LIS1 and NudE on the behavior of individual dynein molecules directly, we adsorbed dynein to carboxylated polystyrene beads and monitored transport and force production according to established methods (Gennerich et al., 2007Gennerich A.

Moderate levels of LIS1 did not affect processivity (Figure 3A), but net bead velocity was somewhat reduced due to increased bead pausing. Discrete pauses were infrequent at 1:1 LIS1:dynein but increased with LIS1 concentration (Figure 3C; note extreme example in Figure S3).Figure S2Lack of Effect of NudE and LIS1 on Kinesin Motility and Force Production, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Representative records of single-motor force production in an optical trap are shown for beads adsorbed with a recombinant K560 kinesin construct alone (K), in the presence of NudE (KN; K:N 1:10), and in the presence of both NudE and LIS1 (KNL; K:N:L 1:10:10).

https://openalex.org/W2148627082,"The genetic code is degenerate. Each amino acid is encoded by up to six synonymous codons; the choice between these codons influences gene expression. Here, we show that in coding sequences, once a particular codon has been used, subsequent occurrences of the same amino acid do not use codons randomly, but favor codons that use the same tRNA. The effect is pronounced in rapidly induced genes, involves both frequent and rare codons and diminishes only slowly as a function of the distance between subsequent synonymous codons. Furthermore, we found that in S. cerevisiae codon correlation accelerates translation relative to the translation of synonymous yet anticorrelated sequences. The data suggest that tRNA diffusion away from the ribosome is slower than translation, and that some tRNA channeling takes place at the ribosome. They also establish that the dynamics of translation leave a significant signature at the level of the genome."

Gene expression-based biomarkers facilitating such tailoring of chemotherapy in cancer, but not autoimmunity, have been identified and translated into clinical practice. We show that transcriptional profiling of purified CD8(+) T cells, which avoids the confounding influences of unseparated cells, identifies two distinct subject subgroups predicting long-term prognosis in two autoimmune diseases, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), a chronic, severe disease characterized by inflammation of medium-sized and small blood vessels, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), characterized by autoantibodies, immune complex deposition and diverse clinical manifestations ranging from glomerulonephritis to neurological dysfunction. We show that the subset of genes defining the poor prognostic group is enriched for genes involved in the interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) pathway and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and those expressed by memory T cells. Furthermore, the poor prognostic group is associated with an expanded CD8(+) T cell memory population. These subgroups, which are also found in the normal population and can be identified by measuring expression of only three genes, raise the prospect of individualized therapy and suggest new potential therapeutic targets in autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1964816418,"Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs) bind to inactive Rho GTPases in the cytosol, but their function remains unclear. Several Rho GTPases are now shown to compete for RhoGDI binding and this is crucial for regulating Rho GTPase turnover and activation. At steady state, most Rho GTPases are bound in the cytosol to Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (RhoGDIs)1. RhoGDIs have generally been considered to hold Rho proteins passively in an inactive state within the cytoplasm. Here we describe an evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which RhoGDI1 controls the homeostasis of Rho proteins in eukaryotic cells. We found that depletion of RhoGDI1 promotes misfolding and degradation of the cytosolic geranylgeranylated pool of Rho GTPases while activating the remaining membrane-bound fraction. Because RhoGDI1 levels are limiting, and Rho proteins compete for binding to RhoGDI1, overexpression of an exogenous Rho GTPase displaces endogenous Rho proteins bound to RhoGDI1, inducing their degradation and inactivation. These results raise important questions about the conclusions drawn from studies that manipulate Rho protein levels. In many cases the response observed may arise not simply from the overexpression itself but from additional effects on the levels and activity of other Rho GTPases as a result of competition for binding to RhoGDI1; this may require a re-evaluation of previously published studies that rely exclusively on these techniques."

https://openalex.org/W2059788298,"Damaged DNA templates provide an obstacle to the replication fork and can cause genome instability. In eukaryotes, tolerance to damaged DNA is mediated largely by the RAD6 pathway involving ubiquitylation of the DNA polymerase processivity factor PCNA. Whereas monoubiquitylation of PCNA mediates error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS), polyubiquitylation triggers an error-free pathway. Both branches of this pathway are believed to occur in S phase in order to ensure replication completion. However, we found that limiting TLS or the error-free pathway to the G2/M phase of the cell-cycle efficiently promote lesion tolerance. Thus, our findings indicate that both branches of the DNA damage tolerance pathway operate effectively after chromosomal replication, outside S phase. We therefore propose that the RAD6 pathway acts on single-stranded gaps left behind newly restarted replication forks."
https://openalex.org/W2023578856,"A plethora of growth factors regulate keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation that control hair morphogenesis and skin barrier formation. Wavy hair phenotypes in mice result from naturally occurring loss-of-function mutations in the genes for TGF-alpha and EGFR. Conversely, excessive activities of TGF-alpha/EGFR result in hairless phenotypes and skin cancers. Unexpectedly, we found that mice lacking the Trpv3 gene also exhibit wavy hair coat and curly whiskers. Here we show that keratinocyte TRPV3, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of Ca(2+)-permeant channels, forms a signaling complex with TGF-alpha/EGFR. Activation of EGFR leads to increased TRPV3 channel activity, which in turn stimulates TGF-alpha release. TRPV3 is also required for the formation of the skin barrier by regulating the activities of transglutaminases, a family of Ca(2+)-dependent crosslinking enzymes essential for keratinocyte cornification. Our results show that a TRP channel plays a role in regulating growth factor signaling by direct complex formation."

Ricin from the seeds of the castor oil plant Ricinus communis is classified as a potential bioterror agent for which no treatment is available, and, as such, constitutes a concern for health authorities (Audi et al., 2005Audi J. Belson M. Patel M. Schier J. Osterloh J. Ricin poisoning: a comprehensive review.JAMA. 2005; 294: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The family of Shiga toxins includes Shiga toxin produced by Shigella dysenteriae, and Shiga-like toxins 1 (Stx1) and 2 (Stx2) from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli strains (for a review, see Johannes and Römer, 2010Johannes L. Römer W. Shiga toxins—from cell biology to biomedical applications.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 105-116PubMed Google Scholar). While Shiga toxin and Stx1 are 99% identical, Stx1 and Stx2 share only 56% amino acid sequence identity. Infections with Shiga-like toxin (SLT) producing bacteria can cause hemorrhagic colitis, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), and death (Tarr et al., 2005Tarr P.I. Gordon C.A. Chandler W.L. Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli and haemolytic uraemic syndrome.Lancet. 2005; 365: 1073-1086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). SLTs and ricin are composed of two subunits (Johannes and Römer, 2010Johannes L. Römer W. Shiga toxins—from cell biology to biomedical applications.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 105-116PubMed Google Scholar, Lord et al., 2003Lord M.J. Jolliffe N.A. Marsden C.J. Pateman C.S. Smith D.C. Spooner R.A. Watson P.D. Roberts L.M. Ricin. Mechanisms of cytotoxicity.Toxicol. Rev. 2003; 22: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Their A subunits have ribosomal RNA (rRNA) N-glycosidase activity and catalyze the removal of the same adenine at position 4324 of 28S rRNA, thereby inhibiting protein biosynthesis. By virtue of their B subunits, these toxins bind to their cell surface receptors: galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine moieties of glycoproteins and glycolipids for ricin, and the glycosphingolipid globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb3 or CD77) in the case of Stx1 and Stx2. After internalization by clathrin-dependent and independent mechanisms, these toxins are transported from early endosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), via the Golgi apparatus (Johannes and Römer, 2010Johannes L. Römer W. Shiga toxins—from cell biology to biomedical applications.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 105-116PubMed Google Scholar, Sandvig and van Deurs, 2005Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Delivery into cells: lessons learned from plant and bacterial toxins.Gene Ther. 2005; 12: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This still poorly explored transport pathway was termed the retrograde route. It is involved in a number of physiological and pathological situations ranging from morphogen gradient formations and growth factor trafficking to toxin entry and Alzheimer's disease (reviewed in Johannes and Popoff, 2008Johannes L. Popoff V. Tracing the retrograde route in protein trafficking.Cell. 2008; 135: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). A critical step in the retrograde route is the escape from the endocytic pathway at the level of early endosomes (Mallard et al., 1998Mallard F. Antony C. Tenza D. Salamero J. Goud B. Johannes L. Direct pathway from early/recycling endosomes to the Golgi apparatus revealed through the study of shiga toxin B-fragment transport.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 973-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This retrograde sorting process is highly selective in that only small quantities of bulk membrane and fluid phase are targeted nonspecifically from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Snider and Rogers, 1985Snider M.D. Rogers O.C. Intracellular movement of cell surface receptors after endocytosis: resialylation of asialo-transferrin receptor in human erythroleukemia cells.J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 826-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A large number of proteins have been shown to be critical (reviewed in Bonifacino and Rojas, 2006Bonifacino J.S. Rojas R. Retrograde transport from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, Johannes and Popoff, 2008Johannes L. Popoff V. Tracing the retrograde route in protein trafficking.Cell. 2008; 135: 1175-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The current model suggests that clathrin and clathrin-binding proteins such as epsinR, AP-1, OCRL, and RME-8 are required for the formation of retrograde tubules on early endosomes. These retrograde tubules are then processed, involving the retromer complex (Bonifacino and Hurley, 2008Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Retromer.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The fusion of retrograde transport intermediates with the TGN requires tethering factors such as golgin-97, GCC88, GCC185, and GARP, SNARE complexes involving syntaxin 16 and syntaxin 5, and the GTPase Rab6a′. To date, there is no proven, safe treatment for ricin intoxication or complicated infections by SLT-producing Escherichia coli strains other than supportive care (http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/ricin/clinicians/treatment.asp; http://www.cdc.gov/nczved/dfbmd/disease_listing/stec_gi.html). For this, the identification of compounds that inhibit endocytic toxin trafficking without exhibiting detrimental effects on cell viability and organelle integrity would be of interest. In this study, we used cell-based high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify pharmacologically active compounds able to protect cells from intoxication by ricin and Stx1 and 2. We identified two compounds capable of blocking specifically the early endosome-to-TGN toxin transport step without affecting endogenous retrograde cargo proteins, other intracellular trafficking pathways, or, more generally, organelle integrity. One compound, termed Retro-2, clearly protects mice from intranasal LD90 challenge by ricin and is particularly active to provide total protection at high doses. On the basis of a previously described method (Liger et al., 1997Liger D. vanderSpek J.C. Gaillard C. Cansier C. Murphy J.R. Leboulch P. Gillet D. Characterization and receptor specific toxicity of two diphtheria toxin-related interleukin-3 fusion proteins DAB389-mIL-3 and DAB389-(Gly4Ser)2-mIL-3.FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 157-161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a cell-based assay was derived for HTS of ricin inhibitors. In this assay, the inhibitory effect of ricin on protein biosynthesis of intact cells is measured through the incorporation of radioactive leucine into neosynthesized polypeptides. We screened for small molecules that restored normal levels of protein biosynthesis in the presence of ricin, i.e., that inhibited the intoxication of cells by ricin. HTS was performed on a library of 16,480 drug-like compounds at a final concentration of 25 μM (Figure 1A ). Twelve compounds provided at least 10% inhibition against ricin cytotoxicity. By examining the effect of increasing ricin concentrations on protein biosynthesis in the presence of these compounds, we confirmed four hits (hit rate of 0.024%) as robust ricin inhibitors. For reasons that will be apparent later, two lead compounds were named Retro-1 and Retro-2 and chosen for further analysis. They combined minimal apparent cellular toxicity with robust activity against ricin and SLTs (see below). Their heterocyclic structures with central imine or benzodiazepine moieties are shown in Figure 1B. Given that inhalation is believed to be the most efficient exposure route to ricin (Audi et al., 2005Audi J. Belson M. Patel M. Schier J. Osterloh J. Ricin poisoning: a comprehensive review.JAMA. 2005; 294: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), their protective activity was tested by challenging human pulmonary carcinoma alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells with increasing concentrations of ricin under conditions of the HTS assay (Figure 1C). Both compounds showed significant increases in EC50 values, corresponding to protection factors of 4.6 ± 1.2 standard deviation (SD; n = 11) for Retro-1 and 3.6 ± 1.1 SD (n = 8) for Retro-2. These experiments show that both compounds partially protect A549 cells against ricin exposure. A similar protective effect was observed on HeLa cells (Figure 2A , see below), demonstrating that compound activity was not restricted to a specific cell type. No additive or synergistic effects were found when A549 or HeLa cells were treated simultaneously with both compounds (Figures S1A and S1B available online). Incubation of A549 or HeLa cells with 25 μM Retro-1 or Retro-2 for as long as 4 days did not affect protein biosynthesis (Figures S1C and S1D), indicating that the compounds were not toxic at the concentrations used in this study.Figure S1Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) Absence of synergistic or additive effects for Retro-1 and Retro-2.

Data represent the means ± SD of 5 wells. No alteration of ricin activity on a 14-mer RNA template mimicking the toxin's natural ribosomal RNA substrate was detected in the presence of Retro-1 and Retro-2 (F. Becher, E. Duriez and E. Ezan, personal communication). Moreover, preincubation of ricin (or SLTs, see below) with Retro-1 or Retro-2 did not improve the compounds' protective effect, while it was found to be necessary to preincubate cells for 30 min with the compounds to obtain optimal protection (data not shown). These different sets of data therefore demonstrated that Retro-1 and Retro-2 do not inhibit the toxins directly. Rather, they appear to interfere with early stages of toxin entry into cells. As ricin shares with SLTs the trafficking via the retrograde route, we analyzed whether Retro-1 and Retro-2 also protected cells against these toxins. Protection experiments were performed on HeLa cells, because A549 cells do not express the Gb3 glycolipid and are thus resistant to SLTs. After pretreatment for 30 min with vehicle alone (0.04% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]), or with 20 μM Retro-1 or Retro-2, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of ricin, Stx1, or Stx2, and protein biosynthesis was then measured with radiolabeled methionine. Retro-1 and Retro-2 protected HeLa cells from a 4 hr ricin challenge (Figure 2A). Ricin toxicity on HeLa cells was reduced 3.6-fold ± 0.1-fold or 2.7-fold ± 0.1-fold (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]) for Retro-1 or Retro-2, respectively (Figure 2F). These values are similar to those obtained on A549 cells (Figure 1C). For SLTs, robust inhibition of protein biosynthesis was observed on HeLa cells as early as 1 hr after toxin exposure. At this time (Figures 2B and 2D), or after 4 hr of toxin incubation (Figures 2C and 2E), Retro-1 (left column) and Retro-2 (right column) strongly protect cells against Stx1 (Figures 2B and 2C) and Stx2 (Figures 2D and 2E). Protective indexes between 22 and >100 were measured (Figure 2F). Very clearly, Retro-1 and Retro-2 inhibit HeLa cell intoxication by ricin, Stx1, and Stx2. To analyze whether Retro-1 and Retro-2 affect intracellular toxin trafficking, we used the B subunit of Stx1, termed STxB, which has been developed as a morphological and quantitative biochemical tool to study various steps of toxin endocytosis and retrograde transport (Amessou et al., 2006Amessou M. Popoff V. Yelamos B. Saint-Pol A. Johannes L. Measuring retrograde transport to the trans-Golgi network.Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2006; Chapter 15: Unit 15.10PubMed Google Scholar). In a first approach, we measured the retrograde transport of STxB to the TGN using a quantitative biochemical assay. This assay is based on the use of an STxB variant, STxB-Sulf2, to which a tandem of protein sulfation sites was added by genetic fusion. Upon retrograde transport to the TGN, STxB-Sulf2 becomes the substrate of TGN-localized sulfotransferase that catalyzes the posttranslational transfer of radioactive sulfate from the medium onto a tyrosyl residue of the recognition sequence. Detection of sulfated STxB-Sulf2 by autoradiography thereby allows for the quantification of its retrograde arrival at the TGN. In cells pretreated for 30 min with 20 μM of Retro-1 or Retro-2, we observed a 80% ± 4% or 82% ± 3% (mean ± SEM) loss of the sulfation signal compared to vehicle-treated control cells (Figure 3A ). This inhibitory effect persisted for at least 4 hr (Figure S2A). Importantly, total cellular sulfation levels (Figure S2B) and STxB binding (Figure S2C) were not affected on inhibitor-treated cells, demonstrating that sulfotransferase activity was not perturbed, that cells were in a healthy state under all conditions, and that the reduced sulfation signal was not due to reduced amounts of cell-associated STxB.Figure S2STxB Trafficking Analysis, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Retrograde transport of STxB to the Golgi apparatus is markedly reduced for at least 4 hr after addition of Retro-2.

STxB-Sulf2 was bound to these cells, which were then incubated for the indicated times (20-240 min, 37°C) in the presence of 35S-sulfate and the continued presence of Retro-2. 35S-sulfated STxB-Sulf2 was quantified as described in Experimental Procedures.

The inhibition of retrograde transport to the TGN could occur at the plasma membrane or on endosomes. To address the first possibility, we quantified the endocytic uptake of STxB in the presence of Retro-1 or Retro-2 (Figure 3B), by using a conjugate of STxB to which a biotin was linked via a thiol cleavable disulphide bond. The use of a membrane impermeable reducing agent allowed us to determine the percentage of cell surface inaccessible (internalized) STxB after various times of incubation. While preincubation for 30 min with 20 μM Retro-1 or Retro-2 clearly reduced subsequent transport of STxB to the TGN (see above), no effect on the internalization of STxB was detected under these conditions (Figure 3B), suggesting that both compounds do not exert their inhibitory effect by interfering with the cellular uptake of STxB. The biochemical data on the inhibition of STxB transport to the TGN by Retro-1 and Retro-2 was confirmed in immunofluorescence experiments (Figure 3C). Fluorophore-tagged STxB (red) was bound on ice to vehicle-treated control or compound-treated cells (conditions as above). After washing, cells were incubated for 45 min at 37°C. In control cells, STxB (red) accumulated in perinuclear membranes that were labeled by the Golgi marker giantin (green; Figure 3C, upper panel). In cells treated either with Retro-1 (Figure 3C, middle panel) or Retro-2 (Figure 3C, lower panel), STxB no longer colocalized with giantin but appeared in peripheral structures that were evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. These results confirmed that Retro-1 and Retro-2 block retrograde STxB transport to the TGN/Golgi. Figure 3C and Figure S3 document that Golgi morphology was not visibly affected by incubation of cells with Retro-1 or Retro-2, as judged by giantin labeling. The localization of the Golgi markers CTR433 and GM130 was also unchanged (Figure S3). Furthermore, we found that the morphologies of the ER, of early (EEA1) and recycling endosomes (transferrin receptor [TfR] and Rab11), and of late endosomes/lysosomes (Lamp1) were unaffected by the compounds. The specificity of Retro-1 and Retro-2 was further analyzed by measuring transport via a number of other routes that intersect with the early endosome-TGN interface: the biosynthetic/secretory, endocytic, and recycling pathways. These were analyzed in the presence of 20 μM of Retro-1 or Retro-2 (30 min pretreatment), conditions for which it was validated in parallel that STxB trafficking was strongly inhibited. As we have seen above, STxB endocytosis was not affected by Retro-1 or Retro-2 (Figure 3B). On the same cells, the endocytosis of biotinylated transferrin (Tf) was analyzed, with a similar approach to the one described for STxB. Neither Retro-1 nor Retro-2 affected the clathrin-dependent endocytic uptake of Tf (Figure 3D), indicating that this major cellular internalization route was still operating in the presence of the compounds. Tf was also used to measure recycling from early and recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane. After an uptake pulse, the quantity of remaining cell-associated Tf was determined in function of chase time at 37°C (Figure 3E). Again, neither Retro-1 nor Retro-2 had any effect. Targeting to the late endocytic pathway was analyzed with radiolabeled epidermal growth factor (EGF). In interaction with its receptor, EGF is targeted to late endosomes/lysosomes, where the protein is degraded. This trafficking from the plasma membrane into the degrading environment of the late endocytic pathway was not affected by Retro-1 or Retro-2 (Figure 3F). Finally, a thermosensitive vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein mutant fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP-VSVGts045) was used to assess the effect of Retro-1 and Retro-2 on anterograde transport along the biosynthetic/secretory pathway from the ER to the plasma membrane, via the Golgi apparatus and the TGN (Figure 3G). In these experiments, GFP-VSVGts045 protein accumulated in the ER at restrictive temperature (40°C) and was then chased at permissive temperature (32°C) for 2 hr. The level of GFP-VSVGts045 protein that reached the plasma membrane in vehicle-treated control cells was set to 100%. In the presence of brefeldin A, anterograde trafficking was totally inhibited, and the VSVG trafficking signal was at background levels, similar to cells that were kept at restricted temperature. Upon incubation with Retro-1 or Retro-2, GFP-VSVGts045 trafficking was not significantly affected (Figure 3G). Taken together, these results show that Retro-1 and Retro-2 have no effect on endocytosis, recycling, degradation, and secretion. The peripheral compartments in which STxB accumulated in Retro-1 and Retro-2-treated cells were further characterized (30 min pretreatment with compounds at 20 μM). A major overlap could be found between STxB (red) and TfR (green; Figures 4A and 4C ), a marker of early and recycling endosomes, and EEA1 (green; Figures 4B and 4D), a marker of early endosomes. In all these cases, 90% or 85% of TfR or EEA1-positive compartments were also labeled by STxB, respectively. In Retro-1- (Figure 4E) and Retro-2- (Figure 4F) treated cells, immunogold labeling on cryosections revealed the presence of STxB (15 nm gold particles) in tubular and vesicular structures that were also strongly labeled for TfR (10 nm gold particles), while in control (Ctr) cells, STxB efficiently accumulated in the Golgi cisternae (Figure S4A).Figure S4STxB Accumulates in Early Endosomes in Inhibitor Treated Cells, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Immunogold analysis.

Pharmacological inhibitors of the Rho pathway reportedly block angiogenesis; however, the molecular details of this inhibition are largely unknown. We demonstrate that vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) rapidly induces RhoA activation in endothelial cells (ECs). Moreover, the pharmacological inhibition of ROCK1/2 using 10 µM Y-27632 (the IC50 for this compound in ECs) strongly disrupts vasculogenesis in pluripotent embryonic stem cell cultures, VEGF-mediated regenerative angiogenesis in ex vivo retinal explants, and VEGF-mediated in vitro EC tube formation. Furthermore, using small interfering RNA knockdown and mouse heterozygote knockouts of ROCK1 and ROCK2, we provide data indicating that VEGF-driven angiogenesis is largely mediated through ROCK2. These data demonstrate that Rho/ROCK signaling is an important mediator in a number of angiogenic processes, including EC migration, survival, and cell permeability, and suggest that Rho/ROCK inhibition may prove useful for the treatment of angiogenesis-related disorders.—Bryan, B.

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the process of cancer stem cell (CSC) differentiation is not clearly understood. Recently, we reported the isolation of the epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) stem cells (type I/CD44+). In this study, we show that type I/CD44+ cells are characterized by low levels of both miR-199a and miR-214, whereas mature EOC cells (type II/CD44−) have higher levels of miR-199a and miR-214. Moreover, these two micro RNAs (miRNAs) are regulated as a cluster on pri-miR-199a2 within the human Dnm3os gene (GenBank FJ623959). This study identify Twist1 as a regulator of this unique miRNA cluster responsible for the regulation of the IKKβ/NF-κB and PTEN/AKT pathways and its association of ovarian CSC differentiation. Our data suggest that Twist1 may be an important regulator of ‘stemness’ in EOC cells. The regulation of MIR199A2/214 expression may be used as a potential therapeutic approach in EOC patients."

https://openalex.org/W1971046996,"Ever since Darwin's pioneering research, the evolution of self-fertilisation (selfing) has been regarded as one of the most prevalent evolutionary transitions in flowering plants. A major mechanism to prevent selfing is the self-incompatibility (SI) recognition system, which consists of male and female specificity genes at the S-locus and SI modifier genes. Under conditions that favour selfing, mutations disabling the male recognition component are predicted to enjoy a relative advantage over those disabling the female component, because male mutations would increase through both pollen and seeds whereas female mutations would increase only through seeds. Despite many studies on the genetic basis of loss of SI in the predominantly selfing plant Arabidopsis thaliana, it remains unknown whether selfing arose through mutations in the female specificity gene (S-receptor kinase, SRK), male specificity gene (S-locus cysteine-rich protein, SCR; also known as S-locus protein 11, SP11) or modifier genes, and whether any of them rose to high frequency across large geographic regions. Here we report that a disruptive 213-base-pair (bp) inversion in the SCR gene (or its derivative haplotypes with deletions encompassing the entire SCR-A and a large portion of SRK-A) is found in 95% of European accessions, which contrasts with the genome-wide pattern of polymorphism in European A. thaliana. Importantly, interspecific crossings using Arabidopsis halleri as a pollen donor reveal that some A. thaliana accessions, including Wei-1, retain the female SI reaction, suggesting that all female components including SRK are still functional. Moreover, when the 213-bp inversion in SCR was inverted and expressed in transgenic Wei-1 plants, the functional SCR restored the SI reaction. The inversion within SCR is the first mutation disrupting SI shown to be nearly fixed in geographically wide samples, and its prevalence is consistent with theoretical predictions regarding the evolutionary advantage of mutations in male components."
https://openalex.org/W2018207073,"Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) is ubiquitously expressed in cells. Phosphorylation of its multiple targets in response to various stimuli, including growth factors or cytokines, promotes cell survival and inhibits apoptosis. PKB is upregulated in many different cancers and a significant amount of the enzyme is present in its activated form. Here we show that PKB phosphorylates one of the anti-apoptotic proteins--transcription factor Twist-1 at Ser42. Cells expressing Twist-1 displayed inefficient p53 upregulation in response to DNA damage induced by gamma-irradiation or the genotoxic drug adriamycin. This influenced the activation of p53 target genes such as p21(Waf1) and Bax and led to aberrant cell-cycle regulation and the inhibition of apoptosis. The impaired induction of these p53 effector molecules is likely to be mediated by PKB-dependent phosphorylation of Twist-1 because, unlike the wild-type mutant, the Twist-1 S42A mutant did not confer cell resistance to DNA damage. Moreover, phosphorylation of Twist-1 at Ser42 was shown in vivo in various human cancer tissues, suggesting that this post-translational modification ensures functional activation of Twist-1 after promotion of survival during carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2086928559,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are nuclear transcription factors that play central roles in metabolism and inflammation. Although a variety of compounds have been shown to activate PPARs, identification of physiologically relevant ligands has proven difficult. In silico studies of lipid derivatives reported here identify specific 5-lipoxygenase products as candidate physiologically relevant PPAR-α activators. Subsequent studies show both in vitro and in a murine model of inflammation that 5-lipoxygenase stimulation induces PPAR-α signaling and that this results specifically from production of the inflammatory mediator and chemoattractant leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Activation of PPAR-α is a direct effect of intracellularly generated LTB4 binding to the nuclear receptor and not of secreted LTB4 acting via its cell-surface receptors. Activation of PPAR-α reduces secretion of LTB4 by stimulating degradation of this fatty acid derivative. We also show that the LTB4 precursors leukotriene A4 (LTA4) and 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetrenoic acid (5-HPETE) activate PPAR-α but have no significant endogenous effect independent of conversion to LTB4.

PPAR-α in particular regulates many aspects of lipid metabolism, including some aspects of plasma lipoprotein metabolism as well as fatty acid uptake, intracellular transport, and energy-generating metabolism. A further role for PPAR-α as a modulator of inflammation is supported by several lines of evidence (2.Youssef J. Badr M. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2004; 2004: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), including the greater severity or duration of inflammation in PPAR-α knock-out mice (3.Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M.

Numerous synthetic agonists for the various PPARs have been developed. The PPAR-γ-activating thiazolidinediones are used clinically as insulin-sensitizing agents in type 2 diabetes, whereas the PPAR-α-activating fibrates are used as lipid-lowering agents. Endogenous compounds also bind to PPARs, yet unambiguous identification of physiologically important ligands has proven difficult. Most endogenous PPAR ligands identified to date either exhibit relatively low affinity or are present in low concentrations, and, in either case, appear unlikely to be important activators in vivo. For example, although 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) was found to be a high affinity ligand for PPAR-γ (6.Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2701) Google Scholar), further investigation has shown that concentrations are low and that 15d-PGJ2 is unlikely to play a significant physiological role (7.Bell-Parikh L.C. Ide T. Lawson J.A. McNamara P. Reilly M. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 945-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Likewise, a recent study has demonstrated that differentiating preadipocytes produce a PPAR-γ agonist essential for the differentiation process (8.Tzameli I. Fang H. Ollero M. Shi H. Hamm J.K. Kievit P. Hollenberg A.N. Flier J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36093-36102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), thus providing unambiguous evidence for the existence of an endogenous ligand. Nevertheless, the investigators were unable to isolate and identify the ligand. Endogenous lipid-derived compounds have likewise been identified as activating ligands for PPAR-α. As with early studies of 15d-PGJ2, however, until recently, all studies of these compounds have employed exogenous addition of the compound being investigated. The in vivo relevance of these ligands thus remains unclear, as their ability to activate PPAR-α under physiologically relevant conditions has never been demonstrated. The phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine was shown recently to activate PPAR-α in liver but, as that study's authors note, its relevance to other tissues or cell types remains uncertain (9.Chakravarthy M.V.

To determine the physiologically relevant PPAR-α ligand in cells of the immune system, we used in silico methods to identify lipid-derived compounds that bind strongly to the PPAR-α activation site. As we found that the most strongly binding compounds were products of 5-lipoxygenase action on arachidonic acid, we chose to further investigate this system. Involvement of 5-lipoxygenase in endogenous PPAR-α activation is plausible because this enzyme produces leukotrienes and related eicosanoids that play important roles as inflammatory mediators and chemoattractants (10.Peters-Golden M. Henderson Jr., W.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357: 1841-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar) and because exogenously added eicosanoids have been shown to activate PPAR-α (3.Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 11.Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The results we report here demonstrate that PPAR-α in cells of the immune system is activated in a physiologically relevant manner by a lipid quite different from the one active in hepatocytes. They also support the emerging concept that LTB4 plays a central role in the regulation of inflammation through its ability to exert both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects via different receptors.

Lipids supplied in ethanol were evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen and immediately resuspended with DMSO (purged with inert gas) at a concentration of 10 mm. Stocks were stored at −30 °C until use. Rabbit polyclonal 5-lipoxygenase antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); rabbit polyclonal PPAR-α (H-98), goat polyclonal LTA4 hydrolase (C-21), and β-actin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Gal4-PPAR plasmids were a kind gift from Ron Evans (Salk Institute), the aP2-luc plasmid was from Todd Leff (Wayne State University), and the CMX-PPAR-α plasmid was from Kirin Brewery Co., Ltd. 5-Lipoxygenase knock-out (129-Alox5tm1Fun) and strain-matched wild-type sv129 mice were bred in the University of Michigan Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine from breeders obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). All experiments were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals. RBL-2H3, CV-1, HeLa, and Jurkat T cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), grown in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. In all transfection experiments, cells were transiently cotransfected with pRL-SV40 and reporter plasmids with or without expression plasmids. In separate experiments, cells were cotransfected with pRL-SV40 plus a luciferase gene under the control of four Gal4 DNA-binding elements (UASG × 4 TK-luciferase) and a plasmid containing the ligand-binding domain for a PPAR fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 or Amaxa Nucleofector (Walkersville, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were treated with test compounds and incubated for an additional 24 h in medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The resulting luciferase activity was measured with reporter luciferase assay kits (Promega; Madison, WI) employing a Modulus 9201 luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnydale, CA) and normalized by comparison to Renilla luciferase. Human peripheral blood PMNs were obtained from heparinized venous blood of healthy volunteers by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and sedimentation in 5% dextran according to a protocol approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board for Human Subject Research. This method yielded ∼2 × 106 cells/ml, with PMNs representing >95% of the cells isolated. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 20 mg/kg body weight of E. coli LPS or vehicle. Four h after injection, the mice were euthanized, and the peritoneal cavity was opened and rinsed with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Total cell counts were performed, and cells were pelleted by centrifugation. Immediately following peritoneal lavage, liver tissue was excised and processed. Nuclear protein was isolated using a nuclear protein extraction kit (Cayman Chemicals). Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) DC protein assay. PPAR-α DNA-binding activity in the nuclear protein was detected by an ELISA-based PPAR-α transcription factor assay (Cayman Chemicals) that detects PPAR-α bound to PPAR response element-containing double-stranded DNA sequences. SMARTpool siRNA reagents, along with nonspecific negative control pool siRNAs, were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Transfection of these pooled 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000. Zymosan particles (Sigma Aldrich) were boiled in serum-free medium for 10 min and washed twice with the same medium. The particles were then resuspended in serum-free medium and counted with a Coulter counter. Isolated PMNs (2 × 106 in 250 μl culture medium) were incubated with 5 × 108 zymosan particles for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells (2 × 106) were cultured in medium and treated with compounds. Supernatants were collected, and immunoreactive LTB4 was quantitated by ELISA (Cayman Chemical) following the manufacturer's instructions. LTB4 in peritoneal lavage fluid was quantitated similarly. The detection limit for LTB4 was 4 pg/ml; cross-reactivity for arachidonic acid, 5-HETE, LTC4, LTD4, or LTE4 was <0.01%. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer, mixed with a commercial sample buffer (Invitrogen), and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were then electrophoresed on 4–20% Tris-glycine Novex SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), after which the gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45 μm). Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody, followed by appropriate secondary antibody. They were then washed and signal detected using a SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate Western blotting reagent (Pierce Biotechnology) with chemiluminescence-sensitive film. The compounds of interest were sketched and converted into three-dimensional structures using the program Sybyl (Tripos; St. Louis, MO). Minimization for these compounds employed 1000 steps utilizing the steepest-descents method followed by conjugate gradients and finally BFGS method up to a gradient of 0.01 kcal/mol/Å. Docking of pterostilbene analogs was performed in the PPAR-α ligand-binding domain (Protein Data Bank code 1K7L). Protein preparation was done using the program Discovery Studio (version 2.1) (Accelrys; San Diego, CA), which involved addition of hydrogen atoms, minimization of the protein, and assigning of formal charges to the amino acid residues. The x-ray crystal bound pose of GW409544 was used to define the binding site during protein preparation. Docking of the compounds was performed using the program GOLD (Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre; Cambridge, UK). The binding site for docking was defined using all amino acid residues within 12 Å. The “standard mode” settings were used, and no artificial restraints were defined during docking. The “early termination” criterion was set to off. For each compound, a total of 10 different docking poses were collected. The GOLD scoring function was used to identify docking poses and to rank these poses. The various docking poses of each compound were visually inspected for anticipated ligand-receptor interactions and unreasonable conformations. Jurkat T cells were transfected with the human PPAR-α expression plasmid or control vector. Cells were then changed to Hanks' balanced salt solution (with calcium and magnesium) and stimulated with A23187 or control for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml chilled methanol to the cells followed by incubation for 1 h at 0 °C. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 10 min and diluted with HPLC grade water to bring the methanol concentration to 15%. Extraction of LTB4 metabolites and their separation and quantification was done according to the method of Christmas et al. (14.Christmas P. Tolentino K. Primo V. Berry K.Z. Murphy R.C. Chen M. Lee D.M. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7189-7196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, diluted supernatants were passed through a solid phase extraction cartridge (C-18 Sep-Pak column, 1 cc, 100 mg, Waters), eluted with 1 ml of methanol, and evaporated under inert nitrogen gas at room temperature. The dried substance was immediately suspended in an HPLC mobile phase, and peaks were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Data are represented as mean ± S.E. and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5.01 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Comparisons among experimental groups were performed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett's adjustment for multiple comparisons or Student's t test as applicable. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. A number of lipid-derived compounds, especially arachidonic acid derivatives, have been shown to activate PPAR-α when added exogenously at high concentrations. Although these compounds may be present endogenously, previous studies have not established the physiological relevance of any outside hepatocytes. As a first step toward identifying physiologically relevant endogenous PPAR-α ligands, we performed molecular docking studies in silico. As shown in Table 1, strong binding was observed for LTB4, 20-hydroxy-LTB4 (20-OH-LTB4), LTE4, LTA4, 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), and to a lesser extent 5-oxoeicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE). Other tested compounds demonstrated either weak or absent binding (Table 1 and data not shown). Previous studies have established that typical PPAR-α agonists form hydrogen bonds to Ser-280, Tyr-314, His-440, and Tyr-464 of the receptor (15.Cronet P. Petersen J.F. Folmer R. Blomberg N. Sjöblom K. Karlsson U. Lindstedt E.L. Bamberg K. Structure. 2001; 9: 699-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 16.Zoete V. Grosdidier A. Michielin O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and that these hydrogen bonds are necessary for receptor activation. Both LTB4 and the potent synthetic PPAR-α agonist Wy 14643 form hydrogen bonds with these four receptor residues (Table 1 and Fig. 1). LTB4 forms an additional hydrogen bond to Cys-276, which is not essential for receptor activation. These four important hydrogen bonds are also observed on docking of 20-OH-LTB4 and 5-HPETE, although the binding energies (docking scores) for these two compounds are somewhat less than those for LTB4 and Wy 14643 (Table 1). By contrast, the hydrogen bonds formed by LTE4 (Met-220, Leu-331, Glu-286, and Gly-335), LTA4 (Tyr-334, Glu-286, and Met-220) and 5-oxo-ETE (Met-220, Asn-219, and Glu-286) are not those recognized as important for receptor activation. Notably, in silico binding of LTB4 (Fig. 1B) is similar to that of Wy 14643 (Fig. 1A). Indeed, in silico docking poses of the two compounds are almost superimposable (Fig. 1D). 5-HPETE also binds in a very similar manner (Fig. 1C). Consequently, LTB4 and 5-HPETE may be viewed as plausible candidate endogenous activators.TABLE 1Docking score and key interacting residues of PPAR-α with 5-lipoxygenase compoundsCompound nameDocking scoreInteractive residueskcal/molWy 14643−7.771Ser-280, Tyr-314, Tyr-464, and His-440LTB4−7.803Ser-280, Tyr-314, Tyr-464, His-440, and Cys-27620-OH-LTB4−6.041Ser-280, Tyr-314, Tyr-464, His-440, and Cys-2765-HPETE−5.903Ser-280, Tyr-314, Tyr-464, and His-440LTE4−6.288Met-220, Leu-331, Glu-286, and Gly-335LTA4−6.240Tyr-334, Glu-286, and Met-2205-oxo-ETE−4.535Met-220, Asn-219, and Glu-286LTC4No poseLTD4No pose5-HETENo pose12-oxo-LTB4No pose Open table in a new tab Studies of nuclear receptor activation traditionally involve addition of exogenous ligand either to cells or to isolated receptor molecules. Such studies provide no information about the amount of ligand present at the receptor site in vivo and whether it is adequate to induce effective activation. By contrast, generation of an activating ligand within the cell under physiological conditions clearly establishes its relevance. Since all of the compounds that demonstrated strong binding and relevant hydrogen bond formation in silico are products of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (17.Murphy R.C. Gijón M.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 379-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), which is activated by a variety of proinflammatory stimuli through mechanisms dependent on an influx of extracellular Ca2+ (18.Wong A. Cook M.N. Foley J.J. Sarau H.M. Marshall P. Hwang S.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9346-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this enzyme might generate a physiologically relevant ligand. In initial studies, we activated 5-lipoxygenase through addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Activation of PPAR-α was assessed by a Gal4-luciferase reporter in conjunction with a chimeric protein having the PPAR-α ligand binding domain fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Plasmids coding for these proteins were transfected into Jurkat T cells (Fig. 2A), which constitutively express 5-lipoxygenase. PPAR-α was activated ∼7-fold by A23187 and to a similar level by the potent synthetic PPAR-α agonist Wy 14643 as a positive control. Similar studies with PPAR-γ or PPAR-β/δ reporters demonstrated no activation (Fig. 2B). Because A23187-stimulated Ca2+ influx can affect a number of different signaling pathways, we employed the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton as a probe for the specific role of this enzyme in the observed increase in PPAR-α activity. As hypothesized, zileuton treatment produced a significant, dose-dependent reduction in PPAR-α activation (Fig. 2A). To demonstrate conclusively that 5-lipoxygenase is essential for PPAR-α activation, we also carried out studies in cells (CV-1) that lack native 5-lipoxygenase (Fig. 2C). Stimulation with the Ca2+ ionophore did not activate PPAR-α in these cells unless they were transfected with a 5-lipoxygenase expression plasmid. To confirm that the 5-lipoxygenase product not only binds to but functionally activates PPAR-α, we studied binding of activated receptor to PPAR response elements. We transfected RBL-2H3 cells, which lack native PPAR-α, with plasmids containing luciferase under control of PPAR response elements. Stimulation with A23187 induced luciferase activity only in the presence of PPAR-α expression and not in native cells (Fig. 2D). In additional studies, PPAR-α-transfected cells were treated with zileuton then stimulated with A23187. Zileuton effectively inhibited A23187-induced PPAR-α activation (data not shown). To determine the specific identity of the 5-lipoxygenase product that activates PPAR-α in vitro, we investigated the ability of candidate compounds to activate PPAR-α in CV-1 cells transfected with a Gal4-luciferase PPAR-α reporter system. PPAR-α activity was increased significantly by LTA4, LTB4, and 5-HPETE but not by arachidonic acid, LTC4, LTD4, LTE4, 5-HETE, or 5-oxo-ETE (Fig. 3A). 5-HPETE, LTA4, and LTB4 are thus activating ligands of PPAR-α, although these results with exogenously added compound do not establish physiological relevance. Most LTB4 is secreted into surrounding medium or tissues, where it activates cell-surface BLT1 or BLT2 receptors on adjacent cells. To eliminate the possibility that PPAR-α activation was an indirect result of such effects, studies were repeated using HeLa cells, which lack such cell-surface receptors (19.Pettersson A. Boketoft A. Sabirsh A. Nilsson N.E. Kotarsky K. Olde B. Owman C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20.Sabirsh A. Bristulf J. Owman C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 499: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Treatment of HeLa cells with LTB4 activated PPAR-α in a manner identical to that seen in CV-1 cells and was dose-dependent in the range of 1–20 μm (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, activation of PPAR-α was also seen following treatment with LTA4, although this compound did not form the hydrogen bonds considered essential for the effect. Furthermore, the extent of activation was greater than that following treatment with an equimolar concentration of LTB4 (Fig. 3A). Because LTA4 is converted to LTB4 by LTA4 hydrolase, we tested the effect on PPAR-α activation of LTA4 hydrolase inhibitors. Surprisingly, the commonly employed LTA4 hydrolase inhibitor bestatin had no effect on PPAR-α activation by LTA4 (Fig. 3C). Further study showed that this reflected failure of bestatin to traverse the cellular membrane (data not shown). By contrast, LTA4-induced activation was completely inhibited by the cell-permeable inhibitor SC22716 (Fig. 3C). We next sought to show that LTB4 is the specific endogenous product that activates PPAR-α following 5-lipoxygenase stimulation. We therefore tested the effects of SC22716 on Ca2+ ionophore-induced PPAR-α activation. Jurkat T cells transfected with the Gal4-luciferase PPAR-α reporter system were treated with SC22716 and stimulated with A23187. Inhibition of LTA4 hydrolase abolished the stimulatory effects of ionophore treatment (Fig. 3D), thus demonstrating that the 5-lipoxygenase product involved in PPAR-α activation is specifically LTB4. To eliminate the possibility that SC22716 was acting through off-target mechanisms, we silenced LTA4 hydrolase by transfection with targeted LTA4 siRNA. LTA4 hydrolase silencing, like enzyme inhibition, inhibited PPAR-α activation following stimulation with A23187 (Fig. 3D). These results reinforce the conclusion that LTB4 is the only effective activating ligand within the cell and that 5-HPETE, although capable of activating PPAR-α when added exogenously at high concentrations, has little effect under intracellular conditions. To demonstrate relevance in more physiological settings, studies were carried out using PMNs isolated from human blood. In some of these studies, cells were stimulated with opsonized zymosan (21.Claesson H.E. Lundberg U. Malmsten C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 1230-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) rather than A23187. Both stimuli induced PPAR-α activation in these cells (Fig. 4A), whereas both zileuton and SC22716 inhibited activation. These results confirm the identity of LTB4 as the relevant PPAR-α activator in primary cells exposed to physiological as well as pharmacological stimuli. Because inflammation is the primary stimulus for LTB4 production in vivo, we hypothesized that inflammation would lead to PPAR-α activation in a 5-lipoxygenase-dependent manner. To test this hypothesis, we induced inflammation in wild-type and 5-lipoxygenase knock-out mice by intraperitoneal injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Four hours later, the mice were euthanized, fluid from peritoneal lavage was collected, and liver tissue was excised. Lavage fluid from wild-type but not 5-lipoxygenase knock-out mice demonstrated increased LTB4 concentrations (Fig. 4B, inset). In both liver tissue and the cellular fraction of peritoneal lavage fluid, LPS treatment increased PPAR-α activity in wild-type but not 5-lipoxygenase knock-out mice (Fig. 4B). Thus, in vivo as in vitro, a 5-lipoxygenase product is essential for inflammation-induced increases in PPAR-α activity. Because PPAR-α induces enzymes involved in lipid degradation, including that of LTB4 (22.Hashimoto T. Cook W.S. Qi C. Yeldandi A.V. Reddy J.K. Rao M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28918-28928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), it is plausible that PPAR-α activation may reduce net production of LTB4 following cell stimulation. To determine whether secretion of LTB4 is altered when PPAR-α is activated by endogenously produced LTB4, we transfected Jurkat T cells with PPAR-α expression plasmids and then stimulated them with A23187 as before. Secretion of LTB4 was significantly lower in the presence than in the absence of PPAR-α overexpression (Fig. 5A). To further confirm that this decrease in LTB4 secretion results from PPAR-α activity, we also knocked down endogenous PPAR-α using siRNA. PPAR-α knockdown significantly increased secretion of LTB4 (Fig. 5A). To confirm the hypothesis that the PPAR-α-induced decrease in LTB4 results at least in part from increased degradation, we transfected Jurkat T cells with PPAR-α, stimulated them with A23187, and measured the relative concentration of the first LTB4 degradation product, 20-OH-LTB4, using LC-MS/MS (14.Christmas P. Tolentino K. Primo V. Berry K.Z. Murphy R.C. Chen M. Lee D.M. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7189-7196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PPAR-α transfection increased the relative concentration of 20-OH-LTB4 significantly (Fig. 5, B and C). The identity of 20-OH-LTB4 was confirmed by MS of the putative peak (Fig. 5B). It follows that in cells expressing PPAR-α, production of LTB4 is to some extent self-limiting due to enhanced degradation of the product. Identification of physiologically relevant PPAR agonists has proven unexpectedly difficult. PPARs were initially identified as “orphan” receptors because no endogenous ligands were known. Improved screening methods have allowed identification of compounds that bind to and activate each of the three PPAR isoforms. Which, if any, of these compounds are important for activation of their target receptor(s) in vivo remains unclear, however. Many of the identified agonists either are low affinity ligands or exhibit intracellular concentrations that may be low or unknown. There has been only one previous instance in which any PPAR has been activated by an identified agonist generated specifically within the target cell. Here, we demonstrate conclusively that, in cells possessing the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, stimulation of the activity of the enzyme leads to activation of PPAR-α via production of intracellular LTB4. The ability of LTB4 to act as a PPAR-α agonist has been reported previously (3.Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar, 12.Krey G. Braissant O. L'Horset F. Kalkhoven E. Perroud M. Parker M.G. Wahli W. Mol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) but has also been disputed (11.Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). Our results with CV-1 cells, however, directly contradict the report of Forman and colleagues (11.Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar) that LTB4 does not activate PPAR-α in these cells. Activation by a variety of other eicosanoids (11.Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar, 23.Ng V.Y. Huang Y. Reddy L.M. Falck J.R. Lin E.T. Kroetz D.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 35: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), including a novel 15-lipoxygenase product (24.Kozak K.R. Gupta R.A. Moody J.S. Ji C. Boeglin W.E. DuBois R.N. Brash A.R. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23278-23286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), has also been reported. All of these studies, however, were carried out with exogenously added compounds and provide little evidence as to whether identified agonists are present intracellularly in concentrations and locations adequate for physiologically meaningful activation. As the example of the PPAR-γ ligand 15d-PGJ2 shows, studies with exogenous ligands can prove irrelevant physiologically. Our results with LTA4 and 5-HPETE also highlight how easily results with exogenously added putative ligands could be misinterpreted in the absence of rigorous investigation of their endogenous roles. Both of these compounds, when added exogenously, are highly effective PPAR-α activators. In the case of LTA4, this is due exclusively to its subsequent conversion to LTB4. In the case of 5-HPETE, the inability of 5-lipoxygenase stimulation to activate the receptor when LTA4 hydrolase is removed indicates that this 5-lipoxygenase metabolite is not present at sufficient intracellular concentrations or locations to play a significant physiological role. By contrast, we demonstrate that LTB4 directly activates PPAR-α under conditions typically analogous to those encountered by cells of the immune system in vivo. We further extend and confirm these findings by showing that inflammatory conditions stimulating LTB4 production in vivo also up-regulate PPAR-α activity. Surprisingly, LTB4 does not appear to be the only physiologically relevant ligand in the body. Observations have demonstrated that liver PPAR-α is activated by the phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (9.Chakravarthy M.V. Lodhi I.J. Yin L. Malapaka R.R. Xu H.E. Turk J. Semenkovich C.F. Cell. 2009; 138: 476-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Concentrations of this compound vary with activity of fatty acid synthase in a way that is physiologically relevant to PPAR-α regulation of lipid metabolism in this organ. Although neither we nor Chakravarthy and colleagues (9.Chakravarthy M.V. Lodhi I.J. Yin L. Malapaka R.R. Xu H.E. Turk J. Semenkovich C.F. Cell. 2009; 138: 476-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) specifically identified the cell types involved, it is likely that the phospholipid activator is primarily relevant to hepatocytes, whereas our results may be dominated by Kupffer cells, mononuclear phagocytes found in the liver. In combination, these data suggest that functionally distinct cell types may have different PPAR-α ligands, each physiologically relevant to the specific function of the cell. One may speculate that the same will prove to be true of other PPARs as well. It should also not be assumed that LTB4 and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine are the only physiologically relevant PPAR-α ligands. Chakravarthy and colleagues (9.Chakravarthy M.V. Lodhi I.J. Yin L. Malapaka R.R. Xu H.E. Turk J. Semenkovich C.F. Cell. 2009; 138: 476-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) not only raise the possibility of tissue-specific ligands regulating inflammation, as we have now shown to be the case, but also suggest that the specific phospholipid they have identified is unlikely to be physiologically relevant in brain. It is thus likely that there is at least one, and perhaps several, additional PPAR-α ligands that are physiologically relevant in different tissues. In addition to showing that LTB4 is a physiologically relevant PPAR-α ligand, we also demonstrate that secretion of this compound is decreased by the presence of activated PPAR-α and that this effect is accompanied by increased levels of LTB4 metabolic breakdown products. Breakdown of LTB4 typically involves ω-oxidation by specific cytochrome P450s, followed by β-oxidation usual for long-chain fatty acids, with enzymes essential for both portions of this pathway subject to PPAR-α induction (22.Hashimoto T. Cook W.S. Qi C. Yeldandi A.V. Reddy J.K. Rao M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28918-28928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). These considerations led Devchand and colleagues (3.Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar) to propose that LTB4, via activation of PPAR-α, stimulated its own breakdown and hence contributed to the resolution of inflammation. Their finding that the duration of inflammation was increased in PPAR-α knock-out mice reinforces this suggestion, which draws further support from our observation. Fiedler and colleagues (25.Fiedler J. Simon F.R. Iwahashi M. Murphy R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 691-697PubMed Google Scholar), however, reported that LTB4 did not stimulate LTB4 catabolism in isolated rat hepatocytes. This may be accounted for by the observed failure of LTB4 to up-regulate CYP4Fs, the cytochrome P450s primarily responsible for LTB4 metabolism in these cells (26.Kalsotra A. Anakk S. Brommer C.L. Kikuta Y. Morgan E.T. Strobel H.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 461: 104-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because hepatocytes do not synthesize LTB4 and are therefore exposed only to the exogenous lipid (27.Leier I. Müller M. Jedlitschky G. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), differences in cytochrome P450 induction mechanisms are not implausible. Youseff and Badr (2.Youssef J. Badr M. J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2004; 2004: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) also questioned the importance of LTB4 degradation in the anti-inflammatory properties of PPAR-α, as they observed that attenuation of rat paw edema by PPAR-α agonists was rapid and therefore unlikely to reflect transcription of oxidative enzymes. This in vivo system is complex, however; and it is likely that PPAR-α acts by several different mechanisms. The possible predominance of transcription-independent mechanisms in this model does not rule out the importance of transcriptional mechanisms in other settings. Inflammation is a finely balanced process that must be stimulated when required to combat infection or other insults, yet limited and resolved when it is no longer needed. Given the importance of LTB4 in the inflammatory process (28.Crooks S.W. Stockley R.A. Int. J. Biochem.

LTB4 may exert different effects in different immune and inflammatory cells capable of its synthesis. Notably, PPAR-α is absent from alveolar macrophages, often the first cells exposed in the lung to inhaled foreign antigens and therefore important for initiation of the inflammatory process. Given this crucial early role of macrophages, it is appropriate that there is no balancing anti-inflammatory LTB4 activity. In summary, we show that LTB4, which exerts proinflammatory effects via cell-surface receptors, is also responsible for activating the anti-inflammatory nuclear transcription factor PPAR-α following stimulation of its intracellular production. As a quite different lipid has been shown to activate PPAR-α under conditions that are physiologically relevant to hepatocytes, this strongly suggests that PPARs in general may have alternative ligands in functionally different cell types. We also show that activation of PPAR-α results in reduced secretion of LTB4. This suggests an important homeostatic mechanism by which a crucial proinflammatory mediator ultimately limits its own activity and thus facilitates resolution of the inflammatory process.

https://openalex.org/W1988437045,"Dedicated neuronal circuits enable animals to engage in specific behavioral responses to environmental stimuli. We found that hypoxic stress enhanced gustatory sensory perception via previously unknown circuitry in Caenorhabditis elegans. The hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 upregulated serotonin (5-HT) expression in specific sensory neurons that are not normally required for chemosensation. 5-HT subsequently promoted hypoxia-enhanced sensory perception by signaling through the metabotropic G protein-coupled receptor SER-7 in an unusual peripheral neuron, the M4 motor neuron. M4 relayed this information back into the CNS via the FMRFamide-related neuropeptide FLP-21 and its cognate receptor, NPR-1. Thus, physiological detection of hypoxia results in the activation of an additional, previously unrecognized circuit for processing sensory information that is not required for sensory processing under normoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2093264555,"One oscillation of Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity, largely driven by periodic synthesis and destruction of cyclins, is tightly coupled to a single complete eukaryotic cell division cycle. Tight linkage of different steps in diverse cell-cycle processes to Cdk activity has been proposed to explain this coupling. Here, we demonstrate an intrinsically oscillatory module controlling nucleolar release and resequestration of the Cdc14 phosphatase, which is essential for mitotic exit in budding yeast. We find that this Cdc14 release oscillator functions at constant and physiological cyclin-Cdk levels, and is therefore independent of the Cdk oscillator. However, the frequency of the release oscillator is regulated by cyclin-Cdk activity. This observation together with its mechanism suggests that the intrinsically autonomous Cdc14 release cycles are locked at once-per-cell-cycle through entrainment by the Cdk oscillator in wild-type cells. This concept may have broad implications for the structure and evolution of eukaryotic cell-cycle control."

We have earlier shown that ovarian cancer ascites induces Akt activation and protect tumor cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which ascites activates Akt. The ability of ovarian cancer ascites to activate Akt and inhibit TRAIL-induced cell death and caspase activity was decreased by heat inactivation, but was retained in ascites fractions >5 kDa. The survival promoting activity of ascites was not affected by inhibitors of growth factor receptor including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), VEGFR, FGFR, Her2/neu, and IGF-R1. However, this activity was inhibited by an αvβ5 integrin-blocking antibody, but not by blocking antibodies against αvβ3, β1, or β3 integrins. αvβ5 integrin-blocking antibodies also inhibited ascites-induced Akt phosphorylation and c-FLIPs up-regulation. Ovarian cancer ascites induced a rapid phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which closely correlated with the phosphorylation of Akt overtime. FAK phosphorylation was strongly inhibited by αvβ5 integrin-blocking antibodies. Depletion of FAK content by RNA interference was also associated with inhibition of ascites-mediated Akt activation and survival. These results suggest that ovarian cancer ascites induces FAK and Akt activation in an αvβ5 integrin-dependent pathway, which confers protection from TRAIL-induced cell death and caspase activation."

We have generated calnexin gene-deficient mice (cnx(-/-)) and showed that calnexin deficiency leads to myelinopathy. Calnexin-deficient mice were viable with no discernible effects on other systems, including immune function, and instead they demonstrated dysmyelination as documented by reduced conductive velocity of nerve fibers and electron microscopy analysis of sciatic nerve and spinal cord. Myelin of the peripheral and central nervous systems of cnx(-/-) mice was disorganized and decompacted.

https://openalex.org/W1972021734,"The ETS protein TEL, a transcriptional repressor, contains a PNT domain that, as an isolated fragment in vitro, self-associates to form a head-to-tail polymer. How such polymerization might affect the DNA-binding properties of full-length TEL is unclear. Here we report that monomeric TEL binds to a consensus ETS site with unusually low affinity (K(d) = 2.8 x 10(-8) M). A deletion analysis demonstrated that the low affinity was caused by a C-terminal inhibitory domain (CID) that attenuates DNA binding by approximately 10-fold. An NMR spectroscopically derived structure of a TEL fragment, deposited in the Protein Data Bank, revealed that the CID consists of two alpha-helices, one of which appears to block the DNA binding surface of the TEL ETS domain. Based on this structure, we substituted two conserved glutamic acids (Glu-431 and Glu-434) with alanines and found that this activated DNA binding and enhanced trypsin sensitivity in the CID. We propose that TEL displays a conformational equilibrium between inhibited and activated states and that electrostatic interactions involving these negatively charged residues play a role in stabilizing the inhibited conformation. Using a TEL dimer as a model polymer, we show that self-association facilitates cooperative binding to DNA. Cooperativity was observed on DNA duplexes containing tandem consensus ETS sites at variable spacing and orientations, suggesting flexibility in the region of TEL linking its self-associating PNT domain and DNA-binding ETS domain. We speculate that TEL compensates for the low affinity, which is caused by autoinhibition, by binding to DNA as a cooperative polymer."

Several CK2 inhibitors have been developed showing variable efficiency, emphasizing the need to expand the chemical diversity of those inhibitors. We report the identification and characterization of 2,8-difurandicarboxylic acid derivatives as a new class of nanomolar ATP-competitive inhibitors. Selectivity profiling pointed out proviral insertion Moloney virus kinases (Pim kinases) as the only other kinases that are significantly inhibited. By combining structure-activity relationship analysis with structural determination, we were able to determine the binding mode of these inhibitors for both kinases and to explain their strong inhibitory potency. Essential chemical features necessary for activity on both kinases were then identified. The described compounds are not cell permeable: however, they could provide a lead for developing novel inhibitors usable also in vivo. Given the similar but not redundant pathophysiological functions of CK2 and Pim family members, such inhibitors would provide new attractive leads for targeted cancer therapy.

https://openalex.org/W1677665692,"Arenavirus and bunyavirus RNA genomes are unusual in that they are found in circular nucleocapsids, presumably due to the annealing of their complementary terminal sequences. Moreover, arenavirus genome synthesis initiates with GTP at position +2 of the template rather than at the precise 3' end (position +1). After formation of a dinucleotide, 5' pppGpC(OH) is then realigned on the template before this primer is extended. The net result of this ""prime and realign"" mechanism of genome initiation is that 5' pppG is found as an unpaired 5' nucleotide when the complementary genome ends anneal to form a double-stranded (dsRNA) panhandle. Using 5' pppRNA made in vitro and purified so that all dsRNA side products are absent, we have determined that both this 5' nucleotide overhang, as well as mismatches within the dsRNA (as found in some arenavirus genomes), clearly reduce the ability of these model dsRNAs to induce interferon upon transfection into cells. The presence of this unpaired 5' ppp-nucleotide is thus another way that some viruses appear to use to avoid detection by cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors."

Expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the visual cortex is reduced in these situations. We asked whether neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor, type 2 (TrkB) regulates cortical visual acuity in adult mice. We found that genetically interfering with TrkB/BDNF signaling in pyramidal cells in the mature visual cortex reduced synaptic strength and resulted in a loss of neural responses to high spatial-frequency stimuli. Responses to low spatial-frequency stimuli were unaffected. This selective loss was not accompanied by a change in receptive field sizes or plasticity, but apparent contrast was reduced. Our results indicate that a dependence on spatial frequency in the Heeger normalization model explains this selective effect of contrast reduction on high-resolution vision and suggest that it involves contrast gain control operating in the visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2141687986,"Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders and are linked with the conversion of the cellular isoform of the prion protein (PrPc) into the abnormal β-sheet-rich isoform. It is widely accepted that the soluble oligomers of β-PrP are neurotoxic and that they are more pathologically significant. To unravel the molecular mechanism under the conversion process, it is critical to identify the factors that can promote the conversion from PrPc to the β-oligomers. By recording circular dichroism spectra and performing a size-exclusion HPLC assay, we found that the conformation of the recombinant human prion protein (rPrPc) was converted from an α-helical conformation into β-sheet oligomers under a macromolecular crowding condition. The soluble β-oligomers of rPrP were resistant to proteinase K digestion and could bind to the dyes thioflavin T and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate. Furthermore, by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay, we showed that the soluble β-oligomers were neurotoxic.

https://openalex.org/W1998730409,"Deposition of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) as islet amyloid in type 2 diabetes contributes to loss of beta-cell function and mass, yet the mechanism for its occurrence is unclear. Neprilysin is a metallopeptidase known to degrade amyloid in Alzheimer disease. We previously demonstrated neprilysin to be present in pancreatic islets and now sought to determine whether it plays a role in degrading islet amyloid. We used an in vitro model where cultured human IAPP (hIAPP) transgenic mouse islets develop amyloid and thereby have increased beta-cell apoptosis. Islet neprilysin activity was inhibited or up-regulated using a specific inhibitor or adenovirus encoding neprilysin, respectively. Following neprilysin inhibition, islet amyloid deposition and beta-cell apoptosis increased by 54 and 75%, respectively, whereas when neprilysin was up-regulated islet amyloid deposition and beta-cell apoptosis both decreased by 79%. To determine if neprilysin modulated amyloid deposition by cleaving hIAPP, analysis of hIAPP incubated with neprilysin was performed by mass spectrometry, which failed to demonstrate neprilysin-induced cleavage. Rather, neprilysin may act by reducing hIAPP fibrillogenesis, which we showed to be the case by fluorescence-based thioflavin T binding studies and electron microscopy. In summary, neprilysin decreases islet amyloid deposition by inhibiting hIAPP fibril formation, rather than degrading hIAPP. These findings suggest that targeting the role of neprilysin in IAPP fibril assembly, in addition to IAPP cleavage by other peptidases, may provide a novel approach to reduce and/or prevent islet amyloid deposition in type 2 diabetes."

Fli-I binds to NRX and other related proteins, such as Rod-derived cone viability factor (RdCVF), whereas Dvl binds only to NRX. Endogenous NRX and Fli-I in vivo interactions are confirmed. Both NRX and RdCVF link Fli-I with myeloid differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88), an important adaptor protein for innate immune response.

Consistently, overexpression of constitutively active mutant PAK1 (T423E) helps develop malignant mammary tumors in a transgenic mouse model (29Wang R.A. Zhang H. Balasenthil S. Medina D. Kumar R. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 2931-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PAK1 plays a key role in carcinogenesis and cancer metastasis. Here, we present evidence that LKB1 inhibits cell motility and PAK1-mediated signaling through direct phosphorylation of PAK1 at Thr109 in the p21-binding domain. HCT116 cells and HEK293T cells were maintained in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWest, Nuaillé, France), and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin. Construction of Lkb1 knock-out mice has been described previously (10Nakau M. Miyoshi H. Seldin M.F. Imamura M. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4549-4553PubMed Google Scholar). We only used males due to the low incidence of nodular foci and HCCs in female Lkb1(+/−) mice, as reported previously. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyoto University. A mouse monoclonal anti-LKB1 (clone Ley37D/G6), anti-Myc (clone 9E10) and rabbit polyclonal anti-PAK1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-PAK1 (Ser144)/PAK2 (Ser141), anti-phospho-PAK1 (Ser199/204)/PAK2 (Ser201), anti-PAK1 and anti-phospho-Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) (Ser239) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-VASP antibody was from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ). A mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody was from Sigma- Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), and a mouse monoclonal anti-Hemagglutinin antibody was from Invivogen (San Diego, CA). Two different small interfering RNAs against human LKB1, and scramble siRNA pools were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The following cDNAs were isolated by standard PCR-based cloning techniques: human LKB1, NCBI accession no. NM_000455 and human STRAD, respectively, NCBI accession no. NM_001003787. HA and FLAG tags were attached to the N termini of LKB1 and STRAD, as described previously (17Kojima Y. Miyoshi H. Clevers H.C. Oshima M. Aoki M. Taketo M.M. J. Biol.

Wild-type of PAK1, constitutively active mutant T423E, and a dominant-negative mutant H83LH86LK299R were kindly gifted by Dr. Jonathan Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center). Appropriate PCR primers were used to generate the point mutants PAK1-T109E and PAK1-T109A with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit. These BamHI/EcoRI fragments were subcloned into pCMV-Tag 3B (Stratagene), which has an N-terminal Myc tag and a cytomegalovirus promoter. The NotI/SalI fragment of pCMV-Tag3B-PAK1-K299R was subcloned into pLEX vector (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). Recombinant lentivirus encoding K299R was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lkb1(+/−) mice (C57BL/6N background) were crossed with outbred ICR mice, and offspring were intercrossed. Lkb1-null embryos at 9.5 days post-coitum were minced, trypsinized briefly, and placed on 24-well plates. These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 50% (v/v) conditioned medium from the MEFs that were derived from wild-type embryos at 12.5 days post-coitum. We obtained a spontaneously immortalized cell line (MEF3) by continuous passages (>3 months) of the Lkb1-null MEFs and further established the subclone MEF3-2 cell line. Finally, we cultured MEF3-2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Recombinant adenoviruses were constructed by Adeno-X expression system 1 (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The titers of the recombinant adenoviruses were determined by the method previously reported by others (31Sandig V. Youil R. Bett A.J. Franlin L.L. Oshima M. Maione D. Wang F. Metzker M.L. Savino R. Caskey C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus; after 24 h of infection, wounds were incised by scratching the cell monolayer using 10-μl pipette tips. Photographs were taken at 0 and 20 h after the wound was made. Cell migration was normalized so that 100% represents the migration distance of control cells. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNA of the indicated PAK1 and LKB1 expression vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h of transfection, cell lysates were prepared for Western blotting or in vitro kinase assay. Lipofectamine 2000 RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) was used for small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection according to manufacturer's protocol. PAK1-PBD was isolated by standard PCR-based cloning techniques. The PAK1-PBD-T109A mutant was generated with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit. To attach GST protein to PAK1-PBD, PAK1-PBD-T109A, PAK1-K299R, or PAK1-T109A/K299R was inserted in the BamHI-double digested pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare). pGEX-2TK-VASP-(158–277) was generated previously (32Deguchi A. Soh J.W. Li H. Pamukcu R. Thompson W.J. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cancer. Ther. 2002; 1: 803-809PubMed Google Scholar). 200 ml of 2×YT medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, and 0.5% NaCl) medium was inoculated with E. coli (BL21 strain) containing the recombinant pGEX-2TK plasmid that encodes GST-VASP-(158–277), or the recombinant pGEX-6P-1 plasmid that encodes GST-PAK1-PBD, GST-PAK1-PBD-T109A, GST-PAK1-K299R, or GST-PAK1-T109A/K299R and was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin until A600 reached 0.8. To induce expression of the GST-tagged proteins, isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added at 100 μm. After culture for 24 additional hours at 25 °C, cells were harvested, and recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (17Kojima Y. Miyoshi H. Clevers H.C. Oshima M. Aoki M. Taketo M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23532-23540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing Complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After blocking with Blocking One or Blocking One-P (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), the membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies. The signals were visualized by Immobilon western detection system (Millipore) or ECL Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Phosphorylation reactions were performed at 30 °C in the phosphorylation reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 μm ATP). As shown in Figs. 1C and 2B, the immunoprecipitates obtained from cell lysates using anti-PAK1 antibody were incubated with GST-VASP-(158–277) for 20 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 3× sample buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% (w/v) SDS, 0.03% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 30% (v/v) glycerol, and 15% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol). The anti-Myc immunoprecipitates from HEK293T cell lysates were incubated with 5 μg of GST-VASP-(158–277) for 20 min with [γ-32P]-ATP (see Figs. 3A and 5). The reactions were then terminated by the addition of 3× sample buffer. The samples were electrophoresed on 5–20% SDS-PAGE gels. The blots were exposed to a phosphor imaging plate (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). The signals were detected by using BAS-5000 Bio-imaging Analyzer (Fujifilm). All assays using [γ-32P]ATP were done at the Radioisotope Research Center of Kyoto University. Fold induction was determined using NIH Image (version 1.62). Recombinant LKB1/STRAD/MO25 (Millipore) was preincubated with recombinant PAK1 (EMD Chemicals) in the presence of ATP for 20 min, and then the reaction mixtures were incubated with 5 μg of GST-VASP-(158–277) for 20 min (see Fig. 3B). The cellular levels of phosphorylated VASP were detected using an anti-phospho-VASP (Ser239) antibody.FIGURE 2Expression of LKB1 in the Lkb1-null MEF cell line (MEF3-2) inhibits cell migration and PAK1 activation.

A value of p < 0.05 was regarded as significant. We have reported previously that HCCs in Lkb1(+/−) mice metastasize to the lungs (10Nakau M. Miyoshi H. Seldin M.F. Imamura M. Oshima M. Taketo M.M. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4549-4553PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, LKB1 also appears to suppress lung cancer metastasis (33Ji H. Ramsey M.R. Hayes D.N. Fan C. McNamara K. Kozlowski P. Torrice C. Wu M.C. Shimamura T. Perera S.A. Liang M.C. Cai D. Naumov G.N. Bao L. Contreras C.M. Li D. Chen L. Krishnamurthy J. Koivunen J. Chirieac L.R. Padera R.F. Bronson R.T. Lindeman N.I. Christiani D.C.

To investigate the mechanism(s) by which LKB1 suppressed metastasis of cancer cells, we determined the effect of LKB1 knockdown on cell migration using a wound-healing assay. As test cells, we used a human colon cancer cell line HCT116 that expressed a significant level of LKB1 endogenously. HCT116 cells transfected with LKB1 siRNA (1 and 2) migrated 1.5× faster than those with scrambled siRNA pool (Fig. 1, A and B, Scr.). Because PAK1 is an important regulator of cell migration (34Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we investigated a possible role of PAK1 in cell migration enhanced by LKB1 knockdown. To determine the PAK1 activity in LKB1 knockdown cells, we then analyzed the level of phospho-PAK1 (Ser144), its active form (35Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Knockdown of LKB1 increased the cellular level of the phosphorylated PAK1, without affecting that of total PAK1 (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that knockdown of LKB1 increases the PAK1 activity. To confirm this interpretation, we determined the effect of LKB1 knockdown on in vitro PAK1 activity. Because histone H4, a widely used substrate for PAK1, was phosphorylated by LKB1 (data not shown), we screened in silico candidate substrate sequences for PAK1 using the consensus phosphorylation motif ((K/R)(R/X)(X)(pS/pT)) (34Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 133-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as a query. As a candidate, we identified VASP-(158–277), which is a major substrate for both PKA and PKG (32Deguchi A. Soh J.W. Li H. Pamukcu R. Thompson W.J. Weinstein I.B. Mol. Cancer. Ther. 2002; 1: 803-809PubMed Google Scholar, 36Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first verified that recombinant PAK1 efficiently phosphorylated GST-VASP-(158–277) (data not shown). We found that PAK1 activity was significantly higher in LKB1 knockdown cells than in the control cells (Fig. 1C). To further investigate whether enhanced PAK1 activity contributed to the cell migration increase in LKB1 knockdown cells, we tested the effect of a dominant-negative mutant PAK1-K299R in LKB1 knockdown cells. Notably, expression of PAK1-K299R suppressed the increase in migration of these cells (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that LKB1 inhibits PAK1 activity, which can suppress cell migration. To investigate the role of LKB1 in suppression of PAK1-mediated signaling, we further evaluated the effect of forced LKB1 expression on PAK1 activation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack wild-type LKB1 (MEF3-2). To this end, we used the recombinant adenovirus encoding LKB1/STRAD (Adv-LKB1) that contained a transcription termination cassette (STOP sequence) flanked by the loxP sequences and expressed LKB1/STRAD by co-infection of MEF3-2 with Adv-Cre, which removed the STOP sequence from Adv-LKB1. The floxed inducible system was employed because LKB1 had some cytotoxic effects on host HEK293 cells and hampered production of the LKB1-expressing recombinant adenovirus. Such cytotoxicity was not observed with MEF3-2 cells up to 48 h post-induction. (Fig. 2A) (17Kojima Y. Miyoshi H. Clevers H.C. Oshima M. Aoki M. Taketo M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23532-23540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The cells infected with Adv-LKB1 alone showed similar activity of PAK1 to those infected with Adv-Cre alone (control cells) (Fig. 2B). Notably, forced expression of LKB1/STRAD by co-infection of Adv-LKB1 and Adv-Cre decreased the cellular level of the phosphorylated PAK1 but not that of total PAK1 and inhibited the PAK1 activity by ∼60% as compared with that in the control cells infected with Adv-Cre o"
https://openalex.org/W1532593591,"Before a sperm can fertilize an egg it must undergo a final activation step induced by the egg termed the acrosome reaction. During the acrosome reaction a lysosome-related organelle, the acrosome, fuses with the plasma membrane to release hydrolytic enzymes and expose an egg-binding protein. Because NAADP (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate) releases Ca(2+) from acidic lysosome-related organelles in other cell types, we investigated a possible role for NAADP in mediating the acrosome reaction. We report that NAADP binds with high affinity to permeabilized sea urchin sperm. Moreover, we used Mn(2+) quenching of luminal fura-2 and (45)Ca(2+) to directly demonstrate NAADP regulation of a cation channel on the acrosome. Additionally, we show that NAADP synthesis occurs through base exchange and is driven by an increase in Ca(2+). We propose a new model for acrosome reaction signaling in which Ca(2+) influx initiated by egg jelly stimulates NAADP synthesis and that this NAADP acts on its receptor/channel on the acrosome to release Ca(2+) to drive acrosomal exocytosis."

However, its function in platelets remains unknown. We show that Cbl-b is expressed in human platelets along with c-Cbl, but in contrast to c-Cbl, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated upon glycoprotein VI (GPVI) stimulation. Cbl-b, unlike c-Cbl, is not required for Syk ubiquitylation downstream of GPVI activation. Phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) are constituently associated with Cbl-b. Cbl-b-deficient (Cbl-b−/−) platelets display an inhibition in the concentration-response curve for GPVI-specific agonist-induced aggregation, secretion, and Ca2+ mobilization. A parallel inhibition is found for activation of PLCγ2 and BTK. However, Syk activation is not affected by the absence of Cbl-b, indicating that Cbl-b acts downstream of Syk but upstream of BTK and PLCγ2. When Cbl-b−/− mice were tested in the ferric chloride thrombosis model, occlusion time was increased and clot stability was reduced compared with wild type controls. These data indicate that Cbl-b plays a positive modulatory role in GPVI-dependent platelet signaling, which translates to an important regulatory role in hemostasis and thrombosis in vivo.

Signaling downstream of the GPVI/Fc receptor γ chain is similar to signaling initiated by activation of immune receptors on T- and B-lymphocytes. The Fc receptor γ-chain contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif. Binding of collagen to the receptor is thought to cluster the receptors, which initiates the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif tyrosines by an Src family kinase.

A primary role for ubiquitylation is targeting the substrates of E3 ligases to the proteasome, where the substrates are proteolytically degraded. Because of this activity, Cbl family members have come to be considered as negative regulators of signaling. In platelets, c-Cbl promotes ubiquitylation of Syk and appears to be a negative regulator of platelet activation. Murine platelets deficient in c-Cbl show enhanced platelet aggregation in response to convulxin, a GPVI agonist (8Auger J.M. Best D. Snell D.C. Wilde J.I. Watson S.P. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 2419-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 9Dangelmaier C.A. Quinter P.G. Jin J. Tsygankov A.Y. Kunapuli S.P. Daniel J.L. Blood. 2005; 105: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that Syk is not ubiquitylated in c-Cbl−/− platelets, in contrast to normal platelets (9Dangelmaier C.A. Quinter P.G. Jin J. Tsygankov A.Y. Kunapuli S.P. Daniel J.L. Blood. 2005; 105: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The presence of Cbl-b in platelets and any role it might have in signaling have not been investigated. Because Cbl-b is also an E3 ligase, one might expect that it would also be a negative regulator of cell function. However, several reports have indicated that Cbl-b may play a positive role in both T cell and B cell signaling. Cbl-b interacts with Zap-70, leading to activation of T-cell-specific transcription factor NF-AT (10Zhang Z. Elly C. Qiu L. Altman A. Liu Y.C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 203-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cbl-b−/− DT40 B cells display reduced PLCγ2 activation and Ca2+ mobilization upon B-cell receptor stimulation, and the overexpression of Cbl-b results in an enhanced agonist-dependent Ca2+ mobilization (11Yasuda T. Tezuka T. Maeda A. Inazu T. Yamanashi Y. Gu H. Kurosaki T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results may be explained by another function of the Cbl molecules, namely that they have several domains in addition to those responsible for the E3 ligase activity, which, acting as a scaffold, can bind to a variety of signaling molecules, bringing them into close proximity (6Swaminathan G.

Given the importance of Cbl-b to regulation of signaling in lymphocytes, we have investigated whether Cbl-b regulates platelet activation downstream of the collagen receptor GPVI. We report that Cbl-b is present in human platelets. Murine platelets deficient in Cbl-b show diminished agonist-dependent platelet aggregation and Ca2+ mobilization. Using the FeCl3 model of vascular injury, we have found the Cbl-b−/− mice exhibit prolonged time to vessel occlusion. All reagents were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) was from Upstate USA (Charlottesville, VA). Anti-Syk (4D10 and N19), anti-Cbl-b (H121, G1, and 246C5a), anti-PLCγ2 (Q20), Protein A/G PLUS-agarose, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphospecific Syk (Tyr509/Tyr510), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473), anti-phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-ERK, and anti-actin were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly MA). Anti-p85 phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase was from Calbiochem. Anti-BTK(E9), anti-c-Cbl, and anti-SLP76 were from BD Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Anti-phosphospecific BTK (Tyr(P)551) was from Epitomics (Burlingame, CA). Anti-phosphospecific PLCγ2 (Tyr(P)753, Tyr(P)759) was prepared as previously described (14Ozdener F. Dangelmaier C. Ashby B. Kunapuli S.P. Daniel J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). AYPGKF was custom synthesized at Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate was from Pierce. Convulxin was purified according to the method of Polgár et al. (15Polgár J. Clemetson J.M. Kehrel B.E. Wiedemann M. Magnenat E.M.

Cross-linked collagen-related peptide (CRP) was synthesized at the University of Cambridge (16Morton L.F. Hargreaves P.G. Farndale R.W. Young R.D. Barnes M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Blood was collected from informed healthy volunteers according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Temple University into one-sixth volume of acid/citrate/dextrose (85 mm sodium citrate, 111 mm glucose, 71.4 mm citric acid). Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 180 × g for 15 min at ambient temperature and incubated with 1 mm aspirin for 30 min at 37 °C. Platelets were isolated from plasma by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at ambient temperature and resuspended in HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.42 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 units/ml apyrase). The platelet count was adjusted to 2 × 108/ml. 500-μl aliquots of platelets were equilibrated at 37 °C in the presence of 200 nm GR144053 (Sigma), a fibrinogen receptor antagonist, to prevent aggregation. Platelets were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of agonists. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Samples were kept on ice for 10 min to ensure total lysis and centrifuged either for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C or for 30 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C to make certain that the cytoskeletal proteins were removed. The following antibodies were from Emfret Analytics (Eibelstat, Germany): phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse JON/A, phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse CD41 (αIIb), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse GPVI (clone JAQ1), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse integrin α2 (CD49b, GPIa), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rat anti-mouse GPIb α (CD42b). These were used for flow cytometry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from human blood using Ficoll-Paque Plus (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cbl-b−/− mice were a gift of Drs. Hua Gu and Richard Hodes, and generation of these mice has been reported (17Chiang Y.J. Kole H.K. Brown K. Naramura M. Fukuhara S. Hu R.J. Jang I.K. Gutkind J.S. Shevach E. Gu H. Nature. 2000; 403: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Generation of Cbl-b RING finger mutant has also been previously documented (18Oksvold M.P. Dagger S.A. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Mutant mice and WT littermates were 8–10 weeks of age on a C57BL/6 genetic background. All mice were maintained and housed in a specific pathogen-free facility, and animal procedures were carried out in accordance with institutional guidelines after the Temple University Animal Care and Use Committee approved the study protocol. Whole blood platelet counts of these mice were determined using a Hemavet 950FS blood cell counter (Drew Scientific Inc., Dallas, TX). All mice tested were within the normal range. For aggregation, blood was collected from the vena cava of anesthetized mice into syringes containing 1:10 blood volume of 3.8% sodium citrate as anticoagulant. The blood was then mixed with 200 μl of 3.8% sodium citrate, and red blood cells were separated by centrifugation at 100 × g for 10 min. Platelet-rich plasma was removed, an additional 400 μl of 3.8% sodium citrate was added to the residual red blood cells, and cells were centrifuged again at 100 × g for 10 min. The platelet-rich plasmas were combined, 1 μm prostaglandin E1 was added, and samples were centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min. The platelet pellet was resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 unit/ml apyrase. Aggregation was performed in a lumiaggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA). Murine platelets for measurement of calcium mobilization were prepared differently. Whole blood was mixed with 4 volumes of PIPES-buffered Tyrode's solution (pH 6.5) containing 500 μm EGTA, 10 μm indomethacin, and 1 μm prostaglandin E1. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 100 × g at room temperature. The platelet-rich plasma was removed, diluted to 10 ml with the above buffer, and centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The platelet pellet was resuspended in the above buffer (1 ml/mouse) and incubated with 5 μm Fura-2/AM for 45 min at room temperature. The platelets were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at room temperature and finally resuspended in HEPES-buffered Tyrode's solution containing 10 μm indomethacin. The platelets were allowed to recover for 15 min at room temperature prior to the start of the experiment. The details of Ca2+ measurement have been previously documented (19Quinter P.G. Dangelmaier C.A. Quinton T.M. Kunapuli S.P. Daniel J.L. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2007; 5: 362-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The data in the graphs represent the maximal Ca2+ concentration minus basal Ca2+ concentration. Platelet secretion was determined by measuring the release of ATP using the Chronolume reagent (Chrono-Log). The activation of platelets was performed in a lumiaggregometer at 37 °C with stirring at 900 rpm, and the secretion was measured and expressed as pmol of ATP released per 108 platelets. Washed murine platelets were used to measure agonist-dependent level of activated aIIbb3 receptors by JON/A-phycoerythrin antibody. Aliquots (0.3 ml) of washed platelet suspension in Tyrode's buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm CaCl2 were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of convulxin for 5 min at 37 °C. An aliquot containing 106 platelets was gently mixed with 10 μl of antibody mixture and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark. Platelets were identified and gated according to the forward and side scatter signal during dual color analysis. As a control for immunolabeling, platelets were incubated with nonimmune IgG isotype control antibody. To fix the platelets, 1% paraformaldehyde dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline was added. A total of 10,000 platelet events were acquired per sample, and the percentage of positive gated cells was analyzed. For surface expression of αIIb (CD41), GPVI (clone JAQ1), α2 (CD49b, GPIa), and GPIbα (CD42b), aliquots (30 μl) of murine washed platelet suspension in Tyrode's buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm CaCl2 were incubated with 10 μl of the corresponding antibody for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark and analyzed as described above. All determinations were performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) (20Nagy Jr., B. Bhavaraju K. Getz T. Bynagari Y.S. Kim S. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2009; 113: 2557-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide) and transferred to Immobilon-P. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (TBS + 0.05% Tween) for 1 h at room temperature and probed overnight at 4 °C with appropriate antibodies. Blots were washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 60 min at room temperature. Blots were washed an additional three times, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected using a chemiluminescent substrate. Bands were visualized on a Fuji imaging system, and densities were calculated with Image Gauge software. For detection of phospho-Syk, phospho-BTK, and phospho-PLCγ2 in murine platelets, samples were aggregated with various concentrations of convulxin for 1 min in the presence of indomethacin and the ADP antagonists MRS2179 (100 μm) and 2-methio-AMP (5 μm). An equal volume of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA was added, and the sample was centrifuged for 2 min at 800 × g at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and the platelet pellet was solubilized in 100 μl of Laemmli reducing sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Alternatively, proteins were precipitated with 0.6 n perchloric acid, the precipitates were washed once with water, and the protein pellets were solubilized in 100 μl of Laemmli reducing sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Proteins were separated and detected as described above. For phospho-AKT, phospho-ERK, and total ERK, platelets were treated in the same manner, and blots were analyzed using the Licor Odyssey imaging system. Full-length human Cbl-b cDNA (Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) was inserted into the polycloning site (XhoI-KpnI) of the baculovirus vector pAcGHLT-B (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Sf9 cells were co-transfected with the full-length Cbl-b clone and BaculoGold DNA, the recombinant virus was amplified, and the GST-Cbl-b recombinant protein was expressed and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human platelets were isolated as described above except that one wash with PIPES-buffered Tyrode's solution (pH 6.5) containing 500 μm EGTA, 10 μm indomethacin, and 1 μm prostaglandin E1 was included prior to final resuspension. The platelet count was adjusted to 4 × 108/ml, and 2-ml aliquots were activated in the presence of 200 nm GR144053 at 37 °C with 200 ng/ml convulxin for the indicated periods of time. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold lysis buffer, resulting in final concentrations of 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at +4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to clean tubes, and 50 pmol of GST-Cbl-b-agarose or GST-agarose were added. Samples were rocked for 60 min at 4 °C, and the agarose beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with Tris-buffered saline. Solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed for specific proteins as indicated. For co-immunoprecipitation studies, lysates were prepared in a manner similar to that described above except that centrifugation was for 30 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Proteins were immunoprecipitated for 16 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of appropriate antibodies. 25 μl of Protein A/G PLUS-agarose were added, and samples were incubated for another 60 min at 4 °C with rocking. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1× lysis buffer and one time with TBS (10 mm Tris (pH 7.6) and 150 mm NaCl). Adult mice (6–8 weeks old, weight ∼25 g) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (40 mg/kg). Experimental groups consisted of WT mice and Cbl-b−/− mice. The left carotid artery was surgically exposed, and a miniature Doppler flow probe (model 0.7PSB, Transonic Systems (Ithaca, NY)) was placed on the surface of the artery. Normal saline was placed in the surgical wound to allow Doppler monitoring, and base-line blood flow was recorded using a Transonic model T402 flow meter. Whatman no. 1 filter paper (1 × 1 mm) saturated with 10% FeCl3 was applied to the adventitial surface of the carotid artery, immediately proximal to the flow probe. After 2 min, the filter paper was removed, saline solution was again placed in the wound, and carotid blood flow was monitored. (Note that it is not possible to monitor carotid artery blood flow during the application of FeCl3.) Time to thrombotic occlusion after initiation of arterial injury was defined as the time required for blood flow to decline to 0 ml/min. The operator was blinded to mouse genotype while performing all experiments. All statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism®. Dose-response curves were fit to a simple hyperbolic equation, and differences between the fits of WT and mutant cells were determined using comparisons built into that package. Because Cbl-b has not previously been shown to be present in platelets, we assessed its presence using Western blotting. To show that the platelet expression level of Cbl-b is comparable with that in cells in which the biochemical and physiologic importance of Cbl-b is established, we compared Cbl-b levels in PBMCs with those in platelets by comparing Cbl-b immunoreactivity over a range of protein concentrations. As shown in Fig. 1A, Cbl-b is expressed in platelets at levels similar to its expression in PBMCs. We next determined whether Cbl-b, similar to c-Cbl, is tyrosine-phosphorylated in platelets in response to GPVI agonists. Fig. 1B compares phosphorylation of c-Cbl to Cbl-b in immunoprecipitates of each respective protein in platelets stimulated with convulxin (100 ng/ml). Although c-Cbl shows marked phosphorylation, no significant phosphorylation of Cbl-b is seen, indicating that GPVI-dependent activation does not result in Cbl-b phosphorylation. In order to address the significance of Cbl-b in intracellular signaling in platelets, we undertook a study of the consequences of Cbl-b deficiency for platelet activation. Prior to these studies, we characterized the effect of Cbl-b gene ablation on the expression of other relevant platelet signaling proteins. Fig. 2 shows that for all of the proteins tested, including c-Cbl, Syk, BTK, GPVI, and PLCγ2, their levels in Cbl-b−/− platelets were not altered compared with WT platelets. We also monitored the levels of GPVI, αIIbβ3, GPIaIIa, and GPIb on the platelet surface using flow cytometry. We did not find a significant difference when platelets from WT mice were compared with Cbl-b−/− platelets (supplemental Fig. S1). Although we had shown that c-Cbl is required for the ubiquitylation of Syk, it is possible that Cbl-b might also play a role in Syk ubiquitylation. In order to address this question, we obtained platelets isolated from Cbl-b knock-out mice and then stimulated with the GPVI agonist convulxin. Fig. 3 shows that ubiquitylation of Syk is normal in the Cbl-b−/− murine platelets, as indicated by the presence of the immunoreactive bands at about 8 and 16 kDa above Syk. The same experiment was performed in c-Cbl−/− platelets for contrast because these cells show an absence of the ubiquitylated bands (9Dangelmaier C.A. Quinter P.G. Jin J. Tsygankov A.Y. Kunapuli S.P. Daniel J.L. Blood. 2005; 105: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition to being E3 ligases, Cbl family members also have been shown to function as adapter proteins in many different cells. Therefore, we investigated whether Cbl-b might play a similar role in platelets. Previous studies in DT40 cells had shown that Cbl-b associates with both BTK and PLCγ2 (11Yasuda T. Tezuka T. Maeda A. Inazu T. Yamanashi Y. Gu H. Kurosaki T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We tried three approaches to test the specificity of interaction of PLCγ2 and BTK with Cbl-b. First, we used co-immunoprecipitation using anti-Cbl-b antibodies. In order to minimize nonspecific interactions, platelet lysates were precleared at 100,000 × g prior to immunoprecipitation to remove cytoskeletal proteins. Samples were treated with either anti-Cbl-b or control IgG in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The blots of immunoprecipitated protein were probed with antibodies to either Cbl-b, BTK, PLCγ2, or Syk. All four proteins were found in these immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A). However, because Syk was also found in the non-immune control, its interaction with Cbl-b was judged to be nonspecific. Following the same protocol, anti-BTK was used to immunoprecipitate proteins from platelet lysates. Again, both Cbl-b and PLCγ2 were found to specifically associate with BTK (Fig. 4B). Last, a GST pull-down experiment was performed using GST-Cbl-b. Precleared lysates were treated with either GST-agarose or Cbl-b-GST-agarose in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Fig. 4C shows that PLCγ2 and BTK from human platelets specifically associate with Cbl-b. The specificity of the reaction is indicated by the fact that GST-agarose does not associate with either protein. In contrast, Syk does not appear to be specifically associated with Cbl-b, confirming the co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Overall, the experiments suggest that the interactions of Cbl-b with PLCγ2 and BTK are constitutive because their association is not dependent on agonist stimulation. We also were unable to detect a specific association of Cbl-b with SLP-76 (data not shown). In order to determine whether Cbl-b plays a physiologically significant role in platelet function, we compared platelet aggregation in WT and Cbl-b−/− murine platelets. Fig. 5A shows the comparison of murine platelet aggregation induced by either convulxin or CRP. With low concentrations of both GPVI agonists, a diminished aggregation is apparent in the Cbl-b−/− platelets. Aggregation in mutant (Cblb-RFm) platelets in which the ring finger domain is altered to inhibit E3 ligase activity (Cbl-b:C373A) (18Oksvold M.P. Dagger S.A. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Mol. Immunol. 2008; 45: 925-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) did not significantly differ from WT platelets. We also assessed integrin αIIa/βIII activation using flow cytometry with the JON/A antibody, which detects the active state of this integrin (21Kauffenstein G. Bergmeier W. Eckly A. Ohlmann P. Léon C. Cazenave J.P. Nieswandt B. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The pattern of integrin activation was similar to that of aggregation with JON/A binding in the Cbl−/− platelets (supplemental Fig. S2). Secretion of ATP was also assessed in the three different mouse models. A significant reduction was seen in the Cbl−/− platelets but not the Cbl-b-RFm platelets (Fig. 5B). We also assessed GPVI-dependent Ca2+ mobilization in these platelets. Fig. 5C shows representative CRP concentration response Ca2+ traces from a single experiment. We found no difference in either aggregation or secretion induced by the PAR4 agonist, AYPGKF (not shown). Fig. 5, D and E, shows composite concentration-response curves of Ca2+ mobilization for convulxin and CRP from multiple experiments. Both curves show inhibition of Ca2+ mobilization in platelets deficient in Cbl-b. Statistical analysis indicates that the WT and Cbl-b−/− curves were significantly different from each other (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.003; CRP and convulxin, respectively). We also determined Ca2+ mobilization induced by the PAR 4 agonist AYPGKF in WT and Cbl-b−/− mice (Fig. 5F). Comparison of responses of WT and Cbl-b−/− platelets for this agonist did not show statistical significance (p = 0.453). As a further control (Fig. 5G), we compared Ca2+ mobilization in Cbl-b RFm platelets. Ca2+ mobilization in these platelets is not significantly different from that in WT platelets (p = 0.101). In order to discern the signaling pathways involved in Cbl-b-dependent activation, we compared the activation of key signaling molecules in the GPVI-dependent activation pathway. In Fig. 6A, we have used a phosphospecific antibody to the phosphotyrosines in the activation loop of Syk (Tyr509/Tyr510) and found that there was no difference between WT and Cbl-b−/− cells when stimulated with convulxin (p = 0.564). When the activation-dependent phosphorylation of BTK (Tyr551) was determined in the same experiment, Cbl-b−/− mice showed a distinct suppression of BTK phosphorylation (Fig. 6B) that was statistically significant (p = 0.0001). Similar results were seen for phospholipase Cγ2 activation (Tyr753/Tyr759; Fig. 6C, pY753,759) (p = 0.0007), indicating that Cbl-b facilitates the activation of BTK and PLCγ2 but not Syk. In order to determine whether the reduced PLCγ2 activation of Cbl-b−/− platelets could be explained by a Cbl-b-dependent activation of PI-3 kinase, we compared Akt and ERK activation in WT and Cbl-b−/− cells as shown in Fig. 6D. Because Akt activation is downstream of PI-3 kinase activity, these data indicate that Cbl-b regulates PLCγ2 activation independently of PI-3 kinase activation. In order to assess the role of Cbl-b in the in vivo function of platelets, Cbl-b−/− mice were studied in the FeCl3 injury model of thrombosis. I"
https://openalex.org/W2057349527,"Homogentisate solanesyl transferase (HST) catalyzes the prenylation and decarboxylation of homogentisate to form 2-methyl-6-solanesyl-1,4-benzoquinol, the first intermediate in plastoquinone-9 biosynthesis. In vitro, HST from Spinacia oleracea L., Arabidopsis thaliana, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were all found to use not only solanesyl diphosphate but also short chain prenyl diphosphates of 10-20 carbon atoms as prenyl donors. Surprisingly, with these donors, prenyl transfer was largely decoupled from decarboxylation, and thus the major products were 6-prenyl-1,4-benzoquinol-2-methylcarboxylates rather than the expected 2-methyl-6-prenyl-1,4-benzoquinols. The 6-prenyl-1,4-benzoquinol-2-methylcarboxylates were not substrates for HST-catalyzed decarboxylation, and the enzyme kinetics associated with forming these products appeared quite distinct from those for 2-methyl-6-prenyl-1,4-benzoquinol formation in respect of catalytic rate, substrate K(m) value, and the pattern of inhibition by haloxydine, a molecule that appeared to act as a dead end mimic of homogentisate. These observations were reconciled into a simple model for the HST mechanism. Here, prenyl diphosphate binds to HST to form at least two alternative complexes that go on to react differently with homogentisate and prenylate it either with or without it first being decarboxylated. It is supposed that solanesyl diphosphate binds tightly and preferentially in the mode that compels prenylation with decarboxylation."
https://openalex.org/W2087786655,"Although post-translational modifications by the small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) are known to be important in DNA damage response, it is unclear whether they have a role in double-strand break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Here, we analyzed various DSB repair pathways upon inhibition of SUMO-mediated protein–protein interactions using peptides that contain the SUMO-interaction motif (SIM) and discriminate between mono- and SUMO-chain modifications. The SIM peptides specifically inhibit NHEJ as shown by in vivo repair assays and radio-sensitivity of cell lines deficient in different DSB repair pathways. Furthermore, mono-SUMO, instead of SUMO-chain, modifications appear to be involved in NHEJ. Immunoprecipitation experiments also showed that the SIM peptide interacted with SUMOylated Ku70 after radiation. This study is the first to show an important role for SUMO:SIM-mediated protein–protein interactions in NHEJ, and provides a mechanistic basis for the role of SIM peptide in sensitizing genotoxic stress of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028583475,"Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) regulates the proinflammatory cytokine signaling mediated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. SOCS3 is rapidly induced and then targeted to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway via a mechanism that requires the C-terminal SOCS box. Due to its rapid turnover, the intracellular stores of SOCS3 seem insufficient to control acute or protracted inflammatory diseases. Previously, we developed an intracellular protein therapy that uses a recombinant cell-penetrating form of SOCS3 (CP-SOCS3) to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway and prevent cytokine-mediated lethal inflammation and apoptosis of the liver (Jo, D., Liu, D., Yao, S., Collins, R. D., and Hawiger, J. (2005) Nat. Med. 11, 892–898). The potent anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective activity of CP-SOCS3 prompted us to analyze its intracellular turnover, as compared with that of endogenous SOCS3 protein induced in macrophages by the proinflammatory agonists, interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide. We found that the half-life (t½) of endogenous SOCS3 is 0.7 h in activated macrophages, compared with a t½ of 6.2 h for recombinant CP-SOCS3. Deletion of the SOCS box in CP-SOCS3 renders it more resistant to proteasomal degradation, extending its t½ to 29 h. Consequently, this SOCS box-deleted form of CP-SOCS3 displays persistent inhibitory activity for 24 h toward interferon-γ- and lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine and chemokine production. Compared with the wild-type suppressor, this gain-of-function CP-SOCS3 mutant provides a longer acting inhibitor of cytokine signaling, a feature that offers a clear advantage for the intracellular delivery of proteins to treat acute or protracted inflammatory diseases. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) regulates the proinflammatory cytokine signaling mediated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. SOCS3 is rapidly induced and then targeted to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway via a mechanism that requires the C-terminal SOCS box. Due to its rapid turnover, the intracellular stores of SOCS3 seem insufficient to control acute or protracted inflammatory diseases. Previously, we developed an intracellular protein therapy that uses a recombinant cell-penetrating form of SOCS3 (CP-SOCS3) to inhibit the JAK/STAT pathway and prevent cytokine-mediated lethal inflammation and apoptosis of the liver (Jo, D., Liu, D., Yao, S., Collins, R. D., and Hawiger, J. (2005) Nat. Med. 11, 892–898). The potent anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective activity of CP-SOCS3 prompted us to analyze its intracellular turnover, as compared with that of endogenous SOCS3 protein induced in macrophages by the proinflammatory agonists, interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide.

Can video games and computer simulations revive science education in the US? Amy Maxmen has the story. This March, for the first time, a member of the White House spoke at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in San Francisco, where video game programmers, producers, and designers gathered to discuss the lucrative future of the video game industry (http://www.gdconf.com). Kumar Garg, a policy analyst for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), presented to the conference attendees a challenge handed down from President Obama regarding the dilemma the US faces in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. “Now the hard truth is that for decades we've been losing ground. One assessment shows American 15-year-olds now rank 21st in science and 25th in math when compared to their peers around the world. And this isn't news. We've seen worrying statistics like this for years,” Obama remarked on November 23rd as part of his “Educate to Innovate” campaign (http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/remarks-president-education-innovate-campaign). “And that's why I'm committed to moving our country from the middle to the top of the pack in science and math education over the next decade.” Not only OSTP but also the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have been concentrating on ways to make good on Obama's commitment. And video games, they hope, may be one solution. “The trend is that we are going to have more games and more types of games,” says Garg. “It's an important time to talk about the role of games that serve the public interest.” He explains, “I work on STEM education, and the challenges that the games community works on could be hugely relevant.” By immersing players in a virtual world, video games and computer simulations force people to solve problems they don't normally face. Completing a level relies on learning skills programmed into the game—be those skills stealing cars or engulfing invading bacteria. As in school, skills are attained gradually as the player moves on to higher levels of difficulty in the game. Garg says, “As one person at GDC put it, game developers think a lot about level one. If you mess up level one, you haven't created a good game. So they think about what experiences keep people going…it must be hard enough so that there's a continuous path of improvement, but not so hard that it stops being engaging. And that's important in learning.” For years, computer simulations have been giving soldiers, surgeons, and racecar drivers lessons to prepare them for their careers. Now, game developers have been challenged to show that video games and simulations can train kids to think like scientists, mathematicians, and engineers. Furthermore, games allow teachers, parents, and funding agencies to observe how students learn as they play. In fact, science-related games embedded with assessment software can even act as alternatives to paper exams for testing critical thinking. What the current administration has realized is that reforming science education means more than memorizing facts and bolstering exam grades. If America is to maintain its competitive edge, the type of critical scientific thinking that comes with experience must be nurtured. More than 50 years ago, educational philosopher John Dewey emphasized the role of human experience in learning. His opinions appear to be making a comeback. “We wouldn't teach football from a textbook. It is even more important that America's youth have the opportunity to learn math and science by doing,” said John Holdren, Science Advisor to President Obama, as he introduced a new STEM education project called National Lab Day (http://www.nationallabday.org). National Lab Day is a nationwide effort to bring experiment-based learning to children across the US, and although there will be an actual “day”—celebrated across the country on May 12th—activities and the website operate year round. Like a dating service, the website automatically matches volunteers from the private and public sectors to requests from teachers who want to give their students hands-on learning experiences in science, technology, engineering, and math. Among the requests are four “teacher seeking video game designer” advertisements. The NSF, NIH, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Microsoft Corporation, AT&T, and others have pledged to support National Lab Day. At OSTP's urging, the MacArthur Foundation aligned its $2 million “Game Changer” competition to design compelling science-related video games with the announcement of National Lab Day. Winners will receive awards ranging from $5,000 to $50,000, as well as recognition from the game industry companies Sony and Electronic Arts. Meanwhile, the Siemens Corporation has kicked off another nationwide initiative, called the Siemens STEM Academy (http://stem.discoveryeducation.com), to immerse students in activities related to careers in STEM. “The main thing that's on our minds is how do you get enough kids interested in STEM to fulfill what turns out to be a big gap in our employee base. We have over 600 openings in the US for engineers, and the demand is going up. True, there are probably more than 600 engineers in the US looking for jobs, but we are very selective,” says Siemens Corporate Research division President Paul Camuti. “We have to be worried about the STEM education base in the US. It's a fundamental problem, so we think we need to connect with kids in a different way than we used to, using the technology available today.” Educational video games have been around since the 1970s, but most have faded into obscurity. According to education expert James Paul Gee at Arizona State University, the problem is that many games simply present textbook-like questions on a flashy background. “It's what I call chocolate-covered broccoli,” says Gee. “These games only sugar-coated content that was just old skill and drill. But that industry has sort of fallen apart. Now we instead want to put people in problem solving space. Games today can give you experiences and understandings you could have never gotten before.” For example, students can manipulate electromagnetic fields before looking at a formula. Outside of school, people learn through experiences. And new words come with situations attached. That's why manuals make more sense after playing a video game, fixing a bicycle, or cloning a gene than they do before. Likewise, Gee explains, playing a video game before opening a book can facilitate learning. In 2004, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) set out to prove that video games can boost the ability of 7th through 12th graders to learn science. In an informal survey of high school teachers, immunology had been voted the hardest subject to teach, and so FAS created a video game called Immune Attack (http://fas.org/immuneattack). “Prepare to visit an alien world that is closer than you think,” warns the game trailer as the video zooms through a pulsating, three-dimensional universe of cells and molecules. Immune Attack took a cue from award-winning, third-person shooter games like Resident Evil 4, in which the player's character is visible on the screen. Players travel inside a patient afflicted by a dysfunctional immune system in a “nanobot” and perform feats that eventually save the patient from succumbing to the disease, like teaching white blood cells to locate an infection by following a cytokine cloud (Figure 1). Since its release in March 2008, Immune Attack has been downloaded 12,000 times and 600 teachers have agreed to evaluate the game for FAS in their classrooms. Melanie Stegman, FAS program director for educational technologies, came to FAS after a postdoc in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College. She tries her hardest to keep the game scientifically sound and even has the game peer-reviewed. “Blood flow happens accurately, molecules crowd accurately—the fun thing is that the complexity of the science makes the game challenging,” Stegman says. Immunologist Bill Muller at Northwestern University in Chicago reviewed the game's introduction on immune cells. He says, “I like the idea of making science accessible but you don't want to dumb it down. If everything is simple, then people may start to wonder, ‘Well, if it's so simple, then why can't scientists cure cancer and tuberculosis?’” Moreover, Muller adds that intrigue inspires interest. “If you want people to go into science, you should let them know that there are many big, important questions to be answered by the next generation of scientists.” In the second version of Immune Attack, slated for release this summer, players can link to real images of cells and proteins, as well as to researchers' websites. Importantly, this information will not interfere with game play. FAS is currently assessing what students learn from Immune Attack. Thus far, student game players perform better on immunology multiple choice tests than students who have never played the game, plus they are more confident. “If a student feels like immune cells are something they are familiar with, not something that only ‘smart people’ know about, then they will be more confident in their ability to understand what the teacher is presenting,” says Stegman. In addition, FAS hopes the game might be played by people of all ages so that they might better comprehend articles on public health, environmental contaminants, and other news related to cell and molecular biology. The NIH has recently awarded the project a 5 year, $750,000 grant. An increasing number of games have built-in tools for assessment that keep track of how a person plays. New software can aggregate these data and let evaluators know how students go about solving scientific problems. Arlene de Strulle, NSF Program Director in the Division of Research on Learning, says, “Advances in technology now afford game developers with the capacity to embed sophisticated assessment tools into a game to understand the cognitive processes associated with learning through game-play as it's taking place. Through games, teachers can assess student progress and track student decision-making, and students are enabled to scaffold their own learning processes.” Chris Dede, a professor of learning technologies at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, is working on “virtual performance assessments,” game-like simulations that teach and test skills of scientific inquiry, like making observations and forming hypotheses. In one of Dede's games, students roam two virtual Alaskan coastlines and ask questions about why kelp on one coast is healthier than that on the other. “Paper and pencil tests aren't valid for measuring higher order thinking or collaborative skills. Failing a pencil and paper test may indicate that the student is a poor reader, even when they have good skills of scientific inquiry,” Dede explains. The danger in failing is that a student who enjoys science may become frustrated with the subject for the wrong reasons. Diane Jass Ketelhut, a professor of science education at Temple University in Philadelphia, is developing SAVE Science (short for “Situation Assessment using Virtual Environments” of scientific content and inquiry) to test comprehension of scientific principles. In one SAVE Science game called Sheep Trouble, players observe a farmer's flocks and propose experiments to determine why one flock isn't doing well. “Teachers can follow what parts of concepts like adaptation students don't understand and they can also use that information to give a grade,” explains Ketelhut. “On a normal test, you tell students what to do. Here, they decide. Plus, when we tested it out on kids, they seemed to have a good time. They said, ‘Make it harder! We know it's a test, but make it harder!’” “When you log into a new virtual world, you never know what the goal is right away. So you learn how to explore, what to explore first, and how to deal with overcoming challenges,” explains epidemiologist Nina Fefferman at Rutgers University in New Jersey. When the flu-like Whypox sweeps through the virtual world of Whyville (http://www.whyville.net), students take measures to control the outbreak as it rapidly interrupts their ability to socialize with other avatars online. Fefferman and her colleagues observe how players react to this and other outbreaks, and they've encountered unexpected reactions. For instance, a number of students feigned illness to fit in with their peers, others sold fake cures for virtual profit, and some systematically took surveys to understand the symptoms, severity, and virulence of the disease. Students also went to Whyville's Center for Disease Control (CDC), where they could model the time course of diseases and get vaccinated for Whypox. New additions to the game allow kids to design their own vaccines to protect against new infectious diseases as they occur. Further, the line between reality and Whyville has blurred. Computational neuroscientist and Whyville creator Jim Bower says, “During the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks, kids went into our CDC to try to predict what might happen on their own.” Technology today allows for virtual experiences unlike those of a decade ago. Yet the challenge of creating a storyline that both entertains and teaches remains the same. Americans ages 25–40 may fondly remember Oregon Trail, an educational game about 19th century pioneer life released on floppy disk in 1971. “The ideal game sets up an experience where students learn in spite of themselves,” says one of the three Oregon Trail creators, Don Rawitsch. “I think science is a rich opportunity for computer simulations. It's an opportunity to teach kids about how to approach investigations, how to think logically, and how to draw conclusions. These are skills that are useful whether the student takes up a career in science or not.” President Obama said in his address on STEM education, “Everyone in this room understands how important science and math can be. And it goes beyond the facts in a biology textbook or the questions on an algebra quiz. It's about the ability to understand our world, to harness and train that human capacity to solve problems and think critically, a set of skills that informs the decisions we make throughout our lives.” Ironically, the video games that kids have been neglecting their science homework to play can now be harnessed to make science—and scientific thinking—fun again."
