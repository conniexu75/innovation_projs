https://openalex.org/W1990859001,"A fossil skeleton of an early Eocene bat, the oldest known flying mammal, was found in southwest Wyoming. The bat is assigned to the new species Icaronycteris index of the suborder Microchiroptera. It was apparently of a young male whose body was buried in varved marls of the Green River Formation, on the bottom of Fossil Lake, about 50 million years ago. The bones, some as slender as a human hair, show a few ""primitive"" characteristics such as a clawed index finger and a complete phalangeal formula, but the bat was fully developed -an anatomically precocious contemporary of the dog-sized polydactylous horse."
https://openalex.org/W1993016725,The distant sea disturbances which followed the explosion of Krakatoa are correlated with recently discovered atmospheric acoustic and gravity modes having the same phase velocity as long waves on the ocean. The atmospheric waves jumped over the land barriers and reexcited the sea waves with amplitudes exceeding the hydrostatic values. An explosion of 100 to 150 megatons would be required to duplicate the Krakatoa atmosphericpressure pulse.

https://openalex.org/W2006703930,"2,6-Dimethyloctane and 2-methyl-3-ethylheptane were isolated from petroleum. These hydrocarbons which are present in relatively large amounts appear to be derived from the monoterpenoids."
https://openalex.org/W2020247101,"Many difficulties face the conventional interpretation of the red shift of quasars as a Hubble shift, with associated immense distances. These objects are not of galactic size or nature, and are not associated with galaxies or clusters of galaxies. The continuing energy source for such enormous powers for a period of 106 to 107 years has not been clearly revealed. The absence of the expected absorption for the Lyman-α spectral line of hydrogen is a new difficulty. Because of the relativistic limit on the diameter which can produce rapid fluctuations of light output, there may not be enough surface to radiate the required light."
https://openalex.org/W1985408167,"Rough fracture surfaces of extended-chain polyethylene crystals become unstable at temperatures below the bulk melting point. There is no way for the extended chains, which are up to 20,000 methylene units long, to change position without collapse. As a result, the rough surfaces smooth out on heating by covering themselves with oriented folded-chain lamellae."

https://openalex.org/W2026682706,"With main photoperiods of red or white light, the inhibition of flowering in Lemna perpusilla 6746 caused by interruptions of the night with red light cannot be reversed by far-red light, since far-red light itself is highly inhibitory. However, with a main photoperiod of blue light, far-red light is much less inhibitory and partially reverses the effect of red night-interruptions. If the main blue photoperiod is terminated by a brief red exposure, reversibility is abolished, as the far-red light is again fully inhibitory. This latter effect can be reversed by far-red light. These results add light quality to the already known characteristics of the main light period which affect reversibility in the dark period, and are consistent with the idea that the effects of blue light on photoperiodism in L. perpusilla are mediated exclusively by phytochrome."
https://openalex.org/W2094133705,Stimulated Brillouin shifts observed at 2.1 degrees K in quartz are the same as those observed at 293 degrees K. No extreme nonlinear behavior is observed. Recent anomalous results reported by Russian workers are shown to be due to the very strong stimulated Raman scattering that sets in at low temperatures.

https://openalex.org/W1987756439,"Earlier surveys in the Aleutian Trench southeast of Kodiak Island, Alaska, indicated that Kodiak Seamount had a flat top and was a tablemount or guyot. This seamount is of special significance because it has been supposed that its surface was eroded at the same time as those of a line of guyots to the southeast. If so, its present position in the axis of the Aleutian Trench indicates that the line of guyots was formed before the trench. A two-part survey in 1965 showed that Kodiak Seamount is not flat-topped, and should be eliminated from the category of guyots. Reflection profiling records indicate that the seamount was formed before the adjacent sediments were deposited, and that the small trough, or moat, on the south side is a depositional feature probably formed by a scouring effect or by the acceleration of turbidity currents around the base of the mount."

Inactivation results from conversion by oxidation of the plant hormone to polymerized deuterauxin, which is depolymerized by boiling of the solution, which restores activity."

https://openalex.org/W2181900642,"and extrinsic factors regulate the gastrointesti­ nal circulation? what relationship does this vasculature bear to the major functions of its organs? what role does it play in overall circulatory dy­ namics during health and disease? what new technics will be needed? I have elected to discuss certain publications dealing with the gastroin­ testinal circulation, judging these to be articles in the main stream of physiological research. Time may prove the necessary omission of other papers to have been serious. This is the risk of the review as opposed to the catalogue. The present chapter has been arranged to satisfy the tradi­ tional notions of a gastrointestinal physiologist, which stem from the con­ viction that gastrointestinal blood vessels belong to gastrointestinal organs and do not stand naked for the convenience of the circulatory scholar."
