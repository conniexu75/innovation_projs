An experimental analysis of this luminescent system supports the hypothesis that it functions by emitting light during the daytime, which matches the background light and thereby obscures the silhouette of the animal."

https://openalex.org/W2024563832,The global lunar gravity field was determined from a weighted least squares analysis of the averaged classical element of the five Lunar Orbiters.The observed-minus-computed residuals have been reduced by a factor of 10 from a previously derived gravity field.The values of the second-degree zonal and sectorial harmonics are compatible with those derived from libration data.

Their morphology is being studied according to methods developed in Russia. The discovery of successive different assemblages supports not only regional but also intercontinental stratigraphic correlations which are in agreement with available isotopic datings."
https://openalex.org/W2077162282,The mobilities of ions produced in electrical discharges in the presence of trace quantities of water vapor and sulfur dioxide are generally lower than those expected for simple ions. Mass spectrometric identification reveals that species composed of water vapor and sulfur dioxide molecules clustering about common atmospheric ions are formed under these conditions. The identification of these clusters provides an explanation for the effect of trace gases on the mobilities of ions.

Recent record catches in chronological sequence from the northern limit of range in Newfoundland to New York, while temperatures measured in Maine declined from higher to lower than optimum, suggest that at the present rate optimum conditions should reach the southern limit of the lobster's range by the mid-1970's."
https://openalex.org/W2036721006,"A polyatomic complex of iron-oxygen octahedral face-sharing triplets corner-linked to four other octahedra occurs in the atomic arrangements of the basic iron phosphates dufrenite, rockbridgeite, beraunite, and laubmannite. This complex is further knit together by the phosphate tetrahedra. The family of basic ferric phosphates arises from the variety of ways in which the complexes can be linked along a third ""variable"" crystallographic axis."
https://openalex.org/W2087304339,"Significant swelling (1 to 10 percent due to small voids have been found in stainless steel when it is exposed to fast neutron doses less than expected in commercial fast breeder reactors. The main features of this new effect are: (i) the voids are formed by the precipitation of a small fraction of the radiation-produced vacancies; (ii) the voids form primarily in the temperature range 400 degrees to 600 degrees C (750 degrees to 1100 degrees F); and (iii) the volume increases with dose (fluence) at a rate between linear and parabolic. The limited temperature range of void formation can be explained, but the effects of fluence, microstructure, and composition are determined by a competition between several kinetic processes that are not well understood. This swelling does not affect the feasibility or safety of the breeder reactor,but will have a significant impact on the core design and economics of the breeder.Preliminary results indicate that one cannot eliminate the effect,but cold-working,heat treatment, or small changes in composition can reduce the swelling by a factor of 2 or more. Testing is hampered by the fact that several years in EBR-II are required to accumulate the fluence expected in demonstration plants. Heavyion accelerators,which allow damage rates corresponding to much higher fluxes than those found in EBR-II,hold great promise for short-term tests that will indicate the relative effect of the important variables."
https://openalex.org/W2090314047,"The very name of my subject, economics, suggests economizing or maxi mizing. But Political Economy has gone a long way beyond home econo mics. Indeed, it is only in the last third of the century, within my own life time as a scholar, that economic theory has had many pretensions to being itself useful to the practical businessman or bureaucrat. I seem to recall that a great economist of the last generation, A. C. Pigou of Cam bridge University, once asked the rhetorical question, 'Who would ever think of employing an economist to run a brewery?' Well, today, under the guise of operational research and managerial economics, the fanciest of our economic tools are being utilized in enterprises both public and private. So at the very foundations of our subject maximization is involved. My old teacher, Joseph Schumpeter, went much farther. Instead of being content to say economics must borrow from logic and rational empirical enquiry, Schumpeter made the remarkable claim that man's ability to operate as a logical animal capable of systematic empirical induction was itself the direct outcome of the Darwinian struggle for survival. Just as man's thumb evolved in the struggle to make a living to meet his econo mic problem so did man's brain evolve in response to the economic problem. Coming forty years before the latest findings in ethology by Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen, this is a rather remarkable insight. It would take me away from my present subject to more than mention the further view enunciated by Schumpeter [43] in launching the new subject of econometrics. Quantity, he said, is studied by the physicist or other natural scientist at a fairly late and sophisticated stage of the subject. Since a quantitative approach is, so to speak, at the discretion of the investigator, all the more credit to the followers of Galileo and Newton for taking the mathematical approach. But in economics, said Schumpeter, the very subject matter presents itself in quantitative form : take away the numerical magnitude of price or barter exchange-ratio and you have nothing left. Accounting does not benefit from arithmetic;"

This model gives a value of 6054.8 kilometers for the radius of Venus, and agreement with brightness spectrum, radar cross sections, and results of microwave interferometry."

https://openalex.org/W2057158718,The three spin energy levels of divalent nickel impurity ions in sapphire interact strongly with ultrasonic waves whose frequency corresponds to certain allowed transitions between the levels. Under population inversion of the levels it is possible to achieve significant amplification of very high frequency ultrasonic waves by stimulated emission from the spin system.
https://openalex.org/W1965521605,"THE possibility that water has existed on the Moon for varying lengths of time, both in liquid arid in solid form, and both beneath the surface and on the surface, has been widely discussed during the past 10 years1â€“7. The subject has been discussed repeatedly at scientific meetings and has been received mostly with great scepticism. Evidence supporting this view has recently become quite overwhelming and, in fact, no communication seems necessary to point out the evidence from the Orbiter 4 and 5 pictures8. Because many people are not aware of this evidence and suggest that the effects are caused by other liquids, that is, lava, dust-gas or possibly even vodka, a brief discussion of the evidence may be in order."
