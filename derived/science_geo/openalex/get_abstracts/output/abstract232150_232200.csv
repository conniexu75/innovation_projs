https://openalex.org/W2101543035,"Gene silencing through RNA interference (RNAi) is carried out by RISC, the RNA-induced silencing complex. RISC contains two signature components, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Argonaute family proteins. Here, we show that the multiple Argonaute proteins present in mammals are both biologically and biochemically distinct, with a single mammalian family member, Argonaute2, being responsible for messenger RNA cleavage activity. This protein is essential for mouse development, and cells lacking Argonaute2 are unable to mount an experimental response to siRNAs. Mutations within a cryptic ribonuclease H domain within Argonaute2, as identified by comparison with the structure of an archeal Argonaute protein, inactivate RISC. Thus, our evidence supports a model in which Argonaute contributes “Slicer” activity to RISC, providing the catalytic engine for RNAi."
https://openalex.org/W2016710415,"Gefitinib (Iressa, Astra Zeneca Pharmaceuticals) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and induces dramatic clinical responses in nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) with activating mutations within the EGFR kinase domain. We report that these mutant EGFRs selectively activate Akt and signal transduction and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways, which promote cell survival, but have no effect on extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, which induces proliferation. NSCLC cells expressing mutant EGFRs underwent extensive apoptosis after small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of the mutant EGFR or treatment with pharmacological inhibitors of Akt and STAT signaling and were relatively resistant to apoptosis induced by conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. Thus, mutant EGFRs selectively transduce survival signals on which NSCLCs become dependent; inhibition of those signals by gefitinib may contribute to the drug's efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2057563627,"We report the observation of a one-dimensional (1D) Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas of bosons moving freely in 1D. Although TG gas bosons are strongly interacting, they behave very much like noninteracting fermions. We enter the TG regime with cold rubidium-87 atoms by trapping them with a combination of two light traps. By changing the trap intensities, and hence the atomic interaction strength, the atoms can be made to act either like a Bose-Einstein condensate or like a TG gas. We measure the total 1D energy and the length of the gas. With no free parameters and over a wide range of coupling strengths, our data fit the exact solution for the ground state of a 1D Bose gas."
https://openalex.org/W2057293794,"Recombinant mouse prion protein (recMoPrP) produced in Escherichia coli was polymerized into amyloid fibrils that represent a subset of β sheet–rich structures. Fibrils consisting of recMoPrP(89–230) were inoculated intracerebrally into transgenic (Tg) mice expressing MoPrP(89–231). The mice developed neurologic dysfunction between 380 and 660 days after inoculation. Brain extracts showed protease-resistant PrP by Western blotting; these extracts transmitted disease to wild-type FVB mice and Tg mice overexpressing PrP, with incubation times of 150 and 90 days, respectively. Neuropathological findings suggest that a novel prion strain was created. Our results provide compelling evidence that prions are infectious proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2084271911,"The plastic behavior of crystalline materials is mainly controlled by the nucleation and motion of lattice dislocations. We report in situ dynamic transmission electron microscope observations of nanocrystalline nickel films with an average grain size of about 10 nanometers, which show that grain boundary–mediated processes have become a prominent deformation mode. Additionally, trapped lattice dislocations are observed in individual grains following deformation. This change in the deformation mode arises from the grain size–dependent competition between the deformation controlled by nucleation and motion of dislocations and the deformation controlled by diffusion-assisted grain boundary processes."
https://openalex.org/W2025540191,"In an edaphically heterogeneous area in the Peruvian Amazon, clay soils and nutrient-poor white sands each harbor distinctive plant communities. To determine whether a trade-off between growth and antiherbivore defense enforces habitat specialization on these two soil types, we conducted a reciprocal transplant study of seedlings of 20 species from sixgenera of phylogenetically independent pairs of edaphic specialist trees and manipulated the presence of herbivores. Clay specialist species grew significantly faster than white-sand specialists in both soil types when protected from herbivores. However, when unprotected, white-sand specialists dominated in white-sand forests and clay specialists dominated in clay forests. Therefore, habitat specialization in this system results from an interaction of herbivore pressure with soil type."

The entire genome sequence of this Gram-positive bacterium encodes 2333 putative genes and revealed numerous gene products involved in degrading host molecules, including sialidases, neuraminidases, endoglycoceramidases, lipases, and pore-forming factors. Surface-associated and other immunogenic factors have been identified, which might be involved in triggering acne inflammation and other P. acnes-associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1968079032,"Interface-selective probing of magnetism is a key issue for the design and realization of spin-electronic junction devices. Here, magnetization-induced second-harmonic generation was used to probe the local magnetic properties at the interface of the perovskite ferromagnet La 0.6 Sr 0.4 MnO 3 with nonmagnetic insulating layers, as used in spin-tunnel junctions. We show that by grading the doping profile on an atomic scale at the interface, robust ferromagnetism can be realized around room temperature. The results should lead to improvements in the performance of spin-tunnel junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2016675261,"We describe a new genus, Osedax, and two new species of annelids with females that consume the bones of dead whales via ramifying roots. Molecular and morphological evidence revealed that Osedax belongs to the Siboglinidae, which includes pogonophoran and vestimentiferan worms from deep-sea vents, seeps, and anoxic basins. Osedax has skewed sex ratios with numerous dwarf (paedomorphic) males that live in the tubes of females. DNA sequences reveal that the two Osedax species diverged about 42 million years ago and currently maintain large populations ranging from 10(5) to 10(6) adult females."
https://openalex.org/W2033962173,"Expression of Snail transcriptional factor is a determinant in the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype by epithelial tumor cells. However, the regulation of the transcription of this gene is still unknown. We describe here the characterization of a human SNAIL promoter that contains the initiation of transcription and regulates the expression of this gene in tumor cells. This promoter was activated in cell lines in response to agents that induce Snail transcription and the mesenchymal phenotype, as addition of the phorbol ester PMA or overexpression of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) or oncogenes such as Ha-ras or v-Akt. Although other regions of the promoter were required for a complete stimulation by Akt or ILK, a minimal fragment (−78/+59) was sufficient to maintain the mesenchymal specificity. Activity of this minimal promoter and SNAIL RNA levels were dependent on ERK signaling pathway. NFκB/p65 also stimulated SNAIL transcription through a region located immediately upstream the minimal promoter, between −194 and −78. These results indicate that Snail transcription is driven by signaling pathways known to induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition, reinforcing the role of Snail in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2074613129,"Hartnup disorder, an autosomal recessive defect named after an English family described in 1956 (ref. 1), results from impaired transport of neutral amino acids across epithelial cells in renal proximal tubules and intestinal mucosa. Symptoms include transient manifestations of pellagra (rashes), cerebellar ataxia and psychosis1,2. Using homozygosity mapping in the original family in whom Hartnup disorder was discovered, we confirmed that the critical region for one causative gene was located on chromosome 5p15 (ref. 3). This region is homologous to the area of mouse chromosome 13 that encodes the sodium-dependent amino acid transporter B0AT1 (ref. 4). We isolated the human homolog of B0AT1, called SLC6A19, and determined its size and molecular organization. We then identified mutations in SLC6A19 in members of the original family in whom Hartnup disorder was discovered and of three Japanese families. The protein product of SLC6A19, the Hartnup transporter, is expressed primarily in intestine and renal proximal tubule and functions as a neutral amino acid transporter."

https://openalex.org/W1965204257,"Hartnup disorder (OMIM 234500) is an autosomal recessive abnormality of renal and gastrointestinal neutral amino acid transport noted for its clinical variability. We localized a gene causing Hartnup disorder to chromosome 5p15.33 and cloned a new gene, SLC6A19, in this region. SLC6A19 is a sodium-dependent and chloride-independent neutral amino acid transporter, expressed predominately in kidney and intestine, with properties of system B(0). We identified six mutations in SLC6A19 that cosegregated with disease in the predicted recessive manner, with most affected individuals being compound heterozygotes. The disease-causing mutations that we tested reduced neutral amino acid transport function in vitro. Population frequencies for the most common mutated SLC6A19 alleles are 0.007 for 517G --> A and 0.001 for 718C --> T. Our findings indicate that SLC6A19 is the long-sought gene that is mutated in Hartnup disorder; its identification provides the opportunity to examine the inconsistent multisystemic features of this disorder."
https://openalex.org/W2147059663,"Retroviral DNA can be subjected to cytosine-to-uracil editing through the action of members of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases. Here we demonstrate that APOBEC-mediated cytidine deamination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) virion RNA can also occur. We speculate that the natural substrates of the APOBEC enzymes may extend to RNA viruses that do not replicate through DNA intermediates. Thus, cytosine-to-uracil editing may contribute to the sequence diversification of many viruses."
https://openalex.org/W1964846910,"The Drosophila melanogaster lymph gland is a hematopoietic organ and, together with prospective vascular cells (cardioblasts) and excretory cells (pericardial nephrocytes), arises from the cardiogenic mesoderm. Clonal analysis provided evidence for a hemangioblast that can give rise to two daughter cells: one that differentiates into heart or aorta and another that differentiates into blood. In addition, the GATA factor gene pannier (pnr) and the homeobox gene tinman (tin), which are controlled by the convergence of Decapentaplegic (Dpp), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Wingless (Wg) and Notch signaling, are required for the development of all cardiogenic mesoderm, including the lymph gland. Here we show that an essential genetic switch that differentiates between the blood or nephrocyte and vascular lineages involves the Notch pathway. Further specification occurs through specific expression of the GATA factor Serpent (Srp) in the lymph-gland primordium. Our findings suggest that there is a close parallel between the molecular mechanisms functioning in the D. melanogaster cardiogenic mesoderm and those functioning in the mammalian aorta-gonadal-mesonephros mesoderm."
https://openalex.org/W2061092318,"The motor protein kinesin moves along microtubules, driven by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis. However, it remains unclear how kinesin converts the chemical energy into mechanical movement. We report crystal structures ofmonomeric kinesin KIF1A with three transition-state analogs: adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP)–vanadate, and ADP-AlFx (aluminofluoride complexes). These structures, together with known structures of the ADP-bound state and the adenylyl-(β,γ-methylene) diphosphate (AMP-PCP)–bound state, show that kinesin uses two microtubule-binding loops in an alternating manner to change its interaction with microtubules during the ATP hydrolysis cycle; loop L11 is extended in the AMP-PNP structure, whereas loop L12 is extended in the ADP structure. ADP-vanadate displays an intermediate structure in which a conformational change in two switch regions causes both loops to be raised from the microtubule, thus actively detaching kinesin."
https://openalex.org/W2066379345,"The γ-secretase complex catalyzes the final intramembraneous cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein, liberating the neurotoxic amyloid β-peptide implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Apart from the catalytic subunit presenilin (PS), three additional subunits, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2, have been identified. In mammals, two PS homologues, PS1 and PS2, which are part of distinct γ-secretase complexes, exist. Likewise, two APH-1 homologues, APH-1a and APH-1b, have been identified. Furthermore, two APH-1a splice forms, APH-1aS and APH-1aL, have been reported. Here we show that both APH-1a splice forms and APH-1b are expressed in peripheral and neuronal cells. APH-1aS, APH-1aL, and APH-1b form separate, proteolytically active γ-secretase complexes containing either one of the two PSs. Deficiency of APH-1a caused a decrease in nicastrin, PS, and PEN-2 levels and an increase in the levels of APH-1b, whereas deficiency of APH-1b did not affect the levels of APH-1a or the other complex components. Consistent with this finding, we found that deficiency of APH-1a was associated with reduced γ-secretase activity, whereas deficiency of APH-1b was not. Thus, APH-1b γ-secretase complexes may fulfill redundant functions. Taken together, our results suggest that, dependent on the tissue expression of the individual subunits, six distinct γ-secretase complexes composed of the known subunits can exist in human cells.

Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 297: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10627) Google Scholar). Aβ is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), a type I transmembrane protein, in two steps (2Haass C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). APP is first cleaved in its ectodomain by the aspartyl protease β-secretase, generating the membrane-retained C-terminal 99-amino acid fragment C99. C99 then becomes the substrate for a second aspartyl protease, γ-secretase, which cleaves C99 in its transmembrane domain to release Aβ and the APP intracellular domain. Over the last few years it has been shown that γ-secretase processes a number of other type I transmembrane proteins that undergo APP-like proteolytic processing (3De Strooper B. Neuron. 2003; 38: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Most notable among the other γ-secretase substrates is the cell surface receptor Notch-1 (4De Strooper B.

Control cells were generated by stable co-transfection of pBSENU6 and pcDNA3.1/Hygro(–) and selected as above.

For co-immunoprecipitation analysis, membrane fractions were solubilized in CHAPSO-lysis buffer (1% CHAPSO, 150 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, and protease inhibitors (Sigma)), subjected to a clarifying spin by ultracentrifugation, and incubated with the indicated antibodies and protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Following two washes in CHAPSO-wash buffer (0.5% CHAPSO and 150 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4), the immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. γ-Secretase Assays—In vitro γ-secretase assays using HEK293 cells and γ-secretase reporter gene assays in yeast were carried out essentially as described (6Edbauer D.

To facilitate the characterization of the various forms of the γ-secretase complex subunit APH-1 in more detail, we generated antibody 434 to the C terminus of the long splice form of APH-1a and antibody 435 to the C terminus of APH-1b (Fig. 1a). In addition, we generated antibody 2021 to the loop 3 domain (40Fortna R.R. Crystal A.S. Morais V.A. Pijak D.S. Lee V.M. Doms R.W. J. Biol.

HEK293 cells stably expressing Swedish mutant APP (HEK293/sw) were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding APH-1aS, APH-1aM, APH-1aL, and APH-1b. Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting with the above-described antibodies. As expected, antibody 434 specifically detected APH-1aL but not APH-1aS and APH-1aM (Fig. 1b). In addition to the specific detection of the monomeric form of APH-1aL, aggregated forms were observed (Fig. 1b). These aggregated forms were generally observed upon transient overexpression of APH-1 variants (Fig. 1, b, c, and d). Endogenous APH-1aL was under the detection limit in cell lysates (Fig. 1b). However, robust amounts of endogenous APH-1aL could be detected when membrane fractions of HEK293/sw cells were analyzed (Fig. 1b). As expected, all three transiently expressed APH-1a splice forms were detected with the APH-1a antibody 2021 (Fig. 1c). Similarly as with antibody 434, we failed to detect endogenous APH-1a with antibody 2021 in cell lysates, although it could be detected in membrane fractions of HEK293/sw cells (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, the levels of APH-1aS were higher than the levels of APH-1aL in HEK293 cells, indicating that APH-1aS represents the major APH-1a splice variant in these cells (Fig. 1c). No evidence for the existence of the APH-1aM variant in HEK293 cells was obtained (Fig. 1c, lower section of panel). The absence of the APH-1aM and the presence of the APH-1aS splice variant was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR coupled with AluI restriction analysis, which allo"

We report here that host PAI-1, at physiological concentration, promotes in vivo tumor invasion and angiogenesis. In sharp contrast, inhibition of tumor vascularization was observed when PAI-1 was produced at supraphysiologic levels, either by host cells (transgenic mice overexpressing PAI-1) or by tumor cells (after transfection with murine PAI-1 cDNA). This study provides for the first time in vivo evidence for a dose-dependent effect of PAI-1 on tumor angiogenesis. Of great interest is the finding that PAI-1 produced by tumor cells, even at high concentration, did not overcome the absence of PAI-1 in the host, emphasizing the importance of the cellular source of PAI-1."
https://openalex.org/W2082169879,"Treatment of cells with microtubule inhibitors results in activation of the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, leading to mitotic arrest before anaphase. Upon prolonged treatment, however, cells can adapt and exit mitosis aberrantly, resulting in the occurrence of tetraploid cells in G1. Those cells subsequently arrest in postmitotic G1 due to the activation of a p53-dependent G1 checkpoint. Failure of the G1 checkpoint leads to endoreduplication and further polyploidization. Using HCT116 and isogenic p53-deficient or spindle checkpoint compromised derivatives, we show here that not only p53 but also a functional spindle assembly checkpoint is required for postmitotic G1 checkpoint function. During transient mitotic arrest, p53 stabilization and activation is triggered by a pathway independent of ATM/ATR, Chk1 and Chk2. We further show that a prolonged spindle checkpoint-mediated mitotic arrest is required for proper postmitotic G1 checkpoint function. In addition, we demonstrate that polyploid cells are inhibited to re-enter mitosis by an additional checkpoint acting in G2. Thus, during a normal cell cycle, polyploidization and subsequent aneuploidization is prevented by the function of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, a p53-dependent G1 checkpoint and an additional G2 checkpoint."

Both PARP-1 and DNA-PK have been identified as therapeutic targets for anticancer drug development. Here we investigate the effects of specific inhibitors on enzyme activities and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. The enzyme activities were investigated using purified enzymes and in permeabilized cells. Inhibition, or loss of activity, was compared using potent inhibitors of DNA-PK (NU7026) and PARP-1 (AG14361), and cell lines proficient or deficient for DNA-PK or PARP-1. Inactive DNA-PK suppressed the activity of PARP-1 and vice versa. This was not the consequence of simple substrate competition, since DNA ends were provided in excess. The inhibitory effect of DNA-PK on PARP activity was confirmed in permeabilized cells. Both inhibitors prevented ionizing radiation-induced DSB repair, but only AG14361 prevented single-strand break repair. An increase in DSB levels caused by inhibition of PARP-1 was shown to be caused by a decrease in DSB repair, and not by the formation of additional DSBs. These data point to combined inhibition of PARP-1 and DNA-PK as a powerful strategy for tumor radiosensitization."

Here we identify Dok-6, a novel member of the Dok-4/5 subclass of the p62 Dok family of intracellular adaptor molecules, and characterize its interaction with Ret. Expression analysis reveals that Dok-6 is highly expressed in the developing central nervous system and is co-expressed with Ret in several locations, including sympathetic, sensory, and parasympathetic ganglia, as well as in the ureteric buds of the developing kidneys. Pull-down assays using the Dok-6 phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain and GDNF-activated Ret indicate that Dok-6 binds to the phosphorylated Ret Tyr1062 residue. Moreover, ligand activation of Ret resulted in phosphorylation of tyrosine residue(s) located within the unique C terminus of Dok-6 predominantly through a Src-dependent mechanism, indicating that Dok-6 is a substrate of the Ret-Src signaling pathway. Interestingly, expression of Dok-6 potentiated GDNF-induced neurite outgrowth in GDNF family receptor α1 (GFRα1)-expressing Neuro2A cells that was dependent upon the C-terminal residues of Dok-6. Taken together, these data identify Dok-6 as a novel Dok-4/5-related adaptor molecule that may function in vivo to transduce signals that regulate Ret-mediated processes such as axonal projection."

https://openalex.org/W2021860656,"STAT transcription factors (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are cytoplasmic proteins that induce gene activation in response to cytokine receptor stimulation. Following tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT proteins translocate into the nucleus and activate specific target genes. We have previously reported that STAT3 activates the expression of the p21waf1 gene through its association with the NcoA/SRC1a and CBP coactivators. In this study, we explore the role of BRG1, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, and the role of cdk9, a component of the elongation factor P-TEFb, in the STAT3-mediated expression of p21waf1. We found using pull-down experiments and co-immunoprecipitation assays that both proteins associate with STAT3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments indicate that STAT3 DNA binding results in histone H3 acetylation and BRG1 recruitment. Using Southern blot analysis, we found that the loading of BRG1 is followed by an increased accessibility of the proximal p21waf1 promoter and by the association of RNA polymerase II. As a next step, STAT3 then recruits the cdk9 kinase to phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase at serine 2. Accordingly, the elongating form of the polymerase can be detected by ChIP experiments on the coding region of the gene, probably initiating mRNA synthesis. Therefore, STAT3 not only promotes the initiation of transcription but also regulates chromatin remodeling and transcription elongation through its interaction with BRG1 and cdk9."

https://openalex.org/W1980538904,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been subdivided into two types based on clinical and genetic findings: primary tumors, which arise de novo, and secondary tumors, which progress from lower grade gliomas to GBMs. To analyse this dichotomy at the protein level, we employed selective tissue microdissection to obtain pure populations of tumor cells, which we studied using two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) and protein sequencing of select target proteins. Protein patterns were analysed in a blinded manner from the clinical and genetic data. 2-DGE clearly identified two distinct populations of tumors. 2-DGE was reproducible and reliable, as multiple samples analysed from the same patient gave identical results. In addition, we isolated and sequenced 11 proteins that were uniquely expressed in either the primary or the secondary GBMs, but not both. We demonstrate that specific proteomic patterns can be reproducibly identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis from limited numbers of selectively procured, microdissected tumor cells and that two patterns of GBMs, primary versus secondary, previously distinguished by clinical and genetic differences, can be recognized at the protein level. Proteins that are expressed distinctively may have important implications for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients with GBM."
https://openalex.org/W2004569578,"Stimulation of resting W53 cells (lymphoid murine cells expressing prolactin (PRL) receptor) by PRL induced expression of growth-related immediate-early genes (IEG), and proliferation through activation of the Src kinases. Since IEG are essential for cell cycle progression, we have studied how PRL controls expression of c-Myc mRNA and c-Fos. Stimulation of W53 cell proliferation by PRL required activation of MAPK, as the Mek1/2 inhibitor PD184352 eliminated Erk1/2 stimulation, cell proliferation, and expression of c-Fos mRNA. In contrast, PD184352 did not alter PRL activation of c-Myc mRNA expression or stimulation of p70S6K, Akt, and the Jak2/Stat5 pathway. Activation of the PI3K by PRL was necessary for the expression of c-MycmRNA and W53 cell proliferation, as the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 abolished them. However, it did not modify PRL stimulation of c-Fos mRNA expression or activation of Erk1/2 and Stat5. Furthermore, rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR and consequently of p70S6K, did not alter PRL stimulation of c-Myc and c-Fos mRNA expression and it had a very minor inhibitory effect on PRL stimulation of W53 cell proliferation. In addition, rapamycin did not affect PRL stimulation of Akt or Stat5. However, it reinforced PRL activation of Erk1/2. Overexpression of a constitutively activated Akt (myristoylated Akt) in W53 cells overcame the inhibitory effect of LY294002 on c-Myc expression, as well as cell death upon PRL deprivation. Consistently, inducible expression of Akt-CAAX Box in W53 cells caused inhibition of c-Myc expression. PRL stimulation of W53 cells resulted in Akt translocation to the nucleus, phosphorylation of FKHRL1 transcription factor, and its nuclear exclusion. In contrast, induced expression of Akt-CAAX Box caused inhibition of FKHRL1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, transient expression of nonphosphorylatable FKHRL1-A3 mutant impaired PRL-induced activation of the c-Myc promoter. Akt activation also resulted in phosphorylation and inhibition of glycogen synthetase kinase 3 (GSK3), which in turn promoted c-Myc stability. Consistently, treatment of W53 with selective inhibitors of GSK3 such as SB415286 and lithium salts resulted in increased levels of c-Myc. Also, overexpression of c-Myc in W53 cells overcame the decrease in cell proliferation induced by LY294002. These findings defined a PRL-signalling cascade in W53 cells, involving Src kinases/PI3K/Akt/FKHRL1-GSK3, that mediates stimulation of c-Myc expression."
https://openalex.org/W1984485808,"The Wilms' tumor 1 gene (WT1) plays an essential role in urogenital development and malignancy. Through DNA binding, WT1 can either enhance or repress transcription depending on the context of the DNA-binding sites or the cell type in which it is expressed. WT1 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, including leukemia and breast cancer; in these diseases, the expression of WT1 is associated with a poor prognosis. To determine how WT1 affects c-myc expression in the context of breast cancer cells, we have examined the ability of both endogenous and exogenous WT1 proteins in breast cancer cells to bind to the c-myc promoter in vivo. Using c-myc-promoter-driven luciferase constructs, we found that different forms of WT1 could enhance the expression of the reporter. Unlike other studies where WT1 is reported to be a negative regulator of c-myc, we found that both the - and + KTS forms of WT1 could act to enhance c-myc expression, depending on the cell type. The WT1-binding site near the second major transcription start site of the c-myc promoter was confirmed to be involved in upregulation of human c-myc by WT1. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpression of WT1 induced a significant increase in the abundance of endogenous c-myc protein in breast cancer cells, consistent with the upregulation of c-myc transcription following WT1 induction. These observations strongly argue that in the case of breast cancer WT1 is functioning as an oncogene in part by stimulating the expression of c-myc."
https://openalex.org/W2125698716,"Pamidronate (PAM) and zoledronic acid (ZOL) are aminobisphosphonates (BPs) able to affect the isoprenylation of intracellular small G proteins. We have investigated the antitumor activity of BPs and R115777 farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) against epidermoid cancer cells. In human epidermoid head and neck KB and lung H1355 cancer cells, 48 h exposure to PAM and ZOL induced growth inhibition (IC(50) 25 and 10 microM, respectively) and apoptosis and abolished the proliferative and antiapoptotic stimuli induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF). In these experimental conditions, ZOL induced apoptosis through the activation of caspase 3 and a clear fragmentation of PARP was also demonstrated. A strong decrease of basal ras activity and an antagonism on its stimulation by EGF was recorded in the tumor cells exposed to BPs. These effects were paralleled by impaired activation of the survival enzymes extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (Erk-1/2) and Akt that were not restored by EGF. Conversely, farnesol induced a recovery of ras activity and antagonized the proapoptotic effects induced by BPs. The combined treatment with BPs and R115777 resulted in a strong synergism both in growth inhibition and apoptosis in KB and H1355 cells. The synergistic activity between the drugs allowed BPs to produce tumor cell growth inhibition and apoptosis at in vivo achievable concentrations (0.1 micromolar for both drugs). Moreover, the combination was highly effective in the inhibition of ras, Erk and Akt activity, while farnesol again antagonized these effects. In conclusion, the combination of BPs and FTI leads to enhanced antitumor activity at clinically achievable drug concentrations that resides in the inhibition of farnesylation-dependent survival pathways and warrants further studies for clinical translation."

https://openalex.org/W2051821952,"Fusion proteins containing the amino-terminal domain of human p14(ARF) linked to green fluorescent protein are able to bind MDM2 and stabilize p53 without localization in the nucleolus. However, these fusion proteins are inherently unstable, with half-lives considerably shorter than either authentic ARF or chimaeras containing the entire coding domain, both of which are predominantly nucleolar. We present evidence that the unstable fusion proteins are significantly stabilized if redirected to the nucleolus by addition of a basic motif based on the nuclear localization signal of SV40 T-antigen. Moreover, the stability of these proteins can be enhanced by modulating the functions of MDM2 and p53. These data are consistent with a model in which ARF interacts with MDM2 in the nucleoplasm but is consequently subject to proteasomal degradation. Nucleolar localization may serve to store or stabilize ARF."

https://openalex.org/W1964853280,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is vital for Cl– andHCO3− transport in many epithelia. As theHCO3− concentration in epithelial secretions varies and can reach as high as 140 mm, the lumen-facing domains of CFTR are exposed to large reciprocal variations in Cl– andHCO3− levels. We have investigated whether changes in the extracellular anionic environment affects the activity of CFTR using the patch clamp technique. In fast whole cell current recordings, the replacement of 100 mm external Cl– (CI0−) withHCO3−, Br–,NO3− or aspartate– inhibited inward CFTR current (Cl– efflux) by ∼50% in a reversible manner. LoweringCI0− alone by iso-osmotic replacement with mannitol also reduced Cl– efflux to a similar extent. The maximal inhibition of CFTR current was ∼70%. Raising cytosolic calcium shifted the Cl– dose-inhibition curve to the left but did not alter the maximal current inhibition observed. In contrast, a reduction in the internal [Cl–] neither inhibited CFTR nor altered the block caused by reducedCI0−. Single channel recordings from outside-out patches showed that loweringCI0− markedly reduced channel open probability with little effect on unitary conductance. Together, these results indicate that alterations inCI0− alone and not theCl−/HCO3− ratio regulate the gating of CFTR.

Dephosphorylation of CFTR by membrane-bound protein phosphatases is also important in the physiological regulation of channel activity (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W.

Although CF is generally considered to result from a defect in Cl– transport, most of the affected epithelia also transportHCO3− ions. Indeed, recent work suggests that there is a better correlation between defects in CFTR-dependentHCO3− transport than defects in Cl– transport and the severity of disease (10Choi J.Y. Muallem D. Kiselyov K. Lee M.G. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. Nature. 2001; 41: 94-97Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar).HCO3− is an important component of epithelial secretions and, via its buffering role, controls the pH at the epithelial cell surface. It has been reported that CF-affected epithelia, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, secrete fluid with a more acidic pH than normal epithelia (11Kopelman H. Corey M. Gaskin K. Durie P. Weizman Z. Forstner G. Gastroenterology. 1988; 95: 349-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 12Robinson P.J. Smith A.L. Sly P.D. Dig. Dis.

Krouse M.E. Joo N.S. Wu J.V. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). An acidic luminal environment affects the physical properties of mucus (16Veerman E.C. Valentijn-Benz M.

Rev. 1999; 79: S215-S255Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). As many CF-affected epithelia normally secrete substantial amounts ofHCO3−, the luminalHCO3− concentration will vary under different physiological situations. This is particularly the case for the pancreas, a tissue in which CFTR is highly expressed and is severely affected in CF. Although plasmaHCO3− is ∼25 mm, the concentration ofHCO3− in pancreatic juice can reach ∼140 mm in humans, and because pancreatic juice is isotonic with plasma, these highHCO3− concentrations are accompanied by a reciprocal fall in juice Cl– concentration (21Argent B.E. Case R.M. Johnson E.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 1473-1497Google Scholar, 22Argent B.E. Gray M.A. Sirica A.E. Longnecker D.S. Biliary and Pancreatic Ductal Epithelia. Pathobiology and Pathophysiology. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1997: 349-377Google Scholar). Thus under physiological conditions, the apical surface of pancreatic duct cells and therefore the extracellular face of CFTR will be exposed to large variations in external Cl– (CI0−) andHCO3− (HCO3o−) concentrations. A similar but less extreme situation is also likely to exist in many otherHCO3−-transporting epithelia, such as the small intestine (12Robinson P.J. Smith A.L. Sly P.D. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1990; 35: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), airways (15Irokawa T. Krouse M.E. Joo N.S. Wu J.V. Wine J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 23Smith J.J.

Chan L.N. Zhao W.C. Chung Y.W. Chan H.C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have previously shown using fast whole cell patch clamp recordings (fWCR) that raising extracellularHCO3− inhibits CFTR currents in native guinea pig pancreatic duct cells (26O'Reilly C.M. Winpenny J.P. Argent B.E. Gray M.A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our data showed that increasingHCO3o− caused an inhibition of both inward and outward CFTR currents. The inhibition of outward current (Cl– influx) was expected asCI0− was replaced by the less permeantHCO3−ion. However, the inhibition of inward current (Cl– efflux) was surprising as the intracellular Cl– concentration should remain constant because of the large Cl– reservoir in the pipette and currents would not have been predicted to alter from simple theories of ion flow through channels. Thus replacing external Cl– withHCO3− resulted in “trans-inhibition” of Cl– efflux through CFTR. The inhibitory effect ofHCO3− was concentration-dependent, and ∼70% of the CFTR conductance was inhibited in the presence of 140 mmHCO3−. CFTR inhibition was not caused by changes in either extracellular or intracellular pH or in either the pCO2 orCO32− content of theHCO3−-rich solutions. We proposed that this effect ofHCO3o− on CFTR was a novel negative feedback mechanism for the control ofHCO3− secretion and thus the luminal surface pH in epithelia (26O'Reilly C.M. Winpenny J.P. Argent B.E. Gray M.A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). That external anions can modulate CFTR function is also supported by the recent report of Shcheynikov et al. (27Shcheynikov N. Kim K.H. Kim K.-M. Dorwart M.R. Ko S.B.H. Goto H. Naruse S. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21857-21865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These authors found that reducingCIo− to below 20 mm caused a remarkable time-dependent increase in the OH–HCO3− permeability of oocytes transfected with CFTR. This switch inHCO3− selectivity was suggested to arise from a conformational change in the CFTR protein, which may involve an external Cl– binding site on the ion channel (27Shcheynikov N. Kim K.H. Kim K.-M. Dorwart M.R. Ko S.B.H. Goto H. Naruse S. Thomas P.J. Muallem S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21857-21865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This effect ofCIo− is consistent with our previous proposal (26O'Reilly C.M. Winpenny J.P. Argent B.E. Gray M.A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) that an extracellular “anion” binding site on CFTR is important for modulating channel function. The main aim of this study was to clarify whether the inhibitory effect ofHCO3− on CFTR that we previously observed was specific to the pancreatic duct. We did this by working with human CFTR heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. We also wanted to determine whether the trans-inhibition of CFTR is caused solely by the increase in externalHCO3− concentration, by the reciprocal fall inCIo−, or by both mechanisms. And finally we wished to investigate whether trans-inhibition was due to an effect on channel gating or on the rate of Cl– permeation through the CFTR pore. To do this, we employed excised outside-out membrane patches and studied the effects of changingCIo− on single channel activity. Cells and Electrophysiology—CHO and BHK cells, stably transfected with human wild type CFTR, were grown as previously described (2Tabcharani J.A. Chang X.B. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 28Gong X. Linsdell P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 673-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on glass coverslips for use in patch clamp experiments between 2 and 5 days after plating. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were carried out at room temperature as described previously (26O'Reilly C.M. Winpenny J.P. Argent B.E. Gray M.A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An EPC-7 amplifier (List Electronic, Darmstadt, Germany) was used to record currents from CHO or BHK cells. Two configurations of the whole cell technique were used: 1) fWCR in which physical and electrical access to the cell is obtained by rupturing the patch of membrane underneath the patch pipette and 2) the slow whole cell (sWCR), a perforated patch recording technique in which a pore-forming antibiotic is included in the pipette solution. In this case, electrical access is obtained after sufficient integration of the antibiotic into the plasma membrane. In both configurations, whole cell currents were monitored using two different voltage protocols. For monitoring time-dependent changes in currents, the membrane potential (Vm) was held at 0 mV and alternately clamped to ±60 mV for 1 s with a 1-s hold at 0 mV between each pulse. Steady-state current-voltage (I/V) relationships were obtained by holding Vm at 0 mV and clamping to ±100 mV in 20-mV increments for 500 ms with an 800-ms interval between each pulse. Data were filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 2 kHz with a CED 1401 interface (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Reversal potentials (Erev) and current densities were determined from I/V plots after fitting a third order polynomial using regression analysis. Mean current amplitudes were calculated at Erev ± 60 mV and normalized to cell capacitance (pF) measured using the EPC-7 amplifier. The relative permeability (Px–/PCl–) for each anion (X–) compared with Cl– was determined from changes in Erev (26O'Reilly C.M. Winpenny J.P. Argent B.E. Gray M.A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Outside out, single channel experiments were conducted on BHK cells at room temperature as described previously (28Gong X. Linsdell P. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 673-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) at a Vm of –50 mV. Single channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), filtered at 50 Hz, and digitized at 1 kHz using pCLAMP8 software (Axon Instruments). Channel activity was quantified by measuring the mean number of channels open (NPo) during recordings lasting between 1–3 min at each Cl– concentration. In all of the experiments, Vm was corrected for liquid junction potentials. Solutions—For fWCR, the standard pipette solution contained as follows: 110 mm CsCl; 5 mm EGTA; 10 mm HEPES; 2 mm MgCl2; and 1 mm Na2ATP (pH 7.2 with CsOH) (240 mosm). For experiments in which intracellular [Cl–] was varied, CsCl was replaced with equimolar N-methyl-d-glucamine-Cl) or iso-osmolar mannitol. To achieve a free Ca2+ concentration in the pipette solution of 10–7m, 2.12 mm CaCl2 was added to the standard solution. For perforated patch sWCR, 240 μg/ml amphotericin B was added to the standard pipette solution with the Na2ATP omitted. The pipette solution used in outside out patch experiments contained the following: 110 mm CsCl; 10 mm HEPES; 5 mm EGTA; 1 mm MgCl2; 2.12 mm CaCl2; 1 mm MgATP; and 50 nm protein kinase A (Promega, Madison, WI), pH 7.2 with CsOH. The standard bath solution in all of the experiments contained 145 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4 with NaOH. For anion replacement studies, NaCl in the standard bath solution was replaced with equimolar concentrations of sodiumHCO3−, Br–, NO–3, or aspartate–. When using NaHCO3 solutions, CaCl2 was omitted to prevent precipitation.HCO3− containing solutions were not routinely gassed with CO2, so their pH was higher than that of the standard bath solution (pH 7.4). For the reduced [Cl–] bath solutions, NaCl was removed from the standard bath solution and replaced with sufficient mannitol to maintain osmolarity as measured using an osmometer. 2 mm CaCl2 was omitted to ensure that the solution was comparable with theHCO3− substitution experiments. During WCR, CFTR was activated using 5 μm forskolin (Tocris, Avonmouth, United Kingdom). Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The significance of difference between groups was determined using Student's paired or unpaired t tests where appropriate. Alternatively for multiple comparisons, the data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A probability of p ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Chemicals—Stock solutions of forskolin (50 mm) were made up in 100% ethanol. Unless otherwise stated, all of the chemicals were from Sigma. External HCO–3 Inhibits Human CFTR Currents—Results presented in Fig. 1 demonstrate that extracellularHCO3− inhibits human CFTR expressed in CHO or BHK cells in a manner similar to that observed for CFTR in native guinea pig pancreatic duct cells (26O'Reilly C.M. Winpenny J.P. Argent B.E. Gray M.A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The data shows dose-response curves for the inhibitory effect of externalHCO3− on human CFTR currents expressed in CHO cells (open circles) and for guinea pig CFTR (closed circles). The data are expressed as the percent inhibition of the inward current measured at Erev –60 mV using fWCR, and the curves have been fit to a simple one-site Michaelis-Menten equation. Overall, there is no significant difference in the maximal inhibition achieved between species (human, 70 ± 10.3%; guinea pig, 65 ± 4.0%); however, human CFTR had a significantly higher Km value (human, 37.4 ± 14; guinea pig, 5.2 ± 1.4 mm), suggesting that human CFTR is less sensitive to block by externalHCO3−. CFTR expressed in BHK cells (Fig. 1, closed triangle) behaved in a similar fashion to CFTR expressed in CHO cells. In all of the cases, the block by externalHCO3− was voltage-independent over the potential range ±100 mV and fully reversible (data not shown), similar to our previous results from guinea pig duct cells (26O'Reilly C.M.

Effect of Other External Anions on CFTR Currents in CHO Cells—Trans-inhibition of CFTR currents was also observed with Br–, aspartate–, and NO–3 (Table I). The efficacy sequence wasHCO3− = Br– = aspartate– > NO–3 (Table I). The extent of trans-inhibition caused by these anions was not obviously related to their relative permeabilities (Table I) as calculated from reversal potential shifts. For instance, Br– is more permeant through CFTR thanHCO3− (Px–/PCl– = 1.53) yet has an equivalent inhibitory effect on inward currents.Table IEffect of external anion substitution on inward CFTR current and relative anion selectivityAnionΔErevPx-/PCl-% InhibitionnHCO3−9.94 ± 1.500.57 ± 0.0750.2 ± 5.118Br--7.04 ± 1.501.53 ± 0.1048.3 ± 9.69Asp-16.80 ± 0.930.25 ± 0.0341.6 ± 7.010NO3−-5.40 ± 0.501.37 ± 0.0424.8 ± 8.67 Open table in a new tab External Cl–Concentration Underlies the Inhibition of CFTR in CHO Cells—All of the anions tested caused some inhibition of the inward CFTR Cl– current (Table I), suggesting that trans-inhibition of CFTR was not anion-specific. To investigate this further,CIo− was reduced without replacing the ionic component and osmolarity maintained at 300 mosm by the addition of mannitol. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, using fWCR both the outward and inward CFTR currents were inhibited by the replacement of 100 mmCIo− with mannitol. In this representative experiment, the inward CFTR Cl– current was reduced by 57.9% at Erev –60 mV in the presence of 51.5 mmCIo− compared with the current magnitude in the presence of 155.5 mmCIo−. Note that the degree of CFTR inhibition is very similar regardless of whether extracellular Cl– is replaced with mannitol or withHCO3− (compare Figs. 1 and 2A). Fig. 2B shows I/V plots for the experiment illustrated in Fig. 2A. In these experiments, the average change in Erev following replacement of 100 mm extracellular Cl– with mannitol was 12.8 ± 0.8 mV (n = 6), somewhat less than the predicted value (27.8 mV), which is probably explained by the presence of a cation conductance in the CHO cells (see legend to Table I). Fig. 2C shows the Cl– dose-inhibition curve for inward CFTR currents measured using fast WCR when extracellular NaCl is replaced with mannitol. Note that the plot is curvilinear and appears biphasic. The degree of current inhibition increased markedly to ∼50% asCIo− was reduced from 155 to 71.5 mm, but further reduction inCIo− to 10.5 mm caused rather less inhibition (Fig. 2C). Note that a substantial fraction (∼30%) of the CFTR current could not be inhibited, even whenCIo− was reduced to 10.5 mm. Internal Cl–Concentration Does Not Modulate CFTR in CHO Cells—We next used fWCR to investigate whether a reduction in internal [Cl–] also regulated CFTR. The intracellular [Cl–] in epithelial cells is usually in the 30–60 mm range (29Ishiguro H. Steward M.C. Sohma Y. Kubota T. Kitagawa M. Kondo T. Case R.M. Hayakawa T. Naruse S. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 617-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Foskett J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C998-C1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that we could not detect any significant change in forskolin-stimulated CFTR current density when pipette [Cl–] was either raised above or decreased below the standard value of 114 mm. Thus changes in internal [Cl–] down to 54 mm has no effect on Cl– influx (outward current), in marked contrast to the effect of lowering external [Cl–] by this amount on Cl– efflux (inward current). Lowering cytosolic [Cl–] also had no marked effect on inward current. In the presence of 54, 79, 114, and 154 mm internal Cl–, the mean current densities measured at Erev –60 mV were: –202.1 ± 76.5 (n = 5); –269.9 ± 95.4 (n = 3); –180.33 ± 30.8 (n = 10); and –275.0 ± 99 (n = 8) pA/pF, respectively (p = 0.97, Fig. 3A). Because the Km of CFTR for internal Cl– is ∼38 mm (31Tabcharani J.A. Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), one might expect some reduction in inward CFTR conductance at the lowest internal [Cl–] used in our experiments. The reason why we do not see a change is unclear, but we do not think it is because cytosolic Cl– was not being fixed adequately in our experiments since the zero current Erev measurement for the 54 mm internal Cl– data set (–11.7 ± 2.2 mV) is significantly different to the experiments employing 79 (–4.27 ± 2.3 mV, p < 0.05), 114 (–1.24 ± 0.75 mV, p < 0.001), and 154 mm internal Cl– (–0.7 ± 0.5 mV, p < 0.001). Importantly, the degree of trans-inhibition of CFTR currents following reduction inCIo− was not affected by these changes in internal [Cl–] (Fig. 3B). The mean percent inhibition of the inward current in the presence of 54, 79, 114, and 154 mm internal Cl– following the replacement of 100 mm external [Cl–] with mannitol was 49.8 ± 9.8 (n = 3), 71.5 (n = 2), 63.2 ± 7.0 (n = 7), and 54.9 ± 9.2% (n = 8), respectively (p = 0.96). Taken together, these observations suggest that trans-inhibition of CFTR is mediated solely by the concentration of external Cl– and that neither the internal [Cl–] nor the [Cl–] gradient across the cell membrane are important factors. External Cl–Inhibits CFTR Activity in Cell-free Membrane Patches from BHK Cells—To gain insight into the mechanism of theCIo− effect, we performed similar experiments using cell-free outside out membrane patches. Because of the density of channels in the transfected cells, only multi-CFTR-containing patches were obtained; therefore, kinetic analysis was limited to a comparison of the channel activity (NPo) before and after changes in external Cl– concentration. Nonetheless, Fig. 4A shows that a reduction inCIo− from 155.5 to 35.5 mm led to a marked decrease in the probability of channel opening without any obvious change in the size of the single channel currents. In three experiments, NPo decreased by 82.9 ± 12% and Student's paired t tests showed a highly significant change in this parameter (Fig. 4B, p = 0.012). The reverse experiment was also conducted in which the bath solution was changed from the lower to higher Cl– concentration, and results are summarized in Fig. 4C. From four such experiments, there was a significant change in NPo (p = 0.013) and an overall 62.3 ± 11.1% increase in channel activity, a value not significantly different to that obtained for the high to lowCIo− experiments. Therefore, these results suggest that the marked inhibition in whole cell inward current upon bath anion-replacement depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 is primarily due to a reduction in open state probability of CFTR channels. Recording Configuration Affects the Regulation of CFTR by External Cl–in CHO Cells—All of the experiments described so far were performed under situations in which the cytosolic solution was controlled by the composition of the pipette solution. The question we next asked was whether CFTR inhibition by changes inCIo− also occurred under more physiological conditions where the cytoplasmic compartment remains intact. To address this possibility, we turned to the sWCR-perforated patch recording technique (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using this approach, CFTR current density following stimulation with 5 μm forskolin was approximately twice as large as that found for fWCR (sWCR, 440.6 ± 57.7 and –387.9 ± 46.4 pA/pF (n = 14); fWCR, 238.2 ± 39.3 and –186.3 ± 25.1 pA/pF (n = 19) at Erev +60 mV and Erev –60 mV, respectively (p < 0.01 at both voltages)), indicating that cytoplasmic integrity is important for full CFTR current activation. Fig. 5 shows the dose-inhibition curve forCIo− obtained using sWCR (closed triangles) withCIo− being replaced iso-osmotically with mannitol. For comparison, fWCR data (closed circles), previously shown in Fig. 2C, are also included. In contrast to the data obtained in fWCR, the dose-inhibition curve for sWCR clearly shows a different profile. In sWCR, the percent reduction of inward CFTR current following a decrease inCIo− was significantly less over the range 116.5–71.5 mm Cl–. Moreover, the concentration ofCIo− causing a 50% inhibition of the forskolin-stimulated CFTR current at Erev –60 mV in sWCR was 31.8 mm compared with a value of 77.5 mm in fWCR, giving a leftward shift of the dose-inhibition curve of ∼47 mm. Nevertheless, the maximum degree of CFTR current inhibition was similar in fast and slow WCR (Fig. 5). The same difference in the Cl– dose-inhibition curves for fast and slow WCR was observed when extracellular Cl– was replaced withHCO3−. In sWCR, the response curve was shifted to the left by ∼39 mm (data not shown). Internal Ca2+Concentration Modulates Trans-inhibition in CHO Cells—The pipette solutions used for the fWCR experiments contained 5 mm EGTA, which will buffer the intracellular free [Ca2+] at ∼10–9m. However, EGTA is unable to cross the amphotericin-permeabilized membrane during sWCR; thus the internal free [Ca2+] in these experiments is unknown but is expected to be within the physiological range. To determine whether internal free [Ca2+] was modulating the inhibitory response, cytosolic Ca2+ was fixed at a more physiological resting value of 10–7m during fWCR experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 5 (open circles) shows that increasing the intracellular [Ca2+] from 10–9 to 10–7m in fWCR changes the shape of the dose-inhibition response toCIo− depletion. When intracellular Ca2+ is raised, the inhibition curve moves to the left, closely resembling that obtained in sWCR (Fig. 5, triangles). In fWCR, with 10–7m Ca2+ in the pipette, the mean percent inhibition of the inward CFTR current at Erev –60 mV was 9.3 ± 7.7%, 23.5 ± 3.5%, and 30.7 ± 4.9% at 116.5, 91.5, and 71.5 mmCIo−, respectively (n = 3–7). Two of these values (116.5 and 71.5 m"

In this study, we demonstrate that IFNaR2, a subunit of the type I IFN receptor, is proteolytically cleaved in a regulated manner. Immunoblotting shows that multi-step cleavage occurs in response to phorbol ester (PMA) and IFN-α, generating both a transmembrane ‘stub’ and the intracellular domain (ICD), similar to Notch proteolysis. Isolated membrane fractions process IFNaR2 to release the ICD. A chimeric receptor construct is utilized to show that cleavage requires the presenilins and occurs in response to epidermal growth factor and protein kinase C-δ overexpression, as well as PMA and type I IFNs. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrates that a green fluorescent protein–ICD fusion localizes predominantly to the nucleus. A fusion between the ICD and the Gal4 DNA-binding domain represses transcription, in a histone deacetylase-dependent manner, of a Gal4 upstream activating sequence-regulated reporter, while overexpression of the ICD alone represses transcription of a reporter linked to an ISRE. Proteolytic cleavage events may facilitate receptor turnover or, more likely, function as a mechanism for signaling similar to that employed by Notch and the Alzheimer's precursor protein."

In vertebrates, more than one hundred 2′-O-methyl groups have been identified in rRNA, most of which occur at highly conserved locations within functionally important regions (1Maden B.E. Prog.

In Archaea, homologs of box C/D snoRNPs (box C/D sRNPs) consist of box C/D sRNAs, fibrillarin, Nop5p (a single homolog of Nop56/58p), and L7Ae proteins (3Dennis P.P. Omer A. Lowe T. Mol.

The box C/D RNAs are responsible for the recognition of methylation target RNAs via base pairing of their antisense regions with the target. The s(no)RNP proteins contain the actual methyltransferase activity. The protein subunit that catalyzes the methyl transfer reactions in s(no)RNPs is believed to be fibrillarin. The first clue that linked the methylation activity of s(no)RNPs to fibrillarin came from the work of Tollervey et al. (9Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Jansen R. Kern H. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 443-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) on yeast, where the nop1.3 allele, a temperature-sensitive mutant of the nop1 gene coding for yeast fibrillarin, exhibited a strongly inhibited precursor rRNA methylation phenotype at non-permissive temperatures. The second evidence came from the crystal structure of an archaeal fibrillarin homolog from Methanococcus jannaschii (MJ), which revealed the conservation of the AdoMet-binding fold that is common to all known MTase structures (10Wang H. Boisvert D. Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We recently determined a co-crystal structure of fibrillarin complexed with Nop5p from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AF), which contained a bound AdoMet at the predicted binding site in fibrillarin (11Aittaleb M. Rashid R. Chen Q. Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. Li H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This result establishes further the role of fibrillarin as the methyltransferase.Similar to the previously known AdoMet-dependent MTases, fibrillarin contains the same set of conserved motifs that are important to the binding of AdoMet (see Fig. 1). These include motifs I-IV at the carboxyl ends of beta strands β1–β4 as defined by Cheng and Roberts (12Cheng X. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) in studying DNA MTases. Consistent with their important functional roles in catalysis, three temperature-sensitive mutants of yeast fibrillarin occurred within the conserved AdoMet-binding motifs. For instance, nop1.2, nop1.3, and nop1.7 mutations occurred in motif III, motif I, and motifs II and IV, respectively (9Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Jansen R. Kern H. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 443-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by using an in vitro reconstituted archaeal sRNP enzyme, Omer et al. (13Omer A.D. Ziesche S. Ebhardt H. Dennis P.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5289-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) demonstrated that substitutions of two amino acids within motifs I and III of Sulfolobus solfataricus fibrillarin (A85V and P129V) resulted in completely or partially abolished methylation activities, whereas sRNP assembly was unaffected. These data suggest that fibrillarin has a function similar to other previously known AdoMet-dependent MTases.However, recent structural and biochemical evidence suggests that fibrillarin alone binds weakly to AdoMet. There are currently three known fibrillarin crystal structures, all from Archaea, MJ (10Wang H. Boisvert D. Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), AF (11Aittaleb M. Rashid R. Chen Q. Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. Li H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and Puroccocus furiosus (PF) (14Deng L. Starostina N.G. Liu Z.J. Rose J.P. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Wang B.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Among these three structures, only that in complex with AF Nop5p had the cofactor bound at the predicted AdoMet-binding site. Interestingly, in both structures of fibrillarin without the bound Nop5p (MJ and PF), motif I and the loop connecting β1 and α1 of fibrillarin adopted conformations that would exclude the binding of AdoMet (10Wang H. Boisvert D. Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 14Deng L. Starostina N.G. Liu Z.J. Rose J.P. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Wang B.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This clearly raised the possibility that Nop5p has a functional role in cofactor binding by modulating the conformation of AdoMet-binding motifs in fibrillarin. However it is also possible that the binding of the cofactor itself induces the conformational change of the cofactor binding pocket in fibrillarin.In the co-crystal structure of AF fibrillarin-Nop5p complex bound with AdoMet (holocomplex), a number of conserved fibrillarin residues were observed to interact directly with AdoMet (Fig. 1). Glu-88 forms two hydrogen bonds with the ribose hydroxyl groups of AdoMet. Thr-70 also forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxyl group of AdoMet. Asp-133 is situated near the positively charged thiomethyl group and thus may facilitate cofactor binding through favorable electrostatic interactions. Finally, Tyr-89 establishes an aromatic stacking interaction with the adenine ring of the cofactor. The opposing side of the phenol ring of Tyr-89 closely packs against a positive Nop5p residue, Arg-169. This structural arrangement between Tyr-89 of fibrillarin and Arg-169 of Nop5p creates a strong cation-π interaction as evident from the large negative electrostatic and van der Waals energies between them (Ees = –5.2 kcal/mol, Evdw =–2.8 kcal/mol) (computed by CAPTURE) (15Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Notably, Tyr-89 would be completely exposed to solvent without forming the cation-π interaction. Tyr-89 is well conserved among all known fibrillarin proteins. Arg-169 is also conserved among the Nop family of proteins, suggesting that this cation-π interaction is preserved in all homologous complexes of fibrillarin and Nop5p. The importance of this cation-π bridge formed between fibrillarin and Nop5p may play a critical role in stabilizing the association of the cofactor with fibrillarin.In this work, we examined the requirement of Nop5p for cofactor binding by combining structural, thermodynamic, and functional analyses. To discern the effect on fibrillarin conformational changes in the cofactor binding pocket, we refined the crystal structure of Nop5p-fibrillarin complex without soaked cofactors at 3.5 Å. We also established isothermal titration calorimetry conditions, which allowed us to directly compare thermodynamic parameters of AdoMet binding to different fibrillarin complexes. By monitoring the changes in heat as the cofactor was titrated into a protein solution, we obtained binding constants and enthalpy changes of AdoMet binding to the Nop5p-fibrillarin complex, to mutant fibrillarin Nop5p complexes, and to fibrillarin. Furthermore, to assess the functional importance of the cofactor interacting residues in both fibrillarin and Nop5p, we compared in vitro methylation activities of the wild-type Nop5p-fibrillarin complex and its mutants where several AdoMet-binding residues were disrupted. These structural, thermodynamic, and functional studies support the stabilizing role of Nop5p in cofactor binding to fibrillarin and clearly identify residues in fibrillarin that are directly involved in cofactor binding and catalysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Purification—The wild-type Nop5p-fibrillarin protein complex and fibrillarin alone were purified as described previously by Aittaleb et al. (11Aittaleb M. Rashid R. Chen Q. Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. Li H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All the mutations were performed within co-expressing fibrillarin and Nop5p genes using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The mutants were purified in a similar procedure as that for the wild type. All proteins were subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex S200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 1.0 m NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Gel filtration profiles for all mutant fibrillairin-Nop5p complexes were similar to that of the wild-type complex, suggesting no misfolding of the mutant proteins.Structure Refinement—During earlier structure determination of the fibrillarin-Nop5p complex, we collected a multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction data set from a crystal of fibrillarin-Nop5p complex containing seleno-methionine without soaked cofactors. This data set allowed phase determination. The final structure, however, was refined against the diffraction data set collected from cofactor-soaked fibrillarin-Nop5p crystal because of its higher resolution. To elucidate the structural conformation around the cofactor binding site in the absence of a bound cofactor, we have now refined the coordinates of fibrillarin-Nop5p complex against the data set collected at the selenine K-edge. This data set has the best statistics among the three data sets (11Aittaleb M. Rashid R. Chen Q. Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. Li H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out using crystallography NMR software (CNS) (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

The titration calorimeter consists of 1.45 ml of sample cell containing a macromolecule solution and a matched thermal reference cell filled with water. AdoMet or S-adenosyl-l-homocystein (AdoHcy) was dissolved in the same buffer used for the protein to be titrated. Prior to the experiment, samples were filtered and degassed under vacuum for 10 min in a Thermo Vac system (Microcal). The sample cell was filled with the working buffer (for dilution heat control) or with the protein to be characterized. Titrations with the cofactor (25× protein concentration) consisted of a preliminary 2-μl injection (not to be considered in data analysis) followed by twenty-nine 5 μl injections with at least 4-min intervals between injections. All runs were made at constant stirrer speed of 310 rpm, and all experiments were performed at 30 °C. The heat caused by the dilution of the cofactor was subtracted from the experimental data conducted with the protein. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorption using the theoretical extinction coefficients computed from the amino acid sequences (ϵ280 = 48360 m–1 cm–1). The evolved heat peaks were integrated and then fitted to a theoretical titration curve of a single binding site model by non-linear least squares to yield ΔH0 (molar enthalpy change in kcal/mol), Ka (binding constant in molar–1) and n (stoichiometry ratio).All isotherms show negative deflection indicative of an exothermic reaction (see Fig. 3, A and B). A separate run with cofactor titrating into buffer showed insignificant endothermic and equal sized dilution peaks, suggesting that at this concentration no aggregation of the cofactor in buffer occurs (Fig. 3B). Despite the fact that Nop5p-fibrillarin complex forms a homodimer as previously observed in crystal and in solution (11Aittaleb M. Rashid R. Chen Q. Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. Li H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 18Rashid R. Aittaleb M. Chen Q. Spiegel K. Demeler B. Li H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), ITC data clearly exhibited the characteristics of single set of identical sites. Therefore, all data were processed using the standard One Set of One Site model as implemented in the Microcal Origin software based on the Wiseman isotherm (17Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar),Q=nMtΔH0V02[1+XtnMt+1nKaMt−(1+XtnMt+1nKaMt)2−4XtnMt]eq.1 where Q is the heat content of the solution, Ka is the binding constant, and Mt is the bulk concentration of the protein in volume V0, Xt is the bulk concentration of the ligand, and n is the number of binding sites. During actual fitting, the heat released for each injection increment was used with the correction of displaced volume caused by each injection. Therefore, the enthalpy change (ΔH0) and the binding constant (Ka) were directly obtainable from the experiments after data processing. The free energy and entropy were subsequently calculated using ΔG0 = –RTlnKa and TΔS0 = –ΔG0+ΔH0, respectively. The resulting binding parameters (binding constant Ka, molar Gibbs free energy, ΔG0, molar enthalpy ΔH0, and molar entropy ΔS0) of the proteins with AdoMet and with AdoHcy (D133A mutant only), and the standard deviations are summarized in Table II.Fig. 3Example ITC profiles. In both A and B profiles, the upper panels indicate the baseline-subtracted raw titration data obtained for injections of the cofactor into the protein solution, and the lower panels indicate the integrated areas for the peaks normalized to the cofactor/protein molar ratio. Dark dots showing the experimental data and solid lines showing the best fit to one set of the binding sites model were obtained by nonlinear least squares fitting.

Fenley M.O. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 935-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates of the wild-type Nop5p-fibrillarin complex (Protein Data Bank accession number 1NT2) were employed, and no missing residues or hydrogen atoms were added. For the D133A mutant Nop5p-fibrillarin complex, the Asp-133 residue was substituted for alanine followed by stereochemistry regularization using the O program (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). The dielectric constant of the solute was set to 2 and the solvent to 80. The temperature and ionic strength of the solution was fixed at 298 Kelvin and 0.1 m NaCl, respectively. The Parse parameter set (21Sitkoff D. Sharp K.A. Honig B. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 1978-1988Crossref Scopus (1838) Google Scholar) was used to assign van der Waals radii to atoms. The formal charge set was employed with a charge of –1e assigned to aspartate, glutamate, and the C-terminal residues. A charge of +1e was assigned to lysine and arginine residues. Histidine residues were assigned a charge of +0.5e. The net charge of the wild-type and mutant Nop5p-fibrillarin complexes is +6.5e and +7.5e, respectively. The solvent-excluded molecular surface was employed to define the solute-solvent boundary based on a 1.4-Å solvent probe radius. No ion exclusion region was considered.The MSMS molecular surface program (22Sanner M.F. Olson A.J. Spehner J.C. Biopolymers. 1996; 38: 305-320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was employed to triangulate the solvent-excluded surface and thus generate the boundary elements (∼90,000 triangles) used in the linear PB solution. The finite difference cubic grid contained 1283 nodes. The total extent of the three-dimensional uniform Cartesian grid is four times the largest dimension of the solute. Computed electrostatic potential surfaces for both the wild-type and the D133A mutant are displayed in Fig. 4.Fig. 4Computed surface electrostatic potentials of the wild-type (left) and the D133A mutant (right) Nop5p-fibrillarin complexes at the AdoMet-binding pocket suggest electrostatic stabilization of cofactor binding by Asp133. The bound cofactor, AdoMet, is shown in stick models. The electrostatic potential was obtained by solving the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The solvent-excluded surface with a solvent probe radius of 1.4 Å was used to define the solute-solvent boundary. The electrostatic potential ranges from yellow to red to white to blue to green, where yellow and red are negative potential, white is neutral, and blue and green are positive potential. The electrostatic potential range is –5 kcal/mol/e (yellow) to +5 kcal/mol/e (green).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In Vitro Methylation Assay—In vitro methylation assays were carried out according to a published procedure described previously (18Rashid R. Aittaleb M. Chen Q. Spiegel K. Demeler B. Li H. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, all enzymes were prepared to be free of ribonuclease contamination before being assembled for catalysis. Tritium-AdoMet (Sigma) was used as the methyl donor in the reaction, which permitted us to monitor the methylation reaction by counting the retained radioactivity caused by the target RNA on DE81 ion exchange filter. Wild-type Nop5p-fibrillarin or a mutant was mixed with L7Ae protein prior to being added to a pre-annealed RNA mixture containing both the AF sR3 box C/D guide RNA (rna.wustl.edu/snoRNAdb/) and a complementary target RNA oligo to the guide sequence upstream of box D sequences. The radioactivity retained on the DE81 filter at each reaction time point was quantified by scintillation counter. The production of methylation product was plotted in Fig. 5 along with least-square fitted progress curves.Fig. 5Methylation progression curves obtained from in vitro methylation assay on wild-type and mutant Nop5p-fibrillarin complexes. Each reaction mixtures contained Nop5p-fibrillarin or a mutant complex, L7Ae protein, box C/D guide RNA, target RNA oligo complementary to box C/D, and H3-labeled AdoMet cofactor. The incorporation of the methyl group was monitored by counting the retained radioactivity on extensively washed DE81 ion exchange filters at different intervals of time. The experimentally measured activities were normalized to be zero at t = 0 min and were fitted to a typical progress curve.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RESULTSStructural Comparison of AdoMet-binding Sites in Nop5p-free and Nop5p-bound Fibrillarins—The fibrillarin portion of the AF Nop5p-fibrillarin complex structure (11Aittaleb M. Rashid R. Chen Q. Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. Li H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was superimposed with those of MJ fibrillarin (10Wang H. Boisvert D. Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and of PF fibrillarin (14Deng L. Starostina N.G. Liu Z.J. Rose J.P. Terns R.M. Terns M.P. Wang B.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 726-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The backbone root mean square differences were 1.095 Å (191 Cα atoms) for MJ fibrillarin and 0.934 Å (144 Cα atoms) for PH fibrillarin. The most significant difference within the core structure of the three fibrillarins is in motif I and II where the cofactor binds (Fig. 2, B and C). In particular, the backbone geometry of motif II loop in the two free fibrillarin structures differ from each other and from the fibrillarin bound with Nop5p and AdoMet. Each free fibrillarin adopted a conformation that would exclude the binding of the cofactor. In both structures, the loops connecting β2 and α2 traversed through where the ribose moiety of AdoMet would lie. Most dramatically, the aromatic residues (Phe-106 in PF fibrillarin and Tyr-106 in MJ fibrillarin) completely swung away from where they could establish the favorable base stacking interactions with the cofactor adenine ring and protruded into the solvent region (Fig. 2, B and C). This striking difference in backbone geometry and key binding residues between the two free fibrillarin structures and that bound with cofactor suggested an intrinsic structural flexibility of this region in fibrillarin that could potentially hinder the optimal binding of the cofactor.The Apocomplex Structure of Nop5p-Fibrillarin Closely Resembles the Holocomplex—To discern whether the observed conformational differences between free fibrillarin structures and that bound with cofactor and Nop5p are induced by Nop5p binding or by cofactor binding, we refined the crystal structure of Nop5p-fibrillarin in the absence of soaked AdoMet (apocomplex). The refined apocomplex of Nop5p-fibrillarin was superimposed with the holocomplex reported previously (11Aittaleb M. Rashid R. Chen Q. Palmer J.R. Daniels C.J. Li H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). SigmaA-weighted 3Fo – 2Fc and Fo – Fc maps were computed by using the observed amplitude and phases resulted from refined coordinates. Both maps clearly showed an absence of a bound cofactor at the predicted AdoMet binding site (Fig. 2A). Fig. 2A also showed that the fibrillarin residues covering the AdoMet binding site overl"

These include a DNA polymerase and its accessory factor, a helicase/primase, and a single strand binding protein. The EBV polymerase accessory factor has been identified as the product of the BMRF1 gene and has been shown by functional assays to increase the activity and processivity of the polymerase. Unlike other members of this class of factors, BMRF1 is also a transcription factor regulating certain EBV genes. Although several polymerase accessory factors, including eukaryotic proliferating cell nuclear antigen, Escherichia coli β protein, and T4 gene 45 protein have been shown to form oligomeric rings termed sliding clamps, nothing is known about the oligomeric state of BMRF1 or whether it forms a ring. In this work, BMRF1 was purified directly from human cells infected with an adenovirus vector expressing the BMRF1 gene product. The protein was purified to near homogeneity, and examination by negative staining electron microscopy revealed large, flat, ring-shaped molecules with a diameter of 15.5 ± 0.8 nm and a distinct 5.3-nm diameter hole in the center. The size of these rings is consistent with an oligomer of 6 monomers, nearly twice as large as the trimeric proliferating cell nuclear antigen ring. Unlike the herpes simplex virus UL42 homologue, BMRF1 was found to self-associate in solution. These findings extend the theme of polymerase accessory factors adopting ring-shaped structures and provide an example in which the ring is significantly larger than any previously described sliding clamp.

In the latent phase, the virus is maintained as an episome and replicates using the OriP origin of replication and cellular machinery (1Kieff E. Liebowitz D. Fields B. Knipe D.

Lytic infection uses a separate origin, OriLyt and several virally encoded proteins (5Gruffat H. Renner O. Pich D. Hammerschmidt W. J.

Cell. 1988; 55: 427-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Rolling circle replication would utilize the EBV gene products BALF1 (catalytic component of viral DNA polymerase), BMRF1 (the polymerase accessory protein), BALF2 (single strand binding protein), BSLF1 (primase), BBLF4 (helicase), and BBLF2/3 (helicase/primase-associated protein) (8Fixman E.D. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5030-5039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fixman E.D. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2998-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligase and RNase H functions would also be required. The BMRF1 polymerase accessory factor exists in two phosphorylated forms of 50 and 52 kDa, while a third unphosphorylated 48-kDa form is seen in baculovirus-infected cells (10Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BMRF1 co-purifies with the 110-kDa EBV DNA polymerase, and they appear to function together as a holoenzyme (11Kallin B. Sternas L.

Polymerase activity is stimulated by more than 10-fold when BMRF1 is included in reactions containing the catalytic subunit and an activated DNA template (14Tsurumi T. Daikoku T. Kurachi R. Nishiyama Y. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 7648-7653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, BMRF1 appears to increase the processivity of the viral polymerase, suggesting a model in which the accessory protein acts as a sliding clamp that prevents dissociation of the polymerase from the active template. The herpes simplex virus type 1 UL42 polymerase accessory protein does not share extensive amino acid homology with BMRF1, but in both proteins the aminoterminal two-thirds of the molecule contains a DNA-binding domain and a region of interaction with the catalytic subunit (15Kiehl A. Dorsky D.I. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both BMRF1 and UL42 bind to double strand DNA with high affinity in contrast to the well characterized sliding clamps Escherichia coli β, T4 gene 45 protein, and PCNA, which lack an intrinsic DNA-binding activity (16Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 17Krishna T.S. Fenyo D. Kong X.P. Gary S. Chait B.T. Burgers P. Kuriyan J. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 296: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A unique feature of BMRF1 is that it also serves as a transcriptional activator, a function that to date has not been found with other polymerase accessory proteins (19Zhang Q. Holley-Guthrie E. Ge J.Q. Dorsky D. Kenney S. Virology. 1997; 230: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation may function to induce viral proteins that are required for lytic replication. E. coli β, T4 gene 45 protein, and PCNA have been shown to form oligomeric rings that can translocate along DNA without direct contacts that could inhibit polymerase movement (16Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 17Krishna T.S. Fenyo D. Kong X.P. Gary S. Chait B.T. Burgers P. Kuriyan J. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 296: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Despite the high affinity for DNA, BMRF1 does not appear to retard the holoenzyme, and this has also been observed with UL42 (20Randell J.C. Coen D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PCNA and T4 gene 45 proteins form homotrimers, whereas E. coli β is a homodimer (21Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and the checkpoint sliding clamp Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 is a heterotrimeric ring (22Griffith J.D. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15233-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Each of these sliding clamps has a homologous ATP-dependent clamp loading factor that actively places the clamp around DNA. Clamp loaders have not been identified for BMRF1 or UL42. In this study, we used electron microscopy (EM) to examine the structural organization of BMRF1 in solution. We find it exists as a ring-shaped structure with a distinct hole in the center. The size of the rings is suggestive of an oligomer of 6 monomers. Cells and Adenovirus Vectors—A replication-deficient adenovirus vector (E1/E3 deleted) expressing the BMRF1 protein (AdBMRF1) controlled by the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter was made using the Cre-lox-mediated recombination systems as described previously (23Westphal E.M. Mauser A. Swenson J. Davis M.G. Talarico C.L. Kenney S.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1485-1491PubMed Google Scholar). The control vector contained the bacterial β-galactosidase gene (AdLacZ) instead of the BMRF1 gene. HeLa cells were infected with the adenovirus vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 10. Plasmid Vectors—A vector expressing full-length BMRF1 protein linked at its amino terminus in-frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST) was a gift from David Dorsky (University of Connecticut Health Center). A plasmid containing the BMRF1 gene inserted into the SG5 vector (Stratagene) was used for in vitro translation studies and was a gift from David Dorsky. Protein Purification of BMRF1 Expressed in Cells—Adenovirus-infected HeLa cells (10 × 150-mm plates) were harvested 48 h after infection. Cells were washed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (5 ml/plate) and then scraped into 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline/plate and pelleted by low speed centrifugation (1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by one freeze-thaw cycle and sonication (three 15-s pulses, 50% duty cycle). Lysates were clarified by high speed centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. Using a fast protein liquid chromatography system, samples were applied to a 10-ml heparin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column pre-equilibrated with Buffer H (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 mm KCl at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of Buffer H plus 100 mm KCl and eluted with a 30-ml gradient of 100–800 mm KCl in Buffer H. Peak fractions were dialyzed against 4 liters of Buffer H plus 100 mm KCl and then loaded on a 10-ml DNA-cellulose column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with Buffer H plus 100 mm KCl at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. The column was washed with Buffer H plus 100 mm KCl, and proteins were eluted with a 30-ml gradient of 100–800 mm KCl in Buffer H. Peak fractions were dialyzed against Buffer H containing 100 mm KCl and 20% glycerol prior to storage. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assays. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated on 10% discontinuous SDS-PAGE followed by immobilization on nitrocellulose membranes using an electrotransfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in 1× TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of a mouse monoclonal antibody to BMRF1 (Capricorn, Inc.) in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. Blots were washed three times (10 min/wash) in 1× TBS-T, incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with 1× TBS-T, and detected by chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). BMRF1 Dimerization Assays—35S-Labeled in vitro translated BMRF1 protein was produced from the SG5-BMRF1 vector using the TnT-T7 quick-coupled in vitro translation system (Promega). GST or GST-BMRF1 proteins coupled to 50 μl of glutathione beads (50% slurry) (Sigma) were incubated with 3 μl of the 35S-labeled in vitro translated BMRF1 protein in 500-μl reactions containing binding buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times in binding buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Electron Microscopy—For negative staining, the protein was diluted to a concentration of 30–50 μg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2, adsorbed to a thin carbon foil according to the method of Valentine and Green (24Valentine R.C. Green N.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 27: 615-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Transmission electron microscopy was performed using a Philips CM12 electron microscope. The micrographs were recorded at a ×60,000 magnification and scanned using a Nikon LS4500 film scanner. Morphometric measurements were made using Gatan Digital Image software. Images were arranged into panels using Adobe Photo-Shop software. Purification of BMRF1 from Cells—Previous studies with purified BMRF1 have utilized either baculovirus vectors or in vitro transcription and translation systems to express the protein. One of the concerns with these systems is whether all of the post-translational modifications placed on the protein in infected human cells have been added. For example, BMRF1 purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells is a mixture of two phosphorylated and one unphosphorylated form (10Tsurumi T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that the BMRF1 protein used for these studies was as close as possible to its cellular state, we used an adenovirus-based vector system to express BMRF1 in HeLa cells. These have been used to demonstrate that, in vivo, BMRF1 can enhance the gastrin gene expression. 2Holley-Guthrie, E. A., Seaman, W. T., Bhende, P., Merchant, J. L., and Kenney, S. C. (2004) J. Virol., in press. As a control, a vector containing the bacterial LacZ gene was used. Lysates from HeLa cells infected with the AdBMRF1 or AdLacZ were prepared 48 h after infection. The expressed proteins were first passed over a heparin-Sepharose column, and bound proteins were eluted using a salt gradient. A single peak was observed by A320 nm measurement, and fractions within this peak were found to contain BMRF1 by Western blot analysis. Appropriate fractions were pooled, dialyzed to decrease the salt concentration, and then applied to a DNA-cellulose column. Proteins were eluted using a salt gradient, and peak fractions were tested by Western blot analysis for the presence of BMRF1 (see under “Materials and Methods”). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis from pooled fractions of both columns are shown in Fig. 1. As seen in Fig. 1A, pooled fractions from the heparin-Sepharose and DNA-cellulose columns showed a strong band around 50 kDa in Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Western blots analysis revealed two bands in both column pools that presumably represent the 50- and 52-kDa proteins (Fig. 1B). The BMRF1 band in the heparin-Sepharose fractions was by far the most dominant species, representing ∼60% of the total protein, with the remaining 40% spread over a wide range of molecular weights. The DNA-cellulose pool was near homogeneity as determined by Coomassie Blue staining. Parallel purification using lysates from AdLacZ-infected cells showed negligible amounts of contaminating protein after the DNA-cellulose column (Fig. 1). BMRF1 Interacts with Itself—Although the herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA polymerase processivity factor UL42 does not form a dimer (20Randell J.C. Coen D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus DNA polymerase processivity factor was recently shown to dimerize (25Chen X. Lin K. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28375-28386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), particularly when bound to DNA. To determine whether BMRF1 can interact with itself, 35S-labeled in vitro translated BMRF1 protein was incubated with either GST protein or a GST-BMRF1 conjugated to glutathione-linked beads, and proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2, in vitro translated BMRF1 did not interact with the GST protein alone but clearly interacted with the GST-BMRF1 fusion protein. Thus, BMRF1 can dimerize and/or form higher order structures with itself in solution. Visualization of BMRF1 Rings—To directly examine the oligomeric state of BMRF1, unfixed protein in a buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2 was prepared for EM by negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate (see under “Materials and Methods”). Examination of BMRF1 purified through the DNA-cellulose column step to homogeneity revealed molecules with a distinct ring-shaped structure, but the relatively low protein concentration resulted in the rings being scattered at a distance in the fields. Efforts to concentrate the sample led to a loss of the protein. However, when BMRF1 purified only through the heparin-Sepharose step (which was at a higher protein concentration) was examined, fields with the same rings much more closely spaced were observed (Fig. 3A). Although the heparin-Sepharose pool was contaminated with other proteins, BMRF1 was the predominant protein detected by Coomassie Blue staining, and the protein concentrations were high enough for negative staining. The BMRF1 particles seen in the heparin-Sepharose pool matched the size and shapes observed in the highly pure DNA-cellulose peak, and thus we concluded that these rings are indeed formed by BMRF1. There was no evidence as seen by EM from either protein pool for a significant concentration of protein particles of sizes that would correspond to BMRF1 dimers, compact trimers, or tetramers. Closer examination of the rings showed that the majority had a very distinct appearance (Fig. 3B). Analysis of their dimensions revealed a diameter of 15.5 ± 0.8 nm (n = 12), with a 5.3 ± 0.8 nm (n = 10) hole in the center. Some particles appeared deformed possibly because of the staining procedure or interaction with the carbon foil. The only projection of the BMRF1 ring observed was that of a flat disk with a large hole, suggesting that the rings are too thin to be stable lying edgewise on the EM support. Simple modeling of these structures suggests that the most probable oligomeric state is that of a ring with six subunits. The BMRF1 ring appears as a flat toroid constructed of a 5-nm-wide protein tube that forms a smooth contoured ring 15.5 ± 0.8 nm wide with a 5.3 ± 0.8-nm hole in the center. The molecular weight of streptavidin is close to that of a BMRF1 monomer, and its diameter is 5.6 ± 1.3 nm. Modeling indicates that six such protein balls could easily be arranged side by side to generate the rings observed here. Other arrangements and oligomeric states, however, are possible depending on the shape of the BMRF1 monomer. Unfortunately, efforts at simple rotational analysis were not successful, and more complex single particle reconstruction will be required in the future to resolve individual monomers in the rings and obtain a higher resolution structure. The Classic Sliding Clamps—E. coli β, T4 gene 45 protein, and eukaryotic PCNA all share a nearly exact “Christmas wreath”-shaped ring structure (16Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 17Krishna T.S. Fenyo D. Kong X.P. Gary S. Chait B.T. Burgers P. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18Moarefi I. Jeruzalmi D. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in spite of being formed from two (E. coli β) or three (PCNA and T4 gene 45 protein) subunits. Furthermore, the checkpoint clamp Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 is a heterotrimer with a shape similar to the latter proteins consisting of an 8.5-nm-diameter ring with a 3.5-nm hole (22Griffith J.D. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15233-15236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). All of these rings have molecular masses of approximately 100 kDa. It is not clear what the significance of a larger ring would be and how this may be related to its association with the EBV DNA polymerase and other proteins. Additionally, it is not known how BMRF1 or UL42 is assembled around DNA in the apparent absence of ATP-dependent clamp loading factors such as those utilized by the classic sliding clamps. Possibly the nonspecific affinity of BMRF1 and UL42 for duplex DNA allows them to self-assemble around DNA. Future studies of both proteins assembled onto DNA may aid in answering such questions. The multisubunit structures observed by EM are consistent with the data demonstrating that BMRF1 can associate with itself in solution. In contrast, UL42 does not form dimers or other higher order oligomers in solution (20Randell J.C. Coen D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The polymerase processivity factor of another γ-herpesvirus, Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus, has been shown to self-associate, and oligomerization appears to be required for enhanced polymerase processivity and DNA binding (25Chen X. Lin K. Ricciardi R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28375-28386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this latter study, however, cross-linking reagents were required to observe oligomerization. BMRF1 is unique among the polymerase processivity factors in performing a second function as a transcriptional activator. BMRF1 activates one of the two EBV OriLyt promoters (the early viral BHLF1 promoter) as well as the cellular gastrin promoter2 (19Zhang Q. Holley-Guthrie E. Ge J.Q. Dorsky D. Kenney S. Virology. 1997; 230: 22-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Zhang Q. Hong Y. Dorsky D. Holley-Guthrie E. Zalani S. Elshiekh N.A. Kiehl A. Le T. Kenney S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5131-5142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BMRF1-responsive regions of the BHLF1 and gastrin promoters contain binding sites for the cellular transcription factors SP1 and ZBP-89, although the precise mechanisms for the BMRF1 transcriptional effect have not yet been defined. Whether the ring-like structures observed in this study also mediate the transcriptional effects of BMRF1 remains unknown. It is possible that alternative conformations or structures of BMRF1 mediate its replication versus transcriptional effects. For example, BMRF1 is hyperphosphorylated by the virally encoded kinase BGLF4 (27Chen M.R. Chang S.J. Huang H. Chen J.Y. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Gershburg E. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 998-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in infected cells. Clearly, this hyperphosphorylation is not required for ring formation, but it may provide a mechanism that could regulate these structures presumably involved in its polymerase processivity function, as contrasted with possible alternative conformations that may be needed for the regulation of transcription."
