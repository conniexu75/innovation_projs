https://openalex.org/W2044825578,"Electron microscopic examination of the histone H1-depleted, folded genomes of Drosophila melanogaster reveals that they are composed of long cylindrical cables of about 100 Å diameter. Limited single-strand nicking with DNAase I relaxes the 100 Å fibers to a “beads-on-a-string” structure, showing the nucleosomes and internucleosome DNA. Based on these results and other available data, we have constructed a detailed space-filling model for the higher order DNA coiling in chromatin, starting with the symmetrical nucleosome core previously described ( Weintraub et al., 1976 Weintraub H. Worcel A. Alberts B. Cell. 1976; 9: 409-417 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar ). The model defines the path of the DNA helix and the nucleosome arrangement along the DNA coil for both the 100 Å and the 200–300 Å fibers. Following Sobell et al., 1976 Sobell H.M. Tsai C. Gilbert S.G. Jain S.C. Sakore T.D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 73. 1976: 3068-3072 Google Scholar , we believe that the DNA is coiled in the 100 Å nucleofilament in a uniform left-handed supercoil of about 90 base pairs (bp) per turn and 47 Å pitch; the 140 bp symmetrical nucleosome cores align themselves along this uniform DNA superhelix so that the isologous outer surfaces of adjacent nucleosomes touch and the internucleosome spacer DNA coils between them. A few single-strand discontinuities [about one nick per 85 kilobases (kb); Benyajati and Worcel, 1976 Benyajati C. Worcel A. Cell. 1976; 9: 393-407 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar ] in the H1-depleted 100 Å fiber can thus relax the negatively supercoiled internucleosome DNA generating the “beads-on -a-string” appearance. We propose that histone H1 binds to the 100 Å diameter superhelix and coils it into tightly packed, 110 Å pitch super-superhelices (“solenoids;” Finch and Klug, 1976 Finch J.T. Klug A. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 73. 1976: 1897-1901 Google Scholar ) of variable diameter (between 200–300 Å). In our model, the “thick” 200–300 Å fiber is stabilized at metaphase by histone H1-H1 heterologous interactions between adjacent helical turns of the nucleofilament, and the internucleosome spacer DNA is located on the outside. Symmetry considerations demand that changes in the length of the repeat should lead to variations in the number of nucleosomes per helical turn and in the handedness of these turns in the 200–300 Å metaphase fiber."

This afferent input is thought to provide the visual cues activating the visuomotor mechanisms of the parietal lobe for the direction of visual attention."
https://openalex.org/W1500508767,"Two molecular forms of prekallikrein can be isolated from pooled normal human plasma. Their approximate molecular weights by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis are 88,000 and 85,000. The two bands observed are shown to represent prekallikrein by functional, immunochemical, and structural criteria. Both forms are cleaved by activated Hageman factor, they appear to share antigenic determinants, they are not interconvertible upon incubation with activated Hageman factor or kallikrein, and the ratio of kinin-generating, and plasminogen-activating activities of the preparations are independent of the relative proportion of each band. Activated Factor XII converts prekallikrein to kallikrein by limited proteolysis and two disulfide-linked chains designated kallikrein heavy chain (Mr = 52,000) and kallikrein light chains (Mr = 36,000 or 33,000) are formed. The active site is associated with the light chains as assessed by incorporation of [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate. No dissociable fragments were observed in the absence of reducing agents. However, kallikrein could digest prekallikrein to diminish its molecular weight by 10,000. In addition, two factors capable of activating plasminogen to plasmin have been isolated; one is identified as kallikrein. The second principle fractionates with Factor XI and is demonstrable in normal and prekallikrein-deficient plasma."

https://openalex.org/W1523775189,"A lectin, whose specific activity in soluble extracts of embryonic chick pectoral muscle increases strikingly between 8 and 16 days of development, has been purified by affinity chromatography on derivatized Sepharose 4B coupled to p-aminophenyl-beta-D-lactoside. After affinity chromatography the lectin is pure except for minor contamination with another protein possibly representing a second muscle lectin. The latter can be completely removed by preparative isoelectric focusing. The purified lectin has an apparent molecular weight of 30,000 and an apparent subunit molecular weight of 15,000. Its isoelectric point is 4.0. The most potent saccharide inhibitors tested were thiodigalactoside and lactose. An antibody has been raised to the pure lectin. Studies with this antibody indicate that the lectin is present both on the surface of and within myoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2090262721,"The macronucleus of the protozoan, Tetrahymena, is known to contain multiple rRNA genes which are not linked to the chromosomes. Here we present evidence that the germinal micronucleus of this organism contains a single gene for rRNA integrated into the chromosomal DNA. Unlike the extrachromosomal copies of the macronucleus, which are composed of a pair of reversely repeated sequences (a palindrome), the integrated copy of rDNA is nonrepetitive or half the size of the extrachromosomal rDNA. Furthermore, we have failed to detect such an integrated copy of rDNA in the macronucleus. The implications of these observations for the amplification and evolution of rDNA are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2140433525,"Two classes of diphtheria toxin-resistant variants were selected from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells: permeability variants, in which uptake of toxin was impaired, and a new class of cytoplasmic variants, which were cross-resistant to Pseudomonas exotoxin. EF-2 prepared from the cytoplasmic variants was resistant to ADP-ribosylation by either toxin. The evidence presented suggests that these are translational variants possessing a mutationally altered EF-2 gene product. These studies also confirmed that Pseudomonas toxin ADP-ribosylates EF-2 in toxin-sensitive intact cells, as well as in cell-free systems."
https://openalex.org/W2025217468,"An endonuclease restriction fragment of Bacillus subtilis DNA has been identified that contains a gene whose transcription is activated early during the process of spore formation. This 4.4 kilobase (kb) DNA was detected by hybridizing electrophoretically separated Eco R1 restriction fragments with a radioactively labeled RNA of 0.4 kb from sporulating cells. The 4.4 kb B. subtilis DNA was then cloned and amplified in E. coli by insertion into the plasmid vector pMB9. Using the cloned B. subtilis DNA as a hybridization probe, we were able to detect the 0.4 kb transcript in total RNA from pulse-labeled bacteria. In wild-type cells, the gene coding for the 0.4 kb RNA was turned on within the first 30 min of spore formation. Although transcribed normally in a mutant blocked at stage II of spore development, the gene for the 0.4 kb RNA was not turned on in six different mutants blocked at stage 0 of sporulation. We conclude that the cloned B. subtilis DNA contains a gene whose transcription is regulated by events occurring at the onset of spore development."

https://openalex.org/W2065518285,"The sequence organization of the 1.688 satellite DNA (density 1.688 g/cm3 in CsCl) has been investigated, and this satellite has been found to differ from the other D. melanogaster satellite DNAs in having a much greater sequence complexity. Purification of 1.688 satellite DNA by successive equilibrium density centrifugations yielded a fraction 77% pure. Segments of satellite DNA were isolated by molecular cloning in the plasmid vector pSC101. One recombinant plasmid contained a segment of 1.688 satellite DNA 5.8 kilobase pairs in size and was stable during propagation in E. coli. Recognition sites for restriction enzymes from Haemophilus aegyptius (Hae III), Haemophilus influenzae f (Hinf) and Arthrobacter luteus (Alu I) were mapped in the satellite DNA of this hybrid plasmid. The spacing of Hae III, Hinf and two Alu I sites at regular intervals of about 365 base pairs is strong evidence that the sequence complexity of this satellite DNA is 365 base pairs. Further evidence comes from the finding that both gradient-purified and cloned 1.688 satellite DNA renature with their Hae III sites in register. The Hae III and Hinf sites in gradient-purified satellite DNA have been shown by Manteuil, Hamer and Thomas, 1975 Hamer D.L. Thomas Jr., C.A. The cleavage of Drosophila melanogaster DNA by restriction endonucleases. Chromosoma. 1975; 49: 243-267 Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar and Shen et al., 1976 Shen C.-K.J. Wiesehahn G. Hearst J.E. Cleavage patterns of Drosophila melanogaster satellite DNA by restriction enzymes. Nucl. Acids Res. 1976; 3: 931-951 Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar to be distributed at intervals of 365 base pairs and integral multiples thereof. These investigators proposed that some of the sites in an otherwise regular array have been randomly inactivated. Cloned satellite DNA provided a hybridization probe for sensitive studies of the arrangement of these recognition sites in gradient-purified satellite DNA. Some regions of satellite DNA were found to contain many fewer recognition sites than expected from the proposed models. These findings suggest that different regions of 1.688 satellite DNA may exhibit different arrangements of Hae III and Hinf recognition sites."
https://openalex.org/W2006567109,"Food-maintained responding by four squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) was suppressed by the presentation of electric shock (punishment). Two of these monkeys were experimentally naive and two had a history of responding maintained by both shock-postponement and shock-presentation schedules. In accord with earlier studies, d-amphetamine did not increase punished responding by naive monkeys. However, it did increase punished responding in the others. Subsequently, d-amphetamine also increased punished responding by the initially naive monkeys after they were trained under a shock-postponement schedule. Even though not evident in current behavior, an organism's prior experience can influence the behavioral effects of drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2018437242,"A plasmid with the vector Col E1 attached to an insert of Drosophila melanogaster DNA carrying four tRNA genes has been cloned in E. coli. Some features of the sequence arrangement and the positions of the tRNA genes have been determined by electron microscopic methods and by restriction endonuclease mapping. tRNA genes were mapped at 1.4, 4.7, 5.9 and 8.6 kb from one of the Drosophila/Col E1 junctions in the Drosophila insert of total length 9.34 kb. There are several secondary structure features consisting of inverted repeat sequences of length about 70-100 nucleotide pairs, some with and some without intervening loops, irregularly distributed on the insert. Cross-hybridization of tRNAs isolated by hybridization to separated restriction fragments indicate that the tRNA genes at 4.7, 5.9 and 8.6 kb are identical and differ from the one at 1.4 kb. Thus the positions of the genes, of the secondary structure features and of the restriction endonuclease sites all indicate that the spacers between the genes are not identical tandem repeats. In situ hybridization with cRNA transcribed from the plasmid showed localization at region 42A of chromosome 2R."
https://openalex.org/W147285319,"Highly purified alpha-thrombin has been chemically modified in an attempt to determine which features of the molecule are important for normal platelet-thrombin interactions. Modifying agents included diisopropylphosphorofluoridate and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-L-2-heptanone, which modify serine and histidine, respectively, at the catalytic site, as well as N-bromosuccinimide and 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide, which modify a single tryptophan at or near the fibrinogen-binding site. Active site-directed modification did not appreciably affect the binding characteristics, but prevented platelet activation. In contrast, modification of tryptophan at the macromolecular substrate-binding site resulted in the loss of high affinity binding of thrombin to platelets, while low affinity binding was apparently unaffected. This modification altered but did not abolish the ability of thrombin to effect platelet aggregation and release of [14C]serotonin. These results suggest that residues at the catalytic site are not involved in binding and that the macromolecular substrate-binding site of alpha-thrombin participates in high affinity binding to platelets. These data are also consistent with the existence of at least two types of binding sites for thrombin on the platelet surface as well as more than one platelet-binding region on the thrombin molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2061738008,"Abstract Serum from hamsters bearing group C adenovirus-induced tumors can be divided into two classes: first, a broad spectrum serum that contains antibodies to several early adenovirus proteins, immunoprecipitated from virus-infected cell extracts, with molecular weights of 72,000, 58,000, 44,000 and 17,000 daltons; and second, a narrow spectrum serum that contains antibodies to the 58,000 dalton protein from virus-infected cell extracts. Both types of sera have been used to immunoprecipitate specifically the 58,000 dalton protein from a type 2 adenovirus-transformed hamster cell line and a type 2 adenovirus-SV40 nondefective hybrid (Ad2 + ND-1) transformed hamster cell line. In addition, the broad spectrum serum immunoprecipitates or co-precipitates a late adenovirus protein of 120,000 daltons from virus-infected, but not virus-transformed cells. Peptide maps of the 120,000 dalton antigen and the virus hexon structural protein (120,000 daltons) demonstrate that these proteins are closely related. The 72,000 dalton antigen has been shown to be the adenovirus single-strand-specific DNA binding protein. Peptide maps of this 72,000 dalton antigen demonstrate that it contains all the peptides found in the 44,000 dalton antigen. The 72,000 dalton antigen contains two additional peptide fragments not detected in the 44,000 dalton protein, indicating that this 44,000 dalton antigen is a proteolytic breakdown product of the 72,000 dalton protein. The 58,000 dalton adenovirus tumor antigen has a peptide map which is completely distinct from the 120,000, 72,000 and 44,000 dalton proteins. These data demonstrate that the 58,000 dalton antigen is chemically distinct from the 72,000–44,000 dalton early adenovirus proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1985649743,"The distribution of three molecular weight subfractions of the Drosophila nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHC proteins) has been studied using an immunofluorescent technique ( Silver and Elgin, 1976 Silver L.M. Elgin S.C.R. A method for determination of the in situ distribution of chromosomal proteins. in: Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 73. 1976: 423-427 Google Scholar ). In all three cases, the fluorescence distribution patterns obtained are distinct and reproducible. The results imply that different NHC protein components have different distributions along the polytene chromosomes. A highly selective pattern is obtained using antiserum against subfraction ϱ; puffs (loci highly active in RNA synthesis) and many nonpuffed chromomeres which are known to puff at other times during the third larval instar or prepupal stages are brightly fluorescent. New RNA synthesis can be induced at 87A, 87B-C1 and other chromomeres by heat shock treatment; these loci, previously stained at low levels, are subsequently stained brightly using the ϱ serum. The staining of the heat shock puffs appears to be superimposed upon the prior ϱ pattern. The results suggest that a change in chromosomal structure, as indicated by staining using the ϱ serum, is associated with gene activity as indicated by puffing. This different chromosomal structure may be the consequence of either a redistribution of a ϱ antigenic determinant [a new association of specific protein(s) with the active sites] or a change in chromatin configuration [making the ϱ antigenic determinant(s) newly available to the antibody probe]."
https://openalex.org/W2017623542,"Abstract Segments of Drosophila melanogaster DNA containing 5S rRNA genes have been propagated in recombinant plasmids using E. coli as a host and Col E1 as a vector. Electron microscope partial denaturation mapping, mapping by ferritin labeling and restriction enzyme-gel electrophoresis analysis all indicate that the Drosophila DNA inserts of these plasmids consist of tandem repeats of 5S genes and spacer regions. The repeat length is approximately 380 nucleotide pairs (ntp), corresponding to a gene of length 120 ntp and a spacer of length 260 ntp. The insert in one plasmid (pCIT9) consists of 32 contiguous repeats. Restriction enzyme-gel electrophoresis analysis shows that all these repeats have the same length within ± 5 nucleotides. This repeat length is estimated as 370 ± 20 ntp by gel electrophoresis and 390 ± 40 ntp by partial denaturation mapping. A second plasmid (pCIT19) contains three complete genes, two complete spacers and incomplete flanking spacer sequences. The two complete repeat units released by suitable restriction endonuclease digestions differ in length by 20 ± 5 ntp, with estimated lengths of 370 and 390 ntp. The positions and spacings of the genes on this plasmid have been observed directly by ferritin labeling and by partial denaturation mapping. The A+T content of the 5S DNA spacer region is calculated to be 68%. By in situ hybridization, cRNA transcribed from one plasmid hybridizes to polytene chromosomes only at band 56F, the known locus of the 5S rRNA genes. Spontaneous excision of some of the tandem repeat units from the recombinant plasmids occurs during growth in E. coli; the frequency of excision does not depend upon the recA character of the host, but is greatly increased by chloramphenicol treatment."

https://openalex.org/W1545333508,"Mutants of Bacillus megaterium displaying malate-stimulated ATP synthesis resistant to uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation were isolated and partially characterized. ATP synthesis in such mutants was resistant to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone as well as to other uncouplers including 2,4-dinitrophenol, pentachlorophenol, and sodium azide. ATP synthesis in the wild type and in resistant mutants was sensitive to N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, tributyltin, valinomycin plus potassium, and potassium cyanide. Active transport of glycine and glutamine which are sensitive to uncouplers in the wild type was also uncoupler-sensitive in the mutants."

Hybridization to the sites of the ecdysone-induced puffs 74EF and 75B could be detected only if the RNA was labeled in the presence of ecdysone, while hybridization to the ecdysone-repressed puff 68C was found primarily in the cytoplasmic RNA sample labeled in the absence of ecdysone. Hybridization at the site of an ecdysone-insensitive puff, 50CD, was readily detectable in all RNA samples. RNA hybridizing to the unpuffed region 60D seemed to be restricted to the nucleus of salivary gland cells and was present at only a low level in cytoplasmic RNA samples. The data indicate that in situ hybridization can be used to detect specific hormone-induced changes in transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1968886589,"The clonal strain of pituitary tumor cells GH12C1 does not produce detectable amounts of prolactin (<5 ng/mg cell protein per 24 hr), although it does synthesize growth hormone. When GH12C1 cells were grown in the presence of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 3 μg/ml), the cells did produce prolactin as determined by quantitative microcomplement fixation and incorporation of 3H-leucine into 3H-prolactin. BGH12C1 and F1BGH12C1, two BrdU-resistant (r) substrains derived from GH12C1 which grow in the presence of 30 μg/ml BrdU, also synthesized prolactin (100–500 ng/mg cell protein per 24 hr). Growth of BrdUr strains was not dependent upon on the presence of the drug in the medium; however, the continued production of prolactin by F1BGH12C1 cells was dependent upon the presence of BrdU. Growth hormone production in both BrdUs and BrdUr strains was not affected by BrdU. Resistance of F1BGH12C1 cells to BrdU was not due to a defect in BrdU uptake. Thymidine inhibited the incorporation of 3H-BrdU into DNA in both sensitive and resistant strains, and also reduced BrdU-induced prolactin synthesis in F1BGH12C1. We postulate that induction of prolactin synthesis by BrdU in GH12C1 and F1BGH12C1 cells is mediated by the incorporation of the drug into cellular DNA. Furthermore, the lack of measurable prolactin synthesis by the parent strain GH12C1 is not due to deletion of the gene for prolactin, but is probably the result of regulatory mechanisms which do not permit expression of this gene."

When MDCK cells were cultured in the presence of benzo(alpha)pyrene and 7,8-benzoflavone, this increased release was not observed. MDCK cells incubated with benzo(a)pyrene also converted exogenous arachidonic acid into prostaglandins more effectively than cells grown in its absence. 7,8-Benzoflavone inhibited this benzo(a)pyrene effect. Microsomes, prepared from benzo(alpha)pyrene-treated MDCK cells synthesized prostaglandin F2alpha from arachidonic acid more effectively than nontreated cells."

Monkeys given the vaccine-adjuvant combination had earlier and significantly (P < .05) higher titers by 14 days compared to those that received vaccine alone. The potentiation of the antibody response of young monkeys given a split-virus vaccine in combination with poly(ICLC) suggests that this vaccine-adjuvant combination may similarly provide a potentially useful alternative approach to the immunization of pediatric and young adult age groups against swine influenza.
