https://openalex.org/W4213168521,"A semiconductor injection laser that differs in a fundamental way from diode lasers has been demonstrated. It is built out of quantum semiconductor structures that were grown by molecular beam epitaxy and designed by band structure engineering. Electrons streaming down a potential staircase sequentially emit photons at the steps. The steps consist of coupled quantum wells in which population inversion between discrete conduction band excited states is achieved by control of tunneling. A strong narrowing of the emission spectrum, above threshold, provides direct evidence of laser action at a wavelength of 4.2 micrometers with peak powers in excess of 8 milliwatts in pulsed operation. In quantum cascade lasers, the wavelength, entirely determined by quantum confinement, can be tailored from the mid-infrared to the submillimeter wave region in the same heterostructure material."
https://openalex.org/W2066000086,"High-resolution electron microscopy and lithium-7 nuclear magnetic resonance measurements were carried out for a disordered carbon material, prepared by heat treatment of polyphenylene, in which lithium was stored electrochemically. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum suggests the existence of Li(2) covalent molecules in the carbon material. This extra covalent site of lithium storage promises extraordinarily high energy density for secondary batteries."
https://openalex.org/W2001010481,"The discovery of two Earth-mass planets orbiting an old ( approximately 10(9) years), rapidly spinning neutron star, the 6.2-millisecond radio pulsar PSR B1257+12, was announced in early 1992. It was soon pointed out that the approximately 3:2 ratio of the planets' orbital periods should lead to accurately predictable and possibly measurable gravitational perturbations of their orbits. The unambiguous detection of this effect, after 3 years of systematic timing observations of PSR B1257+12 with the 305-meter Arecibo radiotelescope, as well as the discovery of another, moon-mass object in orbit around the pulsar, constitutes irrefutable evidence that the first planetary system around a star other than the sun has been identified."
https://openalex.org/W2064151322,"Saturn's diffuse E ring spans the region between 3 and 8 saturnian radii (R(s)), has its peak brightness near the orbit of the satellite Enceladus (3.95 R(s)), and is thought to be composed primarily of icy particles 1.0 +/- 0.3 micrometers in radius. Such particles are shown to move periodically along highly elliptical paths that cross the orbits of several saturnian satellites; the resulting energetic collisions of E ring particles with embedded satellites are capable of sustaining the E ring at its current optical depth. With several reasonable assumptions, this model naturally selects Enceladus as the primary source of ring material and may also provide mechanisms that explain the generation of the unusual amount of submicrometer dust in the neighboring F and G rings, the excess of OH molecules observed within the E ring, and the orbital brightness variations of nearby satellites."
https://openalex.org/W2042678889,"Before the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole, it was generally assumed that gas-phase chemical reactions controlled the abundance of stratospheric ozone. However, the massive springtime ozone losses over Antarctica first reported by Farman et al in 1985 could not be explained on the basis of gas-phase chemistry alone. In 1986, Solomon et al suggested that chemical reactions occurring on the surfaces of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) could be important for the observed ozone losses. Since that time, an explosion of laboratory, field, and theoretical research in heterogeneous atmospheric chemistry has occurred. Recent work has indicated that the most important heterogeneous reaction on PSCs is ClONO[sub 2] + HCl [yields] Cl[sub 2] + HNO[sub 3]. This reaction converts inert chlorine into photochemically active Cl[sub 2]. Photolysis of Cl[sub 2] then leads to chlorine radicals capable of destroying ozone through very efficient catalytic chain reactions. New observations during the second Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition found stoichiometric loss of ClONO[sub 2] and HCl in air processed by PSCs in accordance with reaction 1. Attention is turning toward understanding what kinds of aerosols form in the stratospheric, their formation mechanism, surface area, and specific chemical reactivity. Some of the latest findings, which underlinemore » the importance of aerosols, were presented at a recent National Aeronautics and Space Administration workshop in Boulder, Colorado.« less"
https://openalex.org/W1993260288,"Both flavins and carotenoids have some of the attributes expected for a photoreceptor mediating blue light-induced phototropism in plants. Besides the classical photoreceptor candidate, beta-carotene, coleoptiles contain many other carotenoids, including the main components of the xanthophyll cycle, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin. Here, dark-grown coleoptiles accumulated violaxanthin, but lacked zeaxanthin. Coleoptiles devoid of zeaxanthin did not bend in response to a blue light pulse. Coleoptile tips converted violaxanthin into zeaxanthin in the light. Manipulation of coleoptile zeaxanthin content by red light, red light plus darkness, or incubation with the inhibitor of zeaxanthin formation, dithiothreitol, resulted in a blue light-induced bending that was proportional to zeaxanthin content. These data indicate that zeaxanthin may be a blue light photoreceptor in corn coleoptiles."
https://openalex.org/W2073422521,"The (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratio in fish teeth separated from mid-Cretaceous marl and black shale from the northeastern Apennines and Venetian Alps (Italy) define three periods of low (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratio at 121 to 124 million years ago (Ma), 110 to 115 Ma, and 89 to 91 Ma. The (87)Sr/(86)Sr excursions correspond to oceanic anoxic events represented by the Livello Selli, Livello 113, Livello Urbino, and Livello Bonarelli black shale marker beds and probably reflect an increase in the low-(87)Sr/(86)Sr hydrothermal strontium flux associated with the emplacement of the Ontong-Java and Kerguelen plateaus (120 to 110 Ma) and the Caribbean Plateau (89 to 91 Ma). The modeled flux is consistent with the volumes and eruption rates of the oceanic plateaus but is far smaller than expected from the proposed Cretaceous crustal production rates of 50 to 100 percent greater than modern."
https://openalex.org/W2052866725,"A specific antigen was found in each of four races of Melampsora lini and four rust-differentiating varieties of Linum usitatissimum. Avirulence and virulence were related to resistance and susceptibility through the specific rust antigens. A race was virulent to varieties containing its specific rust antigen as a minor constituent, and avirulent to varieties lacking that antigen. No such correlation was found with flax antigens."

Precise analysis of electromagnetic couples on the conducting and magnetic parts of the satellite indicates a mean ambient geomagnetic field of 0.158 gauss, and confirms the eddy-current theory previously applied to Vanguard I."
https://openalex.org/W2009075143,"The Antarctic ozone hole results from catalytic destruction of ozone by chlorine radicals. The hole develops in August, reaches its full depth in early October, and is gone by early December of each year. Extremely low total ozone measurements were made at the Antarctic Dumont d'Urville station in 1958. These measurements were derived from spectrographic plates of the blue sky, the moon, and two stars. These Dumont plate data are inconsistent with 1958 Dobson spectrophotometer ozone measurements, inconsistent with present-day Antarctic observations, and inconsistent with meteorological and theoretical information. There is no credible evidence for an ozone hole in 1958."

https://openalex.org/W4239691808,"SAN FRANCISCO-Engineers, physicists, and other scientists interested in material behavior came together at the 1994 spring meeting of the Materials Research Society from 4 to 8 April. Among the 2200 papers given, researchers heard presentations on a variety of functional substances: a semiconductor suitable for a laser that gives off blue light, an improved magnetic refrigerator, and a method of keeping pollutants from forming in engine exhaust."
