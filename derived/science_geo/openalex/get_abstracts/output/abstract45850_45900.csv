https://openalex.org/W1501063278,"As an important new reagent for studying the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, a 20-residue peptide has been synthesized that corresponds to the active site of the skeletal muscle inhibitor protein. This synthetic peptide inhibits the protein kinase competitively with a Ki = 2.3 nM; its sequence, Thr-Thr-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Phe-Ile-Ala-Ser-Gly-Arg-Thr- Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-Ile-His-Asp, is that of a peptide previously reported by us which was derived from the native inhibitor protein by V8 protease digestion (Cheng, H. C., Van Patten, S. M., Smith, A. J., and Walsh, D. A. (1985) Biochem. J. 231, 655-661). Studies with analogues of this peptide show that its high affinity binding to the protein kinase (as also of the inhibitor protein) appears to be due to it mimicking the protein substrate by binding to the catalytic site via the arginine-cluster basic subsite (Formula: see text), and also to a critical contribution from one or more of the 6 N-terminal residues (Formula: see text). The availability of this high affinity synthetic peptide should open up a variety of avenues to probe the cellular actions of cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2128606349,"We have investigated the in vitro self-splicing of a class II mitochondrial intron. A model pre-mRNA containing intron 5 gamma of the oxi 3 gene of yeast mitochondrial DNA undergoes an efficient intramolecular rearrangement reaction in vitro. This reaction proceeds under conditions distinct from those optimal for self-splicing of class I introns, such as the Tetrahymena nuclear rRNA intron. Intron 5 gamma is excised as a nonlinear RNA indistinguishable from the in vivo excised intron product by gel electrophoresis and primer extension analysis. Studies of the in vitro excised intron product strongly indicate that it is a branched RNA with a circular component joined by a linkage other than a 3'-5' phosphodiester. Two other products, the spliced exons and the broken form of the lariat, were also characterized. These results show that the class II intron products are similar to those of nuclear pre-mRNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1679411437,"The DNA sequence of the gene for type 6 M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes contains two extended tandem repeat regions and one nontandem repeat region. We suggest that the duplication and deletion of these repeats generates the observed diversity in size and sequence among the family of M proteins in the group A streptococci. In addition, the DNA sequence reveals the presence of a 42-amino-acid signal peptide, a region rich in proline that is thought to be located in the cell wall, and a membrane anchor sequence at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. Signals similar to the consensus sequences recognized for the initiation of transcription and translation in Gram-positive bacteria have been identified in the DNA sequence. Codon usage is similar to that of other Gram-positive bacteria and significantly different from that of Escherichia coli."

https://openalex.org/W1520268659,"We have characterized the biochemical nature of the Ku protein, the antigen recognized by autoantibodies from certain patients with scleroderma-polymyositis overlap syndrome. From extracts of HeLa cells labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, anti-Ku antibodies precipitated a high molecular weight nucleic acid identified as DNA because of sensitivity to DNase I and resistance to RNase. From extracts of cells labeled with [35S] methionine, these antibodies precipitated two polypeptides of 70,000 and 80,000 Da. These proteins were purified using immunoaffinity column chromatography. In immunoblots most sera containing anti-Ku antibodies recognized both Ku proteins but one serum bound only to the 70,000-Da subunit. When nucleosomal segments of chromatin were used as antigen, anti-Ku antibodies precipitated dinucleosomes and larger forms of chromatin but not mononucleosomes. Thus, the Ku antigen is a novel DNA-binding protein that is at least partially exposed on nucleosomal segments of chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W2003263423,The cellular abl proto-oncogene encodes a protein-tyrosine kinase and is expressed in many cell types in two or three mRNA size species. Four types of mouse c-abl cDNAs have been cloned from 70Z/3 lymphoid cells that have different 5' sequences encoding predicted N-terminal regions of 20-45 amino acids. One of the four cDNAs has a predicted N-terminal sequence of met-gly-gln in common with the gag N terminus of v-abl. The 5' heterogeneity appears to be generated by alternative addition of 5' exons onto a common set of 3' exons. Alternative splicing occurs at the same site at which bcr sequences join to abl sequences in the Philadelphia chromosome translocation.
https://openalex.org/W2086853483,"Every eukaryotic and prokaryotic organism tested to date synthesizes a small number of heat-shock proteins in response to heat and other forms of stress. A particular pattern of heat-shock gene expression was observed during ascospore development in Saccharomyces: heat-shock proteins hsp26 and hsp84 were strongly induced nor inducible by heat shock. Instead, two proteins related to hsp70 were induced. A strikingly similar pattern of expression occurs during oogenesis in Drosophila, suggesting that it may be one of the earliest developmental pathways to evolve in eukaryotic cells."

https://openalex.org/W2066395372,"The crystal structures and enzymic properties of two mutant dihydrofolate reductases (Escherichia coli) were studied in order to clarify the functional role of an invariant carboxylic acid (aspartic acid at position 27) at the substrate binding site. One mutation, constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, replaces Asp27 with asparagine; the other is a primary-site revertant to Ser27. The only structural perturbations involve two internally bound water molecules. Both mutants have low but readily measurable activity, which increases rapidly with decreasing pH. The mutant enzymes were also characterized with respect to relative folate: dihydrofolate activities and kinetic deuterium isotope effects. It is concluded that Asp27 participates in protonation of the substrate but not in electrostatic stabilization of a positively charged, protonated transition state."
https://openalex.org/W2012195578,"A homologous cell-free system has been derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allows the translation, translocation, and glycosylation of the precursors of yeast mating factor alpha and invertase. The precursors were translated in a yeast lysate from mRNA obtained by in vitro transcription of the MF alpha 1 and SUC2 genes. Inclusion of yeast microsomes resulted in the glycosylation of the alpha-factor precursor, which was demonstrated to be sequestered within the membrane vesicles. Similar results, including signal sequence cleavage, were observed for invertase. Processing of secretory proteins translated in a yeast lysate could not be achieved using microsomes derived from canine pancreas, nor were yeast microsomes active in a wheat germ translation system."
https://openalex.org/W1981144806,"The transfer of specific Ti (tumor-inducing) plasmid sequences, the T-DNA, from Agrobacterium tumefaciens to a wide range of plants results in the formation of crown gall tumors. These tissues differ from most plant cells in that they can be grown in vitro in the absence of added phytohormones. Here, data are presented that offer an explanation for the auxin-independent phenotype of crown gall tissues. It is shown that crude cell-free extracts prepared from three bacterial species harboring pTiA6 gene 1 could convert L-tryptophan to indole-3-acetamide; control extracts lacking gene 1 could not carry out the reaction. Other reports indicate that the pTiA6 gene 2 product can convert indole-3-acetamide to indole-3-acetic acid, a naturally occurring auxin of plants. It is concluded that the auxin-independent phenotype of crown gall tissue involves the introduction of Ti plasmid sequences encoding a two-step pathway for auxin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2158195967,"Activated ras genes transform REF52 cells only at low frequencies and adenovirus early region 1A collaborates with ras oncogenes to convert REF52 cells to a tumorigenic phenotype. While failure to transform did not result from an absence of ras gene expression, E1A appeared to enhance expression of transfected ras genes by approximately tenfold. However, enhanced ras expression alone does not account for collaboration by E1A since overexpression of T24 Ha-ras p21 induced morphological crisis and cell growth arrest rather than stable transformation. These results indicate that E1A contributes complementing biochemical activities that enable ras genes to transform REF52 and suggest that the role of E1A in primary cell transformation may extend beyond facilitating in vitro establishment."

https://openalex.org/W1558538072,"A new protein that binds calmodulin has been identified and purified to greater than 95% homogeneity from the Triton X-100-insoluble residue of human erythrocyte ghost membranes (cytoskeletons) by DEAE chromatography and preparative rate zonal sucrose gradient sedimentation. This ghost calmodulin-binding protein is an alpha/beta heterodimer with subunits of Mr = 103,000 (alpha) and 97,000 (beta). The protein exhibits a Stokes radius of 6.9 nm and a sedimentation coefficient of 6.8 S, corresponding to a molecular weight of 197,000. Moreover, the protein is cross-linked by Cu2+/phenanthroline to a dimer of Mr = 200,000. The Mr = 97,000 beta subunit was identified as the calmodulin-binding site by photoaffinity labeling with 125I-azidocalmodulin. A 230 nM affinity for calmodulin was estimated by displacement of two different concentrations of the 125I-azidocalmodulin with unmodified calmodulin and subsequent Dixon plot analysis. This calmodulin-binding protein is present in erythrocytes at 30,000 copies/cell and is associated exclusively with the membrane. It is tightly bound to a site on red cell cytoskeletons and is totally solubilized in the low ionic strength extract derived from red cell ghost membranes. Visualization of this calmodulin-binding protein in the electron microscope by rotary shadowing, negative staining, and unidirectional shadowing indicates that it is a flattened circular molecule with a 12.4-nm diameter and a 5.4-nm height. Affinity-purified antibodies against the calmodulin-binding protein identify a cross-reacting Mr = 100,000 polypeptide(s) in brain membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1509898262,"Malignant transformation of mouse cells by a variety of agents or treatment with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate or platelet-derived growth factor results in increased synthesis and secretion of a 39,000-dalton protein termed major excreted protein (MEP). We report here that secreted MEP is an acid-activable protease. The secreted precursor form of the protease is auto-activated at low pH and is able to digest a variety of proteins, including the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. MEP protease activity has pH optimum of 3.3-3.6 and is temperature- and concentration-dependent. The activity is inhibited by sulfhydryl protease inhibitors such as leupeptin and iodoacetic acid and not by metallo-, seryl-, or carboxyprotease inhibitors. The MEP-derived protease has characteristics distinct from the cathepsins previously reported and thus may be a new acid-protease of mouse cells."
https://openalex.org/W1995297054,"Antibodies were raised in mice immunized with several recombinant and synthetic peptides of the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium falciparum. The antibodies were evaluated for protective activity in a human hepatocyte culture system. They exerted their protective effect against the parasite at three points: sporozoite attachment to the hepatocyte surface, entry, and subsequent intracellular development. Inhibition of attachment and entry were found to be related to the antibody titer against the authentic circumsporozoite protein on the sporozoite surface, especially when peptides were administered with alum or complete Freund's adjuvant. Even when invasion was not totally inhibited, the presence of abnormal trophozoites and a frequent inhibition of schizont development in long-term cultures suggested continued activity of antibodies at the intracellular level after sporozoite penetration had been completed."
https://openalex.org/W2014543676,Measurements confirm the quantitative theoretical prediction that the autonomic nonendocrine abnormality of rapid daytime gastric emptying is the major primary cause of the obesity resulting from ventromedial hypothalamic lesions in rats. Therapy for obesity could include slowing of stomach emptying.
https://openalex.org/W1595902031,"An extralysosomal tripeptide-releasing aminopeptidase was recently discovered in rat liver (Balow, R.-M., Ragnarsson, U., and Zetterqvist, O. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 11622-11628). In the present work this tripeptidyl peptidase is shown to occur in several rat tissues and in human erythrocytes. The erythrocyte enzyme was purified about 80,000-fold from a hemolysate while the rat liver enzyme was purified about 4,000-fold from a homogenate. Upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate under reducing conditions more than 90% of the protein was represented by a polypeptide of Mr 135,000 in both cases. In addition, the two enzymes eluted at similar positions in the various chromatographic steps, showed similar specific activity, and had a pH optimum around 7.5. A tryptic pentadecapeptide from the alpha-chain of human hemoglobin, Val-Gly-Ala-His-Ala-Gly-Glu-Tyr-Gly-Ala-Glu-Ala-Leu-Glu-Arg, i.e. residues 17-31, was found to be sequentially cleaved by the erythrocyte enzyme into five tripeptides, beginning from the NH2 terminus. Chromogenic tripeptidylamides showed various rates of hydrolysis at pH 7.5. With Ala-Ala-Phe-4-methyl-7-coumarylamide, Km was 16 microM and Vmax 13 mumol min-1 . mg-1, comparable to the standard substrate Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(32P)-Val-Ala values (Km 13 microM and Vmax 24 mumol . min-1 . mg-1). The tripeptidyl peptidase of human erythrocytes was classified as a serine peptidase from its irreversible inhibition by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The rate of inhibition was decreased by the presence of an efficient competitive inhibitor, Val-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Val-Ala (Ki 1.5 microM). [3H]Diisopropylphosphate was incorporated to the extent of 0.7-0.9 mol/mol of Mr 135,000 subunit, which confirms the high purity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2039994188,"Erythrocyte invasion by the malarial merozoite is a receptor-mediated process, an obligatory step in the development of the parasite. The Plasmodium falciparum protein GBP-130, which binds to the erythrocyte receptor glycophorin, is shown here to encode the binding site in a domain composed of a tandemly repeated 50 amino acid sequence. The amino acid sequence of GBP-130, deduced from the cloned and sequenced gene, reveals that the protein contains 11 highly conserved 50 amino acid repeats and a charged N-terminal region of 225 amino acids. Binding studies on recombinant proteins expressing different numbers of repeats suggest that a correlation exists between glycophorin binding and repeat number. Thus, a repeat domain, a common feature of plasmodial antigens, has been shown to have a function independent of the immune system. This conclusion is further supported by the ability of antibodies directed against the repeat sequence to inhibit the in vitro invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites."
https://openalex.org/W1506876043,"Methods are described for the partial purification of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae class III gene transcription factor TFIIIB from yeast whole cell extracts. A major component (30% of the total protein) of our most highly purified TFIIIB preparation was a polypeptide with an apparent Mr = 60,000 when analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This protein was purified by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and polyclonal antibodies were raised against it. Using immunological methods it was shown that TFIIIB transcription factor activity was associated with this purified polypeptide. Furthermore, the polyclonal sera raised against the yeast TFIIIB polypeptide was also shown to specifically neutralize the activity of the human TFIIIB equivalent when it was added to a human KB cell S-100 in vitro transcription system."
https://openalex.org/W2057544461,"Pf 155, a protein of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is strongly immunogenic in humans and is believed to be a prime candidate for the preparation of a vaccine. Human monoclonal antibodies to Pf 155 were obtained by cloning B cells that had been prepared from an immune donor and transformed with Epstein-Barr virus. When examined by indirect immunofluorescence, these antibodies stained the surface of infected erythrocytes, free merozoites, segmented schizonts, and gametocytes. They bound to a major polypeptide with a relative molecular weight of 155K and to two minor ones (135K and 120K), all having high affinity for human glycophorin. The antibodies strongly inhibited merozoite reinvasion in vitro, suggesting that they might be appropriate reagents for therapeutic administration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1603010024,"Abstract Purified polyclonal human antibodies (B-8) against the receptor for insulin (anti-R IgG), and their F(ab')2 and Fab' fragments, were used to study a possible role of receptor aggregation in the process that couples insulin binding with the activation of the insulin receptor kinase. Anti-R IgG, F(ab')2, and Fab' fragments were shown to inhibit insulin binding to solubilized partially purified receptor preparations from rat liver. This suggests that the antibodies and fragments bind near or at the insulin-binding site. Only anti-R IgG and its bivalent F(ab')2 fragments were capable of stimulating the receptor kinase activity. Monovalent Fab' fragments were completely devoid of such activity. Cross-linking of anti-R Fab' with goat anti-human Fab' restored the capability of the Fab' fragments to activate the receptor kinase. These data strongly suggest that receptor cross-linking or aggregation constitutes a sufficient trigger to activate the insulin-receptor kinase and could, therefore, be an important step in the transmembrane signaling process. This step presumably precedes the activation of the receptor kinase and the resulting phosphorylation of its protein substrates."

https://openalex.org/W2056518115,"The translational activity of a transfer RNA at a codon varies at different message sites, although the codon does not vary. The source of this effect, which may help to determine the level of gene expression, is generally agreed to be in nearby message sequences. By making every possible nucleotide combination between position 33 of the transfer RNA and the major context nucleotide of the message, it was shown that base-pairing between the two nucleotides is not the source of this context effect on translation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1607961060,Coproporphyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.3.) catalyzes the sixth enzymic step of the heme biosynthetic pathway. Coproporphyrinogen oxidase activity is increased in mutant cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient in heme synthesis and this effect can be partially reversed by the addition of exogenous hemin. A similar increase is found in wild type yeast cells grown anaerobically. The strain-dependent increase varies between 5- and 40-fold. The activity changes are paralleled by similar changes in the steady-state amounts of coproporphyrinogen oxidase protein determined by immunoblotting and the steady-state concentrations of coproporphyrinogen oxidase mRNA estimated by in vitro translation/immunoprecipitation. This demonstrates that coproporphyrinogen oxidase synthesis is regulated by heme and oxygen at a pretranslational level in a negative fashion.
https://openalex.org/W2043706804,"Yeast cells were transformed with a plasmid containing complementary DNA encoding the alpha subunit of the Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor. These cells synthesized a protein that had the expected molecular weight, antigenic specificity, and ligand-binding properties of the alpha subunit. The subunit was inserted into the yeast plasma membrane, demonstrating that yeast has the apparatus to express a membrane-bound receptor protein and to insert such a foreign protein into its plasma membrane. The alpha subunit constituted approximately 1 percent of the total yeast membrane. The alpha subunit constituted approximately 1 percent of the total yeast membrane proteins, and its density was about the same in the plasma membrane of yeast and in the receptor-rich electric organ of Electrophorus electricus. In view of the available technology for obtaining large quantities of yeast proteins, it may now be possible to obtain amplified amounts of interesting membrane-bound proteins for physical and biochemical studies."
https://openalex.org/W1540426778,"An unidentified open reading frame, 248 or 255 amino acids in length, on the maize chloroplast DNA fragment Bam5 was sequenced. It encodes a protein which contains a high proportion of hydrophilic amino acids, of which 22% are hydroxylated, interrupted by hydrophobic domains. A synthetic peptide corresponding to a hydrophilic sequence was used to generate antibodies. Western blots of photosystem I and II complexes prepared from maize and spinach thylakoids indicate that the psbG gene product is a membrane-associated protein of the photosystem II complex that migrates as a 24-kDa species on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1609833011,"Resolution of the fumarate reductase complex (ABCD) of Escherichia coli into reconstitutively active enzyme (AB) and a detergent preparation containing peptides C and D resulted in loss of quinone reductase activity, but the phenazine methosulfate or fumarate reductase activity of the enzyme was unaffected. An essential role for peptides C and D in quinone reduction was confirmed by restoration of this activity on recombination of the respective preparations. Neither peptide C nor peptide D by itself proved capable of permitting quinone reduction and membrane binding by the enzyme when E. coli cells were transformed with plasmids coding for the enzyme and the particular peptides. Transformation of a plasmid coding for all subunits resulted in a 30-fold increase in membrane-bound complex, which exhibited, however, turnover numbers for succinate oxidation and fumarate reduction that were intermediate between the high values characteristic of chromosomally produced complex and the relatively low values found for the isolated complex. It is also shown that preparations of the isolated complex and membrane-bound form of the enzyme, as obtained from anaerobically grown cells, are in the deactivated state owing to the presence of tightly bound oxalacetate and thus must be activated prior to assay."
https://openalex.org/W2010913718,"The catalytically essential amino acid in the active site of bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Ser-102) has been replaced with a cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting thiol enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of a variety of phosphate monoesters. The rate-determining step of hydrolysis, however, is no longer the same for catalysis when the active protein nucleophile is changed from the hydroxyl of serine to the thiol of cysteine. Unlike the steady-state kinetics of native alkaline phosphatase, those of the mutant show sensitivity to the leaving group of the phosphate ester."
https://openalex.org/W1600067717,"We have studied the biochemical mechanism of insulin action on glucose transport in the rat adipocyte. Plasma membranes and low-density microsomes were prepared by differential ultracentrifugation of basal and insulin-stimulated cells. The photochemical cross-linking agent hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate was used to covalently bind [3H]cytochalasin B to the glucose transporter which migrated as a 45-50-kDa protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Isoelectric focusing of the eluted 40-55-kDa proteins revealed two peaks of D-glucose-inhibitable [3H]cytochalasin B radioactivity focusing at pH 6.4 and 5.6 when low-density microsomes were used as the starting material. In contrast, only one D-glucose inhibitable peak, focusing at pH 5.6, was found in plasma membranes. Pretreatment of the cells with insulin led to a marked redistribution of the pH 5.6 form of the glucose transporter from low-density microsomes to plasma membranes with no effect on the pH 6.4 form of the glucose transporter. Following isolation from the isoelectric focusing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, both glucose transporter isoforms were shown to cross-react with an antiserum raised against the purified human erythrocyte glucose transporter. Following incubation of [3H]cytochalasin B-labeled low-density microsomal and plasma membranes with neuraminidase, the pH 5.6 transporter isoform was shifted on isoelectric focusing to a more basic pH, while the pH 6.4 isoform was not affected. These data demonstrate that: there is a heterogeneity of glucose transporter species in the intracellular pool while the plasma membrane transporters are more uniform in structure. The pH 5.6 glucose transporter isoform is translocated by insulin from the low-density microsomes to the plasma membrane but the pH 6.4 isoform is not sensitive to insulin. Differential sensitivity of the glucose transporter isoforms to neuraminidase suggests that the heterogeneity is at least partially due to differences in glycosylation state."
https://openalex.org/W1526080219,"The pairing of single- and double-stranded DNA molecules at homologous sequences promoted by recA and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins of Escherichia coli follows apparent first-order kinetics. The initial rate and first-order rate constant for the reaction are maximal at approximately 1 recA protein/3 and 1 single-stranded DNA-binding protein/8 nucleotides of single-stranded DNA. The initial rate increases with the concentration of duplex DNA; however, the rate constant is independent of duplex DNA concentration. Both the rate constant and extent of reaction increase linearly with increasing length of duplex DNA over the range 366 to 8623 base pairs. In contrast, the rate constant is independent of the size of the circular single-stranded DNA between 6,400 and 10,100 nucleotides. No significant effect on reaction rate is observed when a single-stranded DNA is paired with 477 base pairs of homologous duplex DNA joined to increasing lengths of heterologous DNA (627-2,367 base pairs). Similarly, heterologous T7 DNA has no effect on the rate of pairing. These findings support a mechanism in which a recA protein-single-stranded DNA complex interacts with the duplex DNA to produce an intermediate in which the two DNA molecules are aligned at homologous sequences. Conversion of the intermediate to a paranemic joint then occurs in a rate-determining unimolecular process."
https://openalex.org/W1488898406,"The membrane carrier for L-proline (product of the putP gene) of Escherichia coli K12 was solubilized and functionally reconstituted with E. coli phospholipid by the cholate dilution method. The counterflow activity of the reconstituted system was studied by preloading the proteoliposomes with either L-proline or the proline analogues: L-azetidine-2-carboxylate or 3,4-dehydro-L-proline. The dilution of such preloaded proteoliposomes into a buffer containing [3H]proline resulted in the accumulation of this amino acid against a considerable concentration gradient. A second driving force for proline accumulation was an electrochemical potential difference for Na+ across the membrane. More than a 10-fold accumulation was seen with a sodium electrochemical gradient while no accumulation was found with proton motive force alone. The optimal pH for the L-proline carrier activities for both counterflow and sodium gradient-driven uptake was between pH 6.0 and 7.0. The stoichiometry of the co-transport system was approximately one Na+ for one proline. The effect of different phospholipids on the proline transport activity of the reconstituted carrier was also studied. Both phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol stimulate the carrier activity while phosphatidylcholine and cardiolipin were almost inactive."
https://openalex.org/W1569948590,"The requirement for the glycine residue at the COOH terminus of the signal peptide of the precursor of the major Escherichia coli outer membrane lipoprotein was examined. Using oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis, this residue was replaced by residues of increasing side chain size. Substitution by serine had no effect on the modification or processing of the prolipoprotein. Substitution by valine or leucine resulted in the accumulation of the unmodified precursor, whereas threonine substitution resulted in slow lipid modification and no detectable processing of the lipid modified precursor. The results indicate that serine is the upper limit on size for the residue at the cleavage site. Larger residues at this position prevent the action of both the glyceride transferase and signal peptidase II enzymes, indicating that the cleavage site residue plays a role in events prior to proteolytic cleavage. The upper limit on size of the cleavage site residue is similar to that found for exported proteins cleaved by signal peptidase I, as well as eucaryotic exported proteins. The possibility that the cleavage site residue may have a role other than active site recognition by the signal peptidase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1539201394,"Cobalamin (Cbl) transport across the outer membrane of cells of Escherichia coli consists of high affinity Cbl binding to the btuB protein of the Cbl receptor, followed by the proton motive force- and tonB-dependent release of the Cbl into the periplasmic space. During a search for experimental conditions that would mimic this release in vitro with isolated cell envelope particles, we found that calcium was required for the high affinity Cbl binding, and subsaturating calcium concentrations resulted in the decreased affinity of the Cbl receptor for Cbl. The apparent affinity of the Cbl receptor for calcium (KD, approximately 30 nM at pH 6.6) decreased with decreasing pH, resulting in decreased affinity for Cbl at lower pH values. With suboptimal levels of calcium, Cbl binding was decreased by millimolar levels of magnesium."
https://openalex.org/W1566426209,"The dihydrofolate reductase encoded by plasmid pUK1123, which confers only a moderate level of trimethoprim resistance on its host, has been isolated and characterized. This enzyme, designated type IV, differs markedly from all previously described plasmid dihydrofolate reductases. It has a relatively high molecular weight of 46,700 as measured by gel filtration and, unlike previous plasmid dihydrofolate reductases, its synthesis is induced in the presence of increasing concentrations of trimethoprim. It is only slightly resistant to trimethoprim but is competitively inhibited by this drug with an inhibitor binding constant of 63 nM. In addition, the enzyme has a relatively low affinity for the substrate, dihydrofolate (Km = 37 microM). This is the first report of a plasmid trimethoprim resistance mechanism resulting from the induced synthesis of a large molecular weight dihydrofolate reductase which is only slightly resistant to trimethoprim. The possible origins of the type IV enzyme are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1508336070,"Removal of cell surface sialic acid from adipocytes with neuraminidase inhibits insulin action. Here, we have examined the effects of mild neuraminidase treatment (5 milliunits/ml, 12 degrees C, 15 min) on insulin receptor structure and function. Neuraminidase treatment sufficient to cause greater than 90% loss of insulin stimulatable lipogenesis had no effect on 125I-insulin binding, tyrosine kinase activity of partially purified insulin receptors, insulin receptor phosphorylation in intact cells, or insulin-induced receptor internalization. However, recycling of the insulin receptor to the plasma membrane was inhibited by 50%. Recycled receptors in neuraminidase-treated cells were unable to mediate insulin action in contrast to recycled receptors from non-neuraminidase-treated cells. Furthermore, when insulin receptors were protected from exposure to neuraminidase, by inducing receptor internalization prior to neuraminidase treatment, the cells were still unable to respond to insulin. Analysis of the alpha and beta subunits of the receptor from neuraminidase-treated cells, affinity-labeled with 125I-insulin, or labeled by autophosphorylation, and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis failed to indicate any changes in the holoreceptor or the individual subunits. This suggests there was no detectable release of sialic acid from the receptor. From this data we conclude that loss of sialic acid from nonreceptor glycoconjugates leads to loss of insulin action and inhibition of receptor recycling. The insulin receptor does not appear to be involved in this inhibitory effect. These findings suggest that an uncharacterized plasma membrane glycoprotein is essential in transmitting the signal of insulin binding to the cellular effector system."
https://openalex.org/W2093371025,"Self-splicing of the precursor to large ribosomal RNA of yeast mitochondria leads not only to circles but also to lariats, structures that have not been observed before as products of self-splicing. Lariats were studied by electron microscopy after hybridization with an RNA complementary to the 3′ half of the precursor. This leads to differentiation in at least two classes of lariats that vary in the position of the branch point. In all lariats the tail carries the 3′ end, which suggests that a 5′ end is used for branch formation with an internal nucleotide. The circles are formed from excised introns. They lack only three nucleotides encoded by mitochondrial DNA along with the 5′-terminal G added in the course of self-splicing. The diverse number of self-splicing products arising in vitro testifies to the considerable reactivity of this intron. The formation of lariats in an RNA catalyzed reaction may have implications for views on the mechanism of splicing of nuclear pre-mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1566665886,"The kinetics of insulin binding to isolated rat epididymal fat cells was investigated at 15 degrees C, at which temperature the system was simplified by the absence of lysosomal insulin degradation. The data were fit by maximum likelihood criteria with differential equations describing a number of models for the interaction of insulin and cells. Among those models that yielded a fit, the selection criteria were minimization of the Akaike information criterion and compatibility of the overall equilibrium constant for the system calculated from rate constants with the previously obtained experimental value. The results of the analysis indicated that insulin, I, first reversibly bound to cell surface receptors, R, whereupon this initial insulin-receptor complex, RI, reversibly altered its state or cellular location to R'I, according to the following equation. (Formula: see text) No evidence was found that insulin could either associate or dissociate from R'I directly. The association rate constant was kappa 12 = 1.6 x/divided by 1.4 X 10(5) liter mol-1 s-1, a value shown to be incompatible with diffusion control. The other rate constants were: kappa 21 = 3.4 x/divided by 1.6 X 10(-3) s-1, kappa 23 = 3.2 x/divided by 1.5 X 10(-4) s-1, and kappa 32 = 2.0 x/divided by 1.5 X 10(-4) s-1. From these rate constants, an equilibrium constant of 8.4 x/divided by 1.5 nM was calculated, in excellent agreement with the previously measured value of 8.8 x/divided by 1.3 nM (Lipkin, E. W., Teller, D. C., and de Haen, C. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1694-1701). The kinetic analysis also yielded receptor numbers similar to those obtained by equilibrium binding studies. The nature of the R'I state is discussed in terms of an internalized state, in terms of insulin receptor complex in caveolae, in terms of receptor aggregates, and in terms of being a Michaelis complex between insulin bound to the receptor and cell surface-bound insulin protease."
https://openalex.org/W1605682544,"The structure of the binding site for the monovalent cation activator of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthetase from Escherichia coli has been characterized by 205Tl NMR of enzyme-bound Tl+. The chemical shift of the enzyme-Tl+ complex is 176 ppm downfield from aquo Tl+, a shift which is typical only of Tl+ complexes with solely oxygen ligands. The 205Tl resonance shifts upfield to 85 ppm in the enzyme-Mg(II)-Tl+ complex, to 38 ppm in the enzyme-Tl+-AdoMet complex and to 34 ppm in the enzyme-Tl+-AdoMet-Mg(II) complex. The 205Tl chemical shift of enzyme-bound Tl+ was not altered by binding of either methionine, or the Mg(II)-ATP analog Mg(II)-adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, or Mg(II)-pyrophosphate to the enzyme-Tl+-Mg(II) complex. The NMR data suggest that the substrates or products of the enzyme do not coordinate to the monovalent cation activator and imply that monovalent cation activation results from alterations in protein conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1556416112,"The structure and the mechanism for proteinase inhibition of the egg white protein ovostatin (ovomacroglobulin) are similar to those of plasma alpha 2-macroglobulin, but previous studies have shown that chicken ovostatin lacks a reactive thiol ester (Nagase, H., and Harris, E. D., Jr. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7490-7498). Here we show that duck ovostatin has conserved such a thiol ester and is capable of inhibiting both metallo- and serine proteinases stoichiometrically. Evidence for thiol esters was established by the following results with duck ovostatin: 1) autolysis into fragments of Mr = 123,000 and 60,000 occurred by heating in sodium dodecyl sulfate, but was prevented by treatment with CH3NH2; 2) covalent linkages were formed with proteinases on complex formation; 3) reaction with CH3NH2 generated 3.6 SH groups/mol, and 3.9 mol of [14C]CH3NH2 were incorporated per mol of protein; and 4) saturation with a proteinase liberated 3.8 SH groups/mol of the inhibitor. Conformational rearrangement of duck ovostatin upon reacting with CH3NH2 or proteinases was demonstrated by an increased mobility of the protein in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. CH3NH2-treated duck ovostatin was able to bind and inhibit proteinases without forming covalent bonds, but, unlike unmodified ovostatin, its inhibitory activity was destroyed by freezing and thawing. Complexes formed between CH3NH2-treated duck ovostatin and a proteinase were not dissociable except under denaturing conditions. These results and other evidence indicate that covalent bond formation through reaction with a thiol ester is a separate process from the trapping and inhibition of proteinases by this family of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1893927637,"Ribosomal protein L11 is one of only two ribosomal proteins significantly iodinated when Escherichia coli 50 S subunits are modified by immobilized lactoperoxidase, and the major target has been shown previously to be tyrosine at position 7 in the N-terminal domain. This modification reduces in vitro termination activity with release factor (RF)-1 by 70-90%, but RF-2 activity is less affected (30-50%). The loss of activity parallels incorporation of iodine into the subunit. The 50 S subunits from L11-lacking strains of bacteria have highly elevated activity with RF-2 and low activity with RF-1. The iodination does not affect RF-2 activity but reduces the RF-1 activity further. Ribosomal proteins, L2, L6, and L25, are significantly labeled in L11-lacking ribosomes in contrast to the control 50 S subunits. L11 has been modified in isolation and incorporated back efficiently into L11-lacking ribosomes. This L11, iodinated also predominantly at Tyr 7, is unable to restore RF-1 activity to L11-lacking ribosomes in contrast to mock-iodinated protein. These results suggest the involvement of the N terminus of L11 in the binding domain of the bacterial release factors and indicate that there are subtle differences in how the two factors interact with the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W1593539367,"MAP3 is a novel microtubule-associated protein found in brain and a variety of other tissues (Huber, G., Alaimo-Beuret, D., and Matus, A. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 100, 496-507). In this study, monoclonal antibodies were used to assess its influence on the polymerization of brain tubulin. When added to unpolymerized brain microtubules, anti-MAP3 IgG produced a dose-related inhibition of subsequent assembly. Under the same circumstances, nonimmune mouse IgG did not influence either the rate or the extent of tubulin polymerization. We also used immobilized antibodies to deplete brain MAPs selectively in either MAP3 or MAP1. MAP3-depleted MAPs showed a reproducible decrease in activity compared to control preparations that had been exposed to immobilized nonimmune IgG. MAP1-depleted MAPs did not differ significantly in performance from the nonimmune treated controls. We conclude that MAP3 contributes to the net assembly of brain microtubules observed in vitro. This may be particularly relevant in neonatal animals where brain MAP3 is more abundant than in the adult."
https://openalex.org/W1525177759,"The effects of cell aging on insulin binding and on insulin receptor processing in human erythrocytes were studied. Erythrocytes were found to exponentially lose equal proportions of both high and low affinity receptors as a function of age. The affinities of remaining surface receptors did not change significantly. The maximum extent of insulin receptor down-regulation that could be induced decreased linearly with age over the range studied. Together with dose-response and time course studies, these age-related changes in insulin binding and receptor down-regulation were used to develop a kinetic model in which receptor internalization is a function of surface receptor concentration. The ability of the model to predict the behavior of a heterogeneous population suggests that changes in receptor processing with age may be attributed to changes in the surface receptor concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1569932229,"The 400-MHz 1H NMR spectra of the subunit B2 of ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli show paramagnetically shifted resonances at 24 ppm (exchangeable protons) and at 19 ppm (nonexchangeable protons). The protein contains an antiferromagnetically coupled dimeric iron center and a tyrosyl free radical. The paramagnetically shifted resonances must be due to the iron center, since they remain essentially unchanged in protein B2 with and without free radical. In analogy with recently published results for hemerythrin from Phascolopsis gouldii, which has a similar iron center, the 24-ppm resonance is suggested to arise from histidine ligands to the iron ions."
https://openalex.org/W1570418777,"Equilibrium of insulin to isolated rat epididymal fat cells was investigated. A temperature of 15 degrees C was chosen for the study to minimize lysosomal degradation of insulin. Indeed, medium insulin lost only 1% of its precipitability in trichloroacetic acid during the 4-h incubation required to approach equilibrium. Binding was measured by a method that did not perturb the equilibrium of the system. A new formalism for analyzing data in general was introduced. A for of insulin in the interstitial space of cell pellets was both necessary and sufficient to derive specific data from raw observations. Thus, so-called nonspecific binding was unmasked as a misnomer, and the expression correction for trapping was proposed as a substitute. Equations for one and two independent classes of sites were fit to the data by the method of maximum likelihood, and the best fit was selected based on Akaike's information criterion, as adapted for a constant fractional error. More than 99.7% of the sites were found to be describable by a simple isotherm with Kd,app = 8.8 multiplied by over divided by 1.3 nM. Less than 0.3% sites had a higher affinity (Kd approximately equal to 8 multiplied by over divided by 3 pM). There were 99,000 x/divided by 1.6 sites/cell. These equilibrium parameters are in agreement with values derived from a kinetic analysis, presented in the subsequent paper (Lipkin, E. W., Teller, D. C., and de Haen, C. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 1702-1711)."
https://openalex.org/W1547931893,"We have examined the insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in the isolated plasma membranes of 3T3-F442A adipocytes. Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor is detected readily in the plasma membrane of these cells by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and under nonreducing conditions, the predominant species of phosphorylated insulin receptor has an apparent molecular mass of 350,000 daltons with the beta-subunit (92,000 daltons) being phosphorylated. The phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in the isolated plasma membrane is absolutely dependent on insulin; tyrosine residues and, to a lesser extent, serine residues of the receptor are phosphorylated. Treatment of the plasma membrane with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) has two effects; 1) NEM prevents the formation of a larger form (greater than 350,000 daltons) of the phosphorylated insulin receptor. The formation of this larger form of the receptor involves sulfhydryl oxidation which occurs at 37 degrees C under nondenaturing conditions, but does not occur at 0 degrees C or at room temperature even in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. These results indicate that the larger form of the phosphorylated receptor can occur under physiological conditions and suggest that this process may be relevant to aggregation of the receptor-ligand complex. 2) Prior to treatment with insulin, NEM enhances the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. Phosphopeptide analysis indicates that the site(s) of phosphorylation of the receptor is identical in the presence or absence of NEM."
https://openalex.org/W1570774596,"The major extracellular protein of Penicillium cyclopium has been isolated from its culture media and purified by ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel, and ion-exchange chromatography. We show this secreted protein to be endopeptidase. The molecular weight is approximately 32,000, the pI is 5.0, and the pH optimum using a variety of protein and synthetic substrates is around 7.0. Inhibition studies show that the protease is not inhibited by pepstatin nor by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, indicating, respectively, that it is not an aspartyl protease nor a thiol protease. Complete inhibition is observed, however, with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Three crystal forms suitable for high resolution x-ray diffraction studies have been obtained from this purified protease with reflections being observed to well beyond 3.0 A resolution. One form having a needle morphology is of the orthorhombic crystal class and has space group P2(1)2(1)2(1). The unit cell dimensions are a = 41.9 A, b = 43.2 A, and c = 111.5 A with 1 molecule of the protease occurring in the asymmetric unit. The second form grown at pH values less than 6.0 has a plate morphology, is of orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), and has unit cell dimensions a = 59.12 A, b = 62.33 A, and c = 70.62 A. The third form is polyhedral in habit, is also of space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), and appears when the pH of the mother liquor is greater than 7.0. The cell dimensions of this crystal form are a = 57.07 A, b = 58.82 A, c = 70.79 A, and again there is 1 molecule/asymmetric unit. Three-dimensional structural analysis by x-ray diffraction is now underway. All crystal forms are somewhat denser than the norm having mass to volume ratios of 1.58, 2.00, and 1.85 A3/dalton, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1585595553,"Rat liver sterol carrier protein (SCP) is a major intracellular protein regulating lipid metabolism and transport. During a dark-light cycle, SCP undergoes a dramatic diurnal variation in synthesis and level, reflecting translational events. Several hormones participate in the control of SCP synthesis. Insulin was implicated when the circadian rhythm of SCP was lost in both diabetes and fasting, states where insulin is low. After a 12-h fast the amplitude of the diurnal rhythm is diminished; after a 48-h fast it disappears, although SCP synthesis and level remain high. When endogenous insulin secretion is increased in fasted rats by glucose administration, SCP increases 2-fold in less than 30 min. When food intake is manipulated, but the dark-light cycle is unchanged, the circadian rhythm of SCP corresponds to feeding patterns and not light cycling. During feeding, increases in SCP are triggered following the expected increase in serum insulin. However, SCP is rapidly and significantly elevated in response to insulin only when glucocorticoids are normally high or increased by injection of the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. Hepatocyte SCP levels are also induced by a combination of insulin and dexamethasone (2.3-fold) or insulin alone (1.3-fold). Dexamethasone alone causes a striking depression of SCP (2.4-fold). Thus, insulin is a major regulator of the diurnal variation of SCP synthesis. Glucocorticoids and other hormones (e.g. triiodothyronine) are also essential for maximum induction of SCP but play permissive roles."
https://openalex.org/W1588778375,"Thioredoxin was cross-linked to a membrane fraction in vivo using the heterobifunctional photoreactive cross-linking reagent p-azidophenacyl bromide, chosen to couple thioredoxin via its highly reactive thiol. Under mild reaction conditions, a significant amount of thioredoxin (30%) was rapidly cross-linked to the crude membrane fraction. The cross-linking reaction was selective, with thioredoxin purified 15-fold in the cross-linked membrane fraction. Membrane fractionation studies showed that thioredoxin associated with the inner membrane and with a hybrid membrane fraction. This hybrid membrane fraction banded at a density between the inner and outer membranes. This result is consistent with the localization of thioredoxin in association with the bacterial membrane adhesion sites first described by Bayer (Bayer, M. (1968) J. Gen. Microbiol. 53, 395-404). Association of thioredoxin with the membrane adhesion sites defines a structure corresponding to the osmotically sensitive cytoplasmic compartment (Lunn, C. A., and Pigiet, V. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11424-11430)."
