https://openalex.org/W2073875806,"Astronauts on a mission to Mars would be exposed for up to 3 years to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) — made up of high-energy protons and high charge (Z) and energy (E) (HZE) nuclei. GCR exposure rate increases about three times as spacecraft venture out of Earth orbit into deep space where protection of the Earth's magnetosphere and solid body are lost. NASA's radiation standard limits astronaut exposures to a 3% risk of exposure induced death (REID) at the upper 95% confidence interval (CI) of the risk estimate. Fatal cancer risk has been considered the dominant risk for GCR, however recent epidemiological analysis of radiation risks for circulatory diseases allow for predictions of REID for circulatory diseases to be included with cancer risk predictions for space missions. Using NASA's models of risks and uncertainties, we predicted that central estimates for radiation induced mortality and morbidity could exceed 5% and 10% with upper 95% CI near 10% and 20%, respectively for a Mars mission. Additional risks to the central nervous system (CNS) and qualitative differences in the biological effects of GCR compared to terrestrial radiation may significantly increase these estimates, and will require new knowledge to evaluate."

Yet, the combined effects of elevated pCO2 and temperature on coral physiology and resilience remain poorly understood. While coral calcification and energy reserves are important health indicators, no studies to date have measured energy reserve pools (i.e., lipid, protein, and carbohydrate) together with calcification under OA conditions under different temperature scenarios. Four coral species, Acropora millepora, Montipora monasteriata, Pocillopora damicornis, Turbinaria reniformis, were reared under a total of six conditions for 3.5 weeks, representing three pCO2 levels (382, 607, 741 µatm), and two temperature regimes (26.5, 29.0°C) within each pCO2 level. After one month under experimental conditions, only A. millepora decreased calcification (−53%) in response to seawater pCO2 expected by the end of this century, whereas the other three species maintained calcification rates even when both pCO2 and temperature were elevated. Coral energy reserves showed mixed responses to elevated pCO2 and temperature, and were either unaffected or displayed nonlinear responses with both the lowest and highest concentrations often observed at the mid-pCO2 level of 607 µatm. Biweekly feeding may have helped corals maintain calcification rates and energy reserves under these conditions. Temperature often modulated the response of many aspects of coral physiology to OA, and both mitigated and worsened pCO2 effects. This demonstrates for the first time that coral energy reserves are generally not metabolized to sustain calcification under OA, which has important implications for coral health and bleaching resilience in a high-CO2 world. Overall, these findings suggest that some corals could be more resistant to simultaneously warming and acidifying oceans than previously expected."
https://openalex.org/W2170356930,"Chronic inflammation is associated with cachexia-induced skeletal muscle mass loss in cancer. Levels of IL-6 cytokine family members are increased during cancer-related cachexia and induce intracellular signaling through glycoprotein130 (gp130). Although muscle STAT3 and circulating IL-6 are implicated in cancer-induced muscle wasting, there is limited understanding of muscle gp130's role in this process. Therefore, we investigated the role of skeletal muscle gp130 (skm-gp130) in cancer-induced alterations in the regulation of muscle protein turnover. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected into 8-wk-old skm-gp130-knockout (KO) mice or wild-type mice. Skeletal muscle loss was attenuated by 16% in gp130-KO mice, which coincided with attenuated LLC-induced phosphorylation of muscle STAT3, p38, and FOXO3. gp130 KO did not restore mTOR inhibition or alter AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression. The induction of atrogin expression and p38 phosphorylation in C2C12 myotubes exposed to LLC-treated medium was attenuated by gp130 inhibition, but mTOR inhibition was not restored. STAT signaling inhibition in LLC-treated myotubes did not attenuate the induction of p38 or AMPK phosphorylation. We concluded that, during LLC-induced cachexia, skm-gp130 regulates muscle mass signaling through STAT3 and p38 for the activation of FOXO3 and atrogin, but does not directly regulate the suppression of mTOR."
https://openalex.org/W2075337132,"The development of a suitable three dimensional (3D) culture system for anticancer drug development remains an unmet need. Despite progress, a simple, rapid, scalable and inexpensive 3D-tumor model that recapitulates in vivo tumorigenesis is lacking. Herein, we report on the development and characterization of a 3D nanofibrous scaffold produced by electrospinning a mixture of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and a block copolymer of polylactic acid (PLA) and mono-methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG) designated as 3P. Cancer cells cultured on the 3P scaffold formed tight irregular aggregates similar to in vivo tumors, referred to as tumoroids that depended on the topography and net charge of the scaffold. 3P scaffolds induced tumor cells to undergo the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as demonstrated by up-regulation of vimentin and loss of E-cadherin expression. 3P tumoroids showed higher resistance to anticancer drugs than the same tumor cells grown as monolayers. Inhibition of ERK and PI3K signal pathways prevented EMT and reduced tumoroid formation, diameter and number. Fine needle aspirates, collected from tumor cells implanted in mice when cultured on 3P scaffolds formed tumoroids, but showed decreased sensitivity to anticancer drugs, compared to tumoroids formed by direct seeding. These results show that 3P scaffolds provide an excellent platform for producing tumoroids from tumor cell lines and from biopsies and that the platform can be used to culture patient biopsies, test for anticancer compounds and tailor a personalized cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2077028400,"Chemokines display considerable promiscuity with multiple ligands and receptors shared in common, a phenomenon that is thought to underlie their biochemical ""redundancy."" Their receptors are part of a larger seven-transmembrane receptor superfamily, commonly referred to as G protein-coupled receptors, which have been demonstrated to be able to signal with different efficacies to their multiple downstream signaling pathways, a phenomenon referred to as biased agonism. Biased agonism has been primarily reported as a phenomenon of synthetic ligands, and the biologic prevalence and importance of such signaling are unclear. Here, to assess the presence of biased agonism that may underlie differential signaling by chemokines targeting the same receptor, we performed a detailed pharmacologic analysis of a set of chemokine receptors with multiple endogenous ligands using assays for G protein signaling, β-arrestin recruitment, and receptor internalization. We found that chemokines targeting the same receptor can display marked differences in their efficacies for G protein- or β-arrestin-mediated signaling or receptor internalization. This ligand bias correlates with changes in leukocyte migration, consistent with different mechanisms underlying the signaling downstream of these receptors induced by their ligands. These findings demonstrate that biased agonism is a common and likely evolutionarily conserved biological mechanism for generating qualitatively distinct patterns of signaling via the same receptor in response to different endogenous ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2055346401,"After the initial formation of a highly branched vascular plexus, blood vessel pruning generates a hierarchically structured network with improved flow characteristics. We report here on the cellular events that occur during the pruning of a defined blood vessel in the eye of developing zebrafish embryos. Time-lapse imaging reveals that the connection of a new blood vessel sprout with a previously perfused multicellular endothelial tube leads to the formation of a branched, Y-shaped structure. Subsequently, endothelial cells in parts of the previously perfused branch rearrange from a multicellular into a unicellular tube, followed by blood vessel detachment. This process is accompanied by endothelial cell death. Finally, we show that differences in blood flow between neighboring vessels are important for the completion of the pruning process. Our data suggest that flow induced changes in tubular architecture ensure proper blood vessel pruning."
https://openalex.org/W1992876453,"The red palm weevil (RPW) is a major pest of palms. It is native to southeast Asia and Melanesia, but in recent decades has vastly expanded its range as the result of multiple accidental anthropogenic introductions into the Middle East, Mediterranean Basin, Caribbean, and U.S.A. Currently regarded as a single species, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier), RPW displays remarkable color variation across its range, and consequently has a taxonomic history littered with new species descriptions and synonymization. We compared DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from RPW populations throughout the native and invaded ranges, to investigate the specific status and invasion history of this serious economic pest, and to identify possible common routes of entry. Analyses of COI haplotype data provide conclusive support, corroborated by sequences of additional nuclear gene regions, for the existence of at least two predominantly allopatric species. The true R. ferrugineus is native only to the northern and western parts of continental southeast Asia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines, and is responsible for almost all invasive populations worldwide. In contrast, the second species, which is currently synonymized under R. ferrugineus and should be resurrected under the name R. vulneratus (Panzer), has a more southern distribution across Indonesia, and is responsible for only one invasive population; that in California, U.S.A. The distribution of COI haplotypes is used to discuss the possible existence of further cryptic species, sources and routes of entry of different invasive populations, and the implications of our findings for current control methods."
https://openalex.org/W2064672639,"The reconstitution of anti-viral cellular immunity following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is crucial in preventing cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated complications. Thus immunological monitoring has emerged as an important tool to better target pre-emptive anti-viral therapies. However, traditional laboratory-based assays are too cumbersome and complicated to implement in a clinical setting. Here we conducted a prospective study of a new whole blood assay (referred to as QuantiFERON-CMV®) to determine the clinical utility of measuring CMV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses as a prognostic tool. Forty-one evaluable allogeneic HSCT recipients underwent weekly immunological monitoring from day 21 post-transplant and of these 21 (51.2%) showed CMV reactivation and 29 (70.7%) developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD). Patients with acute GvHD (grade ≥ 2) within 6 weeks of transplant showed delayed reconstitution of CMV-specific T-cell immunity (p = 0.013) and a higher risk of CMV viremia (p = 0.026). The median time to stable CMV-specific immune reconstitution was 59 days and the incidence of CMV reactivation was lower in patients who developed this than those who did not (27% versus 65%; p = 0.031). Furthermore, a failure to reconstitute CMV-specific immunity soon after the onset of CMV viraemia was associated with higher peak viral loads (5685 copies/ml versus 875 copies/ml; p = 0.002). Hence, QuantiFERON-CMV® testing in the week following CMV viremia can be useful in identifying HSCT recipients at risk of complicated reactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2035849515,"Mitochondria are essential organelles that harbor a reduced genome, and expression of that genome requires regulated metabolism of its transcriptome by nuclear-encoded proteins. Despite extensive investigation, a comprehensive map of the yeast mitochondrial transcriptome has not been developed and all of the RNA-metabolizing proteins have not been identified, both of which are prerequisites to elucidating the basic RNA biology of mitochondria. Here, we present a mitochondrial transcriptome map of the yeast S288C reference strain. Using RNAseq and bioinformatics, we show the expression level of all transcripts, revise all promoter, origin of replication, and tRNA annotations, and demonstrate for the first time the existence of alternative splicing, mirror RNAs, and a novel RNA processing site in yeast mitochondria. The transcriptome map has revealed new aspects of mitochondrial RNA biology and we expect it will serve as a valuable resource. As a complement to the map, we present our compilation of all known yeast nuclear-encoded ribonucleases (RNases), and a screen of this dataset for those that are imported into mitochondria. We sought to identify RNases that are refractory to recovery in traditional mitochondrial screens due to an essential function or eclipsed accumulation in another cellular compartment. Using this in silico approach, the essential RNase of the nuclear and cytoplasmic exosome, Dis3p, emerges as a strong candidate. Bioinformatics and in vivo analyses show that Dis3p has a conserved and functional mitochondrial-targeting signal (MTS). A clean and marker-less chromosomal deletion of the Dis3p MTS results in a defect in the decay of intron and mirror RNAs, thus revealing a role for Dis3p in mitochondrial RNA decay."
https://openalex.org/W1970280049,"PHLPP1 (PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase 1) is a protein-serine/threonine phosphatase and a negative regulator of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. Although its function as a suppressor of tumor cell growth has been established, the mechanism of its regulation is not completely understood. In this study, by utilizing the tandem affinity purification approach we have identified WDR48 and USP12 as novel PHLPP1-associated proteins. The WDR48·USP12 complex deubiquitinates PHLPP1 and thereby enhances its protein stability. Similar to PHLPP1 function, WDR48 and USP12 negatively regulate Akt activation and thus promote cellular apoptosis. Functionally, we show that WDR48 and USP12 suppress proliferation of tumor cells. Importantly, we found a WDR48 somatic mutation (L580F) that is defective in stabilizing PHLPP1 in colorectal cancers, supporting a WDR48 role in tumor suppression. Together, our results reveal WDR48 and USP12 as novel PHLPP1 regulators and potential suppressors of tumor cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W1998484183,"Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant hereditary neuromuscular disorder linked to the deletion of an integral number of 3.3-kb-long macrosatellite repeats (D4Z4) within the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q. Most genes identified in this region are overexpressed in FSHD myoblasts, including the double homeobox genes DUX4 and DUX4c. We have carried out a simultaneous miRNome/transcriptome analysis of FSHD and control primary myoblasts. Of 365 microRNAs (miRNAs) analyzed in this study, 29 were found to be differentially expressed between FSHD and normal myoblasts. Twenty-one microRNAs (miR-1, miR-7, miR-15a, miR-22, miR-30e, miR-32, miR-107, miR-133a, miR-133b, miR-139, miR-152, miR-206, miR-223, miR-302b, miR-331, miR-362, miR-365, miR-382, miR-496, miR-532, miR-654, and miR-660) were up-regulated, and eight were down-regulated (miR-15b, miR-20b, miR-21, miR-25, miR-100, miR-155, miR-345, and miR-594). Twelve of the miRNAs up-regulated in FHSD were also up-regulated in the cells ectopically expressing DUX4c, suggesting that this gene could regulate miRNA gene transcription. The myogenic miRNAs miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b, and miR-206 were highly expressed in FSHD myoblasts, which nonetheless did not prematurely enter myogenic differentiation. This could be accounted for by the fact that in FSHD myoblasts, functionally important target genes, including cell cycle, DNA damage, and ubiquitination-related genes, escape myogenic microRNA-induced repression."
https://openalex.org/W2168928144,"School surveys provide an operational approach to assess malaria transmission through parasite prevalence. There is limited evidence on the comparability of prevalence estimates obtained from school and community surveys carried out at the same locality.Concurrent school and community cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 46 school/community clusters in the western Kenyan highlands and households of school children were geolocated. Malaria was assessed by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and combined seroprevalence of antibodies to bloodstage Plasmodium falciparum antigens.RDT prevalence in school and community populations was 25.7% (95% CI: 24.4-26.8) and 15.5% (95% CI: 14.4-16.7), respectively. Seroprevalence in the school and community populations was 51.9% (95% CI: 50.5-53.3) and 51.5% (95% CI: 49.5-52.9), respectively. RDT prevalence in schools could differentiate between low (<7%, 95% CI: 0-19%) and high (>39%, 95% CI: 25-49%) transmission areas in the community and, after a simple adjustment, were concordant with the community estimates.Estimates of malaria prevalence from school surveys were consistently higher than those from community surveys and were strongly correlated. School-based estimates can be used as a reliable indicator of malaria transmission intensity in the wider community and may provide a basis for identifying priority areas for malaria control."
https://openalex.org/W3045792355,"The p53 tumour suppressor protein is a transcription factor that prevents oncogenic progression by activating the expression of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest genes in stressed cells. The stability of p53 is tightly regulated by ubiquitin-dependent degradation, driven mainly by its negative regulators ubiquitin ligase MDM2.In this study, we have identified OTUD5 as a DUB that interacts with and deubiquitinates p53. OTUD5 forms a direct complex with p53 and controls level of ubiquitination. The function of OTUD5 is required to allow the rapid activation of p53-dependent transcription and a p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage stress.As a novel deubiquitinating enzyme for p53, OTUD5 is required for the stabilization and the activation of a p53 response."
https://openalex.org/W2050642571,"Th17 cells are important effectors of immunity to extracellular pathogens, particularly at mucosal surfaces, but they can also contribute to pathologic tissue inflammation and autoimmunity. Defining the multitude of factors that influence their development is therefore of paramount importance. Our previous studies using Ikaros(-/-) CD4+ T cells implicated Ikaros in Th1 versus Th2 lineage decisions. Here we demonstrate that Ikaros also regulates Th17 differentiation through its ability to promote expression of multiple Th17 lineage-determining genes, including Ahr, Runx1, Rorc, Il17a, and Il22. Ikaros exerts its influence on the chromatin remodeling of these loci at two distinct stages in CD4+ T helper cell development. In naive cells, Ikaros is required to limit repressive chromatin modifications at these gene loci, thus maintaining the potential for expression of the Th17 gene program. Subsequently, Ikaros is essential for the acquisition of permissive histone marks in response to Th17 polarizing signals. Additionally, Ikaros represses the expression of genes that limit Th17 development, including Foxp3 and Tbx21. These data define new targets of the action of Ikaros and indicate that Ikaros plays a critical role in CD4+ T cell differentiation by integrating specific cytokine cues and directing epigenetic modifications that facilitate activation or repression of relevant genes that drive T cell lineage choice."
https://openalex.org/W2075218986,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) alleles carrying one point mutation that confers resistance to herbicides have been identified in arable grass weed populations where resistance has evolved under the selective pressure of herbicides. In an effort to determine whether herbicide resistance evolves from newly arisen mutations or from standing genetic variation in weed populations, we used herbarium specimens of the grass weed Alopecurus myosuroides to seek mutant ACCase alleles carrying an isoleucine-to-leucine substitution at codon 1781 that endows herbicide resistance. These specimens had been collected between 1788 and 1975, i.e., prior to the commercial release of herbicides inhibiting ACCase. Among the 734 specimens investigated, 685 yielded DNA suitable for PCR. Genotyping the ACCase locus using the derived Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (dCAPS) technique identified one heterozygous mutant specimen that had been collected in 1888. Occurrence of a mutant codon encoding a leucine residue at codon 1781 at the heterozygous state was confirmed in this specimen by sequencing, clearly demonstrating that resistance to herbicides can pre-date herbicides in weeds. We conclude that point mutations endowing resistance to herbicides without having associated deleterious pleiotropic effects can be present in weed populations as part of their standing genetic variation, in frequencies higher than the mutation frequency, thereby facilitating their subsequent selection by herbicide applications."
https://openalex.org/W2006024173,"Ras association domain family protein 1A (RASSF1A) is a tumor suppressor gene silenced in cancer. Here we report that RASSF1A is a novel regulator of intestinal inflammation as Rassf1a+/−, Rassf1a−/− and an intestinal epithelial cell specific knockout mouse (Rassf1a IEC-KO) rapidly became sick following dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) administration, a chemical inducer of colitis. Rassf1a knockout mice displayed clinical symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease including: increased intestinal permeability, enhanced cytokine/chemokine production, elevated nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells (NFκB) activity, elevated colonic cell death and epithelial cell injury. Furthermore, epithelial restitution/repair was inhibited in DSS-treated Rassf1a−/− mice with reduction of several makers of proliferation including Yes associated protein (YAP)-driven proliferation. Surprisingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of YAP was detected which coincided with increased nuclear p73 association, Bax-driven epithelial cell death and p53 accumulation resulting in enhanced apoptosis and poor survival of DSS-treated Rassf1a knockout mice. We can inhibit these events and promote the survival of DSS-treated Rassf1a knockout mice with intraperitoneal injection of the c-Abl and c-Abl related protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib/gleevec. However, p53 accumulation was not inhibited by imatinib/gleevec in the Rassf1a−/− background which revealed the importance of p53-dependent cell death during intestinal inflammation. These observations suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of YAP (to drive p73 association and up-regulation of pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax) and accumulation of p53 are consequences of inflammation-induced injury in DSS-treated Rassf1a−/− mice. Mechanistically, we can detect robust associations of RASSF1A with membrane proximal Toll-like receptor (TLR) components to suggest that RASSF1A may function to interfere and restrict TLR-driven activation of NFκB. Failure to restrict NFκB resulted in the inflammation-induced DNA damage driven tyrosine phosphorylation of YAP, subsequent p53 accumulation and loss of intestinal epithelial homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2135505914,"A number of databases have been developed to collect disease-related molecular, phenotypic and environmental features (DR-MPEs), such as genes, non-coding RNAs, genetic variations, drugs, phenotypes and environmental factors. However, each of current databases focused on only one or two DR-MPEs. There is an urgent demand to develop an integrated database, which can establish semantic associations among disease-related databases and link them to provide a global view of human disease at the biological level. This database, once developed, will facilitate researchers to query various DR-MPEs through disease, and investigate disease mechanisms from different types of data.To establish an integrated disease-associated database, disease vocabularies used in different databases are mapped to Disease Ontology (DO) through semantic match. 4,284 and 4,186 disease terms from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) respectively are mapped to DO. Then, the relationships between DR-MPEs and diseases are extracted and merged from different source databases for reducing the data redundancy.A semantically integrated disease-associated database (SIDD) is developed, which integrates 18 disease-associated databases, for researchers to browse multiple types of DR-MPEs in a view. A web interface allows easy navigation for querying information through browsing a disease ontology tree or searching a disease term. Furthermore, a network visualization tool using Cytoscape Web plugin has been implemented in SIDD. It enhances the SIDD usage when viewing the relationships between diseases and DR-MPEs. The current version of SIDD (Jul 2013) documents 4,465,131 entries relating to 139,365 DR-MPEs, and to 3,824 human diseases. The database can be freely accessed from: http://mlg.hit.edu.cn/SIDD."
https://openalex.org/W2067388000,"Dermaseptin S9 (Drs S9) is an atypical cationic antimicrobial peptide with a long hydrophobic core and with a propensity to form amyloid-like fibrils. Here we investigated its membrane interaction using a variety of biophysical techniques. Rather surprisingly, we found that Drs S9 induces efficient permeabilisation in zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles, but not in anionic phosphatidylglycerol (PG) vesicles. We also found that the peptide inserts more efficiently in PC than in PG monolayers. Therefore, electrostatic interactions between the cationic Drs S9 and anionic membranes cannot explain the selectivity of the peptide towards bacterial membranes. CD spectroscopy, electron microscopy and ThT fluorescence experiments showed that the peptide adopts slightly more β-sheet and has a higher tendency to form amyloid-like fibrils in the presence of PC membranes as compared to PG membranes. Thus, induction of leakage may be related to peptide aggregation. The use of a pre-incorporation protocol to reduce peptide/peptide interactions characteristic of aggregates in solution resulted in more α-helix formation and a more pronounced effect on the cooperativity of the gel-fluid lipid phase transition in all lipid systems tested. Calorimetric data together with 2H- and 31P-NMR experiments indicated that the peptide has a significant impact on the dynamic organization of lipid bilayers, albeit slightly less for zwitterionic than for anionic membranes. Taken together, our data suggest that in particular in membranes of zwitterionic lipids the peptide binds in an aggregated state resulting in membrane leakage. We propose that also the antimicrobial activity of Drs S9 may be a result of binding of the peptide in an aggregated state, but that specific binding and aggregation to bacterial membranes is regulated not by anionic lipids but by as yet unknown factors."
https://openalex.org/W2121463055,"Introduction In obese subjects, the relative reduction of the skeletal muscle strength, the reduced cardio-pulmonary capacity and tolerance to effort, the higher metabolic costs and, therefore, the increased inefficiency of gait together with the increased prevalence of co-morbid conditions might interfere with walking. Performance tests, such as the six-minute walking test (6MWT), can unveil the limitations in cardio-respiratory and motor functions underlying the obesity-related disability. Therefore the aims of the present study were: to explore the determinants of the 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) and to investigate the predictors of interruption of the walk test in obese subjects. Methods Obese patients [body mass index (BMI)>40 kg/m2] were recruited from January 2009 to December 2011. Anthropometry, body composition, specific questionnaire for Obesity-related Disabilities (TSD-OC test), fitness status and 6MWT data were evaluated. The correlation between the 6MWD and the potential independent variables (anthropometric parameters, body composition, muscle strength, flexibility and disability) were analysed. The variables which were singularly correlated with the response variable were included in a multivariated regression model. Finally, the correlation between nutritional and functional parameters and test interruption was investigated. Results 354 subjects (87 males, mean age 48.5±14 years, 267 females, mean age 49.8±15 years) were enrolled in the study. Age, weight, height, BMI, fat mass and fat free mass indexes, handgrip strength and disability were significantly correlated with the 6MWD and considered in the multivariate analysis. The determination coefficient of the regression analysis ranged from 0.21 to 0.47 for the different models. Body weight, BMI, waist circumference, TSD-OC test score and flexibility were found to be predictors of the 6MWT interruption. Discussion The present study demonstrated the impact of disability in obese subjects, together with age, anthropometric data, body composition and strength, on the 6-minute walking distance."
https://openalex.org/W2089607246,"There is a considerable lack of information concerning marine invertebrate sensitivity to sound exposure. However, recent findings on cuttlefish and octopi showed that exposure to artificial noise had a direct consequence on the functionality and physiology of the statocysts, sensory organs, which are responsible for their equilibrium and movements in the water column. Owing to a lack of available data on deep diving cephalopod species, we conducted a noise exposure comparative experiment on one Mediterranean squid, Illex coindetii, and on the European squid Loligo vulgaris. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed similar injuries in the inner structure of the statocysts, as those found in cuttlefish and octopi. In addition to the ultrastructural description of the lesions, we publish here the first images of the crista-cupula system and inner statocyst cavity of I. coindetii."
https://openalex.org/W2146215358,"In many animals, processes occurring in one season carry over to influence reproductive success and survival in future seasons. The strength of such carry-over effects is unlikely to be uniform across years, yet our understanding of the processes that are capable of modifying their strength remains limited. Here we show that female light-bellied Brent geese with higher body mass prior to spring migration successfully reared more offspring during breeding, but only in years where environmental conditions during breeding were favourable. In years of bad weather during breeding, all birds suffered reduced reproductive output irrespective of pre-migration mass. Our results suggest that the magnitude of reproductive benefits gained by maximising body stores to fuel breeding fluctuates markedly among years in concert with conditions during the breeding season, as does the degree to which carry-over effects are capable of driving variance in reproductive success among individuals. Therefore while carry-over effects have considerable power to drive fitness asymmetries among individuals, our ability to interpret these effects in terms of their implications for population dynamics is dependent on knowledge of fitness determinants occurring in subsequent seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2164906177,"Background The world’s first reported patient infected with avian influenza H7N9 was treated at the Fifth People’s Hospital of Shanghai. Shortly thereafter, several other cases emerged in the local area. Here, we describe the detailed epidemiological and clinical data of 6 cases of avian influenza H7N9. Methods and Findings We analyzed the epidemiologic and clinical data from clustered patients infected with H7N9 in the Minhang District of Shanghai during a 2-week period. Of the 6 patients, 2 were from a single family. In addition, 3 patients had a history of contact with poultry; however, all 6 patients lived in the proximity of 2 food markets where the H7N9 virus was detected in chickens and pigeons. The main symptoms were fever, cough, and hemoptysis. At onset, a decreased lymphocyte count and elevated creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein levels were observed. As the disease progressed, most patients developed dyspnea and hypoxemia. Imaging studies revealed lung consolidation and multiple ground-glass opacities in the early stage, rapidly extending bilaterally. All patients were treated with oseltamivir tablets beginning on days 3–8 after onset. The main complications were as follows: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; 83.3%), secondary bacterial infection (66.7%), pleural effusion (50%), left ventricular failure (33.3%), neuropsychiatric symptoms (33.3%), and rhabdomyolysis (16.7%). Of the 6 patients, 4 died of ARDS, with 2 patients recovering from the infection. Conclusions An outbreak of H7N9 infection occurred in the Minhang District of Shanghai that easily progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Two cases showed family aggregation, which led us to identify the H7N9 virus and indicated that human transmission may be involved in the spread of this infection."

Multivariate Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between serum cortisol level and occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction.Cognitive dysfunction occurred in 39.8% (66 of 166) of patients seven days after surgery. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that high serum cortisol level was significantly associated with the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (odds ratio [OR] 2.603, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.371-4.944, P = 0.003). Other independent predictors of early postoperative cognitive dysfunction included high preoperative New York Heart Association functional class (OR 0.402, 95% CI 0.207-0.782, P = 0.007), poor preoperative Grooved Pegboard test score of nondominant hand (OR 1.022, 95% CI 1.003-1.040, P = 0.020), use of penehyclidine as premedication (OR 2.565, 95% CI 1.109-5.933, P = 0.028), and occurrence of complications within seven days after surgery (OR 2.677, 95% CI 1.201-5.963, P = 0.016).High serum cortisol level in the first postoperative morning was associated with increased risk of cognitive dysfunction seven days after coronary artery bypass graft surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2049845594,"The Notch signaling pathway is involved in liver development and regeneration. Here, we investigate the role of the 4 mammalian Notch paralogs in the regulation of hepatoblast proliferation and hepatocytic differentiation. Our model is based on bipotential mouse embryonic liver (BMEL) progenitors that can differentiate into hepatocytes or cholangiocytes in vitro and in vivo. BMEL cells were subjected to Notch antagonists or agonists. Blocking Notch activation with a γ-secretase inhibitor, at 50 μM for 48 h, reduced cell growth by 50%. S-phase entry was impaired, but no apoptosis was induced. A systematic paralog-specific strategy was set using lentiviral transduction with constitutively active forms of each Notch receptor along with inhibition of endogenous Notch signaling. This assay demonstrates that proliferation of BMEL cells requires Notch2 and Notch4 activity, resulting in significant down-regulation of p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Conversely, Notch3-expressing cells proliferate less and express 3-fold higher levels of p57Kip2. The Notch3 cells present a hepatocyte-like morphology, enhanced multinucleation, and a ploidy shift. Moreover, Notch3 activity is conducive to hepatocytic differentiation in vitro, while its paralogs impede this fate. Our study provides the first evidence of a functional diversity among the mammalian Notch homologues in the proliferation and hepatocytic-lineage commitment of liver progenitors.—Ortica, S., Tarantino, N., Aulner, N., Israël, A., Gupta-Rossi, N.

https://openalex.org/W1981407066,"Single domain antibodies (sdAbs) are the recombinantly-expressed variable domain from camelid (or shark) heavy chain only antibodies and provide rugged recognition elements. Many sdAbs possess excellent affinity and specificity; most refold and are able to bind antigen after thermal denaturation. The sdAb A3, specific for the toxin Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), shows both sub-nanomolar affinity for its cognate antigen (0.14 nM) and an unusually high melting point of 85°C. Understanding the source of sdAb A3’s high melting temperature could provide a route for engineering improved melting temperatures into other sdAbs. The goal of this work was to determine how much of sdAb A3’s stability is derived from its complementarity determining regions (CDRs) versus its framework. Towards answering this question we constructed a series of CDR swap mutants in which the CDRs from unrelated sdAbs were integrated into A3’s framework and where A3’s CDRs were integrated into the framework of the other sdAbs. All three CDRs from A3 were moved to the frameworks of sdAb D1 (a ricin binder that melts at 50°C) and the anti-ricin sdAb C8 (melting point of 60°C). Similarly, the CDRs from sdAb D1 and sdAb C8 were moved to the sdAb A3 framework. In addition individual CDRs of sdAb A3 and sdAb D1 were swapped. Melting temperature and binding ability were assessed for each of the CDR-exchange mutants. This work showed that CDR2 plays a critical role in sdAb A3’s binding and stability. Overall, results from the CDR swaps indicate CDR interactions play a major role in the protein stability."
https://openalex.org/W2078050666,"Patients presenting with painless hematuria form a large part of the urological patient population. In many cases, especially in younger patients, the cause of hematuria is harmless. Nonetheless, hematuria could be a symptom of malignant disease and hence most patients will be subject to cystoscopy. In this study, we aimed to develop a prediction model based on methylation markers in combination with clinical variables, in order to stratify patients with high risk for bladder cancer.Patients (n=169) presenting with painless hematuria were included. 54 patients were diagnosed with bladder cancer. In the remaining 115 patients, the cause of hematuria was non-malignant. Urine samples were collected prior to cystoscopy. Urine DNA was analyzed for methylation of OSR1, SIM2, OTX1, MEIS1 and ONECUT2. Methylation percentages were calculated and were combined with clinical variables into a logistic regression model.Logistic regression analysis based on the five methylation markers, age, gender and type of hematuria resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 and an optimism corrected AUC of 0.84 after internal validation by bootstrapping. Using a cut-off value of 0.307 allowed stratification of patients in a low-risk and high-risk group, resulting in a sensitivity of 82% (44/54) and a specificity of 82% (94/115). Most aggressive tumors were found in patients in the high-risk group. The addition of cytology to the prediction model, improved the AUC from 0.88 to 0.89, with a sensitivity and specificity of 85% (39/46) and 87% (80/92), retrospectively.This newly developed prediction model could be a helpful tool in risk stratification of patients presenting with painless hematuria. Accurate risk prediction might result in less extensive examination of low risk patients and thereby, reducing patient burden and costs. Further validation in a large prospective patient cohort is necessary to prove the true clinical value of this model."

This study used molecular fingerprinting, multilocus DNA sequence data, conidial morphology, host range tests and scanning electron microscopy to investigate the relationship between Rhynchosporium species on ryegrasses, both economically important forage grasses and common wild grasses in many cereal growing areas, and other plant species. Two different types of Rhynchosporium were found on ryegrasses in the UK. Firstly, there were isolates of R. commune that were pathogenic to both barley and Italian ryegrass. Secondly, there were isolates of a new species, here named R. lolii, that were pathogenic only to ryegrass species. R. lolii was most closely related to R. orthosporum, but exhibited clear molecular, morphological and host range differences. The species was estimated to have diverged from R. orthosporum ca. 5735 years before the present. The colonisation strategy of all of the different Rhynchosporium species involved extensive hyphal growth in the sub-cuticular regions of the leaves. Finally, new species-specific PCR diagnostic tests were developed that could distinguish between these five closely related Rhynchosporium species."
https://openalex.org/W2081447681,"Members of the kinesin superfamily of molecular motors differ in several key structural domains, which probably allows these molecular motors to serve the different physiologies required of them. One of the most variable of these is a stem-loop motif referred to as L5. This loop is longest in the mitotic kinesin Eg5, and previous structural studies have shown that it can assume different conformations in different nucleotide states. However, enzymatic domains often consist of a mixture of conformations whose distribution shifts in response to substrate binding or product release, and this information is not available from the ""static"" images that structural studies provide. We have addressed this issue in the case of Eg5 by attaching a fluorescent probe to L5 and examining its fluorescence, using both steady state and time-resolved methods. This reveals that L5 assumes an equilibrium mixture of three orientations that differ in their local environment and segmental mobility. Combining these studies with transient state kinetics demonstrates that there is a major shift in this distribution during transitions that interconvert weak and strong microtubule binding states. Finally, in conjunction with previous cryo-EM reconstructions of Eg5·microtubule complexes, these fluorescence studies suggest a model in which L5 regulates both nucleotide and microtubule binding through a set of reversible interactions with helix α3. We propose that these features facilitate the production of sustained opposing force by Eg5, which underlies its role in supporting formation of a bipolar spindle in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2162594566,"mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) is a commonly used technique to survey gene expression from organisms with fully sequenced genomes. Successful mRNA-seq requires purification of mRNA away from the much more abundant ribosomal RNA, which is typically accomplished by oligo-dT selection. However, mRNAs with short poly-A tails are captured poorly by oligo-dT based methods. We demonstrate that combining mRNA capture via oligo-dT with mRNA capture by the 5’ 7-methyl guanosine cap provides a more complete view of the transcriptome and can be used to assay changes in mRNA poly-A tail length on a genome-wide scale. We also show that using mRNA-seq reads from both capture methods as input for de novo assemblers provides a more complete reconstruction of the transcriptome than either method used alone. We apply these methods of mRNA capture and de novo assembly to the transcriptome of Xenopus laevis, a well-studied frog that currently lacks a finished sequenced genome, to discover transcript sequences for thousands of mRNAs that are currently absent from public databases. The methods we describe here will be broadly applicable to many organisms and will provide insight into the transcriptomes of organisms with sequenced and unsequenced genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2058105099,"Leishmania infantum infection in humans and dogs can evolve with a wide range of clinical presentations, varying from asymptomatic infections to visceral leishmaniasis. We hypothesized that the immune response elicited by L. infantum infection could modulate whether the host will remain asymptomatic or progress to disease. A total of 44 dogs naturally infected with L. infantum were studied. Leishmania burden was estimated in the blood and spleen by qPCR. The expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-10 and Iron Regulatory Protein 2 (IRP2) were determined in the spleen by quantitative PCR. Sera cytokines were evaluated by ELISA. Dogs were grouped in quartiles according parasite burden. Increased expression of IFN-γ and TNF-α was associated with reduced Leishmania burden, whereas increased IL-10 and IRP2 expressions were associated with higher Leishmania load. Increased plasma albumin and IFN-γ expression explained 22.8% of the decrease in parasite burden in the spleen. These data confirm that lower IFN-γ response and higher IL-10 correlated with increased parasite load and severity of the visceral leishmaniasis in dogs. The balance between the branches of immune response and the intracellular iron availability could determine, in part, the course of Leishmania infection."

These pathogens use a type III secretion system to inject virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells, some of which inhibit the innate immune system. The enterohemorrhagic E. coli NleH1 effector prevents the nuclear translocation of RPS3 (ribosomal protein S3) to inhibit its participation as a nuclear “specifier” of NF-κB binding to target gene promoters. NleH1 binds to RPS3 and inhibits its phosphorylation on Ser-209 by IκB kinase-β (IKKβ). However, the precise mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. NleH1 possesses a Ser/Thr protein kinase activity that is essential both for its ability to inhibit the RPS3/NF-κB pathway and for full virulence of the attaching/effacing mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. However, neither RPS3 nor IKKβ is a substrate of NleH1 kinase activity. We therefore screened ∼9,000 human proteins to identify NleH1 kinase substrates and identified CRKL (v-Crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene-like protein), a substrate of the BCR/ABL kinase.

As a result, we cannot decipher, at the molecular level, how the proteolytic activity of B. fragilis tailors the normal luminal epithelium for inflammation and disease onset. Understanding the substrate cleavage specificity of MPII relative to FRAs may help to determine how infection-associated inflammation enhances carcinogenesis in the affected organs and how we may find a means to fight the disease. Here, we performed a comparative characterization of MPII and FRA3, a representative of the FRA isoforms. Our data imply that, in contrast with the FRA family members, the unconventional MPII cleavage preferences mimic those of furin-like proprotein convertases. To the best of our knowledge, MPII is the first zinc metalloproteinase with the dibasic cleavage preferences, suggesting a high level of versatility of metalloproteinase proteolysis. Based on our results, we suggest that the combined (rather than individual) activity of MPII and FRAs is required for B. fragilis virulence. The reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless indicated otherwise. 5-FAM-SLGRKIQIQK(QXL520)-NH2 fluorescence-quenched peptide substrate was acquired from AnaSpec.

The frozen tumor and matching normal tissue deidentified biopsies were obtained from our preexisting collection of proximal CRC cancer specimens. Genomic DNA was extracted from the tissue samples using the DNeasy blood and tissue DNA purification system (Qiagen). The 501-bp fragment of the B. fragilis 16 S rRNA gene was amplified in the 100-μl PCRs containing genomic DNA (100 ng), the forward and reverse primers (5′-ATAGCCTTTCGAAAGRAAGAT-3′ and 5′-CCAGTATCAACTGCAATTTTA-3, respectively; 0.3 μm each), Crimson Taq DNA polymerase (1 unit), and 12.5 mm Tricine buffer, pH 8.5, supplemented with 42.5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 6% dextran, and 0.2 mm dNTP mix. DNA amplifications were performed using denaturing of the samples at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 PCR amplifications (95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min). The products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplified 501-bp products were purified and sequenced to confirm their authenticity and identity. Two-sided Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the statistical significance of the association of the bacteria with colorectal cancer. The full-length cDNA coding for the wild type MPII proenzyme (gi:3046922) and the FRA3 proenzyme (PDB accession code 3P24; gi:315583580) were synthesized by Genewiz. PCR with the 5′-CACCATGCACCATCACCATCACCATGGAGCCTGTGCCGATGACCTG-3′ and 5′-TCAATGGTGGTGATGGTGGTGCTTGTCATCGTCATCTTTGTAGTCCTTTTGGATGCACTCCAG-3′ oligonucleotides as the forward and reverse primers, respectively, was then used to insert the His6 tags (both N- and C-terminally) and the FLAG tag (C-terminally) into the MPII template. Similarly, the 5′-CACCATGCACCATCACCATCACCATGGAGCCTGCAGCAATGAGGCC-3′ and 5′-TCAATGGTGGTGATGGTGGTGCTTGTCATCGTCATCTTTGTAGTCACCATCTGCGATCTCCCAGCC-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively, were used to incorporate two His6 tags and a single FLAG tag into the FRA3 construct. The MPII E352A proteolytically inactive mutant, in which Ala replaced the catalytically essential Glu residue of the active site, was constructed using PCR mutagenesis with 5′-CCGTATACACTGGCACACGCGATCGGCCATCTGCTGGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCCAGCAGATGGCCGATCGCGTGTGCCAGTGTATACGG-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively, and the wild type MPII template (mutant nucleotides are underlined). Similarly, 5′-GATGGCCCACGCACTGGGCCACATC-3′ and 5′-GATGTGGCCCAGTGCGTGGGCCATC-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively, and the wild type FRA3 template were used to generate the FRA3 E349A inactive mutant (mutant nucleotides are underlined). The authenticity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild type and mutant tagged constructs were recloned into the pET101 expression vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant pET101 plasmids were used to transform competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus cells (Stratagene). Transformed cells were grown at 30 °C in LB broth containing ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml). Cultures were induced with 0.6 mm IPTG for 16 h at 18 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 m NaCl, and disrupted by sonication. The pellet was removed by centrifugation (40,000 × g; 30 min). The constructs were then purified from the supernatant fraction on a Co2+-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, supplemented with 1 m NaCl. After washing out the impurities using the same buffer supplemented with 35 mm imidazole, the bound material was eluted using a 35–500 mm gradient of imidazole. The FRA fractions were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. The purified material was kept at −80 °C until use. The purity of the material was tested by SDS-gel electrophoresis (12% NuPAGE-MOPS, Invitrogen) followed by Coomassie staining and by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG tag antibody. The MPII E352A and FRA3 constructs (3 μg; 3 μm each) were co-incubated in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of trypsin. Similarly, FRA3 (3 μg; 3 μm) was co-incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with increasing concentrations of active MPII in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 50 μm ZnCl2. The cleavage was stopped by adding a 5× SDS sample buffer to the reactions. The digested samples were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis in 12% NuPAGE-MOPS gels. Peptide pool preparation and the following in vitro cleavage assays were performed using a methodology similar to those described in our recent publications (36Kozlov I.A. Thomsen E.R. Munchel S.E.

Template DNA encoding 10-amino acid residue-long peptide substrates was transcribed in vitro to produce the corresponding mRNAs. In vitro translation was then used to generate peptides covalently attached to their mRNA templates (39Roberts R.W. Szostak J.W. RNA-peptide fusions for the in vitro selection of peptides and proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 12297-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). To increase their stability, the peptide-mRNA fusions were converted to the corresponding covalent peptide-cDNA fusions (40Kurz M. Gu K. Al-Gawari A. Lohse P.A. cDNA-protein fusions. Covalent protein-gene conjugates for the in vitro selection of peptides and proteins.Chembiochem. 2001; 2: 666-672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The peptide-cDNA fusions were biotinylated at the N terminus and immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. We also spiked six biotinylated oligonucleotides into the peptide-cDNA pool to use as internal standards for normalization after PCRs. The magnetic beads with the immobilized peptide-cDNA pool (2 pmol) were co-incubated with MPII and FRA3 (1.2 or 12 pmol) at 37 °C for 30 min in 3-μl reactions containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 10 mm CaCl2, and 10 μm ZnCl2. Reactions without the proteinases were used as negative controls. To identify cleaved peptide substrates, the cDNA molecules released by the proteinase treatment were collected, the DNA adapters required for sequencing were installed by PCR (41Bentley D.R.

In this study, we produced and tested 316 peptide sequences. Peptide abundance in solution was quantified by counts of DNA reads corresponding to each peptide sequence. The cleavage efficiencies were determined by comparing counts in the proteinase-treated samples versus proteinase-less, buffer-only controls (each in triplicate). Next, we normalized the data for each of six different biotinylated substrates (internal standard) across the whole data set. In order to calculate an enrichment ratio for each substrate, we considered counts (in triplicate) in a positive sample over the average of counts of a control sample (buffer-only, no proteinase) + 3 × S.D. An enrichment ratio (ER) = 1 indicates that counts in a positive sample are 3 × S.D. values above the “buffer-only, no proteinase” negative sample. Eleven 10-residue long peptides (GHSRRSRRSG, AGLRRAALGG, AGLRRASLGG, LRRKRSLSYS, GRHRRQIDRG, GNKRRGGTAG, SGHMHAALTA, SGPVSMRYTA, SGPRSLKSTA, SGPMSLRMTA, and PTKIYDNIYD) were synthesized by the Spyder Institute (Prague, Czech Republic). The peptides (1 μg; 50 μm each) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the MPII or FRA3 (0.4 μg; 0.5 μm) in 20 μl of 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm ZnCl2. The molecular mass of the intact peptides and the digest products was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis using an Autoflex II mass spectrometer (Brucker Daltonics).

https://openalex.org/W2037584877,"Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) is a mouse genetic system that allows simultaneous gene knockout and fluorescent labeling of sparse, clonally-related cells within an otherwise normal mouse, thereby circumventing embryonic lethality problems and providing single-cell resolution for phenotypic analysis in vivo. The clonal efficiency of MADM is intrinsically low because it relies on Cre/loxP-mediated mitotic recombination between two homologous chromosomes rather than within the same chromosome, as in the case of conditional knockout (CKO). Although sparse labeling enhances in vivo resolution, the original MADM labels too few or even no cells when a low-expressing Cre transgene is used or a small population of cells is studied. Recently, we described the usage of a new system, MADM-ML, which contains three mutually exclusive, self-recognizing loxP variant sites as opposed to a single loxP site present in the original MADM system (referred to as MADM-SL in this paper). Here we carefully compared the recombination efficiency between MADM-SL and MADM-ML using the same Cre transgene, and found that the new system labels significantly more cells than the original system does. When we established mouse medulloblastoma models with both the original and the new MADM systems, we found that, while the MADM-SL model suffered from varied tumor progression and incomplete penetrance, the MADM-ML model had consistent tumor progression and full penetrance of tumor formation. Therefore MADM-ML, with its higher recombination efficiency, will broaden the applicability of MADM for studying many biological questions including normal development and disease modeling at cellular resolution in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2042985795,"DNA-binding proteins (DBPs), such as transcription factors, constitute about 10% of the protein-coding genes in eukaryotic genomes and play pivotal roles in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression by binding to short stretches of DNA. Despite their number and importance, only for a minor portion of DBPs the binding sequence had been disclosed. Methods that allow the de novo identification of DNA-binding motifs of known DBPs, such as protein binding microarray technology or SELEX, are not yet suited for high-throughput and automation. To close this gap, we report an automatable DNA-protein-interaction (DPI)-ELISA screen of an optimized double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) probe library that allows the high-throughput identification of hexanucleotide DNA-binding motifs. In contrast to other methods, this DPI-ELISA screen can be performed manually or with standard laboratory automation. Furthermore, output evaluation does not require extensive computational analysis to derive a binding consensus. We could show that the DPI-ELISA screen disclosed the full spectrum of binding preferences for a given DBP. As an example, AtWRKY11 was used to demonstrate that the automated DPI-ELISA screen revealed the entire range of in vitro binding preferences. In addition, protein extracts of AtbZIP63 and the DNA-binding domain of AtWRKY33 were analyzed, which led to a refinement of their known DNA-binding consensi. Finally, we performed a DPI-ELISA screen to disclose the DNA-binding consensus of a yet uncharacterized putative DBP, AtTIFY1. A palindromic TGATCA-consensus was uncovered and we could show that the GATC-core is compulsory for AtTIFY1 binding. This specific interaction between AtTIFY1 and its DNA-binding motif was confirmed by in vivo plant one-hybrid assays in protoplasts. Thus, the value and applicability of the DPI-ELISA screen for de novo binding site identification of DBPs, also under automatized conditions, is a promising approach for a deeper understanding of gene regulation in any organism of choice."
https://openalex.org/W2047452959,"Changes in body odor are known to be a consequence of many diseases. Much of the published work on disease-related and body odor changes has involved parasites and certain cancers. Much less studied have been viral diseases, possibly due to an absence of good animal model systems. Here we studied possible alteration of fecal odors in animals infected with avian influenza viruses (AIV). In a behavioral study, inbred C57BL/6 mice were trained in a standard Y-maze to discriminate odors emanating from feces collected from mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza virus compared to fecal odors from non-infected controls. Mice could discriminate odors from non-infected compared to infected individual ducks on the basis of fecal odors when feces from post-infection periods were paired with feces from pre-infection periods. Prompted by this indication of odor change, fecal samples were subjected to dynamic headspace and solvent extraction analyses employing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify chemical markers indicative of AIV infection. Chemical analyses indicated that AIV infection was associated with a marked increase of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) in feces. These experiments demonstrate that information regarding viral infection exists via volatile metabolites present in feces. Further, they suggest that odor changes following virus infection could play a role in regulating behavior of conspecifics exposed to infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2013310955,"The proform of the WF146 protease, an extracellular subtilase produced by thermophilic Bacillus sp. WF146, matures efficiently at high temperatures. Here we report that the proform, which contains an N-terminal propeptide composed of a core domain (N*) and a linker peptide, is intrinsically able to mature via multiple pathways. One autocatalytic pathway is initiated by cis-processing of N* to generate an autoprocessed complex N*-I(WT), and this step is followed by truncation of the linker peptide and degradation of N*. Another autocatalytic pathway is initiated by trans-processing of the linker peptide followed by degradation of N*. Unlike most reported subtilases, the maturation of the WF146 protease occurs not only autocatalytically but also hetero-catalytically whereby heterogeneous proteases accelerate the maturation of the WF146 protease via trans-processing of the proform and N*-I(WT). Although N* acts as an intramolecular chaperone and an inhibitor of the mature enzyme, the linker peptide is susceptible to proteolysis, allowing the trans-processing reaction to occur auto- and hetero-catalytically. These studies also demonstrate that the WF146 protease undergoes subtle structural adjustments during the maturation process and that the binding of Ca(2+) is required for routing the proform to mature properly at high temperatures. Interestingly, under Ca(2+)-free conditions, the proform is cis-processed into a unique propeptide-intermediate complex (N*-I(E)) capable of re-synthesis of the proform. Based on the basic catalytic principle of serine proteases and these experimental results, a mechanism for the cis-processing/re-synthesis equilibrium of the proform and the role of the linker peptide in regulation of this equilibrium has been proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1977136130,"Mounting effective innate and adaptive immune responses are critical for viral clearance and the generation of long lasting immunity. It is known that production of inhibitory factors may result in the inability of the host to clear viruses, resulting in chronic viral persistence. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) has been identified as a novel effector molecule of CD4(+)CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells that inhibits immune activity by binding to FCγRIIB expressed primarily on antigen presenting cells (APC). In this study, we show that infection of mice with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus WE (LCMV WE) leads to increased plasma levels of FGL2, which were detected as early as 2 days post-infection (pi) and persisted until day 50 pi. Mice deficient in FGL2 (fgl2(-/-)) had increased viral titers of LCMV WE in the liver early p.i but cleared the virus by day 12 similar to wild type mice. Dendritic cells (DC) isolated from the spleens of LCMV WE infected fgl2(-/-) had increased expression of the DC maturation markers CD80 and MHC Class II compared to wild type (fgl2(+/+)). Frequencies of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells producing IFNγ in response to ex vivo peptide re-stimulation isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes were also increased in LCMV WE infected fgl2(-/-) mice. Increased frequencies of CD8(+) T cells specific for LCMV tetramers GP33 and NP396 were detected within the liver of fgl2(-/-) mice. Plasma from fgl2(-/-) mice contained higher titers of total and neutralizing anti-LCMV antibody. Enhanced anti-viral immunity in fgl2(-/-) mice was associated with increased levels of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), hepatic necrosis and inflammation following LCMV WE infection. These data demonstrate that targeting FGL2 leads to early increased viral replication but enhanced anti-viral adaptive T & B cell responses. Targeting FGL2 may enhance the efficacy of current anti-viral therapies for hepatotropic viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2068136170,"Presenilins, the catalytic components of the γ-secretase complex, are upstream regulators of multiple cellular pathways via regulation of gene transcription. However, the underlying mechanisms and the genes regulated by these pathways are poorly characterized. In this study, we identify Tequila and its mammalian ortholog Prss12 as genes negatively regulated by presenilins in Drosophila larval brains and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, respectively. Prss12 encodes the serine protease neurotrypsin, which cleaves the heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin. Altered neurotrypsin activity causes serious synaptic and cognitive defects; despite this, the molecular processes regulating neurotrypsin expression and activity are poorly understood. Using γ-secretase drug inhibitors and presenilin mutants in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found that a mature γ-secretase complex was required to repress neurotrypsin expression and agrin cleavage. We also determined that PSEN1 endoproteolysis or processing of well known γ-secretase substrates was not essential for this process. At the transcriptional level, PSEN1/2 removal induced cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/CREB-binding protein binding, accumulation of activating histone marks at the neurotrypsin promoter, and neurotrypsin transcriptional and functional up-regulation that was dependent on GSK3 activity. Upon PSEN1/2 reintroduction, this active epigenetic state was replaced by a methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)-containing repressive state and reduced neurotrypsin expression. Genome-wide analysis revealed hundreds of other mouse promoters in which CREB binding is similarly modulated by the presence/absence of presenilins.

Ilagan M.X. γ-Secretase: proteasome of the membrane?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Generally, γ-secretase cleavage of transmembrane substrates results in the release of intracellular domains and small extracellular fragments. Both types of fragments can initiate a cascade of signaling events often culminating in regulation of transcription (3Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. γ-Secretase: proteasome of the membrane?.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Besides presenilin, there are three other γ-secretase components, nicastrin, anterior pharynx-defective 1 (Aph1), 4The abbreviations used are: Aph1anterior pharynx-defective 1PSENpresenilinCREBcyclic AMP response element-binding proteinCBPCREB-binding proteinSp1specificity protein 1GSK3glycogen synthase kinase 3P-S9-GSK3GSK3 phosphorylated at serine 9APPamyloid precursor proteinCTFC-terminal fragmentcadcadherinMeCP2methyl CpG-binding proteinMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastFADfamilial Alzheimer diseasePolpolymeraseRT-qPCRreal time quantitative PCRChIP-seqChIP coupled with next generation sequencingdKOdouble KOTeqTequilaAPLP2amyloid precursor-like protein 2H3histone 3me3trimethylationSEAsea urchin sperm protein, enterokinase, and agrinAPPLamyloid precursor protein-likeIWRinhibitor of Wnt responsePsnpresenilinTMtransmembranePrPprion proteinBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolhPSENhuman PSENTSStranscriptional start siteH3K9acacetylation of histone 3 at lysine 9H3K27acacetylation of histone 3 at lysine 27P-CREB-S129CREB phosphorylated at serine 129Agrnagrin. and presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen2), that are required to form a mature and active γ-secretase complex (1De Strooper B. Annaert W. Novel research horizons for presenilins and γ-secretases in cell biology and disease.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 235-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The prevalent idea for assembly of the complex is that Aph1 functions as a scaffold subunit and initiates a subcomplex together with nicastrin (5St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. Assembly of the presenilin γ-/ε-secretase complex.J. Neurochem. 2012; 120: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Nicastrin, which might contain the substrate recognition and binding site, promotes maturation and proper trafficking of the other γ-secretase components (5St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. Assembly of the presenilin γ-/ε-secretase complex.J. Neurochem. 2012; 120: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Subsequently, presenilin binds to the Aph1-Nicastrin subcomplex, and finally, incorporation of Pen2 to the complex appears to trigger autocatalytic endoproteolytic cleavage of the presenilins and therefore formation of a mature and active γ-secretase complex (5St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. Assembly of the presenilin γ-/ε-secretase complex.J. Neurochem. 2012; 120: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In mammals, the heterogeneity of the γ-secretase complex is achieved by the existence of two presenilins, presenilin-1 (PSEN1) and presenilin-2 (PSEN2), and two Aph1 forms (Aph1A and Aph1B), each being alternatively spliced (5St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. Assembly of the presenilin γ-/ε-secretase complex.J. Neurochem. 2012; 120: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Additionally and contributing to this heterogeneity, other non-core components (e.g. transmembrane trafficking protein, 21-KD TMP21 and γ-secretase-activating protein gSAP) interact with subsets of γ-secretase complexes and appear to differentially modulate their proteolytic activity over specific γ-secretase substrates (5St George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. Assembly of the presenilin γ-/ε-secretase complex.J.

Several signaling pathways regulated by γ-secretase activity involve the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). Specifically, γ-secretase-generated N-cadherin and E-cadherin intracellular domains (N-cad/CTF2 and E-cad/CTF2, respectively) can bind to and promote proteasomal degradation of the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), which presumably results in poor association with stimulated CREB and therefore reduced CREB-regulated transcription (6Marambaud P.

However, this regulatory mechanism must be more complex because inhibition rather than activation of CREB-dependent transcription has been observed in some presenilin-deficient systems (8Francis Y.I.

Loss of presenilin function causes impairments of memory and synaptic plasticity followed by age-dependent neurodegeneration.Neuron. 2004; 42: 23-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Similarly, the γ-secretase-generated amyloid β peptide, which is released from amyloid precursor protein (APP) after sequential processing by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase, may also impair CREB-dependent transcription via inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) and other kinases (10Vitolo O.V.

Amyloid β-peptide inhibition of the PKA/CREB pathway and long-term potentiation: reversibility by drugs that enhance cAMP signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Amyloid β has also been shown to inhibit CREB activity by decreasing intracellular calcium influx, which reduces phosphorylation of the CREB coactivator CRTC1 (12España J. Valero J.

Whereas a connection between presenilins and CREB signaling has been well established, the list of genes regulated by this connection has not been fully explored and is generally limited to the study of the c-Fos gene, a well known CREB target. In experiments to identify new presenilin-regulated genes, we discovered that Tequila (Teq) and its mammalian ortholog Prss12 are negatively regulated by presenilins in Drosophila larval brains and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), respectively. Prss12 encodes the serine protease neurotrypsin, which cleaves the heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin. Teq/neurotrypsin is of particular interest as a presenilin target given its likely role in memory and cognition. Specifically, Teq mutants in Drosophila have defects in memory formation, and neurotrypsin itself has been implicated in processing of agrin, which is an important synaptic component (14Didelot G. Molinari F. Tchénio P. Comas D. Milhiet E. Munnich A. Colleaux L. Preat T. Tequila, a neurotrypsin ortholog, regulates long-term memory formation in Drosophila.Science. 2006; 313: 851-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Reif R. Sales S. Hettwer S. Dreier B.

Specific cleavage of agrin by neurotrypsin, a synaptic protease linked to mental retardation.FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3468-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) Finally, neurotrypsin mutations in humans cause mental retardation (16Molinari F. Rio M. Meskenaite V. Encha-Razavi F. Augé J. Bacq D. Briault S. Vekemans M. Munnich A. Attié-Bitach T. Sonderegger P. Colleaux L. Truncating neurotrypsin mutation in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation.Science. 2002; 298: 1779-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, we found that in MEFs the presence of a mature γ-secretase complex, but not the autocatalytic endoproteolysis of PSEN1 or the processing of well known γ-secretase substrates, is required to repress neurotrypsin and agrin cleavage. At the chromatin level, we found that presenilins modulated the transcriptional and epigenetic state of the neurotrypsin promoter. Specifically, presenilins prevented CREB/CBP binding to the neurotrypsin promoter and induced a repressive epigenetic state characterized by binding of MeCP2 in some instances. Furthermore, we found that in Psen1/2 double KO (dKO) cells GSK3 activity was required to maintain high levels of neurotrypsin expression. Intriguingly, we identified hundreds of other promoters whose CREB occupation was also blocked by the presence of presenilins. Altogether, we have uncovered a novel strategy utilized by presenilins to regulate CREB-dependent transcription via suppression of CREB binding to specific promoters in the mouse genome. For Prss12/neurotrypsin, this regulatory process had direct effects on the biological activity of its encoded protein as measured by agrin cleavage.

In a genome-wide expression analysis (data not shown), we discovered that Teq might be a presenilin-dependent gene in Drosophila larval brains. Drosophila contains a single Psn gene as well as ortholog/homolog genes for each of the other core components of the γ-secretase complex (32Boulianne G.L. Livne-Bar I. Humphreys J.M. Liang Y. Lin C.

Isolation and characterization of Drosophila presenilin homolog.Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To test whether Teq expression is modulated by presenilin, we used larval brains carrying the loss-of-function presenilin mutant psn143 (see “Experimental Procedures”). These brains exhibit low Psn expression (Fig. 1A, left panel) and reduced γ-secretase activity as shown by robust accumulation of the APPL C-terminal fragments (Fig. 1A, right panel). RT-qPCR analysis revealed ∼3.5-fold Teq mRNA up-regulation compared with wild-type brains (Fig. 1B). Conversely, brains of Psn-overexpressing larvae (Fig. 1C, left panel) showed no changes in APPL CTF (Fig. 1C, right panel), and exhibited ∼45% Teq mRNA down-regulation when compared with control (Fig. 1D). Thus, presenilin is a negative regulator of Teq expression in vivo in Drosophila larval brains. The proposed mammalian ortholog of Teq is Prss12 (also known as neurotrypsin or motopsin (14Didelot G. Molinari F. Tchénio P. Comas D. Milhiet E. Munnich A. Colleaux L. Preat T.

https://openalex.org/W2001315745,"High-energy wavelengths in the ultraviolet-B (UVB, 280-315 nm) and the UVA (315-400-nm) portion of the spectrum are harmful to terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Interestingly, UVA is also involved in the repair of UV induced damage. Organisms living in shallow coral reef environments possess UV absorbing compounds, such as mycosporine-like amino acids, to protect them from UV radiation. While it has been demonstrated that exposure to UV (280-400 nm) affects the UV absorbance of fish mucus, whether the effects of UV exposure vary between UVB and UVA wavelengths is not known. Therefore, we investigated whether the UVB, UVA, or photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) portions of the spectrum affected the UV absorbance of epithelial mucus and Fulton’s body condition index of the cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus. We also compared field-measured UV absorbance with laboratory based high-performance liquid chromatography measurements of mycosporine-like amino acid concentrations. After 1 week, we found that the UV absorbance of epithelial mucus was higher in the UVB+UVA+PAR treatment compared with the UVA+PAR and PAR only treatments; after 2 and 3 weeks, however, differences between treatments were not detected. After 3 weeks, Fulton’s body condition index was lower for fish in the UVB+UVA+PAR compared with PAR and UVA+PAR treatments; furthermore, all experimentally treated fish had a lower Fulton’s body condition index than did freshly caught fish. Finally, we found a decrease with depth in the UV absorbance of mucus of wild-caught fish. This study suggests that the increase in UV absorbance of fish mucus in response to increased overall UV levels is a function of the UVB portion of the spectrum. This has important implications for the ability of cleaner fish and other fishes to adjust their mucus UV protection in response to variations in environmental UV exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2076421632,"UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH) provides precursors for steroid elimination, hyaluronan production, and glycosaminoglycan synthesis. The wild-type UGDH enzyme purifies in a hexamer-dimer equilibrium and transiently undergoes dynamic motion that exposes the dimer-dimer interface during catalysis. In the current study we created and characterized point mutations that yielded exclusively dimeric species (obligate dimer, T325D), dimeric species that could be induced to form hexamers in the ternary complex with substrate and cofactor (T325A), and a previously described exclusively hexameric species (UGDHΔ132) to investigate the role of quaternary structure in regulation of the enzyme. Characterization of the purified enzymes revealed a significant decrease in the enzymatic activity of the obligate dimer and hexamer mutants. Kinetic analysis of wild-type UGDH and the inducible hexamer, T325A, showed that upon increasing enzyme concentration, which favors the hexameric species, activity was modestly decreased and exhibited cooperativity. In contrast, cooperative kinetic behavior was not observed in the obligate dimer, T325D. These observations suggest that the regulation of the quaternary assembly of the enzyme is essential for optimal activity and allosteric regulation. Comparison of kinetic and thermal stability parameters revealed structurally dependent properties consistent with a role for controlled assembly and disassembly of the hexamer in the regulation of UGDH. Finally, both T325A and T325D mutants were significantly less efficient in promoting downstream hyaluronan production by HEK293 cells. These data support a model that requires an operational dimer-hexamer equilibrium to function efficiently and preserve regulated activity in the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2048219362,"Although regulatory mechanisms for immune cells with inhibitory signals via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs are well known, signals transduced via interaction between Siglecs and sialyl compounds on their counterreceptors into target cells have not been reported to date. In this study, we found that an astrocytoma cell line, AS, showed detachment from culture plates when co-cultured with Siglec-9-expressing cells and/or soluble Siglec-9. Moreover, detached AS cells regrew as co-cultured cells with Siglec-9-deficient cells. They also showed increased motility and invasiveness upon Siglec-9 binding. In immunoblotting, rapid degradation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and related signaling molecules such as Akt, paxillin, and p130Cas was observed immediately after the co-culture. Despite degradation of these molecules, increased p-Akt was found at the front region of the cytoplasm, probably reflecting increased cell motility. Calpain was considered to be a responsible protease for the protein degradation by the inhibition experiments. These results suggest that protein degradation of FAK and related molecules was induced by Siglec-9 binding to its counterreceptors via sialylglycoconjugates, leading to the modulation of adhesion kinetics of cancer cells.

Sialic acids are present as terminal monosaccharides linked to cell surface glycoconjugates and play roles in a variety of physiological and pathological events (1Varki N.M. Varki A. Diversity in cell surface sialic acid presentations: implications for biology and disease.Lab. Invest. 2007; 87: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). They are often a part of recognition sites for extrinsic pathogens (2Lehmann F. Tiralongo E. Tiralongo J. Sialic acid-specific lectins: occurrence, specificity and function.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1331-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), but they also play important roles by interacting with many intrinsic molecules, endogenous lectins. In particular, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) 2The abbreviations used are: Siglecsialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectinASastrocytomaCasCrk-associated substrateCIcell indexFAKfocal adhesion kinaseITIMimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifRT-CESreal-time cell electronic sensingGD2GalNAcβ1,4(NeuAcα2,8NeuAcα2,3)Galβ1,4Glc-ceramide)GD3NeuAcα2,8NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glc-ceramide. are unique endogenous lectins recognizing sialic acid-containing carbohydrates on glycoproteins and glycosphingolipids (3Crocker P.R.

There are currently 14 known Siglecs in humans and 9 in mice, and the majority of them are expressed on immune cells except Siglec-4 (3Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. Varki A. Siglecs and their roles in the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar). One of the intriguing findings about Siglecs is that many of them have intracellular domains containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and exert as inhibitory receptors to control the immune cells negatively (3Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. Varki A. Siglecs and their roles in the immune system.Nat. Rev.

Siglecs have been thought to regulate the functions of innate immune cells and adaptive immune systems based on glycan recognition. In particular, Siglec-7-mediated attenuation of natural killer cell and dendritic cell functions has been reported as an example of escape mechanisms of cancer cells from immune surveillance (4Pillai S. Netravali I.A. Cariappa A. Mattoo H. Siglecs and immune regulation.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 357-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Siglec-9 was isolated as a gene highly homologous to Siglec-7 (5Angata T. Varki A. Cloning, characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of Siglec-9, a new member of the CD33-related group of Siglecs: evidence for co-evolution with sialic acid synthesis pathways.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22127-22135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is expressed in monocytes and granulocytes. Although inhibitory functions of Siglec-9 in immune cells via ITIM motifs have been reported in some experimental systems (6Ohta M. Ishida A. Toda M. Akita K. Inoue M. Yamashita K. Watanabe M. Murata T. Usui T. Nakada H. Immunomodulation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells through ligation of tumor-produced mucins to Siglec-9.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 402: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the outcome of the interaction between Siglecs and their sialylated ligands inside cells expressing sialyl compounds has scarcely been studied to date. During the analysis of effects of interaction between Siglec-9 and its counterligands on cancer cells, we found marked degradation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in cancer cells and cell detachment from plates, suggesting apoptosis (7Aixinjueluo W. Furukawa K. Zhang Q. Hamamura K. Tokuda N. Yoshida S. Ueda R. Mechanisms for the apoptosis of small cell lung cancer cells induced by anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies: roles of anoikis.J. Biol.

Consequently, we have obtained interesting findings, suggesting novel implication of Siglec-9-mediated signaling in the regulation of adhesion dynamics of cancer cells. Anti-human Siglec-9 (goat pAb IgG) was purchased from R&D Systems. Anti-FAK C-terminal antibody (rabbit pAb IgG) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-FAK N-terminal antibody (mouse mAb IgG1) was from BD Biosciences. Anti-β-actin (mouse mAb IgG1) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-paxillin (mouse mAb IgG1) was from BD Biosciences. Anti-p130Cas (rabbit IgG, C-20), anti-FAK (rabbit IgG, C-20), anti-phospho-FAK Tyr-576-R (rabbit pAb), FAK Tyr-577-R (rabbit pAb), FAK Tyr-861-R (rabbit pAb), and FAK Tyr-925-R (rabbit pAb) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with HRP and anti-mouse IgG conjugated with HRP were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-SHP-1 (rabbit pAb IgG) was purchased from Millipore. See supplemental Experimental Procedures for additional explanation of materials and methods used. Cell surface expression of Siglec-9Fc-binding ligands was analyzed by FACS CaliverTM (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated with Siglec-9Fc (5 μg/100 μl in PBS) for 45 min on ice and then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Sigma) for 30 min on ice. Control cells for flow cytometry were prepared using the secondary antibody alone. For quantification of positive cells, the CELLQuestTM program was used. To analyze whether sialic acids are essential for Siglec-9Fc binding, 1 × 106 cells were applied in an FACS tube and incubated with neuramidase (200 milliunits/ml) from Vibrio cholera (Roche Applied Science) for 1 h at 37 °C. Then Siglec-9 binding was examined by flow cytometry as described below. U937Siglec-9-high cells and U937mock cells were suspended in cold PBS containing 2% FCS (2 × 107 cells/ml). To block nonspecific binding, U937 cells were incubated with Fc (5 μg/100 μl PBS) for 15 min in the dark on ice. Cells were then labeled with goat anti-human Siglec-9 antibody (R&D Systems) (10 μg) for 30 min on ice and washed three times with 2% FCS-containing PBS. Ten μg of rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 was then added and incubated for 30 min. Cells were analyzed using FACSAria IITM (BD Biosciences). Normal goat IgG was used as a negative control. U937Siglec-9-high cells were sorted from U937 transfected with pcDNA3.1-Siglec-9, and U937Siglec-9-low cells were sorted from U937mock cells. They were used for co-culture experiments as a positive or a negative group. pEE14-Siglec9–3C-Fc plasmid was generated by P. R. Crocker (8Zhang J.Q. Nicoll G. Jones C. Crocker P.R. Siglec-9, a novel sialic acid-binding member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed broadly on human blood leukocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22121-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). pcDNA 3.1-Fc plasmid was designed in our laboratory. Siglec-9Fc and Fc secreted from HEK293T cells were prepared by DEAE-dextran transfection, and fusion proteins were affinity-purified by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was measured by the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo). A human astrocytoma cell line AS (9Watanabe T. Pukel C.S. Takeyama H. Lloyd K.O. Shiku H. Li L.T. Travassos L.R. Oettgen H.F. Old L.J. Human melanoma antigen AH is an autoantigenic ganglioside related to GD2.J. Exp. Med. 1982; 156: 1884-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. Siglec-9-overexpressing human histiocytic lymphoma (monocyte) U937Siglec-9-high and U937mock cell lines were generated as described (10Mitsuki M. Nara K. Yamaji T. Enomoto A. Kanno M. Yamaguchi Y. Yamada A. Waguri S. Hashimoto Y. Siglec-7 mediates nonapoptotic cell death independently of its immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in monocytic cell line U937.Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), both of which were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and G418 (450 μg/ml). Cell adhesion and growth were monitored dynamically using the RT-CES system (SP v5.3) (ACEA Bioscience). Cell index (CI) is a parameter used to represent cell adhesion status based on the electrical impedance in gold electrodes at the bottom of plates. CI was collected every 15 min. One × 104 AS cells in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS (regular medium) were seeded into the wells of 16-well e-plates (ACEA Bioscience) and cultured for 24 h. Then, U937Siglec-9-high cells (10,000, 25,000, and 50,000) in 100 μl of the regular medium were added. Cells were co-cultured for 52 h or more in a 200-μl volume at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator. One ×105 of living or fixed U937Siglec-9-high were added in the inhibitor experiments. For the fixation, U937 cells were washed with plain medium and fixed with ethanol:acetic acid (95:5) for 20 min at 4 °C. They were washed four times with plain medium and then used for co-culture with AS cells. U937Siglec-9-low cells were used as a negative control. For the stimulation with Siglec-9Fc or Fc proteins, 1 × 104 AS cells in 200 μl of the regular medium were seeded in the wells of 16-well e-plates. CI was monitored for 24 h, then 15 μg of Siglec-9Fc or Fc proteins was applied into e-plates, and CI was continuously monitored. All samples are duplicated, and averages of results were used for statistical analysis. To examine whether degradation of FAK was caused by calpain, cells were preincubated with 25 μm MDL-28170 (Calpain Inhibitor III; Bachem AG, Bubendorf, Switzerland). AS cells were harvested using 2 mm EDTA/PBS, seeded into 6-well plates at 1 × 105/well, and maintained in the regular medium for 24 h at 37 °C. When growing cells covered approximately 70∼75% area of the wells, medium was exchanged with plain RPMI 1640 medium for deprivation of FCS. U937Siglec-9-high and U937Siglec-9-low cells were incubated in FCS-free RPMI 1640 medium for 4 h, then 1 × 106 of U937Siglec-9-high and U937Siglec-9-low cells were added and co-cultured with AS cells. U937 cells were carefully removed without disturbing AS cells by washing twice with plain RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were harvested at 5, 15, and 30 min after co-culture, then lysed with 1× lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) containing protease inhibitor mixture I (Calbiochem) and 1 mm PMSF (WAKO, Osaka, Japan). Protein concentration was measured by a BCA Protein Assay kit. To examine whether Siglec-9 recruits protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) in U937 cells after co-culture with AS cells, U937Siglec-9-high and U937Siglec-9-low co-cultured with AS cells for 15 and 30 min were used as sources of cell lysates. U937 cell lysates (300 μg) were precipitated with 2 μg of anti-human Siglec-9 antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and the precipitates were served for immunoblotting with anti-SHP-1 antibody. Migration activity of AS cells co-cultured with U937Siglec-9-high or U937Siglec-9-low was assessed by scratching assay. AS cells were plated in 6-well plates (1 × 105/well) and cultured for 48 h in 10% FCS-containing RPMI 1640 medium. When the cells reached 90% confluency, a scratch was generated using a 200-μl sterile tip. To remove cell debris, each well was rinsed twice with plain RPMI 1640 medium before co-culture. Then, the cells were overlaid with U937Siglec-9-high or U937Siglec-9-low cells (1 × 106/well) and cultured continuously for 24 h. The wound area images were photographed by a CCD camera (Olympus DP11, Olympus IX70) after carefully removing U937 cells by washing twice with plain RPMI 1640 medium at time 0, 12, and 24 h after the scratching. Wound healing spaces were measured using ImageJ v1.47d software (National Institutes of Health). The wound closure rates were obtained at 3 independent sites in the individual groups. Matrigel-coated chambers (BD Biosciences) were rehydrated according to the manufacturer's instruction. AS cells were detached by 2 mm EDTA/PBS and were applied into rehydrated upper chamber at 1 × 105/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (10% FCS). Three ml of RPMI 1640 medium (10% FCS) was applied into the lower chamber. At 15 min after plating cells, U937Siglec-9-high or U937Siglec-9-low cells were overlaid at 1 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium (10% FCS). After co-culture for 24 h at 37 °C, the upper chamber was fixed in 70% ethanol for 5 min, then the upper surface of the chamber was wiped with cotton swabs without disturbing the lower surfaces. The lower surface of the chamber was stained by Giemsa solution, and 10 random fields of the stained membranes were photographed by CCD camera. Then, cell number was counted by a cell counter plugin of ImageJ v1.47d software. To examine signaling pathways in AS and other cell lines, cell lysates (15 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE using 8% gels, and separated proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) for more than 6 h at 4 °C. The membrane was first probed with primary antibodies. After being washed, the blots were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgGs or horse anti-mouse IgGs conjugated with HRP (1:2000). After washing, bound conjugates were visualized with an ECLTM detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Band intensities were analyzed with ImageJ and standardized with β-actin. To determine the expression of Siglec-9 ligand-carrier molecules expressed on cancer cells, we performed flow cytometry using 75 human cancer cell lines. Simultaneously, Siglec-9 ligand-carrier molecules were isolated and identified using Siglec-9Fc (8Zhang J.Q. Nicoll G. Jones C. Crocker P.R. Siglec-9, a novel sialic acid-binding member of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed broadly on human blood leukocytes.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22121-22126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and mass spectrometry. The majority of all tested cell lines showed fairly high expression levels of Siglec-9 ligands on the cell surface as shown in supplemental Table S1. According to the score of mean fluorescence intensity, we used a human astrocytoma cell line AS in the following experiments as one of the Siglec-9 ligand-high-expressing cells (Fig. 1A). Proteins identified as Siglec-9 ligand-carrier molecules are summarized in supplemental Table S2. Results of further analysis will be reported elsewhere. Sialic acid-dependent binding of Siglec-9 was confirmed using neuraminidase as shown in Fig. 1B. To examine the effects of the interaction between immune cells and cancer cells via Siglec-9 on the signaling pathway in both sides of cells, co-culture experiments with U937 and AS cells were performed. Stable transfectant cell lines, U937Siglec-9-high and U937Siglec-9-low, were established as shown in Fig. 1C. These two transfectant lines were apparently similar suspension cells with no attachment to culture dishes. Morphological features of these cells are shown in Fig. 1D. AS cells are adherent cells, and U937 cells are suspension cells (leukemia), and their sizes are quite different, which allowed us to visually distinguish and experimentally separate them from each other very easily. The co-culture assay was performed by the RT-CES system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This system could assess the effect of interaction between AS cells and Siglec-9-expressing U937 cells on AS cells by measuring CI. Intensities of cell adhesion and spreading can be monitored in a real-time manner. Three kind of stimulants were used, i.e. living U937 cells, fixed ones, and soluble Siglec-9Fc or Fc proteins. The CI of AS cells decreased after co-culture with living U937Siglec-9-high cells at 63 h (5 × 104) and 71 h (2.5 × 104) of culture. No decrease in CI was found in AS cells co-cultured with U937Siglec-9-low cells (Fig. 2A). When AS cells were co-cultured with fixed U937Siglec-9-high, detachment of AS cells was detected immediately after addition of U937 cells. To examine the fates of detached cells, the FCS concentration was increased to 10%, resulting in the reattachment and regrowth of AS cells as shown in RT-CES (Fig. 2B). These features were also observed in a morphological approach (supplemental Fig. S1A). Immediate decrease of cell adhesion was detected when AS cells were treated by soluble Siglec-9Fc (150 μg/ml) in the regular medium, whereas it was gradually restored in CI (Fig. 2C). Considering the possibility that cell detachment represented cell deterioration due to toxic effects of Siglec-9 binding, immunoblotting for activated Caspase-3 and FACS analysis of Annexin V/propidium iodide was performed (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Neither activated Caspase-3 nor apoptosis induction was found in AS cells after co-culture with U937Siglec-9-high cells for 16 h in a FCS-free condition. Higher levels of cell death were found rather in AS cells co-cultured with U937Siglec-9-low (7% versus 1.76%) (supplemental Fig. S1C). Furthermore, SHP-1 was recruited at Siglec-9 in U937Siglec-9-high cells at 15 and 30 min after co-culture with AS cells, whereas no recruitment of SHP-1 was detected in U937Siglec-9-low cells (Fig. 3). This result suggested that Siglec-9 triggered inhibitory signals in U937 via the interaction with its ligands on AS cells as expected. No significant differences in cell growth activity were found during co-culture for 7 days in AS cells (supplemental Fig. S1D). Cell motility and invasion of AS cells were examined by wound healing assay and cell migration assay, respectively, when they were co-cultured with U937Siglec-9-high or U937Siglec-9-low cells. In the wound healing assay, AS cells co-cultured with U937Siglec-9-high showed significantly higher motility than the negative control and untreated cells (Fig. 4, A and B). In a Boyden chamber assay, AS cells co-cultured with U937Siglec-9-high also showed higher cell invasion than those co-cultured with U937Siglec-9-low (Fig. 4, C and D). To investigate what occurred in AS cells co-cultured with U937 with high or low levels of Siglec-9, we examined activation of representative proteins. To our surprise, total FAK bands dramatically decreased in AS cells co-cultured with U937Siglec-9-high. Accordingly, all phosphorylation site-specific FAK bands showed definite reduction in the band intensities (Fig. 5, A and B). Minimal changes in FAK and/or phosphorylated FAK were found in AS cells co-cultured with U937Siglec-9-low. Immunoblotting data of signaling proteins such as Akt, paxillin, and Crk-associated substrate protein (p130Cas) showed that they also underwent reduction in the band intensities (Fig. 5, C–F). In particular, the total Akt band showed marked degradation whereas phosphorylation bands at Thr-308 and Ser-473 did not reduce (Fig. 5, C and D). Bands of p-Akt Thr-308 rather increased in U937Siglec-9-high-treated cells at 15 min. Phosphorylated bands of paxillin and p130Cas also showed no changes (Fig. 5, E and F). No significant differences were found during co-culture with U937Siglec-9-low. By the treatment of AS cells with soluble Siglec-9Fc, similar degradation of FAK, Akt, p130Cas, and paxillin was also found, whereas Fc protein alone showed no effects (Fig. 6, A–D). When a complex of Siglec-9Fc with anti-human IgG F(ab′)2 was used, stronger degradation of FAK was found than in A (Fig. 6E). No significant differences in band intensities of total ERKs and Src and their phosphorylation forms were found between cells co-cultured with U937Siglec-9-high and those with U937Siglec-9-low (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). To clarify spatiotemporal dynamics of the protein degradation and its implication in cell behaviors, time courses of the degradation and intracellular localization of FAK and p-Akt were analyzed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7, FAK levels were restored at 12–24 h after the addition of FCS, whereas p-Akt Thr-308 levels increased in an earlier stage (∼60 min), probably reflecting increased cell motility in AS cells treated with U937Siglec-9-high. Immunocytochemistry revealed that FAK staining was markedly reduced in U937Siglec-9-high-treated AS cells, and remaining FAK was found only one side of cytoplasm compared with AS cells treated with U937Siglec-9-low, in which FAK was distributed highly and broadly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, simultaneous staining of FAK and p-Akt Thr-308 revealed that these two molecules were localized at the same side of cells, probably the front region of cells (Fig. 8B). Details are shown in supplemental Fig. S4. Degradation of FAK through Siglec-9 was examined in another cell lines, i.e. an ovarian cancer cell line (HEY) and a glioma cell line (U251). They showed similar FAK degradation during co-culture with U937Siglec-9-high (Fig. 9A) which indicated universality of the results with AS cells. Results of RT-CES also showed similar reduction of CI and subsequent restoration after FCS treatment as observed in AS cells (Fig. 9B). Sialic acid dependence of these protein degradations was examined by pretreatment of AS cells with neuraminidase before co-culture, resulting in the reduced degradation as expected (supplemental Fig. S3). To clarify whether the dynamic changes of bands in FAK, Akt, and so on during the co-culture of AS cells with U937Siglec-9-high cells were protein degradation due to proteolytic enzymes, blocking of calpain was performed because calpain seemed to be the most likely protease responsible for the cleavage of FAK (11Chan K.T. Bennin D.A. Huttenlocher A. Regulation of adhesion dynamics by calpain-mediated proteolysis of focal adhesion kinase (FAK).J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 11418-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In RT-CES, AS cells treated with U937Siglec-9-high and a calpain inhibitor MDL-28170 caused apparently less reduction of CI than those with U937Siglec-9-high alone (Fig. 10A). This was particularly clear when AS cells were treated with fixed U937Siglec-9-high and MDL-28170. These cells showed almost same pattern (no reduction of CI) as untreated cells (Fig. 10B), whereas AS cells treated with fixed U937Siglec-9-high alone showed definite CI reduction. This was also the case when AS cells were treated by Siglec-9Fc (Fig. 10C). By the treatment of AS cells with 25 μm MDL-28170 before co-culture with U937Siglec-9-high, degradation of FAK was completely suppressed (Fig. 11, A and B). This was also the case for Akt, p130Cas, and paxillin (Fig. 11, C and D), strongly suggesting that calpain was responsible for the degradation of these molecules. All of these results are summarized in Fig. 12.FIGURE 12Schema showing the results demonstrated in this paper.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The majority of past studies on Siglec-mediated signaling have been done with ITIM-associated inhibitory signals in immune cells. There have been no reports on the signaling in cancer cells that express counterreceptors with sugar chains recognized by Siglecs. In this study, we demonstrated, for the first time, that Siglec-9 triggered a signal, leading to degradation of FAK, Akt, and related molecules in cancer cells. The most novel point in this study is that cancer cells receive not death signals, but a sort of activation signal via interaction between Siglec-9 on immune cells and its counterreceptors on cancer cells. Furthermore, it was clearly shown that all observed differences in FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5 were due to the interaction between Siglec-9 and sialylglycoconjugates/carrier proteins because the presence/absence of Siglec-9 on U937 was the sole difference in our system, and the removal of sialic acids clearly canceled Siglec-9 binding and FAK degradation. FAK is a tyrosine kinase playing multiple functions in the cell signaling for cell adhesion (12Golubovskaya V.M. Focal adhesion kinase as a cancer therapy target.Anticancer Agents Med. Chem. 2010; 10: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), proliferation (13Hall J.E. Fu W. Schaller M.D. Focal adhesion kinase: exploring FAK structure to gain insight into function.Int.

Focal adhesion kinase and its signaling pathways in cell migration and angiogenesis.Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2011; 63: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar), and cancer metastasis (12Golubovskaya V.M. Focal adhesion kinase as a cancer therapy target.Anticancer Agents Med.

Biol. 2011; 288: 185-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). FAK is present mainly at the focal adhesion and plays essential roles by interacting with various signaling molecules such as p130Cas, paxillin, and Src family kinases (15Schaller M.D. Cellular functions of FAK kinases: insight into molecular mechanisms and novel functions.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). We have investigated the roles of FAK in the enhanced malignant properties such as cell proliferation (16Hamamura K. Tsuji M. Ohkawa Y. Nakashima H. Miyazaki S. Urano T. Yamamoto N. Ueda M. Furukawa K. Focal adhesion kinase as well as p130Cas and paxillin is crucially involved in the enhanced malignant properties under expression of ganglioside GD3 in melanoma cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (17Ohkawa Y. Miyazaki S. Hamamura K. Kambe M. Miyata M. Tajima O. Ohmi Y. Yamauchi Y. Furukawa K. Ganglioside GD3 enhances adhesion signals and augments malignant properties of melanoma cells by recruiting integrins to glycolipid-enriched microdomains.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27213-27223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in malignant melanomas expressing ganglioside GD3. Apoptosis induction of small cell lung cancer cells by anti-ganglioside GD2 monoclonal antibodies via dephosphorylation of FAK was also reported by us (7Aixinjueluo W. Furukawa K. Zhang Q. Hamamura K. Tokuda N. Yoshida S. Ueda R. Mechanisms for the apoptosis of small cell lung cancer cells induced by anti-GD2 monoclonal antibodies: roles of anoikis.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29828-29836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition to enhanced adhesion to extracellular matrix, increased migration and cell motility are also a hallmark of cancer cells (18Friedl P. Gilmour D. Collective cell migration in morphogenesis, regeneration and cancer.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). FAK has been considered to regulate cell migration by orchestrating signals between growth factor receptors and integrins (19Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Schlaepfer D.D. Required role of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) for integrin-stimulated cell migration.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although FAK is important in the cell adhesion in association with integrins, it is also essential for the regulation of focal adhesion disassembly (20Webb D.J. Donais K. Whitmore L.A. Thomas S.M. Turner C.E. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.F. FAK-Src signalling through paxillin, ERK and MLCK regulates adhesion disassembly.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Degradation of FAK might be important for the promotion of cell migration by regulation of adhesion dynamics (11Chan K.T. Bennin D.A. Huttenlocher A. Regulation of adhesion dynamics by calpain-mediated proteolysis of focal adhesion kinase (FAK).J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 11418-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In our results, FAK underwent rapid degradation in cancer cells after co-culture with Siglec-9-expressing cells. Representative tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of FAK also degraded along with total FAK. However, cell migration and invasion activities increased after co-culture. These paradoxical results might indicate the differences in the roles of FAK depending on the spatial and temporal dynamics of cell adhesion and migration as shown in Fig. 12. Signaling molecules other than FAK showed sustained levels of individual phosphorylated forms during co-culture, suggesting partially overlapping activation of those molecules with FAK degradation. Among molecules that showed sustained activated levels, we focused on p-Akt Thr-308 because of its increased phosphorylation in the early phase of co-culture, and we could show its localization in the front side of AS cells as well as remaining FAK. These results should explain, at least partly, mechanisms for the increased migration of AS cells undergoing FAK degradation as shown in Fig. 12. Increased activation of Akt Thr-308 as shown in Fig. 5, C and D, might also be involved in the resistance to apoptosis in AS cells (21Li B. Desai S.A. MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. Fan L. Spencer D.M. A novel conditional Akt “survival switch” reversibly protects cells from apoptosis.Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Details in the spatiotemporal regulation of FAK molecules as well as its related molecules in the cell migration remain to be investigated. Results obtained in this study suggested that proteolytic enzymes should be activated and exert for the transient degradation of a wide range of signaling molecules. A possible protease responsible for the degradation of FAK should be calpain (11Chan K.T. Bennin D.A. Huttenlocher A. Regulation of adhesion dynamics by calpain-mediated proteolysis of focal adhesion kinase (FAK).J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 11418-11426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. v-Src's hold over actin and cell adhesions.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) as revealed by its inhibitor. Results of experiments for mobility and apoptosis also support the concept that the protein degradation observed in co-culture might be beneficial for cancer cell migration and survival in addition to the simultaneously induced inhibitory signals in immune cells (U937 in this study), leading to the escape from immunosurveillance. Thus, sialylated complex carbohydrates expressed on the cell surface of cancer cells might play very important roles in the two directions, i.e. transduction of inhibitory signals in immune cells via Siglec-9 and of activation signals to lead activation of calpain and subsequent increases in cell motility and survival of cancer cells. Significances of the degradation of Akt, paxillin, and p130Cas are not clear at this moment. However, phosphorylated Akts, paxillin, and p130Cas did not reduce or sometimes increased during the co-culture, suggesting that they undergo differential regulation and exert distinct roles depending on the phosphorylation status. The facts that not only Siglec-9-expressing living cells, but also fixed Siglec-9-expressing cells and even soluble Siglec-9 proteins could induce similar cell responses such as cell detachment from plates and increased cell movement strongly suggested that cell surface Siglec-9 actually triggers countersignals in cancer cells via Siglec-9-recognizing sugar chains. Because binding specificity of Siglec-9 is broad (2Lehmann F. Tiralongo E. Tiralongo J. Sialic acid-specific lectins: occurrence, specificity and function.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 1331-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 4Pillai S. Netravali I.A. Cariappa A. Mattoo H. Siglecs and immune regulation.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 30: 357-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), multiple molecules may be recognized by Siglec-9 as shown in supplemental Table S2. Although it is not easy to identify crucial molecules as functional counterreceptors for Siglec-9 in cancer cells, identification of such counterreceptors carrying sialylglycoconjugates should allow us to focus target molecules for the cancer therapeutics. These trials are now ongoing in our group. We thank P. R. Crocker at Dundee University for kindly providing an expression vector for Siglec-9Fc and T. Mizuno and Y. Nakayasu for technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2142060735,"Numerous widespread Alpine plant species show molecular differentiation among populations from distinct regions. This has been explained as the result of genetic drift during glacial survival in isolated refugia along the border of the European Alps. Since genetic drift may affect molecular markers and phenotypic traits alike, we asked whether phenotypic differentiation mirrors molecular patterns among Alpine plant populations from different regions. Phenotypic traits can be under selection, so we additionally investigated whether part of the phenotypic differentiation can be explained by past selection and/or current adaptation. Using the monocarpic Campanula thyrsoides as our study species, a common garden experiment with plants from 21 populations from four phylogeographic groups located in regions across the Alps and the Jura Mountains was performed to test for differentiation in morphological and phenological traits. Past selection was investigated by comparing phenotypic differentiation among and within regions with molecular differentiation among and within regions. The common garden results indicated regional differentiation among populations for all investigated phenotypic traits, particularly in phenology. Delayed flowering in plants from the South-eastern Alps suggested adaptation to long sub-mediterranean summers and contrasted with earlier flowering of plants experiencing shorter growing seasons in regions with higher elevation to the West. Comparisons between molecular and phenotypic differentiation revealed diversifying selection among regions in height and biomass, which is consistent with adaptation to environmental conditions in glacial refugia. Within regions, past selection acted against strong diversification for most phenotypic traits, causing restricted postglacial adaptation. Evidence consistent with post-glacial adaptation was also given by negative correlation coefficients between several phenotypic traits and elevation of the population's origin. In conclusion, our study suggests that, irrespective of adaptation of plants to their current environment, glacial history can have a strong and long-lasting influence on the phenotypic evolution of Alpine plants."
https://openalex.org/W2039595529,"This study examined whether the degree of complexity of a grammatical component in a language would impact on its representation in the brain through identifying the neural correlates of grammatical morpheme processing associated with nouns and verbs in Chinese. In particular, the processing of Chinese nominal classifiers and verbal aspect markers were investigated in a sentence completion task and a grammaticality judgment task to look for converging evidence. The Chinese language constitutes a special case because it has no inflectional morphology per se and a larger classifier than aspect marker inventory, contrary to the pattern of greater verbal than nominal paradigmatic complexity in most European languages. The functional imaging results showed BA47 and left supplementary motor area and superior medial frontal gyrus more strongly activated for classifier processing, and the left posterior middle temporal gyrus more responsive to aspect marker processing. We attributed the activation in the left prefrontal cortex to greater processing complexity during classifier selection, analogous to the accounts put forth for European languages, and the left posterior middle temporal gyrus to more demanding verb semantic processing. The overall findings significantly contribute to cross-linguistic observations of neural substrates underlying processing of grammatical morphemes from an analytic and a classifier language, and thereby deepen our understanding of neurobiology of human language."
https://openalex.org/W2168430167,"Within T-cell-dependent germinal centers, p53 gene transcription is repressed by Bcl-6 and is thus less vulnerable to mutation. Malignant lymphomas within inflamed extranodal sites exhibit a relatively high incidence of p53 mutations. The latter might originate from normal B-cell clones manifesting activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) and up-regulated p53 following T-cell-independent (TI) stimulation. We here examine p53 gene transcription in such TI clones, with a focus on modulatory effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and evaluate progeny for p53 mutations. Resting IgM(+)IgD(+)CD27(-) B cells from human tonsils were labeled with CFSE and stimulated in vitro with complement-coated antigen surrogate, IL-4, and BAFF ± exogenous PGE2 (50 nM) or an analog specific for the EP2 PGE2 receptor. We use flow cytometry to measure p53 and AID protein within variably divided blasts, qRT-PCR of p53 mRNA from cultures with or without actinomycin D to monitor mRNA transcription/stability, and single-cell p53 RT-PCR/sequencing to assess progeny for p53 mutations. We report that EP2 signaling triggers increased p53 gene transcriptional activity in AID(+) cycling blasts (P<0.01). Progeny exhibit p53 mutations at a frequency (8.5 × 10(-4)) greater than the baseline error rate (<0.8 × 10(-4)). We conclude that, devoid of the repressive influences of Bcl-6, dividing B lymphoblasts in inflamed tissues should display heightened p53 transcription and increased risk of p53 mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1982157085,"Disulfide bond formation protein B (DsbBS-S,S-S) is an inner membrane protein in Escherichia coli that has two disulfide bonds (S-S, S-S) that play a role in oxidization of a pair of cysteine residues (SH, SH) in disulfide bond formation protein A (DsbASH,SH). The oxidized DsbAS-S, with one disulfide bond (S-S), can oxidize proteins with SH groups for maturation of a folding preprotein. Here, we have described the transient kinetics of the oxidation reaction between DsbASH,SH and DsbBS-S,S-S. We immobilized DsbBS-S,S-S embedded in lipid bilayers on the surface of a 27-MHz quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) device to detect both formation and degradation of the reaction intermediate (DsbA-DsbB), formed via intermolecular disulfide bonds, as a mass change in real time. The obtained kinetic parameters (intermediate formation, reverse, and oxidation rate constants (kf, kr, and kcat, respectively) indicated that the two pairs of cysteine residues in DsbBS-S,S-S were more important for the stability of the DsbA-DsbB intermediate than ubiquinone, an electron acceptor for DsbBS-S,S-S. Our data suggested that the reaction pathway of almost all DsbASH,SH oxidation processes would proceed through this stable intermediate, avoiding the requirement for ubiquinone."
https://openalex.org/W2038665076,"Mutations in the gene coding for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) are associated with familiar forms of the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These mutations are believed to result in a ""gain of toxic function"", leading to neuronal degeneration. The exact mechanism is still unknown, but misfolding/aggregation events are generally acknowledged as important pathological events in this process. Recently, we observed that demetallated apoSOD1, with cysteine 6 and 111 substituted for alanine, is toxic to cultured neuroblastoma cells. This toxicity depended on an intact, high affinity Zn(2+) site. It was therefor contradictory to discover that wild-type apoSOD1 was not toxic, despite of its high affinity for Zn(2+). This inconsistency was hypothesized to originate from erroneous disulfide formation involving C6 and C111. Using high resolution non-reducing SDS-PAGE, we have in this study demonstrated that the inability of wild-type apoSOD1 to cause cell death stems from formation of non-native intra-molecular disulfides. Moreover, monomeric apoSOD1 variants capable of such disulfide scrambling aggregated into ThT positive oligomers under physiological conditions without agitation. The oligomers were stabilized by inter-molecular disulfides and morphologically resembled what has in other neurodegenerative diseases been termed protofibrils. Disulfide scrambling thus appears to be an important event for misfolding and aggregation of SOD1, but may also be significant for protein function involving cysteines, e.g. mitochondrial import and copper loading."
https://openalex.org/W2149134893,"Predicting protein functional classes such as localization sites and modifications plays a crucial role in function annotation. Given a tremendous amount of sequence data yielded from high-throughput sequencing experiments, the need of efficient and interpretable prediction strategies has been rapidly amplified. Our previous approach for subcellular localization prediction, PSLDoc, archives high overall accuracy for Gram-negative bacteria. However, PSLDoc is computational intensive due to incorporation of homology extension in feature extraction and probabilistic latent semantic analysis in feature reduction. Besides, prediction results generated by support vector machines are accurate but generally difficult to interpret. In this work, we incorporate three new techniques to improve efficiency and interpretability. First, homology extension is performed against a compact non-redundant database using a fast search model to reduce running time. Second, correspondence analysis (CA) is incorporated as an efficient feature reduction to generate a clear visual separation of different protein classes. Finally, functional classes are predicted by a combination of accurate compact set (CS) relation and interpretable one-nearest neighbor (1-NN) algorithm. Besides localization data sets, we also apply a human protein kinase set to validate generality of our proposed method. Experiment results demonstrate that our method make accurate prediction in a more efficient and interpretable manner. First, homology extension using a fast search on a compact database can greatly accelerate traditional running time up to twenty-five times faster without sacrificing prediction performance. This suggests that computational costs of many other predictors that also incorporate homology information can be largely reduced. In addition, CA can not only efficiently identify discriminative features but also provide a clear visualization of different functional classes. Moreover, predictions based on CS achieve 100% precision. When combined with 1-NN on unpredicted targets by CS, our method attains slightly better or comparable performance compared with the state-of-the-art systems."

Cell proliferation was assessed at days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, and 21. Pelp1 protein expression in the nucleus and cytoplasm were detected by immunocytochemical analysis. Real-time RT-PCR and western blot were used to detect mRNA and protein expressions of Pelp1, osteocalcin (OCN), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).Over 21 days, rBMSCs in routine culture exhibited a 1-2 day lag phase and exponential growth from day 3 to 9, plateauing at day 9, and correlated with temporal mRNA expression of Pelp1, which almost reached baseline levels at day 21. In osteogenic induction cultures, Pelp1 mRNA levels rose at day 9 and steadily increased until day 21, reaching 6.8-fold greater value compared with day 1. Interestingly, Pelp1 mRNA expression in osteogenic cultures exhibited a trend similar to that of OCN expression. Pelp1 knockdown by siRNA transfection inhibited undifferentiated rBMSC proliferation, and bone markers OCN and ALP expressions in rBMSCs cultured in routine and osteogenic differentiation media.Pelp1 may be a key player in BMSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, meriting further consideration as a target for development of therapies for pathological bone loss conditions, such as menopausal bone loss."

Existing models of diseases with glomerular endothelial cell (EC) injury, collectively grouped as thrombotic microangiopathies, are problematic, impeding investigation of the mechanisms of microvascular defense and repair. To develop a model of glomerular endothelial injury in the mouse, we conjugated the M. oreades lectin to the cytotoxin, saporin, (LS) to selectively injure the glomerular endothelium. Injury of the microvasculature was evaluated by light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy, and by quantitative RT-PCR of cell-type specific transcripts. Renal function was evaluated by quantitation of serum creatinine. The toxin conjugate induced apoptosis of microvascular ECs in vitro, and subtle histologic features of thrombotic microangiopathy in vivo that were enhanced by co-injection of 50 μg/kg LPS. Among LS/LPS-treated animals, loss of glomerular EC staining correlated with decreased expression of EC-specific transcripts, and impaired kidney function. Selective injury of the glomerular microvasculature with LS toxin conjugate and LPS elicits histologic features of thrombotic microangiopathy and acute kidney failure."
https://openalex.org/W1973511299,"Previous researches show that buy (growth) companies conduct income increasing earnings management in order to meet forecasts and generate positive forecast Errors (FEs). This behavior however, is not inherent in sell (non-growth) companies. Using the aforementioned background, this research hypothesizes that since sell companies are pressured to avoid income increasing earnings management, they are capable, and in fact more inclined, to pursue income decreasing Forecast Management (FM) with the purpose of generating positive FEs. Using a sample of 6553 firm-years of companies that are listed in the NYSE between the years 2005–2010, the study determines that sell companies conduct income decreasing FM to generate positive FEs. However, the frequency of positive FEs of sell companies does not exceed that of buy companies. Using the efficiency perspective, the study suggests that even though buy and sell companies have immense motivation in avoiding negative FEs, they exploit different but efficient strategies, respectively, in order to meet forecasts. Furthermore, the findings illuminated the complexities behind informative and opportunistic forecasts that falls under the efficiency versus opportunistic theories in literature."
