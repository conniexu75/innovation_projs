https://openalex.org/W2767035585,"Cerebellar abnormalities, particularly in Right Crus I (RCrusI), are consistently reported in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although RCrusI is functionally connected with ASD-implicated circuits, the contribution of RCrusI dysfunction to ASD remains unclear. Here neuromodulation of RCrusI in neurotypical humans resulted in altered functional connectivity with the inferior parietal lobule, and children with ASD showed atypical functional connectivity in this circuit. Atypical RCrusI-inferior parietal lobule structural connectivity was also evident in the Purkinje neuron (PN) TscI ASD mouse model. Additionally, chemogenetically mediated inhibition of RCrusI PN activity in mice was sufficient to generate ASD-related social, repetitive, and restricted behaviors, while stimulation of RCrusI PNs rescued social impairment in the PN TscI ASD mouse model. Together, these studies reveal important roles for RCrusI in ASD-related behaviors. Further, the rescue of social behaviors in an ASD mouse model suggests that investigation of the therapeutic potential of cerebellar neuromodulation in ASD may be warranted."

Two-photon computer-generated holography enables precise sculpting of light and could in principle enable simultaneous illumination of many neurons in a network, with the requisite temporal precision to simulate accurate neural codes. We designed a high-efficacy soma-targeted opsin, finding that fusing the N-terminal 150 residues of kainate receptor subunit 2 (KA2) to the recently discovered high-photocurrent channelrhodopsin CoChR restricted expression of this opsin primarily to the cell body of mammalian cortical neurons. In combination with two-photon holographic stimulation, we found that this somatic CoChR (soCoChR) enabled photostimulation of individual cells in mouse cortical brain slices with single-cell resolution and <1-ms temporal precision. We used soCoChR to perform connectivity mapping on intact cortical circuits."

However, how the central amygdala participates in such a learning process remains unclear. Here we show that PKC-Î´-expressing central amygdala neurons are essential for the synaptic plasticity underlying learning in the lateral amygdala, as they convey information about the unconditioned stimulus to lateral amygdala neurons during fear conditioning."
https://openalex.org/W2765135072,"Spontaneous fluctuations in hemodynamic signals in the absence of a task or overt stimulation are used to infer neural activity. We tested this coupling by simultaneously measuring neural activity and changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) in the somatosensory cortex of awake, head-fixed mice during periods of true rest and during whisker stimulation and volitional whisking. We found that neurovascular coupling was similar across states and that large, spontaneous CBV changes in the absence of sensory input were driven by volitional whisker and body movements. Hemodynamic signals during periods of rest were weakly correlated with neural activity. Spontaneous fluctuations in CBV and vessel diameter persisted when local neural spiking and glutamatergic input were blocked, as well as during blockade of noradrenergic receptors, suggesting a non-neuronal origin for spontaneous CBV fluctuations. Spontaneous hemodynamic signals reflect a combination of behavior, local neural activity, and putatively non-neural processes."
https://openalex.org/W2765550888,"The valuation of food is a fundamental component of our decision-making. Yet little is known about how value signals for food and other rewards are constructed by the brain. Using a food-based decision task in human participants, we found that subjective values can be predicted from beliefs about constituent nutritive attributes of food: protein, fat, carbohydrates and vitamin content. Multivariate analyses of functional MRI data demonstrated that, while food value is represented in patterns of neural activity in both medial and lateral parts of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), only the lateral OFC represents the elemental nutritive attributes. Effective connectivity analyses further indicate that information about the nutritive attributes represented in the lateral OFC is integrated within the medial OFC to compute an overall value. These findings provide a mechanistic account for the construction of food value from its constituent nutrients. Suzuki et al. found that food valuation is related to beliefs about nutritive attributes. Functional MRI revealed these attribute codes in lateral orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting a mechanism by which value signals are constructed from constituent attributes."

https://openalex.org/W2767493153,"Humans often rank craniofacial pain as more severe than body pain. Evidence suggests that a stimulus of the same intensity induces stronger pain in the face than in the body. However, the underlying neural circuitry for the differential processing of facial versus bodily pain remains unknown. Interestingly, the lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBL), a critical node in the affective pain circuit, is activated more strongly by noxious stimulation of the face than of the hindpaw. Using a novel activity-dependent technology called CANE developed in our laboratory, we identified and selectively labeled noxious-stimulus-activated PBL neurons and performed comprehensive anatomical input-output mapping. Surprisingly, we uncovered a hitherto uncharacterized monosynaptic connection between cranial sensory neurons and the PBL-nociceptive neurons. Optogenetic activation of this monosynaptic craniofacial-to-PBL projection induced robust escape and avoidance behaviors and stress calls, whereas optogenetic silencing specifically reduced facial nociception. The monosynaptic circuit revealed here provides a neural substrate for heightened craniofacial affective pain."
https://openalex.org/W2765488260,"Haploinsufficiency of the AT-rich interactive domain 1B (ARID1B) gene causes autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability; however, the neurobiological basis for this is unknown. Here we generated Arid1b-knockout mice and examined heterozygotes to model human patients. Arid1b-heterozygous mice showed a decreased number of cortical GABAergic interneurons and reduced proliferation of interneuron progenitors in the ganglionic eminence. Arid1b haploinsufficiency also led to an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the cerebral cortex. Furthermore, we found that Arid1b haploinsufficiency suppressed histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) overall and particularly reduced H3K9ac of the Pvalb promoter, resulting in decreased transcription. Arid1b-heterozygous mice exhibited abnormal cognitive and social behaviors, which were rescued by treatment with a positive allosteric GABAA receptor modulator. Our results demonstrate a critical role for Arid1b in interneuron development and behavior and provide insight into the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability."
https://openalex.org/W2767910296,"Detailed observations of transcriptional, translational and post-translational events in the human brain are essential to improving our understanding of its development, function and vulnerability to disease. Here, we exploited label-free quantitative tandem mass-spectrometry to create an in-depth proteomic survey of regions of the postnatal human brain, ranging in age from early infancy to adulthood. Integration of protein data with existing matched whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) from the BrainSpan project revealed varied patterns of protein-RNA relationships, with generally increased magnitudes of protein abundance differences between brain regions compared to RNA. Many of the differences amplified in protein data were reflective of cytoarchitectural and functional variation between brain regions. Comparing structurally similar cortical regions revealed significant differences in the abundances of receptor-associated and resident plasma membrane proteins that were not readily observed in the RNA expression data."
https://openalex.org/W2765677872,"All animals must detect noxious stimuli to initiate protective behavior, but the evolutionary origin of nociceptive systems is not well understood. Here we show that noxious heat and irritant chemicals elicit robust escape behaviors in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and that the conserved ion channel TRPA1 is required for these responses. TRPA1-mutant Drosophila flies are also defective in noxious-heat responses. We find that either planarian or human TRPA1 can restore noxious-heat avoidance to TRPA1-mutant Drosophila, although neither is directly activated by heat. Instead, our data suggest that TRPA1 activation is mediated by H2O2 and reactive oxygen species, early markers of tissue damage rapidly produced as a result of heat exposure. Together, our data reveal a core function for TRPA1 in noxious heat transduction, demonstrate its conservation from planarians to humans, and imply that animal nociceptive systems may share a common ancestry, tracing back to a progenitor that lived more than 500 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2767510644,"Experience-dependent plasticity in the mature visual system is widely considered to be cortical. Using chronic two-photon Ca2+ imaging of thalamic afferents in layer 1 of binocular visual cortex, we provide evidence against this tenet: the respective dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) cells showed pronounced ocular dominance (OD) shifts after monocular deprivation in adult mice. Most (86%), but not all, of dLGN cell boutons were monocular during normal visual experience. Following deprivation, initially deprived-eye-dominated boutons reduced or lost their visual responsiveness to that eye and frequently became responsive to the non-deprived eye. This cannot be explained by eye-specific cortical changes propagating to dLGN via cortico-thalamic feedback because the shift in dLGN responses was largely resistant to cortical inactivation using the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol. Our data suggest that OD shifts observed in the binocular visual cortex of adult mice may at least partially reflect plasticity of eye-specific inputs onto dLGN neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2769291426,"Accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is essential for TB elimination. However, the absence of a gold standard test for diagnosing LTBI makes assessment of the true prevalence of LTBI and the accuracy of diagnostic tests challenging. Bayesian latent class models can be used to make inferences about disease prevalence and the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests using data on the concordance between tests. We performed the largest meta-analysis to date aiming to evaluate the performance of tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for LTBI diagnosis in various patient populations using Bayesian latent class modelling.Systematic search of PubMeb, Embase and African Index Medicus was conducted without date and language restrictions on September 11, 2017 to identify studies that compared the performance of TST and IGRAs for LTBI diagnosis. Two IGRA methods were considered: QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT) and T-SPOT.TB. Studies were included if they reported 2x2 agreement data between TST and QFT-GIT or T-SPOT.TB. A Bayesian latent class model was developed to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of TST and IGRAs in various populations, including immune-competent adults, immune-compromised adults and children. A TST cut-off value of 10 mm was used for immune-competent subjects and 5 mm for immune-compromised individuals.A total of 157 studies were included in the analysis. In immune-competent adults, the sensitivity of TST and QFT-GIT were estimated to be 84% (95% credible interval [CrI] 82-85%) and 52% (50-53%), respectively. The specificity of QFT-GIT was 97% (96-97%) in non-BCG-vaccinated and 93% (92-94%) in BCG-vaccinated immune-competent adults. The estimated figures for TST were 100% (99-100%) and 79% (76-82%), respectively. T-SPOT.TB has comparable specificity (97% for both tests) and better sensitivity (68% versus 52%) than QFT-GIT in immune-competent adults. In immune-compromised adults, both TST and QFT-GIT display low sensitivity but high specificity. QFT-GIT and TST are equally specific (98% for both tests) in non-BCG-vaccinated children; however, QFT-GIT is more specific than TST (98% versus 82%) in BCG-vaccinated group. TST is more sensitive than QFT-GIT (82% versus 73%) in children.This study is the first to assess the utility of TST and IGRAs for LTBI diagnosis in different population groups using all available data with Bayesian latent class modelling. Our results challenge the current beliefs about the performance of LTBI screening tests, and have important implications for LTBI screening policy and practice. We estimated that the performance of IGRAs is not as reliable as previously measured in the general population. However, IGRAs are not or minimally affected by BCG and should be the preferred tests in this setting. Adoption of IGRAs in settings where BCG is widely administered will allow for a more accurate identification and treatment of LTBI."

https://openalex.org/W2768423490,"Tumor metastasis involves cancer cell invasion across basement membranes and interstitial tissues. The initial invasion step consists of adherence of the tumor cell to the extracellular matrix (ECM), and this binding transduces a variety of signals from the ECM to the tumor cell. Accordingly, it is critical to establish the mechanisms by which extracellular cues influence the intracellular activities that regulate tumor cell invasion. Here, we found that invasion of the basal-like breast cancer cell line BT-549 is enhanced by the ECM component chondroitin sulfates (CSs). CSs interacted with and induced proteolytic cleavage of N-cadherin in the BT-549 cells, yielding a C-terminal intracellular N-cadherin fragment that formed a complex with Î²-catenin. Of note, the cleavage of N-cadherin increased cytoplasmic and nuclear Î²-catenin levels; induced the matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) gene, a target of Î²-catenin nuclear signaling; and augmented the invasion potential of the cells. We also found that CS-induced N-cadherin proteolysis requires caveolae-mediated endocytosis. An inhibitor of that process, nystatin, blocked both the endocytosis and proteolytic cleavage of N-cadherin induced by CS and also suppressed BT-549 cell invasion. Knock-out of chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (C4ST-1), a key CS biosynthetic enzyme, suppressed activation of the N-cadherin/Î²-catenin pathway through N-cadherin endocytosis and significantly decreased BT-549 cell invasion. These results suggest that CSs produced by C4ST-1 might be useful therapeutic targets in the management of basal-like breast cancers.

https://openalex.org/W2769789562,"Cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) in their environment and cellular lipids play an important role in their formation, secretion and uptake. Besides, there is also evidence that EV transferred lipids impact on recipientâs cell signaling. Cellular senescence is characterized by a state of permanent proliferation arrest and represents a barrier towards the development of neoplastic lesions. A peculiar feature of senescence is the release of many soluble factors, the so-called Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype, which play a key role in triggering paracrine senescence signals. Recently, evidences have suggested that this phenotype includes not only soluble factors, but also EVs. To identify lipid signatures associated with H-Ras-induced senescence in EVs, we expressed active H-Ras (H-RasV12) in human fibroblasts and investigated how it affects EV release and lipid composition. An enrichment of hydroxylated sphingomyelin, lyso- and ether-linked phospholipids and specific H-Ras-induced senescence signatures, e.g. sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidic acid and sulfatides, were found in EVs compared to cells. Furthermore, H-RasV12 expression in fibroblasts was associated with higher levels of tetraspanins involved in vesicle formation."
https://openalex.org/W2768797310,"Lakes and ponds derived from thawing permafrost are strong emitters of carbon dioxide and methane to the atmosphere, but little is known about the methane oxidation processes in these waters. Here we investigated the distribution and potential activity of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria in thaw ponds in two types of eroding permafrost landscapes in subarctic QuÃ©bec: peatlands and mineral soils. We hypothesized that methanotrophic community composition and potential activity differ regionally as a function of the landscape type and permafrost degradation stage, and locally as a function of depth-dependent oxygen conditions. Our analysis of pmoA transcripts by Illumina amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR showed that the communities were composed of diverse and potentially active lineages. Type I methanotrophs, particularly Methylobacter, dominated all communities, however there was a clear taxonomic separation between the two landscape types, consistent with environmental control of community structure. In contrast, methanotrophic potential activity, measured by pmoA transcript concentrations, did not vary with landscape type, but correlated with conductivity, phosphorus and total suspended solids. Methanotrophic potential activity was also detected in low-oxygen bottom waters, where it was inversely correlated with methane concentrations, suggesting methane depletion by methanotrophs. Methanotrophs were present and potentially active throughout the water column regardless of oxygen concentration, and may therefore be resilient to future mixing and oxygenation regimes in the warming subarctic."
https://openalex.org/W2770731734,"The Hippo pathway plays important roles in controlling organ size and in suppressing tumorigenesis through large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (LATS1/2)âmediated phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ transcription co-activators. The kinase activity of LATS1/2 is regulated by phosphorylation in response to extracellular signals. Moreover, LATS2 protein levels are repressed by the ubiquitinâproteasome system in conditions such as hypoxia. However, the mechanism that removes the ubiquitin modification from LATS2 and thereby stabilizes the protein is not well understood. Here, using tandem affinity purification (TAP), we found that anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase complex, and USP9X, a deubiquitylase, specifically interact with LATS2. We also found that although APC1 co-localizes with LATS2 to intracellular vesicle structures, it does not regulate LATS2 protein levels and activity. In contrast, USP9X ablation drastically diminished LATS2 protein levels. We further demonstrated that USP9X deubiquitinates LATS2 and thus prevents LATS2 degradation by the proteasome. Furthermore, in pancreatic cancer cells, USP9X loss activated YAP and enhanced the oncogenic potential of the cells. In addition, the tumorigenesis induced by the USP9X ablation depended not only on LATS2 repression, but also on YAP/TAZ activity. We conclude that USP9X is a deubiquitylase of the Hippo pathway kinase LATS2 and that the Hippo pathway functions as a downstream signaling cascade that mediates USP9X's tumor-suppressive activity."
https://openalex.org/W2769362787,"The tautomerase superfamily (TSF) consists of more than 11,000 nonredundant sequences present throughout the biosphere. Characterized members have attracted much attention because of the unusual and key catalytic role of an N-terminal proline. These few characterized members catalyze a diverse range of chemical reactions, but the full scale of their chemical capabilities and biological functions remains unknown. To gain new insight into TSF structure-function relationships, we performed a global analysis of similarities across the entire superfamily and computed a sequence similarity network to guide classification into distinct subgroups. Our results indicate that TSF members are found in all domains of life, with most being present in bacteria. The eukaryotic members of the cis-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase subgroup are limited to fungal species, whereas the macrophage migration inhibitory factor subgroup has wide eukaryotic representation (including mammals). Unexpectedly, we found that 346 TSF sequences lack Pro-1, of which 85% are present in the malonate semialdehyde decarboxylase subgroup. The computed network also enabled the identification of similarity paths, namely sequences that link functionally diverse subgroups and exhibit transitional structural features that may help explain reaction divergence. A structure-guided comparison of these linker proteins identified conserved transitions between them, and kinetic analysis paralleled these observations. Phylogenetic reconstruction of the linker set was consistent with these findings. Our results also suggest that contemporary TSF members may have evolved from a short 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase-like ancestor followed by gene duplication and fusion. Our new linker-guided strategy can be used to enrich the discovery of sequence/structure/function transitions in other enzyme superfamilies."
https://openalex.org/W2768916657,"Identifying isolated teeth of fossil selachians only based on qualitative characters is sometimes hindered by similarity in their morphology, resulting often in heated taxonomic debates. On the other hand, the use of quantitative characters (i.e. measurements) has been often neglected or underestimated in characterization and identification of fossil teeth of selachians. Here we show that, employing a robust methodological protocol based on principal component and discriminant analyses on a sample of 175 isolated fossil teeth of lamniform sharks, the traditional morphometrics can be useful to support and complement the classic taxonomic identification made on qualitative features. Furthermore, we show that discriminant analysis can be successfully useful to assign indeterminate isolated shark teeth to a certain taxon. Finally, the degree of separation of the clusters might be used to predict functional and probably also phylogenetic signals in lamniform shark teeth. However, this needs to be tested in the future employing teeth of more extant and extinct lamniform sharks and it must be pointed out that this approach does not replace in any way the qualitative analysis, but it is intended to complement and support it."
https://openalex.org/W2770539102,"The identity of organelles in the endomembrane system of any eukaryotic cell critically depends on the correctly localized Rab GTPase, which binds effectors and thus promotes membrane remodeling or fusion. However, it is still unresolved which factors are required and therefore define the localization of the correct fusion machinery. Using SNARE-decorated proteoliposomes that cannot fuse on their own, we now demonstrate that full fusion activity can be achieved by just four soluble factors: a soluble SNARE (Vam7), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF, Mon1âCcz1), a RabâGDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) complex (prenylated Ypt7âGDI), and a Rab effector complex (HOPS). Our findings reveal that the GEF Mon1âCcz1 is necessary and sufficient for stabilizing prenylated Ypt7 on membranes. HOPS binding to Ypt7-GTP then drives SNARE-mediated fusion, which is fully GTP-dependent. We conclude that an entire fusion cascade can be controlled by a GEF.

We recently reported that insulitis in type 1 diabetes of mice and humans is preceded by intraislet accumulation of HA, a highly hygroscopic polymer. Using the double transgenic DO11.10 Ã RIPmOVA (DORmO) mouse model of type 1 diabetes, we asked whether autoimmune insulitis was associated with changes in the stiffness of islets. To measure islet stiffness, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) and developed a novel âbed of nailsâ-like approach that uses quartz glass nanopillars to anchor islets, solving a long-standing problem of keeping tissue-scale objects immobilized while performing AFM. We measured stiffness via AFM nanoindentation with a spherical indenter and found that insulitis made islets mechanically soft compared with controls. Conversely, treatment with 4-methylumbelliferone, a small-molecule inhibitor of HA synthesis, reduced HA accumulation, diminished swelling, and restored basal tissue stiffness. These results indicate that HA content governs the mechanical properties of islets. In hydrogels with variable HA content, we confirmed that increased HA leads to mechanically softer hydrogels, consistent with our model.

In this study, Kyn was shown to be a metabolic regulator of proinflammatory monocytes that orchestrated peripheral immune activation and neuroinflammation in depressive mice. Kyn-induced depressive behavior was paralleled by brain infiltration of proinflammatory monocytes and astrocytic activation. Kyn enhanced chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-2âmediated chemotaxis of monocytes and their proinflammatory capability on cocultured astrocytes in vitro, which involved the activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. Kyn augmented, whereas pharmacological AhR blockade rescued, systemic inflammation-induced monocyte trafficking, neuroimmune disturbance, and depressive-like behavior in mice. The behavior-exacerbating effects of the KynâAhR axis were dampened with prior depletion of functional monocytes in the periphery.

https://openalex.org/W2770890715,"In Arabidopsis, fungal chitin is recognized as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) by the chitin receptor complex containing the lysin-motif (LysM) receptor-like kinases CERK1 and LYK5. Upon the perception of chitin, CERK1 phosphorylates the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, PBL27, which activates the intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. However, the mechanisms by which the CERK1-PBL27 complex is regulated remain largely unknown. We identified ubiquitin ligase PUB12 as a component of the PBL27 complex using co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. However, PUB12 did not interact directly with PBL27. Instead, the ARM domains of PUB12 and its paralog PUB13 interacted with the intracellular domain of CERK1 in a manner that was dependent on its autophosphorylation, suggesting that the phosphorylation-based auto-activation of CERK1 may be required for its interaction with PUB12. The co-expression of PUB12 in Nicotiana benthamiana reduced the accumulation of CERK1. The pub12 pub13 mutant exhibited enhanced chitin-induced immune responses such as ROS production, MAPK activation, and callose deposition. These results suggest that PUB12 and PUB13 are involved in the negative regulation of the chitin receptor complex, which may contribute to the transient desensitization of chitin-induced responses."
https://openalex.org/W2768396957,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the gene expression differences in different stages of CRC. Gene expression data on 433 CRC patient samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Gene expression differences were evaluated across CRC stages using linear regression. Genes with pâ¤0.001 in expression differences were evaluated further in principal component analysis and genes with pâ¤0.0001 were evaluated further in gene set enrichment analysis. A total of 377 patients with gene expression data in 20,532 genes were included in the final analysis. The numbers of patients in stage I through IV were 59, 147, 116 and 55, respectively. NEK4 gene, which encodes for NIMA related kinase 4, was differentially expressed across the four stages of CRC. The stage I patients had the highest expression of NEK4 genes, while the stage IV patients had the lowest expressions (p = 9*10â6). Ten other genes (RNF34, HIST3H2BB, NUDT6, LRCh4, GLB1L, HIST2H4A, TMEM79, AMIGO2, C20orf135 and SPSB3) had p value of 0.0001 in the differential expression analysis. Principal component analysis indicated that the patients from the 4 clinical stages do not appear to have distinct gene expression pattern. Network-based and pathway-based gene set enrichment analyses showed that these 11 genes map to multiple pathways such as meiotic synapsis and packaging of telomere ends, etc. Ten of these 11 genes were linked to Gene Ontology terms such as nucleosome, DNA packaging complex and protein-DNA interactions. The protein complex-based gene set analysis showed that four genes were involved in H2AX complex II. This study identified a small number of genes that might be associated with clinical stages of CRC. Our analysis was not able to find a molecular basis for the current clinical staging for CRC based on the gene expression patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2769310401,"Epidermal growth factor-like repeats and discoidin I-like domain 3 (Edil3) is an extracellular matrix protein containing an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif that binds integrin. Recently, Edil3 has been implicated in various biological processes, including angiogenesis and cellular differentiation. It can inhibit inflammatory bone destruction. The objective of this study was to explore the role of Edil3 in osteoblast differentiation and its underlying molecular mechanisms. In wild-type mice, high expression levels of Edil3 mRNA were observed in isolated calvaria and tibia/femur bones. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Edil3 protein was localized along periosteum and calcified regions surrounding bone tissues. When murine calvaria-derived MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in osteogenic medium containing 50 Î¼g/ml ascorbic acid and 5 mM Î²-glycerophosphate, Edil3 mRNA and protein expression levels were increased. Treatment with Edil3 protein in growth media increased expression levels of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin gene and phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Edil3 treatment with osteogenic medium induced mineralization. Treatment with a neutralizing antibody against Î±5Î²1 and MEK inhibitor U0126 inhibited Edil3-enhanced osteogenic marker gene expression and mineral deposition.

However, the role of germ cells in BTB assembly remains unclear. Herein, KitW/KitWV mice were used as a study model. These mice were infertile, failing to establish a functional BTB to support meiosis due to c-Kit mutation. Transplantation of undifferentiated spermatogonia derived from normal mice into the testis of KitW/KitWV mice triggered functional BTB assembly, displaying cyclic remodeling during the epithelial cycle. Also, transplanted germ cells were capable of inducing Leydig cell testosterone production, which could enhance the expression of integral membrane protein claudin 3 in Sertoli cells. Early spermatocytes were shown to play a vital role in directing BTB assembly by expressing claudin 3, which likely created a transient adhesion structure to mediate BTB and cytoskeleton assembly in adjacent Sertoli cells. In summary, the positive modulation of germ cells on somatic cell function provides useful information regarding somatic-germ cell interactions.-Li, X.-Y., Zhang, Y., Wang, X.-X., Jin, C., Wang, Y.-Q., Sun, T.-C., Li, J., Tang, J.-X., Batool, A., Deng, S.-L., Chen, S.-R., Cheng, C.

https://openalex.org/W2768483620,"Broken water pumps continue to impede efforts to deliver clean and economically-viable water to the global poor. The literature has demonstrated that customers' health benefits and willingness to pay for clean water are best realized when clean water infrastructure performs extremely well (>99% uptime). In this paper, we used sensor data from 42 Afridev-brand handpumps observed for 14 months in western Kenya to demonstrate how sensors and supervised ensemble machine learning could be used to increase total fleet uptime from a best-practices baseline of about 70% to >99%. We accomplish this increase in uptime by forecasting pump failures and identifying existing failures very quickly. Comparing the costs of operating the pump per functional year over a lifetime of 10 years, we estimate that implementing this algorithm would save 7% on the levelized cost of water relative to a sensor-less scheduled maintenance program. Combined with a rigorous system for dispatching maintenance personnel, implementing this algorithm in a real-world program could significantly improve health outcomes and customers' willingness to pay for water services."

Translation requires the interplay of several RNA hybridization processes, which are expected to be temperature-sensitive. We used ribosome profiling to monitor translation in Escherichia coli at 30 Â°C and to investigate how this changes after 10â20 min of heat shock at 42 Â°C. Translation efficiencies are robustly maintained after thermal heat shock and after mimicking the heat-shock response transcriptional program at 30 Â°C by overexpressing the heat shock Ï factor encoded by the rpoH gene. We compared translation efficiency, the ratio of ribosome footprint reads to mRNA reads for each gene, to parameters derived from gene sequences. Genes with stable mRNA structures, non-optimal codon use, and those whose gene product is cotranslationally translocated into the inner membrane are generally less highly translated than other genes. Comparison with other published datasets suggests a role for translational elongation in coupling mRNA structures to translation initiation. Genome-wide calculations of the temperature dependence of mRNA structure predict that relatively few mRNAs show a melting transition between 30 and 42 Â°C, consistent with the observed lack of changes in translation efficiency.

Here we analyzed the impact of miR205 ectopic expression in the initial tumorigenic processes of SUM159PT, a triple negative breast cancer cell line with low endogenous levels of miR205. In SUM159PT, miR205 inhibited expression of its targets VEGFA, ErbB3, Zeb1, Fyn and Lyn A/B; it reduced cell proliferation, and Myc/cyclin D1 levels, while increased p27kip1 expression. miR205 abolished anchorage-independent growth, inhibited migration and invasion, Src-kinases/Stat3 axis activation, and levels of secreted MMP9. miR205 also reduced expression of CD44 and TAZ, E2A.E12, Twist, Snail1 and CK5, associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Importantly, we show that miR205 inhibited SUM159PT cancer-stem cell renewal, expression in mammospheres of CD44 and ALDH1 stem-cell markers, TAZ, and E2A.E12. All these effects of miR205 were reverted by Anti-miR205 co-expression, demonstrating its specificity. Thus, all these results strongly suggest that ectopic expression of miR205 in SUM159PT affected several parameters associated with initial steps of tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2770297849,"Modification by the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO affects hundreds of cellular substrate proteins and regulates a wide variety of physiological processes. While the SUMO system appears to predominantly target nuclear proteins and, to a lesser extent, cytosolic proteins, hardly anything is known about the SUMOylation of proteins targeted to membrane-enclosed organelles. Here, we identify a large set of structurally and functionally unrelated mitochondrial proteins as substrates of the SUMO pathway in yeast. We show that SUMO modification of mitochondrial proteins does not rely on mitochondrial targeting and, in fact, is strongly enhanced upon import failure, consistent with the modification occurring in the cytosol. Moreover, SUMOylated forms of mitochondrial proteins particularly accumulate in HSP70- and proteasome-deficient cells, suggesting that SUMOylation participates in cellular protein quality control. We therefore propose that SUMO serves as a mark for nonfunctional mitochondrial proteins, which only sporadically arise in unstressed cells but strongly accumulate upon defective mitochondrial import and impaired proteostasis.

Interestingly, SUMO substrates in the cytosol also include proteins that are located at the interfaces of the plasma membrane and cellular organelles such as the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria (13Geiss-Friedlander R.

This group of substrates includes the GTPase DRP1 in mammals, which currently is the only well-characterized SUMO substrate that localizes to mitochondria. DRP1 associates with the cytosolic side of the outer mitochondrial membrane. SUMOylation of DRP1 was found to be mediated by the mitochondrial anchored SUMO E3 ligase MAPL (21Braschi E. Zunino R.

Starting from a mass spectrometry (MS) approach, we provide here evidence that a substantial fraction of the mitochondrial proteome is targeted by the SUMO modification system. We corroborate our MS data by individually confirming the SUMO modification of several mitochondrial matrix proteins in vivo. In agreement with the presence of SUMO enzymes in the cytosol but not in the mitochondrial matrix, we find that the SUMOylation of mitochondrial proteins does not rely on mitochondrial import. By contrast, our data rather indicate that SUMOylation of mitochondrial proteins is strongly enhanced upon import failure. Moreover, whereas SUMO modification of these substrates occurs only sporadically in unstressed cells, it is particularly induced when canonical components of the proteostasis network, such as the HSP70 system or the proteasome, are defective. Finally, we propose a model in which the SUMO modification pathway targets nonfunctional mitochondrial proteins as an element of cellular protein quality control. Following our long-standing interest in the SUMO system, we screened for novel SUMO substrates using a strategy that involves the purification of His-tagged SUMO (HisSUMO) conjugates from yeast cells and analysis of the enriched proteins using quantitative mass spectrometry (37Psakhye I.

Notably, we consistently identified peptides of several different mitochondrial proteins in our HisSUMO purifications. By compiling the results of multiple MS experiments, our approach revealed a set of 89 inner mitochondrial proteins as potential SUMO substrates (Table S1). For 61 of these proteins we also identified a total of 81 SUMOylation sites, further suggesting that these proteins are modified in vivo (Table S1). Among the 89 potential mitochondrial SUMO substrates, we found components of all inner mitochondrial subcompartments (intermembrane space, inner membrane, and matrix) (Fig. 1A). A comparison with the localization of known mitochondrial proteins listed in the Yeast Deletion and Proteomics of Mitochondria (YDPM) database (39Prokisch H. Scharfe C. Camp 2nd, D.G. Xiao W.

Seemingly, therefore, submitochondrial localization is not a determinant for SUMO modification. Importantly, only a small fraction of substrates (six proteins) were annotated as having a dual localization (mitochondrial and cytosolic). We therefore conclude that a large number of proteins that function in mitochondria are modified by SUMO in vivo. To ascertain the MS results, we analyzed the SUMOylation of several structurally and functionally unrelated mitochondrial proteins individually. Using denaturing Ni-NTA pulldowns and subsequent Western blot analysis we were able to confirm that these mitochondrial matrix proteins are indeed modified by SUMO. These confirmed SUMO substrates include Ilv6 (Fig. 1B), a protein involved in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis (40Cullin C. Baudin-Baillieu A. Guillemet E. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O.

We next aimed to identify the SUMO acceptor sites on mitochondrial SUMO substrates. To this end, we systematically replaced individual lysine residues on Ilv6, Adh3, and Mrpl23 to arginine. For Ilv6, this identified lysine 260 as major SUMO acceptor site (Fig. S1, A and B), but additional removal of three adjacent lysine residues (Lys-218, Lys-284, and Lys-296) in a stepwise manner further reduced SUMOylation and a mutant variant lacking all four lysine residues (Ilv63HA-K218R, K260R, K284R, K296R termed Ilv63HA-4KR) did not show any detectable SUMOylation (Fig. S1, A and B). For Adh3, we found lysine 305 as major SUMO acceptor site (Fig. S1, C and D) and for Mrpl23, replacement of the two most C-terminal lysine residues by arginine reduced the levels of SUMO conjugates to less than 50% (Fig. S1, E and F). We next asked whether SUMOylation of mitochondrial proteins requires specific SUMO E3 ligases. Analysis of Ilv6 SUMOylation in cells lacking the known SUMO E3 ligases Siz1 (siz1Î) or Siz2 (siz2Î) indicated that the SUMO modification of Ilv6 is catalyzed by Siz1 and to a minor extent by Siz2 (Fig. 2A). Accordingly, Ilv6 SUMOylation was undetectable by Western blotting in samples from cells lacking both Siz1 and Siz2 (siz1Î siz2Î) (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we found strikingly similar roles for Siz1 and Siz2 in the SUMO modification of Adh3 (Fig. 2B) and Mrpl23 (Fig. 2C). Thus, all tested SUMO substrates require the same SUMO E3 ligases of the conserved Siz/PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) family for modification. The vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes and subsequently imported into mitochondria (45Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Translocation of proteins into mitochondria.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76 (17263664): 723-74910.1146/annurev.biochem.76.052705.163409Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 46Chacinska A.

We therefore asked whether SUMOylation of mitochondrial proteins is linked to the import process or requires the presence of a mitochondrial targeting signal. Classical mitochondrial targeting signals are N-terminal presequences, which in most cases are proteolytically removed from mitochondrial precursor proteins during import. Presequences frequently target proteins into the mitochondrial matrix and therefore are also referred to as matrix-targeting sequences (MTS) (45Neupert W. Herrmann J.M. Translocation of proteins into mitochondria.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76 (17263664): 723-74910.1146/annurev.biochem.76.052705.163409Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we generated an Ilv6 mutant variant (MTSÎ-Ilv63HA), which lacks the N-terminal MTS (amino acids 1â24) required for mitochondrial import (Fig. 3A). Microscopic analysis of corresponding GFP fusion proteins demonstrated that removal of the 24 N-terminal amino acids of Ilv6 is indeed sufficient to prevent mitochondrial import, thereby causing a presumably cytosolic localization of the mutant protein variant (Fig. S2, A and B). Importantly, this mutant was efficiently SUMOylated (Fig. 3B) and the modification was again dependent on the SUMO E3 ligases Siz1 and Siz2 (Fig. S2C) and occurred at a similar set of SUMO acceptor sites as for wild-type Ilv6 (Fig. S2D). Therefore, SUMO modification of Ilv6 does not rely on mitochondrial import and does not require the presence of an MTS. In fact, MTS deletion even strongly enhanced the SUMOylation of Ilv6 (Fig. 3B), indicating that SUMO modification is induced by import failure. We also analyzed an import-incompetent variant of Adh3 (MTSÎ-Adh33HA) (Fig. 3C). Again, SUMO modification of the import-incompetent variant was enhanced compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, SUMOylation of import-incompetent Adh3 also required the SUMO E3 ligases Siz1 and Siz2 (Fig. S2E) and the predominantly targeted lysine 305 (Fig. S2F), similar to wild-type Adh3. We therefore conclude that import-incompetent mutant variants of mitochondrial proteins are SUMOylated with requirements as wild-type substrates, but that deletion of targeting sequences strongly enhances the modification. This may suggest that SUMOylation of wild-type proteins specifically occurs upon sporadic mistargeting in unstressed cells and under conditions where mitochondrial protein import is impaired. Indeed, we observed an accumulation of SUMOylated Ilv6 precursors (p) in strains defective in mitochondrial import (Fig. 3E), which harbor a temperature-sensitive mutant variant of mitochondrial HSP70 (ssc1-3) (47Gambill B.D. Voos W. Kang P.J. Miao B. Langer T. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. A dual role for mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 in membrane translocation of preproteins.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123 (8408191): 109-11710.1083/jcb.123.1.109Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we specifically observed the accumulation of SUMOylated Ilv6 precursors in the ssc1-3 mutant, whereas in wild-type cells Ilv6-SUMO conjugates appeared to be proteolytically processed (Fig. 3E; note the shift of the precursor (p) compared with the mature form (m)). This indicates that the major pool of Ilv6-SUMO conjugates in unstressed wild-type cells possesses a proteolytically processed N terminus. It is therefore conceivable that these protein species have at some point initiated mitochondrial import, but that they become modified by SUMO in the cytosol. Based on our observation that the SUMOylation of mitochondrial proteins can occur in the cytosol, we speculated that the modification might be affected by factors which bind nonimported mitochondrial precursor proteins. Several factors are involved in posttranslational protein import into mitochondria (48Mihara K. Omura T.

https://openalex.org/W2769481548,"CD1d-deficiency results in a selective deletion of NKT cells in mice that is reported to prevent murine allergic airway disease (AAD). Because we find 2â3 fold lower basal IL-4 production in CD1d- mice than in wild-type (WT) mice, we hypothesized that the contribution made by NKT cells to AAD would depend on the strength of the stimulus used to induce the disease. Consequently, we compared CD1d-deficient mice to WT mice in the development of AAD, using several models of disease induction that differed in the type and dose of allergen, the site of sensitization and the duration of immunization. Surprisingly we found equivalent allergic inflammation and airway disease in WT and CD1d- mice in all models investigated. Consistent with this, NKT cells constituted only ~2% of CD4+ T cells in the lungs of mice with AAD, and IL-4-transcribing NKT cells did not expand with disease induction. Concerned that the congenital absence of NKT cells might have caused a compensatory shift within the immune response, we administered an anti-CD1d monoclonal Ab (mAb) to block NKT function before airway treatments, before or after systemic sensitization to antigen. Such Ab treatment did not affect disease severity. We suggest that the differences reported in the literature regarding the significance of NKT cells in the induction of allergic airway disease may have less to do with the methods used to study the disease and more to do with the animals themselves and/or the facilities used to house them."

Frequent insulin secretion exposes ZnT8 to the cell surface, but the humoral antigenicity of the surface-displayed ZnT8 remains unknown. Here we show that a membrane-embedded human ZnT8 antigen triggered a vigorous immune response in ZnT8 knock-out mice. Approximately 50% of serum immunoreactivities toward ZnT8 were mapped to its transmembrane domain that is accessible to extracellular ZnT8 antibody (ZnT8A). ZnT8A binding was detected on live rat insulinoma INS-1E cells, and the binding specificity was validated by a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated ZnT8 knock-out. Applying established ZnT8A assays to purified serum antibodies from patients with type 1 diabetes, we detected human ZnT8A bound to live INS-1E cells, whereas a ZnT8 knock-out specifically reduced the surface binding. Our results demonstrate that ZnT8 is a cell surface self-antigen, raising the possibility of a direct involvement in antibody-mediated Î²-cell dysfunction and cytotoxicity."

Using mark-recapture techniques with fluorescent printer's ink, we identified a class of workers that ranges widely within the vertical structure of the nest, rapidly moving materials dropped by foragers in the upper regions downward, and excavated soil from deeper upward. Within the nest, only 5% of foragers were recovered below 20 cm depth, but about 30% of transfer workers and 82% of unmarked workers were found there. Below 70 cm depth, 90% of workers were unmarked, and were probably involved mostly in brood care. During the summer, the transfer workers comprise about a quarter of the nest population, while foragers make up about 40%. Workers marked as transfer workers later appear as foragers, while those marked as foragers die and disappear from the foraging population, suggesting that transfer workers are younger, and age into foraging. The importance of these findings for laboratory studies of division of labor are discussed. The efficient allocation of labor is a key component of superorganismal fitness."

https://openalex.org/W2770312877,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as an important cause of lower and upper respiratory tract infections in older adults, and a successful vaccine would substantially lower morbidity and mortality in this age group. Recently, two vaccine candidates based on soluble purified glycoprotein F (RSV F), either alone or adjuvanted with glucopyranosyl lipid A formulated in a stable emulsion (GLA-SE), failed to reach their primary endpoints in clinical efficacy studies, despite demonstrating the desired immunogenicity profile and efficacy in young rodent models. Here, one of the RSV F vaccine candidates (post-fusion conformation, RSV post-F), and a stabilized pre-fusion form of RSV F (RSV pre-F, DS-Cav1) were evaluated in aged BALB/c mice. Humoral and cellular immunogenicity elicited after immunization of naÃ¯ve, aged mice was generally lower compared to young animals. In aged mice, RSV post-F vaccination without adjuvant poorly protected the respiratory tract from virus replication, and addition of GLA-SE only improved protection in the lungs, but not in nasal turbinates. RSV pre-F induced higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to RSV post-F (as previously reported) but interestingly, RSV F-specific CD8 T cell responses were lower compared to RSV post-F responses regardless of age. The vaccines were also tested in RSV seropositive aged mice, in which both antigen forms similarly boosted neutralizing antibody titers, although GLA-SE addition boosted neutralizing activity only in RSV pre-F immunized animals. Cell-mediated immune responses in the aged mice were only slightly boosted and well below levels induced in seronegative young mice. Taken together, the findings suggest that the vaccine candidates were not able to induce a strong anti-RSV immune response in recipient mice with an aged immune system, in agreement with recent human clinical trial results. Therefore, the aged mouse model could be a useful tool to evaluate improved vaccine candidates, targeted to prevent RSV disease in older adults."

Among the KANK1 binding partners, KIF21A is of special interest because it is a member of the kinesin-4 family and possesses the plus-endâdirected motor activity (18Hirokawa N. Noda Y. Tanaka Y.

In addition, the mutations of KIF21A lead to congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles type 1, a neurological disease (19Yamada K. Andrews C. Chan W.M. McKeown C.A. Magli A. de Berardinis T.

KIF21A consists of an N-terminal kinesin domain, a middle coiled-coil region, and a C-terminal WD40 domain (18Hirokawa N. Noda Y. Tanaka Y. Niwa S.

The molecular mechanism of the recognition of KIF21A by the KANK1 ankyrin domain remains elusive. As one of the most versatile protein-protein binding modules, ankyrin repeats are usually formed by linear arrays of tandem copies of a 30â40-aa motif (20Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J.

To understand how the KANK1 ankyrin domain recognizes KIF21A and whether other KANK family members also possesses KIF21A-binding ability, we mapped the KANK1-binding motif in KIF21A and determined the crystal structures of the KIF21A peptide in complex with either the ankyrin domain of KANK1 or the ankyrin domain of KANK2. By structural analysis, mutagenesis, and biochemical experiments, we identified the key residues of KIF21A and KANK1/2 involved in the complex formation. Overall, our work not only uncovers the common KIF21A recognition mode by KANK1 and KANK2 but also reflects a broader understanding of the roles of KANK1 in clustering the cortical complex to inhibit outgrowth of MTs. KANK1 contains several unique functional domains and has been found to associate with a stretch of a â¼40-aa motif (residues 1142â1180) of KIF21A via its C-terminal ankyrin domain (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A) (7van der Vaart B. van Riel W.E.

We further narrow down the KANK1-binding site (KBS) in KIF21A to a â¼30-aa motif (residues 1137â1167) by a GST pull-down and Western blot experiment (Fig. 1B). Next we synthesized two peptides of KIF21A, 1138â1160 and 1146â1167, respectively, and tested their binding to the KANK1 ankyrin domain (residues 1080â1329) by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) binding experiments (Fig. S1B). We found that 1146â1167 of KIF21A, but not 1138â1160 of KIF21A, displayed KANK1-binding affinity, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.2 Î¼m (Fig. S1B and Table S1). We synthesized 1142â1167 of KIF21A and found that it bound to KANK1 only slightly stronger (Kd = 1.0 Î¼m) (Fig. S2B and Table S1). KANK1 and KANK2 display similar domain organization, and their C-terminal ankyrin domains are highly homologous (>55% sequence identity) (Fig. S1A), which prompted us to test the binding of the KANK2 ankyrin domain (residues 578â832) to different KIF21A peptides. ITC binding data showed that the KANK2 ankyrin domain also bound to 1142â1167 and 1146â1167 of KIF21A, but not 1138â1160 of KIF21A, with Kd values of 0.5 and 1.0 Î¼m, respectively (Fig. S1C and Table S1). Overall, our binding data indicated that 1146â1167 of KIF21A is sufficient for binding to the ankyrin domains of KANK1 and KANK2 (Fig. 2, A and B).Figure 2KIF21A(1146â1167) is sufficient for binding to KANK1/2 and overall structures of the KANK1/2 ankyrin domains with the KIF21A peptide.

Finally, we successfully solved the crystal structure of the human KANK1 domain alone and in complex with the KIF21A peptide at 2.34 and 1.89 â« resolutions, respectively (Fig. 2 (C and D) and Table 1). We found that the structure of the ankyrin domain of KANK1 consists of one non-canonical ankyrin repeat (ANK0) and five canonical ankyrin repeats (ANK1â5), with folds of ANK1â5 characteristic of previously determined ankyrin structures (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1A) (22Xu C.

Three extra helices at the N terminus of the KANK1 ankyrin domain, two preceding ANK0 (Î±1-Î±2) and one between ANK0 and ANK1 (Î±5), pack with ANK0 (Î±3-Î±4) to form a tight helix bundle (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1A).

Open table in a new tab By comparing the apo-structure of the KANK1 ankyrin domain and that of the KANK1-KIF21A complex, we found that the structure of KANK1 did not change much upon KIF21A binding, with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the CÎ± atoms of the two KANK1 structures only 0.72 â« (calculated by PyMOL). In the KANK1-KIF21A complex structure, 1152â1166 of the KIF21A peptide were modeled into electron density, whereas 1146â1151 and 1167 of KIF21A were not visible (Fig. S2A). The KIF21A peptide binds to the inner groove of the KANK1 ankyrin domain constituted by the inner helix and the inter-repeat linkers of ANK1â5 (Fig. 1E). Unexpectedly, one 310-helix (1153ARR1155) and one Î±-helix (1160QMELL1164) are formed at the N- and C-terminal ends of the KIF21A peptide, respectively. The two helices, designated as hA and hB, respectively, are connected by a short linker (1156RTTT1159) (Fig. 2D). By CD spectroscopy, we found that the conformation of the KIF21A peptide alone lacks regular secondary structures (Fig. S3), thereby confirming that helical conformation of the KIF21A peptide was induced upon KANK1 binding. The KIF21A peptide was recognized by the KANK1 ankyrin domain via an acidic patch and a hydrophobic groove, designated as P1 and P2, respectively (Fig. 3). hA is recognized specifically by P1 and hB by P2, whereas the linker connecting hA and hB only makes few contacts with KANK1 (Fig. 3). The N terminus of the KIF21A peptide (1152KARR1155) is fitted into the acidic patch (P1) of KANK1 and interacts with ANK3â5 of KANK1 primarily via electrostatic interactions (Fig. 2D). Specifically, the side chain of the KIF21A Lys1152 is hydrogen-bonded to Asp1300 of KANK1 (Fig. 3). The backbone amide and carbonyl groups of the KIF21A Ala1153 form one direct hydrogen bond with Glu1266 of KANK1 and one water-mediated hydrogen bond with Ser1243 of KANK1, respectively. Ala1153 of KIF21A also makes hydrophobic contacts with Ala1233 of KANK1 (Fig. 3 and Figs. S2B and S4). The side chain of the KIF21A Arg1154 is accommodated into a negatively changed pocket KANK1 by forming several intermolecular hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Ser1268, Glu1276, and Asp1298. Arg1155 of KIF21A is further hydrogen-bonded to Glu1276 and His1277 of KANK1 (Fig. 3 and Figs. S2B and S4). The C terminus of KIF21A, including hB, binds to the hydrophobic groove (P2) of the KANK1 ankyrin domain formed by ANK1â3 (Figs. 2D and 3). Specifically, Leu1163 of KIF21A is accommodated into the hydrophobic pocket composed of Tyr1197, Leu1202, Leu1205, and Leu1240 of KANK1. Leu1164 of KIF21A makes hydrophobic contact with Tyr1168 and Leu1202 of the KANK1 (Fig. 3 and Figs. S2B and S4). Additional intermolecular hydrophobic interactions are also found between Lys1194 and Ala1195 of KANK1 and Ala-1166 of KIF21A (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). Intramolecular hydrophobic interactions within KIF21A, such as those between Met1161, Leu1164, and Tyr1165, stabilize the peptide conformation (Fig. 3). In addition to the hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds are also involved in the interactions between the C terminus of KIF21A and P2 of KANK1 (Figs. S2B and S4). The side chain of Gln1160 of KIF21A forms one direct hydrogen bond and one water-mediated hydrogen bond, with the backbone carbonyl group of Leu1205 of KANK1 and the side chain of Ser1173 of KANK1, respectively (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). The backbone carbonyl group of Gln1160 of KIF21A also forms one water-mediated hydrogen bond with the side chain of Ser1173 of KANK1 (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). The backbone carbonyl groups of Leu1163 and Leu1164 of KIF21A are hydrogen-bonded to the side chains of Asn1193 and Asn1163 of KANK1, respectively (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). In contrast to hA and hB, the linker region of the KIF21A peptide (1156RTTT1159) only makes few contacts with the periphery region of the acidic patch of the KANK1 ankyrin domain (L) (Fig. 3). The side chain of Arg1156 of KIF21A points to the solvent and forms intramolecular hydrogen bonds with Glu1162 of KIF21A. The side chains of Thr1157 and Thr1159 of KIF21A also point to the solvent (Fig. 3). Thr1158 of KIF21A, which is hydrogen-bonded to His1244 of KANK1 and contacts Leu1205 and Leu1240 of KANK1 via hydrophobic interactions, is the only buried linker residue (Fig. 3 and Fig. S4). Collectively, the coordinated recognition of N- and C-terminal sequences of the KIF21A peptide by P1 and P2 pockets of KANK1 constitutes the unusual ankyrin-peptide recognition mode. By aligning the sequence of the KIF21A peptide across species, we identified several residues that are absolutely conserved from C. elegans to humans, including Lys1152, Arg1154, Arg1155, Thr1157, Leu1163, and Leu1164 (Fig. 3). All of them interact with KANK1 directly except Thr1157, which is a putative phosphorylation site (https://www.phosphosite.org/proteinAction.action?id=14693) 5Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site.

We constructed two single mutants of the KIF21A peptide, R1154A and L1164A, and tested their binding to KANK1. We found by ITC that the mutants displayed no binding or very weak binding affinity toward the KANK1 ankyrin domain (Fig. 4A and Table S1). To verify the importance of the KANK1 residues in recognizing KIF21A, we chose to mutate Tyr1197, Asp1298, and Asp1300 because Asp1298 and Asp1300 of KANK1 constitute P1, and Tyr1197 is the P2 pocket residue (Fig. 2). We constructed D1298A, D1300A, Y1197A, and Y1197L and tested their KIF21A-binding affinities by ITC. The binding data show that Y1197A, D1298A, and D1300A diminished the KIF21A binding by â¼4.5-, â¼15-, and 10-fold, respectively (Fig. 4B). We further made the double mutant D1298A/D1300A and found that it displayed very weak binding affinity toward the KIF21A peptide (Kd > 200 Î¼m) (Fig. 4B and Table S1). Y1197L also decreased the KIF21A binding severely (Kd > 200 Î¼m) because replacement of Tyr1197 with a Leu in KANK1 would change the depth of the hydrophobic pocket and lead to close contacts with Leu1163 of KIF21A (Fig. 3). Together, the mutagenesis and binding experiments demonstrate that both P1 and P2 of the KANK1 ankyrin domain are required for binding to KIF21A. To investigate whether other KANK members also recognize KIF21A in a way similar to that observed in the KANK1-KIF21A complex, we further determined the 2.12 â« complex structure of the KANK2 ankyrin domain with the same KIF21A peptide (Table 1). Region 1146â1167 of KIF21A, which also adopts a helix-linker-helix conformation, was built in the KANK2-KIF21A complex (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2 (C and D)). Overall, the conformations of protein and peptide are quite similar in two complexes, with an RMSD of 0.92 â« over 244 pairs of aligned protein CÎ± atoms and an RMSD of 0.38 â« over 15 pairs of peptide CÎ± atoms (calculated by PyMOL) (Fig. S5). Superposition of the two complexes showed that the KANK2 ankyrin domain only slightly differs from that of KANK1 at the N terminus. KANK2 contains only one longer helix (Î±1) preceding its ANK0 repeat and does not contain Î±2, as existing in KANK1. Of note, Î±2 of KANK1 is not involved in the interaction with KIF21A (Fig. S5). Most of the intermolecular interactions between KANK1 and KIF21A, including hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, are observed between corresponding residues of KANK2 and KIF21A (Fig. S2D), which prompted us to test whether the KANK2 ankyrin domain displays a binding property similar to that of the KANK1 ankyrin domain. We first tested the binding of KANK2 to the mutated peptide by ITC and found that R1154A bound to KANK2 very weakly (Kd > 200 Î¼m), whereas L1164A does not display KANK2-binding affinity (Fig. 4C and Table S1). Because Tyr702, Asp803, and Asp805 of KANK2 correspond to Tyr1197, Asp1298, and Asp1300 of KANK1, respectively, we made several single"
https://openalex.org/W2768298222,"Polysialic acid (polySia) is a large glycan polymer that is added to some glycoproteins by two polysialyltransferases (polySTs), ST8Sia-II and ST8Sia-IV. As polySia modulates cell adhesion and signaling, immune cell function, and tumor metastasis, it is of interest to determine how the polySTs recognize their select substrates. We have recently identified residues within the ST8Sia-IV polybasic region (PBR) that are required for neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) recognition and subsequent polysialylation. Here, we compared the PBR sequence requirements for NCAM, neuropilin-2 (NRP-2), and synaptic cell adhesion molecule 1 (SynCAM 1) for polysialylation by their respective polySTs. We found that the polySTs use unique but overlapping sets of PBR residues for substrate recognition, that the NCAM-recognizing PBR sites in ST8Sia-II and ST8Sia-IV include homologous residues, but that the ST8Sia-II site is larger, and that fewer PBR residues are involved in NRP-2 and SynCAM 1 recognition than in NCAM recognition. Noting that the two sites for ST8Sia-IV autopolysialylation flank the PBR, we evaluated the role of PBR residues in autopolysialylation and found that the requirements for polyST autopolysialylation and substrate polysialylation overlap. These data together with the evaluation of the polyST autopolysialylation mechanism enabled us to further identify PBR residues potentially playing dual roles in substrate recognition and in polySia chain polymerization. Finally, we found that ST8Sia-IV autopolysialylation is required for NRP-2 polysialylation and that ST8Sia-II autopolysialylation promotes the polymerization of longer polySia chains on SynCAM 1, suggesting a critical role for polyST autopolysialylation in substrate selection and polySia chain elongation."

To regulate signal transmission, connexin (Cx) channel permeability must respond dynamically to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. One key stimulus is intracellular pH (pHi), which is modulated by a tissue's metabolic and perfusion status. Our understanding of the molecular mechanism of H+ gating of Cx43 channelsâthe major isoform in the heart and brainâis incomplete. To interrogate the effects of acidic and alkaline pHi on Cx43 channels, we combined voltage-clamp electrophysiology with pHi imaging and photolytic H+ uncaging, performed over a range of pHi values. We demonstrate that Cx43 channels expressed in HeLa or N2a cell pairs are gated biphasically by pHi via a process that consists of activation by H+ ions at alkaline pHi and inhibition at more acidic pHi. For Cx43 channel-mediated solute/ion transmission, the ensemble of these effects produces a pHi optimum, near resting pHi. By using Cx43 mutants, we demonstrate that alkaline gating involves cysteine residues of the C terminus and is independent of motifs previously implicated in acidic gating. Thus, we present a molecular mechanism by which cytoplasmic acidâbase chemistry fine tunes intercellular communication and establishes conditions for the optimal transmission of solutes and signals in tissues, such as the heart and brain.â Garciarena, C.

Although many studies have been conducted on the origin of dogs, the existing literature about the ancestry, diversity, and population structure of Korean dogs is sparse. Therefore, this study is focused on the origin, diversity and population structure of Korean dogs. The study sample comprised four major categories, including non-dogs (coyotes and wolves), ancient, modern and Korean dogs. Selected samples were genotyped using an Illumina CanineHD array containing 173,662 single nucleotide polymorphisms. The genome-wide data were filtered using quality control parameters in PLINK 1.9. Only autosomal chromosomes were used for further analysis. The negative off-diagonal variance of the genetic relationship matrix analysis depicted, the variability of samples in each population. FIS (inbreeding rate within a population) values indicated, a low level of inbreeding within populations, and the patterns were in concordance with the results of Neiâs genetic distance analysis. The lowest FST (inbreeding rate between populations) values among Korean and Chinese breeds, using a phylogenetic tree, multi-dimensional scaling, and a TreeMix likelihood tree showed Korean breeds are highly related to Chinese breeds. The Korean breeds possessed a unique and large diversity of admixtures compared with other breeds. The highest and lowest effective population sizes were observed in Korean Jindo Black (485) and Korean Donggyeong White (109), respectively. The historical effective population size of all Korean dogs showed declining trend from the past to present. It is important to take immediate action to protect the Korean dog population while conserving their diversity. Furthermore, this study suggests that Korean dogs have unique diversity and are one of the basal lineages of East Asian dogs, originating from China."

The present study aimed at comparing the diagnostic performance of two POC cTn assays with that of a central laboratory high-sensitivity (hs) method, under routine ED conditions. In 2,163 non-selected ED patients suspected for MI, the diagnostic performance of the POC troponin I (TnI), troponin T (TnT), and hs-TnT assay for the prediction of MI was evaluated based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses and compared with the performance based on the manufacturers' cut-offs. Due to an observed association between renal function as determined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and cTn concentrations, all analyses were stratified by renal function. In patients with normal renal function (eGFR > 60 mL/min/1.73m2), POC and hs assays showed a comparable diagnostic performance as quantified by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of about 0.88. The ROC-derived optimal cut-off (OCO) levels for the different cTn assays clearly changed with decreasing kidney function. Impaired kidney function required OCO to be three to five times higher to achieve a comparable performance. Particularly cTnT concentrations were strongly associated with renal function. The three cTn assays demonstrated equivalent diagnostic performance in ED-patients admitted with suspected ACS in relation to the release diagnosis, supporting the use of POC testing in this setting. The present results implicate that application of eGFR-specific OCOs may decrease false-positives among patients with impaired renal function. Providing individual cut-offs depending on patients' eGFR might be an appropriate add-on tool to improve specificity in the diagnosis of MI."
https://openalex.org/W2770519940,"Sympatric divergent populations of the same species provide an opportunity to study the evolution and maintenance of reproductive isolation. Male mating calls are important in sexual selection in acoustically communicating species, and they also have the potential to maintain isolation among species or incipient species. We studied divergent south Indian populations of the bush cricket Mecopoda elongata which are extremely difficult to distinguish morphologically, but which exhibit striking divergence in male acoustic signals. We performed phonotactic experiments investigating the relative preference of females of the âChirperâ song type for calls of all 5 of the song types found in the region (in varying degrees of sympatry). We found that Chirper females preferred their own song type and were completely unresponsive to three trilling song types. Chirper females were occasionally attracted to the call type âDouble Chirperâ (the call most similar to their own type), suggesting call preference alone cannot provide a complete isolating mechanism. To investigate the basis of call preference we investigated the response of chirper females to variation in chirp rate. Chirper females responded most frequently to a mean chirp rate characteristic of their own song type rather than a higher chirp rate which would be more characteristic of the Double-Chirper song type. This suggests females drive stabilising selection on male chirp rate, which may contribute to the maintenance of isolation. Finally, a no-choice mating experiment using Chirper females and Chirper and Double Chirper males revealed a significant preference of Chirper females to mate with their own song type, even without a requirement for phonotaxis. Overall, the strong specificity of Chirper females for their âownâ song type provides evidence for behavioural isolation among divergent sympatric Mecopoda song types being maintained by female preference for both male song type and subsequent mating probability driven by other cues."

The lymphatic system has been proposed to have a significant role in the reverse cholesterol transport pathway associated with HDL-ApoA-I. In conditions of insulin resistance (IR), there is intestinal overproduction of chylomicrons containing ApoB48; how- ever, there is limited data on the intestinal synthesis and secretion of HDL-ApoA-I. microRNA (miR)-223 has been shown to regulate peripheral HDL metabolism and may impact intestinal-derived HDL. Niacin (nicotinic acid; vitamin B3) is known to regulate lipid metabolism, but the role of niacin in modulating intestinal lipid and lipoprotein (ApoB48 and ApoA-I) metabolism is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the secretion of intestinal lymphatic HDL-ApoA-I and the effect of dietary intervention with niacin on these pathways in a rodent model of IR. HDL was isolated from intestinal mesenteric lymph by density ultracentrifugation, and subsequent HDL miR analysis was developed in collaboration with Exiqon Services. Insulin-resistant rodents were fed chow or chow with niacin (1% w/w) for 6 wk. Intestinal lymph HDL-ApoA-I and miR-223 expression were lower by atleast 45 and 60%, respectively, and lymph HDL was associated with 85% higher triglyceride (TG) content in IR compared to non-IR control group. Niacin was found to increase secretion of lymph HDL and miR-223 by at least 50-60% and to deplete the TGs associated with HDL compared with the nontreated IR group. Niacin significantly increased peroxisome proliferator-activating nuclear receptor a and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I a mRNA and annulled Tnf-Î± mRNA expression in intestinal (jejunal) explants.

IL-10 inhibits miR-155 induction by toll-like receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (20435894): 20492-2049810.1074/jbc.M110.102111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Similarly, the IL-10 pathway might enable the virus to evade host immunity (28Brooks D.G. Trifilo M.J. Edelmann K.H. Teyton L. McGavern D.B. Oldstone M.B.

Interestingly, another gammaherpesvirus, EBV, and a betaherpesvirus, CMV, encode viral homologs of IL-10, which contribute to evasion from virus-specific immune responses and to the establishment of latent infections (29Jochum S. Moosmann A. Lang S. Hammerschmidt W. Zeidler R.

In KSHV-associated diseases, such as PEL and MCD in patients with HIV/AIDS, elevated levels of viral cytokine IL-6 and of cellular cytokines IL-6, IL-10, stromal cell-derived factor 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor are thought to contribute to viral persistence in and pathogenesis of these virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (31Jones K.D.

IL-10 is produced by a number of cells of the immune system, such as T-, B-, and dendritic cells and macrophages, and the IL-10 promoter is regulated by various transcriptional networks in different cell types (35Saraiva M. O'Garra A. The regulation of IL-10 production by immune cells.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10 (20154735): 170-18110.1038/nri2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar). Recent interesting studies have demonstrated that infection by KSHV or expression of the viral miRNAs miR-K12-3 and miR-K12-7 induces IL-10 in macrophages through targeting the negative regulator of IL-10 transcription, C/EBPÎ² (36Qin Z. Kearney P. Plaisance K. Parsons C.H. Pivotal advance: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)-encoded microRNA specifically induce IL-6 and IL-10 secretion by macrophages and monocytes.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2010; 87 (20052801): 25-3410.1189/jlb.0409251Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). STAT3 activation contributes to IL-10 production by dendritic cells exposed to UV-inactivated KSHV (37Santarelli R. Gonnella R. Di Giovenale G. Cuomo L. Capobianchi A. Granato M. Gentile G. Faggioni A. Cirone M. STAT3 activation by KSHV correlates with IL-10, IL-6 and IL-23 release and an autophagic block in dendritic cells.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (24577500)4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These observations support the idea that lytic replication caused by intermittent minor reactivation during latency may be associated with IL-10 production by KSHV-infected cells. In this study, we examined the effect of K-RTA on IL-10 up-regulation and explored the possible mechanism of K-RTA-mediated IL-10 promoter activation. We show, for the first time, that K-RTA significantly activates the human IL-10 promoter through association with SP1 and SP3 in KSHV-infected and non-infected human cells. We also show that specific residues such as Lys-152, Lys-154, and His-145 on K-RTA play a role in K-RTAâmediated IL-10 promoter activation. These data indicate that the functional activity of K-RTA can contribute to IL-10 induction in KSHV-associated diseases. KSHV-infected PEL cells produce various cytokines, including IL-10 (38Asou H. Said J.W. Yang R. Munker R. Park D.J. Kamada N. Koeffler H.P.

Viral and cellular cytokines in AIDS-related malignant lymphomatous effusions.Blood. 2000; 96 (10942415): 1599-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and some PEL cells induce lytic viral replication under latent conditions (34Gasperini P. Sakakibara S. Tosato G. Contribution of viral and cellular cytokines to Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus pathogenesis.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2008; 84 (18319288): 994-100010.1189/jlb.1107777Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The KSHV-infected PEL cell line JSC-1 is reported to show higher basal and induced expression of lytic phase genes and to produce higher titers of infectious viruses than KSHV-infected BC3 cells (40Cannon J.S. Ciufo D. Hawkins A.L. Griffin C.A. Borowitz M.J. Hayward G.S. Ambinder R.F. A new primary effusion lymphoma-derived cell line yields a highly infectious Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus-containing supernatant.J. Virol. 2000; 74 (11024147): 10187-1019310.1128/JVI.74.21.10187-10193.2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In line with those results, luciferase reporter assays confirmed that promoter activities for the lytic phase initiator ORF50/K-RTA and human IL-10 genes were higher in the KSHV-infected PEL cell line JSC-1 than in BC3 cells (Fig. 1A). Quantitative real-time PCR showed that the relative expression of IL-10 mRNA was higher in JSC-1 cells than in BC3 cells and that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a chemical initiator of lytic viral replication (41Renne R. Zhong W. Herndier B. McGrath M. Abbey N. Kedes D. Ganem D. Lytic growth of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8) in culture.Nat.

These results suggest that lytic replication and IL-10 mRNA expression are correlated. Various transcription factors are involved in IL-10 mRNA induction in different cell types and conditions. We examined the influence of KSHV lytic replication on IL-10 gene promoter activity, by luciferase reporter assays, using reporter plasmids (p-265) containing IL-10 promoter regions corresponding to the 5â²-upstream sequence of the human IL-10 gene open reading frame (position â265 to â1 from the first ATG codon). The activity of the IL-10 promoter was increased after TPA treatment (a stimulus for lytic viral replication) in KSHV-infected JSC-1 cells (Fig. 1C). Expression of FLAGâK-RTA activated IL-10 promoter activity from reporter plasmids in JSC-1, BC3, and HCT 116 cells (Fig. 1D). The N-terminal portion of K-RTA (amino acids (aa) 1â490), lacking its C-terminal transactivation domain, can bind directly to the K-RTA-responsive element (43Chang P.J. Miller G. Autoregulation of DNA binding and protein stability of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ORF50 protein.J. Virol. 2004; 78 (15367633): 10657-1067310.1128/JVI.78.19.10657-10673.2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Transactivation domain is also responsible for binding to other transcriptional co-factors (8Staudt M.R. Dittmer D.P. The Rta/Orf50 transactivator proteins of the gamma-herpesviridae.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2007; 312 (17089794): 71-100PubMed Google Scholar, 11West J.T. Wood C. The role of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus-8 regulator of transcription activation (RTA) in control of gene expression.Oncogene. 2003; 22 (12910252): 5150-516310.1038/sj.onc.1206555Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). FLAGâK-RTA (F490, containing aa 1â490) did not activate p-265 in KSHV-infected JSC-1 or non-infected HCT 116 cells (Fig. 1E). In addition, transcription of IL-10 mRNA was induced by full-length K-RTA but not by F490 in HCT 116 cells (Fig. 1F). Thus, the transactivation domain of K-RTA is required for K-RTAâmediated IL-10 mRNA induction. To examine direct binding of K-RTA to the IL-10 promoter DNA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed. The results showed that direct binding of FLAGâK-RTA (1â531) with IL-10 promoter sequences (â265/â1) was not detected, although FLAGâK-RTA (1â531) bound to PAN promoter DNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, G and H). These data suggested that K-RTA has the potential to transactivate the IL-10 promoter by co-operating with other factors. The basic region at the N terminus of K-RTA is proposed to have a critical role in the direct binding to DNA (16Guito J. Lukac D.M. KSHV Rta promoter specification and viral reactivation.Front. Microbiol. 2012; 3 (22347875): 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We introduced single lysine-to-arginine substitutions in the basic region of K-RTA (K94R, K124R, K142R, K152R, and K154R), and we found that Lys-152 and Lys-154 are responsible for the transactivation of IL-10 and PAN promoters (Fig. S1). Next we compared the activities of the mutant K-RTAs K152R and K154R with that of an already published mutant, H145L (44Yu Y. Wang S.E. Hayward G.S. The KSHV immediate-early transcription factor RTA encodes ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that targets IRF7 for proteosome-mediated degradation.Immunity. 2005; 22 (15664159): 59-7010.1016/j.immuni.2004.11.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). H145L K-RTA is shown to lose the capacity to promote degradation of IRF7 as well as self-ubiquitination (44Yu Y. Wang S.E. Hayward G.S. The KSHV immediate-early transcription factor RTA encodes ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that targets IRF7 for proteosome-mediated degradation.Immunity. 2005; 22 (15664159): 59-7010.1016/j.immuni.2004.11.011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These mutant K-RTAs were expressed at comparable levels in cells (Fig. 2A), and luciferase reporter assays showed that the K152R, K154R, and H145L mutations caused a loss of transactivational activity of K-RTA in both PAN and IL-10 p-265 promoters (Fig. 2, B and C). Consistently, our in vitro EMSA experiments indicated that these three mutant K-RTAs lost direct DNA-binding ability to the PAN promoter DNA (Fig. S2). To compare the loading of mutant K-RTA on IL-10 promoter DNA, extracts of cells expressing wild type or mutant K-RTAs were subjected to DNA affinity precipitation, by an avidinâbiotin-coupled DNA (ABCD) assay. We found that affinity precipitation of mutant K-RTAs with p-265 DNA was clearly reduced (Fig. 2D). In addition, loading of K152R and K154R mutants on IL-10 promoter p-265 reporter plasmid was analyzed by ChIP assay. The results showed that the targeting of the K152R and K154R mutant K-RTAs to p-265 plasmid was clearly diminished (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, we compared the affinity of mutant K-RTAs for chromatin by a biochemical cell fractionation method (Fig. S3). In contrast to the case of wild-type K-RTA, significant amounts of mutant K-RTAs (K152R, K154R, and H145L) were readily extracted by low-salt buffer, and there was little mutant K-RTA in nuclear extracts (Fig. S3, B and C). Because microscopic analysis showed nuclear localization of both K152R and K154R mutant K-RTAs (Fig. 2F), the DNA-binding ability of the basic domain plays a pivotal role in chromatin retention and IL-10 promoter targeting of K-RTA, despite the fact that, in vitro, direct binding of K-RTA to the IL-10 promoter DNA was not detected (Fig. 1G). Collectively, these data suggested that K-RTA might require other co-factors for IL-10 promoter activation. Transcription of the IL-10 gene is regulated in a context- and cell type-specific manner. Although the IL-10 promoter region present in the p-265 plasmid does not contain the canonical RBP-JÎº-binding element 5â²-GTGGGAA-3â², the K-RTA-binding CANT repeat-like sequence (45Palmeri D. Carroll K.D. Gonzalez-Lopez O. Lukac D.M. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Rta tetramers make high-affinity interactions with repetitive DNA elements in the Mta promoter to stimulate DNA binding of RBP-Jk/CSL.J. Virol. 2011; 85 (21880753): 11901-1191510.1128/JVI.05479-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) is present (sequence from â236 to â229, 5â²-CAATCATT-3â²). Additionally, various transcription factors, including the AP-1 complex, NFY, c-musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma factor (c-MAF), interferon regulatory factors (IRF), SP1, SP3, STAT3, nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB), PBX1, and C/EBP, have been reported to bind to this region (46Iyer S.S. Cheng G. Role of interleukin 10 transcriptional regulation in inflammation and autoimmune disease.Crit. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 32 (22428854): 23-6310.1615/CritRevImmunol.v32.i1.30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed mutant IL-10 promoter reporter p-265 plasmids harboring mutations on these transcriptional factor-targeting elements to test their contribution to K-RTA-mediated IL-10 promoter transactivation (Fig. 3A). The results of luciferase reporter assays showed that mutations involving SP1-, SP3-, PBX1-, or NF-ÎºB-targeting elements clearly reduced K-RTAâmediated p-265 reporter activation (mSP, mPBX, and mNF-ÎºB in Fig. 3, A and B). SP1 has been shown to interact with various cellular proteins (47Beishline K. Azizkhan-Clifford J. Sp1 and the 'hallmarks of cancer'.FEBS J. 2015; 282 (25393971): 224-25810.1111/febs.13148Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). PBX1 also forms a complex with SP1 and activates expression of a subset of promoters containing SP1-binding sites (48Bjerke G.A. Hyman-Walsh C. Wotton D. Cooperative transcriptional activation by Klf4, Meis2, and Pbx1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31 (21746878): 3723-373310.1128/MCB.01456-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of the SP1/3-targeting site on K-RTAâmediated transactivation of the IL-10 promoter. The loading of K-RTA on IL-10 promoter DNA was analyzed by ABCD assay using biotin-labeled wild type or mSP IL-10 promoter DNA (fragment from â265 to â1). The results showed that co-precipitation of K-RTA was significantly decreased by mutation at the SP1/3-targeting element (from AGGAGG to GAATCC, positions â177 to â172 in mSP) (Fig. 3C). ChIP assay confirmed that the occupancy of IL-10 promoter p-265 by K-RTA was reduced by a mutation at the SP1/3-targeting element (mSP), suggesting that the SP1/3-binding site is involved in the loading of K-RTA onto the IL-10 promoter (Fig. 3D). In addition, luciferase reporter assays showed that co-expression of SP1-HA or SP3-HA with K-RTA elevated K-RTAâmediated IL-10 pr"

We tested the reliability of 13C signatures (Î´13C) in cattle tail switch hair to retrospectively trace back the annual dietary proportion of maize of different production systems without having to sample and analyze the feed. Furthermore, we investigated if differences in dietary proportion of maize during summer and winter feeding can be detected in a single tail switch hair by sampling hair only once a year. We sampled hair and obtained information on management and annual composition of diets on 23 cattle farms in northern Germany. Farms differed in dietary proportions of maize, grass and concentrates as well as in grazing regime (year-round grazing, summer grazing, no grazing). We found that the annual mean Î´13C values (Î´13CY) of two hair sections that contain the isotopic information of summer and winter feeding is a robust indicator for the annual proportion of maize in cattle diet on a farm. The grazing regimes could clearly be distinguished by analyzing seasonal mean Î´13C values (Î´13CS). We could also demonstrate short term changes in the diet changes by means of Î´13CS. We conclude that the method can be used in different cattle production systems to check on dietary proportions of maize for a period of one year before sampling of hair."
https://openalex.org/W2769257823,"Horizontal behavior of highly migratory marine species is difficult to decipher because animals are wide-ranging, spend minimal time at the ocean surface, and utilize remote habitats. Satellite telemetry enables researchers to track individual movements, but population level inferences are rare due to data limitations that result from difficulty of capture and sporadic tag reporting. We introduce a Bayesian modeling framework to address population level questions with satellite telemetry data when data are sparse. We also outline an approach for identifying informative variables for use within the model. We tested our modeling approach using a large telemetry dataset for Shortfin Makos (Isurus oxyrinchus), which allowed us to assess the effects of various degrees of data paucity. First, a permuted Random Forest analysis is implemented to determine which variables are most informative. Next, a generalized additive mixed model is used to help define the relationship of each remaining variable with the response variable. Using jags and rjags for the analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, we then developed a movement model to generate parameter estimates for each of the variables of interest. By randomly reducing the tagging dataset by 25, 50, 75, and 90 percent and recalculating the parameter estimates, we demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian approach can be applied in data-limited situations. We also demonstrate how two commonly used linear mixed models with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) can be similarly applied. Additionally, we simulate data from known parameter values to test each modelâs ability to recapture those values. Despite performing similarly, we advocate using the Bayesian over the MLE approach due to the ability for later studies to easily utilize results of past study to inform working models, and the ability to use prior knowledge via informed priors in systems where such information is available."
https://openalex.org/W2769975792,"The objective of this study was to identify the key changed subtype of T helper cells (Th cells) and their cytokines in pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in rats. The severity of arthritis was evaluated by body weight, clinical score, the perimeter of ankle and mid-paw and histological assessment of ankle joints. Cytokines of Th1, Th2 and Th17 were determined in the spleen and inguinal lymph nodes at 28 days after pristane injection by real-time qPCR. The mRNA levels of IL-22 receptors, IL-22R1 and IL-22BP, in the spleen were quantified by real-time qPCR. Additionally, IL-22 expression in synovial membrane was detected by Western blotting, and serum IL-22 concentration was determined by ELISA. Correlation between IL-22 concentration and clinical score was analyzed. By screening the cytokines of Th1, Th2 and Th17 expression profile, we found that the mRNA levels of Th17 cytokines were significantly increased in PIA rats. Particularly, a significant increase in the protein expression of IL-22 was determined in synovial membrane and serum from PIA rats, and correlated with clinical score. We conclude that IL-22 expression level was increased and correlated with disease severity, which indicated that IL-22 may play an important role in development of PIA, and was helpful to explorer the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis."
