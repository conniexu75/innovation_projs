https://openalex.org/W2025460547,The similarity in genesis and the more pertinent physical characteristics of fission-produced Cs(137) and Sr(90) suggests the use of the first as a convenient monitor for the other prior to uptake in the biosphere. Results are presented which indicate the feasibility of this approach in the case of soils.

However, in X2 generation, the mutation rate for combined treatment is lower than for x-rays alone in lower dosages and higher than for x-rays alone in higher dosages."

https://openalex.org/W4253864814,A method is described for producing high vacua. A magnetically suspended molecular pumping rotor is operated inside a sealed glass vacuum system. The system is free of lubricants and can be baked out. The system gives promise of producing pressures below those previously used.

https://openalex.org/W4237171432,"The item on Clarence J. Hylander [Science 130, 1244 (1959)] indicated that he left the post of executive director of the American Institute of Biological Sciences to take his current position as visiting professor of biology at Bowdoin College. He last held the AIBS post in 1953; since that time he has been an information officer for the Army Chemical Corps and has written a number of books."
