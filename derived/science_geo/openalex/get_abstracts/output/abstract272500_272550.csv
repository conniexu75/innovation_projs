https://openalex.org/W2088157474,"A procedure for generating colloidal suspensions of Si that exhibit luminescence, attributed to quantum confinement effects, is described. Samples of n- or p-type Si that have been electrochemically etched to form porous Si can be ultrasonically dispersed into methylene chloride, acetonitrile, methanol, toluene, or water solvents, forming a suspension of fine Si particles that luminesce. Transmission electron microscopy analyses show that the Si particles have irregular shapes, with diameters ranging from many micrometers to nanometers. Luminescent, composite polystyrene/Si films can be made by the addition of polystyrene to a toluene suspension of the Si nanoparticles and casting of the resulting solution onto a glass slide."
https://openalex.org/W2053774245,"Results of studies on the interaction between the tip of an atomic force microscope and polystyrene molecules in a film spread on a surface are reported. The tip produces a persistent deformation on the film; some of the polymer molecules are eventually pulled up by the tip. Nanometer-size structures are induced, resulting in a pattern that is periodic and is oriented perpendicular to the scan direction."
https://openalex.org/W2052632605,"Recent experimental results are beginning to limit seriously the theories that can be considered to explain high-temperature superconductivity. The unmistakable observations of a Fermi surface, by several groups and methods, make it the focus of realistic theories of the metallic phases. Data from angle-resolved photoemission, positron annihilaton, and de Haas-van Alphen experiments are in agreement with band theory predictions, implying that the metallic phases cannot be pictured as doped insulators. The character of the low energy excitations (""quasiparticles""), which interact strongly with atomic motions, with magnetic fluctuations, and possibly with charge fluctuations, must be sorted out before the superconducting pairing mechanism can be given a microscopic basis."
https://openalex.org/W2089427819,"The strontium isotopic composition of biogenic precipitates that occur in estuarine sediments can be used as proxy indicator of paleosalinity and for assessing precipitation and river discharge rates over thousands of years. In the San Francisco Bay estuary, river water with low 87Sr/86Sr ratio (average, 0.7065) and low Sr concentration (0.13 parts per million) mixes with seawater with a higher 87Sr/86Sr ratio (0.7092) and Sr concentration (7.9 parts per million). The predicted mixing relation between salinity and Sr isotopic composition is confirmed by measurements of modern estuarine surface waters. A paleosalinity record obtained from foraminifera for the ancestral San Francisco Bay during oxygen isotope substage 5e of the last interglacial reflects a global rise and fall of sea level, and short time-scale variations related to fluctuations in discharge rates of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers."
https://openalex.org/W2048268977,"Regional variations in the Nd, Sr, and Pb isotopic compositions of Neogene basalts from the western United States are commonly interpreted to originate in the subcontinental mantle. In southern California, isotopic variability is restricted to lavas that lack mantle-derived xenoliths; xenolith-bearing basalts have uniform isotopic compositions similar to those of ocean-island basalts (OIBs). Combined with available geochemical data, these observations suggest that isotopic variability at these volcanoes results from subtle crustal contamination, locally by mafic crust, of primitive OIB-like magma. Recognition of such cryptic contamination may help to reconcile local discrepancies between tectonic and isotopic views of the subcontinental mantle."

https://openalex.org/W2079080686,Structural phase transformations in Ni(7)S(6) and Cu(7)S(4) have been observed dynamically by in situ experiments in a transmission electron microscope. In this way it is possible to demonstrate the possibility of two fundamentally different types of behavior: (i) the ideal transformation from the stable high-temperature form to the stable low-temperature form and vice versa and (ii) alternative metastable processes which operate when the formation of the low-temperature state is impeded.
