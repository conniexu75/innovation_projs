https://openalex.org/W1996711495,"To identify genes necessary for the photoproduction of H2 in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, random insertional mutants were screened for clones unable to produce H2. One of the identified mutants, denoted hydEF-1, is incapable of assembling an active [Fe] hydrogenase. Although the hydEF-1 mutant transcribes both hydrogenase genes and accumulates full-length hydrogenase protein, H2 production activity is not observed. The HydEF protein contains two unique domains that are homologous to two distinct prokaryotic proteins, HydE and HydF, which are found exclusively in organisms containing [Fe] hydrogenase. In the C. reinhardtii genome, the HydEF gene is adjacent to another hydrogenase-related gene, HydG. All organisms with [Fe] hydrogenase and sequenced genomes contain homologues of HydE, HydF, and HydG, which, prior to this study, were of unknown function. Within several prokaryotic genomes HydE, HydF, and HydG are found in putative operons with [Fe] hydrogenase structural genes. Both HydE and HydG belong to the emerging radical S-adenosylmethionine (commonly designated “Radical SAM”) superfamily of proteins. We demonstrate here that HydEF and HydG function in the assembly of [Fe] hydrogenase. Northern blot analysis indicates that mRNA transcripts for both the HydEF gene and the HydG gene are anaerobically induced concomitantly with the two C. reinhardtii [Fe] hydrogenase genes, HydA1 and HydA2. Complementation of the bx;1C. reinhardtii hydEF-1 mutant with genomic DNA corresponding to a functional copy of the HydEF gene restores hydrogenase activity. Moreover, co-expression of the C. reinhardtii HydEF, HydG, and HydA1 genes in Escherichia coli results in the formation of an active HydA1 enzyme.

It functions as a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53 and is indispensable for the ability of oxidative stress-activated p53 to induce apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms underlying the apoptogenic effect of p66Shc are unknown. Here we report the following three findings. (i) The apoptosome can be properly activated in vitro in the absence of p66Shc only if purified cytochrome c is supplied. (ii) Cytochrome c release after oxidative signals is impaired in the absence of p66Shc. (iii) p66Shc induces the collapse of the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential after oxidative stress. Furthermore, we showed that a fraction of cytosolic p66Shc localizes within mitochondria where it forms a complex with mitochondrial Hsp70. Treatment of cells with ultraviolet radiation induced the dissociation of this complex and the release of monomeric p66Shc. We propose that p66Shc regulates the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial damage after dissociation from an inhibitory protein complex. Genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that mitochondria regulate life span through their effects on the energetic metabolism (mitochondrial theory of aging). Our data suggest that mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis might also contribute to life span determination.

P66Shc is a splice variant of p52Shc/p46Shc, a cytoplasmic signal transducer involved in the transmission of mitogenic signals from tyrosine kinases to Ras (1Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F.

It has the typical domain organization of all members of the Shc family of adaptor proteins (a phosphotyrosine binding domain, a collagen homology 1 (CH1) 1The abbreviations used are: CH1 or CH2, collagen homology region 1 or 2; cyt c, cytochrome c; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Hsp, heat shock protein; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblasts; mt, mitochondrial; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; PT, permeability transition; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SH2, Src homology 2; WB, Western blotting; WT, wild-type. region, and an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain) and is characterized by a unique amino-terminal region named CH2. P66Shc, however, is not involved in Ras regulation but functions instead in the intracellular pathways that convert oxidative signals into apoptosis (2Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A.E. Pelicci G.

Homozygous deletion of p66Shc in mice (p66Shc-/-) delays senescence and prolongs life span by about one-third, suggesting that p66Shc is a genetic determinant of aging in mammals (3Migliaccio E.

In aging animal models of both invertebrates and vertebrates, a strong correlation exists between longevity and increased resistance to oxidative stress (4Guarente L. Kenyon C. Nature. 2000; 408: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). P66Shc regulates intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (5Trinei M. Giorgio M. Cicalese A. Barozzi S.

Indeed, primary cells isolated from p66Shc-/- mice (hematopoietic precursors, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells) are resistant to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of p66Shc induces apoptosis in the same cellular contexts (5Trinei M.

Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). P66Shc is a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53. Activated p53 induces p66Shc protein up-regulation by increasing its stability, and overexpression of p53 is unable to induce apoptosis in p66Shc-/- fibroblasts, suggesting that p66Shc regulates p53-dependent apoptosis (5Trinei M. Giorgio M. Cicalese A. Barozzi S. Ventura A. Migliaccio E. Milia E. Padura I.M. Raker V.A. Maccarana M. Petronilli V. Minucci S. Bernardi P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3872-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence, however, indicates that the p53-p66Shc signaling pathway is specifically involved in the propagation of proapoptotic oxidative signals, whereas other functions of p53 are not influenced by p66Shc expression (5Trinei M. Giorgio M. Cicalese A. Barozzi S. Ventura A. Migliaccio E. Milia E. Padura I.M. Raker V.A. Maccarana M. Petronilli V. Minucci S. Bernardi P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3872-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms through which p66Shc mediates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis are, however, largely unknown. Indirect evidence suggests that p66Shc induces apoptosis by modulating ROS-induced mitochondrial damage and release of apoptogenic factors. Activated p53 induces a sustained rise in ROS levels that is possibly implicated in the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) pore, the release of apoptogenic factors including cytochrome c (cyt c), and the cytosolic assembly of the apoptosome (5Trinei M. Giorgio M. Cicalese A. Barozzi S. Ventura A. Migliaccio E. Milia E. Padura I.M. Raker V.A. Maccarana M. Petronilli V. Minucci S. Bernardi P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G.

Notably, cyclosporin A, a drug that binds to a component of the mitochondrial pore and inhibits PT and apoptosis, also inhibits p66Shc-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that p66Shc is involved in mitochondrial PT (5Trinei M.

The BG-8 mouse monoclonal and the anti-CH2 rabbit antibodies were generated following standard procedures (9Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The other antibodies are commercially available. The rabbit polyclonal anti-SH2 (anti-SHC) was from BD Transduction Laboratories, the rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase 3 came from Cell Signaling, the mouse monoclonal anti-mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (mtHsp70) was purchased from Alexis, the mouse monoclonal anti-CoxIV sub2 was from Molecular Probes, the mouse monoclonal anti-cyt c came from PharMingen, the rabbit polyclonal anti-Calnexin was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the rabbit polyclonal anti-PDI was a gift of Dr. R. Sitia. The JC-1 was purchased from Molecular Probe, and cyclosporin A was purchased from Sigma. Caspase-3 Activation Assays—Fluorescence-activated cell sorting-based determination of cleaved caspase-3 was carried out as follows. MEFs (106 cells for each sample) were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 1% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and labeled with 1:50 polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody. Samples were analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences, with Cell Quest software) using the anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody (Alexis). An in vitro assay of caspase-3 was performed as follows. MEFs (106 cells for each sample) were lysed in buffer A containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the protease inhibitor III mixture from Calbiochem (10Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar). The cellular extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min and then at 105 rpm for 1 h (S-100 fraction). 20 μg of the S-100 fraction was incubated in the absence or presence of 0.25 mg/ml of purified horse cyt c (Sigma) at 30 °C for 1 h in buffer A and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (WB). JC-1 Measurements of the Mitochondrial ΔΨ—Spectrofluorimetry was carried out as follows. MEFs were incubated with 0.1 μm JC-1 Red in complete culture medium (Molecular Probes) for 30 min and collected by trypsinization. 2 × 106 cells were re-suspended in 1 ml of phosphate buffer and transferred into the fluorometer cuvette. The intensity of fluorescence (red emission of the JC-1 dye) was registered at 590 nm upon excitation at the wavelength of 510 nm and monitored for up to 30 min. Cyclosporin A was added to the cells at 5 μm concentration 45 min before JC-1 staining. Confocal microscopy was carried out as follows. MEFs were seeded on slides, incubated with 0.1 μm JC-1 red (Molecular Probes) for 30 min, washed with phosphate buffer, and analyzed with the MRC 1024 Bio-Rad microscopy equipped with Laser Sharp 2000 software. H2O2 was added to a final concentration of 800 μm directly to the chamber of the microscope. Localization Experiments—Confocal fluorescence microscopy was performed as follows. MEFs were seeded on slides, incubated with Mito Tracker Red (Molecular Probes) in complete culture medium, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffer, incubated with the immuno-purified anti-p66Shc antibody or the anti-PDI antibody, and then with the appropriate anti-mouse secondary antibody Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences) or the anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Alexa 488 or Alexa 568 from Molecular Probes. Immunoelectron microscopy was carried out as follows. MEFs were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer, scraped, embedded in 12% gelatin with 2.3 m sucrose, mounted on aluminum pins, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryo-sections were obtained with a Reichert-Jung Ultra-cut E with a FC4E cryo-attachment and collected on copper-Formvar-carbon-coated grids. Immunogold localization on ultrathin cryo-sections was performed as described previously (11Schiaffino M.V. D'Addio M. Alloni A. Baschirotto C. Valetti C. Cortese K. Puri C. Bassi M.T. Colla C. Luca M. Tacchetti C. Ballabio A. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Sections were immunostained with a rabbit anti-p66 antibody followed by 15-nm protein A-gold and examined with a Zeiss EM 10 and FEI Tecnai 12-G2 electron microscopes. Subcellular fractionation was done as follows. Cells were collected with 10-ml/10-cm dish of cold MTC 0.25 m sucrose buffer (12Pon L.A. Schon E.A. Mitochondria: Methods in Cell Biology. 65. Academic Press, New York2001Google Scholar) using a cell scraper and then broken using a potter. Fresh livers were washed in phosphate buffer and homogenized using a potter in MTC 0.25 m sucrose buffer. Differential centrifugation rounds were then performed to separate nuclei (700 rpm), mitochondria (8000 rpm), the endoplasmic reticulum (15,000 rpm), and the soluble fraction. Submitochondrial fractions were prepared according to established procedures (13Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronilli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 185-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and monitored by polarographic analysis (14Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar). Chromatographic Methods—Lysates were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography using a fast protein liquid chromatography protein purification system on analytical Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The Superose column was eluted at 4 °C with JS buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 75, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Na4P2O7, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaF, and the protease inhibitor III mixture from Calbiochem) at 40 μl/min, and 50-μl fractions were collected. The column was calibrated with protein standards (Amersham Biosciences) including blue dextran (2000 kDa), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), β-amylase (200 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa). P66Shc Controls Cytochrome c Release from the Mitochondria and the Activation of Cytosolic Caspase-3—Apoptogenic oxidative signals lead to mitochondrial PT and to the release in the cytoplasm of a number of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins, including cyt c. Cytosolic cyt c forms a multimeric complex (the apoptosome) with the cytosolic apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 and caspase-9, which leads to cleavage of pro-caspase-3 and activation of the other downstream caspases (10Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar, 15Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar). To investigate whether activation of the apoptosome is regulated by p66Shc, we analyzed the extent of H2O2- or staurosporine-induced cleavage of caspase-3 in WT and p66Shc-/- primary MEFs. Staurosporine is an apoptogenic protein kinase c antagonist that, like H2O2, induces cyt c release and caspase-3 cleavage (16Li K. Li Y. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Spencer E. Chen Z.J. Wang X. Sanders W.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, H2O2 or staurosporine treatment was unable to activate caspase-3 in p66Shc-/- MEFs. Notably, re-expression of p66Shc into p66Shc-/- MEFs restored a normal caspase-3 activation response (Fig. 1A). To investigate which components of the apoptosome or activation steps are defective in p66Shc-/- cells, we analyzed the apoptosome assembly and its functional integrity in vitro. Cytosolic fractions (105 rpm supernatants) from staurosporine- or H2O2-treated cells were analyzed for their ability to activate pro-caspase-3 as determined by WB using specific antibodies against the cleaved caspase-3 fragment. The presence of cytosolic cyt c is the only limiting step for the apoptosome activation in this assay, because the addition of purified cyt c also induces caspase-3 cleavage in lysates from untreated cells (16Li K. Li Y. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Spencer E. Chen Z.J. Wang X. Sanders W.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we detected no caspase-3 activation in the lysates of staurosporine-treated p66Shc-/- cells as compared with wild-type MEFs or p66Shc-/- MEFs re-expressing p66Shc (Fig. 1B). Notably, the addition of purified cyt c to lysates from staurosporine-treated p66Shc-/- MEFs restored caspase-3 activation (Fig. 1B). Comparable results were obtained using H2O2 or UVC-treated p66Shc-/- MEFs (not shown). These results demonstrate that the apoptosome can be properly activated in vitro in the absence of p66Shc only if cyt c is supplied, suggesting that optimal concentration of cytosolic cyt c is the limiting factor for the activation of the apoptosome in p66Shc-/- cells. Consistently, the concentration of cytosolic cyt c in staurosporine- (Fig. 1C), H2O2- (Fig. 1C), or UVC-treated (not shown) p66Shc-/- MEFs is severely reduced as compared with that of matched control cells (Fig. 1C). P66Shc Is Required for the Collapse of Mitochondrial Transmembrane Potential Induced by Oxidative Stress—A critical event during the mitochondrial PT and the subsequent release of cyt c is the loss of the mitochondrial trans-membrane potential (mtΔΨ) (17Marchetti P. Castedo M. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Hirsh T. Macho A. Harffner A. Hirsh F. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 184: 1155-1160Crossref Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 18Wang X. Gen. Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of p66Shc on the mtΔΨ, we analyzed the fluorescence emission of WT and p66Shc-/- fibroblasts stained with the specific, potential-sensitive dye JC-1 (19Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Because of its positive charge, intracellular JC-1 accumulates within energized mitochondria (high mtΔΨ), where it aggregates because of high local concentrations. During apoptosis, mitochondria become de-energized (low mtΔΨ), and JC-1 is released into the cytoplasm as a monomer (19Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The monomeric or aggregated forms of JC-1 can be distinguished by the differences of the emitted light (red at 590 nm or green at 527 nm, respectively) in cells excited with a 510-nm radiation (19Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). WT and p66Shc-/- MEFs were stained with JC-1 and treated with H2O2. JC-1 fluorescence was then analyzed in the entire cell population by spectrofluorometry (Fig. 2A) or, at the level of single cells, by confocal fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2B). Prior to H2O2 treatment, the JC-1 red emission signals of WT and p66Shc-/- cells were comparable, suggesting that the levels of steady-state mtΔΨ are not influenced significantly by p66Shc (Fig. 2A, initial traces). As reported, H2O2 treatment of WT cells induced a marked dissipation of the mtΔΨ (see the progressive decrease of fluorescence intensity in Fig. 2A, black line) and the gradual disappearance of red signals (in Fig. 2B, panels b–e). In the p66Shc-/- cells the extent of H2O2-induced depolarization was, in contrast, reduced significantly (Fig. 2A, red line, and 2B, panels g–l). In particular, the slope of the fluorescence intensity trace measured in the 5–10 min interval after H2O2 treatment was reduced by ∼50% in the p66Shc-/- cells (see inset of Fig. 2A). Pre-incubation of WT or p66Shc-/- cells with 5 μm cyclosporin A completely prevented H2O2-induced mtΔΨ dissipation, indicating that the target of oxidative damage is either at or upstream of the PT (Fig. 2A, gray line). It appears, therefore, that p66Shc expression regulates H2O2- induced mtΔΨ dissipation. P66Shc Localizes in Different Intracellular Compartments Including Endoplasmic Reticulum and Mitochondria—Other pro-apoptotic proteins that induce dissipation of the mtΔΨ and cyt c release, such as the Bcl-2 like family members Bax, Bad, and Bid, exert their effects directly by associating with the mitochondria (18Wang X.

Therefore, we investigated the intracellular localization of p66Shc under basal conditions and after oxidative stress by indirect confocal immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 3) and cell fractionation (Fig. 4) experiments.Fig. 4Intracellular localization of p66Shc by cellular fractionation.

C, P66Shc is partially protected from proteinase K. Mitochondria- and endoplasmic reticulum-enriched fractions were treated with proteinase K (PK) and analyzed by WB with anti-calnexin or anti-p66Shc antibodies, as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Confocal immunofluorescence analysis was performed using WT and p66Shc-/- MEFs or p66Shc-/- MEFs re-expressing p66Shc. We generated anti-p66Shc monoclonal antibodies by immunizing p66Shc-/- mice with the p66Shc CH2 region (GST-CH2) expressed in bacteria. The BG8 hybridoma supernatant was selected based on its ability to stain WT but not p66Shc-/- fibroblasts (immunofluorescence analysis; Fig. 3A) and to specifically recognize p66Shc polypeptides (Western blotting; Fig. 3B). The BG8 staining pattern of WT or p66Shc-/- cells re-expressing p66Shc was cytosolic with a typically punctuated appearance that was most prominent in the perinuclear region (Fig. 3A). To investigate whether a fraction of the cytosolic p66Shc localizes in mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum, cells were stained with the Mito Tracker Red dye (a fixable mitochondrial selective probe) or the anti-PDI antibody that recognized the PDI endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-specific protein and with the BG8 antibody. An overlay of Mito Tracker and anti-BG8 staining from untreated WT fibroblasts revealed a partial co-localization (Fig. 3C, upper panels). The extent of Mito Tracker/anti-BG8 co-staining increased slightly after treatment with UVC or H2O2 (not shown). Image statistical analysis revealed that the percentage of the anti-BG8/Mito Tracker co-stained areas in the untreated fibroblasts was 5.8 ± 0.7%, whereas after UVC the percentage increased up to 11.6 ± 1.6% (p < 0.01). Similar results were obtained using p66Shc-/- MEFs re-expressing p66Shc (Fig. 3C, central panels) or green fluorescent protein-p66Shc (not shown). An overlay of anti-PDI (Fig. 3C, green) and anti-BG8 staining (Fig. 3C, red) from p66Shc-/- MEFs re-expressing p66Shc and WT fibroblasts (not shown) revealed a partial co-localization of p66Shc with the PDI ER-specific protein. (Fig. 3C, lower panels), indicating that p66Shc localized even in the ER. Similar results were obtained by immunoelectron microscopy using a different anti-p66Shc antibody (a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against the CH2 region of p66Shc). This antibody stained WT and p66Shc-/- MEFs re-expressing p66Shc but not the p66Shc-/- cells (Fig. 3D). Quantitative analysis of electron microscopy images revealed that ∼44% of the total score of p66Shc signals lies within the mitochondria and 24% in the ER (Table 1).Table IMorphometry on p66Shc immunogold immunoelectron microscopy localization Shown are the number of gold particles associated with mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and other organelles.

Schon E.A. Mitochondria: Methods in Cell Biology. 65. Academic Press, New York2001Google Scholar). The enrichment for mitochondria in the various fractions was monitored by measuring oxygen consumption (using a Clark-type electrode; polarographic analysis) or by Western blotting using antibodies against different mitochondrial proteins, including cyt c, the subunit 2 of the cyt c oxidase (COX IV), and mtHsp70. The ER fraction was monitored using antibodies against ER-specific proteins, calnexin, and PDI. Representative experiments using subcellular fractions from WT MEFs or mouse liver homogenates are shown in Fig. 4, A and B, respectively. Consistently, we detected p66Shc in the soluble, mitochondrial, and ER fractions, although with different reciprocal distributions when comparing different samples. Notably, in the liver fractions the presence of p66Shc correlated significantly with the highest respiratory activity (Fig. 4B). To preliminarily map p66Shc expression within mitochondria, purified liver mitochondria were further fractionated to separate the outer (Fig. 4B, mLM) and inner (Fig. 4B, mHM) membranes and the soluble content (Fig. 4B, mS). P66Shc was retained with the sub-mitochondrial fraction enriched for the inner membrane, which retains the highest respiratory activity (Fig. 4B). To confirm that p66Shc localizes within mitochondria, the mitochondrial and the ER-containing fractions were treated with proteinase K, which can digest only those proteins that are not protected by closed phospholipidic bilayers (20Gonzalez-Baro M.R. Granger D.A. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43182-43188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As expected, proteinase K degraded calnexin in the ER fraction (Fig. 4C; the calnexin is a ER-associated protein whose presence in the mitochondrial fraction is due to contaminating ER, as shown in Fig. 4A). Notably, the p66Shc of the ER fraction, but not that of the mitochondrial fraction, was degraded by proteinase K (Fig. 4C), suggesting that some of the cytosolic p66Shc is associated with the ER membranes and confirming that mitochondrial p66Shc is mainly localized within these organelles. UVC Treatment Induces the Release of Mitochondrial p66Shc from High Molecular Mass Complexes—The localization experiments described above indicate that a fraction of p66Shc localizes within mitochondria under basal conditions and that apoptogenic oxidative signals (H2O2 or UV) induce only a modest (∼50%) accumulation of mitochondrial p66Shc. To investigate whether oxidative stress induces modifications of mitochondrial p66Shc, we investigated the extent of p66Shc association within multimolecular complexes by size exclusion chromatography before and after stress treatment. Mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 5A, upper right panel) from WT MEFs, prior and after UVC treatment, were analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superose-6 size exclusion chromatographic column, and the eluted fractions (fractions 10–22; see chromatogram in Fig. 5A) were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against p66Shc and mtHsp70. In the mitochondrial fractions from untreated MEFs, p66Shc eluted within the high molecular mass gel filtration fractions with a peak in the fractions that had an apparent molecular mass of 670 kDa (Fig. 5A, lower panel). Strikingly, 10 min of UVC treatment of WT MEFs provoked the complete disappearance of p66Shc from the high molecular mass size exclusion chromatography fractions and its appearance within the low molecular mass fractions with a peak of ∼66 kDa (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that mitochondrial p66Shc exists within high molecular mass complexes under basal conditions and that it becomes monomeric after oxidative stress treatment. Mitochondrial p66Shc Forms a Stable Complex with mtHsp70 That Is Released after UVC Treatment—Western blotting analysis of the same mitochondrial size exclusion chromatography fractions revealed a behavior of mtHsp70 similar to that of p66Shc. In untreated cells, mtHsp70 eluted in the same high molecular mass fractions of p66Shc (peak around 669 kDa), whereas after UVC treatment, it was detected within lower molecular mass fractions with a peak of ∼150–200 kDa (Fig 5A, second and fourth row of the lower panel). To investigate whether p66Shc and mtHsp70 form a stable complex, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using mitochondrial fractions from untreated and UVC-treated WT MEFs. Mitochondria were purified from untreated or treated (by UVC for 10 min) WT MEFs. Western blotting analysis of total mitochondrial lysates showed a slight increase of p66Shc expression following UVC treatment, which is consistent with the immunofluorescence results, and a slight increase of mtHsp70 expression as well (Fig. 5B; left panels). Anti-Hsp70 Western blotting of anti-p66Shc immunoprecipitates from the same lysates revealed the existence of a stable p66Shc-Hsp70 complex in the untreated cells (Fig. 5B, right panels). The same, however, was not detected in mitochondrial lysates from UVC-treated MEFs (Fig. 5B, right panels). It appears, therefore, that mitochondrial p66Shc forms a stable complex with mtHsp70, which is released after UVC treatment. P66Shc mediates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain unknown. We reported here that a fraction of p66Shc localizes within mitochondria and is part of a high molecular mass complex that also contains mtHsp70. After the propagation of apoptogenic oxidative stress signals, the fraction of mitochondrial p66Shc increases slightly and dissociates from mtHsp70. Heat shock proteins are known negative regulators of apoptosis (21Bruey J.M. Ducasse C. Bonniaud P. Ravagnan L. Susin S.A. Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.P. Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). In particular, mtHsp70 (also known as Mortalin/Mot-2/GRP75/PBP74) is a member of the Hsp70 family of chaperons, which is involved in the regulation of cell senescence and immortalization. Among others, mtHsp70 associates with p53 (23Schwarzer C. Barnikol-Watanabe S. Thinnes F.P. Hilschmann N. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (24Mitsumoto A. Takeuchi A. Okawa K. Nakagawa Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), a putative component of the PT pore. Treatment with H2O2 induces up-regulation of mtHsp70, which is thought to protect mitochondria from oxidative stress (25Sadekova S. Lehnert S. Chow T.Y. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1997; 72: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Depletion of mtHsp70 sensitizes cells to ionizing radiations, whereas its over-expression inhibits apoptosis and delays the senescence of primary cells (22Wadhwa R. Yaguchi T. Hasan M.K. Mitsui Y. Reddel R.R. Kaul S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 274: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26Kaul S.C. Yaguchi T. Taira K. Reddel R.R. Wadhwa R. Exp.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that mtHsp70 acts in the mitochondria to prevent oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial damage. It is tempting to speculate that one of the targets of mtHsp70 is mitochondrial p66Shc, whose apoptogenic function might be inhibited when complexed to Hsp70. Notably, transgenic worms that constitutively overexpress the Hsp70 homolog show a life span extension, suggesting that Hsp70 is indeed a genetic determinant of life span in Caenorhabditis (27Yokoyama K. Fukumoto K. Murakami T. Harada S. Hosono R. Wadhwa R. Mitsui Y. Ohkuma S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The other known biochemical activity of p66Shc is the regulation of ROS metabolism. P66Shc-/- cells have reduced concentrations of steady-state ROS and reduced ROS up-regulation during p53-induced apoptosis, suggesting that p66Shc regulates ROS metabolism (5Trinei M. Giorgio M. Cicalese A. Barozzi S. Ventura A. Migliaccio E. Milia E. Padura I.M. Raker V.A. Maccarana M. Petronilli V. Minucci S. Bernardi P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3872-3878Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 8Nemoto S. Finkel T. Science. 2002; 295: 2450-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar).3 Because oxygen radicals are potent inducers of the mitochondrial PT due to their direct effect on the PT pore (28Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar), p66Shc might induce mitochondrial PT by increasing mitochondrial ROS levels. Accordingly, regulation of mitochondrial ROS levels would be the primary effect of mitochondrial p66Shc. Alternatively, ROS could be generated as the consequence of the mitochondrial damage provoked by p66Shc through ROS-independent mechanisms. In either cases, activation of mitochondrial p66Shc would result into the collapse of the mtΔΨ. How p66Shc enters in the mitochondria and injures mitochondrial integrity is, however, unknown. We have recently demonstrated that another Shc isoform, p46Shc, localizes almost exclusively to mitochondria (29Ventura A. Maccarana M. Raker V.A. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Through deletion-mapping experiments we showed that targeting of p46Shc to mitochondria is mediated by its first 32 amino acids, which behave as a bona fide mitochondrial targeting sequence. This mitochondrial signal peptide is also present in the p66Shc protein. However, differently than p46Shc, p66Shc is not actively imported into mitochondria in an in vitro import assay (29Ventura A. Maccarana M. Raker V.A. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the finding that the N-terminal location of this signal peptide is critical for its function and that the same sequence is more internally located in p66Shc (29Ventura A. Maccarana M. Raker V.A. Pelicci P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2299-2306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). P66Shc has been recently identified within mitochondrial associated membranes obtained from a mitochondrial-enriched fraction. 4R. Rizzuto, personal communication. The mitochondrial associated membrane fraction includes the ER membranes intimately connected to the mitochondria and is characterized by the presence of components of the ER mitochondrial network, namely the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ release channel (30Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). Therefore, p66Shc might enter the mitochondria through a mechanism involving ER mitochondria contacts. The mitochondrial theory of aging proposes that an accumulation of damage to mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA leads to aging. Indeed, age-related impairment in the respiratory enzymes not only decreases ATP synthesis but also enhances production of ROS, which is thought to be responsible for the increased rates of mitochondrial DNA mutations and mitochondrial oxidation damage that are observed in the aged tissues (6Sastre J. Pallardo F.V. Vina J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that p66Shc regulates apoptosis by acting at the level of mitochondria, possibly through the permeability transition pore, thereby suggesting that mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis might also contribute to life span determination. We are grateful to Paolo Bernardi, Rosario Rizzuto, and Saverio Minucci for discussions and critical reading of the manuscript and to Pietro Transidico for excellent technical assistance with the confocal microscope."
https://openalex.org/W2073690276,"A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 4 results in expression of either arginine (72R) or proline (72P) at codon 72 of p53. We demonstrate that the in vitro response of cells exposed to anticancer agents is strongly influenced by this SNP in wild-type p53. In inducible systems and in cells expressing the endogenous protein, expression of 72P wild-type p53 results in a predominant G1 arrest, with only a minor apoptosis, at drug concentrations causing extensive apoptosis in cells expressing the 72R wild-type variant. The superior apoptosis-inducing activity of the 72R form correlates with more efficient induction of specific apoptosis-associated genes, and is maximal in the presence of serine 46 (S46). In vivo, the outcome of chemo-radiotherapy of squamous carcinomas is more favourable in cancers retaining a wild-type 72R allele, such cases having higher response rates and longer survival than those with wild-type 72P. Together, these results reveal that this SNP is an important determinant of response to anticancer agents in cells expressing wild-type p53. Analysis of complete p53 genotype (mutation and SNP) merits detailed investigation as a simple means for prediction of treatment response and survival in clinical oncology."

Here we show that homozygous male mice with a targeted gene deletion of isoform 4 of the plasma membrane calcium/calmodulin-dependent calcium ATPase (PMCA), which is highly enriched in the sperm tail, are infertile due to severely impaired sperm motility. Furthermore, the PMCA inhibitor 5-(and-6)-carboxyeosin diacetate succinimidyl ester reduced sperm motility in wild-type animals, thus mimicking the effects of PMCA4 deficiency on sperm motility and supporting the hypothesis of a pivotal role of the PMCA4 on the regulation of sperm function and intracellular Ca2+ levels.

Successful fertilization requires the sperm to travel long distances and undergo capacitation prior to reaching the female egg. After reaching their target, the sperm must interact with the extracellular matrix of the egg, including proteins of the zona pellucida, and release acrosomal material. Calcium is considered to exert a function on most, if not all, of these processes. In this field, most of the work on Ca2+ signaling has focused on Ca2+ entry mechanisms, especially on the role of Ca2+ channels (1Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 2Publicover S.J. Barratt C.L. Hum. Reprod. (Oxf.). 1999; 14: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 3Wassarman P.M.

For example, gene ablation of the cation channel of sperm (CatSper) leads to impaired sperm motility and male infertility (5Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), and mice lacking the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel type 3 (VDAC3) are also infertile due to immotile sperm (6Sampson M.J.

PMCA represents a family of enzymes that extrude calcium from the cytosol across the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells. Since their initial identification in erythrocytes (13Schatzmann H.J. Experientia (Basel). 1966; 22: 364-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), four different isoforms have been identified, and multiple splice forms of these isoforms have been described. The well defined tissue-specific expression pattern of different isoforms and splice variants of the pump in various mammalian tissues (14Brandt P. Neve R.L. Kammesheidt A. Rhoads R.E. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4376-4385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the regulated expression pattern during mouse development (15Zacharias D.A. Kappen C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1428: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) strongly suggest a specific physiological function for each isoform and splice variant (reviewed in Strehler and Zacharias (16Strehler E.E. Zacharias D.A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar)). The identification of physical and functional interaction partners of the Ca2+ pump has given insights into the putative functions of PMCAs as regulators of Ca2+-dependent signal transduction processes (17Kim E.

Interaction of PMCA2 and -4 “b” splice variants was shown to be mediated by the PDZ-(PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domain of the corresponding interaction partner and the C termini of the PMCA isoform (which harbors a typical PDZ domain binding motif (17Kim E.

Both modes of interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins, specific and promiscuous binding to different PDZ domains, have been demonstrated (18DeMarco S.J. Strehler E.E. J. Biol.

In addition to the overlapping expression pattern of the four PMCA isoforms and the diversity generated by alternative splicing, the specificity of interaction with other proteins adds a further level of complexity in determining the physiological functions of each isoform. Gene ablation in mice using homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells represents one possibility to evaluate the function of proteins in vivo and to address the isoform-specific functions of a certain protein. This strategy has been successfully used to generate PMCA2-deficient mice that suffer from deafness and balance deficits (22Kozel P.J. Friedman R.A. Erway L.C. Yamoah E.N. Liu L.H. Riddle T.

To clarify the in vivo function of PMCA4, we generated PMCA4-deficient mice and studied the physiological effects of this gene deficiency. PMCA4 deficiency does not impair development to adulthood but leads to male infertility due to impaired sperm motility. Cloning of Mouse PMCA4 Isoforms—Mouse PMCA4 isoforms were cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends from a mouse testis Marathon-Ready™ double-stranded cDNA library (catalog number 7455-1, Clontech) using the Advantage® 2 PCR system (Clontech) and the following gene-specific primers: mouse PMCA4 forward, 5′-GTC TGA TCA TGT CTG TCC TCA CAG TTG-3′, and mouse PMCA4 reverse, 5′-GCA GCC CCT CTG GCA CAG CCA CT-3′. Polymerase chain reaction was performed as suggested by the manufacturer, and the resulting PCR fragments were cloned into pCR®-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently sequenced with the standard T7 and M13 reverse primers. The resulting sequences were analyzed and aligned with DNAMAN 4.0 software (Lynnon BioSoft), and the transmembrane helices were predicted with HMMTOP Version 2.0 at www.enzim.hu/hummtop (25Tusnady G.E. Simon I. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2001; 17: 849-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar). Mouse PMCA4b and -4a sequences have been deposited in GenBank™, and the accession numbers are AY560895 and AY560896, respectively. Northern Blotting and Immunofluorescence Stainings—To determine the expression pattern of PMCA4 in mouse testis, we hybridized the MessageMap™ Northern blot (each lane containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA, Stratagene, catalog number 776900) with the 32P-dATP-labeled full-length PMCA4b cDNA according to the manufacturer's protocol and reprobed the subsequently stripped membrane with a 32P-dATP-labeled β-actin probe. The subcellular distribution of PMCA4b was determined by immunofluorescence stainings. Isolated sperm were allowed to swim out from cauda epididymidis in sperm preparation buffer (MediCult, catalog number 10680060) for 15 min, and the suspension was streaked out on poly-lysine-coated slides, air-dried for 10 min, and fixed and stained as described previously (21Schuh K. Uldrijan S. Gambaryan S. Roethlein N. Neyses L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9778-9783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The PMCA4-specific polyclonal antiserum was also described previously (26Stauffer T.P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Generation of PMCA4-deficient Mice—A 12-kb genomic DNA fragment containing exons 2–4 of the mouse PMCA4 gene was isolated from a 129Sv mouse genomic library in the λFix™II vector (Stratagene). The targeting vector was generated by inserting the homologous BglII/KpnI and BspMII/NotI fragments into the pPNT vector (27Tybulewicz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). 20 μg of linearized targeting vector was electroporated into E14.1 embryonic stem cells. Neomycin- and ganciclovir-resistant clones (500 μg/ml G418 and 2 μm ganciclovir) were screened for homologous recombination by Southern blot using the external BamHI/BglII fragment of the mouse PMCA4 gene as a probe (Fig. 3A). This probe hybridizes to a 7.0-kb BamHI fragment (endogenous pmca4 allele) and a 3.3-kb fragment (disrupted allele). Embryonic stem cells that had undergone homologous recombination were injected into C57Bl/6 blastocysts, and the manipulated blastocysts were transferred into pseudo-pregnant foster mice to generate chimeras. Chimeric males were mated to C57Bl/6 females to test for germ line transmission of the targeted PMCA4 allele. PMCA4-deficient mice were obtained by appropriate inbreeding of heterozygous offspring and subsequent genotyping. RT-PCR and Western Blotting—The absence of PMCA4 mRNA in PMCA4-deficient mice was tested by RT-PCR using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) and the following PMCA4-specific (not species-specific) primers: PMCA4 forward, 5′-CTG AGG AAG CTC ATGGAG C-3′, and PMCA4 reverse, 5′-CGG AAA/G TGC TTC TCT TTG C-3′. To test for the absence of PMCA4 at the protein level in sperm, isolated sperm from one cauda epididymidis were collected by centrifugation and boiled for 5 min in 200 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). 20 μl of each lysate was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and the membranes were cut at the level of the 75-kDa protein marker band. The upper half was tested for PMCA4 expression using the PMCA4-specific monoclonal antibody JA9 (28Caride A.J. Filoteo A.G. Enyedi A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (NeoMarkers, 1:500 dilution), and the lower half was probed for actin (polyclonal goat anti-actin, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-1616, 1:500 dilution) to check for equal loading of the samples. Blocking and antibody incubations were done with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline/0.05% Tween 20. Signals were detected with specific horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Tissue Sections of Testis and Histological Stainings—Tissue sections were frozen and prepared as described previously (21Schuh K. Uldrijan S. Gambaryan S. Roethlein N. Neyses L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9778-9783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using a standard protocol. Cytological staining of mouse sperm was carried out using SpermacStain™ (Stain Enterprises Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Fertilization—Sperm were collected from cauda epididymidis in sperm preparation buffer (MediCult) and capacitated in vitro for 2 h at 37 °C. Oocytes were prepared from C57Bl/6 females that had been synchronized with 10 units of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (Sigma) and 10 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma) 48 and 14 h prior to oocyte collection. Eggs were flushed from oviducts in M2 medium (Sigma) and cultivated in M16 medium (Sigma) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. In vitro fertilization capacity was tested as described previously (29Perez G.I. Robles R. Knudson C.M. Flaws J.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Tilly J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In brief, eggs were incubated with ∼105 wild-type or 105 PMCA4-deficient sperm for 24 h at 37 °C, and eggs that had divided to the two-cell stage were counted as indicative of successful fertilization. Estimation of Sperm Motility and Measurement of Intracellular Calcium—Sperm were collected from cauda epididymidis as described above. The supernatant containing sperm was decanted into a fresh tube, and the cells were left untreated at 37 °C for 30 min or loaded with the PMCA inhibitor 5-(and 6)-carboxyeosin diacetate succinimidyl ester (10 μm, Molecular Probes). Overall sperm motility was estimated using the medeaLAB CASA 4.2 system (Erlangen) optimized for mouse sperm. Morphology and tracking threshold upper levels were set to: red 255, green 90, and blue 255, respectively. Additionally, all possible form parameters were deactivated (e.g. flagellum detection, color, and others), and area and form factor filters have been left unchanged. In addition to the classification of sperm motility, average path velocity, progressive velocity, and track speed were calculated with statistical analysis of raw motility data. To estimate intracellular Ca2+ levels in capacitated sperm, they were prepared in sperm preparation buffer (MediCult) as described above, capacitated for 30 min, and loaded with 10 μm Fluo-4-AM for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently washed, counted (Coulter counter), and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml in sperm preparation buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2. Changes in fluorescence were recorded with an excitation wavelength of 494 nm and emission wavelength of 516 nm with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50 B fluorescence photometer using the time drive protocol of the FL Winlab 2.00 software. Intracellular Ca2+ levels after the capacitation period were calculated based on a given dissociation constant KD(Ca2+) = 345 nm of Fluo-4 (Molecular Probes). For calculation of intracellular calcium levels, maximum fluorescence was induced with 50 μm calcium ionophore A3187, and minimal fluorescence was estimated in the presence of 2 mm EDTA in sperm preparation buffer. Full-length cDNA of mouse PMCA4b splice variant and the C terminus of mouse PMCA4a variant were cloned from a testis cDNA library by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Comparison of predicted protein sequences with human (30Strehler E.E. James P. Fischer R. Heim R. Vorherr T. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 306: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) PMCA4b and -4a revealed a high degree of homology (Fig. 1). Mouse PMCA4b contains 10 predicted transmembrane domains, forming a pore in the plasma membrane, which is a typical feature of PMCAs. The C terminus of mouse PMCA4b harbors a typical PDZ domain binding motif (amino acid sequence:... ETPV), most presumably mediating specificity of binding to certain PDZ domains, as shown previously for other human PMCA b splice variants (17Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M.

Sci. 2003; 986: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The C terminus of mouse PMCA4a has a high level of similarity to “a” splice variants of other species (Fig. 1; rat PMCA4a:... PPMGNCSGQSVP, human PMCA4a:... PPVGNQSGQSIS, mouse PMCA4a... PPVGNCSRQTVP). However, the molecular function of this C-terminal PMCA4a motif remains unclear. Although previously shown to be expressed in several organs (14Brandt P. Neve R.L. Kammesheidt A. Rhoads R.E. Vanaman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4376-4385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), multiple tissue Northern blot analysis revealed prominent expression of the PMCA4 messenger RNA in mouse testis (Fig. 2A). In addition, although the relative actin mRNA contents of various tissue types are most likely different, the prominent PMCA4 signal in Fig. 2A suggests robust expression of PMCA4 in mouse testis. A polyclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal part of PMCA4 and cross-reactive with mouse PMCA4 (26Stauffer T.P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) was used to determine subcellular localization of PMCA4 protein in wild-type mouse sperm. The protein was expressed in the principal piece of the sperm tail, the flagellar apparatus propelling the spermatozoon forward, and to a lesser extent to the sickle-shaped mouse sperm acrosome region (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the recently described sperm-specific calcium channel CatSper was also localized in the principal region of the tail, and its gene deletion leads to severely reduced sperm motility and male infertility, thus underlining the important role of Ca2+ signaling in sperm motility (5Ren D. Navarro B. Perez G. Jackson A.C. Hsu S. Shi Q. Tilly J.L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 413: 603-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). To study the physiological function of PMCA4 in vivo, we disrupted the PMCA4 gene in embryonic stem cells by homologous recombination (Fig. 3A). The second exon and part of the third exon were replaced by the neomycin resistance cassette. Following homologous recombination, embryonic stem cells were injected into blastocysts and implanted into pseudo-pregnant foster mice. Following germ line transmission of the mutation, PMCA4-deficient mice were obtained by cross-breeding heterozygous offspring. Disruption of the PMCA4 gene was confirmed by Southern blotting (Fig. 3B), and the absence of the mRNA transcript and of the protein was shown by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3, C and D). Offspring of mated heterozygous males and females were born in the expected Mendelian ratio (26.2% +/+, 46.3% +/–, 27.5% –/–), suggesting that PMCA4 deficiency did not affect embryonic development. PMCA4–/– mice were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates with respect to body weight, appearance, and gross behavior. Adult PMCA4–/– females, mated with wild-type or heterozygous PMCA4+/– males, did not show alterations in fertility (100% fertile). However, a homozygous PMCA4-deficient line could not be established when both homozygous males and females were crossed. Appropriate homo-/heterozygote cross-breeding demonstrated normal female and absent male fertility; 10 PMCA4–/– males engendered no pregnancies over a period of up to 6 months. Alterations in mating behavior or erectile dysfunction were excluded because after mating homozygous knock-out males with PMCA4-deficient females, the latter had a normal frequency of vaginal sperm plugs. A closer microscopical examination of testes and sperm revealed no histological differences in testes architecture and no morphological differences in sperm of PMCA4–/– mice and their wild-type littermates (Fig. 4, A and B). In vitro fertilization assays were performed to test the ability of PMCA4-deficient sperm to fertilize eggs. 38% (10 of 24) of eggs incubated with capacitated wild-type sperm and 35% (11 of 30) of eggs incubated with PMCA4-deficient sperm reached the two-cell-stage after 24 h (example in Fig. 4C). PMCA4-deficient sperm were also able to bind to empty zona pellucida, suggesting that these sperm undergo the normal acrosome reaction (example in Fig. 4C). To gain a first insight into the regulation of intracellular calcium of PMCA4-deficient sperm after capacitation, we have estimated the intracellular calcium after preparation and 60-min capacitation of sperm from caudae epididymides from PMCA4-deficient mice in comparison with sperm of their wild-type littermates. Assuming a KD(Ca2+) of 345 nm for Fluo4, the average intracellular calcium concentration of wild-type sperm was found to be 157 nm, and the intracellular calcium in knock-out sperm was 370 nm (example of one recording given in Fig. 4D, in total n = 15, p < 0.05). This underlines the previously suggested pivotal role of the PMCA in the regulation of basal calcium levels and calcium clearance in sperm (33Wennemuth G. Babcock D.F. Hille B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but detailed analyses of the regulation of intracellular free calcium in different compartments of sperm have to be made to understand the functions of the PMCA4 in the fertilization process. As a consequence of the genetic manipulation, an obvious difference in the motility of mutant and wild-type sperm was observed. Sperm were classified by standard clinical tests for sperm motility disorders with a computer-aided sperm analysis system; a large number of PMCA4-deficient sperm were immotile (68%), displayed extremely low directed progressive motility (14%), or showed no directed movement (18%) as compared with sperm of wild-type littermates (7% immotile, 73% progressive motility, 20% no directed motility, examples of recordings in Fig. 5, A and B). Analysis of main motility parameters showed that average path velocity, progressive velocity, and track speed were severely impaired in PMCA4-deficient mice (Fig. 5D). If deletion of PMCA4 leads to strongly impaired sperm motility, it should conceptually be possible to mimic this effect by using the cell-permeable PMCA inhibitor 5-(and-6)-carboxyeosin diacetate succinimidyl ester (CE). 10 μm CE severely reduced the motility of wild-type sperm (36% immotile, 30% progressive motility, 34% no directed motility, examples of recordings in Fig. 5C, analysis of main motility parameters in Fig. 5D), providing additional evidence for the importance of PMCA activity in the regulation of sperm motility. CE in the concentration range of 10–20 μm has been shown previously to be an effective, specific inhibitor of the plasma membrane calcium pump (34Choi H.S. Eisner D.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 515: 109-118Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Gatto C. Milanick M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1577-C1586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gatto C. Hale C.C. Xu W. Milanick M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we describe a highly specific form of male infertility in animals with a deletion of the PMCA4 gene. The latter is crucial to sperm motility but not to in vitro fertilization capacity. The PMCA inhibitor 5-(and-6)-carboxyeosin diacetate succinimidyl ester mimics the effect of gene deletion on sperm motility. Therefore, it may act as an ideal lead compound for the development of contraceptive drugs and has a number of chemically active side groups that can potentially be used for modification, for example to enhance accumulation in the testis or seminal vesicles and reduce potential side effects. Little is known about the toxicity of 5-(and-6)-carboxyeosin diacetate succinimidyl ester, but the parent compounds eosin and fluorescein are extensively used as a colorant in cosmetics and for diagnostic purposes, respectively, and therefore, they represent a promising class of lead compounds for further contraceptive drug development. Conceptually, our findings may open the way to a novel form of non-hormonal contraception. Furthermore, our findings make PMCA4 a candidate gene for the analysis of genetic and environmental causes of male infertility, an increasing problem globally (37Matzuk M.M. Lamb D.J. Nat.

Cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can delay this apoptosis via increases in the cellular levels of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family with a rapid turnover rate. Here we have shown that inhibition of the proteasome (a) decreases the rate of Mcl-1 turnover within neutrophils and (b) significantly delays apoptosis. This led us to determine whether GM-CSF could enhance neutrophil survival by altering the rate of Mcl-1 turnover. Addition of GM-CSF to neutrophils enhanced Mcl-1 stability and delayed apoptosis by signaling pathways requiring PI3K/Akt and p44/42 Erk/Mek, because inhibitors of these pathways completely abrogated the GM-CSF-mediated effect on both Mcl-1 stability and apoptosis delay. Conversely, induction of Mcl-1 hyperphosphorylation by the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, significantly accelerated both Mcl-1 turnover and apoptosis. Neither the calpain inhibitor, carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal, nor the pan caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethylketone, had any effect on Mcl-1 stability under these conditions. These observations indicate that profound changes in the rate of neutrophil apoptosis following cytokine signaling occur via dynamic changes in the rate of Mcl-1 turnover via the proteasome.

However, if the cells are recruited into tissues and exposed to proinflammatory cytokines, then their rate of apoptosis is delayed and they survive for much longer periods. This delay of apoptosis allows neutrophils to survive for a sufficient period of time to efficiently perform their function in host defense. Subsequent apoptosis of neutrophils is then necessary for the successful resolution of inflammation, and molecular changes on the cell surface of apoptotic neutrophils target them for phagocytosis by tissue macrophages or endothelial cells (6Savill J. Fadok V. Henson P. Haslett C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 131-136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 7Savill J. Haslett C. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, extended neutrophil survival within tissues can result in persistent inflammation and tissue damage if the cells are stimulated to secrete their cytotoxic molecules, such as reactive oxidants and proteases (8Edwards S.W. Hallett M.B. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 320-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 9Edwards S.W. Biochemistry and Physiology of the Neutrophil. Cambridge University Press, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand the processes leading to resolution of acute inflammation it is important to identify the molecular mechanisms by which cytokines delay neutrophil apoptosis. Such information could perhaps lead to the development of new therapies for diseases in which impaired neutrophil apoptosis plays an underlying role in pathology.We have previously shown that neutrophil apoptosis is critically dependent on cellular levels of Mcl-1 (10Moulding D.A. Quayle J.A. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 2495-2502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an anti-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family first identified as an early induction gene expressed during differentiation of ML-1 myeloid cells (11Kozopas K.M.

Levels of Mcl-1 within neutrophils are cytokine-regulated, and antisense disruption of Mcl-1 accelerates both constitutive and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) 1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Mek, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Mek, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.-regulated apoptosis (4Edwards S.W.

Mcl-1 is an unusual member of the Bcl-2 family and has some molecular properties that distinguish it from the other well characterized family members, Bcl-2 and Bcl-X. It is a much larger protein than other family members (40/42 kDa), and its N-terminal region contains PEST sequences and other motifs that target it for turnover by the proteasome (11Kozopas K.M.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Indeed, the half-life of the mature protein is estimated to be between 2 and 3 h, depending upon the cell type and culture conditions (14Moulding D.A. Akgul C. Derouet M. White M.R. Edwards S.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 783-792PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Further, the molecule lacks a BH4 domain, indicating that it must interact with different proteins compared with Bcl-2 and Bcl-X, which both contain this motif. Transcription of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 are independently regulated and are tissue-specific (16Craig R.W. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 444-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 17Johnson A.L. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5465-5468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Krajewski S. Bodrug S. Gascoyne R. Berean K. Krajewska M. Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 515-525PubMed Google Scholar). Mcl-1 is thus a rapidly induced survival protein that is subject to rapid turnover. These properties make it ideally suited to dynamically regulate survival of cells such as neutrophils that are subject to acute regulation of function.We have previously shown that GM-CSF and other proinflammatory cytokines can up-regulate both protein and mRNA levels of mcl-1 in human neutrophils and that GM-CSF can stimulate transcription of the gene in a luciferase reporter assay (14Moulding D.A. Akgul C. Derouet M. White M.R. Edwards S.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 783-792PubMed Google Scholar, 19Akgul C. Turner P.C. White M.R. Edwards S.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, these changes in transcription and mRNA levels were small compared with changes in protein levels seen following GM-CSF treatment. These observations led us to re-examine the processes by which GM-CSF could regulate Mcl-1 protein levels leading to delayed apoptosis. Here, we have shown that manipulation of protein turnover levels within cells (by inhibition of proteasome function) stabilized Mcl-1 levels and delayed neutrophil apoptosis. We have also shown that GM-CSF increases Mcl-1 protein levels by decreasing its rate of turnover via signaling pathways requiring phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and ERK/MEK. Hyperphosphorylation of Mcl-1 greatly accelerated its rate of turnover and, in parallel, considerably accelerated neutrophil apoptosis. These data show, for the first time, that cytokine-mediated neutrophil survival can be controlled by changes in the turnover rate of a normally labile molecule that plays a critical and dynamic role in cell survival.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—RPMI 1640 medium and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen.

After hypotonic lysis to remove contaminating erythrocytes, cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% pooled human male AB serum at 5 × 106/ml. Culture was at 37 °C with gentle agitation. Purity and viability were routinely above 95% as assessed by May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining and trypan blue exclusion, respectively. GM-CSF was added at 50 ng/ml. The following additions were also made as indicated in the text: cycloheximide, 10 μg/ml; MG-132, 50 μm; okadaic acid, 1 μm; cypermethrin, 1 μm; phosphatase inhibitor mixture II, 1:100 dilution; PD 98059, 50 μm; SB202190, 1 μm; wortmannin, 20 nm, H-89, 5 μm; LY294002, 10 μm; GF203109X, 200 nm; ALLN, 100 μm; carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal (MDL 2810), 1 μm; Z-VAD-fmk, 50 μm; lactacystin, 40 μm.Morphological Estimation of Apoptosis—Following culture, a 20-μl aliquot of suspension was made up to 200 μl with RPMI 1640, and cells were cytocentrifuged using a Shandon Cytospin3 (Runcorn, Cheshire, UK). Romanowsky staining of cytospins allowed apoptosis to be scored by morphology as described in Ref. 22Moulding D.A. Giles R.V. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Tidd D.M. Edwards S.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 1756-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. This method correlates well with other markers of apoptosis (23Savill J. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1992; 83: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Annexin V-FITC Staining—Neutrophils (106) were removed from culture and resuspended in Annexin V binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2), before the addition of annexin V-FITC at a 1:100 dilution. After 10 min in the dark, cells were pelleted at 400 × g and resuspended in annexin V binding buffer before analysis by flow cytometry using a Coulter-EpicsAltra flow cytometer. 10000 cells/sample were analyzed.Western Analysis—Following culture, 106 cells were rapidly lysed in boiling reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing aprotinin (20 μg/ml), leupeptin (20 μg/ml), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (400 μg/ml), phosphatase inhibitor set II (1:100 dilution), immediately boiled for 5 min with occasional vortexing, and stored at –80 °C until use. SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were performed as described (24Moulding D.A. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 875-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were: Mcl-1 (13656E), anti-phospho p44/42 (ERK), anti-phospho p38 MAPK, anti-phospho Akt. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera used were donkey anti-rabbit IgG and donkey anti-goat IgG. Bound antibodies were detected using the ECL system. Densitometry on carefully exposed blots (to avoid film saturation) was performed with Image 1.44 VDM software (NIH). Ponceau S-stained actin on membranes after electrotransfer was measured to confirm equivalence of loading of neutrophil samples.Statistics—Data sets were analyzed using the paired Student's t test.RESULTSEffects of Proteasome Inhibition on Mcl-1 Levels and Apoptosis—Previous work has shown that Mcl-1 has a short half-life within cells because PEST sequences within the protein may target it for proteolysis via the proteasome. We therefore tested whether inhibition of proteasome function had any effect on the cellular levels of Mcl-1 and apoptosis in human neutrophils. Neutrophils incubated for 3 h (in the absence of any added agents) had greatly decreased levels of Mcl-1 compared with levels detected in freshly isolated cells (Fig. 1). Levels of Mcl-1 were depleted even further in cultures incubated for 3 h in the presence of cycloheximide to block de novo protein biosynthesis, indicating the rapid turnover of the protein when biosynthesis is inhibited. The addition of GM-CSF maintained cellular levels of this protein, but remarkably, incubation for 3 h with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 resulted in levels of Mcl-1 that were significantly greater than those detected in freshly isolated cells. No changes in the levels of Bax or actin were observed in these experiments, indicating that these latter two proteins were relatively stable within neutrophils. These experiments confirm the idea that the normally short half-life of Mcl-1 is because of its rapid turnover via the proteasome.In view of the proposal that neutrophil cell death and survival is critically dependent on the cellular levels of Mcl-1 (4Edwards S.W. Moulding D.A. Derouet M. Moots R.J. Chem. Immunol. Allergy. 2003; 83: 204-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Moulding D.A. Quayle J.A. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W.

Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 158-166PubMed Google Scholar), we then tested whether manipulation of the levels of this protein by altering its turnover rate had any effect on neutrophil apoptosis. Neutrophils incubated with these same agents were tested in parallel experiments for the appearance of apoptotic features as assessed by annexin V binding or morphology. Cultures of freshly isolated neutrophils contained no apoptotic cells (data not shown), but by 8 h of incubation in the absence of any exogenous agents, over 40% of the cells exhibited apoptotic features as determined by annexin V binding (Fig. 2A) or by morphology (Fig. 2, B and C). When protein biosynthesis was blocked by the addition of cycloheximide, apoptosis was significantly increased to over 75% (±10%, n = 5, p <0.01) as has been reported previously (25Stringer R.E. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W. Brit. J. Haematol. 1996; 92: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Moulding D.A. Quayle J.A. Stringer R.E. Hart C.A. Edwards S.W.

Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The addition of GM-CSF significantly decreased the number of apoptotic cells to 15% (±8%, n = 5); importantly, inhibition of the proteasome by use of the inhibitor MG-132 also significantly decreased the rate of apoptosis of neutrophils. MG-132 also prevented activation of caspase-3 (data not shown). Thus, preventing Mcl-1 turnover by inhibition of proteasome function (Fig. 1) had a parallel effect on delaying neutrophil apoptosis.Fig. 2Inhibition of proteasome function delays neutrophil apoptosis. Neutrophils were incubated for 8 h in the absence (C) or presence of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml, CHX), GM-CSF (50 ng/ml), or MG-132 (50 μm). Apoptosis was then measured by FITC-annexin V binding (A) or morphology (B). Values shown are mean (±S.D.), n = 5.

Life Sci. 2000; 57: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, in view of the striking increases in Mcl-1 levels observed after inhibition of proteasome function, we decided to determine whether GM-CSF could increase cellular levels of Mcl-1 not by increasing de novo biosynthesis but instead by altering its stability and turnover rate. Neutrophils were blocked in de novo biosynthesis by incubation with cycloheximide in the absence and presence of GM-CSF; at time intervals, levels of Mcl-1 were determined by Western blotting. In the absence of GM-CSF, blocking de novo biosynthesis resulted in a rapid decrease in cellular levels of Mcl-1 because of its high turnover rate (Fig. 3), estimated to be ∼2 h in these experiments. In contrast, in the presence of GM-CSF the stability of Mcl-1 was dramatically increased. These experiments clearly indicate that GM-CSF treatment can increase Mcl-1 protein levels by decreasing its rate of turnover via the proteasome.Fig. 3GM-CSF increases Mcl-1 stability in cycloheximide-treated neutrophils. Neutrophils were incubated in the presence of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of GM-CSF (50 ng/ml). At time periods of up to 4 h, samples were removed and Mcl-1 levels were detected by Western blotting. Upper panel shows a representative Western blot; lower panel shows mean data (±S.D.) of relative Mcl-1 levels (taking the signal at time 0 as 100%) of five separate experiments.

Several intracellular signaling systems have been implicated in mediating the effects of GM-CSF on apoptosis delay in neutrophils (1Akgul A.C. Moulding D.A. Edwards S.W.

Levels of activated Erk1/2, p38 MAPK, and Akt were low or undetectable in resting neutrophils (Fig. 4) but rapidly increased following GM-CSF exposure. Maximal activation of Erk1/2 and Akt occurred within 3 min of addition of cytokine, whereas maximal activation of p38-MAPK occurred by 7 min (Fig. 4A). Levels of activated Erk1/2 and Akt were maintained for about 30 min but then declined to basal levels by 5 h after stimulation (Fig. 4B). However, levels of activated p38-MAPK showed more complex changes (Fig. 4C). After initial stimulation, levels of activated p38-MAPK decreased but transiently increased again by ∼2 h after GM-CSF treatment and again by 5 h poststimulation. This pattern of transient activation was consistently seen in seven separate experiments with neutrophils isolated from different donors. Control experiments indicated that p38-MAPK became slowly activated by 4–5 h culture in untreated cells, even in the absence of GM-CSF. However, the transient activation seen at 2–3 h was only seen following GM-CSF treatment. These experiments confirm a number of putative kinase signaling pathways activated by GM-CSF; hence it was necessary to determine whether any of these played a role in regulating Mcl-1 stability.Fig. 4GM-CSF results in transient activation of MAPKs. Neutrophils were incubated with GM-CSF (50 ng/ml); at the time intervals indicated (short term (A) or long term (B, C), samples were analyzed for levels of activated Erk, p38-MAPK, and Akt by Western blotting. C, neutrophils were incubated in the presence (+) and absence (–) of GM-CSF prior to measurement of activated p38-MAPK levels. Total p38-MAPK levels were also measured in GM-CSF-treated cells. Results are typical of three to five separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Neutrophils were therefore treated with a panel of signaling inhibitors to test for their ability to affect GM-CSF signaling of enhanced Mcl-1 stability and apoptosis. Cells were incubated with cycloheximide to block protein biosynthesis in the presence and absence of GM-CSF and the inhibitors. After 2 h of incubation with cycloheximide alone, cellular levels of Mcl-1 had decreased to ∼40% of the time 0 levels, again indicating rapid turnover of the protein in the absence of de novo biosynthesis (Fig. 5, A and B). In the presence of GM-CSF, the turnover of Mcl-1 was slowed; when proteasome activity was blocked with MG-132, protein levels were increased further, indicating negligible turnover. Blocking the activity of p38-MAPK had no effect on the GM-CSF-dependent increase in Mcl-1 stability. In contrast, blocking the activities of Erk/Mek and PI3K with PD98059 and wortmannin (or LY294002, data not shown), respectively, completely abrogated the GM-CSF-mediated increase in Mcl-1 stability. Thus, in the presence of these latter inhibitors, the turnover rate of Mcl-1 was identical to that measured in cycloheximide-only treated cultures. The stability changes in Mcl-1 following GM-CSF exposure require signals generated via Erk/Mek and PI3K/Akt. No effects on Mcl-1 turnover rate were observed after the addition of H89 (an inhibitor of protein kinase A) or GF203109X (an inhibitor of protein kinase C) (data not shown).Fig. 5The GM-CSF-mediated stability increase in Mcl-1 is signaled through Erk/Mek and PI3K/Akt. Neutrophils were incubated for 0 or 2 h in the presence of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). GM-CSF (50 ng/ml) was added as indicated in the absence or presence of MG-132 (MG, 50 μm), PD98059 (PD, 50 μm), SB202190 (SB, 1 μm), or wortmannin (Wort, 20nm).

After 8 h of incubation in the presence of cycloheximide, ∼80% of the cells were apoptotic as assessed by annexin V binding or morphology (Fig. 5C). Even when cells were blocked in protein biosynthesis, GM-CSF could still significantly delay apoptosis; when proteasome function was inhibited (with MG-132), the protective effect of GM-CSF was even greater. The p38-MAPK inhibitor SB202190 had little effect on this GM-CSF-regulated effect on apoptosis. In contrast, PD98059 and wortmannin (or LY294002, data not shown) completely abrogated the protective effects of GM-CSF on neutrophil apoptosis in these cycloheximide-treated cells.It was then necessary to determine whether other proteolytic processes known to function in neutrophils had any effect on the turnover of Mcl-1. The pan caspase inhibitor Z-FAD-fmk had no effect on Mcl-1 turnover when cells were incubated with cycloheximide in the absence or presence of GM-CSF (Fig. 6, A and B). Similarly, the cell-permeable calpain inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal (33Fukiage C. Azuma M. Nakamura Y. Tamada Y. Nakamura M. Shearer T.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) had no effect on Mcl-1 turnover under these experimental conditions. However, ALLN (known to inhibit calpains and the proteasome) (34Murray E.J. Tram K.K. Murray S.S. Lee D.B.

Taken together, these observations indicate a role for the proteasome, but not calpains nor caspases, in regulating Mcl-1 turnover in neutrophils.Fig. 6The proteasome, but not caspases or calpains, regulates Mcl-1 turnover.

The Sun2 antibody signal co-localizes with nuclear pore and INM markers signals. The rim-like pattern was also observed with the recombinant full-length Sun2 protein fused to either EGFP or V5 epitopes. In addition, we found that a recombinant truncated form of Sun2, extending from amino acids 26 to 339, is sufficient to specify the nuclear envelope localization. Biochemical analyses show that Sun2 is an 85-kDa protein that is partially insoluble in detergent with high salt concentration and in chaotropic agents. Furthermore, Sun2 is enriched in purified HeLa cell nuclei. Electron microscopy analysis shows that Sun2 localizes in the nuclear envelope with a sub-population present in small clusters. Additionally, we show that the SUN domain of Sun2 is localized to the periplasmic space between the inner and the outer nuclear membranes. From our data, we conclude that Sun2 is a new mammalian inner nuclear membrane protein.

https://openalex.org/W2014408822,"Accumulating evidences indicate that p120 catenin, a member of the E-cadherin (E-CD)/catenin adhesion complex, plays a role in tumor invasion. To establish the expression pattern of p120 in breast cancer, we analysed 326 breast tissue biopsies by tissue microarray. Most of the lobular tumors (88%) showed exclusive cytoplasmic localization, and 6% of them also had p120 nuclear staining. Cytoplasmic p120 strongly associated with complete loss of E-CD and β-catenin not only in lobular carcinoma and its metastases but also in atypical lobular hyperplasias. In the latter, loss of heterozygosity of E-CD gene was also observed. Complete loss of E-CD and cytoplasmic and nuclear p120 staining was also observed in primary lobular cancer cell cultures generated by us. In ductal tumors, by contrast, reduction of p120 and E-CD in membrane was very common (57 and 53%, respectively), whereas cytoplasmic p120 staining was rarely seen. This simultaneous reduction of membranous E-CD and p120 was not associated with increased Src kinase activity. To demonstrate that cytoplasmic p120 localization was a consequence of the absence of E-CD, the endogenous E-CD was re-expressed in MDA-231 cells by 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5Aza) treatment. After treatment, p120 shifted from the cytoplasm to the membrane, where it colocalized with endogenous E-CD. Additionally, suppressing E-CD expression in Madin–Darby canine kidney cells by stable transfection of the transcriptional repressors Snail, E47 or Slug, provokes p120 cytoplasmic localization and p120 isoform switching. In conclusion, abnormal cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of p120, which are mediated by the absence of E-CD, characteristically occur in the early stages of lobular breast cancer and are maintained during tumor progression to metastasis. Consequently, p120 may be an important mediator of the oncogenic effects derived from E-CD inactivation, including enhanced motility and invasion, in lobular breast cancer."

They contain membrane microdomains, often referred to as lipid rafts and/or caveolae, enriched in glycosphingolipids (GSLs), 1The abbreviations used are: GSL, glycosphingolipid; BODIPY, 5,7-dimethylborondipyrromethene difluoride; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; LacCer, lactosylceramide; GM3, Neu5Acα3Galβ4GlcCer; GM2, Gal-NAcβ4(Neu5Acα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GcGM2, GalNAcβ4(Neu5Gcα3)Galβ4-GlcCer; GcGM1a, Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Gcα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GM1a, Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GM1b, Neu5Acα3Galβ3Gal-NAcβ4Galβ4GlcCer; GD1a, Neu5Acα3Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu8Acα3)Gal-β4GlcCer; GD1b, Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα8Neu5Acα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GT1b Neu5Acα3Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα8Neu5Acα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GQ1b, Neu5Acα3Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα8Neu5Acα8Neu5Acα3)Gal-β4GlcCer; GA2, GalNAcβ4Galβ4GlcCer; GA1, Galβ4GalNAcβ4Gal-β4GlcCer; Gb3, Galα4Galβ4GlcCer; Gb4 GalNAcβ4Galα4Galβ4GlcCer; NPC1, Niemann-Pick type C protein 1; NB-DGJ, N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: GSL, glycosphingolipid; BODIPY, 5,7-dimethylborondipyrromethene difluoride; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; LacCer, lactosylceramide; GM3, Neu5Acα3Galβ4GlcCer; GM2, Gal-NAcβ4(Neu5Acα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GcGM2, GalNAcβ4(Neu5Gcα3)Galβ4-GlcCer; GcGM1a, Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Gcα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GM1a, Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GM1b, Neu5Acα3Galβ3Gal-NAcβ4Galβ4GlcCer; GD1a, Neu5Acα3Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu8Acα3)Gal-β4GlcCer; GD1b, Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα8Neu5Acα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GT1b Neu5Acα3Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα8Neu5Acα3)Galβ4GlcCer; GQ1b, Neu5Acα3Galβ3GalNAcβ4(Neu5Acα8Neu5Acα8Neu5Acα3)Gal-β4GlcCer; GA2, GalNAcβ4Galβ4GlcCer; GA1, Galβ4GalNAcβ4Gal-β4GlcCer; Gb3, Galα4Galβ4GlcCer; Gb4 GalNAcβ4Galα4Galβ4GlcCer; NPC1, Niemann-Pick type C protein 1; NB-DGJ, N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. specific proteins, and cholesterol (1Tillack T.W.

Being operationally defined, i.e. by detergent insolubility and low buoyant density, the natural (in situ) existence of such membrane microdomains has been and continues to be controversial (4Munro S. Cell. 2003; 115: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). However, they have recently been visualized by using electron microscopy as small structures covering as much as 35% of the cell surface (5Prior I.A. Muncke C. Parton R.G. Hancock J.F. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Although membrane microdomains on the cell surface tend to be transient (6Schutz G.J. Kada G. Pastushenko V.P. Schindler H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 892-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), relatively stable microdomains have been visualized in the endocytic pathway (7Sharma D.K. Choudhury A. Singh R.D. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7564-7572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) where they are proposed to play a role in protein and lipid sorting (8Gruenberg J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Many GSL storage diseases, including Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), are often characterized by enlarged liver and spleen as well as severe neurodegeneration. In these diseases, cholesterol and GSLs accumulate in the endocytic pathway because of reduced breakdown. Hence, they may be a useful tool for determining the relative importance of GSLs in endocytic transport. Fibroblasts from patients suffering from GSL storage diseases do show altered endocytic sorting (9Chen C.S. Patterson M.C. Wheatley C.L. O'Brien J.F. Pagano R.E. Lancet. 1999; 354: 901-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the accumulation of endocytic membrane microdomains may be the basis for altered endocytic sorting (10Simons K. Gruenberg J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 459-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It is possible that accumulating membrane microdomains in storage bodies mislocalizes microdomain proteins involved in signaling and transport, precluding normal function (10Simons K. Gruenberg J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 459-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 11Nix M. Stoffel W. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the relative importance of GSLs and proteins in membrane microdomain formation is still not known (12Ostermeyer A.G. Beckrich B.T. Ivarson K.A. Grove K.E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34459-34466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 13Lai E.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Annexins 2 and 6 are lipid-binding proteins that are widely involved in facilitating intracellular transport, including endocytic trafficking, and are reported to associate with membrane microdomains (14Moss S.E.

Cell Res. 2001; 269: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteins involved in both early and late endocytic transport have been shown already to be inhibited in NPC disease. Annexin 2 normally localizes to early endosomes but has been shown to be mislocalized because of lipid accumulation in late endosomes in NPC disease (15Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Rab 7, a protein involved in endocytic transport from late endosomes, is also compromised as a result of lipid storage (24Choudhury A. Dominguez M. Puri V. Sharma D.K. Narita K. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 1541-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 25Lebrand C. Corti M. Goodson H. Cosson P. Cavalli V. Mayran N. Faure J. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In this study, we have quantified the levels of GSLs, sphingosine, and cholesterol that occur in lipid rafts (the detergent-insoluble fraction) isolated from various organs of a mouse model of Niemann-Pick C (NPC1) disease by HPLC and mass spectrometry. Raft-associated GSLs increased in all tissues. Cholesterol and sphingosine increased in non-neuronal tissues. GSL-lowering therapy, using imino sugar inhibitors of GSL synthesis, is effective in the treatment of a mouse model of NPC disease (26Zervas M. Somers K.L. Thrall M.A. Walkley S.U. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1283-1287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In NPC cell culture models, inhibition of GSL synthesis ablated the accumulation of GSLs but had little effect on cholesterol levels. However, phenotypes associated with NPC, such as annexin 2 mislocalization, decreased uptake of fluid phase markers (15Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and altered BODIPY LacCer trafficking (9Chen C.S. Patterson M.C. Wheatley C.L. O'Brien J.F. Pagano R.E. Lancet. 1999; 354: 901-905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) were all reversed by inhibition of GSL synthesis. At least under conditions of intracellular storage, the accumulation of GSLs appears intimately linked to the perturbation of endocytic transport. HPLC-grade acetonitrile, methanol, chloroform, and butanol were from VWR Scientific (Poole, UK). Acetone was from Fisher. Tissue culture media and supplements were from Invitrogen. o-Phthaldialdehyde and progesterone were from Sigma. Tetrabutylammonium was from Fluka (Zwijndrecht, Netherlands). C:17-sphingosine 1-phosphate was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). U18666A was from Affiniti Research Chemicals (Exeter, UK), and NB-DGJ was from Toronto Research Chemicals (Ontario, Canada). Annexin 2 and 6 antibodies were purchased from TD Labs (Oxford, UK), and secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and EC-RF24 endothelial cells were grown to confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were dissociated with trypsin/EDTA and were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/cm2 in an atmosphere of air/CO2 (19:1) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in 10-cm dishes. CT43 and RA25 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were a gift of TY Chang, Dartmouth Medical School. The CT43 cell line is a cholesterol trafficking mutant defective in the NPC1 protein. The RA25 cell line is the parental cell line and has a normal NPC1 allele. Both sets of cells contain a gain of function mutation in SCAP, resulting in resistance to sterol-dependent transcriptional regulation. CHO cells seeded in Ham's F-12 Glutamax-I medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin, were grown as monolayers at 37 °C with 5% CO2. RAW 264.1 and J774.A1 mouse macrophages were obtained from the ECACC (Porton Down, UK) and maintained at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI supplemented with 10 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Animals—npc1NIH spontaneous mutant mice on the BALB/cJ background (27Pentchev P.G. Boothe A.D. Kruth H.S. Weintroub H. Stivers J. Brady R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5784-5791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (denominated as NPC1–/– mice in this paper) were maintained by brother-sister mating of heterozygous animals. At weaning (21 days), tail tips were removed for DNA preparation. PCR was used to determine genotypes at the npc1 locus using the following primer pairs: IMR928 and IMR929, expected fragment size, 173 bp; annealing temperature was 55 or 57 °C; IMR928 5′ CTG TAG CTC ATC TGC CAT CG 3′ and IMR929 5′ TCT CAC AGC CAC AAG CTT CC 3′. IMR927 and MP258F, expected fragment size, 475 bp. Annealing temperature was 53 °C; IMR927 5′ TGA GCC CAA GCA TAA CTT CC 3′ and IMP258F 5′ GGT GCT GGA CAG CCA AGT A 3′. NPC1–/– mice developed disease symptoms between 6 and 7 weeks of age, and tissues were harvested at 10 weeks of age. Membrane Microdomain Isolation—Membrane microdomains were purified by the method of Lisanti et al. (28Lisanti M.P. Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Sargiacomo M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 655-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues were homogenized by 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer in 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 in 25 mm Mes-buffered saline (pH 6.5) and incubated for 30 min on ice. The solution made up to 40% sucrose and transferred to a Beckman Ultraclear 14 × 89-mm tube on ice with a discontinuous gradient of 5 ml of 30% sucrose and 3 ml of 5% sucrose layered on top. Samples were ultracentrifuged in an SW41 rotor at 100 000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C, and 2-ml fractions were manually collected. Purification of GSLs for HPLC and Mass Spectrometry—GSLs were extracted by addition of 3.2 volumes of CHCl3/MeOH (1:2.2) for 10 min at room temperature followed by the addition of 1 volume of CHCl3 and 1 volume of H2O (29Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). This rapid extraction procedure gives similar recoveries of GSLs to other commonly used methods of lipid extraction (30van Echten G. Iber H. Stotz H. Takatsuki A. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 51: 135-139PubMed Google Scholar, 31Miller Podraza H. Mansson J.E. Svennerholm L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Upper phase GSLs were then recovered by SepPak™ C18 columns (32Sillence D.J. Raggers R.J. Neville D.C.A. Harvey D.J. van Meer G. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1252-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, C18 SepPak columns (Waters, Milford, MA) were washed with 1 ml of MeOH and 1 ml of water. The CHCl3 phase was dried down and loaded in 50 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:3). The corresponding aqueous phase was loaded onto the columns and washed five times with 1 ml of water. GSLs were then eluted five times with 1 ml of CHCl3/MeOH (1:3) and 1 ml of MeOH, and the samples were dried under nitrogen. At this point the cholesterol and GSLs were quantified as described below. For mass spectrometry, the samples were saponified by the addition of 1 ml of CHCl3 and 1 ml of 0.2 m NaOH in MeOH, incubated overnight at 37 °C, and further purified by silicic acid chromatography (33Vance D.E. Sweeley C.C. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Silicic acid columns were pre-equilibrated in CHCl3, and the samples were loaded onto the column and washed with 5 ml of CHCl3. Neutral GSLs were eluted with 6 ml of acetone/MeOH (9:1). Gangliosides were eluted with 6 ml of CHCl3/MeOH (1:3), and the eluates were dried under nitrogen. The samples were resuspended one time with 50 μl and then one time with 100 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:2.2) and transferred to a 1.5-ml tube. The samples were dried down in a SpeedVac and resuspended in 20 μl of MeOH. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry was performed as described previously (34Hunnam V. Harvey D.J. Priestman D.A. Bateman R.H. Bordoli R.S. Tyldesley R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Cholesterol—Cholesterol was quantitated by using a method similar to that of Franey and Amador (35Franey R.J. Amador E. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1968; 21: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Samples were resuspended in 50 μl of EtOH and transferred to a microtiter plate along with cholesterol standards (1 mg/ml in ethanol) in duplicate and dried briefly at 80 °C. After the addition of 75 μl of 3 mm FeCl3·6H20 in glacial acetic acid and 50 μl of concentrated H2SO4, the plate was incubated for 10 min in the dark and the absorbance read at 570 nm. Extraction and Quantitation of Sphingoid Bases by HPLC—Sphingoid bases were extracted and quantified by the method of Merrill et al. (36Merrill A.H. Caligan T.B. Wang E. Peters K. Ou J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 3-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissues or membrane microdomain fractions were extracted with butanol containing 1% v/v concentrated HCl and dried under nitrogen. Samples were saponified by the addition of 1 ml of chloroform and 1 ml of 0.2 m NaOH in methanol and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Lipids were dried under nitrogen, 0.5 ml of water, 1 ml of 1-butanol; 20 μl of concentrated HCl was added, and the upper phase was removed. This procedure was repeated several times, and the combined extract was dried under nitrogen. Sphingoid bases were derivatized with o-phthaldialdehyde in boric acid for 20 min at room temperature, centrifuged at low speed, and 300 μl of the supernatant transferred to a Waters autosampler vial. 100 μl of the derivatized lipids were injected onto a Waters 5 μmC18 8 × 100 mm column, pore size 100 Å (Waters, Milford, MA). Samples were eluted isocratically with filtered and degassed methanol, 10 mm K2H2PO4 (pH 7.4), 0.5 m tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (83:16:1, v/v) as the mobile phase. A flow rate of 1.2 ml/min was maintained, and the fluorescence was monitored for 120 min at λex 340 nm and λem 455 nm. Quantitation of GSL Derivatives by HPLC—GSLs were analyzed according to Neville et al. (37Neville D.C.A. Coquard V. Priestman D.A. te Vruchte D. Sillence D.J. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Butters T.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly dried lipid extracts were resuspended in 10 μl of incubation buffer (1 mg/ml sodium cholate in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0)). After vigorous vortexing and spinning in a benchtop picofuge, 10 μl of 50 milliunits/10 μl of ceramide glycanase (EC 3.2.1.123, Calbiochem) in incubation buffer was added to cleave the glycans. Glucosylceramide is partially digested because of the specificity of the glycanase (37Neville D.C.A. Coquard V. Priestman D.A. te Vruchte D. Sillence D.J. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Butters T.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). After 18 h, 10 μl of water was added to each enzyme digest followed by 80 μl of anthranilic acid (30 mg/ml) and sodium cyanoborohydride (45 mg/ml) to each digest and incubated for 1 h at 80 °C. Derivatized oligosaccharides were purified on DPA-6S (Supelco, Ballafonte, PA), and columns were pre-equilibrated two times with 1 ml of CH3CN. 1 ml of 97:3 CH3CN/H2O was added to each sample and vortexed prior to loading. Columns were washed four times with 1 ml of 99:1 CH3CN/H2O, 0.5 ml of 97:3 CH3CN/H2O, and the derivatized oligosaccharides were eluted two times with 0.6 ml of water into screwcap Eppendorf and stored at 4 °C in the dark until ready for normal phase-HPLC using a Waters Alliance 2695 separations module, an in-line Waters 474 fluorescence detector separation and a 4.6 × 250 mm TSK gel-Amide 80 column (Anachem, Luton, UK). Immunocytochemistry—J774 and CHO cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/coverslip (22 mm) and allowed to adhere overnight. Coverslips were washed twice in PBS prior to fixation with 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. Coverslips were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. Monolayers were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml primary mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for annexin 2 or 6 in blocking solution for 45 min, followed by three washes in PBS (5 min each wash), and incubation with 5 μg/ml Alexa-Fluor 488 (annexin 2) or 564 (annexin 6)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min. Samples were washed three times in PBS (5 min each wash) followed by mounting in Vectashield. Fluorescent cells were observed using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope. Images were collected using a charge-coupled device camera. Cholesterol Staining—Monolayers on coverslips were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min followed by quenching in medium. Cells were incubated with 125 μg/ml filipin (a cytochemical probe specific for cholesterol) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by three washes with PBS and mounting in Vectashield. Fluid Phase Endocytosis—Cellular uptake of HRP was performed as described (15Mayran N. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3242-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 38Gu F. Gruenberg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8154-8160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). RAW, J774, RA25, and CT43 cells were treated with 2 μg/ml U18666A or 10 μg/ml progesterone for 18 h in the absence and presence of 100 μm NB-DGJ. Cells were then incubated with 3 mg/ml HRP for 2 h at 37 °C followed by extensive washing at 4 °C, and HRP was assayed using a commercial peroxidase kit (Pierce). Structural Confirmation and Quantitation of GSLs by HPLC—The changes in total GSL levels between NPC1+/+ and NPC1–/– mice were initially analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (34Hunnam V. Harvey D.J. Priestman D.A. Bateman R.H. Bordoli R.S. Tyldesley R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). No large differences in fatty acid composition could be detected between normal and NPC1–/– brain, liver, and spleen tissues (not shown). GSLs were extracted and digested by ceramide glycanase (37Neville D.C.A. Coquard V. Priestman D.A. te Vruchte D. Sillence D.J. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. Butters T.D. Anal. Biochem. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) followed by derivatization, separation, and quantitation of the resultant oligosaccharides by HPLC (Fig. 1). For instance, normal mouse brain GSLs were found to be similar to those reported previously with GM1a, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b predominating and lower levels of LacCer, GA2, GM3, and GM2 (Fig. 1) (39Waki H. Kon K. Tanaka Y. Ando S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, in brains from NPC1–/– mice, GSLs increased, including GM2, GA2, GM3, and LacCer in agreement with studies employing thin layer chromatography (40Pentchev P.G. Gal A.E. Boothe A.D. Fouks J. Omodeo-Sale F. Brady R.O. Birth Defects Orig. Artic. Ser. 1980; 16: 225-230PubMed Google Scholar, 41Liu Y. Wu Y.P. Wada R. Neufeld E.B. Mullin K.A. Howard A.C. Pentchev P.G. Vanier M.T. Suzuki K. Proia R.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Glycosphingolipids in NPC1–/–Mice Accumulate in Membrane Microdomains—Because GSLs are thought to be important components of membrane microdomains, we investigated whether they accumulated in microdomains in the NPC mouse tissues. All the GSLs were found to be highly enriched in membrane microdomains (Table I). Membrane microdomains from the cerebrum, cerebellum, liver, and spleen were purified by the Triton X-100 detergent procedure using sucrose gradients. In the brains of NPC1–/– mice GSLs increased in agreement with the mass spectrometric and HPLC analysis of the total levels (Fig. 1). The fold increases were broadly similar to that found in total GSL levels in human NPC patients (42Vanier M.T. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Similar increases were seen in cerebellum (Table I). Table I also shows the levels of membrane microdomain GSLs in NPC1–/– liver and spleen.

Open table in a new tab Cholesterol in NPC1–/–Mice Accumulates in Membrane Microdomains—During the last 20 years NPC has been viewed as a cholesterol storage disease. We determined whether the elevated cholesterol that occurred in NPC was enriched in membrane microdomains. Up to 90% of the cholesterol was found in membrane microdomains (the detergent-insoluble low density fraction) in both normal and NPC1–/– tissues (Table II). Table II shows that membrane microdomain cholesterol levels varied in control mice between different tissues, and large increases (4–10-fold) in cholesterol could be detected in NPC1–/– liver and spleen, similar to that found in human patients (43Vanier M.T.

https://openalex.org/W1988943863,"The innate immune response in vertebrates and invertebrates requires the presence of pattern recognition receptors or proteins that recognize microbial cell components including lipopolysaccharide, bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN), and fungal 1,3-β-d-glucan. We reported previously that PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan recognition proteins from insect hemolymph were able to induce the activation of the prophenoloxidase-activating system, one of the major invertebrate innate immune reactions. The goal of this study was to characterize the biochemical properties and effects of the human counterparts of these molecules. Soluble pattern recognition proteins were purified from human serum and identified as human mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and l-ficolin. The use of specific microbial cell component-coupled columns demonstrated that MBL and l-ficolin bind to PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan, respectively. Purified MBL and l-ficolin were associated with MBL-associated serine proteases-1 and -2 (MASPs) and small MBL-associated protein as determined by Western blot analysis. Finally, the binding of purified MBL/MASP and l-ficolin/MASP complexes to PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan, respectively, resulted in the activation of the lectin-complement pathway. These results indicate that human PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan recognition proteins function as complement-activating lectins.

Innate immune responses in animals are mediated by specific pattern recognition receptors or proteins that recognize microbe-specific pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules such as lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan (PGN), 1The abbreviations used are: PGN, peptidoglycan; MBL, mannose-binding lectin; MASP, MBL-associated serine protease; sMAP, small MBL-associated protein; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition protein; pro-PO, prophenoloxidase. lipoteichoic acid, mannan, and 1,3-β-d-glucan (1Medzhitov R.

This process also occurs in mammals where secreted pattern recognition proteins such as mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins (l-ficolin and H-ficolin) bind to microbial cells. In human plasma, MBL and ficolins are associated with three types of serine protease termed MBL-associated serine protease (MASP), MASP-1, MASP-2, and MASP-3, and a truncated form of MASP-2 called small MBL-associated protein (sMAP). The complexes promote the elimination of microbes through activation of phagocytosis or the lectin pathway of the complement system (5Holmskov U. Thiel S. Jensenius J.C. Annu. Rev.

Further, pattern recognition receptors expressed on the cell surface, including the family of Toll-like receptors, can activate signaling pathways that induce antimicrobial effectors responses and inflammation upon recognition of different pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules (1Medzhitov R.

PGN is a key component of the bacterial cell wall. It is composed of polymeric sugar chains consisting of alternating 1,4-β-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid residues that are cross-linked with shorts peptides (7Rogers H.J. Perkins H.R. Ward J.B. Roger H.J. Microbial Cell Wall and Membranes. Chapman & Hall, London1980: 190-382Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that PGN activates host cells through the membrane-associated pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor-2 (8Schwandner R. Dziarski R. Wesche H.

The cloning of genes encoding vertebrate PGN recognition proteins (PGRPs) demonstrated that there is a high degree of sequence conservation between insects and mammalian species (13Yoshida H.

They can activate the complement and/or cytokine system, stimulate the reticuloendothelial system, induce hematopoiesis, inhibit tumor cell growth, and induce resistance to infections (for review see Refs. 22Sakurai T.

Here, to further characterize human PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan recognition molecules, we purified two kinds of complement-related proteins from the human serum by using PGN- and 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled columns and characterizing their biochemical properties. We found that human MBL and l-ficolin function as secreted pattern recognition proteins for PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan, respectively. Preparation of Soluble PGN-coupled Sepharose 4B and 1,3-β-d-Glucan-coupled Toyopearl Resin—A PGN-coupled column was prepared as described previously (17Lee M.H. Osaki T. Lee J.Y. Baek M.J. Zhang R.

Soluble PGN fragments were prepared from Staphylococcus aureus insoluble PGN (Fluka Chemie, Steinheim, Germany) according to the published method (30Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One milligram of the lyophilized soluble PGN was coupled to 0.4 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol, and the PGN-coupled Sepharose binding ability was assessed using recombinant Holotrichia diomphalia PGRP-1 (17Lee M.H. Osaki T. Lee J.Y. Baek M.J. Zhang R. Park J.W. Kawabata S.I. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3218-3227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Resins with a binding capability of >10 μg of H. diomphalia PGRP-1 per 1-g resin were used for the purification of PGN recognition proteins in human serum. As a control, CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B that had been inactivated with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. A 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled column was also prepared as described previously (31Zhang R. Cho H.Y. Kim H.S. Ma Y.G. Osaki T. Kawabata S.I. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol.

To block any remaining free amino groups, the gels was acetylated by incubation with 8 ml of 0.2 m sodium acetate and 4 ml of acetic anhydride for 30 min on ice followed by the addition of 4 ml of acetic anhydride and another 30 min of incubation at room temperature. Finally, the resin was washed sequentially with 150 ml of 0.1 m NaOH, 150 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and distilled water. Resin without curdlan served as a control. The amount of 1,3-β-d-glucan coupled to the resins was quantified by the sulfuric acid-phenol method (32Rao P. Pattabiraman T.N. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 181: 18-22Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Resins that coupled >3 μg of glucose per 1-mg resin were used for purification of human 1,3-β-d-glucan recognition proteins. Purification of Human PGN Recognition Proteins—Human plasma was obtained from volunteer donors who had provided written informed consent at the Busan Blood Center (Busan, Korea). The study was performed under the approval for research on human subjects obtained from the Pusan National University. A final concentration of 10 mm CaCl2 was added to the plasma sample followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Resulting fibrin clots were removed using sterilized gauze and discarded. The fibrin-excluded serum (100 ml) was precipitated with 8 g of polyethylene glycol 4000 (Sigma). After centrifugation at 9,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the precipitates were dissolved in 15 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 200 mm NaCl, and 20 mm CaCl2) and then divided into two batches. Each batch then was loaded on a PGN-coupled Sepharose 4B and control-Sepharose 4B columns that had been equilibrated with buffer A. Both columns were washed with buffer A until the absorbance at 280 nm was zero. Bound proteins were eluted from each column using buffer A containing 0.3 m GlcNAc followed by buffer A containing 0.3 m mannose at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The protein profiles in aliquots of eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and fractions containing a 30-kDa protein band were pooled. The pooled fractions were passed through a protein A-attached Sepharose CL 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with buffer A, and the flow-through fractions were passed subsequently through an anti-IgM-coupled Sepharose 4B column. The purified 30-kDa protein was separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for determination of the amino-terminal sequence. For internal amino acid sequencing, proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gels were stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 50% methanol and destained with 30% methanol. The 30-kDa protein band was excised and treated with lysylendopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemicals) according to the method described by Wilm et al. (33Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). The resulting digest was subjected to reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Gilson, WI) using a C18 high performance liquid chromatography column (Tosho). High performance liquid chromatography was performed with a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 75 min at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, and the prominent peaks were sequenced using an automatic amino acid sequencer (Procise, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Purification of 1,3-β-d-Glucan Recognition Proteins—Human serum was precipitated with polyethylene glycol as described above and dissolved in buffer A. Samples then were loaded onto a 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled Toyopearl column equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A until the absorbance at 280 nm was zero, and bound proteins were sequentially eluted with buffer A containing 0.3 m glucose, 0.3 m mannose, and 0.3 m GlcNAc. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The fractions most enriched in the 35-kDa band were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the amino-terminal sequence or partial amino acid sequences of this protein were determined as described above. Immobilization of Soluble PGN Fragments—Carboxyl-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 96-well microplates (Sumitomo Bakelite, Tokyo, Japan) were activated with 100 μl of water-soluble carbodiimide (10 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 5.8) by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. The wells were washed three times with 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and 100 μl of soluble PGN was added to each well (∼3 μg of lyophilized-soluble PGN fragments) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. The wells then were washed with 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 7.6). Microplates without PGN served as controls. Immobilization of 1,3-β-d-Glucan—Amino-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 96-well microplates coupled with 1,3-β-d-glucan were prepared by adding 200 μl of soluble curdlan solution to each well and incubating the plates at 60 °C for 30 min. 100 μl of a NaBH3CN solution (20 mg of NaBH3CN dissolved in 0.2 m K2HPO4, (pH 9.4)) was added next to each well and incubated at 60 °C for 14 h. Wells were washed three times with distilled water, twice with 100 mm of boric acid (pH 8.2), and another three times with distilled water. 160 μl of 0.4 m sodium acetate and 160 μl of acetic anhydride were added next to each well, and the plates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 300 μl of acetic anhydride was added followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. The wells were washed three times with distilled water, three times with 0.1 m NaOH, three times with 1 m of Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and another six times with distilled water.

The membranes were then transferred to a solution containing antibodies against MASP-1 (50 μg/ml) or MASP-2 (5 μg/ml) and then incubated at 4 °C for 2 h and then later with horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit-goat IgG conjugate as secondary antibody (1:3,000, Amersham Biosciences). The bound antibodies were detected using an ECL Western blotting reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). Binding Assays—PGN-and 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled microplates were blocked with Block-Ace (0.3 ml, Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan), and the purified human MBL/MASP or l-ficolin/MASP (4 μg of protein/100 μl in TBST) complexes were diluted with TBST containing 10 mm CaCl2 and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing with TBST, a biotinylated anti-MBL monoclonal antibody (3E7) (37Terai I. Kabayashi K. Fujita T. Hagiwara K. Biochem. Med. Metabol. Biol. 1993; 50: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or a biotinylated anti-l-ficolin-monoclonal antibody (2F5) (38Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizuochi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2448-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) was added to the wells and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The wells were washed again and then incubated with an avidin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was developed with ABTS (azino-di-(3-methylbenzthiazoline) sulfonic acid, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The amount of the MBL/MASP complexes or l-ficolin/MASP complexes bound to plates was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm (A405). C4 Activation Assay—The activation of the lectin-complement pathway was determined by the C4 cleavage assay as described by Petersen et al. (39Petersen S.V. Thiel S. Jensen L. Steffensen R. Jensenius J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 257: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). PGN- and 1, 3-d-β-glucan-coupled microplates were blocked with Block-Ace, and the purified MBL/MASP or ficolin/MASP complexes (8 μg of protein/well) were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The wells were washed first with TBST and then with mannitol gelatin veronal buffer (5 mm veronal, 74 mm NaCl, 0.1% gelatin, 2.3% mannitol, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4)). Human C4 (0.3 μg) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The wells then were washed with TBST, and C4 deposition was detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-C4 antibody (horseradish peroxidase-anti-C4) at 37 °C for 1 h followed by development with ABTS. The amount of C4 deposition was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Isolation of Human MBL Using PGN-coupled Sepharose 4B—PGN-coupled Sepharose 4B columns and the control-Sepharose 4B columns were loaded with human serum precipitate. Upon elution with 0.3 m GlcNAc, no differences were observed in the elution profiles of proteins eluted from the two columns as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (data not shown). However, the elution of the PGN-Sepharose column with 0.3 m GlcNAc followed by 0.3 m mannose yielded a 30-kDa band (Fig. 1A, Band-a). Furthermore, the amino-terminal sequence and two partial amino acid sequences (M-1 and M-2) of Band-a were identical to the sequences of human MBL (Fig. 1B). Human IgG and IgM from the PGN column were removed through the use of the protein A and the anti-IgM column, which yielded a homogenate of MBL (Fig. 1C, lane 5). In all, ∼148 μg of human MBL was obtained when 100 ml of human plasma was loaded onto the PGN-coupled column. These results suggest that human MBL recognizes and binds to soluble PGN. Isolation of Human l-Ficolin Using 1,3-β-d-Glucan-coupled Toyopearl—Human serum precipitate was loaded on a 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled Toyopearl column. When the column was eluted with either 0.3 m glucose or 0.3 m mannose, IgG or IgM alone could be isolated (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–5 and 7–10, respectively). When 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled column was eluted with 0.3 m GlcNAc, a 35-kDa protein was isolated (Band-b, lanes 11–14). The amino-terminal sequence of Band-b was identical to that of human l-ficolin (Fig. 2B). The removal of human IgG and IgM as described above resulted in a homogenate of l-ficolin (Fig. 2C, lane 4). In all, ∼75 μg of l-ficolin was obtained when 100 ml of human plasma was loaded onto the 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled column. Further, l-ficolin did not bind to control-Toyopearl column (Fig. 2D), and MBL was present in the pass-though fraction of the 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled column (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that l-ficolin recognizes and binds to 1,3-β-d-glucan. Association of Purified MBL and l-Ficolin with MASPs—To determine whether MBL and l-ficolin associate with MASPs, eluents were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-MASP-1 and anti-MASP-2/sMAP antibodies. MASP-1, MASP-2, and sMAP were detected along with MBL in the pass-through fractions from the protein A column (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 1) and from the anti-IgM column (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 2) under non-reducing conditions and reducing conditions, respectively. Further, purified l-ficolin from the 1,3-β-d-glucan-column was associated with MASP-1, MASP-2, and sMAP (Fig. 3, C and D). Because human MASPs hydrolyze several chromogenic substrates (40Ambrus G. Gal P. Kojima M. Szilagyi K. Balczer J. Antal J. Graf L. Laich A. Moffatt B.E. Schwaeble W. Sim R.B. Zavodszky P. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1374-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the amidase activity of the purified MBL/MASP and l-ficolin/MASP complexes was assessed using t-butyloxycarbonyl-l-leucyl-l-seryl-l-threonyl-l-arginine 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan). Specific amidase activity was observed (data not shown), suggesting that the active forms of MASPs are co-purified with MBL and l-ficolin. These data suggest that purified MBL and l-ficolin are associated with MASP-1, MASP-2, and sMAP. Activation of the Lectin Pathway of Complement—To examine the complement activation capacity of the two purified lectins, we next examined whether the purified MBL/MASP complexes and l-ficolin/MASP complexes can bind to PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan, respectively. For this experiment, PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan were chemically coupled with carboxyl- and amino-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microplates, respectively. Purified l-ficolin/MASP complexes exhibited stronger binding to 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled microplates (Fig. 4A, second column) than to PGN-coupled plate (Fig. 4A, first column). In contrast, MBL/MASP complexes showed strong binding to PGN plates (Fig. 4B, first column) but did not bind significantly to 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled plates (Fig. 4B, second column). These results clearly support that the binding specificities of the MBL and l-ficolin against PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan, respectively, are consistent with the results of the column chromatographies. Previous studies demonstrate that MASP-2 cleaves C4 to C4a and C4b when its complexes with MBL and l-ficolin engage complementary carbohydrate ligands on the surface of microorganisms, leading to the covalent linking of C4b to such pathogens (C4 deposition) (39Petersen S.V. Thiel S. Jensen L. Steffensen R. Jensenius J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 257: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Using the fixed PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan plates, we measured the ability of cleaving C4 by the purified MBL and l-ficolin. C4 cleavage and subsequent C4b deposition occurred in PGN plates incubated with MBL/MASP (Fig. 5A, first column) or l-ficolin/MASP complexes (Fig. 5B, first column) as well as with 1,3-β-d-glucan plates incubated with l-ficolin/MASP complexes (Fig. 5C, first column). There was also a low level of C4 cleavage when PGN plates were incubated with l-ficolin/MASP complexes (Fig. 5B, first column), reflecting the weaker binding of l-ficolin/MASP complexes to PGN as demonstrated above. However, this did not occur in 1,3-β-d-glucan plates incubated with MBL/MASP complexes (Fig. 5D, first column). These results suggest that PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan may stimulate the lectin pathway of the complement via MBL/MASP and l-ficolin/MASP complexes, respectively. Recent studies have demonstrated that human MBL and l-ficolin constitute a group of soluble pattern recognition proteins that can stimulate the lectin pathway of the complement following binding to several ligands, such as mannan (41Ohta M. Okada M. Yamashina I. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1980-1984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lipoteichoic acid (42Lynch N.J. Roscher S. Hartung T. Morath S. Matsushita M.

Fujita T. Yokochi T. Takada H. Endo Y. Blood. 2002; 100: 3233-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and several pathogenic microbes including bacteria and fungi (44Neth O. Jack D.L. Dodds A.W. Holzel H. Klein N.J. Turner M.W. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). However, no biochemical data regarding specific interactions between soluble PGN or 1,3-β-d-glucan and MBL/MASP or l-ficolin/MASP complexes have been reported. In this result, we have shown that l-ficolin/MASP complexes bound to 1,3-β-d-glucan and MBL/MASP complexes bound to S. aureus PGN can induce the activation of complement protein C4. Our results provide biochemical evidence of the recent observation (45Neth O. Jack D.L. Johnson M. Klein N.J. Turner M.W. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4430-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) that MBL/MASP complexes binding to S. aureus cells enhanced complement activation and opsonophagocytosis. Two recent reports (42Lynch N.J. Roscher S. Hartung T. Morath S. Matsushita M. Maennel D.N. Kuraya M. Fujita T. Schwaeble W.J. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 43Zhao L. Ohtaki Y. Yamaguchi K. Matsushita M. Fujita T. Yokochi T. Takada H. Endo Y. Blood. 2002; 100: 3233-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) demonstrate that MBL/MASP complexes can bind to lipopolysaccharide and that l-ficolin/MASP complexes can bind to lipoteichoic acid, a cell component found in all Gram-positive bacteria. These interactions lead to C4 deposition, suggesting that lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid can activate the lectin pathway of the complement via MBL and l-ficolin, respectively. The diverse recognition abilities of human MBL and l-ficolin against different pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules and the co-existence of MBL and l-ficolin in serum are expected to enlarge the spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms that can be recognized and eliminated through the lectin pathway of the complement activation. Recent data support that the arthropod pro-PO system has similarity with the mammalian lectin pathway of the complement system (46Söderhäll K. Cerenius L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 47Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects.

Both the pro-PO activation system and the lectin pathway of the complement are proteolytic cascades comprising pattern recognition proteins, several serine proteases, and their inhibitors and terminate with the zymogen, pro-PO, and the membrane attack complex, respectively (49Walport M.J. New Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1058-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (2376) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, when we tried to purify 1,3-β-d-glucan recognition molecules from insect hemolymph, we obtained insect 1,3-β-d-glucan recognition protein and PGRPs-like proteins. These molecules triggered the activation of insect pro-PO system in association with an unidentified serine protease (17Lee M.H. Osaki T. Lee J.Y. Baek M.J. Zhang R. Park J.W. Kawabata S.I.

In this study, MBL and l-ficolin from human serum were shown to act as pattern recognition molecules for PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan. These molecules were also found to be associated with MASP and sMAP. Among them, MASP-2 could activate the C4 component of the complement. These data provide strong evidence for a highly conserved nature of innate immunity from insects to mammals. l-Ficolin is shown to have a carbohydrate binding specificity for GlcNAc (38Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizuochi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2448-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 50Matsushita M. Endo Y. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2281-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Because β-glucan has a backbone structure of β-1,3-linked glucoses, the reason why l-ficolin bound to 1.3-β-d-glucan and eluted with GlcNAc remains to be elucidated. In addition, l-ficolin can bind to the PGN column and also to the control-Sepharose (data not shown), indicating that l-ficolin is not a specific PGN recognition protein. Previously, Le et al. (51Le Y. Tan S.M. Lee S.H. Kon O.L. Lu J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 204: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reported that l-ficolin could bind to CNBr-activated Sepharose that had been inactivated with Tris and could be eluted from the preparation using GlcNAc. They also postulated that l-ficolin might recognize an amide group (-CO-NH-) or a similar group with an amide linkage of the control-Sepharose (52Le Y. Lee S.H. Kon O.L. Lu J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, in this study, a considerable amount of l-ficolin was bound to PGN. Because PGN is composed of sugar chains consisting of alternating GlcNAc and N-acetylmuramic acid, the possibility remains that l-ficolin bound specifically to PGN. This point still is to be clarified. In conclusion, this study shows that human MBL and l-ficolin specifically recognize soluble PGN and 1,3-β-d-glucan, respectively, and that subsequently these PGN- and 1,3-β-d-glucan-recognizing pattern proteins can induce C4 activation of the complement. In addition, PGN-coupled Sepharose or 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled Toyopearl may provide a step in an improved purification procedure for human MBL/MASP complexes or ficolin/MASP complexes to study their biological and functional studies.

https://openalex.org/W1991861950,"Previous studies indicate that Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), also known as intestinal-enriched Krüppel-like factor (IKLF), is a positive regulator of cell proliferation and gives rise to a transformed phenotype when overexpressed. Here we demonstrate that levels of KLF5 transcript and protein are significantly elevated in oncogenic H-Ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells. These cells display an accelerated rate of proliferation in both serum-containing and serum-deprived media and form anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar assays. H-Ras-transformed cells also contain elevated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. When treated with inhibitors of MEK (MAPK kinase), H-Ras-transformed cells lose their growth advantage and no longer form colonies. Significantly, levels of KLF5 transcript and protein are substantially reduced in H-Ras-transformed cells treated with MEK inhibitors. Moreover, inhibition of KLF5 expression in H-Ras-transformed cells with KLF5-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to a decreased rate of proliferation and a significant reduction in colony formation. H-Ras-transformed cells also contain elevated levels of Egr1 that are diminished by MEK inhibitors. Inhibition of Egr1 by siRNA results in a reduced level of KLF5, indicating that Egr1 mediates the inductive action of MAPK on KLF5. Lastly, KLF5 activates expression of cyclin D1. These findings indicate that the increased expression of KLF5 in H-Ras-transformed cells is secondary to increased MAPK activity from H-Ras overexpression and that the elevated level of KLF5 is in part responsible for the proproliferative and transforming activities of oncogenic H-Ras."

https://openalex.org/W2028640227,"We have studied the mechanism of mutant p53-mediated oncogenesis using several tumor-derived mutants. Using a colony formation assay, we found that the majority of the mutants increased the number of colonies formed compared to the vector. Expression of tumor-derived p53 mutants increases the rate of cell growth, suggesting that the p53 mutants have ‘gain of function’ properties. We have studied the gene expression profile of cells expressing tumor-derived p53-D281G to identify genes transactivated by mutant p53. We report the transactivation of two genes, asparagine synthetase and human telomerase reverse transcriptase. Quantitative real-time PCR confirms this upregulation. Transient transfection promoter assays verify that tumor-derived p53 mutants transactivate these promoters significantly. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay shows that tumor-derived p53-mutants cannot bind to the wild-type p53 consensus sequence. The results presented here provide some evidence of a possible mechanism for mutant p53-mediated transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1999095014,"We recently reported that cAMP suppresses apoptosis in colon cancer cells and induces cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2 (c-IAP2) via a cAMP-responsive element (CRE), suggesting a mechanism for chemoprevention of colon cancer by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, we used T84 human colon cancer cells to define the pathway by which increases in cAMP induce c-IAP2 expression. Treatment with several different cAMP agonists stimulated phosphorylation of CRE-binding protein (CREB) and activated expression of c-IAP2 in a CREB-dependent manner. Studies with pharmacological inhibitors revealed that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of CREB required activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK but was largely independent of protein kinase A. Immunoblots and transcriptional reporter assays using specific inhibitors, as well as expression of constitutively active forms of MEK1 and MKK3, showed that c-IAP2 induction by cAMP is regulated predominantly through ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK and suggested involvement of p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase and mitogen and stress response kinase-1 as well. Consistent with those results, we found that cAMP-dependent suppression of apoptosis was blocked by treatment with inhibitors of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. We conclude that cAMP can induce c-IAP2 expression in colon cancer cells through CREB phosphorylation and CRE-dependent transcription in a manner that involves activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. These results emphasize that activation of kinases other than protein kinase A can mediate the actions of agents that increase cAMP, particularly in the regulation of CREB-dependent events.

IAP family proteins have potentially important roles in the regulation of apoptosis and tumorigenesis (15Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C.

Although eight human IAPs have been identified (18Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar), c-IAP1/BIRC2 and c-IAP2/BIRC3 are the only IAPs that appear to be part of a signaling complex recruited to the cytoplasmic domain of the type 2 TNF receptor (19Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). In addition, c-IAP2 was also suggested to be a causative gene of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and to have a role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression (20Dierlamm J. Baens M. Wlodarska I. Stefanova-Ouzounova M. Hernandez J.M. Hossfeld D.K. De Wolf-Peeters C. Hagemeijer A. Van den Berghe H. Marynen P. Blood. 1999; 93: 3601-3609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active forms of caspase-3 and -7 are directly inhibited by c-IAP2 (19Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar), which can also prevent the proteolytic processing of procaspase-3, -6, and -7 by blocking the cytochrome c-induced activation of procaspase-9 (21Deveraux Q.L.

Expression of c-IAP2 is regulated through multiple regulatory elements in its promoter region. A NF-κB binding site is essential for induction by TNFα in Jurkat T cells (22Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A.

Dexamethasone induces c-IAP2 expression through a putative glucocorticoid response element in A549 human lung cancer cells (24Webster J.C. Huber R.M. Hanson R.L. Collier P.M. Haws T.F. Mills J.K.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3866-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), while a cAMP-responsive element (CRE) has an essential role in induction of c-IAP2 expression by cAMP in T84 colon cancer cells (12Nishihara H.

In this study, we analyzed the signal transduction pathways that mediate induction of c-IAP2 in response to increases in cAMP in T84 cells. We show that cAMP-promoted phosphorylation of CREB and transcriptional activation of c-IAP2 appear in large part to be mediated by activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, perhaps acting via p90RSK and MSK1.

Cell Culture—T84 human colon epithelial cells were cultured in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Immunoblot Analysis—For detection of phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-p38 MAPK, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For detection of other proteins, cells were lysed in 1× SDS sample buffer and sonicated twice for 15 s. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Specific binding was visualized by Super Signal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce) and quantified by using an EpiChemi II darkroom image analyzer (Ultraviolet Products). Dual Luciferase Assay—T84 cells in 24-well plates were transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) with pGL3-c-IAP2 (–1931 to +27) or pGL3-c-IAP2-CREII-Luc (–87 to +27), pRL-SV40-Luc (Promega, Madison, WI) carrying Renilla luciferase under the control of a constitutively active SV40 promoter as a transfection control, and CREB, MEK1, or MKK3 expression vectors as indicated in the figure legends. The dual luciferase assay was conducted with a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). PKA Activity Assay—Kinase activity of PKA was assayed with the PepTag® assay (Promega). Briefly T84 cells serum-starved for 6 h were treated for 1 h with H89 (10 μm) or (Rp)-cAMPS (100 μm) and stimulated with Fsk or 8-CPT-cAMP for 3 min. Cells were washed with phospate-buffered saline twice and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates containing 8 μg of total protein were incubated with 2 μg of PepTag A1 peptide in reaction buffer for 8 min. Phosphorylated peptide was separated by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and quantified by using an EpiChemi II darkroom image analyzer. ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK Kinase Assay—Kinase activities of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK were assayed with a p44/42 MAPK assay kit (non-radioactive) and p38 MAPK assay kit (non-radioactive) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.), respectively. Briefly T84 cells were preincubated with inhibitors for 1 h followed by incubation with 8-CPT-cAMP for 30 min. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were incubated with immobilized anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK or anti-phospho-p38 MAPK mAb for 4–12 h. Precipitated kinases were incubated with Elk or activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2) fusion protein for 30 min in kinase reaction buffer containing 200 μm ATP, and phosphorylation of fusion proteins was detected by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies. Rap1 Pull-down Assay—Cells were serum-starved overnight and incubated with inhibitors for 1 h followed by further stimulation as indicated in the figure legends.

Analysis of Apoptosis—T84 cells were incubated with inhibitors for 1 h followed by further incubation with CTX or 8-CPT-cAMP for 1 h. Cells were stimulated with staurosporine for 12 h and lysed in lysis buffer. After centrifugation of cells at 250 × g for 5 min, supernatants were isolated and assayed with the Cell Death Detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay PLUS kit (Roche Applied Science). Caspase-3 Assay—Caspase-3 activity was assayed with a colorimetric assay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Data Presentation and Analysis—Results are shown as mean ± S.E. of at least three experiments as indicated in the figure legends. Comparisons between experimental groups were by paired or unpaired t test as appropriate with p < 0.05 considered significant. cAMP Induces c-IAP2 Expression Predominantly through PKA-independent Pathways in T84 Colon Epithelial Cells—We have previously shown that increases in cellular cAMP levels can transcriptionally induce c-IAP2 expression in T84 cells (12Nishihara H. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Insel P.A. Eckmann L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8921-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To characterize the underlying mechanisms, we investigated the effects of multiple agents that raise cellular cAMP concentrations to regulate the activity of a full-length transcriptional reporter of c-IAP2. PGE2 binds to Gs-coupled EP2 and EP4 receptors on colon epithelial cells and increases intracellular cAMP concentration (26Bastien L. Sawyer N. Grygorczyk R. Metters K.M. Adam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11873-11877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Belley A. Chadee K. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 1352-1362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fsk directly stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity and increases cAMP production. We also used CTX, which catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation of Gs leading to the activation of adenylyl cyclase, and the membrane-permeant cAMP analog 8-CPT-cAMP. Stimulation of T84 cells with all four agonists that raise intracellular cAMP increased c-IAP2 promoter activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). To begin to define the downstream signaling mechanism for the cAMP-promoted increase in c-IAP2 promoter activity, we first focused on the role of PKA, the major effector kinase that mediates the action of cAMP. Surprisingly two different pharmacological inhibitors of PKA, H89 (10 μm) and (Rp)-cAMPS (100 μm), showed only limited inhibition (<25%) of cAMP-dependent increases in c-IAP2 promoter activity (Fig. 1B) and protein expression (Fig. 1C), although increases in PKA activity after Fsk and 8-CPT-cAMP stimulation were effectively inhibited by the same concentrations of these agents (Fig. 1D). These data suggested that cAMP-induced c-IAP2 expression is predominantly regulated by PKA-independent pathways in colon epithelial cells. Subsequent studies were designed to examine this possibility. cAMP Stimulates c-IAP2 Promoter Activity through Phosphorylation of CREB—Our previous data indicated that a CRE in the c-IAP2 promoter region is necessary for induction by cAMP (12Nishihara H. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Insel P.A. Eckmann L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8921-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that CREB may be a prominent factor in controlling cAMP-dependent c-IAP2 transcription. To test this idea directly, we performed co-transfections with a minimal c-IAP2 transcriptional reporter that contains the proximal CRE region and is fully responsive to cAMP stimulation (12Nishihara H. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Insel P.A. Eckmann L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8921-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and an expression vector encoding one of two dominant negative mutants of CREB, KCREB or CREB S133A. KCREB forms an inactive dimer with endogenous CREB and blocks its ability to bind to CRE (28Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar). CREB S133A contains a serine to alanine mutation at position 133 that blocks phosphorylation of the mutant CREB and thus its ability to initiate CRE-dependent transcription (29Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Both dominant negative forms of CREB abrogated increased c-IAP2 promoter activity induced by 8-CPT-cAMP (Fig. 2A) and CTX (data not shown), whereas co-transfection with wild-type CREB showed a slight, albeit not significant, increase in c-IAP2 promoter activity compared with vector-transfected control. Furthermore, consistent with its functional importance, endogenous CREB was phosphorylated in response to treatment of T84 cells with Fsk or 8-CPT-cAMP, whereas ATF-2 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, other transcriptional factors that bind to CRE, were only minimally phosphorylated under these conditions (Fig. 2B and data not shown). Together these data indicate that phosphorylated CREB plays an essential role for c-IAP2 gene transcription in response to increases in cAMP. CREB Phosphorylation Is Mediated by ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK—Phosphorylation of CREB is required for its transcriptional activation (30Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Although PKA is an important kinase for CREB phosphorylation, we found that in T84 cells the PKA inhibitors H89 and (Rp)-cAMPS only slightly suppressed its cAMP-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we hypothesized that in this system other kinases, such as p90RSK, a kinase downstream of ERK1/2 (31Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), and MSK1, a kinase downstream of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK (32Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), both of which can phosphorylate CREB (33Xing J. Kornhauser J.M. Xia Z. Thiele E.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1946-1955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), might participate in the phosphorylation of CREB in response to increases in cAMP. We found that both p90RSK and MSK1 were phosphorylated after stimulation with 8-CPT-cAMP (Fig. 3) and Fsk (data not shown). Phosphorylation of p90RSK promoted by 8-CPT-cAMP was inhibited by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (10 μm), while it was slightly, but not significantly, increased by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190. 8-CPT-cAMP-promoted phosphorylation of MSK1 was inhibited moderately by both U0126 and SB202190 and more strongly by the combination of these agents (Fig. 3). The PKA inhibitors (Rp)-cAMPS (Fig. 3) and H89 (data not shown) did not affect Fsk- or 8-CPT-cAMP-stimulated phosphorylation of p90RSK or MSK1. These results suggest that cAMP activates p90RSK through ERK1/2 and MSK1 through ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in T84 cells and that activation of these kinases occurs independently of PKA. Importantly CREB phosphorylation promoted by 8-CPT-cAMP (Fig. 3) or Fsk (data not shown) was significantly suppressed by U0126 or SB202190 alone, and this suppression was even more pronounced after addition of both inhibitors. Addition of (Rp)-cAMPS, which by itself only minimally decreased CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 2, B and 3, lane b), together with U0126 and SB202190 caused only modest and not significant further inhibition beyond that produced by the latter agents (Fig. 3, lanes e and f). Similar results were obtained by using other inhibitors for ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, i.e. PD98059 and SB203850, respectively (data not shown). These data suggest that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK are involved in the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of CREB. cAMP Activates ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in T84 Cells— Because the results in Fig. 3 suggested the involvement of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in the phosphorylation of p90RSK and MSK1, we directly examined the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in response to agents that raise cAMP levels. Treatment of T84 cells with PGE2, Fsk, or 8-CPT-cAMP enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK within 30 min as did TNFα as a positive control (Fig. 4A). Furthermore in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK after 8-CPT-cAMP stimulation was accompanied by activation of these kinases. Thus, activated-ERK1/2 or p38 MAPK immunoprecipitated from 8-CPT-cAMP-stimulated cell lysates showed an increased ability, relative to control cells, to phosphorylate their respective substrates, Elk or ATF-2 fusion proteins (Fig. 4, B and C). Increased ERK1/2 kinase activity was completely inhibited by treatment with U0126 but was insensitive to PKA inhibitors (Fig. 4B), documenting further that ERK1/2 activation is PKA-independent in T84 cells. In contrast, in CHO cells ERK1/2 activation by cAMP is a PKA-dependent event because H89 inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by 8-CPT-cAMP stimulation (Fig. 4E), a finding consistent with prior reports (34Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The PKA inhibitors also failed to inhibit the cAMP-dependent increase in p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that increases in cAMP activate both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in T84 cells, and these activations appear to occur independently of PKA. In addition to PKA, another recently recognized effector of cAMP action is Epac, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rap, which is able to regulate ERK1/2 activity in some cells (35Laroche-Joubert N. Marsy S. Michelet S. Imbert-Teboul M. Doucet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18598-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 36Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 258-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Because our results showed that cAMP-promoted ERK1/2 activation is a PKA-independent event, we examined the ability of 8-CPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, a specific activator of Epac that activates Rap1 in CHO, PC12, and human embryonic kidney 293T cells (34Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O. Blank J.L. Bos J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), to stimulate ERK1/2 activation in T84 cells. We found that 8-CPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP failed to activate ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in these cells (Fig. 4, D and E), although as a positive control, this analog was able to activate Rap1 (Fig. 4F), consistent with the conclusion that cAMP-promoted ERK1/2 activation in T84 cells occurs via an Epac-independent pathway. cAMP Induces c-IAP2 Expression through the Activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK—We next examined the involvement of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in cAMP-dependent transcriptional activation of the c-IAP2 gene. Stimulation of c-IAP2 promoter activity by CTX and 8-CPT-cAMP (see Fig. 1A) was significantly diminished by adding the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190, and this inhibition was even greater by combined treatment with both inhibitors (Fig. 5A). Consistent with this, increased c-IAP2 protein expression after stimulation with CTX and 8-CPT-cAMP was also markedly inhibited by the combination of inhibitors of MEK1/2 and p38 MAPK (Fig. 5B). Addition of (Rp)-cAMPS yielded no significant further inhibition of c-IAP2 expression, providing additional support for the conclusion that PKA has a limited, if any, role in mediating cAMP-dependent c-IAP2 induction. As an alternative approach to defining the role of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in the regulation of c-IAP2 expression, we performed co-transfections with a c-IAP2 promoter-reporter and expression vectors for dominant active forms of MEK1 and/or MKK3, which are potent activators of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, respectively (25Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 37Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). Forced expression of active forms of MEK1 or MKK3 induced c-IAP2 promoter activity, which was further enhanced by co-transfection with both expression plasmids (Fig. 5C). Based on these data, we conclude that ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK play a pivotal role in the cAMP-promoted induction of c-IAP2 via increased phosphorylation of CREB. cAMP Regulates Apoptosis in Colon Epithelial Cells through ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK—To assess the biological significance of the involvement of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in the c-IAP2 induction stimulated by cAMP, we assayed T84 cells for apoptosis. Treatment of T84 cells with CTX or 8-CPT-cAMP inhibited apoptosis induced by staurosporine as assessed by quantitative analysis of DNA fragmentation. This inhibition was abrogated by adding a combination of inhibitors of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK (Fig. 6A). When we examined these inhibitors individually, U0126 and SB202190 as well as H89 but not (Rp)-cAMPS, each significantly blunted the 8-CPT-cAMP-promoted inhibition of staurosporine-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6B). The difference between the responses to H89 and (Rp)-cAMPS might relate to the ability of H89 to inhibit not only PKA but also MSK1 (38Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3910) Google Scholar). U0126 and SB202190 also blocked the inhibition of caspase-3 activity produced by CTX or 8-CPT-cAMP treatment of T84 cells (Fig. 6C); this effect was not further enhanced by addition of (Rp)-cAMPS. These results are consistent with the action of c-IAP2 in binding to the active form of caspase-3 and thereby diminishing its activity (15Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar) and with results of experiments shown above for the role of kinases other than PKA in regulation of c-IAP2 expression. Fig. 7 shows a model that summarizes these pathways.Fig. 7Model of cAMP-mediated c-IAP2 induction. PGE2-, CTX-, and Fsk-stimulated increases in cAMP activate PKA, ERK1/2, and p38 MAPK followed by p90RSK and MSK1 activation. The actions of cAMP on ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation are likely to be indirect as indicated in the figure with two arrows. CREB, phosphorylated in response to activation of p90RSK and MSK1, and to a lesser degree PKA, then induces c-IAP2 expression through CRE within the proximal c-IAP2 promoter region. c-IAP2 protein inhibits activated caspase-3 and apoptosis. AC, adenylyl cyclase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Apoptosis is a complex cellular process that is regulated by a balance of stimulatory and inhibitory pathways. The ability of cAMP to inhibit apoptosis might result from a blockade of proapoptotic pathways, a stimulation of antiapoptotic pathways, or a combination thereof. While some of the proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as BAD, have been reported to be phosphorylated and inactivated by PKA, thereby resulting in inhibition of apoptosis (40Harada H.

Cell. 2000; 6: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), we recently identified an alternative mechanism for cAMP-mediated antiapoptosis: an inhibition of apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells by agonists that increase cAMP and induce c-IAP2 via a CRE in the c-IAP2 promoter (12Nishihara H. Kizaka-Kondoh S. Insel P.A. Eckmann L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8921-8926Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We showed that c-IAP2 induction by increases in cAMP levels inhibits apoptosis that occurs in response to anti-Fas antibody (extrinsic apoptotic pathway) or staurosporine (intrinsic apoptotic pathway). The results thus suggested a novel mechanism for the cancer-chemopreventive effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit cyclooxygenases and decrease PGE2 synthesis (12Nishihara H.

In the current studies, we have identified new aspects of the signal transduction pathway by which increases in cAMP induce c-IAP2 expression in colon cancer cells (Fig. 7). The data show that CREB phosphorylation is a key step but that the phosphorylation appears to occur by kinases other than the expected involvement of PKA. Activation of p90RSK and MSK1, which follow ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation, appears to be involved in both CREB phosphorylation and c-IAP2 induction. The current data also suggest that agents that raise intracellular cAMP and induce c-IAP2 expression in T84 cells do not appear to act via ATF-2 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, other transcriptional factors that bind to CRE, because we found minimal phosphorylation of ATF-2 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein after cAMP treatment. Conventional ideas emphasize that cAMP-mediated transcriptional responses involve the ability of PKA to phosphorylate CREB (30Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). However, the data shown here provide evidence for an alternative mechanism whereby cAMP promotes phosphorylation of CREB through ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK and perhaps other protein kinases as well. Previous data have implicated a role for p90RSK in the phosphorylation of CREB promoted by certain growth factors (44Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 45Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Several of our results imply a limited involvement of PKA: 1) two different PKA inhibitors (H89 and (Rp)-cAMPS) used at concentrations that block PKA activity yielded only minimal inhibition of CREB phosphorylation, c-IAP2 promoter activity, and c-IAP2 protein levels, and 2) addition of (Rp)-cAMPS along with inhibitors of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK did not cause greater inhibition of cAMP-induced c-IAP2 induction or abrogation of inhibition of apoptosis or caspase activation by cAMP despite inhibition of PKA activity. Thus, the current results emphasize a role for ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in cAMP-mediated induction of c-IAP2. However, because H89 and (Rp)-cAMPS had some ability to decrease cAMP-promoted CREB phosphorylation and c-IAP2 promoter activity, PKA might contribute in a limited way to CRE-dependent transcription through CREB phosphorylation. cAMP is involved in multiple cellular processes that are thought to be mediated by PKA and Epac (46Kopperud R. Krakstad C. Selheim F. Doskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Increases in cAMP activate ERK1/2 through PKA in CHO, PC12, and human embryonic kidney 293T cells (34Enserink J.M. Christensen A.E. de Rooij J. van Triest M. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Doskeland S.O.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37242-37249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover an increase in cAMP levels promoted by thyroid-stimulating hormone stimulation activates p38 MAPK through PKA in thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor-overexpressing CHO cells (48Pomerance M. Abdullah H.B. Kamerji S. Correze C. Blondeau J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40539-40546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), while cAMP activates p38 MAPK in a PKA-independent manner in Th2 effector T cells (49Chen C.H. Zhang D.H. LaPorte J.M. Ray A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5597-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Here we show that increases in cAMP induce ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation in colon epithelial cells through PKA- and Epac-independent pathways, suggesting involvement of alternative mechanisms of MAPK activation. MAPKs regulate cellular activities ranging from gene expression, mitosis, motility, and metabolism to apoptosis. The ability of ERK1/2 to regulate cell proliferation has led to the exploration of inhibitors of ERK1/2 as possible anticancer agents (50Sebolt-Leopold J.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6594-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 51Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar). The potential role of p38 MAPK in cancer chemotherapy has also been considered, although p38 MAPK inhibitors have primarily been tested for inflammatory disorders (52Fan M. Chambers T.C. Drug Resist. Updat. 2001; 4: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 53English J.M. Cobb M.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 40-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In fact, inhibition of p38 MAPK promotes cell death of UV radiation-treated melanoma cells (54Ivanov V.N. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3003-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and TNFα-treated myelomonocytic cells (55Varghese J. Chattopadhaya S. Sarin A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6570-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our results emphasize the function of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in inhibition of apoptosis through c-IAP2 induction and suggest a mechanism that may contribute to actions of those kinases in cell death. CREB has been reported to regulate a number of target genes related to tumorigenesis and to cell survival (56Riccio A. Ahn S. Davenport C.M. Blendy J.A. Ginty D.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2358-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 57Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar), including cyclin D1 or BRCA1 (30Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Our findings emphasize the biological significance of CREB phosphorylation as a key event in the induction of c-IAP2 via multiple protein kinases in addition to PKA. The data also suggest that kinase inhibitors, other than inhibitors of PKA, might be able to blunt cAMP-promoted antiapoptosis. As an alternative approach, one might consider a CRE decoy system in which a decoy oligodeoxynucleotide carrying a CRE can be used to inhibit CRE-directed gene transcription and tumor growth without affecting normal cell growth (39Cho Y.S. Kim M.K. Cheadle C. Neary C. Park Y.G. Becker K.G. Cho-Chung Y.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15626-15631Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2061018077,"Thioredoxin-2 (Trx2) is a mitochondrial protein-disulfide oxidoreductase essential for control of cell survival during mammalian embryonic development. This suggests that mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase-2 (TrxR2), responsible for reducing oxidized Trx2, may also be a key player in the regulation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. With this in mind, we investigated the effects of overexpression of TrxR2, Trx2, or both on mammalian cell responses to various apoptotic inducers. Stable transfectants of mouse Neuro2A cells were generated that overexpressed TrxR2 or an EGFP-TrxR2 fusion protein. EGFP-TrxR2 was enzymatically active and was localized in mitochondria. TrxR2 protein level and TrxR activity could be increased up to 6-fold in mitochondria. TrxR2 and EGFP-TrxR2 transfectants showed reduced growth rates as compared with control cells. This growth alteration was not due to cytotoxic effects nor related to changes in basal mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), reactive oxygen species production, or to other mitochondrial antioxidant components such as Trx2, peroxyredoxin-3, MnSOD, GPx1, and glutathione whose levels were not affected by increased TrxR2 activity. In response to various apoptotic inducers, the extent of ΔΨm dissipation, reactive oxygen species induction, caspase activation, and loss of viability were remarkably similar in TrxR2 and control transfectants. Excess TrxR2 did not prevent trichostatin A-mediated neuronal differentiation of Neuro2A cells nor did it protect them against β-amyloid neurotoxicity. Neither massive glutathione depletion nor co-transfection of Trx2 and TrxR2 in Neuro2A (mouse), COS-7 (monkey), or HeLa (human) cells revealed any differential cellular resistance to prooxidant or non-oxidant apoptotic stimuli. Our results suggest that neither Trx2 nor TrxR2 gain of function modified the redox regulation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in these mammalian cells.

A drastic alteration of the mitochondrial redox environment, which includes rapid oxidation of NAD(P)H and glutathione, is one of the earliest events of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (1Nieminen A.L.

This phenomenon is associated with dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm) and subsequent induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocator; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; DHR123, dihydrorhodamine 123; DiOC6, 3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; EtBr, ethidium bromide; etdh-1, ethidium homodimer-1; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; HE, dihydroethidine; MMP, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization; MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; MTS, mitochondrial targeting sequence; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙−, superoxide; Prdx, peroxiredoxin; SeCys, selenocysteine; t-BHP, tert-butylhydroperoxide; TMRE, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester; Trx, thioredoxin; Trx2, mitochondrial thioredoxin; TrxR2, mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase-2; VP16, etoposide; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. generation (4Zamzami N.

Onset of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP), a decisive step in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, is regulated by both pyridine nucleotide (NAD/NADH and NADP+/NADPH) and glutathione (GSSG/GSH) redox equilibrium (5Chernyak B.V. Bernardi P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 6Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol.

Protein thiol (sulfhydryl) groups can be oxidized directly or indirectly by ROS, i.e. via GSH oxidation and mixed disulfide formation, such as glutathiolation. For example, specific thiol groups on the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), an inner membrane constituent of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex, have been implicated in modulating MMP. Oxidation of Cys-56 and crosslinking of Cys-56 to Cys-159 were shown to convert the ADP/ATP translocase into an opened nonspecific pore, a process causing MMP (7Costantini P. Belzacq A.S. Vieira H.L.

Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). More recently, ANT was also shown to be a critical target of apoptosis induction by nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, and 4-hydroxynonenal (10Vieira H.L. Belzacq A.S. Haouzi D. Bernassola F. Cohen I.

The cascade of events leading to MMP includes rapid NAD(P)H oxidation/depletion and tightly linked dissipation of ΔΨm, decreased oxidative phosphorylation, enhanced generation of superoxide, and mitochondrial osmotic swelling (4Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Petit P.X. Mignotte B. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar, 11Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2194) Google Scholar). The consequent rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane culminates with the release of soluble intermembrane death effector proteins including the caspase-9 activator cytochrome c (12Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), apoptosis-inducing factor (13Joza N. Susin S.A. Daugas E. Stanford W.L. Cho S.K. Li C.Y. Sasaki T. Elia A.J. Cheng H.Y.

MMP can be the rate-limiting step of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, regulated by the redox status of critical thiol groups in ANT and by interaction of the permeability transition pore complex with several factors including adenine nucleotides, Ca2+, and both anti-apoptotic and proapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins (reviewed in Refs. 8Vieira H.L.

Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial redox environment depends on both total cellular redox environment and compartmentalized mitochondrial reduction capacity (16Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3655) Google Scholar). This reduction capacity depends on the concentration of electron donor molecules such as NADPH, NADH, and glutathione (GSH) acting as antioxidant buffers, ROS detoxification enzymes, and protein-disulfide reductases. In mammalian mitochondria, ROS detoxification is achieved by successive conversion of ⋅NO and superoxide (O2˙− into H2O2 (and O2) by manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and peroxide reduction by glutathione peroxidases (GPx1 and GPx4) and potentially by the mitochondrial thioredoxin cycle system. Because of its elevated intracellular concentration (1–10 mm), GSH is largely responsible for low redox potential and free thiol level inside cells and organelles (16Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3655) Google Scholar, 17Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar). Experimentally induced glutathione deficiency in newborn rats has been shown to result in striking enlargement and degeneration of mitochondria (18Jain A. Martensson J. Stole E. Auld P.A. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1913-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). A second antioxidant defense, the mitochondrial thioredoxin system, which includes Trx2, thioredoxin reductase-2, and NADPH (see below), is a potential source of disulfide reductase activity required for maintaining mitochondrial proteins in their reduced state; thioredoxins catalyze reduction of protein disulfides at much higher rates than GSH (19Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6102-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). An additional mitochondrial thiol/disulfide oxidoreductase, glutaredoxin-2 (Grx2), was recently discovered, which relies on GSH and not Trx as electron donor (21Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J.

Little is known on the function(s) of the mitochondrial thioredoxin system and its potential role in the regulation of cell survival. Recent studies suggest that the mitochondrial Trx system is essential for mammalian development because disruption of the Trx2 gene in the mouse confers a lethal embryonic phenotype associated with massive apoptosis during early embryogenesis (23Nonn L. Williams R.R. Erickson R.P. Powis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 916-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Chicken cells (DT40) conditionally deficient for Trx2 expression have been reported to undergo apoptosis in the absence of exogenous stress (24Tanaka T. Hosoi F. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Ueda S. Nishiyama A. Takeda S. Wada H. Spyrou G. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In addition, glutathione depletion, serum withdrawal, and exposure to the prooxidant mitochondrial toxin, antimycin A, were all shown to enhance apoptosis in Trx2-deficient DT40 cells (24Tanaka T. Hosoi F. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Nakamura H. Masutani H. Ueda S. Nishiyama A. Takeda S. Wada H. Spyrou G. Yodoi J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 25Tanaka T.

On the other hand, overexpression of Trx2 was reported to enhance basal ΔΨm and protect human HEK-293 Trx2-transfected cells against etoposide-mediated cytotoxicity. In contrast, these cells were not protected against antimycin A cytotoxicity and turned out to be more sensitive than control cells to rotenone, another prooxidant mitochondrial toxin (26Damdimopoulos A.E.

Another study reported that Trx2 overexpression conferred increased oxidoresistance to human osteosarcoma cells exposed to tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP) (26Damdimopoulos A.E. Miranda-Vizuete A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 33242-33248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, the effects of Trx2 overexpression appear to be complex and to depend on unidentified variables including the possibility that endogenous Trx2 may not be a limiting factor in some experimental systems. Peroxiredoxins (Prdx) form a new family of thiol-specific peroxidases that rely on Trx as the hydrogen donor for the reduction of H2O2 and lipid hydroperoxides (28Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two mitochondrial Prdx isoforms have been identified so far. Prdx3, originally cloned from murine erythroleukemia cells (30Yamamoto T. Matsui Y. Natori S. Obinata M. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 80: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), is exclusively detected in mitochondria (31Watabe S. Hiroi T. Yamamoto Y. Fujioka Y. Hasegawa H. Yago N. Takahashi S.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Prdx3 expression can be induced in response to oxidant treatments, and antisense-mediated inhibition of Prdx3 expression was shown to sensitize bovine aortic endothelial cells to oxidative challenges (32Araki M. Nanri H. Ejima K. Murasato Y. Fujiwara T. Nakashima Y. Ikeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2271-2278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Prdx3 was identified as a target gene of nuclear c-Myc and shown to be essential for maintaining mitochondrial mass and transmembrane potential in transformed rat and human cells (33Wonsey D.R. Zeller K.I. Dang C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6649-6654Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of Prdx3 was found to inhibit apoptosis induced by oxidative insults in various cancer cell lines (34Nonn L. Berggren M. Powis G. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 682-689PubMed Google Scholar). Prdx5 is a second peroxiredoxin isoform that is located in the mitochondria when expressed as a long form, whereas a short form was found associated with peroxisomes (35Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20346-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Recently, Prdx5 overexpression was reported to be protective against ibotenate-mediated excitotoxicity (36Plaisant F. Clippe A. Vander Stricht D. Knoops B. Gressens P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 862-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Mammalian TrxR isoforms are flavin homodimeric oxidoreductases with an essential redox-active cysteine-selenocysteine (SeCys) conserved in their C-terminal part, which use NADPH to reduce the redox-active disulfide in oxidized Trx (37Zhong L. Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5854-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 38Mustacich D. Powis G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). These enzymes can also reduce a variety of nondisulfide substrates including selenite and peroxides. The broad substrate specificity of TrxR appears to be restricted to the mammalian isoforms because yeast and bacterial TrxR isoenzymes can only reduce Trx (39Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). A mitochondrial TrxR isoform, TrxR2, has been cloned from various mammals including mouse, cow, rat, and human (40Gasdaska P.Y. Gasdaska J.R. Cochran S. Powis G.

The specific co-localization of TrxR2, Trx2, and Prdx3 in mitochondria, presumed to function together, may suggest a defense system against H2O2 produced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain (45Lee S.R.

However, the relative contribution of this system to peroxide detoxification, as compared with the role of the GSH system, is not known. With regard to apoptosis, it was proposed that the mitochondrial thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system can play a role in redox regulation of the mitochondrial membrane permeability (46Wudarczyk J. Debska G. Lenartowicz E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 47Rigobello M.P. Callegaro M.T. Barzon E. Benetti M. Bindoli A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In support of this suggestion, auranofin, a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial TrxR, was reported to induce MMP and loss of ΔΨ in isolated mitochondria, two alterations that were completely inhibited by cyclosporin A, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition (48Rigobello M.P. Scutari G. Boscolo R. Bindoli A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Here we report the effect of transfection-mediated overexpression of TrxR2 or EGFP-tagged TrxR2 on mouse Neuro2A cell growth, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, ROS production, and viability, in response to a variety of prooxidant and non-oxidant inducers of apoptosis. Cell Culture and Reagents—Mouse Neuro2A (N2A), African green monkey COS-7, and human HeLa cell lines were purchased from ATCC. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 0.1 μm sodium selenite. The fluorescent probes 3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6), dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR123), dihydroethidine (HE), and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Unless specified otherwise, all reagents were from Sigma. Construction of Trx2, TrxR2, Mito-EGFP, and Mito-EGFP-TrxR2 Expression Plasmids—Total RNA was extracted from mouse liver using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). Full-length Trx2 and TrxR2 cDNAs were generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR with oligo(dT) using the RET-ROscript kit (Ambion). TrxR2 and Trx2 cDNAs were amplified by PCR with Pfu turbo polymerase using primers 83/84 and 143/144, respectively (Table I). PCR products were then isolated from agarose gels with the Qiagen gel extraction kit and subcloned in the pCR®-Blunt II-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen) before cloning into the EcoRI site of plasmid pCAGGS, i.e. downstream of a cytomegalovirus enhancer/actin promoter (49Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4597) Google Scholar), to generate pCAGGS-TrxR2 or pCAGGS-Trx2. For the construction of mito-EGFP, EGFP and the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) of TrxR2 were amplified separately, MTS from pCAGGS-TrxR2 with primers 83/216 and EGFP from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) with primers 217/219 including a stop codon. The amplified MTS and EGFP DNAs were digested with NheI, ligated together, and digested by EcoRI. Following separation of ligation products in agarose gels, DNA was isolated from the band of correct size (0.87 kb) and inserted in the EcoRI site of pCAGGS. For the construction of mito-EGFP-TrxR2, MTS was amplified from pCAGGS-TrxR2 with primers 83/216, EGFP from pEGFP-N1 with primers 217/218, and TrxR2 excluding MTS from pCAGGS-TrxR2 with primers 215/84. Amplified MTS and EGFP were digested by NheI; EGFP and TrxR2 DNA products were digested by SacI, and the three DNA preparations were mixed together for ligation. Following separation of ligation products in agarose gels, DNA was isolated from the band of correct size (2.6 kb) and inserted in the EcoRI site of pCAGGS. Recombinant plasmids with the required correct insert orientation were identified by restriction enzyme digestion. This was confirmed by DNA sequencing of whole recombinant DNAs inserted in pCAGGS.Table IPCR primers used for cloning and construction of chimeric gene recombinants Nucleotide sequences not complementary to genomic DNA are shown in lowercase letters.

Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 33-36Google Scholar) using increasing ratios of pCAGGS constructs to pINDsp1-Hygro plasmid (for selection with hygromycin-B, Invitrogen). The basal amount of pINDsp1-Hygro was always 1 μg per 100-mm culture dish (Sarstedt). Stable transfectant populations were generated with the following pCAGGS constructs using pCAGGS/pINDsp1-Hygro μg DNA ratios as indicated in parentheses: CtrlH63, pCAGGS (30/1); TrxR2H56, pCAGGS-TrxR2 (10/1); TrxR2H64, pCAGGS-TrxR2 (30/1); Trx2H161, pCAGGS-Trx2 (30/1); Trx2/TrxR2H162, pCAGGS-Trx2 (30/1) and pCAGGS-TrxR2 (30/1); TrxR2H163, pCAGGS-TrxR2 (60/1); mito-EGFPH143, pCAGGS-mito-EGFP (30/1); and EGFP-TrxR2H144, pCAGGS-EGFP-TrxR2 (30/1). Selection for hygromycin-B (500 μg/ml)-resistant cells started 48 h post-transfection for at least 2 weeks. Resistant colonies from each transfection were pooled to produce a heterogeneous population of transfected cells. The clone TrxR2c169 derives from one colony isolated from a pCAGGS-TrxR2 transfectant population. FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used for transient transfections according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. In brief, a ratio of 3/1 for FuGENE reagent (μl)/plasmid (μg) was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in incomplete medium before addition to 50% subconfluent cells in complete medium for 24 h. Cell Fractionation—Cell fractionation was carried out by differential centrifugation mainly as described previously (51Jana N.R. Zemskov E.A. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In brief, cells (2–4 × 107) were lysed with 60 Dounce strokes with a tight fitting pestle in buffered sucrose (BS): 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, and a tablet/10 ml of complete mix protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After two centrifugations at 1,000 × g to discard nuclei, mitochondria were pelleted at 10,000 × g, washed once, and resuspended in BS before storage at –80 °C. The cytosolic fraction was obtained by centrifugation of the post-mitochondrial supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Protein contents were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—Polyclonal antibodies against mouse Trx2, Prdx3, and TrxR2 were produced by injecting rabbits with hemocyanin-conjugated peptides, CLEAFLKKLIG for Trx2, CSPTASKEYFEKVHQ for Prdx3, and KRSGLEPTVTGCCG for TrxR2, respectively. The peptides were injected in complete Freund's adjuvant for the first immunization and with incomplete adjuvant 6 weeks later for three immunization boosts administered every 3 weeks. Affinity-purified GPx1 antibody was prepared from a rabbit antiserum produced by repeated immunization with recombinant human GPx1 expressed in bacteria (52Mirault M.E. Tremblay A. Beaudoin N. Tremblay M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20752-20760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with three boosts at 2-week intervals followed by three boosts at 1-month intervals using bovine GPx protein (Sigma G-6137). The antibody was purified by affinity for bovine GPx isolated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. All antibodies were stored at –20 °C after addition of 50% glycerol. SDS-PAGE (10%) was performed with equal amounts of protein (10 μg per track) separated in mini gels (Mini-Protean II, Bio-Rad) and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were saturated with TBS, 0.1% Tween 5% before incubation with antibody. The antibodies were used at the following dilutions: 1/5,000 for TrxR2, Trx2 (second boost), and Cox IV (Molecular Probes A-6431); 1/20,000 for Prdx3 (second boost) and β-actin (Sigma A5441); 1/10,000 for MnSOD (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 06-984); and 1/500 for purified GPx1 antibody. Antibody incubations were done at room temperature for 2–3 h in TBS, 0.1% Tween + 1% skim milk powder, except for MnSOD and GPx1, which were incubated overnight at 4 °C and 2 h at 37 °C, respectively, and without milk for GPx1 antibody. Enzyme Assays—TrxR and Trx activities were measured using the insulin reduction assay as described previously (39Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cytosolic or sonicated (30 s) total extract or mitochondrial fractions (25 μg of protein) in BS buffer (30 μl) were added to 20 μl of enzymatic assay mixture to the final concentrations as follows: 85 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.68 mm NADPH, 5 μm human Trx (Sigma), and 2.14 mg/ml insulin in a 96-well microplates. The 50-μl reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 200 μl of 6 m guanidine HCl in 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, containing 0.4 mg/ml 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic) acid. After 10 min at room temperature, the absorbance was read at 405 nm, and TrxR specific activity was calculated from the relation: units/g = A/20 min/27.2/g protein. Backgrounds from reactions without Trx reflecting the contribution of endogenous sulfhydryl groups in the extracts were subtracted. Trx activity was determined in the insulin reduction assay as described above except that bovine TrxR (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) was used instead of human Trx.

https://openalex.org/W2047475338,"The interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are important downstream signaling components of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). To date, four mammalian IRAKs have been found, namely IRAK-1, IRAK-2, IRAK-4, and IRAK-M. Herein, we show a detailed analysis of the genomic region encompassing the murine Irak2 gene and the molecular cloning of four isoforms of Irak2 (designated Irak2a, Irak2b, Irak2c, and Irak2d) generated by alternative splicing at the 5′-end of the gene. This alternative splicing has direct effects on the expression of the N-terminal death domain and/or inter-domain. No evidence of similar alternative splicing was found for the human IRAK2 gene. When overexpressed, Irak2a and Irak2b potentiated NF-κB activation by lipopolysaccharide. Importantly, Irak2c and Irak2d were inhibitory. The promoter for Irak2c differed from that of the other Irak2 isoforms in that it contained putative NF-κB binding sites. Lipopolysaccharide induced the expression of Irak2c, indicating a possible negative feedback effect on the signaling pathway. Alternative splicing of the Irak2 gene in mice will therefore generate agonistic or antagonistic Irak2 isoforms, which is likely to have consequences for the regulation of TLR signaling. These observations identify another distinguishing feature between mice and humans in the TLR system that is likely to be due to differences in the selective pressure imposed by pathogens on each species during evolution.

These observations identify another distinguishing feature between mice and humans in the TLR system that is likely to be due to differences in the selective pressure imposed by pathogens on each species during evolution. The Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; aa, amino acid(s); DD, death domain; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; nt, nucleotide(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcriptase; UTR, untranslated region. are a family of molecules tailored to respond to microbial pathogens, with particular TLRs able to recognize and bind to specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Once activated, TLRs recruit cytoplasmic adapter molecules such as myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), MyD88 adaptor-like protein (Mal; also known as TIRAP), TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon-β (TRIF; also termed TICAM-1), and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM; also termed TIRP or TICAM-2), which, in turn, initiate signaling cascades that result in biological responses geared toward the elimination of pathogens during infection (reviewed in Refs. 1Dunne A. O'Neill L. Science's STKE. 2003; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2003/171/re3)PubMed Google Scholar and 2O'Neill L. Fitzgerald K. Bowie A. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Critical to the TLR signaling cascade are the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs). The first human IRAK to be cloned was IRAK1 (3Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), followed by IRAK2 (4Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), IRAK-M (5Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and IRAK4 (6Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The IRAKs share sequence homology to the Drosophila melanogaster protein kinase Pelle, and all contain a death domain (DD), which is used for protein-protein interactions with the DDs of other molecules. For example, IRAK2 uses its DD to mediate its interaction with MyD88 (4Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The IRAKs also have putative kinase domains, although IRAK1 has dispensable kinase activity because interleukin-1-induced NF-κB activation could still be driven by a kinase-inactive mutant (7Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition, both IRAK2 and IRAK-M are catalytically inactive due to the absence of certain key residues within their putative kinase domains (4Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 5Wesche H. Gao X. Li X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Adding further complexity to the signaling cascades initiated by the TLRs are the recent findings that some of the genes encoding components of TLR signaling are alternatively spliced, thus generating multiple isoforms. One example is the murine MyD88 gene, which encodes a full-length MyD88 (MyD88L) and a shorter form (MyD88S) generated by the splicing out of exon 3; the removal of this exon causes the deletion in the mature polypeptide of the intermediate domain (8Janssens S. Burns K. Tschopp J. Beyaert R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 467-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Both forms of MyD88 are differentially expressed and exhibit differences in their ability to induce NF-κB activation and IRAK phosphorylation, with MyD88S being inhibitory (8Janssens S. Burns K. Tschopp J. Beyaert R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 467-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). MyD88S can, however, mediate the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (9Janssens S. Burns K. Vercammen E. Tschopp J. Beya FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Another example is the human IRAK1 gene, which encodes two isoforms generated by the differential usage of a splice acceptor site within exon 12 (10Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29037-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast to the full-length isoform (designated IRAK1a), the slightly shorter isoform (IRAK1b) is kinase-inactive and displays no change in its protein levels following interleukin-1 stimulation (10Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29037-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, we report the identification and annotation of the murine Irak2 gene, which generates four alternatively spliced isoforms of Irak2 that contain various deletions of the N-terminal third of the mature protein. Of these, Irak2a and Irak2b enhance the activity of an NF-κB reporter, whereas Irak2c and Irak2d are inhibitory. Our results therefore reveal a level of control of TLR signaling that involves differential splicing of murine Irak2. Sequence Analysis—The complete nucleotide sequence of the murine Irak2 gene and flanking regions was obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) mouse genomic data base (contig NT_039353 found at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), following BLAST analysis with the human IRAK2 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF026273). Other sequences used in this manuscript that were also obtained from the GenBank™ were the human IRAK2 genomic locus (contig NT_005927) and Irak2 cDNA (accession number AJ440756).

The identification of transcribed nucleotide sequences and repeat sequences in the genomic sequence was performed using the NIX application (hgmp.mrc.ac.uk). The translation of putative open reading frames was carried out using MacVector version 7.1 Oxford Molecular Ltd, and amino acid alignments were performed using ClustalW 1.8 (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu).

PCRs were amplified as described previously (17Hardy M.P. Hertzog P.J. Owczarek C.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 355-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli serotype O26:B6 was obtained from Sigma and used at 1 μg/ml. The pRL-TK vector was obtained from Promega, and the pCDNA3.0 vector was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) The pGL3-NF-κB construct bearing five repeats of the κB-consensus was a gift from Dr. R. Hofmeister (Universitaet Regensburg, Regensburg Germany). The human pCDNA-IRAK2 construct was obtained from Dr. Marta Muzio (Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy). Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total RNA was extracted from 5 × 106 RAW264.7 cells treated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 h using TRI REAGENT™ according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma). To each 10-cm2 dish of LPS-treated cells was added 1 ml of TRI-REAGENT™, and the homogenous lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Each supernatant was added to 0.2 ml of chloroform and incubated at room temperature for 15 min following vigorous mixing. The RNA phase was then separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, added to 0.5 ml of isopropanol, mixed, allowed to stand for 10 min then further centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The RNA pellets were then washed with 1 ml of 70% ethanol and resuspended in 50 μl of H2O. cDNA was generated from total RNA using Superscript™ III reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). To 9 μl of H2O was added 1 μl 50 μm oligo(dT)20 (Promega), 1 μg of total RNA, 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP, and the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 5 min and then on ice for a further 5 min. To this mixture was then added 4 μl of 5× first-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 1 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol (Invitrogen), 1 μl of RNase inhibitor (1 unit/μl; Promega), and 1 μl of 200 units/μl Superscript™ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for plus RT libraries or 1 μl of H2O for minus RT libraries; the final mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 60 min and then inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min. RT-PCR from RACE-ready cDNA libraries was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 2400 thermocycler in a reaction involving 2.5 μl 10× Vent (Roche Applied Science), 0.5 μl of Vent polymerase (2 units/μl; Roche Applied Science), 1 μl 10 mm dNTP, 10 μm each forward and reverse primer (MWG-Biotech; Table I), 2 μl of cDNA (plus or minus RT), and 17 μl of H2O. PCR cycling conditions were 95 °C for 1 min and then 30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 64-68 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. Amplified fragments were then cloned into pGEM-T and sequenced. For reverse transcribed cDNAs generated from LPS-treated RAW264.7 cells, the following reaction was used involving 2.5 μl of 10× Taq buffer (Promega), 3 μl of 25 mm MgCl2 (Promega), 1 μl of 2.5 mm dNTP, 1 μl of 10 μm each forward and reverse primers (Table I), cDNA (plus or minus RT), 0.175 μl of Taq (5 units/μl; Promega) and 14.325 μl of H2O. PCR cycling conditions for these reactions were 94 °C for 30 s and then 35 cycles at 94 °C for 10 s, 67 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 30 s followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 2 min. For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene RT-PCR, identical conditions were used except for an annealing temperature of 55 °C and 25 cycles instead of 35. Northern Blotting—Northern blots were carried out using a murine eight-tissue blot (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Blots were hybridized at 68 °C for 90 min with a 1038-bp 32P-labeled Irak2 cDNA fragment (nucleotides (nt) 482-1527) corresponding to exons 4-11 inclusive of the Irak2 gene. Blots were then washed at 50 °C with 0.2× SSC 0.1% SDS and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film for 2 days at -70 °C. Generation of Irak2 Expression Constructs—The entire open reading fames of Irak2a, Irak2b, Irak2c, and Irak2d were amplified by PCR from a murine liver cDNA library (Clontech) using the primers Irak2-14 (for Irak2a, 2b, and 2d), Irak2-15 (for Irak2c), and Irak2-16 as a common reverse primer (Table I). PCR was carried out on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 2400 thermocycler using the following conditions: 2.5 μl 10× Vent; 1 μl of 10 mm dNTP; 0.5 μl of Vent polymerase (2 units/μl); 1 μl of 20 ng/μl cDNA; 1 μl each of 10 μm 5′ and 3′ primers (Table I), and 18 μl of H2O. The following cycling conditions were then used: 95 °C for 1 min; 35 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min; 68 °C for 1 min; and 72 °C for 3 min. All Irak2 constructs were generated to encode in-frame hemagglutinin A tags (YPYDVPDYA) at their C termini using the primer Irak2-17 and contained BamHI and EcoRI linkers at their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively; these linkers were subsequently cleaved with their respective restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs, Hertfordshire, UK), subcloned into pCDNA3.0, and sequenced. Transient Transfection—Cells were seeded at ∼1 × 105 cells/ml into 24-well plates in complete growth media and cultured at 37 °C (in the presence of 5% CO2) until 50-80% confluent. To 17 μl of serum-free media was added 3 μl of GeneJuice™ (Novagen, La Jolla, CA); following mixing and a 5 min incubation at RT, the solution was added to 450 ng of plasmid DNA, gently mixed, incubated for a further 15 min at RT, then added dropwise to each well of the 24-well plate. This was performed in triplicate for each assay point. The composition of the transfected DNA typically consisted of 100 ng of Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK), 200 ng of NF-κB-luciferase reporter, and 25-150 ng of Irak2 expression plasmids, and the remainder was empty vector (pCDNA3.0) up to 150 ng. Following transfection, cells were either left untreated at 37 °C (5% CO2) for 24 h or treated with LPS at 1 μg/ml for 16 h. Optimal treatment times had been determined previously by time course, and total incubation time for all transfected cells was 24 h. Cells were then lysed in 300 μl/well of 1× passive lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min at room temperature, and 30 μl each of the lysate was analyzed in duplicate for firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activity using a Mediators PhL luminometer. Reporter activity was then determined as a function of firefly luciferase activity divided by the Renilla luciferase activity. Differences between means were calculated using Student's t test analysis. Identification of the Murine Irak2 Gene—To identify the murine orthologue of the human IRAK2 gene, a BLAST search of the murine genomic DNA data base using the human IRAK2 cDNA sequence of Muzio et al. (4Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) was performed. A region of significant homology was found on Mus musculus (MMU) chromosome 6 at position E3. This putative Irak gene was not murine Irak1, Irak4, or Irak-M, because these genes lay on other chromosomes; this gene was therefore likely to be Irak2. To obtain a complete annotation of the putative Irak2 gene, ∼120-kb pairs of murine genomic DNA encompassing this gene was analyzed in detail using the NIX suite of programs, which are able to identify putative exons, transcriptional units, polyadenylation signal sequences, CpG islands, and repetitive elements within the genomic sequence to be analyzed. As shown in Fig. 1, the NIX programs were able to readily identify the murine Irak2 gene and the positions of the majority of the individual exons of the Irak2 gene with the exception of exons 3 and 11. This prediction was confirmed by BLASTN and BLASTX analysis and alignment of the huIRAK2 cDNA sequence against the murine genomic sequence. The putative Irak2 gene encompasses ∼55 kb of murine genomic sequence and is transcribed toward the center of MMU chromosome 6 (Fig. 1). ∼7 kb 5′ of the putative exon 1 of Irak2 lies the well predicted murine Von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor gene (VHL; GenBank™ accession number P40338), a multiexon gene of ∼6-kb transcribed in the same orientation as Irak2 (Fig. 1). Immediately 3′ of Irak2 lay another predicted gene with the designation Kiaa0218 (Fig. 1) with strong homology to human KIAA0218, a gene encoding a putative deoxyribonuclease (GenBank™ accession number Q93075). This murine transcriptional unit also appears to be transcribed in the same orientation as VHL and Irak2. The human homologues of all three murine genes are found in exactly the same positions on Homo sapiens chromosome 3p25.3, transcribed toward the centromere (data not shown). Located further 3′ of murine Kiaa0218, transcribed in the opposite orientation, was a putative transcriptional unit (the Ghr gene) encoding the murine Ghrelin precursor (also known as the growth hormone secretagogue, the growth hormone-releasing peptide, the motilin-related peptide, and the M46 protein; GenBank™ accession no. Q9EQX0) (Fig. 1). Identification of Multiple Irak2 cDNAs—To obtain Irak2 cDNA sequence information, primers were designed (Irak2-1 and Irak2-2; Table I) within two regions of murine genomic sequence with high homology to the human IRAK2 cDNA; these primers were also located at either end of the putative gene (exons 2 and 12) to amplify as much cDNA as possible. Surprisingly, RT-PCR amplification from a MEF cDNA using these primers library yielded two fragments of ∼1200 and 1350 bp (Fig. 2A), which strongly suggested differential splicing of the murine Irak2 gene. No products were amplified from minus RT MEF cDNA, demonstrating that these products were not the result of genomic DNA contamination (data not shown). Upon sequencing of these PCR products, it was determined that the larger cDNA fragment (designated Irak2a) was encoded by exons 2-12, inclusive, of the putative Irak2 gene. The amplified cDNA sequence also matched the predicted exons, thus providing confirmation of the efficacy of the prediction programs used. The smaller cDNA fragment lacked a sequence encoded by exon 3 but was otherwise identical to the larger amplified cDNA; this cDNA therefore appeared to be a variant of Irak2 (we have designated this cDNA Irak2b). To further annotate the genomic structure of Irak2, identify its 5′ and 3′ ends, and identify additional Irak2 variants, RACE PCR was performed using murine thymus, placenta, liver, and MEF RACE cDNA libraries, with similar results obtained. 5′-RACE and nested 5′-RACE PCR was first performed using primers located in exons 6 and 5, respectively (Irak2-3 and Irak2-4; Table I). Two products of ∼650 and 500 bp were amplified (Fig. 2B); the larger fragment, when sequenced, corresponded to Irak2a, and the smaller fragment corresponded to the exon 3-deficient Irak2b. A smaller PCR product of ∼400 bp was also observed (Fig 2B); upon sequencing, this product turned out to be nonspecific. 5′-RACE also identified the putative exon 1 and two distinct 5′ terminations at positions 1 and 33 of the Irak2a cDNA. Also identified by 5′-RACE were several 650- and 500-bp clones (Fig. 2B) that generated further variant Irak2 cDNA sequences. Several of the 650-bp cDNA fragments generated utilized the 3′ 420 bp of intron 3 before reading directly into exon 4; we designated this isoform Irak2c. Several 500-bp cDNA fragments were also found to contain an Irak2 cDNA sequence similar to that of Irak2a but lacking a sequence encoded by exon 2; this isoform has been designated Irak2d. To confirm the existence of the Irak2c and Irak2d cDNAs, RT-PCR was performed using a MEF cDNA library (Fig. 2C) and isoform-specific primers (Irak2-5 and Irak-6 for Irak2c; Irak2-7 and Irak-6 for Irak2d). The Irak2c and Irak2d RT-PCR reactions generated 400- and 510-bp PCR products, respectively; these were sequenced and the results confirmed the presence of these isoforms. As final confirmation, the open reading frames of all putative Irak2 isoforms were amplified by RT-PCR using Irak2-8 and Irak2-9 primers for Irak2a, 2b and 2d cDNAs, and Irak2-5 (exon 4′) and Irak2-9 for Irak2c (Data not shown). The Irak2a is the same cDNA as that previously described (18Rosati O. Martin M.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Amplification of the Irak2d cDNA also revealed a 30-nt deletion in exon 12 in addition to the deleted exon 2 (data not shown). For all RT-PCR reactions, no PCR products were generated using a minus RT MEF cDNA library (data not shown). To locate the 3′-end of the Irak2 gene, 3′-RACE was performed using the Irak2-10 and Irak2-11 primers located in exons 11 and 12, respectively (Table I). A single PCR fragment of ∼350-bp was generated (Fig. 2D), which, upon sequencing, was found to contain an Irak2 cDNA sequence encoding exons 12 and 13. All four Irak2 cDNA sequences were confirmed against the murine genomic sequence data base by BLASTN and BLASTX and have been deposited into GenBank™ under the accession numbers AY162378, AY162379, AY162380, and AY162381. Gene Structure and Alternative Splicing of Murine Irak2—The murine Irak2 gene is composed of 13 exons and 12 introns and encodes a predicted full-length protein of 622 amino acids (aa) (Fig. 3A and Table II). Full-length Irak2 contains a well predicted kinase domain (aa 206-471) and a weakly predicted DD (aa 14-93). Exon 1 contains the common 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of Irak2a, 2b, and 2d, as well as their common initiating codon (ATG), and also encodes the N terminus (aa 1-13). Exon 2 encodes the entire DD; exons 3 and 4 encode what we now designate as the α and β subdomains of the interdomain (aa 94-205), respectively; exons 5-11 encode the kinase domain; exons 12 and 13 encode the C terminus (aa 472-622); and the termination codon for all Irak2 variants lies in exon 13 (Fig. 3A). Irak2c has its own 5′-UTR (designated exon 4′) that is encoded by a 5′ continuation of exon 4. Intron sizes range from 83 bp (intron 5) to almost 18 kb (intron 2), and the intron-exon boundaries of Irak2 conform to the GT-AG rule (Fig. 3A) (19Shapiro M. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) (Table II). The three possible codon disruption phases are present in the Irak2 gene splice junctions; introns 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11 disrupt exons between amino acids (phase 0), introns 1, 2, and 3 interrupt a codon between the first and second nucleotide (phase 1), and introns 6 and 8 disrupt a codon between the second and third nucleotide (phase 2) (Table II).Table IIIntron-exon boundaries of the murine Irak2 gene3′ Splice acceptor siteExonBase pairs5′ Splice acceptor siteIntronBase pairsSplice phase1154GGATGCAGTTCGgtgagtgaca19,0361W M Q FtgccttccagCTTCCTACGTGA2183TTGTCTTGAGCTgtgagtaact217,8801A S Y VI V L ScttgttccagGGAAGCCGGTTC3144TTCTAGACACAGgtgctctcct34,3521W K P VL L D TtcctttctagGGCCCATCATGG495CCCCAGTCTAAGgtaaatccac42,4450G P I MP Q S KcaatctccagTATTGCAGTACT5201AAGCTCAGGGAGgtgaggtgag5830Y C S TK L R EtttcccacagGTGGCCGGCTCC665GCTCTGCCTCAGgtaagcttcc62,5432V A G SL C L RctgggttcagATGCTGCCACGC7115CTCTGGGCTCAGgtaaaccagt78440C C H AL W A QtttctcttagGGCAACTCAGAC8110CAATGTTAAGAGgtgagagggc81,9502G N S DN V K StttcccgcagTGCCAACGTCTT9196AGCTGTGGAATTgtaagcattt93,8880A N V LS C G ItcctacccagGTATTGGCCGAG1063CCAGTTTACCTGgtaagagatc103,8300V L A EP V Y LcttcccatagAAGGATTTGCTT11201AGCGTGGAGGAGgtgagctctc112,3590K D L LS V E EctcctccaagGCACGAGTCTCC12290CACCCCAGAACGgtaagcttgg122,609A R V StgaacatcagCTACAGAGACTT13131 Open table in a new tab The alternative splicing of Irak2 isoforms is shown in detail in Fig. 3B. Irak2a utilizes every exon consecutively. However, Irak2b and Irak2d are generated by the deletion of exons 3 and 2, respectively, in a process called exon skipping. Irak2d also utilizes an alternative splice acceptor site 30 bp into exon 12, which causes the deletion of 10 amino acids (designated the C-box) in the C terminus (Fig. 3D). The function of"

Because SP-D specifically interacts with neutrophils that infiltrate the lung in response to acute inflammation and infection, we examined the hypothesis that the neutrophil-derived serine proteinases (NSPs): neutrophil elastase, proteinase-3, and cathepsin G degrade SP-D. All three human NSPs specifically cleaved recombinant rat and natural human SP-D dodecamers in a time- and dose-dependent manner, which was reciprocally dependent on calcium concentration. The NSPs generated similar, relatively stable, disulfide cross-linked immunoreactive fragments of ∼35 kDa (reduced), and sequencing of a major catheptic fragment definitively localized the major sites of cleavage to a highly conserved subregion of the carbohydrate recognition domain. Cleavage markedly reduced the ability of SP-D to promote bacterial aggregation and to bind to yeast mannan in vitro. Incubation of SP-D with isolated murine neutrophils led to the generation of similar fragments, and cleavage was inhibited with synthetic and natural serine proteinase inhibitors. In addition, neutrophils genetically deficient in neutrophil elastase and/or cathepsin G were impaired in their ability to degrade SP-D. Using a mouse model of acute bacterial pneumonia, we observed the accumulation of SP-D at sites of neutrophil infiltration coinciding with the appearance of ∼35-kDa SP-D fragments in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. Together, our data suggest that neutrophil-derived serine proteinases cleave SP-D at sites of inflammation with potential deleterious effects on its biological functions.

Together, our data suggest that neutrophil-derived serine proteinases cleave SP-D at sites of inflammation with potential deleterious effects on its biological functions. The lung relies on numerous mechanisms to defend itself against various infectious or toxic agents. When the first lines of defense against microorganisms are breached, neutrophils rapidly accumulate in the lung. The primary purpose of this neutrophilic infiltration is the killing of microorganisms and resolution of the associated inflammation (1Smith J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 672-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Among neutrophil antimicrobial molecules are three active neutrophil serine proteinases (NSPs) 1The abbreviations used are: NSPs, neutrophil serine proteinases; SP, surfactant protein; hSP-D, human surfactant protein D; RrSP-D, recombinant rat SP-D; RrSP-Dbiotin, biotinylated recombinant rat SP-D; RrSP-Dmaltose, maltosyl-agarose eluted recombinant rat SP-D; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; NE, neutrophil elastase; PR3, proteinase-3; CG, cathepsin G; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; SLPI, recombinant human secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor; MNEI, recombinant human monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor; fMLP, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; HPLC, high-pres-sure liquid chromatography; OD, optical density; WT, wild type; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; hBAL, human bronchoalveolar lavage; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.: neutrophil elastase (NE), proteinase-3 (PR3), and cathepsin G (CG) (2Ganz T. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1999; 111: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). NE, PR3, and CG are structurally related endopeptidases with different but overlapping specificities whose catalytic activities rely on the triad, His57-Asp102-Ser195 (chymotrypsinogen numbering), where Ser is the active amino acid (3Bode W. Meyer Jr., E. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1951-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). NSPs are stored in active forms at high concentrations in the primary granules and are rapidly discharged into the phagocytic vacuoles following bacterial uptake by neutrophils (4Belaaouaj A. Microb. Infect. 2002; 4: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cell surface localization and/or extracellular release of active NSPs by activated neutrophils has also been documented (5Owen C.A. Campbell M.A. Boukedes S.S. Campbell E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L385-L393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NSPs can cleave many substrates that include extracellular matrix proteins, coagulation factors, cytokines, and immunoglobulins (6Lee W.L. Downey G.P. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 164: 896-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). As a consequence, unchecked release of NSPs can mediate tissue injury. In particular, NSPs contribute to the pathogenesis of tissue destruction in such diverse diseases as acute respiratory distress syndrome, emphysema, and cystic fibrosis (7Kawabata K. Hagio T. Matsuoka S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 451: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 8Janoff A. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1985; 132: 417-433PubMed Google Scholar, 9Birrer P. Respiration. 1995; 62: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence that collagenous lectins (collectins) play critical roles in the innate host defense, as well as surfactant homeostasis (10Crouch E. Hartshorn K. Ofek I. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Surfactant protein D (SP-D), a member of the collectin family, is synthesized and secreted in the lung by alveolar type II cells and Clara cells; however, it is also expressed at mucosal surfaces and other extrapulmonary sites. The antimicrobial host defense activities of SP-D are diverse and include microbial agglutination, opsonization, modulation of phagocyte function, antigen presentation, and direct effects on microbial growth (11Mason R. Greene K. Voelker D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12LeVine A.M. Whitsett J.A. Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E.C. Korfhagen T.R. J.

Investig. 2003; 111: 1589-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). SP-D consists of trimeric subunits and each subunit is composed of four domains. The NH2-terminal domain contains two conserved cysteine residues that stabilize the association of trimeric sub-units, whereas the rod-like collagen domain contains the only site of N-linked glycosylation. The link or coiled-coil neck domain joins the collagen domain to the fourth region: the COOH-terminal, C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (14Hakansson K. Reid K.B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1607-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The CRD mediates the Ca2+-dependent interactions of SP-D with microbial cell wall glycoconjugates and surfactant lipids. Whereas CRD monomers can recognize these ligands, the trimerization of CRDs is necessary for high affinity binding, and the oligomerization of trimeric subunits is required for agglutination and bridging interactions (15Kishore U. Reid K.B. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2001; 33: 225-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 177-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The expression of SP-D is rapidly increased following many types of lung injury (17McIntosh J.C. Swyers A.H. Fisher J.H.

Neutrophil-mediated clearance of SP-D is increased during the first few hours following instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (23Herbein J.F. Wright J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L268-L277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying these changes in SP-D levels are poorly understood. As indicated above, acute inflammation is usually accompanied by a massive accumulation of activated neutrophils. In this regard, SP-D can directly interact with neutrophils (24Cai G.Z. Griffin G.L.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 2727-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SP-D-deficient mice show an exaggerated neutrophil response to viral and bacterial challenge (12LeVine A.M. Whitsett J.A. Hartshorn K.L. Crouch E.C. Korfhagen T.R. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5868-5873Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest a complex interplay between neutrophils and SP-D in vivo. Little is known about the proteolytic degradation of lung SP-D, particularly by leukocyte-derived proteinases. All three NSPs have been shown to cleave SP-A (30Liau D.F. Yin N.X. Huang J. Ryan S.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 31Pison U. Tam E.K. Caughey G.H. Hawgood S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 992: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, NE has been shown to cleave SP-D in vitro (32Griese M. Wiesener A. Lottspeich F. von Bredow C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1638: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); however, the effects of other NSPs have not been investigated. Whether NSPs degrade SP-D inside and/or outside neutrophils is also still unclear. Previous studies of recombinant rat SP-D suggest that it is resistant to degradation by several matrix metalloproteinases including those expressed by neutrophils (33Brown-Augsburger P. Hartshorn K. Chang D. Rust K. Fliszar C. Welgus H.G. Crouch E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13724-13730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Neutrophils can degrade SP-A (34Schochett P. Mora R. Mark L. Butler M. Ingenito E.P. Exp. Lung Res. 1999; 25: 595-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but the neutrophil-mediated degradation of SP-D has not been described in vitro or in vivo. The present study was undertaken to determine whether NSPs can degrade SP-D with resultant effects on its function. Here, we present evidence that all three active NSPs and neutrophils cause specific cleavage within a conserved subregion of the SP-D CRD. In particular, CG cleaved SP-D at a Phe304-Thr305 bond slightly NH2-terminal to the carbohydrate binding site resulting in a significant decrease in lectin activity. In addition, we used mouse neutrophils deficient in specific NSPs to demonstrate that these proteinases contribute to SP-D degradation and found that neutrophil-mediated cleavage is inhibited by physiological serine proteinase inhibitors. Furthermore, experiments using a mouse model of bacterial pneumonia strongly suggest that neutrophil-derived serine proteinases can degrade SP-D in vivo. Reagents—Purified NE, CG, and PR3 from human sputum and elastin from bovine neck ligaments were purchased from Elastin Products Company, Inc. (Owensville, MO) and from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). The purity and activity of each enzyme were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and spectrophotometrically using specific substrates according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The chromogenic peptide substrates were N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide, N-Boc-Ala-ONp, and N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide for NE, PR3, and CG, respectively. Proteinase inhibitors: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and human plasma α1-antitrypsin were from Sigma. 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) was from Roche Applied Science. Recombinant human secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MI). Recombinant human monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor (MNEI) was produced in insect cells and purified as previously described (35Remold-O'Donnell E. Chin J. Alberts M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5635-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 36Cooley J. Takayama T.K. Shapiro S.D. Schechter N.M. Remold-O'Donnell E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15762-15770Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies specific for rat and human SP-D were prepared and characterized as previously described (37Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 241-248PubMed Google Scholar, 38Persson A. Chang D. Rust K. Moxley M. Longmore W. Crouch E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6361-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antibody to mouse SP-D was purchased from Chemicon (Ab3434; Temecula, CA). Polyclonal rabbit antibody to mouse CG was kindly provided by T. Ley (Washington University). Rabbit serum was purchased from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Except where indicated, all other chemicals were reagent grade and purchased from Sigma. Human Samples, Mice, and Bacteria—Natural human SP-D (hSP-D) dodecamers were isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from alveolar proteinosis patients as previously described (37Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 241-248PubMed Google Scholar). Normal human BAL (hBAL) fluids were obtained in conjunction with a prior study of surfactant protein A as described in Rubio and co-workers (39Rubio F. Cooley J. Accurso F.J. Remold-O'Donnell E. Thorax. 2004; 59: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Remainders of BAL specimens were selected for study of SP-D that had normal levels of surfactant proteins and lacked detectable signs of infection. Mice deficient in NE (NE-/-) or CG (CG-/-) were generated by targeted mutagenesis as previously described (40Belaaouaj A. McCarthy R. Baumann M. Gao Z. Ley T.J. Abraham S.N. Shapiro S.D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 41MacIvor D.M. Shapiro S.D. Pham C.T. Belaaouaj A. Abraham S.N. Ley T.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and backcrossed at least eight generations into 129/SvJ-C57/BL6 genetic background. Mutant and wild type (WT) mice were maintained in the animal barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and provided with water and food ad libitum. All procedures were approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. In this work, we used an uncapsulated phase variant of Klebsiella pneumoniae, K-50 cap-(42Ofek I. Mesika A. Kalina M. Keisari Y. Podschun R. Sahly H. Chang D. McGregor D. Crouch E. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), or Pseudomonas aeruginosa H103 (kindly provided by R. Hancock, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 and grown aerobically in Luria Bertani broth (10 ml) at 37 °C to late exponential phase (3 h). Bacteria were collected by centrifugation (500 × g, 10 min), washed twice, and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Bacteria were quantified by optical density (OD) at 600 nm (OD 1 ≈ 109 bacteria/ml) (40Belaaouaj A. McCarthy R. Baumann M. Gao Z. Ley T.J. Abraham S.N. Shapiro S.D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Purification of SP-D—Recombinant rat SP-D (RrSP-D) was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells as previously described (43Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SP-D was initially purified by affinity chromatography on maltosylagarose. Following elution with EDTA, dodecamers were isolated by gel filtration chromatography on A-15M-agarose in the presence of EDTA. Numerous studies have shown that these molecules are ultrastructurally indistinguishable from the wild-type proteins (43Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, there is no evidence for differences in the specificity or potency of comparably multimerized preparations of the recombinant and natural proteins in various in vitro assays of host defense functions (25Crouch E.C. Persson A. Griffin G.L. Chang D. Senior R.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Where indicated, RrSP-D was eluted from maltosyl-agarose with 10 mm maltose and used without subsequent gel filtration chromatography (RrSP-Dmaltose). Although RrSP-Dmaltose contains a very small fraction of higher order multimers, which are associated at their amino termini, both preparations are pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. All preparations used for these experiments contained low endotoxin (<300 pg/ml) as measured by chromogenic assay (QCL-1000; Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ). For binding studies, RrSP-D was biotinylated (RrSP-Dbiotin) at its glycosylation sites within the collagen domain as recently described (44DeSilva N.S. Ofek I. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Degradation of SP-D by Neutrophil Serine Proteinases—RrSP-D, RrSP-Dmaltose, RrSP-Dbiot, hSP-D, or human BAL fluids were incubated alone or in the presence of the indicated concentrations of NE, PR3, or CG at 37 °C for the designated times. Unless specified, incubations were performed in a 20-μl reaction volume in PBS, in the absence or presence of the indicated concentration of CaCl2, at a final pH of 7.4, which should approximate the pH in the extracellular milieu of the lung. Also, this pH is close to the pH optimum of NSPs, which are most active under basic conditions (45Reeves E.P. Lu H. Jacobs H.L. Messina C.G. Bolsover S. Gabella G. Potma E.O. Warley A. Roes J. Segal A.W. Nature. 2002; 416: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). In some experiments, NSPs were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min with the serine proteinase inhibitors PMSF, AEBSF, or diisopropyl fluorophosphate prior to addition of SP-D. Reaction products were heat-inactivated in SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE (12 or 4-20% gradient gels). Samples were examined with or without prior reduction of sulfhydryl bonds with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol as indicated. Protein bands and proteolytic fragments were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Immunodetection of Cleavage Products—RrSP-D cleavage products or murine and human BAL fluids were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were sequentially incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to rat (dilution, 1:10,000) or mouse (dilution, 1:2,000) SP-D followed by goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive fragments were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) (38Persson A. Chang D. Rust K. Moxley M. Longmore W. Crouch E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6361-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). For quantitative experiments examining the effects of Ca2+, proteins were reacted with rabbit antibody to rat SP-D followed by incubation with 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Labeled proteins or fragments were detected with the Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using ImageQuant 1.2 (Amersham Biosciences). High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and NH2-terminal Sequencing of SP-D Degradation Products—RrSP-D (2.5 μg) was incubated alone or in the presence of CG (2.5 μg) at 37 °C in a 20-μl reaction containing PBS (pH 7.4) and CaCl2 (10 mm). Following incubation for the designated times at 37 °C, the reactions were diluted to 1 ml with PBS and immediately analyzed by reverse phase HPLC (System Gold Analyzer, Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of selected protein fractions were determined by automated Edman degradation (Sequenator 472a; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Bacterial Agglutination Assay—The agglutination assay was performed as previously described with the following modifications (46Hartshorn K.L. White M.R. Crouch E.C. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6129-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). RrSP-D (2.5 μg) was incubated alone or in the presence of CG (2.5 μg) at 37 °Cina20-μl reaction containing PBS (pH 7.4) and CaCl2 (10 mm). Following incubation for 4 h, the reactions were stopped by addition of PMSF (1 mm) and mixed with equal numbers of freshly prepared bacteria (107) in a total volume of 1 ml of PBS/CaCl2. These reactions were performed in duplicate. In one set of reactions, the OD of the bacterial suspension was recorded at 0 and 60 min post-incubation and considered as an index for bacterial agglutination. The other set of reactions were stained for fluorescence microscopy using 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (47Belaaouaj A. Kim K.S. Shapiro S.D. Science. 2000; 289: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Reactions containing bacteria alone were included as controls. Yeast Mannan Binding Assay—RrSP-Dbiotin (1 μg), labeled within the collagen domain, as described above, was incubated alone or in the presence of CG (1 μg) for 4 h at 37 °C in a 20-μl reaction containing PBS (pH 7.4) supplemented with CaCl2 (10 mm). The reactions were stopped by addition of PMSF (1 mm) and transferred to albumin-blocked, mannan-coated wells. Following incubation for 2 h at room temperature, samples were washed and bound proteins were detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD) (44DeSilva N.S. Ofek I. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 29: 757-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Differences in absorbance were determined at 450 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Degradation of SP-D by Neutrophils—Neutrophils were isolated from mutant or WT mice as previously described (40Belaaouaj A. McCarthy R. Baumann M. Gao Z. Ley T.J. Abraham S.N. Shapiro S.D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils were attracted to the peritoneum of mice by intraperitoneal injection with 15% glycogen (1 ml/mouse). Four hours later, mice were sacrificed by CO2 narcosis. The peritoneal cavities were lavaged with 5 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.4, without Ca2+ and Mg2+), and the lavage fluids were spun and resuspended in a hypotonic lysis solution to remove red cell contamination. Neutrophils represented >95% of the cell population and >98% were viable as judged by differential counting and trypan blue dye exclusion. To investigate SP-D cleavage by neutrophils, aliquots of 1 × 106 cells in 200 μl of PBS (pH 7.4) were primed and stimulated by addition of LPS (10 μg/ml) and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP, 1 μm) (48Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). Next, RrSP-D (1 μg) was added and the reactions were incubated overnight at 37 °C at pH 7.4. In some experiments, stimulated WT neutrophils were preincubated with the indicated serine proteinase inhibitors for 5 min at 37 °C prior to addition of SP-D. Controls included RrSP-D incubated alone or with purified CG. Following incubation, samples were acetone-treated for protein extraction, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described above. Under these experimental conditions, over 50% of the cells were dead following overnight incubation, as judged by trypan blue dye exclusion. However, there were no significant differences in viability between unstimulated or LPS/fMLP-stimulated neutrophils. The NSP release was determined using the peptide substrates corresponding to the individual enzymes as described elsewhere (49Lopez-boado Y.S. Espinola M. Bahr S. Belaaouaj A. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mouse Model of Pneumonia—Mice were intranasally challenged with a sublethal dose of P. aeruginosa (H103) bacteria or sterile saline as previously described (50Hirche T.O. Atkinson J.J. Bahr S. Belaaouaj A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine hydrochloride (75 mg/kg) and medotomidine hydrochloride (1 mg/kg) followed by intranasal administration of bacteria (4 × 106 colony forming units/mouse) in 50 μl of PBS. Groups of mice were sacrificed at designated time points, and their lungs were either lavaged in situ using Hanks' balanced salt solution (pH 7.4) or inflated with 10% buffered formalin, excised, and processed for histology (51Belaaouaj A.A. Li A. Wun T.C. Welgus H.G. Shapiro S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27123-27128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell counts from BAL fluids were immediately performed by hemacytometer, and aliquots of BAL fluids were cytospun for differential counting or immunostaining. The remaining BAL samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were aliquoted (1 × 106 cells) and lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100. BAL supernatants and cell lysates were snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C until use. Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Immunohistochemistry on serial lung tissue sections was performed as previously described (51Belaaouaj A.A. Li A. Wun T.C. Welgus H.G. Shapiro S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27123-27128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, formalin fixed lungs were paraffin embedded, sectioned (5 μm), deparaffinized, rehydrated, and microwave-treated for 7 min in PBS to enhance antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase and nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with H2O2 (0.3%) and blocking reagent (Background Eraser; Biocare Medical, Walnut Creek, CA) for 30 min. Sections were incubated with antibodies specific for mouse SP-D (dilution, 1:750) or CG (dilution, 1: 200) at 4 °C overnight. Equivalent concentrations of rabbit preimmune serum were used as a negative control. Next, samples were incubated for 20 min with biotinylated secondary antibody and labeled for 15 min with horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. Immune complexes were visualized using 3′3-diaminobenzidine or Vulcan Fast-Red chromogen (Biocare Medical) as substrates for horseradish peroxidase or alkaline peroxidase, respectively, and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Cytospins from BAL fluids were fixed for 10 min in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, each step followed by three washes in PBS. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min, and cells were incubate"

The cyan fluorescent protein-tagged Gα and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged Gβ subunits were used to develop sensors that coupled selectively with the M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors. In living Chinese hamster ovary cells, imaging showed that sensors emitted a fluorescence resonance energy transfer signal that was abrogated on receptor activation. When sequentially activated with highly expressed muscarinic receptors and endogenous receptors expressed at low levels, sensor molecules were sensitive to the sequence of activation and the receptor numbers. The results distinguish between models proposing that receptor and G protein types interact freely with each other on the cell membrane or that they function as mutually exclusive multimolecular complexes by providing direct support for the former model in these cells. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of muscarinic receptors and G protein subunits tagged with cyan or yellow fluorescent protein showed that receptors and G proteins were mobile and not immobilized on the cell membrane.

The results distinguish between models proposing that receptor and G protein types interact freely with each other on the cell membrane or that they function as mutually exclusive multimolecular complexes by providing direct support for the former model in these cells. G proteins and their receptors have been studied extensively, but it is still not known whether they are immobilized at certain locations on the cell membrane or are capable of diffusing to various regions on the cell membrane. By tagging a muscarinic receptor, a Gα subunit, and the Gβγ complex with CFP 1The abbreviations used are: CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GTP-γ-S, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)tri-phosphate; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid. or YFP and examining living cells with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we have determined that the receptor and G protein subunits are mobile. The mobility of the signaling molecules, however, did not indicate whether particular receptors and G proteins occur in mutually exclusive multimolecular complexes or freely diffuse to collide with each other. A longstanding model proposes that specificity is achieved by mechanisms that allow certain receptor types and G protein types to be associated in exclusive multimolecular complexes (1Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 2Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that receptors and G proteins exist as complexes even in the absence of an agonist stimulus and that G protein activation occurs in isolation from other such molecular assemblies (2Neubig R.R. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 3Hur E.M. Kim K.T. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In a further extension of this model, it has been suggested that receptor-G protein complexes persist during signaling activity (4Rebois R.V. Hebert T.E. Recept. Channels. 2003; 9: 169-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These models would explain how mammalian cells respond to extracellular signals with specificity, although they often express a variety of different receptor and G protein subunit types (5Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism would aid the rapid response to the initial signal because of the association of appropriate receptor and G protein types before activation. Evidence for the presence of assemblies of receptors and G proteins in cell membranes and their potential interaction with adaptor or scaffolding proteins have also been thought to promote such receptor-G protein molecular assemblies (4Rebois R.V. Hebert T.E. Recept. Channels. 2003; 9: 169-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 6Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 473-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An alternative model predicts that receptor types and G protein types are mobile on the cell membrane, colliding with each other freely (1Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar, 10Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). For optimal determination of which of these mechanisms regulate receptor-G protein coupling, living cells need to be used. It has not been possible, however, to examine these models in intact mammalian cells in the absence of appropriate methods. The biochemical approaches that have been used so far to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying G protein signaling have involved cell disruptive methods (11Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). In this study, we used non-invasive imaging methods to examine whether receptors and G proteins exist as multimolecular complexes. We developed a G protein sensor that emits a FRET signal that is sensitive to its activation state. Using this sensor, we directly observed the proportion of active and inactive G proteins by imaging living mammalian cells after the stimulation of particular receptors. We used a cell line expressing significantly different levels of Go coupling receptors to test whether a highly expressed receptor could act in a dominant-negative manner by acting as a sink for all Go molecules in the cell. To examine whether findings from the Go system applied to a different G protein signaling pathway, we mutated the αo protein such that it coupled selectively with Gq coupling receptors. Examining the activation of the Go-q sensor by Gq coupling receptors using a similar experimental approach confirmed the results from the Go system. Chemicals and Expression Constructs—Chemicals were from Sigma unless listed otherwise. Cells were grown in CHO IIIa medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, Fungizone, and methotrexate. CHO cells stably expressing muscarinic receptors (M2-CHO) have been described (12Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). M2-CHO cells were transfected with pDEST12.2 carrying appropriate combinations of αo, αo-CFP, β1, and YFP-β1 (supplementary methods). Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) from R. Y. Tsien (University of California San Diego) were mutated to obtain non-oligomerizing CFP (CFPm1) and non-oligomerizing Citrine (YFPcm1) (14Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar, 29Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Experiments with the Go sensor were performed with CFP/YFP and the experiments with the Go-q sensor with CFPm1/YFPcm1. Stable transfectants were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418, and coexpressors were isolated by flow cytometry and maintained in the above media containing 0.3 mg/ml G418. Expression of fusion proteins was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and by immunoblotting using antibodies to the expressed proteins. The M2-CHO expressing the Go sensor demonstrated growth properties similar to untransfected CHO cells (data not shown). Estimating the Number of Molecules of αο-CFP, YFP-β1, and Endogenous β1 Subunits—Known number of M2-CHO cells stably expressing αο-CFP + YFP-β1 were lysed in SDS sample buffer and examined by immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE with antibodies to αo, β1, or GFP. Densitometry (Image J software) of pure recombinant β1 protein was used to estimate number of molecules per cell. The level of αο-CFP expression was determined similarly by comparing the expression level of αο-CFP with YFP-β1 using GFP-specific antibodies. αo expression was also detected using antibodies specific to αo. Radioligand Binding to Membrane Receptors—Membranes were purified from M2-CHO cells stably expressing αο-CFP + YFP-β1 or transiently expressing M2-YFP and 10 nm [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine (Amersham Biosciences) or 10-50 nm [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (Amersham Biosciences) binding was assayed essentially as described previously (24Azpiazu I. Gautam N. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All operations were conducted at 4 °C and the incubation buffer was supplemented with 10 μm pargyline and 0.1% sodium ascorbate. After 30 min of incubation, samples were filter-washed on glass membranes (Whatman) with chilled buffer. Radioactivity in glass membranes was measured using standard procedures. Localized Photobleaching and Fluorescence Recovery—CHO cells cultured on coverslips were transfected with appropriate constructs using LipofectAMINE. After 24-48 h, the cells were mounted on a 0.25-ml imaging chamber (Warner Instruments) and perfused at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min with Hanks' buffered saline solution supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mg/ml glucose. Fluid delivery was controlled by a fluid delivery system (Automate Scientific). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss 63× oil objective (1.4 numerical aperture) in a Zeiss Axioscope with 20% neutral density filter and 50-watt mercury lamp. The filter wheels were run by a Sutter Lambda 10-2 device to select the following filters in combination with appropriate beam splitters in the filter cube. For CC images: D436/20 excitation, D480/40 emission, and 455DCLP beam splitter; for CY images: D436/20 excitation, D535/30 emission, and 455DCLP beam splitter; and for YY images: D500/20 excitation, D535/30 emission, and 515LP beam splitter. All filters were from Chroma. Images were acquired using a Hamamatsu charge-coupled device Orca-ER Camera. Both camera and filter wheels were controlled peripherally using MetaVue software (Universal Imaging). Cell(s) with similar CC and YY intensities were selected and initial CC, CY, and YY images were recorded. A portion of the cell was bleached with white light for 30 s by positioning that portion of the cell alone in the illuminated field controlled by the diaphragm. Thereafter, the entire cell was moved back into the illuminated field, and CC, CY, or YY images were recorded at various times. Both whole-cell and photo-bleached regions of the plasma membrane were delineated using MetaVue. All images were background-subtracted. Data was plotted as the relative intensity = 100 × (Ixb × Iiw)/(Iib × Ixw) (Ref. 13Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Ixb is the average intensity in the bleached membrane region at time x. Iiw is the average intensity in the whole-cell membrane region at time 0. Iib is the average intensity in the bleached membrane at time 0 s. Ixw is the average intensity in the whole cell membrane region at time x. The introduction of the correction factor (Iib/Iiw) in the formula compensates for any initial uneven distribution of the fluorophore in the cell membrane. Data were fitted to second order polynomial equations. Fluorescence Spectroscopy of Cells in Suspension—M2-CHO cells stably expressing various combinations of the tagged G protein subunits were cultured overnight and analyzed at 2.5 million cells per milliliter. Spectra of the cells were recorded using a Spex Fluoromax-3 spectrofluorometer. Spectra from M2-CHO cells were subtracted from cells expressing G protein sensor or tagged subunits ensuring that emission at 580-600 nm baseline was about the same. For emission spectra resulting from CFP excitation, cell suspensions were excited at 422 nm (5-nm bandpass) and recorded between 460 and 580 nm (5-nm bandpass). For the YFP emission spectra, samples were excited at 488 nm (5 nm bandpass) and recorded between 500 and 600 nm. The excitation wavelengths are not the maximums and were picked to facilitate background subtraction. To examine agonist activation, the emission spectra resulting from CFP excitation of a cell sample were recorded first. Then the same sample was treated with 100 μm carbachol, and after 1 min of incubation, the same spectra were recorded. 10 μm atropine was added immediately; 1 min later, the same emission spectra were recorded. In determining the mean values of the responses to agonist and antagonist, the emission intensities at 478 nm and at 526 nm in the spectra from different experiments were used to determine 526/478 nm ratios. Fluorescence Spectroscopy of the G Protein Sensor in Vitro—M2 CHO cells with or without the sensor αo-CFP+YFP-β1 were cultured overnight, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline solution without calcium/magnesium and lifted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% EDTA. The cell suspension was briefly centrifuged at low speed, and the pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 3 mm MgSO4, 0.05 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors. The density of the cell suspension was adjusted to 2.5 million cells per milliliter. Cyan emission spectra after excitation at 422 nm were recorded for both cell suspensions, and difference spectra were generated as described in the previous paragraph. The presence of FRET at 526 nm shoulder was confirmed visually and by measuring the ratio of E526/E480. Next, 1 ml of cell suspension was supplemented with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and 200 μm GDP, guanosine 5′-O-(2-thio)diphosphate, or GTP-γ-S and lysed in a nitrogen Parr bomb. Homogenates were incubated on ice for 20 min, and the spectra of 250-μl suspensions excited at 422 nm as described earlier were recorded, ensuring the baselines were the same at 600 nm with the addition of homogenate buffer. The spectra of M2-CHO wild-type cell homogenates were subtracted from that of the sensor cell homogenates to obtain the difference spectra. Microscopy, Image Acquisition, and FRET Analysis—Cells were imaged as above. Agonists, antagonists, or vehicle were delivered at a rate of ∼1 ml/min. Images were acquired at the indicated times. Cells were observed and images acquired with an Olympus 60× oil immersion objective (1.3 numerical aperture) or 63× oil immersion Zeiss Plan Apochromat objective (1.4 numerical aperture), 10-20% neutral density filter, and 50- or 100-watt mercury lamp. Appropriate combinations of 430/25 excitation, 470/30 emission, 500/20 excitation, 535/30 emission, and a polychroic beam splitter (Chroma) were used. Exposure times were 1 s with 4 × 4 binning. Images were acquired every 15 s for a total of 4 or 6 min and stored as 12-bit grayscale image stacks using MetaVue. Images were processed using Metamorph (Universal Imaging). Images were background-subtracted and aligned, and plasma membrane regions of entire cells (or most of the cell) were selected after we determined that CC (αο-CFP) and YY (YFP-β1) signals were co-localized. Average intensities in these regions were measured. Ratios of the CY over CC intensities from these regions were plotted as shown in the figures. Images were pseudocolored. Colors were associated with specific ranges of grayscale intensities. Agonist Concentration Dependence of the Decrease in the FRET Signal—Images of live cells were recorded as above for 6 min. At the 90-s time point, cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of carbachol (10 nm-10 μm) and at the 210-s time point, cells were stimulated maximally (with 1 mm). The regression lines were drawn from the baselines obtained using Prism software (GraphPad Software). The percentage of activation by submaximal doses was determined by the formula 100(Rx-Ro)/(Rm-Ro). Rx, Ro, and Rm are the values of the respective regression lines at the 210-s time point, where Ro was the initial baseline, Rx was the submaximal response, and Rm was the maximal response. Image Processing—All CC and CY images corresponding to the data presented were stored in stacks. The CC and CY images were separated and were background-subtracted. Masks were generated using MetaVue from the images in the CC stack. First, the CC images were sharpened and a grayscale intensity value constant was subtracted from these images. The sharpening and substraction of grayscale intensity values results in highlighting the regions where αο-CFP is preponderant (cell membranes and some intracellular particles). Pixels corresponding to the intracellular particles were assigned an intensity value of 0. These images were converted into binary images by assigning a value of 0 or 1 to pixels with 0 or >1 grayscale value. The CY and CC images recorded at each time point were used to obtain a CY/CC ratio image, and the resulting image was multiplied by the corresponding binary image. The intensities in the CY/CC images were pseudocolored where warmer hues represent higher ratios. Stacks were converted to QuickTime (.mov) files. The hues in the initial and final images were set at about the same for the two stacks presented. Legends on the images indicate time points at which agonists were introduced. Calculating the Actual FRET Signal Intensity—To calculate the FRET signal component in the CY signal, the bleed through of the CFP emission into the CY channel and the cross-excitation of YFP by the CFP excitation wavelengths have to be determined and subtracted. M2-CHO cells stably expressing αο-CFP or YFP-β1 were used to identify these components. A, the factor for the cross-excitation of YFP by the CFP excitation wavelengths was the ratio of the emission intensity from YFP-β1 cells using 430/25 excitation and 535/30 emission filters and the emission intensity from the same cells using 500/20 excitation and 535/30 emission filters. B, the factor for the bleed through of CFP excitation wavelengths was the ratio of the emission intensity from αο-CFP cells using 430/25 excitation and 535/30 emission filters and the emission intensity from the same cells using 430/25 excitation and a 470/30 emission. When analyzing cells of different genotypes, we ensured that the CC emission intensity from αο-CFP cells and YY emission intensity from YFP-β1 cells were similar to the corresponding intensities of CC and YY channels of αο-CFP YFP-β1 cells. Ratios were determined from at least five cells, and the mean was used in the calculations below. The FRET signal intensity was calculated using the formula FRET = CY - [A × YY] - [B × CC], where A and B are conversion factors for YFP cross-excitation (0.369) and CFP bleed through (0.709), respectively. The actual FRET signal that occurs between αο-CFP and YFP-β1 was determined by acquiring and analyzing images of CHO cells transiently expressing these proteins as above. Likewise, to determine any potential FRET signal from two non-inter-acting fluorescent proteins targeted to the plasma membrane, αο-CFP and a YFP construct containing a CAAX box at the C terminus to facilitate prenylation and membrane targeting were transiently co-expressed in CHO cells, and the images of these cells were acquired and analyzed as above. Expression of the G Protein Sensor—To obtain cells expressing defined levels of the G protein sensor, we stably integrated the cDNAs for Gαo tagged with CFP (14Zhang J. Campbell R.E. Ting A.Y. Tsien R.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) and Gβ1 tagged with YFP into the genome of M2-CHO cells (Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the M2 muscarinic receptor) (12Azpiazu I.

Capon D.J. Science. 1987; 236: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The M2-CHO cells do not contain endogenous muscarinic receptors but express the stably integrated M2 receptor cDNA (12Azpiazu I. Cruzblanca H. Li P. Linder M. Zhuo M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35305-35308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The CFP molecule was inserted downstream of Gly92 in Gαo because this region forms a loop that projects away from the βγ complex in the crystal structure of the G protein, and the Dictyostelium discoideum Gα subunit is active when it is fused to CFP in a similar fashion (17Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 18Janetopoulos C. Jin T. Devreotes P. Science. 2001; 291: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The YFP molecule was fused to the N terminus of Gβ1. It was anticipated that fusion to the N terminus would not affect receptor interaction based on the model for receptor interaction of the G protein (15Azpiazu I. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41742-41747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the innocuous effect of YFP-tagged D. discoideum β subunit on interaction with a D. discoideum receptor (18Janetopoulos C. Jin T. Devreotes P. Science. 2001; 291: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Endogenous Gγ subunits in the CHO cells were expected to form viable YFP-β1γ complexes. Association of α-CFP subunit and YFP-βγ complex was expected to bring the YFP and CFP molecules sufficiently close for FRET to occur, and receptor activation was expected to abrogate the FRET signal as a result of subunit dissociation (Fig. 1A) (18Janetopoulos C. Jin T. Devreotes P. Science. 2001; 291: 2408-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Images of M2-CHO cells expressing the G protein sensor were captured at different excitation and emission wavelengths (Fig. 1, B-D) (see “Materials and Methods”). The FRET emission is observed in the CY channel (along with bleed through of CFP emission and YFP emission caused by excitation by the CFP excitation wavelengths; discussed below). When images of cells expressing αο-CFP + YFP-β1 were captured in the different channels, αο-CFP and YFP-β1 were localized predominantly in the plasma membrane as anticipated (Fig. 1B). The presence of the β1-YFP fusion on the plasma membrane indicated that it was in complex with a lipid-modified endogenous γ subunit. Furthermore, the distribution of αο-CFP is similar to the distribution of the YFP-β1γ complex, suggesting that the subunits are mostly in the heterotrimer form. This result also indicates that the αο-CFP + YFP-β1γ complex is representative of the heterotrimer population in the cell, which will also consist of αο-CFP or YFP-β1γ in complex with endogenous untagged α and β subunits. We determined using immunoblotting with specific antibodies that the introduced YFP-β subunit formed about 45% of the total β1 subunit in the cell (αo is not detectable in these cells) and that the levels of expressed αο-CFP and YFP-β1 were approximately equal (see “Materials and Methods”). The plasma membrane region in which the G protein sensor was localized was selected when analyzing images of cells to determine the effect of agonists or antagonists on the activation state of the G protein sensor (Fig. 1C). We confirmed using cells expressing αο-CFP or YFP-β1 that CFP emission is observed in the CC channel but not in the YY channel, and YFP emission is observed in the YY channel but not in the CC channel (Fig. 1D). Bleed through of CFP emission from αo-CFP and cross-excitation of YFP-βγ are seen in the corresponding CY channels. Mobility of Receptor and G Protein on the Cell Membrane—At first, to examine whether receptors and G proteins are immobilized at specific regions of the cell membrane or whether they are capable of diffusing to various parts of the cell membrane, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments (19Dewitt S. Hallett M.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) on CHO cells transiently expressing YFP-tagged M2 or αο-CFP + YFP-β1. Expression of M2-YFP was independently confirmed by the presence of [3H]-N-methyl scopolamine binding sites in M2-YFP transfected cells (see “Materials and Methods”). A randomly selected region of a cell was bleached. Fluorescence was recovered in the bleached area over a period of time in the case of M2-YFP cells and cells expressing αο-CFP YFP-β1 (Fig. 2, A and B). The average intensity in the whole-cell membrane region at different times was used as a correction factor as described under “Materials and Methods” to control for any changes in fluorescence emission that resulted from causes other than the mobility of the fluorescent protein into the bleached region of the cell membrane. Plotting the time course of recovery indicated that within 5 min, about 70 to 85% of M2-YFP (receptor YY), αo-CFP (G protein CC), YFP-β (G protein YY), and G protein heterotrimer (G protein CY (see below)) were recovered in the bleached region (Fig. 2C). The time course also indicated that recovery was not complete, especially in the case of the receptor (Fig. 2C). It is thus likely that most of the receptor proteins will be capable of diffusion into the bleached region over a longer period. This slower diffusion of the receptor in contrast to the G protein subunits is consistent with the slower diffusion of transmembrane proteins compared with peripherally associated proteins (20Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 103: 181-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although it cannot be ruled out that a relatively small proportion of each of these molecules is immobile, the result indicates that receptors and G proteins are unlikely to be immobilized on the cell membrane as in Fig. 3A. In these cells, the predominant proportions of the receptor, G protein subunits, and G protein heterotrimer are capable of free movement to any part of the cell membrane, as shown in Fig. 3, B and C. These results, however, do not indicate whether certain receptor and G protein types are present as pre-existing complexes that diffuse as multimolecular assemblies or whether they freely diffuse to collide with each other (Fig. 3, B or C). To distinguish between these models, we developed a G protein sensor as described below.Fig. 3Competing models that propose mechanisms at the basis of receptor-G protein association.A, particular receptor types and G protein types may be present as exclusive complexes (within circle) ensuring rapid responses to a signal and selective activation of pathways. Such complexes may be immobile and localized to specific regions on the cell membrane. B, on the other hand, such complexes may be mobile but receptor and G protein types may still reside and function within these multimolecular complexes. C, finally, G proteins and receptors may freely diffuse along the cell membrane to interact with each other randomly and stochastically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The G Protein Sensor in Living Cells Emits a FRET Signal Measurable Using Spectroscopy—We first examined whether the G protein sensor (αo-CFP YFP-βγ) emitted a FRET signal and whether this signal was sensitive to the activation state of the G protein using spectrofluorometric and imaging experiments (21Lippincott-Schwartz J.

Spectra from M2-CHO cells expressing αο-CFP + YFP-β1 were compared at the excitation wavelength for CFP (422 nm) with cells expressing α-CFP alone. In αο-CFP + YFP-β1 cells, the appearance of an emission peak at 526 nm was observed along with a corresponding decrease in the emission peak of CFP (478 nm) (Fig. 4A). This peak corresponded with the emission peak observed when the same cells were excited at 488 nm; in addition, no emission was observed when αο-CFP cells were excited at 488 nm or YFP-β1 cells at 422 nm (supplementary Fig. 4). These results are consistent with a FRET signal originating from YFP because of CFP excitation, caused by G protein subunits forming a heterotrimer (Fig. 1A). Abrogatio"
https://openalex.org/W1523746131,"Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) frequently harbors the PAX8/PPARγ fusion gene (PPFP); however, its oncogenic role and mechanism(s) of action remain undefined. We investigated PPFP's effects on cell growth, apoptosis, cell–cell, and cell–matrix interactions in immortalized human thyroid cells (Nthy-ori 3-1) and NIH 3T3 cells. PPFP expression increased the growth of transient and stable Nthy-ori transfectants (∼threefold by 72 h). There was an 8.4% increase of cells in the S+G2/M phase, a 7.8% decrease in cells in the G0+G1 phase and a 66% decline in apoptosis at 72 h. Stable Nthy-ori PPFP transfectants grew in soft agar, and PPFP-transfected NIH 3T3 cells exhibited efficient focus formation, suggesting loss of anchorage-dependent growth and contact inhibition, respectively. Overexpression of PPARγ in Nthy-ori cells did not recapitulate PPFP's growth effects. Treatment of Nthy-ori cells with an irreversible PPARγ inhibitor mimicked the growth-promoting effects of PPFP and co-expression of PPFP and PPARγ blocked PPARγ transactivation activity. Our data provide functional evidence that PPFP acts as an oncoprotein, whose transforming properties depend in part on inhibition of PPARγ. Our data suggest that PPFP contributes to malignant transformation during FTC oncogenesis by acting on several cellular pathways, at least some of which are normally regulated by PPARγ."
https://openalex.org/W1965261663,"Indirubin, a bis-indole obtained from various natural sources, is responsible for the reported antileukemia activity of a Chinese Medicinal recipe, Danggui Longhui Wan. However, its molecular mechanism of action is still not well understood. In addition to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases and glycogen synthase kinase-3, indirubins have been reported to activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a cotranscriptional factor. Here, we confirm the interaction of AhR and indirubin using a series of indirubin derivatives and show that their binding modes to AhR and to protein kinases are unrelated. As reported for other AhR ligands, binding of indirubins to AhR leads to its nuclear translocation. Furthermore, the apparent survival of AhR−/− and +/+ cells, as measured by the MTT assay, is equally sensitive to the kinase-inhibiting indirubins. Thus, the cytotoxic effects of indirubins are AhR-independent and more likely to be linked to protein kinase inhibition. In contrast, a dramatic cytostatic effect, as measured by actual cell counts and associated with a sharp G1 phase arrest, is induced by 1-methyl-indirubins, a subfamily of AhR-active but kinase-inactive indirubins. As shown for TCDD (dioxin), this effect appears to be mediated through the AhR-dependent expression of p27KIP1. Altogether these results suggest that AhR activation, rather than kinase inhibition, is responsible for the cytostatic effects of some indirubins. In contrast, kinase inhibition, rather than AhR activation, represents the main mechanism underlying the cytotoxic properties of this class of promising antitumor molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2018647118,"In a population of cells undergoing oxidative stress, an individual cell either succumbs to apoptotic cell death or maintains homeostasis and survives. Exposure of PC-12-D2R cells to 200 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induces apoptosis in about half of cells after 24 h. After 1-h exposure to 200 μm H2O2, both antiapoptotic extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and pro-apoptotic Ser-15-p53 phosphorylation are observed. Microarray and real-time PCR assays of gene expression after H2O2 exposure identified several transcripts, including egr1, that are rapidly induced downstream of ERK. Single cell analysis of egr1 induction and of phospho-ERK and phospho-p53 formation revealed the presence of two distinct cellular programs. Whereas the proportion of cells activating ERK versus p53 at 1 h depended on H2O2 concentration, individual cells showed exclusively either phospho-p53 formation or activation of ERK and egr1 induction. Exposure to H2O2 for 1 h also elicited these two non-overlapping cellular responses in both dopaminergic SN4741 cells and differentiated postmitotic PC-12-D2R cells. Repressing p53 with pifithrin-α or small interfering RNA increased ERK phosphorylation by H2O2, indicating that p53-dependent suppression of ERK activity may contribute to the bi-stable single cell responses observed. By 24 h, the subset of cells in which ERK activity was suppressed exhibit caspase 3 activation and the nuclear condensation characteristic of apoptosis. These studies suggest that the individual cell rapidly and stochastically processes the oxidative stress stimulus, leading to an all-or-none cytoprotective or pro-apoptotic signaling response.

These observations suggest that ROS can damage various cell components or activate specific physiological signaling pathways, with the relative effects determined by ROS concentration. Oxidative stress has been reported to activate seemingly contradictory signaling pathways, and the consequences of the response vary widely; the ultimate outcome is dependent on the balance between these stress-activated pathways (12Finkel T.

Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5033) Google Scholar). Among the main stress signaling pathways and/or central mediators activated in response to oxidant injury are the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) (14Houle F. Rousseau S. Morrice N. Luc M.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, the heat shock response, ERK, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways exert a pro-survival influence during oxidant injury, whereas activation of p53, JNK, and p38 are implicated in apoptosis (see review in Ref. 12Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7300) Google Scholar). ROS, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are natural byproducts generated by living organisms as a consequence of aerobic metabolism (27Fridovich I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 893: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The cellular toxicity of H2O2 is associated with the rapid modification of cellular constituents, including the depletion of intracellular glutathione and ATP, a decrease in NAD+ level, an increase in free cytosolic Ca2+, and lipid peroxidation (28Fernandez-Checa J. Kaplowitz N. Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Miranda M. Mari M. Ardite E. Morales A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G7-G17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2 also activates the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and the release of cytochrome c (29Yang J.C. Cortopassi G.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, cytochrome c, in combination with Apaf-1, activates caspase-9 leading to the activation of caspase-3 and subsequent apoptosis (30Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2264) Google Scholar). The initiating events leading to activation of these different signaling pathways in response to H2O2 are incompletely understood. We have reported recently that H2O2 induces apoptosis in PC-12-D2R cells and in the nigral dopaminergic neuronal cell line SN4741 in a concentration-dependent manner (31Nair V.D. Olanow W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Nair V.D. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47053-47061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that when exposed to a level of oxidative stress that can induce apoptosis in a portion of cells, each individual cell must proceed through a decision-making process that ultimately results either in its survival or its death. We report here that early after H2O2 exposure, each cell activates either homeostatic or proapoptotic signaling pathways, but not both. Our results indicate that it may be challenging to develop models of the mechanism of oxidative stress-induced cell death based solely on cell population and biochemical assays.

For differentiation, PC-12-D2R cells were plated on to collagen-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum and allowed to attach overnight. The cells were then induced to differentiate by growing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor for 7 days. Substantia nigra dopaminergic neuronal cell line SN4741 was cultured as described previously (33Son J.H. Chun H.S. Joh T.H. Cho S. Conti B. Lee J.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal C630, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovandate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected by immunoblotting using the ECL system according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The blots were then stripped in buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C and re-probed with respective antibodies. Gene Expression Analysis—PC-12-D2R cells were treated with 200 μm H2O2 or vehicle for 1 h, and total RNA was isolated using StrataPrep total RNA miniprep kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Preparation of cRNA, hybridization, and scanning of the rat genome U34 arrays were performed as described previously (34Wurmbach E. Yuen T. Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e48Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Affymetrix microarray suite 5.0 was used to analyze the raw data using the criteria of 60% concordance across multiple array comparisons and -fold changes ≥1.6 for outlier detection. For each of the up-regulated targets, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was carried out in an ABI Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using SYBR-Green assay, as described previously (35Yuen T. Wurmbach E. Pfeffer R.L. Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e48Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 36Yuen T. Zhang W. Ebersole B.J. Sealfon S.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 556-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All the gene-specific primer sets used for qPCR are listed in supplemental table. The authenticity of the PCR products was verified by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis. The comparative cycle threshold (CT) method was used to analyze the data by generating relative values of the amount of target cDNA. Relative quantitation for any given gene, expressed as -fold variation over control (untreated cells), was calculated after determination of the difference between CT of the given gene A and that of the calibrator gene B (β-actin) in treated cells (ΔCT1 = CT1A - CTB) and untreated cells (ΔCT0 = CT0A - CTB) using the 2-ΔΔCT (1–0) formula (37Applied BiosystemsUser Bulletin 2. Relative Quantitation of Gene Expression. Foster City, CA1997: 1-36Google Scholar). CT values are means of triplicate measurements. Experiments were repeated three to five times. Immunocytochemistry—PC-12-D2R cells growing on collagen-coated or SN4741 cells growing on ploy-ornithine-coated cover glass were treated as indicated. The cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (31Nair V.D. Olanow W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Nair V.D. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47053-47061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and immunocytochemical staining for phospho-ERK, phospho-p53, or active caspase-3 was carried out. Anti-phospho-ERK (1:400), anti-phospho-p53 (1:500), or active caspase-3 antibody (1:200) was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. For double-immunolabeling, a mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK antibody was used. After washing, cells were incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and the nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml (in phosphate-buffered saline) of the fluorescent DNA dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) for 10 min and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The liquid was drained and the slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) mounting medium. Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization—Egr1 (161 bp) and β-actin (150 bp) DNA fragments were amplified from RNA isolated from PC-12-D2R cells by reverse transcription PCR using primer sets described in supplemental table. The DNA fragments were purified from agarose gel using QIAEX II gel extraction kit and sub-cloned into pDrive vector. Individual clones were sequenced to determine the orientation of the DNA. To generate cRNA probes, we used T7 promoter for antisense and SP6 promoter for sense probes to minimize the interference of vector sequences in double fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Aminoallyl-UTP incorporated cRNA probes were generated using Maxiscript in vitro transcription kit. The yield and integrity of riboprobes was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The egr1 and β-actin cRNA probes were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 and CY3, respectively, according to manufacturer's protocols. The riboprobes were purified on atlas nucleospin columns. The cells grown on cover slips were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (31Nair V.D. Olanow W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Nair V.D. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47053-47061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After prehybridization in 5× SSC, 50% formamide, and 1 mg/ml tRNA at room temperature for 30 min, the denatured probe was added to the prehybridization buffer. Hybridization was carried out for 2 h at52 °C. After two 5-min washes in 5× SSC, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and twice in 2× SSC, the nuclei were stained with DAPI, and slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium. When immunostaining was carried out after FISH, the slides were incubated with respective antibodies as described above. RNA Interference—Custom SMARTpool plus small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target rat p53 (GenBank™ accession number NM_030989) was designed and synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). siRNA (50 pmol) was transfected into PC-12-D2R cells using transit-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) as described previously (32Nair V.D. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47053-47061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After 48 h of transfection, cells were treated with H2O2 (200 μm) or vehicle for 1 h, and total RNA or cell extract was prepared. A nonspecific RNA duplex (Dharmacon) was used in control experiments. ERK and p53 Pathways Are Activated in Response to Oxidative Stress—PC-12-D2R cells and substantia nigra dopaminergic SN4741 cells undergo apoptosis when exposed to H2O2 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (31Nair V.D. Olanow W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 38Chun H.S. Gibson G.E. DeGiorgio L.A. Zhang H. Kidd V.J. Son J.H. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress is known to activate multiple signal transduction pathways in many experimental systems (12Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (7300) Google Scholar). To identify the signaling mechanisms activated by PC-12-D2R cells in response to H2O2, we have assessed the activation of ERK, JNK, p38-kinase, and p53, using Western blot analysis with antisera against phospho-ERK, phospho-JNK, phospho-p38 kinase, and phospho-p53. We found that 200 μm H2O2 rapidly induced the phosphorylation of ERK but not of JNK or p38 kinases in PC-12-D2R cells (Fig. 1A, B, and C). The activation of ERK by H2O2 was rapid and sustained (Fig. 1A, top). Anti-phospho-Ser15 antibody was used to detect oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of p53, presumably caused by DNA damage (39Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3205-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) after exposure to H2O2 for periods up to 6 h. In PC-12-D2R cells, p53 phosphorylation was significantly enhanced within 30 min after H2O2 exposure and continued to increase for up to 2 h (Fig. 1D). The level of total p53 protein on Western blot analysis was unchanged after 6 h of incubation with H2O2 (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate the early activation of ERK and p53 signaling pathways in response to oxidative stress in PC-12-D2R cells. Characterization of ERK-activated Gene Program in Response to Oxidative Stress—ROS, through its effects on cell signaling, alters the expression of specific genes (42Allen R.G. Tresini M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 463-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). To identify the genomic response during oxidative stress, the gene expression profile associated with H2O2 exposure was studied using oligonucleotide microarrays and regulated transcripts were confirmed by qPCR. As shown in Table I, genes that encode transcription factors including egr1, c-fos, c-jun, pc3, and a zinc finger protein (copeb) were up-regulated after 200 μm H2O2 for 1 h. Other up-regulated genes include inner mitochondrial membrane component ATP synthase subunit c, stress response gene 70-kDa heat shock protein (hsp70), and the immediate-early inducible small GTP binding protein rhoB. We also found that the mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (mkp1) was increased by >3-fold in cells treated with H2O2. Several immediate early genes, such as egr1, c-fos, and c-jun, have been reported to be transcriptionally activated by increased cellular oxidation (16Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q.

Changes in the expression level of H2O2-induced genes in Affymetrix analysis (n = 4) were independently confirmed using qPCR analysis of RNA from control and H2O2-treated cells. The qPCR results are presented as -fold increase over control values using the 2 CT formula as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data presented are mean ± S.E. of one experiment repeated three times with essentially the same results.IdentifierGene descriptionFold changeMicroarrayqPCRAF023087Nerve growth factor induced factor A (egr1)5.66 ± 1.7325.01 ± 1.12M18416egr14.25 ± 2.18U75397egr13.78 ± 6.23S81478Oxidative stress-inducible protein tyrosine phosphatase (mkp1)4.12 ± 5.955.47 ± 1.12AA945867c-jun4.12 ± 3.201.93 ± 0.30AI175959c-jun2.58 ± 0.58M60921NGF-inducible anti-proliferative putative secreted protein (pc3)3.32 ± 3.705.50 ± 0.70M60921pc31.63 ± 0.26AA944156pc31.58 ± 0.40AF001417Core promoter element binding protein (copeb)2.76 ± 1.992.18 ± 0.50AI639167Expressed sequence tag2.33 ± 1.411.76 ± 0.42D13123P1 mRNA for ATP synthase subunit c1.97 ± 0.541.70 ± 0.50X06769c-fos1.92 ± 0.412.00 ± 0.70AA900505RhoB1.83 ± 0.191.78 ± 0.60L16764Heat shock protein 70 (hsp70)1.60 ± 0.411.45 ± 0.50 Open table in a new tab To identify the component of the oxidative stress-induced gene program downstream of ERK activation, we inhibited ERK with PD98059. Addition of PD98059 (100 μm) 1 h before H2O2 treatment decreased the induction of egr1, pc3, and mkp1 (Fig. 2), genes that have been identified as downstream of ERK in other experimental systems (46Harada T.

PD98059 did not prevent the induction of c-fos, copeb, c-jun, hsp70, rhoB, ATP synthase subunit c, and expressed sequence tag (GenBank™ accession number AI639167). Characterization of egr1 Induction in Response to Oxidative Stress—To investigate the cellular segregation of the diverse responses to oxidative stress, we next studied the induction of egr1 mRNA using FISH. We exposed cells to 200 μm H2O2, a concentration that induces apoptosis in approximately half of the cells (31Nair V.D. Olanow W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). When cells were exposed to 200 μm H2O2, we observed that approximately half of the cells had strong fluorescent signals (Fig. 3). The signal in the subset of cells not showing egr1 induction at this concentration of H2O2 was indistinguishable from that of control cells. Cells hybridized with sense-oriented probe for egr1 showed no fluorescent signal in any cells (data not shown). Simultaneous double-FISH for egr1 and β-actin mRNA showed no change in β-actin mRNA expression during H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3). These data demonstrate that H2O2 induces a high level of egr1 induction in a subset of cells and no detectable change in egr1 levels in others. ERK-mediated egr1 Induction and p53 Activation Were Present in Discrete Subsets of Cellular Populations—In many experimental systems, signaling through ERK is known to be prosurvival (16Guyton K.Z.

https://openalex.org/W2034909046,"The proto-oncogene c-myc encodes a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The signaling mechanism of c-Myc-induced apoptosis was investigated on the human hepatoma Huh7 cells under growth factor-deprived conditions. The apoptotic process did not involve p53. Rather it was dependent on the expression of c-Fos. Activation of caspases 3 and 9 and down-regulation of Bcl2 were observed in the apoptotic process, indicating it to be a mitochondria-dependent event. An increase in the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase that was mediated by a Rac1-dependent and cdc42-independent pathway eventually leading to up-regulation of c-Fos activity was also observed. Deletion analysis of the promoter region of the c-fos gene indicated that the ATF2-responsive element conferred the Myc-induced expression of c-Fos. Co-expression of the dominant-negative mutants of c-Fos, p38, and Rac1 blocked the Myc-mediated apoptosis. SB20358, a chemical inhibitor of p38 pathway, also specifically blocked the apoptotic signaling by c-Myc. Furthermore, co-expression of the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) along with Myc abrogated the apoptotic signals. The HBx expression was associated with an increase in the levels of phosphorylated AKT and down-regulation of c-Fos by Myc. Thus, c-Fos seems be a new mediator of c-Myc-induced apoptosis. The proto-oncogene c-myc encodes a transcription factor that plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The signaling mechanism of c-Myc-induced apoptosis was investigated on the human hepatoma Huh7 cells under growth factor-deprived conditions. The apoptotic process did not involve p53. Rather it was dependent on the expression of c-Fos. Activation of caspases 3 and 9 and down-regulation of Bcl2 were observed in the apoptotic process, indicating it to be a mitochondria-dependent event. An increase in the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase that was mediated by a Rac1-dependent and cdc42-independent pathway eventually leading to up-regulation of c-Fos activity was also observed. Deletion analysis of the promoter region of the c-fos gene indicated that the ATF2-responsive element conferred the Myc-induced expression of c-Fos. Co-expression of the dominant-negative mutants of c-Fos, p38, and Rac1 blocked the Myc-mediated apoptosis. SB20358, a chemical inhibitor of p38 pathway, also specifically blocked the apoptotic signaling by c-Myc. Furthermore, co-expression of the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) along with Myc abrogated the apoptotic signals. The HBx expression was associated with an increase in the levels of phosphorylated AKT and down-regulation of c-Fos by Myc. Thus, c-Fos seems be a new mediator of c-Myc-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2054149720,"Sphingolipids are important signaling molecules in many biologic processes, but little is known about their organelle-specific roles. Using HeLa cells, we investigated the effects of UV and etoposide-induced apoptosis on the contents of sphingomyelin (SM) and ceramide in subcellular compartments. UV irradiation of HeLa cells increased the levels of SM in all subcellular fractions, but the change was most dramatic in mitochondria. Using diacylglycerol kinase assays to quantify ceramide, we found that the levels of ceramide in mitochondria increased as early as 2 h after UV irradiation and remained elevated at 6 h. The increase in mitochondrial SM and ceramide was inhibited by D609, an inhibitor of sphingomyelinase and SM synthase. The inhibition of sphingolipid production correlated with protection of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and prevention of cytochrome c release following UV irradiation. In contrast, myriocin, an inhibitor of the de novo ceramide synthesis pathway, only partially suppressed the production of ceramides in mitochondria and cannot suppress UV-induced apoptosis. Fumonicin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, can only prevent mitochondrial ceramide synthesis and UV-induced apoptosis in a small degree. These results indicate that mitochondrial ceramide production in UV-irradiated HeLa cells is not mediated by the de novo synthesis pathway, but mainly through SM hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2082044237,"The activity of the transactivation functions (activation function (AF)-1 and AF-2) of the estrogen receptor α (ERα) is cell-specific. This study aimed to decipher the yet unclear mechanisms involved in this differential cell sensitivity, with particular attention to the specific influence that cell differentiation may have on these processes. Hence, we comparatively evaluated the permissiveness of cells to either ERα AFs in two different cases: (i) a series of cell lines originating from a common tissue, but with distinct differentiation phenotypes; and (ii) cell lines that undergo differentiation processes in culture. These experiments demonstrate that the respective contribution that AF-1 and AF-2 make toward ERα activity varies in a cell differentiation stage-dependent manner. Specifically, whereas AF-1 is the dominant AF involved in ERα transcriptional activity in differentiated cells, the more a cell is de-differentiated the more this cell mediates ERα signaling through AF-2. For instance, AF-2 is the only active AF in cells that have achieved their epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, the stable expression of a functional ERα in strictly AF-2 permissive cells restores an AF-1-sensitive cell context. These results, together with data obtained in different ERα-positive cell lines tested strongly suggest that the transcriptional activity of ERα relies on its AF-1 in most estrogen target cell types.

A wide range of physiological processes, including female reproductive function, are controlled by 17β-estradiol (1Nilsson S. Makela S. Treuter E. Tujague M. Thomsen J. Andersson G. Enmark E.

ERα has a critical role in the control of the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation and is therefore intimately associated with the biology of endometrium and breast cancers (3Jordan V.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 36: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The biological effects of ERα often result from modifications in the pattern of expression of specific target genes. These transcriptional regulations are achieved through recruitment of ERα to the promoter region of the target gene, either directly through interaction with cognate DNA sequences (ERE or estrogen responsive elements), or through protein/protein interaction with other transcriptional factors (4Evans R.M.

Science. 1997; 277: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar).ERα is a ligand-inducible transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor (NR) subfamily whose members include steroid, thyroid hormone, retinoic acid, and orphan receptors. Based on structural and functional similarities, the sequences of NRs were divided into six functional domains designated A to F (4Evans R.M.

The central well conserved cysteine-rich C domain constitutes the signature of the NR superfamily, and mediates DNA binding. Hormone lodges into a hydrophobic pocket located within the C-terminal E/F domains that constitute the ligand binding domain. Ligand-induced transcription involves the action of distinct transactivation functions (AFs), located in the N-terminal A/B (AF-1) and the C-terminal E/F (AF-2) domains (7Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar).The respective contribution that these AFs make toward the activity of the full-length ERα is both promoter- and cell-specific (7Tora L.

For instance, a maximal transcriptional activity of ERα can require both AFs in some cells, but only a specific one in others. This suggests that ERα does not interact with the transcriptional machinery in an identical manner in all cells. Functional and physical links between ERα and the transcriptional machinery involves the sequential recruitment by ERα of a group of proteins, called coactivators, on the target promoter, on which they build large protein complexes (11McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar, 12Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Structurally, these recruitments occur after ligand binding has induced specific conformational changes within the protein. So far, two classes of NR coactivator complexes, directly interacting with AF-2 in a ligand-dependent manner, have been identified. The first is formed by CBP/p300, the p160 nuclear receptor coactivator family (SRC-1/TIF2/AIB1), an RNA coactivator (SRA), and probably other unknown components (11McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W.

Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This complex allows a strong decondensation of the chromatin, mainly because of the histone acetyltransferase activity of several of its components (13Bannister J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1523) Google Scholar, 14Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A. McKenna N.J. Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Nature. 1997; 389: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). The second coactivator complex includes proteins of the SMCC/TRAP/DRIP/ARC/Mediator class, and allows the physical link between ERα and the general transcription apparatus, facilitating the activation of polymerase II (12Hermanson O. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 55-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).A cell-type specific activity of both AFs was suggested to result from a specific expression of distinct coactivators. However, the majority of the coactivators are widely expressed in a similar amount in most cells (15McDonnell D.P. Norris J.D. Science. 2002; 296: 1642-1644Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 16Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 45-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several of the coactivators primarily identified as AF-2 specific have now been shown to also interact with the N-terminal region of ERα and to mediate AF-1 activity (17Webb P. Nguyen P.

Therefore, although considerable advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms allowing the receptor to modulate the transcription of a target gene, no clear scheme is emerging with regard to the differential sensitivity of cell types to AF-1 and AF-2.In the present study, we demonstrate that the relative contribution exerted by AF-1 and AF-2 on the transcriptional activity of ERα varies in a cell differentiation stage-dependent manner. Precisely, we show that the more a cell is differentiated, the more this cell mediates ERα signaling through its AF-1. In contrast, AF-2 becomes the dominant AF involved in the transcriptional activity of ERα in undifferentiated or de-differentiated cells. These results, together with data obtained in different ERα-positive cell lines strongly suggest that the transcriptional activity of ERα relies on its AF-1 in most estrogen target cell types.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—The expression vectors used in this study were pSG5, pSG human (h)ERα (HEO), pSG hERα CF (21Green S.

Four luciferase reporter plasmids with different estrogen-sensitive promoters were employed in the transfection experiments: an artificial promoter containing one ERE upstream of the TK promoter (ERE-TK-LUC) (22Flouriot G. Brand H. Denger S. Métivier R. Kos M. Reid G. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4688-4700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the promoter of the human complement C3 (C3-LUC) (23Métivier R. Penot G. Flouriot G. Pakdel F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1953-1970PubMed Google Scholar), the rainbow trout estrogen receptor promoter (rtER-LUC) (24Lazennec G. Kern L. Valotaire Y. Salbert G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5053-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the chicken vitellogenin promoter (cVg-LUC) (25Griffin C. Flouriot G. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1571-1587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cell Culture—All cell lines (HeLa, HepG2, MCF7, T47D, BT20, MDA-MB 231, LNCaP, PC3, DU 145, TSU PR1, P19, Ishikawa, and αT3) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin (25 μg/ml) (Sigma) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The MDA-MB 231 cell line stably transfected with a hERα expression vector (26Reid G. Hubner M.R. Métivier R. Brand H. Denger S. Manu D. Beaudouin J. Ellenberg J. Gannon F. Mol.

The differentiation of the pluripotent stem cell line P19 into neurons and glial cells was achieved by treating P19 aggregates with retinoic acid (1 μm) during 48 h (27Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Rudnicki M.A. Harris J.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2271-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar).Transient Transfection Experiments—Cell lines were transfected with FuGENE™ 6 as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). One day before transfection, cells were plated in 24- or 6-well plates at a density previously determined as giving the best transfection efficiency. One hour prior to transfection, the medium was replaced with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 2.5% charcoal-stripped calf serum. Transfection was carried out with 250 ng of total DNA per well for the 24-well plates or with 1 μg of total DNA for the 6-well plates. Total DNA was composed by the expression vector (50 ng for the 24-wells plate or 200 ng for the 6-well plates), the reporter gene (100 or 400 ng, respectively), and the CMV-β-galactosidase internal control (100 or 400 ng, respectively). Following an overnight incubation with the transfection mixture, the cells were treated with 10 nm estradiol (E2), 2 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), or ethanol (control). After 36 h of transient transfection, cells were harvested and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as previously described (23Métivier R. Penot G. Flouriot G. Pakdel F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1953-1970PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter gene activity was obtained after normalization of the luciferase activity with the β-galactosidase activity.Western Blot Analysis—The expression of estrogen receptor, E-cadherin, vimentin, Tau, as well as actin, was examined by Western blot analysis. Subconfluent cells from 10-cm diameter dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0,1% SDS) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). Following sonication and quantification, 20 μg of these whole cell extracts were denatured in Laemmli buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk powder, during 1.5 h at room temperature. The blots were then incubated with either the polyclonal anti-hERα HC20 (1:1000, TEBU), the monoclonal anti-E-cadherin SHE78-7 (1:1000, Zymed Laboratories), the polyclonal anti-vimentin C-20 (1:500, TEBU), the polyclonal anti-Tau C-17 (1:500, TEBU), or the monoclonal anti-β-actin AC-15 (1:5000, Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk powder for 1.5 h at room temperature. After three washings with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:5000, Pierce), peroxidase-conjugated horse anti-goat (1:5000, TEBU), or peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:5000, Pierce) for 1 h. Membrane-bound secondary antibodies were detected using the SuperSignal West Dura kit from Pierce according to the manufacturer's instructions.RESULTSDistinct Sensitivities of HepG2 and HeLa Cell Lines to ERα AF-1 and AF-2: A Result from Their Divergent Phenotype?—Both ERα AF-1 and AF-2 have been shown to exert their transcriptional activity in a cell-specific manner. Accordingly, cell contexts can be defined as AF-1 or AF-2 permissive, depending upon which AF is principally involved in ERα activity: cell lines can be either equally or exclusively sensitive to either AFs (7Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 8Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P.

McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Selection of an adequate cell line is therefore of primary importance when studying a specific AF of ERs. For instance, the hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 is frequently used to measure the AF-1 activity, whereas AF-2 function is mainly studied in HeLa cells that derive from a cervix carcinoma.We first hypothesized that a distinct cell phenotype may explain the so far misunderstood cell preference for one given AF. Indeed, HeLa and HepG2 cells exhibit very distinct growth rates and phenotypes, despite their common epithelial origin. The cell proliferation rate of HeLa cells is in fact ∼15-fold higher than for HepG2 cells, as demonstrated by a kinetic cell counting (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, contrasting to HeLa cells that exhibit a poorly differentiated phenotype associated with an elongated morphology and little cell-cell interactions, HepG2 cells appear more differentiated, establishing many cell contacts (data not shown). These observations are corroborated by the fact that HeLa cells do not express E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule considered as a marker for epithelial differentiation (29Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar), as assessed by Western blot using HeLa whole cell protein extracts (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, HeLa cells express vimentin, an intermediate filament protein whose expression is associated with increased invasive and metastatic potency (30Thompson E.W. Paik S. Brunner N. Sommers C.L. Zugmaier G. Clarke R. Shima T.B. Torri J. Donahue S. Lippman M.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 534-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). This is in sharp contrast to HepG2 cells that produce a high level of E-cadherin but no vimentin (Fig. 1B).These results suggest a correlation between the distinct permissiveness of HepG2 and HeLa cells to either ERα AF-1 or AF-2 and the divergent phenotype of these cells. However, the different tissue origins of these cell lines may also account for the observed differences. We thus decided to verify whether the cell-dependent involvement of AF-1 or AF-2 in ERα activity is associated with the differentiation stage of cells from a similar tissue origin. However, this study was subordinated to the development of adequate test systems to define the relative cell sensitivity to either ERα transactivation functions.Design of Accurate Test Systems to Probe Distinct Cell Sensitivity to ERα AF-1 and AF-2—Two different approaches were selected to define the relative sensitivity of a cell line to AF-1 and AF-2. In the first system, cell contexts were evaluated in transient transfection experiments by comparing the transcriptional activity of full-length ERα with that of an ERα deleted from the A/B domain (ERα CF) and thus devoid of AF-1 activity. A similar activity of both receptors would define a strict AF-2 permissive cell context, whereas an AF-1 permissive cell context would be inferred from the observation of a transcriptional activity of full-length ERα but not ERα CF. The respective involvement of the AFs of ERα is also promoter-specific (7Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 8Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 9Tzukerman M.T. Esty A. Santiso-Mere D. Danielian P. Parker M.G. Stein R.B. Pike J.W. McDonnell D.P. Mol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9535-9542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, the assessment of the permissiveness of different cell lines for AF-1 or AF-2 required the design of a reporter system having no intrinsic preference for a specific AF and whose response would therefore only reflect cellular variations in the relative contribution that both AF-1 and AF-2 make toward ERα transcriptional activity. From the different estrogen-sensitive promoters tested, a synthetic ERE-TK promoter and the promoters from the complement 3 (C3), rtERα, and cVg genes, the ERE-TK promoter only gave the expected responses (Fig. 2A). Indeed, on this promoter, whereas full-length and truncated ERα exhibit the same activity in the strictly AF-2 permissive HeLa cells, the truncated form is inactive in strictly AF-1 permissive HepG2 cells. Although to a lesser extent, the C3 promoter was also permissive to both AFs. Finally, as the ERα CF was transcriptionally inactive on the rtER and cVg promoters in both HeLa and HepG2 cell lines, these two promoters did not fulfill the criteria of selection for a promoter adequate to our aims. Western blots controlled similar expression of both full-length ERα and ERα CF proteins in the tested cells (Fig. 2B), confirming the relevance of the results. The ERE-TK promoter was therefore selected as a reporter system to probe the distinct cell sensitivity of the ERα AF-1 and AF-2.Fig. 2Design of accurate experimental approaches to define cell sensitivity to ERα AF-1 and AF-2.A, to select estrogen responsive systems assessing cell permissiveness to either ERα AF, we transiently transfected into AF-1 (HepG2) and AF-2 permissive (HeLa) cells several promoter constructs (100 ng of ERE-TK-LUC, 100 ng of C3-LUC, 400 ng of rtER-LUC, or 400 ng of cVg-LUC) together with 50 ng of the expression vectors pSG5, pSG hERα, or pSG hERα CF. 100 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase was used as internal control. Cells were treated for 36 h with 10 nm E2 or with ethanol (EtOH) (control). Quantified luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were normalized, and the values standardized to the reporter activity measured in the presence of pSG hERα without E2. B, Western blot analysis controlling the correct and similar expression of ERα and ERα CF in HeLa and HepG2 cells transiently transfected with the corresponding expression vectors. C, identification of cell sensitivity to either AFs through the ability of ERα CF to repress the AF-1 activity of the full-length ERα. HeLa and HepG2 cells were cotransfected with 100 ng of ERE-TK-LUC together with 50 ng (+) of pSG5, 200 ng (++) of pSG hERα CF, or 50 ng (+) of pSG hERα alone or with increasing amounts of pSG hERα CF (50 ng (+) and 200 ng (++)). 100 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase was used as internal control. Results are expressed as the percentage of the reporter gene activity measured in the presence of pSG hERα and E2. D, use of the agonistic activity of the 4-OHT to characterize cell permissiveness to AF-1. HeLa and HepG2 cells were cotransfected with 200 ng of C3-LUC, 100 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase, and 50 ng of pSG hERα. Cells were treated 36 h with EtOH (control), 10 nm E2, or 2 μm 4-OHT.

Alternatively, the relative sensitivity of ERα positive cell lines to either AFs can be characterized through the ability of the ERα CF to repress the transcriptional activity of full-length ERα in cell contexts sensitive to AF-1 only (22Flouriot G. Brand H. Denger S. Métivier R. Kos M. Reid G. Sonntag-Buck V. Gannon F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4688-4700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2C, whereas an increased expression of ERα CF does not impact ERα transcriptional activity in HeLa cells, ERα CF becomes a potent inhibitor of the full-length form in HepG2 cells. This variant of the first approach was therefore used to estimate the sensitivity of ERα positive cell lines for either AFs.The second system, designed to confirm the relative sensitivity of a cell line to ERα AFs, relies on the partial estrogen agonistic activity of 4-OHT. Actually, the estrogenic activity of 4-OHT exclusively depends upon the AF-1 of ERα, and is therefore observed only in cells sensitive to this AF (8Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments carried out with the human complement C3 promoter, a well characterized 4-OHT-responsive promoter (31Norris J.D. Fan D. Wagner B.L. McDonnell D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1605-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), confirmed that this molecule induces the reporter gene activity via the AF-1 of ERα only. Indeed, an OHT-induced response of the C3 promoter was observed in AF-1 permissive HepG2 cells but not in AF-2 permissive HeLa cells (Fig. 2D). We therefore used this test to further substantiate the AF-1 sensitivity of cells assayed by the first approach.Correlation between the Relative Activity of ERα AFs and the Differentiation Status of Cell Lines Deriving from a Common Tissue—To verify whether the differentiation status of a given cell line influences the respective activity of both ERα transactivation functions, four breast cancer cell lines exhibiting distinct differentiation phenotypes were tested for their ability to mediate ERα transactivation through AF-1 or AF-2. According to the literature, the selected cell lines can be classified from a more to a less differentiated phenotype as follows: MCF7, T47D, BT20, and MDA-MB 231 (30Thompson E.W. Paik S. Brunner N.

We first wished to confirm these data by probing through Western blots the expression levels of two differentiation markers (ERα and E-cadherin), and one invasive and metastatic marker (vimentin) in these cells. Results of these experiments (Fig. 3A) confirm that MDA-MB 231 cells (ERα and E-cadherin negative; vimentin positive) and to a lesser extend BT20 cells (E-cadherin positive; ERα and vimentin negative) are less differentiated than MCF7 or T47D cells (ERα and E-cadherin positive; vimentin negative). Importantly, MCF7 and T47D cells are ERα positive, in contrast to BT20 and MDA-MB 231 cells.Fig. 3Correlation between the relative activity of ERα AFs and the differentiation status of MCF7, T47D, BT20, and MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cell lines.A, Western blot analysis probing the expression of endogenous ERα, E-cadherin, vimentin, and β-actin in the four indicated cell lines. B, the permissiveness of MCF7 and T47D ERα positive cell lines to either ERα AFs was assessed using the dominant negative property of ERα CF in AF-1-sensitive cells. Cells were transfected with 100 ng of ERE-TK-LUC together with 50 ng of pSG5 or pSG hERα in the absence or presence of 200 ng of hERα CF. In the ERα negative BT20 and MDA-MB 231 cell lines, the direct comparison of ERα and ERα CF transcriptional activities evaluated the sensitivity of these cells to either AFs. Cells were transfected using 100 ng of ERE-TK-LUC with 50 ng of pSG5, pSG hERα, or pSG hERα CF. In both ERα positive and negative cell lines, 100 ng of CMV-β-galactosidase was used as internal control. Cells were treated for 36 h with 10 nm E2 or with EtOH vehicle (control). Luciferase activities were normalized by β-galactosidase values, and the results are figured as the percentage of the reporter gene activity measured in the presence of pSG hERα and E2. C, agoni"
https://openalex.org/W2014255348,"Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) can block apoptosis through binding to active caspases and antagonizing their function. IAP function can be neutralized by Smac/Diablo, an IAP-binding protein that is released from mitochondria during apoptosis. In addition to their ability to interact with caspases, certain IAPs also display ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity because of the presence of a RING domain. However, it is not known whether the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activities of human IAPs contribute to their apoptosis inhibitory activity or whether this IAP property can be modulated through association with Smac/Diablo. Here we demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase activities of XIAP, and to a lesser extent c-IAP-1 and c-IAP2, are potently repressed through binding to Smac/Diablo. We also show that mutation of the XIAP RING domain rendered this IAP a less effective inhibitor of apoptosis, suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase activity of XIAP contributes to its anti-apoptotic function. These data suggest that Smac/Diablo potentiates apoptosis by simultaneously antagonizing caspase-IAP interactions and repressing IAP ubiquitin ligase activities.

The caspase family of cysteine proteases plays a pivotal role in apoptosis through coordinating the ultrastructural alterations that take place within the cell during this process (1Earnshaw W.C.

In common with other proteins that possess the RING motif, XIAP and c-IAP1 have been shown to be capable of acting as ubiquitin ligases in reactions that culminate in the transfer of ubiquitin to the IAPs themselves, or molecules that associate with these proteins (7Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 8Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol.

However, although there is good evidence that XIAP and c-IAP1 can function as ubiquitin ligases, it is not clear whether this activity contributes to the ability of these proteins to regulate apoptosis. Studies in Drosophila have shown that DIAP1 plays a critical role in regulating the onset of apoptosis in this organism (10Hay B.A. Wassarmann D.A. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 11Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The Drosophila IAP-binding proteins, Reaper (Rpr), Hid, and Grim (collectively called the RHG proteins), are important triggers of programmed cell death in the fly (13White K. Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Young L. Farrell K. Steller H. Science. 1994; 264: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the Drosophila RHG proteins promote apoptosis through their ability to interact with and neutralize DIAP1 function (11Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 12Goyal L. McCall K. Agapite J. Hartwieg E. Steller H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Although Rpr, Hid, and Grim appear to achieve this in subtly distinct ways, one way in which they can neutralize DIAP1 function is through promoting the ubiquitin ligase activities of this IAP (14Martin S.J. Cell. 2002; 9: 1031-1042Google Scholar). In this regard, several groups have shown recently that Rpr can provoke the destruction of DIAP1 through stimulation of DIAP1 auto-ubiquitination (15Hays R. Wickline L. Cagan R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A. Kornbluth S. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Polyubiquitination of DIAP1 targets this protein to the proteasome, which rapidly degrades polyubiquitinated proteins into short peptides. These observations raise the interesting possibility that mammalian IAP stability may also be regulated through association with functional homologues of the RHG proteins, Smac/Diablo or Omi/Htra2. Here we have used in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assays to explore whether the ubiquitin ligase activity of XIAP is modulated through association with Smac/Diablo. We show that Smac/Diablo can act as a potent repressor of the ubiquitin ligase activities of the mammalian IAPs; XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2. Smac/Diablo antagonized both XIAP auto-ubiquitination as well as XIAP-dependent ubiquitination of caspase-7. We also report that XIAP mutants lacking RING domain function were significantly less effective at inhibiting apoptosis than wild type XIAP, suggesting that the ubiquitin ligase activity of this IAP contributes to its anti-apoptotic function. Therefore, we propose that Smac/DIABLO lowers the threshold for apoptosis by binding to IAPs and repressing the intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activities of these proteins. Plasmid Constructs and Antibodies—Constructs encoding XIAP and c-IAP1 in pEBB and pEBG vectors have been described previously (20Duckett C.S. Li F. Wang Y. Tomaselli K.J. Thompson C.B. Armstrong R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). pEBB and pEBG-based c-IAP2 constructs were generated by inserting the c-IAP2 coding sequence into the BamHI and NotI sites of the pEBB and pEBG vectors as described for c-IAP1 and XIAP (20Duckett C.S. Li F. Wang Y. Tomaselli K.J. Thompson C.B. Armstrong R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 608-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Myc-pcDNA3.XIAPK322/328R was kindly provided by Dr. Guy S. Salvesen (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). The cysteine residues 450 and 453 of the XIAP RING domain were mutated to serine using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers, followed by ligation into pcDNA3.myc: XIAPC450/453SF, GAGGAGAAGCTTTCCAAAATCTCTATGGATAGAAATATTGC; XIAPC450/453SR, GCAATATTTCTATCCATAGAGATTTTGGAAAGCTTCTCCTC. Smac and Smacδ isoforms were cloned using standard reverse transcriptase-PCR techniques from total RNA extracted from Jurkat cells. The following primers were used to amplify both Smac isoforms: SmacF, ATGGCGGCTCTGAAGAGTTGG; SmacR, TCAATCCTCACGCAGGTAGGC. PCR products were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by using the above primers incorporating specific restriction enzyme sites and the FLAG epitope tag sequence. Plasmid constructs were verified by using standard automated sequencing methods (MWG Biotec). The His6-ubiquitin plasmid, pCW7, was a kind gift from Dr. Ron Kopito (Stanford University). The Smacβ plasmid pcDNA6.1Smacβ was a kind gift from Dr. Marion MacFarlane (MRC Toxicology Unit, Leicester, UK). Anti-XIAP, anti-GST, and anti-caspase-7 antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Anti-polyubiquitin antibody was purchased from Affiniti Research Products; anti-c-IAP2 polyclonal antibody was from R&D Systems; anti-actin mAb was from ICN. The generation and affinity purification of anti-Smac rabbit polyclonal antibody have been described previously (21Adrain C. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6627-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and a similar strategy was used to generate c-IAP1 antisera. Briefly, an N-terminal truncated form of c-IAP1 (amino acids 351–618) containing the CARD and RING domains was cloned into pET15b. Recombinant c-IAP1-(351–618) was expressed in Escherichia coli (BL-21/DE3/pLysS strain) and purified over Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, followed by immunization of rabbits with the purified protein. Cell Death Assays—Cell death assays were carried out by co-transfection of plasmids along with pCMVβ or pEGFP reporter plasmids (50 ng/well in 6-well plates). After exposure to pro-apoptotic stimuli, cells were fixed and then stained for β-galactosidase activity (where the reporter pCMVβ was used), as described previously (22Adrain C. Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20855-20860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Alternatively, where pEGFP reporter plasmid was used, cells were fixed and examined under a UV microscope for EGFP-associated fluorescence. Blue or green (transfected) cells were then scored as either apoptotic or viable according to standard morphological criteria. Apoptotic cells were typically retracted from the substratum, shrunk, and exhibited dramatic membrane blebbing along with the formation of numerous apoptotic bodies. A minimum of 300 transfected cells per treatment was evaluated. Transient Transfections and Immunoprecipitation Assays— HEK293T cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/10-cm plate (or 105/well of a 6-well tissue culture plate) 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with plasmids according to the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method, and DNA complexes were typically allowed to remain on cells for 6 h before replacing with fresh medium. Where indicated, the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Affiniti Research Products), was included in the medium to stabilize polyubiquitinated proteins. Following transfection, cells were lysed in 800 μl of triple detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% sodium azide) containing 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. Following centrifugation, clarified lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using 1 μg of the appropriate antibody and 30 μl of agarose-coupled protein A/G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For GST-pulldown assays, lysates were incubated with 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were rotated at 4 °C for 4 h, and complexes were washed three to four times in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by immunoblotting by using appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Alternatively, for precipitation of His6-tagged proteins, cells were lysed in triple detergent lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. Lysates were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 40 μl of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), followed by washing three times in lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mm imidazole to reduce nonspecific binding. Captured proteins were subsequently eluted from the resin by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For transfection of HeLa cells, an alternative transfection method was employed. Cells were seeded at 5 × 104/well in 6-well tissue culture plates 24 h prior to transfection. FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was used at a ratio of ∼2 μl/μg input plasmid, and FuGENE-DNA complexes were incubated with cells for 6 h at 37 °C. DNA complexes were then removed, replaced with fresh medium, and incubation continued to 24 h. Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—Cell-free extracts of Jurkat and HEK293 cells were prepared as described previously (23Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicolson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1681) Google Scholar, 24Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7320-7326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 108 cells were packed into a 2-ml Dounce homogenizer, and an equal volume of ice-cold cell extract buffer was added (CEB: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cells were allowed to swell in CEB for 20–30 min on ice and were then lysed by homogenization with ∼20–30 strokes of a B-type pestle. Crude extracts were then centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g to remove nuclei, unbroken cells, and other debris. Extracts were stored in aliquots at –70 °C until required. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay Using Cell-free Extracts—In vitro ubiquitination assays were typically set up in 100-μl reaction volumes. For 100-μl scale reactions, 25 μl of Jurkat cell-free extract (∼30 mg/ml protein) and 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) were supplemented with 10 μg/ml ubiquitin-activating enzyme, 15 μg/ml ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, 250 μg/ml His6-ubiquitin (Affinity, UK), 10 μm lactacystin, 1 mm ATP and were brought to a final volume of 100 μl in CEB. Caspase activation was initiated by addition of 50 μg/ml bovine heart cytochrome c (Sigma, UK) and 1 mm dATP. Samples (10–20 μl) of cell-free reactions were removed at the times indicated in the figure and frozen at –70 °C for subsequent Western blot analysis. IAPs Undergo RING-dependent Auto-ubiquitination in Vivo —Smac/Diablo has been reported to interact with several mammalian IAPs and antagonize their caspase-inhibitory functions (25Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 26Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L.

Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, transient overexpression of Smac/Diablo readily sensitized HeLa cells to several chemotherapeutic drugs over a range of drug concentrations (Fig. 1). However, it remains unclear whether Smac/Diablo functions simply to block interaction between IAPs and caspases or whether this protein can also regulate the Ub ligase activities of the IAPs. To address this question, we used an in vivo ubiquitination assay where polyhistidine-tagged ubiquitin (His-Ub) was co-expressed with XIAP, c-IAP1, or c-IAP2 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. Transient overexpression of these RING-containing proteins along with His-Ub resulted in the formation of high molecular weight Ub conjugates of all three IAPs, as demonstrated by a ladder-like pattern of immunoreactive bands upon Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Titration of either XIAP or His-Ub in this context resulted in a corresponding decrease in XIAP-Ub conjugates, suggesting that XIAP is capable of acting as a Ub ligase toward itself (Fig. 2, A–C). We further confirmed this through use of XIAP deletion mutants lacking the RING domain, as well as a XIAP point mutant lacking an important His residue within the RING domain (29Verhagen A.M. Coulson E.J. Vaux D.L. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-10Crossref Google Scholar, 30Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D.

Both mutants exhibited significantly reduced levels of polyubiquitination when expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2, D and E). These data demonstrate that XIAP is capable of undergoing auto-ubiquitination and that this activity requires an intact RING domain. Similarly, a c-IAP2 deletion mutant lacking the RING domain also exhibited drastically decreased levels of polyubiquitination when co-expressed with His-Ub in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2F).Fig. 2XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2 undergo RING-dependent auto-ubiquitination.A, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with His6-tagged ubiquitin (2 μg) and the indicated HA- or GST-tagged IAP expression plasmids (4 μg). Cell lysates were prepared 24 h post-transfection, and Western blots were probed for XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2, as indicated. The loading control is a nonspecific band that resulted from the c-IAP1 probing. B, HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding His6-ubiquitin (2 μg) along with the indicated amounts of XIAP expression plasmid or empty vector (4 μg). Cell lysates were prepared 24 h post-transfection, and Western blots were probed for XIAP. Nonspecific bands from the XIAP probing serve as a loading control. C, HEK293T cells were transfected with either empty vector (1 μg) or XIAP plasmid (1 μg) together with the indicated amounts of a plasmid encoding His6 -ubiquitin. His6-ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were subsequently precipitated from cell lysates using nickel immobilized on agarose beads (Ni2 -PPT). Bead-immobilized precipitates were then probed for XIAP (upper panel). Cell lysates (5% of input protein) were also probed for XIAP and actin (loading control) as shown. D, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with a panel of HA epitope-tagged XIAP constructs (3 μg of each plasmid) along with His6-ubiquitin (2 μg). Cell lysates were prepared 24 h post-transfection and were subjected to Ni2+ affinity precipitation (Ni2+-PPT), followed by probing for XIAP. Lysates represent 5% of the input used for the Ni2+ affinity precipitations. E, HEK293T cells were transfected either with GST vector or the indicated GST-XIAP fusions, along with His6 -ubiquitin expression plasmid (2 μg). Cell lysates were prepared 24 h post-transfection and were incubated with glutathione-conjugated Sepharose beads followed by probing for ubiquitin.

However, and in direct contrast to what has been reported in the case of the Drosophila RHG proteins, Smac/Diablo potently repressed the formation of XIAP polyubiquitin conjugates, suggesting that this protein can antagonize the E3 ligase activities of XIAP (Fig. 3). We also explored the effects of a Smac/Diablo splice variant, Smacδ (31Roberts D.L. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J.

Smacδ is similar in structure to the wild type Smac isoform except that it lacks amino acids 62–105 that follow the IAP-binding motif (AVPI). Smacδ retains the ability to bind XIAP (Fig. 3F) and was even more effective than full-length Smac/Diablo in terms of its ability to block the formation of XIAP-Ub conjugates (Fig. 3, A–D). Moreover, Smacδ reproducibly sensitized HeLa cells to a range of pro-apoptotic drugs more effectively than full-length Smac (Fig. 3E). This suggests that the ability of Smac to lower the threshold for entry into apoptosis may be correlated with its ability to repress the Ub ligase activity of one or more IAPs. Significantly, both Smac and Smacδ were found to interact with XIAP under the conditions employed in our co-expression assays, providing a direct means to enable Smac to modulate the ubiquitin ligase activities of XIAP (Fig. 3F). However, to confirm that interaction between XIAP and Smac was required for the observed effects on XIAP auto-ubiquitination, we employed the Smacβ isoform that does not interact with XIAP due to the absence of the IAP-binding motif in this splice variant (31Roberts D.L. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We confirmed that Smacβ failed to interact with XIAP (Fig. 4A), as reported previously (31Roberts D.L. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We also explored whether Smacβ could antagonize XIAP auto-ubiquitination. As Fig. 4B illustrates, in sharp contrast to the effects seen with either the wild type Smac or Smacδ isoforms, Smacβ failed to modulate XIAP auto-ubiquitination. The inhibitory effects of Smac/Diablo on XIAP auto-ubiquitination were also observed by using an in vitro ubiquitination assay based upon Jurkat cell-free extracts. As shown in Fig. 5A, spontaneous auto-ubiquitination of XIAP was inhibited by the addition of recombinant His-Smac-(Δ1–55) to the extracts. We also used this system to explore whether the rate of XIAP auto-ubiquitination was altered by triggering caspase activation in the extracts. Caspase activation was initiated by addition of cytochrome c/dATP (which promotes assembly of the Apaf-1/Caspase-9 apoptosome) to the extracts. It has been reported previously (33Devereaux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) that XIAP undergoes caspase-dependent proteolysis during apoptosis, and this was readily observed in the cell-free system (Fig. 5A). XIAP polyubiquitination was also observed under these conditions, and this was once again inhibited through addition of recombinant His-Smac-(Δ1–55) to the extracts (Fig. 5A). Addition of Smac also blocked the appearance of one of the XIAP proteolytic fragments, presumably because Smac binding masked this particular caspase cleavage site in XIAP (Fig. 5A). Significantly, the non-IAP binding Smacβ isoform failed to inhibit XIAP auto-ubiquitination in the same context (Fig. 5B). Smac/Diablo Is a General Inhibitor of IAP Ub Ligase Activity—Notably, we also found Smac/Diablo to have inhibitory effects on the ubiquitin ligase activity of the other RING-containing IAPs, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, in vivo (Fig. 5, C and D). However, the effects of Smac and Smacδ on polyubquitination of c-IAP1 were relatively modest and may reflect a lower affinity of Smac/Diablo for this IAP relative to XIAP. Thus, Smac appears capable of acting as an antagonist of the E3 ligase activities of several IAPs. An alternative interpretation of our observations is that rather than acting as an inhibitor of IAP Ub ligase activities, Smac/Diablo may instead divert these activities away from the IAP and toward IAP-binding proteins, such as Smac/Diablo itself (34MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36611-36616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, we also explored whether Smac/Diablo could be ubiquitinated by XIAP, but we found no evidence for this either in the in vivo HEK293T cell assay (Fig. 3, A and B) or in the Jurkat cell-free ubiquitination assay (data not shown). We then asked whether XIAP could act as a Ub ligase toward any of its caspase binding partners. To address this question, we co-expressed caspase-7 and His-Ub in the presence or absence of XIAP, and we assessed the appearance of high molecular weight forms of caspase-7 under these conditions. Caspase-7 appeared to be weakly polyubiquitinated in vivo in an XIAP-dependent manner (Fig. 6A). Moreover, this was attenuated when caspase-7 was co-expressed with XIAP mutants lacking the RING domain (Fig. 6A). To determine whether Smac/Diablo could enhance or suppress XIAP-mediated poly-ubiquitination of caspase-7, we used two approaches. First, we overexpressed Bax to promote release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo in cells transfected with caspase-7 in the presence or absence of XIAP. We then assessed the formation of caspase-7 conjugates under these conditions. As Fig. 6B illustrates, overexpression of XIAP in this system resulted in an inhibition of caspase-7 activation and enhancement of caspase-7 ubiquitination. Furthermore, we observed a marked decrease in the abundance of caspase-7 conjugates upon Bax overexpression. These observations are consistent with the interpretation that Smac/Diablo also inhibits XIAP-mediated polyubiquitination of caspase-7. In the second approach, we co-transfected caspase-7 and XIAP in the presence or absence of Smac or Smacδ (Fig. 6C). Once again, Bax overexpression was used to promote Smac release from mitochondria. We again observed that XIAP-dependent polyubiquitination of caspase-7 was inhibited by overexpression of Smac or Smacδ. Taken together, these observations suggest that Smac/Diablo acts as a general antagonist of the Ub ligase activities of XIAP toward itself or its binding partners. The XIAP RING Domain Plays a Role in Apoptosis Suppression—The effect of Smac/Diablo on the Ub ligase activities of the IAPs was intriguing and suggested that this IAP function might make an important contribution to the apoptosis inhibitory properties of these proteins. Because the RING domain of XIAP is essential for its E3 ligase activity (Fig. 2, D and E), we compared XIAP and XIAPΔRING in terms of their ability to block daunorubicin- or etoposide-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. These experiments revealed that full-length XIAP was a more potent inhibitor of apoptosis than the XIAPΔRING deletion mutant (Fig. 7). The enhanced protection seen with full-length XIAP does not appear to be due to more efficient expression of this construct as compared with the XIAPΔRING mutant, as both were expressed with equal efficiency in HeLa cells (Fig. 7B). It is important to note that the XIAPΔRING mutant was clearly able to block apoptosis when overexpressed at high levels but that its effects titrated more readily than full-length XIAP. Because deletion of the RING domain of XIAP could have additional effects beyond disruption of the Ub ligase activities of this protein, we also explored the apoptosis inhibitory activity of two additional XIAP mutants (Fig. 8A). Thus, we used a XIAP mutant (XIAPK322R/K328R) that has been reported to be defective in auto-ubiquitination because of mutation of two lysine residues within BIR3 that are sites of ubiquitin attachment (35Shin H. Okada K. Wilkinson J.C. Solomon K.M. Duckett C.S. Reed J.C. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Significantly, although incapable of auto-ubiquitination, this mutant is predicted to retain Ub ligase activity toward other proteins because of its intact RING domain. We also generated an additional XIAP mutant where two of the conserved cysteine residues within the RING consensus motif were mutated to serine (XIAPC450S/C453S; Fig. 8A). As expected, both mutants displayed a marked reduction in autoubiquitination when co-transfected with His-Ub in HEK293T cells (Fig. 8B). These XIAP mutants were expressed with similar efficiency to wild type XIAP (Fig. 8C), enabling their apoptosis inhibitory properties to be directly compared. Consistent with our earlier observations using the XIAPΔRING deletion mutant, the XIAPC/S RING mutant also inhibited apoptosis less effectively than wild type XIAP (Fig. 8, D and E). In contrast, the auto-ubiquitination defective mutant, XIAPK/R, inhibited apoptosis as effectively as wild type XIAP (Fig. 8E). These data suggest that the Ub ligase activity of XIAP toward other proteins (such as caspases), but not toward itself, contributes to its apoptosis inhibitory properties. Here we have shown that Smac/Diablo can antagonize the Ub ligase activities of several IAPs, suggesting that this property may contribute to the ability of Smac/Diablo to potentiate apoptosis. In line with this, we have also shown that Ub ligase-defective XIAP mutants were less effective inhibitors of apoptosis than their wild type counterparts. The latter observation suggests that IAPs may neutralize caspase function through binding to these proteases and targeting them for ubiquitination. Taken together, these data argue that Smac/Diablo lowers the threshold for apoptosis by simultaneously neutralizing the caspase binding and Ub ligase properties of the IAPs. The significance of the RING domain for IAP function has been controversial. Some reports have implicated the RING domain as a negative regulator of IAP function, whereas others have reported it to have a role in the anti-apoptotic function of IAPs (7Yang Y. Fang S.

One reason for the disagreement in the literature may be due to the fact that the differences between full-length IAPs and their RING mutants may be difficult to observe at high levels of overexpression. Recently, several reports (15Hays R. Wickline L. Cagan R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A. Kornbluth S. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) have emerged to suggest that IAP Ub ligase activity plays an important role in regulating the onset of apoptosis in Drosophila. In the fly context, the RING domain of DIAP1 was found to be required for efficient suppression of apoptosis possibly through ubiquitination of the caspase-9 orthologue, DRONC (40Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A. Baker D.A. Agapite J. Steller H. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, upon binding of Rpr to DIAP1, the latter was found to undergo auto-ubiquitination and destruction (15Hays R. Wickline L. Cagan R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A. Kornbluth S. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Loss of DIAP1 results in the spontaneous assembly of complexes between the Apaf-1 orthologue, DARK, and DRONC, leading to cell death (reviewed in Ref. 14Martin S.J. Cell. 2002; 9: 1031-1042Google Scholar). Thus, Rpr appears to divert the Ub ligase activities of DIAP1 away from DRONC and toward itself, thereby facilitating DRONC activation. DIAP1 appears to play a critical role in regulating the onset of cell death in the fly, as loss of this IAP is sufficient to allow apoptosis to proceed (11Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 41Rodriguez A. Chen P. Oliver H. Abrams J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2189-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In contrast, targeted disruption of XIAP appears to have few, if any, deleterious effects in the mouse (42Harlin H. Reffey S.B. Duckett C.S. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3604-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The latter result may be because of functional redundancy between the mammalian IAPs. Alternatively, IAPs may play a less critical role in mammals than in the fly. However, mammalian IAPs do appear to play an important role in setting a threshold for apoptosis because overexpression of Smac/Diablo does indeed lower this threshold (Ref. 43Fulda S. Wick W. Weller M. Debatin K.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). As outlined above, interaction of Drosophila Rpr with DIAP1 is thought to promote apoptosis through triggering auto-ubiquitination of DIAP1. However, in direct contrast to this, we found that Smac/Diablo inhibits rather than promotes autoubiquitination of mammalian IAPs. This discrepancy is puzzling, but it is clear that Rpr and Smac/Diablo are not orthologues; thus it is not surprising that they exhibit differences in their activities. In support of our observations, a recent study by Vaux and co-workers (44Silke J. Kratina T. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Vaux D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4313-4321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) has also shown that Smac/Diablo can antagonize XIAP Ub ligase activity. Our observation that Smac/Diablo inhibits the Ub ligase activities of the mammalian IAPs suggests that IAP-mediated modification of caspases may contribute to their ability to act as caspase inhibitors. Thus, IAP-bound caspases may still pose a threat to the viability of the cell if they subsequently become displaced from the IAP. However, if caspases become modified (via mono- or polyubiquitination) through even transient IAP interaction, this may render the caspase permanently inactive. This scenario would provide an explanation for the decrease in apoptosis inhibitory activity seen with XIAP upon deletion or mutation of the RING domain. It remains unclear how Smac/Diablo suppresses the E3 ligase activities of XIAP. The region within XIAP that has been implicated as the site of attachment of polyubiquitin chains has been mapped recently to residues (Lys-322 and Lys-328) within the BIR3 domain (35Shin H. Okada K. Wilkinson J.C. Solomon K.M. Duckett C.S. Reed J.C. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because Smac can interact with XIAP via the same BIR domain, it is possible that Smac antagonizes auto-ubiquitination by masking these lysine residues on XIAP. However, it remains to be determined how Smac antagonizes the E3 ligase activity of XIAP toward other substrates (such as caspases), but this may be simply be due to the displacement of the caspase from this IAP. Alternatively, once Smac is released from mitochondria, it may complex with XIAP and its substrate to form a ternary complex. A complex of this nature has been demonstrated recently between the linker-BIR2 region of XIAP, caspase-7, and Smac (45Huang Y. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Wu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49517-49522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, under these conditions Smac binds XIAP with a lower affinity than caspase-7, failing to displace it. The ability of Smac to inhibit the ubiquitin ligase activity of XIAP may be important in this scenario, rescuing the caspase from a fate of degradation. In conclusion, we provide evidence to suggest that Smac/Diablo may use a dual mechanism to inhibit IAP-mediated protection from active caspases. By disrupting IAP-caspase interactions and repressing the ubiquitin ligase activities of IAPs, Smac/Diablo may rescue caspases from the fate of ubiquitination. We thank Drs.

I investigated the role of protein kinase C (PKC) ϵ in regulating the transcriptional activation of STAT1α in mesangial cells. IFN-γ increased PKCϵ activity in a time-dependent manner with a concomitant increase in STAT1α transcriptional activity. Expression of constitutively active PKCϵ mimicked the effect of IFN-γ on STAT1α-dependent transcription. Expression of dominant negative PKCϵ inhibited IFN-γ-induced STAT1α-dependent transcription.

IFN-γ elicits its biological effects through heterodimeric receptors 1 and 2, which are constitutively associated with two tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2 (11Aaronson D.S. Horvath C.M. Science. 2002; 296: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Binding of the ligand stimulates conformational changes in the receptor membrane proximal region, which juxtaposes these tyrosine kinases to enable their cross-phosphorylation and activation (11Aaronson D.S.

JAKs then phosphorylate IFN-γ receptor 1 at tyrosine 440, creating a docking site for the downstream Src homology 2 domain containing protein, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1α) (13Kisseleva T.

Immunol. 1997; 15: 563-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). STAT1α, which is recruited to the JAK-receptor complex, is phosphorylated in the C terminus at a conserved tyrosine residue (tyrosine 701). Tyrosinephosphorylated STAT1α then dissociates from the receptor complex and undergoes reciprocal dimerization. The dimer then translocates to the nucleus by the nuclear receptors, importin-α5 and Ran (15O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, STAT1α dimer associates with other transcription factors and transcriptional coactivators to result in binding to cognate DNA sequences and to stimulate transcription of target genes (15O'Shea J.J. Gadina M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 2002; 109: S121-S131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). The kidney glomerulus is a target of diverse pathological processes including immune-modulated diseases such as glomerulonephritis. Mesangial cells constitute one-third of the cell types in the glomerulus and contribute to pathogenesis of many forms of glomerulonephritis (16Mene P. Simonson M.S. Dunn M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 1372-1421Crossref Scopus (461) Google Scholar).

Despite its growth inhibitory effect, however, IFN-γ did not abolish overall extracellular matrix production, which is also part of the disease phenotype (17Johnson R.J. Lombardi D. Eng E. Gordon K.

It has recently been shown that macrophages isolated from protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ) null cells lack the IFN-γ-induced response, indicating a positive regulatory role for PKCϵ in IFN-γ signaling (22Castrillo A. Pennington D.J. Otto F. Parker P.J. Owen M.J. Bosca L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Signal transduction pathways have been extensively studied in IFN-γ-induced transcriptional activation of STAT1α. In addition to JAK1/JAK2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, phosphorylation of STAT1α on a conserved serine residue (serine 727) also plays an important role in STAT1α activity (23Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The specific kinase responsible for phosphorylating STAT1α, however, has not been conclusively identified. Involvement of Erk1/2 (MAPK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase has been reported in an agonist-dependent manner in different cell types and a role for MAPK in IFN-γ-induced STAT1α serine phosphorylation has also been argued (23Decker T. Kovarik P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2628-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). More recently phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt signaling has been shown to regulate STAT1α serine phosphorylation in tumor cells and fibroblasts (24Nguyen H. Ramana C.V. Bayes J. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33361-33368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this report, I examined the mechanism of IFN-γ-induced STAT1α-dependent transcription in mesangial cells. I show that IFN-γ stimulates PKCϵ, which in turn activates STAT1α-mediated transcription. I demonstrate that PI 3-kinase regulates IFN-γ-induced PKCϵ phosphorylation and activity. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase prevents IFN-γ-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1α without any effect on its tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding, resulting in inhibition of STAT1α-dependent transcription. I demonstrate that, IFN-γ-induced MAPK activity is regulated by PI 3-kinase and PKCϵ. Finally, I show that MAPK increases STAT1α transcriptional activity with minimal effect on its DNA binding capability. These results represent the first evidence that IFN-γ stimulates a linear signal transduction pathway in which PI 3-kinase stimulates PKCϵ, which in turn activates MAPK to stimulate transcriptional activation of STAT1α.

Data Analysis—The significance of the data was determined by analysis of variance. IFN-γ Increases Novel PKCϵ Activity in Mesangial Cells—In IFN-γ signaling the nature of the STAT1α kinase is not precisely known. Because macrophages from PKCϵ null mice display an impaired response to IFN-γ (22Castrillo A. Pennington D.J. Otto F. Parker P.J. Owen M.J. Bosca L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and mesangial cells abundantly express this novel PKC isotype (36Huwiler A. Schulze-Lohoff E. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Exp. Nephrol. 1993; 1: 19-25PubMed Google Scholar, 37Whiteside C.I. Dlugosz J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F975-F980Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the effect of IFN-γ on activation of PKCϵ was examined. Lysates of mesangial cells incubated with IFN-γ were immunoprecipitated with PKCϵ-specific antibody followed by the immune complex kinase assay using a peptide substrate. IFN-γ increased PKCϵ activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). It has recently been shown that phosphorylation of a serine residue (Ser-729) in the C-terminal hydrophobic domain of PKCϵ is necessary for the activation of this novel PKC isoform (38Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). To examine this activation in mesangial cells, lysates of cells incubated with IFN-γ were immunoblotted with phospho-PKCϵ antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated serine 729 residue. IFN-γ increased phosphorylation of PKCϵ, indicating activation of this isozyme (Fig. 1B, lane 2). PI 3-Kinase Regulates IFN-γ-induced PKCϵ—Many PKC isoforms including PKCϵ have been shown to be associated with the PI 3-kinase target PDK1 (39Good J. Le A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the serum-induced hydrophobic domain, serine phosphorylation of novel PKCs is sensitive to the pharmacological inhibitor of PI 3-kinase Ly294002 (38Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 39Good J. Le A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of PI 3-kinase in IFN-γ-induced PKCϵ phosphorylation was examined. Ly294002 blocked phosphorylation of PKCϵ resulting in inhibition of its enzymatic activity in response to IFN-γ (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively). These data indicate that IFN-γ increases PKCϵ activity in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. PKCϵ Regulates STAT1α-dependent Transcription—IFN-γ elicits its biological activity through activation of STAT1α (20Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H.

We and others (19Marra F. Ghosh Choudhury G. Abboud H.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1218-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Ghosh Choudhury G. Marra F. Kiyomoto H. Abboud H.E.

Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) have previously used SIE as a STAT1α target DNA sequence. To examine whether there is any effect on the transactivation property of STAT1α, a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid in which four copies of SIE drives the basal promoter activity of SV40 (4xSIE-Luc) was used (Fig. 2A) (42Ghosh Choudhury G. Ricono J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). 4xSIE-Luc was cotransfected into mesangial cells with a plasmid, which expresses constitutively active PKCϵ (cPKCϵ). Expression of cPKCϵ increased the transcription of the reporter gene similar to treatment with IFN-γ (Fig. 2B). However, expression of cPKCϵ in the presence of IFN-γ induced transcriptional activation comparable with that of cPKCϵ alone (Fig. 2B). In IFN-γ-responsive genes, the STAT1α target DNA element is GAS (13Kisseleva T. Bhattacharya S. Braunstein J. Schindler C.W. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 285: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 40Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). To study the role of PKCϵ, the effect of expression of dominant negative PKCϵ on transcriptional activation of a GAS-driven reporter construct in mesangial cells was examined. IFN-γ increased transcription of the reporter gene (Fig. 2C). Expression of dominant negative PKCϵ (DN PKCϵ) significantly inhibited IFN-γ-induced transcription of the reporter gene (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that PKCϵ regulates STAT1α-dependent transcription. PI 3-Kinase Regulates IFN-γ-stimulated STAT1α Transcriptional Activation without Any Effect on DNA Binding and Tyrosine Phosphorylation in Mesangial Cells—Among many putative serine kinases, PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling has recently been shown to regulate serine phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of STAT1α (24Nguyen H.

The number of isoprene units in the tail of Q varies depending on the species; humans, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce Q10, Q9, and Q6, respectively. Q is reversibly reduced (Q hydroquinone) and oxidized (Q) as it transports electrons from complex I or II to the cytochrome bc1 complex in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Q hydroquinone is synthesized in the mitochondria, where it acts not only in respiration but also in fatty acid β-oxidation (2Frerman F.E. Biochem. Soc.

As with all of the coq mutant strains, yeast coq7 mutants cannot produce Q and are therefore respiration-defective, unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (9Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Yeast coq7-null mutants accumulate an early Q biosynthetic intermediate, 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HHB), as do mutants in the complementation groups coq3, coq4, coq5, coq6, and abc1/coq8 (Fig. 1) (11Poon W.W. Do T.Q. Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. Mol. Aspects Med. 1997; 18: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The accumulation of HHB is not diagnostic of the blocked step in the coq mutants, and there is accumulating evidence that a multi-subunit complex of Coq polypeptides is required to convert HHB to Q in yeast (12Hsu A.Y.

It is interesting that although yeast coq7-null mutants accumulate HHB, yeast bearing the coq7-1 allele (G104D) contain a very small amount of demethoxy-Q6 (2-hexaprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone or DMQ6) (10Marbois B.N.

Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Similar to the coq7/clk-1 orthologues from rat (16Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Kim L. Chin A. Xia Y.-R. Lusis A.J. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and human (17Vajo Z. King L.M. Jonassen T.

Mamm Genome. 1999; 10: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), C. elegans clk-1 rescues the Q-biosynthetic defect of a yeast coq7-null mutant, indicating functional conservation. Escherichia coli lacks a COQ7 homologue and instead relies on the ubiF gene product, a flavin-dependent monooxygenase unrelated to COQ7 that is essential for the hydroxylation of DMQ8 (18Kwon O. Kotsakis A. Meganathan R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 186: 157-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa orthologue of Coq7 restored Q biosynthesis in an E. coli ubiF mutant (19Stenmark P. Grunler J. Mattsson J. Sindelar P.J. Nordlund P. Berthold D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Expression of the C. elegans clk-1 homologue also rescues Q biosynthesis in an E. coli ubiF mutant (20Adachi A. Shinjyo N. Fujita D. Miyoshi H. Amino H. Watanabe Y. Kita K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Coq7/Clk-1 polypeptide was identified as a member of the di-iron carboxylate family of proteins, including methane monooxygenase, reinforcing the idea that Coq7/Clk-1 polypeptides catalyze the hydroxylation of DMQ, the penultimate step of Q biosynthesis (19Stenmark P. Grunler J. Mattsson J. Sindelar P.J. Nordlund P. Berthold D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The free-living nematode C. elegans has provided a powerful model system for the study of development and aging. Mutations in clk-1 lead to delayed embryonic and postembryonic development, slowing of adult behaviors, resistance to UV-induced stress, and a long life span (21Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13091-13096Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 22Murakami S. Johnson T.E. Genetics. 1996; 143: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wong A. Boutis P. Hekimi S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The clk-1 animals fail to synthesize Q9 but instead produce significant amounts of the Q biosynthetic intermediate DMQ9 (24Miyadera H. Amino H. Hiraishi A. Taka H. Murayama K. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. J. Biol.

Science. 2003; 302: 1779-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) of clk-1 mutants observed on the standard E. coli diet has been attributed to the presence of DMQ9, because it is believed to have fewer pro-oxidant properties than Q and is thought to function less efficiently in respiratory chain electron transport (29Miyadera H. Kano K. Miyoshi H. Ishii N. Hekimi S. Kita K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, Q8 and RQ9 are other components that may influence life span in C. elegans (30Larsen P.L. Clarke C.F. Science. 2002; 295: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and are confounding factors in determining the functional role of DMQ9 in respiration and as an antioxidant. In this study, we used the simpler model organism S. cerevisiae to study the effects of clk-1 mutations on growth, respiratory function, and quinone levels. The yeast model enables growth in the absence of dietary or exogenous Q and in the absence of RQ, which is known to function in anaerobic respiration and could possibly function in aerobic respiration as well (31van Hellemond J.J. van der Klei A. van Weelden S.W. Tielens A.G. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2003; 358: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The mutations introduced into the COQ7 gene were designed to recapitulate the C. elegans clk-1 mutations and included: E233K (e2519), predicted to disrupt the di-iron carboxylate site thought to be required for hydroxylase activity (19Stenmark P. Grunler J. Mattsson J. Sindelar P.J. Nordlund P. Berthold D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); L237Stop (qm30), deleting 36 amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus; and P175Stop (qm51), deleting the carboxyl-terminal half of Coq7p. This study shows that yeast strains producing only DMQ6 are respiration-deficient and unable to support either NADH-cytochrome c reductase or succinatecytochrome c reductase activities. Steady-state levels of cytochromes c1 and c are dramatically decreased in yeast containing DMQ6 and lacking Q6. Furthermore, the presence of DMQ6 does not protect cells against oxidative stress generated by H2O2 or linolenic acid. The results presented here indicate that DMQ fails to support respiratory activity and is a less effective antioxidant than Q and suggest that the life span extension effects observed in the C. elegans clk-1 mutants cannot be attributed solely to the presence of DMQ. Yeast Strains and Growth Media—Four yeast strains were used in this study, CEN.PK2–1C (MATa, his3-Δ1, leu2-3,112, trp1-289, ura3-52, MAL2-8c, MAL3, SUC3) (32Proft M. Kötter P. Hedges D. Bojunga N. Entian K.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6116-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), CEN.MP3–1A (CEN.PK2–1C, coq7::HIS3) (32Proft M. Kötter P. Hedges D. Bojunga N. Entian K.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6116-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), EG103 (MATα, his3Δ1, leu2-3,112, trp1-289, ura3-52) (33Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and EG110 (EG103 sod2::HIS3) (33Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth media for yeast was prepared as described previously (34Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1990Google Scholar) and included YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol), SDC (0.18% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose, 0.14% NaH2PO4, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, and complete amino acid supplement), and SD-Ura (SDC, but amino acid supplement lacks uracil). The supplement was modified as described previously (35Barkovich R.J. Shtanko A. Shepherd J.A. Lee P.T. Myles D.C. Tzagoloff A. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9182-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Yeast were grown at 30 °C with shaking. Plasmid Construction—The plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. pNMQ71 contains the wild-type COQ7 gene in the pRS316 low copy vector (10Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PCHQ71 was created by digesting pNMQ7 (10Marbois B.N. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2995-3004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) with ClaI and HindIII and ligating the fragment with pRS316 that had been similarly treated. Primer mediated mutagenesis of PCR fragments was performed with the plasmid pNMQ71. To create pE233K, a G-to-A substitution was made in the primer sequence that corresponded to position 697 in the yeast open reading frame. The forward inside primer pQ7XBAR (5′-GGATGACAAGCTAGAGCATCTAGACACCG-3′) was used with the vector primer pQ7HIN (5′-GACGGTATCGATAAGCTTTCTTTTAATTAC-3′), whereas the inside reverse primer pQ7XBA (5′-GCGGTGTCTAGATGCTCTAGCTTGTCATCC-3′) was used with a primer corresponding to positions 218–249 of the open reading frame, pQ7SPH (5′-AACCTGAGCATGCTCCCAAGTGTCAGAATT-3′). This results in a Glu-to-Lys point mutation at amino acid 233 in the encoded yeast polypeptide. To generate pL237Stop, primers contained an insertion of the TAA stop codon at positions 709–711, thus creating a stop codon at amino acid 237. The forward inside primer pQ7MUT1 (5′-GACGAGCTAGAGCATTAAGACACCGCTATC-3′) was used with pQ7-HIN, whereas the reverse inside primer pQ7MUT2 (5′-GATAGCGGTGTCTTAATGCTCTAGCTCGTC-3′) was used with pQ7SPH. In C. elegans, the qm51 allele is a mutation in the splice-site acceptor, resulting in the translation of intron 2, which contains a stop codon after seven amino acids. To create the ochre mutation of pP175Stop, the primer design included an insertion of the first eight amino acids of C. elegans intron 2, ending in a TAA stop codon at aa 175 of the yeast sequence. The forward inside primer pQ7MUT3–2 (5′-GGGAAGAAGTTTGTGGATTTGCTGTAAGCTGGTACC-3′) was used with pQ7HIN, whereas the reverse inside primer pQ7MUT4–2 (5′-TTACAGCAAATCCACAAACTTCTTCCCCATTGCAAA-3′) was used with pQ7SPH.Table IPlasmid names and identificationsPlasmid nameDescriptionLow copyMulticopypNMQ71, pCHQ71p7.8Wild-type Coq7ppRS316pRS426Empty vectorpE233KpmE233KE233K of wild-type Coq7ppL237StoppmL237StopStop at amino acid 237 of wild-type Coq7pptdL237Stoppmtd237StopTrue deletion after amino acid 237 of pL237StoppP175StoppmP175StopStop at amino acid 175 with 7-amino acid insertion Open table in a new tab For each construct, the first round of PCR using pNMQ71 as a template resulted in two PCR products that overlap and contain the same introduced mutation. These overlapping products underwent another round of PCR, with each product using the other as template (37Higuchi R. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990Google Scholar). The final PCR product was digested with SphI and HindIII and ligated into pNMQ71 that had been similarly treated. Each of the mutations was also transferred to multicopy vectors by excising the ClaI and HindIII segment and ligating the inserts into pRS426 (36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These were designated pmE233K, pmL237Stop, and pmP175Stop. All constructs were transformed into competent DH5α and amplified. A truncation representing a true L237Stop C-terminal deletion, ptdL237Stop, was created. The first PCR generated two overlapping fragments that were subsequently used in a second round of PCR to create the final product. This process removed the fragment from position 709 to the penultimate codon, maintaining the original STOP codon. The first fragment was obtained with the forward primer pQ7-d30–1F (5′-AGCTCGGAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGA-3′) and the reverse primer pQ7d30–1R (5′-TCTGGTGGTTATAGATGCTCTAGCTCGTCA-3′). The second fragment was obtained with the forward primer pQ7d30–2F (5′-GAGCATCTATAACCACCAGAAAGTGGCATA-3′) and the reverse primer pQ7d30–2R (5′-ACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAA-3′). pQ7d30–1F and pQ7d30–2R were used as primers for the second PCR reaction. Each of the constructs described (Table I) was sequenced and found to be identical to wild type except for the site-directed changes specified by the primers. Rescue Assays for Growth on a Nonfermentable Carbon Source—The constructs pE233K, pL237Stop, pP175Stop, or their multicopy counterparts were each placed into CEN.MP3–1A, a yeast strain harboring a deletion in the COQ7 gene. Transformants were selected on SD-Ura plates. Samples of each were streaked onto YPG and grown for 4 days at 30 °C. For liquid growth, yeast strains were grown overnight in 5 ml of SD-Ura. The cultures were then diluted into 50 ml of YPG (A600 = 0.1). Growth was monitored by A600 measurements. Mitochondrial Isolation and Western Blots—Crude mitochondria were isolated as described previously (38Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting employed standard methods (39Santos-Ocana C. Do T.Q. Padilla S. Navas P. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10973-10981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were used at the following dilutions: yeast porin (1:10,000), yeast cytochrome c (1:2,500), yeast cytochrome c1 (1:10,000), and F1βATPase (1:5,000). Steady-state levels of specific mitochondrial polypeptides were measured by densitometric analysis, carried out with a GS800 densitometer with software analysis by Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Quinone Isolation and Identification by HPLC/ECD and Mass Spectrometry—CEN.MP3–1A harboring each of the mutant constructs were grown in SD-Ura and harvested at either log phase or stationary phase. Crude mitochondria were isolated as described previously (38Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Lipid extractions of whole cells and quinone quantification were performed as described previously (40Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12381-12387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Quinones were quantified in isolated mitochondria after SDS solubilization and lipid extraction as described previously (39Santos-Ocana C. Do T.Q. Padilla S. Navas P. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10973-10981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In both cases, Q9 was used as an internal standard; for whole-cell extractions, 1 μgofQ9 was added per gram (wet weight) of cell pellets, and 500 ng of Q9 was added per milligram of mitochondrial protein. Lipid components were separated by a Beckmann 166-126 HPLC system equipped with a 15-cm Kromasil C-18 column in a column oven set to 40 °C, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a mobile phase containing 88:24:10 methanol/ethanol/2-propanol and 13.4 mm lithium perchlorate. Quinones were quantified with an ESA Coulochem III electrochemical detector (ECD) and a 5010 analytical cell (E1, –500 mV; E2, 500 mV). Hydroquinones present in samples were oxidized with a pre-column cell set in oxidizing mode (E, +500 mV). Q6 and Q9 were quantified with external standards. The Q6 external standard was used to quantify DMQ6, assuming a similar redox response in the ECD. For mass spectrometry analysis, 1 liter of SD-Ura-His cultures were inoculated and harvested after 2 days of growth. A600 ranged from 8.3–8.8 A600/ml. Mitochondria were isolated and lipid extracts were resolved over the HPLC/ECD system. The peaks corresponding to Q6 and DMQ6 were collected and dried down under nitrogen gas. The samples were analyzed with a PerkinElmerSciex Instruments API III triple quadropole mass spectrometer fitted with a heated nebulizer at 450 °C. The solvent was 0.33% H2O in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Instrument conditions for multiple reaction monitoring analysis were 0.3 step size; dwell, 900 ms; scan speed, 4.0 s; and oriface at 50 V; cgt, 220. These samples were compared with Q6 obtained from Sigma and DMQ8 obtained from the E. coli ubiF mutant strain AN78 (41Young I.G. Stroobant P. Macdonald C.G. Gibson F. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 42-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five transition events were monitored by multiple reaction monitoring: m/z 591.4 → m/z 197.2 and 237.2 (Q6); m/z 561.4 → m/z 167.2 and 207.1 (DMQ6); and m/z 697.4 → m/z 167.2 (DMQ8). Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Activities—Freshly obtained mitochondria were assayed for NADH-cytochrome c reductase and succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities. For assays of other respiratory chain activities, mitochondrial samples were subjected to one freezethaw cycle. All assays were performed in triplicate. NADH-DCIP reductase activity was measured as described with minor modifications (42Velazquez I. Pardo J.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 389: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The reaction was performed at 30 °C with stirring. Mitochondrial protein (10–50 μg) was incubated in reaction buffer (20 mm MES-KOH, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 mm KCl) for 3 min. The reaction was initiated with 100 μm DCIP, without NADH; after 1 min, 200 μm NADH was added. Specific NADH-DCIP reductase activity was determined by subtracting the initial linear rate before NADH addition from the rate after NADH addition. The specific activity of DCIP reduction was determined at 600 nm with an extinction coefficient of 19.1 mm–1·cm–1. Succinate-decylubiquinone reductase activity sensitive to malonate was used to measure complex II activity (43Brasseur G. Tron G. Dujardin G. Slonimski P.P. Brivet-Chevillotte P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Activity was measured in an assay volume of 1 ml with 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 40 mm sodium succinate, 100 μm decylubiquinone, 250 μm potassium cyanide, and 2 μg/ml antimycin A. Samples of mitochondria (20–50 μg of protein) were incubated in the assay buffer for 3 min. The reaction was initiated with the addition of decylubiquinone; after 1 min, succinate was added. As a control, some samples were pre-incubated with 4 mm sodium malonate and this rate was subtracted as background. Reactions were monitored via spectrophotometric measurements of absorbance at 280 nm minus 340 nm. The specific activity was determined with an extinction coefficient of 14.5 mm–1·cm–1. NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity was measured in an assay volume of 1 ml in 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm NADH, 50 μm cytochrome c, and 250 μm potassium cyanide. Samples of mitochondria (10–50 μg of protein) were incubated in the assay buffer for 3 min. The reaction was initiated by addition of cytochrome c; after 1 min, NADH was added. The reaction was monitored via spectrophotometric measurements of absorbance at 550 nm minus 540 nm. The specific activity was determined with an extinction coefficient of 18.5 mm–1· cm–1. All assays were performed in triplicate. In some experiments, the activity was measured with the addition of exogenous 10 μm Q3 and 10 μm DMQ3 after a 10-min incubation. Given that both compounds were prepared in ethanol, controls with the solvent were performed. To check the nature of cytochrome c reduction, 300 units/ml of bovine superoxide dismutase was added as control. Succinate-cytochrome c reductase and cytochrome c oxidase activities were measured as described previously (44Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superoxide production was determined in mitochondrial samples by the reduction of acetylated cytochrome c according to a method described previously (45Obungu V.H. Wang Y. Beattie D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11917-11922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The reaction was measured in final volume of 1 ml in 40 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm NADH, 40 mm sodium succinate, 10 μm acetylated cytochrome c, 250 μm potassium cyanide, and mitochondria samples (50 μg of protein). The reaction was initiated by addition of cytochrome c and after 1 min, NADH and succinate were added. The reaction was monitored in a manner similar to that described for NADH-cytochrome c reductase. Bovine superoxide dismutase (300 units/ml) was added in control experiments. All assays were performed in triplicate. Analysis of Oxidative Stress Sensitivity by Colony Counting—Yeast cells were cultured in SDC or SD-Ura media, harvested at exponential growth phase (A600 nm = 1) or early stationary growth phase (A600 nm = 4–5), washed and resuspended in sterile 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.2, with 0.2% glucose, at 180 × 106 cells/ml. Cell suspensions were incubated with different concentrations of H2O2 and linolenic acid for 4 h. Samples from each treatment were diluted and spread onto YPD plates. After 2 days at 30 °C, colonies were counted. For each treatment and strain, three plates were counted. Measurement of Superoxide Anion Generation by Flow Cytometry— Yeast cells were cultured until stationary phase and treated to produce oxidative stress as described above. Cells treated for 4 h with H2O2 (5 and 10 mm) or linolenic acid (750 μm) were harvested, washed, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. To measure cellular superoxide levels, cells were incubated with 4 μm hydroethidine (HE) for 30 min. HE is oxidized by superoxide, resulting in a product that has fluorescent properties similar to those of ethidium and that binds to DNA (46Rothe G. Valet G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1990; 47: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 47Zhao H. Kalivendi S. Zhang H. Joseph J. Nithipatikom K. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol.

Cellular levels of this oxidized product were measured by flow cytometry after excitation at 488 nm with an argon laser and detection of emitted red fluorescence (>650 nm), with a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer. The sample fluid pressure was adjusted to acquire ∼200 events per second. Growth Characteristics of Yeast coq7 Mutant Strains in Glycerol Media—Mutations were introduced into the yeast COQ7 gene to mirror each of three C. elegans clk-1 mutant alleles described previously(e2519, qm30, qm51; Table I) (15Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Primer-mediated mutagenesis was used to generate the constructs in both low and multicopy plasmids. These plasmids were transformed into the coq7Δ strain, CEN.MP3–1A. The transformants were tested for their ability to grow in liquid cultures containing glyc"
https://openalex.org/W2076198736,"The promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein has been described as a transcriptional repressor of homeobox (HOX)-containing genes during embryogenesis. As we previously demonstrated a functional link between overexpression of HOXB7 and melanoma progression, we investigated the lack of PLZF as the possible cause of HOXB7 constitutive activation in these neoplastic cells. Accordingly, we found PLZF expression in melanocytes, but not in melanoma cells, a pattern inversely related to that of HOXB7. PLZF retroviral gene transduction was then performed in a panel of melanoma cell lines, and tumorigenicity was compared with that of empty vector-transduced control cell lines. Evaluation of in vitro migration, invasion and adhesion indicated that PLZF gene transduction induced a less malignant phenotype, as confirmed through in vivo studies performed in athymic nude mice. This reduced tumorigenicity was not coupled with HOXB7 repression. In order to find more about the molecular targets of PLZF, the gene expression profiles of PLZF- and empty vector-transduced A375 melanoma cells were analysed by Atlas Cancer macroarray. Among several genes modulated by PLZF enforced expression, of particular interest were integrin alphavbeta3, osteonectin/SPARC and matrix metalloprotease-9 that were downmodulated, and the tyrosinase-related protein-1 that was upregulated in all the analysed samples. This profile confirms the reduced tumorigenic phenotype with reversion to a more differentiated, melanocyte like, pattern, thus suggesting a suppressor role for PLZF in solid tumors. Moreover, these results indicate that PLZF and HOXB7 are functionally independent and that their coupled deregulation may account for most of the alterations described in melanomas."
https://openalex.org/W2025890181,"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling may be mediated through the modulation of Ras activity. We have shown previously that grade III malignant astrocytoma biopsy samples exhibit elevated levels of FAK, and that overexpression of FAK in U-251MG malignant astrocytoma cells promotes the phosphorylation of Shc, a potential upstream mediator of Ras activity. Here, we report that overexpression of FAK promotes Ras activity in U-251MG malignant astrocytoma cells cultured in aggregate suspension or as monolayers adherent to vitronectin. The overexpression of FAK also promoted the association of FAK with p120RasGAP, which is a negative regulator of Ras activity, in the U-251MG cells cultured in aggregate suspension, with this association being abrogated upon plating of the cells onto vitronectin. An association of FAK with p120RasGAP also was observed in malignant astrocytoma biopsy samples, but not in normal brain samples. As overexpression of FAK in U-251MG cells in aggregate suspension culture reduced the amount of p120RasGAP complexed with active Ras, we hypothesize that the association of FAK with p120 RasGAP may facilitate Ras activity. The overexpression of a mutated FAK in which the Y397 had been mutated to F did not result in the formation of the FAK/p120RasGAP complex and did not promote Ras activity, indicating that the Y397 residue of FAK plays a role in the formation of this complex and in the activation of Ras. Moreover, the overexpression of mutated FAK (397F) was found to inhibit anchorage-independent growth. These data provide the basis for a previously undescribed mechanism in which the elevated expression of FAK can promote Ras activity through its competitive recruitment of p120RasGAP, thereby diminishing the association of p120RasGAP with active Ras."
https://openalex.org/W2045453940,"The tumor suppressor protein BARD1 plays a dual role in response to genotoxic stress: DNA repair as a BARD1–BRCA1 heterodimer and induction of apoptosis in a BRCA1-independent manner. We have constructed a series of BARD1 deletion mutants and analysed their cellular distribution and capacity to induce apoptosis. As opposed to previous studies suggesting an exclusively nuclear localization of BARD1, we found, both in tissues and cell cultures, nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of BARD1. Enhanced cytoplasmic localization of BARD1, as well as appearance of a 67 kDa C-terminal proteolytic cleavage product, coincided with apoptosis. BARD1 translocates to the nucleus independently of BRCA1. For recruitment to nuclear dots, however, the BRCA1-interacting RING finger domain is required but not sufficient. Protein levels of N-terminal RING finger deletion mutants were much higher than those of full-length BARD1, despite comparable mRNA levels, suggesting that the N-terminal region comprising the RING finger is important for BARD1 degradation. Sequences required for apoptosis induction were mapped between the ankyrin repeats and the BRCT domains coinciding with two known cancer-associated missense mutations. We suggest that nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of BARD1 reflect its dual function and that the increased cytoplasmic localization of BARD1 is associated with apoptosis."

PCC 6803 (Synechocystis). We have demonstrated that the expression of the above four genes was also elevated in the dark-adapted Synechocystis cells upon glucose treatment as a consequence of transcriptional activation. Treatment with glucose analogs such as l-glucose, 3-O-methylglucose, 2-deoxyglucose, and mannose, or inactivation of glucose uptake and phosphorylation by deletion mutation of glucose transporter (glcP) and glucokinase (gk), respectively, did not induce up-regulation of carotenoid genes. When respiratory electron transport or coupling to oxidative phosphorylation was inhibited, glucose induction was not observed, indicating that respiratory electron transport per se is not critical for the expression of these genes. In agreement with this view, the extent of gene expression showed a saturation curve with increasing acridine yellow fluorescence yield, without having a close correlation with the ATP contents or ATP/ADP ratio. The results indicate that glucose induction of carotenoid gene expressions is mediated by an increase in cytosolic pH rather than either redox or glucose sensing.

https://openalex.org/W1999302375,"Leukotriene (LT) A4 hydrolase is a bifunctional zinc metalloenzyme, which converts LTA4 into the neutrophil chemoattractant LTB4 and also exhibits an anion-dependent aminopeptidase activity. In the x-ray crystal structure of LTA4 hydrolase, Arg563 and Lys565 are found at the entrance of the active center. Here we report that replacement of Arg563, but not Lys565, leads to complete abrogation of the epoxide hydrolase activity. However, mutations of Arg563 do not seem to affect substrate binding strength, because values of Ki for LTA4 are almost identical for wild type and (R563K)LTA4 hydrolase.

For the aminopeptidase reaction, mutations of Arg563 reduce the catalytic activity (Vmax = 0.3–20%), whereas mutations of Lys565 have limited effect on catalysis (Vmax = 58–108%).

The leukotrienes (LTs) 1The abbreviations used are: LT, leukotriene; LTA4H, leukotriene A4 hydrolase; pNA, p-nitroanilide.1The abbreviations used are: LT, leukotriene; LTA4H, leukotriene A4 hydrolase; pNA, p-nitroanilide. are a class of structurally related lipid mediators involved in the development and maintenance of inflammatory and allergic reactions (1Samuelsson B.

Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar). In the biosynthesis of LTs, 5-lipoxygenase converts arachidonic acid into the unstable epoxide LTA4. This intermediate may in turn be conjugated with glutathione to form the spasmogenic LTC4, or hydrolyzed into the proinflammatory lipid mediator LTB4,ina reaction catalyzed by LTA4 hydrolase (LTA4H). Leukotriene B4 is a classical chemoattractant of human neutrophils and triggers adherence and aggregation of leukocytes to vascular endothelium at only nanomolar concentrations (3Samuelsson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). In addition, LTB4 modulates immune responses (4Payan D.G. Missirian-Bastian A. Goetzl E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These effects are signaled via specific, G protein-coupled receptors for LTB4 (BLT1 and BLT2) (14Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T.

Med. 2000; 192: 421-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The relative contributions of these two receptors to signaling and bioactivity are presently not clear. LTA4H (EC 3.3.2.6) is a bifunctional zinc metalloenzyme, exhibiting an anion-dependant aminopeptidase activity in addition to its epoxide hydrolase activity, i.e. the hydrolysis of the unstable allelic epoxide LTA4 into LTB4, for a review, see Ref. 16Haeggström J.Z. Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar. Unlike the aminopeptidase activity, the epoxide hydrolase activity is restrained by suicide inactivation that involves binding of LTA4 to Tyr378, which is located within a 21-residue active-site peptide denoted K21 (17Mueller M.J. Wetterholm A. Blomster M. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8383-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Mueller M.J. Blomster M.

The epoxide hydrolase reaction of LTA4H is also unique in the sense that the stereoselective introduction of water to the carbon backbone of LTA4 occurs several methylene units away from the epoxide moiety, presumably proceeding via a carbocation intermediate (19Blomster Andberg M. Hamberg M. Haeggström J.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23057-23063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Asp375 was shown to assist in the introduction of the 12R hydroxyl group of LTB4 (20Rudberg P.C. Tholander F. Thunnissen M.M. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Certain arginyl di- and tripeptides as well as p-nitroanilide derivatives of Ala and Arg are very efficient substrates for the aminopeptidase activity (24Örning L. Gierse J.K. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11269-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has never been proven, it is generally believed that the peptidase activity is involved in the processing of bioactive peptides related to inflammation and host defense. Several lines of evidence indicate that the aminopeptidase activity follows a zinc-assisted general base mechanism with Glu296 and Tyr383 acting as the general base and proton donor, respectively. Moreover, in recent studies, Glu271 was identified as the recognition site for the N-terminal amino group of the peptidase substrate (25Rudberg P.C. Tholander F. Thunnissen M.M. Haeggström J.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1398-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Recently, we solved the crystal structure of LTA4H in complex with the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin at 1.95-Å resolution, which has given important clues to the molecular mechanisms of the two enzyme reactions (26Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggström J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Earlier work with chemical modification already indicated the presence of essential Arg residues near or at the active center of LTA4H (27Mueller M.J. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3536-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). From the x-ray crystal structure of LTA4H, a positively charged site was identified in a cavity formed between the N-terminal, the central catalytic, and the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1). This site, composed of Arg563 and Lys565, is located in a wide portion of the cavity, near its entrance, and in the vicinity of the carboxyl group of bestatin. These two residues are positioned in the first turn of an α-helix pointing toward the active site. Whereas Arg563 is buried, Lys565 is fully exposed to solvent. Also, when LTA4 was modeled into the active site, electrostatic interactions seemed possible between the C1 carboxylate of LTA4 and the positively charged side groups of Arg563 and/or Lys565 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, in the crystal structure of LTA4H in complex with a specific hydroxamic acid inhibitor that is a structural mimic of LTA4, a direct interaction between the carboxylic moiety of this inhibitor and Arg563 is seen (28Thunnissen M.M. Andersson B. Samuelsson B. Wong C.H. Haeggström J.Z. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1648-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this report we used site-directed mutagenesis combined with x-ray crystallography and inhibition studies to analyze the functional role of Arg563 and Lys565 as putative carboxylate recognition sites in LTA4H. We show that Arg563 is required for the epoxide hydrolase activity, presumably in an indirect manner to achieve correct alignment of LTA4 along the catalytic elements of the active site. As a result, Arg563 is a key residue during LTB4 formation. For the aminopeptidase reaction, we propose that Lys565 assists Arg563 for optimal substrate binding. Thus, we have identified a common carboxylate recognition site for lipid and peptide substrates in the active center of LTA4H. Materials—Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Cybergene, Stockholm, Sweden. LTA4 methyl ester was synthesized as described (29Ollmann I.R. Hogg J.H. Munoz B. Haeggström J.Z. Samuelsson B. Wong C.-H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 969-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Plymouth Meeting, PA. LTA4 methyl ester was saponified in tetrahydrofuran with 1 m LiOH (6% v/v) for 48 h at 4 °C. Alanine-p-nitroanilide, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and streptomycin sulfate were purchased from Sigma. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from Qiagen. Mutagenesis of Human LTA4H cDNA—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by PCR on the recombinant plasmid pT3MB5 for expression of (His)6-tagged LTA4H in Escherichia coli. This plasmid is a variant of pT3MB4 (18Mueller M.J. Blomster M. Oppermann U.C. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5931-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in which an NsiI restriction site has been eliminated by a single nucleotide exchange. Briefly, site-directed mutagenesis involves two consecutive steps of PCR comprising four different primers, according to the megaprimer method (30Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reactions were carried out in a total volume of 50 μl, using 1× Pfu polymerase buffer, 125–150 ng each of primers A and B, 1 unit of Pfu polymerase, 10 nmol each of dNTPs, and 100 ng of template. In the second reaction, 15–20 μl of the first PCR mixture was used to supply the reaction with the megaprimer, which was used together with primer C (125–150 ng). The amplification program included an initial round of denaturation at 94 °C (60 s), annealing at 55–66 °C (60 s), and elongation at 72 °C (90 s), followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (45 s), annealing (30 s), and elongation (60 s) on a PE GeneAmp PCR System 2400. For generation of (E560Q)-, (R563K)-, (R563A)-, (R563M)-, (K565R)-, (K565A)-, (K565M)-, and (R563K/K565R)LTA4H, BfrI and NsiI sites were used. DNA fragments were cleaved with BfrI/NsiI and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis (1.5%) followed by extraction (QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit). Mutated fragments were ligated into pT3MB5 (T4 DNA Ligase Protocol), opened with the same restriction enzymes. Competent E. coli cells (JM101) were transformed with mutated recombinant plasmid and grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Stock cultures were kept at -70 °C in a 1:1 mixture of culture medium and 40% (v/v) glycerol, 0.75% (w/v) NaCl, respectively. Recombinant plasmids were purified using Wizard Minipreps Plus, and the entire mutated inserts were all sequenced using Dynamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham Biosciences) to confirm that no nucleotide alterations had occurred in addition to the desired mutation. Protein Expression and Purification—Mutated enzymes were expressed as N-terminal (His)6-tag fusion proteins in E. coli (JM101) cells grown at 37 °C in M9 medium (50 mm Na2HPO4, 22 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm NH4Cl, 8.5 mm NaCl), pH 7.4, containing 0.4% glucose (w/v), 0.2% (w/v) casamino acids, 2 mm MgSO4, and 0.1 mm CaCl2. At A620 ≈ 0.2, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 500 μm. Cells were harvested at A620 ≈ 1.8, pelleted at 1000 × g, and resuspended in 30 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing soybean trypsin inhibitor) supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Nucleic acids were removed by streptomycin sulfate precipitation. After centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min), the supernatant was filtered (0.22 μm) and applied to a nickelnitrilotriacetic acid resin. The column was washed with 1 bed volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.5 m NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with each solution supplemented with 10 mm imidazole. The His-tagged protein was eluted with 1.4 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm imidazole. The purity of the final preparation was assessed by SDS-PAGE on a Pharmacia Phast system, using 10–15% gradient gels, subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using a MCC/340 96-well multiscan spectrophotometer and bovine serum albumin as standard (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Aminopeptidase Activity Assays—The aminopeptidase activity, expressed as Vmax, was determined in a spectrophotometric assay at 405 nm, using a MCC/340 multiscan spectrophotometer, essentially as described (32Wetterholm A. Haeggström J.Z. Samuelsson B. Yuan W. Munoz B. Wong C.-H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 275: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme (1–20 μg) was incubated at room temperature in 96-well microtiter plates with alanine-p-nitroanilide as substrate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm KCl. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured at 10-min intervals. Different concentrations of substrate (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 mm) were used for kinetic determinations. Spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate was corrected by subtracting the absorbance of blank incubations without enzyme. The Michaelis constant (Km) and Vmax were determined by plotting the calculated velocity as a function of substrate concentration, whereby a nonlinear regression analysis was performed. Epoxide Hydrolase Activity Assays and Reverse-phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography—The epoxide hydrolase activity, expressed as Vmax, was determined from incubations of enzyme (1–20 μg) in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with LTA4 (2.5–125 μm) for 30 s on ice. Reactions were quenched with 200 μl of MeOH, followed by the addition of 0.4 nmol of prostaglandin B1 or prostaglandin B2 as internal standards. Samples were acidified with 5 μl of acetic acid (10%), and metabolites were extracted on solid phase Chromabond C18 columns. Metabolites of LTA4 were separated by isocratic reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Waters Nova-Pak C18 column eluted with a mixture of methanol/acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (30:30: 40:0.01, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. The UV detector was set at 270 nm and metabolites were quantified using the program Chromatography Station for Windows version 1.7. Calculations were based on peak area measurements and the known extinction coefficients for the internal standards prostaglandin B1 and prostaglandin B2 (30,000 m-1 × cm-1) as well as LTB4 (50,000 m-1 × cm-1). The Michaelis constant (Km) and Vmax were determined by plotting the calculated velocity as a function of substrate concentration, whereby a non-linear regression analysis was performed. Inhibition Assays—Prior to performing aminopeptidase activity assays, wild type-, (R563K)- and (R563M)LTA4H were preincubated with a hydroxamic acid inhibitor, 0.01–0.3 μm,orLTA4,1–10 μm. Aminopeptidase assays were then performed as described. Crystallization—Plate-like crystals of (R563A)LTA4H were obtained by liquid-liquid diffusion in capillaries, as previously described (26Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggström J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of precipitation solution (28% (v/v) PEG8000, 0.1 mm sodium acetate, 0.1 mm imidazole buffer, pH 6.8, and 5 mm YbCl3) was injected into the bottom of a melting point capillary and an equal volume of (R563A)LTA4H (5 mg/ml) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 1 mm bestatin, was layered on top. Data Collection and Structure Determination—For data collection, crystals were soaked in 15% (w/v) PEG8000, 50 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm imidazole buffer, pH 6.8, 2.5 mm YbCl3, and 25% (v/v) glycerol. Data were collected at beamline I711 of Max-Lab, Lund, Sweden. A complete set of data was collected from a single crystal. Statistics on data collection and quality are given in Table I. The crystals belonged to space group P212121 with cell dimensions a = 78, b = 86.85, c = 98.95, α = β = γ = 90° at 100 K.

During refinement, 614 water molecules, one Zn2+ ion, one imidazole molecule, one acetate molecule, and one Yb3+ ion were identified. The final R-factor was 18.8% and the Rfree factor was 23.9%. 3.3% of total reflections were set aside to calculate the Rfree. Most of the model of (R563A)LTA4H is in good density except for the (His)6 tag and the first four N-terminal residues. In the model, 99.4% of the residues are confined to the most favorable or additionally allowed regions and 0.6% in the generously allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.

We also reversed the positions of Arg563 and Lys565, generating the double crossover mutant (R563K/K565R)LTA4H. As control, we exchanged Glu560 for a Gln, generating (E560Q)LTA4H. This control residue was selected on the basis of proximity to the active site and predicted non-catalytic nature. The resulting 8 mutants were all expressed as (His)6-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli, to allow rapid purification on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resins. The level of expression was similar for wild type enzyme and all mutants, with a final yield of 2.4–6.5 mg of purified protein per liter of cell culture. Catalytic Properties of Mutants of Arg563—Mutagenetic replacements of Arg563 completely eliminated the epoxide hydrolase activity of LTA4H (Table II). Thus, neither (R563K)-, (R563A)-, nor (R563M)LTA4H converted LTA4 into detectable amounts of LTB4. Although these mutations also strongly reduced the aminopeptidase activity, the effects were not quite as detrimental as for the epoxide hydrolase reaction. Thus, in (R563K)LTA4H, Vmax and Km reached 6.4 and 58%, respectively, of wild type enzyme, whereas in (R563A)LTA4H, the aminopeptidase activity was almost completely abolished, with a Vmax and Km for Ala-pNA of 0.3 and 6.2%, respectively. On the other hand, (R563M)LTA4H exhibited a Vmax and Km of 20 and 179%, respectively, of wild type enzyme (Table II). Accordingly, the specificity constants of both (R563K)- and (R563M)LTA4H were reduced to only 11% of the wild type enzyme, whereas the specificity constant for (R563A)LTA4H only reached 5%.Table IIKinetic parameters for the aminopeptidase and epoxide hydrolase activities Mutated recombinant enzymes were expressed in E. coli, purified by affinity chromatography, and assayed for the aminopeptidase and epoxide hydrolase activity.

(K565R)LTA4H exhibited a Vmax and Km of 95 and 104%, respectively, of wild type enzyme, whereas for (K565A)LTA4H, Vmax and Km for LTA4 were 31 and 14%, respectively, and for (K565M)LTA4H these values mounted to 32 and 33%, respectively, of wild type enzyme (Table II). In addition, the specificity constants for the more conservative mutant (K565R)LTA4H and for (K565M)LTA4H remained unchanged (95 and 92%, respectively) and even increased for (K565A)LTA4H (218%), indicating that the substrate binding and catalytic residues are not drastically altered in these mutants. For the aminopeptidase activity, on the other hand, exchange of Lys565 for an Ala or Met mostly affected the Michaelis constant, with only marginal effects on the Vmax value, whereas exchange of Lys565 for an Arg affected neither Vmax nor Km. Thus, for (K565A)LTA4H, Vmax and Km were 78 and 483%, respectively, of the wild type enzyme, and for (K565M)LTA4H the corresponding values were 58 and 645%, respectively. For (K565R)LTA4H, which retains the positive charge, values of Vmax and Km remained at 108 and 82%, respectively (Table II). The effects on the Michaelis constants were also reflected in the specificity constants of (K565A)- and (K565M)LTA4H, which were reduced to 16 and 9%, respectively, but increased minimally in (K565R)LTA4H to 132%. It should be noted that Lys565 is part of a salt bridge involving Glu533 and that effects of mutations may, at least to some extent, be explained by a disturbance of these charge interactions. Control Mutants (R563K/K565R)- and (E560Q)LTA4H—As expected, the double crossover mutant (R563K/K565R)LTA4H, yielded an enzyme devoid of epoxide hydrolase activity, as seen in (R563K)LTA4H. However, (R563K/K565R)LTA4H exhibited a reduced peptidase activity, exhibiting a Vmax and Km of 18 and 47%, respectively, of wild type enzyme. The specificity constant for the double crossover mutant attained 39% of that of wild type enzyme. The control mutation close to Arg563 and Lys565 did not cause any major effects on enzyme catalysis. For the epoxide hydrolase activity, (E560Q)LTA4H exhibited a Vmax and Km of 61 and 60%, respectively, of wild type enzyme (Table II). As a consequence, the specificity constant was not significantly changed. For the aminopeptidase activity, (E560Q)LTA4H exhibited a Vmax and Km of 39 and 109%, respectively, of wild type enzyme (Table II). The kcat/Km value for (E560Q)LTA4H was reduced to 36%. Analysis of LTA4 Binding Strength by Enzyme Inhibition Assays—Because all mutants in position 563 lacked epoxide hydrolase activity, inhibition assays against the residual aminopeptidase activity were carried out to probe the effects of mutations on the binding of LTA4. For (R563K)- and (R563M)LTA4H, the hydroxamic acid inhibitor exhibited a Ki of 0.1 and 0.2 μm, as compared with 0.01 μm for wild type enzyme. In contrast, no significant difference in Ki could be detected between (R563K)-, (R563M)-, and wild type LTA4H when employing LTA4 as an inhibitor of the aminopeptidase activity (Table III). Thus, the Ki for LTA4 (0–10 μm) was determined to 7.5, 5.5, and 8 μm for (R563K)-, (R563M)-, and wild type LTA4H, respectively. These values are similar to previously reported Km values for LTA4 (5–30 μm), suggesting that the substrate binds equally strong and in similar conformations to both mutated and wild type LTA4H.Table IIIInhibition assays Values for inhibition constants (Ki) are in"

The α enhancer is active in T cells and drives TCRα recombination in collaboration with a locus control region-like element located downstream of the Cα gene on mouse chromosome 14. Twelve kb further down-stream lies another gene, Dad1, with a program of expression different from that of TCRα. The ∼6-kb locus control region element lying between them contains multiple regulatory sites with a variety of roles in regulating the two genes. Previous evidence has indicated that among these there are widely distributed regions with enhancer blocking (insulating) activity. We have shown in this report that one of these sites, not previously examined, strongly binds the insulator protein CCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in vitro and in vivo and can function in an enhancer blocking assay. However, other regions within the 6-kb element that also can block enhancers clearly do not harbor CTCF sites and thus must reflect the presence of a previously undetected and distinct vertebrate insulator activity.

The T cell receptor genes (TCR) 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell receptor; HS, hypersensitive site; TAD1, TCRα-Dad1; MAR, matrix attachment region. play a central role in the development of T lymphocytes. Rearrangement within the TCR α, β, γ, and δ gene segments lead to specific recognition and immunological response to foreign antigens. The heterodimeric αβ TCR is expressed in the major subset of circulating peripheral blood T cells, whereas the γδ TCR is expressed in a minor population of T cells. The α and δ genes are located on the same locus in human, mouse, and chicken genomes, and a separate enhancer has been identified for each of the TCR genes (Fig. 1A; reviewed in Ref. 1Glusman G. Rowen L. Lee I. Boysen C. Roach J.C. Smit A.F. Wang K. Koop B.F. Hood L. Immunity. 2001; 15: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). During mouse embryonic development, the δ genes are rearranged at 14 days of gestation, whereas the rearrangement of the α genes starts at day 16. Consequently, TCR ontogeny is tightly regulated by a complex array of cis-acting elements and targeted changes in chromatin structure exerting either positive or negative regulatory effects on V(D)J recombination (reviewed in Ref. 2Krangel M.S. McMurry M.T. Hernandez-Munain C. Zhong X.P. Carabana J. Immunol. Res. 2000; 22: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In T cell lines, nine hypersensitive sites (HS) have been identified in the 3′ region of the TCRα locus (Fig. 1C). HS1 maps to the TCRα enhancer (3Winoto A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 59: 649-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), HS7 and 8 are located within the Cα gene (4Diaz P. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 207-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and HS1′ (5Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1901-1909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and HS2–6 (4Diaz P. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 207-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) lie downstream of Eα. Constructs containing HS2–6 are required for cell-specific, copy number-dependent TCRα expression in transgenic mice, independent of the integration site of the transgene (4Diaz P. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 207-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, it was suggested that this region may be the locus control region (LCR) of the TCRα locus, consisting of a set of important elements that control the locus accessibility to regulatory factors by opening the chromatin structure as described for other LCRs (6Grosveld F. van Assendelft G.B. Greaves D.R. Kollias G. Cell. 1987; 51: 975-985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar, 7Orkin S.H.

Using a gene targeting approach to study the role of the TCRα LCR in vivo, Hong et al. (9Hong N.A. Cado D. Mitchell J. Ortiz B.D. Hsieh S.N. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) have identified a new gene located 12 kb downstream of the α constant region and the region containing the hypersensitive sites (Fig. 1, A and C). This gene, Dad1, is expressed ubiquitously (9Hong N.A. Cado D. Mitchell J. Ortiz B.D. Hsieh S.N. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the coding sequences of Dad1 are highly conserved between species even in organisms that do not have TCR genes, such as yeast (10Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or Caenorhabditis elegans (11Sugimoto A. Hozak R.R. Nakashima T. Nishimoto T. Rothman J.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4434-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Dad1 protein has been shown to play a role in preventing apoptosis in certain cell types (10Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Kuraoka A. Fukushima K. Shibata Y. Komiyama S.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 1888-1893PubMed Google Scholar) and is also a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase enzyme complex that initiates N-linked glycosylation (10Silberstein S. Collins P.G. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 371-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Makishima T. Nakashima T. Nagata-Kuno K. Fukushima K. Iida H. Sakaguchi M. Ikehara Y. Komiyama S. Nishimoto T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The nine DNase I hypersensitive elements within the 12-kb region separating the TCRα locus and Dad1 form distinct patterns in lymphoid tissues where both TCRα and Dad1 are expressed and in non-lymphoid tissues where only Dad1 is expressed. The replacement of HS2–6 in its natural context impairs Dad1 expression, resulting in early lethality of mice (9Hong N.A. Cado D. Mitchell J. Ortiz B.D. Hsieh S.N. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Indeed, mice carrying this deletion die at 7 days post coitum, before TCRα activation, suggesting that this region is important for both TCRα and Dad1 expression. Moreover, a deletion of Eα that leaves HS2–6 intact abolishes V(D)J recombination and transcription of the TCRα gene, indicating that HS2–6 cannot control TCRα expression in the absence of the enhancer (15Sleckman B.P. Bardon C.G. Ferrini R. Davidson L. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 505-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a deletion of HS2–6 that leaves Eα intact affects TCRα expression (9Hong N.A. Cado D. Mitchell J. Ortiz B.D. Hsieh S.N. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, Zhong and Krangel (16Zhong X.P. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the HS2–6 is a boundary element that has an LCR-like activity, able to confer copy number-dependent and integration site-independent expression on an Eα-containing transgene (4Diaz P. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 1994; 1: 207-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 5Ortiz B.D. Cado D. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1901-1909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but also able to protect both against ectopic activation of the TCRα by Dad1 regulatory elements and, reciprocally, against Eα activation of Dad1 expression in T cells. They also showed that HS2–6 blocks an enhancer from activating a promoter when located between the two (16Zhong X.P. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar). However, in addition to enhancer-blocking activity, HS2–6 also shows a synergistic activation property when located upstream of the enhancer, suggesting that this region is a mosaic of regulatory elements involved in a complex regulation system for both TCRα and Dad1 genes. Known insulator elements vary greatly in their DNA sequences and the specificity of proteins that bind to them. However, they share at least one of the two following properties: (i) they have the ability to act as an enhancer blocker when placed between an enhancer and the promoter, and (ii) they have the ability to protect against position effects due to the chromosomal environment (17Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Science. 2001; 291: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 18Gerasimova T.I. Corces V.G. Annu. Rev.

The first vertebrate insulator to be described is located near the 5′ end of the chicken β-globin locus (20Chung J.H. Whiteley M. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1993; 74: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). A number of insulators have now been identified in other vertebrates, located between genes with independent patterns of expression and consistent with a role in preventing inappropriate interaction between the regulatory elements of the neighboring loci. The insulators at the ribosomal RNA genes of Xenopus (21Robinett C.C. O'Connor A. Dunaway M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2866-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the Bead-1 element at human TCRα/δ locus (22Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G.

Nature. 2000; 405: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) are bound by the CTCF protein. Moreover, CTCF sites have been found recently at the Tsix locus, suggesting also a role for CTCF in X inactivation (25Chao W. Huynh K.D. Spencer R.J. Davidow L.S. Lee J.T. Science. 2002; 295: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The CTCF protein is only present in higher eukaryotes, and its sequence is highly conserved among species. CTCF is a multivalent protein that binds to different targets through the combinatorial use of its 11 zinc fingers and can be involved in gene activation or repression and chromatin insulation (26Ohlsson R. Renkawitz R. Lobanenkov V. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a search for potential binding sites for CTCF within the region between the TCRα locus and the Dad1 gene. We began by comparing this DNA sequence to all the known CTCF sites. Despite the presence of several close homologies, in vitro binding studies followed by in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed only a single CTCF binding site, located downstream of the enhancer of the TCRα locus and possessing a strong enhancer blocking activity in our assay. We also undertook a quantitative study of the pattern of histone acetylation across the region that revealed that this enhancer blocking site may be associated with a more complex array of regulatory elements. Surprisingly, although we confirmed the enhancer blocking activity of the region containing sites HS2–6 as previously described (16Zhong X.P. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar), we found no evidence of additional CTCF sites in this region. This indicates the presence of novel enhancer blocking insulator elements that remain to be characterized. Our results suggest that the CTCF protein participates in the insulator activity of this region, allowing proper expression of TCRα and DadI genes, but is working in concert with previously unrecognized mechanisms of insulation. Cell Culture—The human erythroleukemia cell line K562 was maintained in improved minimal essential medium. The mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 was grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. AKR1.G. 1.Ovar.1.26 T lymphocytes were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine and 10% horse serum. All cell lines were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Cells (5 × 109) were harvested, rinsed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 0.67 × phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol in the presence of proteases inhibitors, and nuclei were released by Dounce homogenization. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were Dounce-homogenized, stirred on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and stored at -80 °C.

Because CTCF can bind different DNA sequences, other potential CTCF sites within the TCRα-Dad1 intergenic region were searched and tested for binding activity: 147–195, ACTCGTCACGGCTGCTGACATGGGCAAACAGGTCCCCCTTTGAAGCTCTCCCGCAGAAGCCACATCCTCTGGAAAGAGGAGT; 2780–2810, CTCTGTGTAGCCCTGGCGCTGCTGTCCTGGAACTCACTCTGTAGACCAGAC; 1860–1850, ACGTCGGATGCACCCATGCTGCGATAAAACGAGCCTGCTGCGTGAGGATGCCGGCGCTCACATA; 3607–3655, ACTGACTATTGAAGTTCTCTGACCGTCACAGGCACGCGCCACACCATCCCCGCCATGAGACTGAGCCTACAGTTTAT; 3647–3724, CGCGTGCCTGTGACGGTCAGAGAACTTCAATAGTCAGTTCTCTACCTCTGCGTGGAGCTGGGGGGGGGGGTCAATCTCAGATCACCGGGGCTGCTCAGA. The corresponding homologies are indicated in Fig. 1C. Gel mobility shift assays were carried out in a binding buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100. DNA binding was carried out at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of 1–2 μl of nuclear extract, 20–40 fmol of end-labeled probe, and 100 μg/ml poly(dI/dC). Cold competitors were added simultaneously with the labeled probes at 50–100-fold molar excess. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated in binding buffer at 4 °C for 2 h with anti-CTCF antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature with the DNA as described above. Southwestern Experiments—The Southwestern procedure is based on a protocol previously described (27Yusufzai T.M. Wolffe A.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4172-4179Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (25 μg) and recombinant CTCF proteins (0.5 μg) were resolved by 4–20% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred at 4 °C for 5 h at 350 mAmps to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After transfer, immobilized proteins were denatured for 5 min in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, followed by four successive 2-fold dilutions with binding buffer only and two additional washes with binding buffer alone. The filters were then blocked for 10 min with 2% nonfat dried milk in binding buffer and washed with binding buffer alone. The filters were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in binding buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of labeled probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml) and nonspecific competitor DNA (20 μg/ml native Escherichia coli DNA, 2 μg/ml denatured E. coli DNA). Finally, the filters were washed four times in binding buffer supplemented with 0.01% Triton X-100. After air drying for 5 min, the filters were exposed to film. Formaldehyde Cross-linking and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—In vivo protein-DNA cross-linking was carried out as described (28Orlando V. Paro R. Cell. 1993; 75: 1187-1198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) with some modifications (29Magdinier F. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4990-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Generally, 1.5–2 × 108 cells were harvested and rinsed one time in phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclei were prepared in ice-cold RSB buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, nuclei were resuspended in RSB buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Proteins were then cross-linked to DNA for 10 min at room temperature, followed by 40 min at 4 °C with a final concentration of 1% in 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 8). After lysis in the presence of SDS, nucleoprotein complexes were sonicated to reduce DNA fragments to 400–600 bp. To reduce nonspecific background, the chromatin solution was precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. At this point DNA was prepared from a sample of protein A-purified chromatin and used as the input sample. Antibodies specific for acetylated histones H3 or CTCF (Upstate Biotechnology) were incubated with protein A-clarified chromatin overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After immunoprecipitation, immune complexes were collected by adding 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein Aagarose and unbound chromatin were separated, and the protein Aagarose was washed. Complexes were then eluted in 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and cross-links were reversed by heating. DNA was recovered by proteinase K digestion, phenol extraction, and ethanol precipitation. DNA samples were quantified using picogreen fluorescence (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and spectrophotometry. Primers and TaqMan Probes—Primers and TaqMan probes were selected from the region between the mouse TCRα and the Dad1 gene (GenBank™ accession numbers AF000941 and X14895) using the PE Applied Biosystems Primer Express software. Primers and TaqMan probes were obtained from Invitrogen and PE Applied Biosystems, respectively.

Gaszner M. Allis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Science. 2001; 293: 2453-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 31Litt M.D. Simpson M. Recillas-Targa F. Prioleau M.N. Felsenfeld G.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1540-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Each amplification was carried out in triplicate to control for PCR variation on 2 ng of DNA at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 15 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The Ct values were collected at 60 °C. The Ct is the number of PCR cycles necessary to reach a predetermined fluorescence intensity and is a function of the amount of target DNA in the samples analyzed. Quantification was determined by applying the comparative Ct method as described previously (31Litt M.D. Simpson M. Recillas-Targa F. Prioleau M.N. Felsenfeld G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2224-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The concentration of primers and TaqMan probes used was determined by following the optimization procedure described in PE Applied Biosystem protocol. Constructs and Enhancer Blocking Assay—Different fragments within the TCRα-Dad1 region were generated by PCR on genomic DNA and cloned into the pNI vector at the AscI site using the following primers: F311–330, 5′-AGGCGCGCCTACGGAGAGCACATTGGGTGG-3′; R1287–1307, 5′-AGGCGCGCCTCTCCTTTCCCATCAGTCCTT-3′; R1614–1633, 5′-AGGCGCGCCTAAAATGGAGA GAGACAGGGG-3′; F1450–1469, 5′-AGGCGCGCCTGTCAAGGCACAGACAGTCCG-3′; R4011–4030, 5′-AGGCGCGCCTCTGGGTTGTCGATAGATCCG-3′; F3846–3866, 5′-AGGCGCGCCTTGGTGACCCA AGCTTGAACCT-3′; R6266–6285, 5′-AGGCGCGCCTGGTTTTGCTGACTCAGGTAC-3′. We deleted the CTCF binding site using the following additional primers: F756–775(AflII), 5′-ACCCTTAAGAAAAGGCTTTCTCCCTCGGC-3′; R754–775(AflII), 5′-CCCTTAAGGCCGAGGGAGAAAGCCTTTTGG-3′. Enhancer blocking assays were performed as previously described (20Chung J.H. Whiteley M. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1993; 74: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 33Chung J.H. Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In Vivo Matrix Assay—Low ionic strength matrices from AKR1 cells were prepared as described (34Mirkovitch J. Mirault M.E. Laemmli U.K. Cell. 1984; 39: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 10 min on ice in isolation buffer (3.75 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA/KOH, 0.05 mm spermine, 0.125 mm spermidine, 0.1% digitonin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with isolation buffer. Nuclei were resuspended in isolation buffer without EDTA and incubated in a 37 °C water bath for 20 min. Extraction buffer (5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm spermidine, 0.1% digitonin, 25 mm 3,5-diiodosalicylic acid, lithium salt)) was slowly added to a final volume of 7 ml; extracted nuclei were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Following protein extraction, nuclei were digested with 100 μg/ml RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) for three hours at room temperature. Matrices were centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm, washed twice with digestion buffer, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.1% SDS, 1 mg/ml proteinase K. Matrices were digested at 50 °C O/N, phenol:chloroform extracted, and EtOH precipitated. Matrix DNA was analyzed by quantitative PCR. Search for CTCF Binding Sites within the TCRα-Dad1 Region—Because the DNA region between the TCRα locus, which is only expressed in T cells, and the ubiquitous Dad1 gene (Fig. 1A) has been shown to possess an insulator activity (16Zhong X.P. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 295-300PubMed Google Scholar), we searched for CTCF binding sites across the region flanked by the enhancer of the TCRα (Eα) and exon 3 of Dad1. We searched a 6298-bp sequence derived from the mouse T cell receptor α locus enhancer element (GenBank™ accession number X14895) and the mouse DNase I hypersensitive sites 2–6 of the LCR for the T cell receptor α chain gene (GenBank™ accession number AF000941) containing HS1, HS1′, and HS2–6. In a first attempt, the consensus binding site for insulator activity at the chicken β-globin and the Igf2/H19 loci (22Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 23Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G. Nature. 2000; 405: 482-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar) was used for this search (Fig. 1B). The best match to the consensus sequence was found at position 730–743. Over this region, 13 of the 14 bases are identical to the canonical site. At position 2878–2891, 12 of the 14 bases are identical to the consensus, whereas at positions 2296–2309, 5545–5558 and 2850–2863, and 3753–3766 the homologies are either 11/14 or 10/14. CTCF is a versatile protein that can bind to different DNA targets depending on the combinatorial use of the 11 zinc fingers. Therefore, we compared the TCRα-Dad1 sequence to the other known CTCF binding sites and found five additional potential sites (Fig. 1C). At position 147–195, a match of 25 of 47 bases to the chicken lysozyme gene silencer (35Burcin M. Arnold R. Lutz M. Kaiser B. Runge D. Lottspeich F. Filippova G.N. Lobanenkov V.V. Renkawitz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1281-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) was found. Another potential site was found at position 1806–1850, displaying a match of 26 of 46 bases to the CTCF repressor site located downstream of the human c-Myc P2 promoter (36Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Collins S.J. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). At position 2780–2810, the match of 19 bases/32 corresponds to the promoter of the amyloid β-protein precursor where CTCF activates transcription (37Vostrov A.A. Quitschke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33353-33359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Two other candidate sites were also found: a match at position 3607–3655 homologous to the chicken c-myc 5′-flanking sequence (34/46) (38Lobanenkov V.V. Nicolas R.H. Adler V.V. Paterson H. Klenova E.M. Polotskaja A.V. Goodwin G.H. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1743-1753PubMed Google Scholar) and at position 3647–3724 homologous to the CTCF methylation-sensitive insulator site at the human myotonic dystrophy locus (39Filippova G.N. Thienes C.P. Penn B.H. Cho D.H. Hu Y.J. Moore J.M. Klesert T.R. Lobanenkov V.V. Tapscott S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding of the Various Sequences to CTCF—To determine whether these candidate sequences are actually capable of binding CTCF, gel retardation assays were carried out. A set of oligonucleotides containing the potential CTCF site at position 15–28 within the 40-base pair oligonucleotides (see “Experimental Procedures”) were end-labeled and tested for the ability to bind CTCF in nuclear extracts. For each DNA fragment, the mobility was compared with the mobility of the CTCF-chicken 5′S4FII complex (FII) (22Bell A.C. West A.G. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1999; 98: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Using increasing amounts of AKR1 nuclear extract, direct binding was only observed for the site at position 730–743 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–6)"
https://openalex.org/W2151966082,"The Ape1 protein initiates the repair of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites during mammalian base excision repair (BER) of DNA. Ape1 catalyzes hydrolysis of the 5′-phosphodiester bond of abasic DNA to create nicks flanked by 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-deoxyribose 5-phosphate (dRP) termini. DNA polymerase (pol) β catalyzes both DNA synthesis at the 3′-hydroxyl terminus and excision of the 5′-dRP moiety prior to completion of BER by DNA ligase. During BER, Ape1 recruits pol β to the incised apurinic/apyrimidinic site and stimulates 5′-dRP excision by pol β. The activities of these two enzymes are thus coordinated during BER. To examine further the coordination of BER, we investigated the ability of Ape1 to modulate the deoxynucleotidyltransferase and 5′-dRP lyase activities of pol β. We report here that Ape1 stimulates 5′-dRP excision by a mechanism independent of its apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity. We also demonstrate a second mechanism, independent of Ape1, in which conditions that support DNA synthesis by pol β also enhance 5′-dRP excision. Ape1 modulates the gap-filling activity of pol β by specifically inhibiting synthesis on an incised abasic substrate but not on single-nucleotide gapped DNA. In contrast to the wild-type Ape1 protein, a catalytically impaired mutant form of Ape1 did not affect DNA synthesis by pol β. However, this mutant protein retained the ability to stimulate 5′-dRP excision by pol β. Simultaneous monitoring of 5′-dRP excision and DNA synthesis by pol β demonstrated that the 5′-dRP lyase activity lags behind the polymerase activity despite the coordination of these two steps by Ape1 during BER.

https://openalex.org/W2170110359,"Thrombin activates human platelets through three different membrane receptors, the protease-activated receptors PAR-1 and PAR-4 and the glycoprotein Ib (GPIb)-IX-V complex. We investigated the contribution of these three receptors to thrombin-induced activation of the small GTPase Rap1B. We found that, similarly to thrombin, selective stimulation of either PAR-1 or PAR-4 by specific activating peptides caused accumulation of GTP-bound Rap1B in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, in PAR-1- and PAR-4-desensitized platelets, thrombin failed to activate Rap1B. Thrombin, PAR-1-, or PAR-4-activating peptides also induced the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and the release of serotonin in a dose-dependent manner. We found that activation of Rap1B by selected doses of agonists able to elicit comparable intracellular Ca2+ increase and serotonin release was differently dependent on secreted ADP. In the presence of the ADP scavengers apyrase or phosphocreatine-phosphocreatine kinase, activation of Rap1B induced by stimulation of either PAR-1 or PAR-4 was totally inhibited. By contrast, thrombin-induced activation of Rap1B was only minimally affected by neutralization of secreted ADP. Concomitant stimulation of both PAR-1 and PAR-4 in the presence of ADP scavengers still resulted in a strongly reduced activation of Rap1B. A similar effect was also observed upon blockade of the P2Y12 receptor for ADP, as well as in P2Y12 receptor-deficient human platelets, but not after blockade of the P2Y1 receptor. Activation of Rap1B induced by thrombin was not affected by preincubation of platelets with the anti-GPIbα monoclonal antibody AK2 in the absence of ADP scavengers or a P2Y12 antagonist but was totally abolished when secreted ADP was neutralized or after blockade of the P2Y12 receptor. Similarly, cleavage of the extracellular portion of GPIbα by the cobra venom mocarhagin totally prevented Rap1B activation induced by thrombin in the presence of apyrase and in P2Y12 receptor-deficient platelets. By contrast, inhibition of MAP kinases or p160ROCK, which have been shown to be activated upon thrombin binding to GPIb-IX-V, did not affect agonist-induced activation of Rap1B in the presence of ADP scavengers. These results indicate that although both PAR-1 and PAR-4 signal Rap1B activation, the ability of thrombin to activate this GTPase independently of secreted ADP involves costimulation of both receptors as well as binding to GPIb-IX-V.

The small GTPase Rap1 is involved in the regulation of integrin activation and cell adhesion (1Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Like other members of the Ras family of small GTPases, Rap1 is activated by binding of GTP and inactivated by hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP. Constitutive active Rap1 increases adhesion mediated by β1 and β2 integrins in transfected cells, whereas expression of dominant negative mutants of Rap1, as well as overexpression of Rap1GAP, blocks integrin-mediated adhesion (2Reedquist K.A.

Intracellular Ca2+ and protein kinase C have been proposed to mediate agonist-induced Rap1B activation in platelets (10Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L.

However, more recently it has been reported that platelet Rap1B can also be activated by stimulation of members of the Gi family of heterotrimeric G-proteins in the absence of a Ca2+ increase or protein kinase C stimulation (12Lova P.

For instance, the α2A-adrenergic receptor, which couples to Gαz in platelets, mediates epinephrine-induced activation of Rap1B (12Lova P. Paganini S. Sinigaglia F. Balduini C. Torti M. J. Biol.

ADP stimulates platelets by binding to two different purinergic receptors on the platelet surface, P2Y1 and P2Y12 coupled to Gαq and Gαi, respectively (16Kunapuli S.P.

Studies with selective pharmacological inhibitors and with platelets from Gαi-knockout mice clearly have demonstrated a predominant contribution of the P2Y12 receptor in ADP-induced Rap1B activation (12Lova P.

Other platelet agonists, such as the thromboxane A2 analogue U46619 and the glycoprotein VI (GPVI)-selective 1The abbreviations used are: GP, glycoprotein; PAR, protease-activated receptor; TRAP, thrombin receptor-activating peptide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RBD, Rap binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase. snake venom convulxin, largely rely on binding of secreted ADP to the P2Y12 receptor to promote Rap1B activation (12Lova P.

Because it has been shown that stimulation of a Gi-dependent pathway is generally necessary to support integrin αIIbβ3-dependent platelet aggregation (19Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8070-8074Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 20Paul B.Z.S. Jin J. Kunapuli S.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39493-39498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it is possible that activation of Rap1B by Gi participates in integrin activation in platelets. Unlike many other platelet agonists, thrombin-induced activation of Rap1B has been shown to occur in the absence of Gi stimulation (10Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 12Lova P. Paganini S. Sinigaglia F. Balduini C. Torti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12009-12015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast to what has been generally accepted for years, it has been shown recently that thrombin receptors do not couple directly to Gi (22Kim S. Foster C. Lecchi A. Quinton T.M. Prosser D.M. Jin J. Cattaneo M. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, thrombin-induced activation of Rap1B was found to be only minimally dependent on the binding of secreted ADP to the Gi-coupled P2Y12 receptor (10Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 12Lova P. Paganini S. Sinigaglia F. Balduini C. Torti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12009-12015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this context, the evidence that thrombin can induce platelet aggregation independently of Gi (22Kim S. Foster C. Lecchi A. Quinton T.M. Prosser D.M. Jin J. Cattaneo M. Kunapuli S.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 3629-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) is consistent with a role of Rap1B in regulating integrin αIIbβ3 activation. Thrombin is believed to activate platelets by binding to two G-protein-coupled protease-activated receptors, PAR-1 and PAR-4, in human platelets (23Kahn M.L. Zheng Y. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S. Farese Jr., R.V. Tam C. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 24Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Affinity for thrombin is higher for PAR-1 than PAR-4, and thus it is thought that platelet activation by low doses of thrombin is predominantly mediated by PAR-1 (23Kahn M.L. Zheng Y. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D. Moff S. Farese Jr., R.V. Tam C. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 24Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). PAR-4 has been suggested to sustain prolonged platelet activation by high doses of thrombin (24Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 25Covic L. Gresser A.L. Kuliopulos A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5458-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 26Covic L. Singh C. Smith H. Kuliopulos A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Both PAR-1 and PAR-4 are cleaved by thrombin at specific sites in the extracellular domain to unmask a new N-terminal sequence that binds to the body of the receptor and initiates transmembrane signaling (27Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Specific peptides reproducing the sequence of the new N terminus of activated thrombin receptors are potent and selective activators of PAR-1 and PAR-4 and have been shown to trigger all of the platelet responses elicited by thrombin (24Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 28Hung D.T. Wong Y.H. Vu T.K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20831-20834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, several findings indicate that, in contrast to thrombin, thrombin receptor-activating peptides are not full agonists for platelet activation and that the support of secreted ADP is necessary to achieve complete platelet response (29Lau L.-F. Pumiglia K. Cote Y.P. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Trumel C. Payrastre B. Plantavid M. Hechler B. Viala C. Presek P. Martinson E.A. Cazenave J.-P. Chap H. Gachet C. Blood. 1999; 94: 4156-4165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, maximal doses of PAR-1-activating peptide (TRAP-1) require secreted ADP to trigger irreversible platelet aggregation, whereas ADP scavengers inhibit platelet aggregation only at low, but not high, doses of thrombin (29Lau L.-F. Pumiglia K. Cote Y.P. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Trumel C. Payrastre B. Plantavid M. Hechler B. Viala C. Presek P. Martinson E.A. Cazenave J.-P. Chap H. Gachet C. Blood. 1999; 94: 4156-4165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, it has also been shown that the late activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase induced by TRAP-1 is dependent on secreted ADP (30Trumel C. Payrastre B. Plantavid M. Hechler B. Viala C. Presek P. Martinson E.A. Cazenave J.-P. Chap H. Gachet C. Blood. 1999; 94: 4156-4165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to PAR-1 and PAR-4, thrombin can also bind to platelet GPIb-IX-V (31Berndt M.C. Shen Y. Dopheide S.M. Gardiner E.E. Andrews R.K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This represents a high affinity receptor for thrombin, and a mounting body of evidence indicates that it may contribute to the activation of platelets (32De Marco L. Mazzuccato M. Masotti A.

Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 853-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It has been known for years that platelets from patients affected by the Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which lack GPIb-IX-V, show impaired response to thrombin (38Jamieson G.A. Okumura T. J. Clin. Investig. 1978; 61: 861-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Moreover, platelet activation by a low concentration of thrombin is affected by antibodies against GPIb-IX-V. More recently, it has been reported that binding of thrombin to GPIb-IX-V may initiate a new pathway for platelet aggregation that does not involve PARs and is supported by polymerized fibrin (36Soslau G.

Kieffer N. Reigner S.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 853-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Finally, stimulation of platelets with thrombin upon desensitization of both PAR-1 and PAR-4 still promotes phosphorylation of MAPK and activation of the Rho-dependent kinase p160ROCK (37Dubois C. Steiner B. Kieffer N. Reigner S.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 853-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting an active and direct role of GPIb-IX-V in thrombin-induced transmembrane signaling. In addition, it has been shown that GPIb-IX-V may contribute to platelet activation by increasing the rate of hydrolysis of PAR-1 (39De Candia E. Hall S.W. Rutella S. Landolfi R. Andrews R.K. De Cristofaro R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4692-4698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this work we have investigated the relative contribution of PAR-1, PAR-4, and GPIb-IX-V in thrombin-induced activation of Rap1B. We have found that selective stimulation of either PAR-1 or PAR-4, but not GPIb-IX-V, by thrombin generates signals for Rap1B activation. However, in contrast to thrombin, PAR-1- and PAR-4-promoted activation of Rap1B required the support of secreted ADP. We also found that the ability of thrombin to stimulate activation of Rap1B in an ADP-independent manner is conferred by co-stimulation of PAR-1 and PAR-4, as well as by binding to GPIb-IX-V. Materials—Sepharose CL-2B, GSH-Sepharose 2B, [14C]serotonin (57 mCi/mmol), and the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate were from Amersham Biosciences. Thrombin, apyrase (type VII), creatine phosphate, creatine phosphokinase, MRS2179, and mouse IgG were from Sigma. Fura-2/AM and Y-27632 were from Calbiochem. The thrombin receptor-activating peptide for PAR-1, SFLLRN (TRAP-1), and that for PAR-4, AYPGKF (TRAP-4), were custom synthesized by PRIMM (Milan, Italy). The rabbit polyclonal antiserum against Rap1B was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-GPIbα monoclonal antibody AK2 was from Serotec Ltd. PD98059 was from Alexis Biochemicals. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was from Bio-Rad. AR-C69931MX was a generous gift from AstraZeneca R&D (Charnwood, UK). Mocarhagin was a generous gift from Dr. M. Berndt (Monash University, Clayton, Australia). The cDNA for the Rap binding domain (RBD) of RalGDS was kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Bos (University of Utrecht, The Netherlands). Platelet Isolation and Stimulation—Blood was collected from healthy volunteers using citric acid/citrate/dextrose (152 mm sodium citrate, 130 mm citric acid, 112 mm glucose) as anticoagulant and centrifuged at 120 × g for 10 min at room temperature to obtain the platelet-rich plasma. Platelets were then recovered by centrifugation of the platelet-rich plasma at 300 × g for 10 min and resuspended in a small volume (0.5 ml) of autologous plasma. Platelets were then isolated by gel filtration on a 10-ml column of Sepharose CL-2B and eluted with HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 137 mm NaCl, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4). The platelet count was adjusted to 0.35 × 109 cells/ml with the same buffer for the Rap1B GTP binding assay. Human platelets deficient in the P2Y12 receptor were obtained from a previously characterized patient (40Cattaneo M. Lecchi A. Randi A.M. McGregor J.L. Mannucci P.M. Blood. 1992; 80: 2787-2796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and prepared by a washing procedure as described by Cattaneo et al. (41Cattaneo M. Zighetti M.L. Lombardi R. Martinez C. Lecchi A. Conley P.B. Ware J. Ruggeri Z.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1978-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In parallel, washed platelets were also prepared from healthy donors and used as an appropriate control. Platelet samples (0.5 ml) were incubated at 37 °C in an aggregometer under constant stirring and typically stimulated for 1 min with 0.1 unit/ml thrombin, 10 μm TRAP-1, or 1 mm TRAP-4 in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 unless otherwise stated. Neutralization of secreted ADP was achieved by incubating platelet samples with either 2 units/ml apyrase or 5 mm creatine phosphate and 40 units/ml creatine phosphokinase for 2 min before stimulation. The P2Y12 receptor was blocked by incubating platelets with 1 μm AR-C69931MX for 2 min before stimulation, while blockade of the P2Y1 receptor was achieved by incubating platelets with 200 μm MRS2179. In some experiments, platelets were incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-GPIbα monoclonal antibody AK2 or an identical concentration of unrelated mouse immunoglobulins for 2 min or were treated for 15 min with 15 μg/ml the GPIbα-cleaving protease mocarhagin before stimulation. For PAR-1 and PAR-4 desensitization, gel-filtered platelets were incubated for 60 min with 10 μm TRAP-1 and 1 mm TRAP-4 in the presence of 0.02 unit/ml apyrase with no stirring. Rap1B Activation Assay—Active GTP-bound Rap1B was precipitated from resting and stimulated platelets essentially as described by Franke et al. (10Franke B. Akkerman J.-W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) using the GST-tagged Rap binding domain of RalGDS (GST-RBD). Recombinant purified GST-RBD was coupled to GSH-Sepharose by incubating 200 μg of the protein with 100 μl of GSH-Sepharose (75% slurry) for 2 h at room temperature under constant tumbling. Platelet stimulation was stopped by addition of an equal volume of ice-cold modified 2× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm leupeptin, 0.2 μm aprotinin, 0.2 mm Na3VO4). Upon incubation on ice for 10 min, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the cleared supernatant (typically 50 μl) were withdrawn for subsequent analysis of the total amount of Rap1B in the lysates. GSH-Sepharose-coupled GST-RBD was added to the cleared platelet lysates (20 μg of GST-RBD/sample), and precipitation of GTP-bound Rap1B was performed by incubation at 4 °C for 45 min. The precipitates were collected by brief centrifugation, and the beads were washed three times with modified 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and finally resuspended with 25 μl of SDS-sample buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 4% SDS, 1% dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue). Precipitated Rap1B was separated by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% acrylamide gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The presence of active Rap1B in precipitates with GST-RBD was evaluated by staining the nitrocellulose filters with a specific polyclonal antibody against Rap1B used at a final dilution of 1:1,000. In parallel, equal amounts of total cell lysates were separated on a different gel and similarly analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-Rap1B antiserum to evaluate the amount of total Rap1B in the platelet lysates. The reactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. The presented figures are representative of at least three different experiments, except for the analysis of P2Y12 receptor-deficient platelets, which is representative of two different experiments performed with platelets from the same patient. Analysis of the total amount of Rap1B in the platelet lysates never revealed significant differences, and therefore, the results have not been included in the figures. Quantification of the amount of active Rap1B in the different samples was performed by densitometric scanning of the immunoblots using a CAMAG TLC scanner II. Measurement of Cytosolic Ca2+ Concentration—Platelets were prepared essentially as described above with slight modifications. Platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 3 μm Fura-2/AM at 37 °C for 30 min before further processing. Platelets were then eluted from the Sepharose CL-2B column with HEPES buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 5.5 mm glucose. The platelet count was then adjusted to 2 × 108 platelets/ml. Measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ was performed on 0.4-ml samples prewarmed at 37 °C under gentle stirring in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS3 spectrofluorometer in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. The fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 and 510 nm, respectively. Fura-2 fluorescence signals were calibrated according to the method of Pollock et al. (42Pollock W.K. Rink T.J. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Fmax was determined by addition of 2% Triton X-100 and saturating concentrations of CaCl2, whereas Fmin was determined by addition of 2 mm EGTA and 20 mm Tris base. All determinations were repeated at least three times with platelets from different donors. Measurement of [14C]Serotonin Secretion—Gel-filtered platelets at the concentration of 0.5 × 109 platelets/ml were labeled with 0.2 μCi/ml [14C]serotonin at 37 °C for 30 min. Platelets were then collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min in the presence of 5 mm EGTA and finally resuspended in HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, at the final concentration of 109 cells/ml. [14C]Serotonin-labeled platelets (0.1-ml samples) were stimulated with the appropriate agonist in the presence of 5 μm imipramine. A 10-μl aliquot was withdrawn before addition of the agonist to evaluate the total incorporated radioactivity. Stimulation was stopped by addition of 0.9 ml of 1.2% paraformaldehyde and 100 mm EDTA and by cooling on ice. Platelets were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min, and the radioactivity of [14C]serotonin released in the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The release of [14C]serotonin in the supernatant is reported as a percentage of the total incorporated radioactivity. Stimulation of PAR-1 and PAR-4 Triggers Activation of Rap1B—It is known that platelet activation by thrombin is mediated by two different protease-activated receptors, PAR-1 and PAR-4 (23Kahn M.L.

Parkin expression was inversely correlated with N-myc levels in the developing mouse and human brain, in human neuroblastoma cell lines with various levels of n-myc amplification, and in an inducible N-myc cell line. Although parkin and N-myc expression were dramatically altered upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation of a human neuroblastoma cell line, modulation of parkin expression did not significantly affect either rates of cellular proliferation or levels of cyclin E. Analysis of additional genes associated with familial PD revealed a shared basis of transcription regulation mediated by N-myc and the cell cycle.

Several genes have been identified that, when mutated, give rise to rare familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). 1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; UPS, ubiquitin proteasome system; SV40, simian virus 40; RT, reverse transcription; dox, doxycycline; PACRG, Parkin co-regulated gene.1The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson's disease; UPS, ubiquitin proteasome system; SV40, simian virus 40; RT, reverse transcription; dox, doxycycline; PACRG, Parkin co-regulated gene. Elucidation of the functions of the proteins encoded by these genes is likely to enhance understanding of the mechanisms underlying the more common sporadic form of the disease (1Hardy J. Cookson M.R. Singleton A. Lancet Neurol. 2003; 2: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The most common identified cause of familial PD is mutation of the parkin gene (2Lucking C.B. Durr A. Bonifati V. Vaughan J. De Michele G. Gasser T. Harhangi B.S. Meco G. Denefle P. Wood N.W. Agid Y. Brice A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1560-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Parkin protein functions in the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) as an E3-ligase capable of catalyzing the transfer of ubiquitin to target substrates (3Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar). Extensive efforts to identify parkin substrates have revealed numerous candidates, although a number of other studies have observed neuroprotective effects of parkin overexpression in cells simultaneously challenged with various insults (reviewed by Feany and Pallanck (4Feany M.B. Pallanck L.J. Neuron. 2003; 38: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)). Given the plethora of potential parkin substrates and numerous cellular pathways parkin might interact in, the timing and localization of parkin expression may be a critical feature of gene function. Parkin expression in the mammalian brain is largely neuron-specific and developmentally regulated, perhaps implying a role for parkin in neuronal maturation (5Kitada T. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6Wang M. Suzuki T. Kitada T. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Tanaka K. Mizuno Y. Hattori N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1561-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Evidence suggesting that the parkin gene is frequently mutated in breast and ovarian cancer (7Cesari R. Martin E.S. Calin G.A. Pentimalli F. Bichi R. McAdams H. Trapasso F. Drusco A. Shimizu M. Masciullo V. D'Andrilli G. Scambia G. Picchio M.C. Alder H. Godwin A.K. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5956-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 8Denison S.R. Callahan G. Becker N.A. Phillips L.A. Smith D.I. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003; 38: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) is noteworthy in this regard, because it raises the possibility that parkin may be intimately involved in cell cycle regulation, perhaps even functioning as an effective tumor suppressor in the periphery. Parkin protein may directly interact in the cell cycle as a component of a Skp1-cullin-F-box-like ubiquitin ligase complex capable of targeting cyclin E for degradation (9Staropoli J.F. McDermott C. Martinat C. Schulman B. Demireva E. Abeliovich A. Neuron. 2003; 37: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Disruption of cell cycle regulation could therefore be plausibly invoked as a mechanism leading to neuronal degeneration as a result of parkin dysfunction. To explore the nature of parkin's developmentally regulated pattern of expression and potential interaction in the cell cycle, we analyzed the parkin promoter for regulatory elements known to interact with transcription factors involved in cell cycle control. We identified a transcription regulation domain, conserved across several species, containing a sequence similar to an E-box motif, a promoter element known for interacting with the myc family of proteins. We demonstrate that parkin expression inversely correlates with expression of N-myc, a transcription factor critically involved in both neuronal development (10Knoepfler P.S. Cheng P.F. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2699-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and tumorigenesis (11Strieder V. Lutz W. Cancer Lett. 2002; 180: 107-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). N-myc also regulates transcription of other familial PD genes in an inducible cell line, thereby suggesting a common biological pathway among genes associated with PD. Cell Culture and Plasmids—SK-N-BE (2)-M17, SH-SY5Y, SK-N-F1, IMR-32, and SK-N-DZ cells were cultured in Opti-MEM media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For differentiation of SK-N-BE (2)-M17 cells, serum content was reduced to 2% and retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was included at a concentration of 1 μm. The N-myc-inducible cell line (also known as Tet-21/N or SHEP-21/N cells) was provided by Dr. J. Shohet (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) with permission from Dr. M. Schwab (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany). These cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, grown with or without doxycycline (dox; 1 μg/ml). The parkin-inducible PC-12 cell line was provided by Drs. F. Darios and A. Brice (Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Paris, France), and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% newborn calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 75 μg/ml geneticin, and hygromycin (50 μg/ ml), grown with or without doxycycline (1 μg/ml). Plasmids encoding the N-myc and max proteins in a mammalian expression vector were obtained from Dr. H. Kondo (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The vector pGL3-154, containing a portion of the parkin promoter, was described previously (12West A.B. Lockhart P.J. O'Farell C. Farrer M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Dual-luciferase Assay—Cells were plated 24 h before transfection into 24-well culture plates at ∼80% confluence, and transfection was performed with Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Biochemicals), using 0.2 μgof DNA per well in a 1:3 ratio of DNA/Fugene reagent, and added to cells in serum-free media for 12 h. Luciferase-containing constructs (pGL3) were co-transfected with pRL-SV40 renilla vector (Promega, Madison, WI) to control for transfection efficiency, in a molar ratio of 1:40 (pRL-SV40 versus pGL3 vectors). Forty hours after transfection, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested with passive lysis buffer (Promega). The dual-luciferase system (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol, and experiments were repeated in six wells. Readings were taken in duplicate on a Turner Designs 20/20 single injector luminometer (Promega). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The N-myc-inducible cell line was plated at 107 cells per 100-cm dish and cultured for 5 days in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline. Cultures were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked for 15 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing 1% formaldehyde. Media was then removed, and un-reacted formaldehyde was quenched by incubation in 125 mm glycine for 10 min at room temperature. Cultures were washed, and cells were collected by scraping into phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin B, and leupeptin). Cell pellets were re-suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 10 min. DNA was then sheared by sonication to an average size of 300 bp and samples were centrifuged. 0.2-ml supernatants from control and doxycycline-treated samples were diluted 1:10 with 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, and 16.7 mm Tris-HCl containing protease inhibitors, and 5% was set aside as input DNA. Samples were pre-cleared for immunoprecipitation by incubation with protein A-agarose blocked with 1 mg/ml of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. 5 μg of either rabbit anti-N-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or control IgG were added to each sample, and incubations were continued overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-agarose and washed with 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, and then 500 mm NaCl, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and finally Tris-EDTA. To simultaneously elute immune complexes and reverse cross-links, agarose-bound adducts were incubated overnight at 65 °C in 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and 0.2 m NaCl. Samples of Input DNA were made 0.3 m in NaCl and also incubated overnight at 65 °C. DNA was purified using the Qiagen PCR clean-up kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of the number of copies of parkin promoter DNA in input DNA, N-myc, or control IgG samples was performed on a Light Cycler system using Qiagen QuantiTect SYBR-Green PCR reagents and primers that flank the parkin promoter E-box sequence (forward, 5′-TAG AAC TAC GAC TCC CAG CAG GC-3′; reverse, 5′-CGG CTC TCC TGG GTT AAA TCC TC-3′). For each sample analyzing the parkin E-box sequence, copy number of parkin promoter DNA was determined by comparison to a standard curve composed of 100–10,000 copies of linearized plasmid DNA containing parkin promoter sequence versus the crossing-over point. Control primers amplifying 4 kb upstream of the parkin E-box sequence were also designed (forward, 5′-ACC TGT CAG CCT CTC TTG CAA CTA G-3′; reverse, 5′-CCC AGA AAC AGC AAT CCT CAC TCC-3′) in addition to primers that span the E-box sequence in the telomerase promoter (forward, 5′-AAG GTG AAG GGG CAG GAC GGC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAG TGG ATT CGC GGG CAC AGA-3′). All samples were assayed in triplicate, and N-myc and control IgG copy number were normalized with respect to Input DNA. Western and Northern Blot Analysis—Western blots were performed as described previously (13West A.B. Gonzalez-de-Chavez F. Wilkes K. O'Farrell C. Farrer M.J. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 341: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Antibodies to parkin (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), N-myc, and cyclin E (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used according to manufacturer's recommended conditions. In all experiments, a pre-stained molecular weight marker confirmed the expected size of the target proteins. For internal controls, the blots were stripped and reprobed with monoclonal antibodies against β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). Northern blotting was performed as described previously (12West A.B. Lockhart P.J. O'Farell C. Farrer M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To generate cDNA probes, primers specific to mouse parkin (forward, 5′-CAA CTC CCT GAT TAA AGA GCT CCA TC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGC TGA GGA CAC TTC ATG TGC ATA C-3′) and N-myc transcript (forward, 5′-GCT AGA GCG CGC AGT GAA CG-3′; reverse, 5′-CTG AGT CGC TGA AGG TAT CCT CTC C-3′) were used in a PCR reaction with mouse brain cDNA (BD Biosciences Clontech). Probes were radiolabeled and hybridized to a mouse embryo MTN blot (BD Biosciences Clontech) as described previously. Quantitative PCR—Quantitative PCR was performed as described previously (13West A.B. Gonzalez-de-Chavez F. Wilkes K. O'Farrell C. Farrer M.J. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 341: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In brief, the SYBR-green one step RT-PCR system (Qiagen) was used with an ABI 7900HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Total RNA derived from either a human 30-week-old fetal brain or adult whole brain was purchased (BD Biosciences Clontech), and primers specific for human parkin (forward, 5′-GGC TGG CTG TCA TTC TGC ACA C-3′; reverse, 5′-TCC CGG CTG CAC TCT TTG AC-3′), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (forward, 5′-GAA ATC CCA TCA CCA TCT TCC AGG-3′; reverse, 5′-GAG CCC CAG CCT TCT CCA TG-3′), N-myc (forward, 5′-GAG AGG ACA CCC 8 TGA GCG ATT CA-3′; reverse, 5′-ATG TGG TGA CAG CCT TGG TGT TGG-3′), α-synuclein (forward, 5′-GAA TTC TGG AAG ATA TGC CTG TGG ATC-3′; reverse, 5′-CAG CAG ATC TCA AGA AAC TGG GAG C-3′), UCH-L1 (forward, 5′-GGC CAC CTC TAT GAA CTT GAT GGA C-3′; reverse, 5′-AGC GGA CTT CTC CTT GCT CAC G-3′), and β-actin (forward, 5′-ATA GCA CAG CCT GGA TAG CAA CGT AC-3′; reverse, 5′-CAC CTT CTA CAA TGA GCT GCG TGT G-3′) were designed to span an intron/exon junction and used at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. Cell Proliferation Assay—To measure the rate of cellular proliferation, 3 × 105 cells were plated in replicate in 6-well dishes, with or without dox (1 μg/ml). At a given time interval, cells were harvested by trypsinization, collected by centrifugation, and then re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing trypan blue (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were manually counted on a hemocytometer by an investigator blinded to the identity of the culture, and cells that stained blue (<5% on average) were excluded. In addition, the One Solution cell proliferation assay was used according to manufacturer's recommended conditions (Promega). This assay uses the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrasodium bromide tetrazolium salt to measure metabolic activity, which correlates with the number of cells in a given sample. Identification of an Evolutionarily Conserved Potential N-myc Binding Sequence within the Parkin Promoter—We identified previously an E-box motif in the parkin/PACRG promoter 46 bp upstream of the parkin transcription initiation site that interacted with nuclear protein derived from human substantia nigra and overlapped with a region responsible for transcription regulation (12West A.B. Lockhart P.J. O'Farell C. Farrer M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To identify functional domains near the parkin E-box motif, we sequenced the parkin promoter in a number of evolutionarily divergent species using PCR primers placed in the more highly conserved exonic regions of the parkin and PACRG genes. As a whole, the parkin promoter displayed a conservation of 52% between human and mouse, in contrast to 83% conservation in the parkin open reading frame. We resolved a palindromic phyloprint (evolutionarily conserved promoter element) containing the E-box motif (CGCGTGCGC) 44 bp upstream of the parkin transcription initiation site (Fig. 1A). Using the MatInspector protein binding prediction program (www.genomatix.de), a number of proteins from the myc family of transcription factors were predicted to interact with the parkin promoter E-box, with highest similarity to the N-myc consensus binding domain matrix (Fig. 1B). The CGCGTG motif in the Pax-3 promoter has previously been shown to bind both N-myc and max in gel-shift assays (14Harris R.G. White E. Phillips E.S. Lillycrop K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34815-34825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The CGCGTG motif found in the parkin and pax-3 promoter differs from the canonical E-box sequence of CACGTG by 1 base pair, yet both sequences are known to strongly interact with myc-family proteins (15Blackwell T.K. Huang J. Ma A. Kretzner L. Alt F.W. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In humans and mice, neither the CGCGTG nor CACGTG sequence motif is repeated within 20 kbp of genomic sequence about the parkin promoter E-box. To determine the importance of the parkin promoter E-box and myc protein expression on transcription regulation, a DNA construct containing sequence from the first exon of parkin to the E-box sequence was inserted upstream of a promoter-less luciferase reporter gene in the pGL3-basic vector (pGL3-154). This plasmid was transiently transfected along with the control vector pRL-SV40 into the SK-N-BE (2)-M17 cell line, and strong transcription activation relative to control plasmid (pGL3-basic) was observed (Fig. 1C), as we have reported previously (12West A.B. Lockhart P.J. O'Farell C. Farrer M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To examine whether N-myc might affect this transcription activity, reporter assays were conducted in parallel with the overexpression of the N-myc transcription factor, max, or both N-myc and max. In all cases, the transcription activity of the parkin promoter construct was reduced; however, transcription activity of the SV40 promoter (pGL3-SV40) was not significantly affected, thereby suggesting activity in pRL-SV40, used to control for transfection efficiency, was also unaffected (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that N-myc repressed transcription activation in the parkin promoter reporter constructs. Parkin Expression Is Down-regulated by N-myc—N-myc-induced down-regulation of transcription in reporter assays does not necessarily convey a physiologically significant interaction in which N-myc regulates parkin expression. To determine whether modulation of N-myc expression alters endogenous parkin levels, we first examined parkin expression in an N-myc-inducible (tet-off) cell line. This cell line is of human SH-EP neuroblastoma origin and endogenously possesses a single copy of the N-myc gene, which expresses protein at very low levels (16Lutz W. Stohr M. Schurmann J. Wenzel A. Lohr A. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 803-812PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter constructs containing either the pGL3-SV40 control vector or the pGL3-154 parkin promoter vector were transiently transfected into the N-myc-inducible cell line. Control transfections with GFP demonstrated a low level of transfection efficiency in these cells (<5%, data not shown), however an increase in the transcription activity of the parkin promoter was observed when dox was included in the culture media (Fig. 2A). Next, parkin and N-myc mRNA was measured in the inducible N-myc cells grown for 1 week in the presence or absence of dox. Compared with levels of β-actin control mRNA, parkin mRNA was ∼5-fold less abundant in the cells grown without dox, a condition under which N-myc mRNA was increased more than 10-fold (Fig. 2B). We further confirmed the inverse relationship in expression of N-myc and parkin by measuring protein derived from the N-myc-inducible cells (Fig. 2C). N-myc Binds to the Parkin Promoter—To determine whether N-myc might be directly binding to the chromatin/nucleoprotein complex near the E-box sequence in the parkin promoter, we employed a chromatin immunoprecipitation strategy using the N-myc-inducible cell-line and a well characterized antibody directed against N-myc (Fig. 3A). PCR primers were designed to flank the E-box sequence in the parkin promoter, and quantification of precipitated DNA was achieved using a SYBR green fluorescence PCR system. In cells grown in the presence of dox, insignificant amounts of the parkin promoter were precipitated by a polyclonal antibody specific to N-myc, relative to IgG controls (Fig. 3, B–D). On the other hand, in cells grown without dox (and therefore high levels of N-myc; see Fig. 2, B and C), ∼18 times the copies of the parkin promoter were immunoprecipitated relative to cells grown with dox (Fig. 3C), thereby demonstrating that N-myc interacts with the chromatin complex at or near the E-box sequence in the parkin promoter. To further validate this system, we analyzed a region 4 kb upstream of the parkin E-box sequence in the parkin promoter that does not contain sequence similar to an E-bo, and would not be expected to immunoprecipitate with the anti-N-myc antibody. Insignificant amounts of DNA immunoprecipitated in cells grown with or without dox when normalized to IgG controls (Fig. 3D). We also analyzed a known N-myc binding site by designing primers that flank an E-box motif in the human telomerase gene. In agreement with a previous study (17Mac S.M. D'Cunha C.A. Farnham P.J. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 29: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), approximately seven times the amount of DNA precipitated from cells grown without dox versus IgG or cells grown with dox (Fig. 3D). Parkin Expression Inversely Correlates with N-myc during Development and in Human Neuroblastoma Cell Lines—Northern analysis of the amount of parkin and N-myc mRNA in poly-A purified RNA derived from mouse embryos showed parkin expression to be restricted to the latest stages of embryonic development (day 17), whereas N-myc expression was highest during mitotic stages of neuron growth (day 11; Fig. 4A), a finding consistent with previously published results (18Jakobovits A. Schwab M. Bishop J.M. Martin G.R. Nature. 1985; 318: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Zimmerman K.A. Yancopoulos G.D. Collum R.G. Smith R.K. Kohl N.E. Denis K.A. Nau M.M. Witte O.N. Toran-Allerand D. Gee C.E. Nature. 1986; 319: 780-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Likewise, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of fetal and adult human brain tissue showed that roughly double the parkin mRNA is present in the adult brain versus that of the fetal brain, measured relative to control mRNA (Fig. 4B). In addition to the developing mammalian embryo, N-myc expression is also highly variable in human neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma accompanied by amplification of the N-myc gene is associated with enhanced tumor aggressiveness and a poor clinical outcome (20Schwab M. Ellison J. Busch M. Rosenau W. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4940-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Most neuroblastoma derived cell lines have N-myc amplification; however, both the SH-SY5Y line and the SK-N-F1 line possess only a single copy of N-myc. Western blotting was used to measure relative parkin and N-myc expression in various neuroblastoma cell lines. Again, parkin expression inversely correlated with N-myc amplification (Fig. 4C). Retinoic Acid Up-regulates Parkin Expression—Retinoic acid is known to potently down-regulate N-myc expression and to induce growth arrest and differentiation in neuroblastoma cells (21Peverali F.A. Orioli D. Tonon L. Ciana P. Bunone G. Negri M. Della-Valle G. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 457-462PubMed Google Scholar). SK-N-BE(2)-M17 cells cultured for 10 days in media containing retinoic acid developed a complex network of cell processes indicative of differentiated and post-mitotic neurons (Fig. 5, A and B). Levels of N-myc and parkin were analyzed at days 3 and 10 of exposure to retinoic acid. N-myc mRNA decreased ∼20-fold at the day 10 (data not shown), whereas parkin mRNA doubled relative to control mRNA (Fig. 5C). Western blot analysis demonstrated an increase of parkin protein in differentiated cells relative to control proliferating cells and a corresponding decrease in N-myc and cyclin E protein (Fig. 5 D). Parkin Overexpression Does Not Affect Cellular Proliferation or Levels of Cyclin E—To determine whether parkin may play a role in the cessation of cellular proliferation, growth rates were measured, over the course of 96 h, in PC-12 cells that express inducible human parkin (tet-off system). Although the removal of dox in the N-myc-inducible cell line (thereby increasing N-myc expression) dramatically increased cellular proliferation (Fig. 6A, ▪ versus □), as has been previously reported (16Lutz W. Stohr M. Schurmann J. Wenzel A. Lohr A. Schwab M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 803-812PubMed Google Scholar), increasing parkin expression by removal of dox from the PC-12 cell media did not produce a significant change in cell growth rate (Fig. 6A, ▴ versus ▵). Cell growth rates were also measured using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrasodium bromide cell proliferation assay, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Parkin has been proposed to participate in the degradation of cyclin E, an important regulator of the cell cycle, via the ubiquitin proteasome system (9Staropoli J.F. McDermott C. Martinat C. Schulman B. Demireva E. Abeliovich A. Neuron. 2003; 37: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To determine whether modulation of parkin expression might affect endogenous levels of cyclin E, protein levels were measured in lysates derived from the parkin-inducible cells grown with or without dox. Modulation of parkin expression had no significant effect on levels of endogenous cyclin E protein relative to β-actin protein in this cell line (Fig. 6B). Soon after the parkin gene was identified, Northern analysis revealed a broad distribution of parkin expression in the brain (22Kitada T. Asakawa S. Hattori N. Matsumine H. Yamamura Y. Minoshima S. Yokochi M. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Nature. 1998; 392: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar), and parkin regulation was described as being akin to a class of genes with ubiquitous expression known as “cellular housekeepers.” Contrary to these original speculations, in-depth examination revealed a neuron-specific and developmentally regulated pattern of expression in the brain (5Kitada T. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Mizuno Y. Shimizu N. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6Wang M. Suzuki T. Kitada T. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Tanaka K. Mizuno Y. Hattori N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1561-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Given this background, and in light of the current heterogeneity of hypothesized parkin functions, further investigation into the regulation of parkin expression may divulge details of how loss of parkin function might cause PD and whether parkin might be involved in cancer. The parkin gene contains massive introns and spans a common fragile site (7Cesari R. Martin E.S. Calin G.A. Pentimalli F. Bichi R. McAdams H. Trapasso F. Drusco A. Shimizu M. Masciullo V. D'Andrilli G. Scambia G. Picchio M.C. Alder H. Godwin A.K. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5956-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), making it one of the largest genes in the genome. Yet despite a first intron >280 kbp in size, another expanded gene (PACRG) lies a mere 204 bp upstream of parkin, with domains of strong transcription activation in between (12West A.B. Lockhart P.J. O'Farell C. Farrer M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The first domain of transcription regulation upstream of the parkin transcription initiation site within the shared parkin/PACRG promoter contains sequence similar to an E-box motif (CGCGTG) that is electronically predicted to interact with myc-like proteins and is evolutionarily conserved. Harris et al. demonstrated that N-myc and Max protein can d"
https://openalex.org/W2059823994,"Mutations in Sir Antagonist 1 (SAN1) suppress defects in SIR4 and SPT16 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. San1 contains a RING domain, suggesting that it functions by targeting mutant sir4 and spt16 proteins for degradation by a ubiquitin-mediated pathway. Consistent with this idea, mutant sir4 and spt16 proteins are unstable in SAN1 cells but are stabilized in san1Δ cells. We demonstrate that San1 possesses ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity in vitro, and the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity of San1 is required for its function in vivo. Wild-type Sir4 has a half-life of about 21 min, and san1Δ increased Sir4 half-life to >90 min. In contrast, san1Δ did not affect the stability of wild-type Spt16, Sir3, Sir2, or the Spt16-associated proteins Pob3 and Nhp6. Loss of SAN1 also did not affect the stability of Ste6-166, a highly unstable protein in yeast. These results support the idea that San1 controls the turnover of a specific class of unstable nuclear proteins. Sir4 nucleates the assembly of silent chromatin at telomeres and the silent mating-type loci (HM) in S. cerevisiae. Sir4 can also affect silencing in the rDNA indirectly by sequestering limiting Sir2. Increasing the stability of wild-type Sir4 by deleting SAN1 had only subtle effects on silencing, suggesting that silent chromatin in yeast is robustly buffered against changes in Sir4 stability. Consistent with the idea that San1 participates as an accessory factor to regulate silent chromatin, including the silent mating-type loci, microarray analysis defined a small but statistically significant role for San1 in transcription of several mating pheromone-responsive genes. Mutations in Sir Antagonist 1 (SAN1) suppress defects in SIR4 and SPT16 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. San1 contains a RING domain, suggesting that it functions by targeting mutant sir4 and spt16 proteins for degradation by a ubiquitin-mediated pathway. Consistent with this idea, mutant sir4 and spt16 proteins are unstable in SAN1 cells but are stabilized in san1Δ cells. We demonstrate that San1 possesses ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity in vitro, and the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase activity of San1 is required for its function in vivo. Wild-type Sir4 has a half-life of about 21 min, and san1Δ increased Sir4 half-life to >90 min. In contrast, san1Δ did not affect the stability of wild-type Spt16, Sir3, Sir2, or the Spt16-associated proteins Pob3 and Nhp6. Loss of SAN1 also did not affect the stability of Ste6-166, a highly unstable protein in yeast. These results support the idea that San1 controls the turnover of a specific class of unstable nuclear proteins. Sir4 nucleates the assembly of silent chromatin at telomeres and the silent mating-type loci (HM) in S. cerevisiae. Sir4 can also affect silencing in the rDNA indirectly by sequestering limiting Sir2. Increasing the stability of wild-type Sir4 by deleting SAN1 had only subtle effects on silencing, suggesting that silent chromatin in yeast is robustly buffered against changes in Sir4 stability. Consistent with the idea that San1 participates as an accessory factor to regulate silent chromatin, including the silent mating-type loci, microarray analysis defined a small but statistically significant role for San1 in transcription of several mating pheromone-responsive genes. Transcriptional silencing of specific chromosomal domains results from the assembly of repressive chromatin structures composed of histones, Sir proteins, and specific DNA-binding proteins that are required for Sir protein recruitment (1Moazed D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Silent chromatin is also characterized by histone hypoacetylation and methylation in some organisms (2Richards E.J. Elgin S.C.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). There are three silenced chromatin domains in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Silencing at HML and HMR requires Sir1–4, whereas telomeric silencing requires Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 (3Haber J.E. George J.P. Genetics. 1979; 93: 13-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Klar A.J.S.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Silencing of RNA polymerase II transcription at rDNA requires Sir2 but not the other Sir proteins (8Smith J.S. Boeke J.D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 9Bryk M. Banerjee M. Murphy M. Knudsen K.E. Garfinkle D.J. Curcio M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The strength of rDNA silencing is determined by Sir2 protein levels, which are limiting in yeast (10Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1205-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, although Sir4 is not required for rDNA silencing, elevated levels of Sir4 impair rDNA silencing by titrating limiting Sir2 away from rDNA (10Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1205-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The competition for Sir2 among various silenced chromatin sites suggests that despite being stably maintained in a quiescent state, the constituents of silent chromatin are nonetheless in equilibrium. Silencing involves distinct establishment and maintenance phases. Establishment of silencing at HM loci is under cell cycle control and requires the Sir1 protein (11Pillus L. Rine J. Cell. 1989; 59: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 12Miller A.M. Nasmyth K.A. Nature. 1984; 312: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Sir2, Sir3, and Sir4 are required for both the establishment and the maintenance of the silenced state (13Ivy J.M. Klar A.J. Hicks J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 688-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Telomeric silencing is also influenced by the cell cycle such that it is stronger during G1/S and weaker during G2/M (14Aparicio O.M. Gottschling D.E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1133-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Sir3 and Sir4 are partially released from telomeres during G2/M (15Laroche T. Martin S.G. Tsai-Pflugfelder M. Gasser S.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 159-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and robust establishment of silencing at HMR is not achieved until cells fully traverse the cell cycle and enter the next G1 phase (16Lau A. Blitzblau H. Bell S.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2935-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transcriptional silencing is thought to result from the limited access of the transcriptional machinery to Sir-containing chromatin, which is generally inaccessible to DNA-modifying enzymes (17Gottschling D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4062-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Loo S. Rine J. Science. 1994; 264: 1768-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Singh J.

Nonetheless, DNA packaged into silent chromatin can be accessed by replication, repair, and recombination machineries (see Ref. 1Moazed D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 489-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar for review). Additionally, a transcriptional activator and the RNA polymerase II general transcription machinery can bind to silenced chromatin along with Sir proteins (21Sekinger E.A. Gross D.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The mechanisms regulating access of silenced chromatin are poorly understood. However, two recent reports (22Cheutin T. McNairn A.J. Jenuwein T. Gilbert D.M. Singh P.B. Misteli T. Science. 2003; 299: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 23Festenstein R. Pagakis S.N. Hiragami K. Lyon D. Verreault A. Sekkali B. Kioussis D. Science. 2003; 299: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) demonstrate that HP1, a major component of heterochromatin in vertebrate cells, is dynamically associated with chromatin in vivo, indicating that the repressive chromatin state in these cells does not result from generation of static, condensed DNA. Mutations in SAN1 can suppress mating defects in sir4 cells (24Schnell R. D'Ari L. Foss M. Goodman D. Rine J. Genetics. 1989; 122: 29-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the suppression caused by loss of SAN1 is not allele-specific, san1Δ cannot by-pass the requirement for Sir4 (24Schnell R. D'Ari L. Foss M. Goodman D. Rine J. Genetics. 1989; 122: 29-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of SAN1 does not affect SIR4 mRNA levels, suggesting that SAN1 functions by a post-transcriptional mechanism (24Schnell R. D'Ari L. Foss M. Goodman D. Rine J. Genetics. 1989; 122: 29-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in SAN1 also suppress a defect in CDC68/SPT16 (25Xu Q. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7553-7565Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here we report that San1 is a RING domain-containing E3 1The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; HA, hemagglutinin; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. ubiquitin ligase. Sir4 (wild-type and mutant protein) and mutant spt16 are turned over by a San1-dependent mechanism. These results describe a novel mechanism for turnover of unstable nuclear proteins in yeast and suggest that silent chromatin may be more dynamic than described previously. Plasmids and Strains—Plasmids carrying the wild-type SAN1 gene (pAD27), san1-W269A (pAD31), and san1-C165A (pAD32) were constructed by insertion of PCR-generated alleles of SAN1 into the HindIII and NotI sites of the CEN ARS URA3 plasmid pRS316 (26Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fragments contain the entire SAN1 open reading frame and 335 bp of 5′-flanking DNA. Plasmid pSIR4-URA carrying SIR4 in pRS316 was provided by Dan Gottschling. pLP305 (2 μm SIR4) and pLP754 (2 μm SIR4-42) were described previously (10Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1205-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A plasmid for bacterial expression of glutathione S-transferase-ubiquitin was provided by Jon Huibregtse, and plasmids expressing wheat E1 and human Ubc-H5B were provided by Allan Weissman. PCR was used to append five copies of the Myc epitope to the 3′ end of the full-length SAN1 gene, which was carried on pRS316. The San1-myc fusion protein was detected using the Myc-specific 9E10 monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution). Yeast strains used in the study are listed in Table I. Strains were constructed by disruption of the respective genes by single-step gene replacement in the indicated strains using PCR-generated DNA disruption cassettes. Appropriate targeting of the disruption cassettes was confirmed by PCR or by standard genetic crosses and tetrad analysis. A strain bearing the temperature-sensitive allele spt16-197 and the congenic wild-type SPT16 strain were provided by Fred Winston (27Malone E.A. Clark C.D. Chiang A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5710-5717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sir4-9 strain JRY50 (24Schnell R. D'Ari L. Foss M. Goodman D. Rine J.

Cell. 1993; 75: 495-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar), and full-length San1 were induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.6-1.0 for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were sonicated in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 using 1 ml of sonication buffer per 50 ml of induced cell culture. After sonication, the extract was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min in a Sorvall SS34 rotor, and the supernatant was stored in small aliquots at –80 °C. Ubiquitination assays were carried out using 20 ng of E1, E2, and/or E3 lysate in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm creatine phosphate, 15 units of creatine phosphokinase, and 1 μg of FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (Sigma) in a reaction volume of 30 μl (28Scheffner M.

Samples were boiled in protein gel loading buffer with dithiothreitol, resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:2000. Similar results were obtained when the assay was performed using radiolabeled glutathione S-transferase-ubiquitin and detection of reaction products by autoradiography (not shown; see Refs. 28Scheffner M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). For the experiment in Fig. 1C, the ubiquitination assays were carried out as above except that 2 μg of wild-type ubiquitin (FLAG-tagged), ubiquitin mutants having only Lys-6, Lys-48, or Lys-63 (Boston Biochem Inc.), or ubiquitin with all lysines mutated to arginine (Boston Biochem Inc.) were added to the reaction. The reactions were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the conjugated products were detected by Western blotting using the Py (polyoma virus medium T) antibody (68Schneider K.R. Smith R.L. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 266: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) to detect the N-terminal epitope tag on San1. Western Blotting and Analysis of Protein Turnover—To estimate the stability of specific proteins in the absence of new protein synthesis, wild-type and san1Δ cells were grown in YPD at 30 °C to an A600 of about 1.0. Cycloheximide was then added to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and aliquots of the cultures were removed at the indicated times. Harvested cells were washed with 200 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 400 mm ammonium sulfate, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin, 1.25 mg/ml N-ethylmaleimide, and 10% glycerol. Cells were lysed in the same buffer using glass beads and vortexing with intermittent cooling on ice. Extract proteins were resolved on 8 or 10% polyacrylamide protein gels except for detection of Nhp6 (15% gels). Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with antibodies to Sir2 or Sir4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Sir3 (kindly provided by Lorraine Pillus). Sir2 antisera was used at a dilution of 1:1000, and Sir4 antisera were used at 1:100 in TBST (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 154 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 50 μl of antifoam A per liter) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, followed by incubation with anti-goat secondary antibody (1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Santa Cruz Biotechnology Sir4 antisera directed against either the N or C terminus of Sir4 worked indistinguishably. Sir3 antisera were used as described previously (30Stone E.M. Pillus L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Spt16, Pob3, and Nhp6 were detected using antisera kindly provided by Tim Formosa and David Stillman. Spt16 antisera were used at a dilution of 1:10,000, Pob3 antisera at a dilution of 1:5000, and Nhp6 antisera at a dilution of 1:4000 in TBST containing 0.01% (α-Spt16) or 0.1% Tween 20 (α-Pob3, α-Nhp6) followed by incubation with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000, Amersham Biosciences). Plasmid-expressed HA-tagged Ste6-166 (31Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was detected by using 12CA5 HA antisera at a dilution of 1:3000. Detection of all proteins utilized the ECL+ kit (Amersham Biosciences) as recommended by the manufacturer. The amount of protein present at various times following cycloheximide addition was determined by densitometry, and kinetic analysis of protein stability was performed by fitting the data to exponential equations of the form Y = M0 × eM1×X using Kaleidagraph software. First order rate constants for the decay were determined directly from the resulting equations and were used to determine the t½ values. The quality of the fits was described by R values; the t½ and R values for the Sir4 data are reported in Fig. 3 legend. Metabolic Labeling—Metabolic labeling of yeast proteins was performed as described (31Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in synthetic dextrose media (supplemented with appropriate amino acids) to an A600 of about 1.0. Ten A600 units of cells (total) were resuspended in 2 ml of synthetic dextrose media and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min with shaking; cells were then pulse-labeled using 300 μCi of Express 35S-labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 10 min at 30 °C. Specifically labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography of gel-fractionated immunoprecipitates obtained by using polyclonal antisera raised against the protein of interest or antibodies directed against particular epitope tags as indicated. Under these conditions, radiolabeled HA-tagged Ste6 expressed from a gene carried on a 2-μm plasmid (31Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was readily detected (not shown). By using this protocol to detect Sir proteins (whose expression was driven by chromosomal copies of their genes), radiolabeled Sir2 and Sir3 were barely detectable, and radiolabeled Sir4 could not be detected by using either polyclonal antisera directed against untagged Sir4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or by immunoprecipitation of TAP-tagged Sir4 (32Hoppe G.J. Tanny J.C. Rudner A.D. Gerber S.A. Danaie S. Gygi S.P. Moazed D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4167-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) by using calmodulin beads. Metabolic labeling was used to determine the half-life of Ste6; the turnover of Ste6 was in good agreement with previously published data (31Loayza D. Tam A. Schmidt W.K. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2767-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Yeast Methods—Mating assays were performed by growing cells in patches overnight on YPD plates at 30 °C. The patches were then replica-plated to either YPD or lawns of mating tester strains on synthetic dextrose plates. Plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C prior to being photographed. For testing telomeric silencing, a tester strain was used that has URA3 located in the telomere on the left arm of chromosome VII (33Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Celic I. Kenna M.A. Muhammad S.

Overnight cultures of cells were grown on YPD or selective medium, and serial 10-fold dilutions of each strain were spotted onto synthetic complete medium or medium containing 1 mg/ml 5-FOA. For testing HM silencing, strains were used in which TRP1 is integrated at HMR, and cells were grown and serially spotted onto medium with or without tryptophan. Plates were photographed after incubation for 2 days at 30 °C. The HM tester strains used in Fig. 4 were derived from a strain missing the Rap1-binding site in HMR (hmrΔE::TRP1, see Ref. 35Enomoto S.

Silencing tester strains with deletions of CAC1, CAC2, or ASF1, which have been described previously (37Sharp J.A. Fouts E.T. Krawitz D.C. Kaufman P.D. Curr.

For testing rDNA silencing, strains were used with URA3 or MET15 reporter genes integrated in rDNA (10Smith J.S. Brachmann C.B. Pillus L. Boeke J.D. Genetics. 1998; 149: 1205-1219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, the SAN1 gene was deleted by single step gene replacement, and silencing was assayed in Fig. 4C by spotting cells on synthetic media with or without uracil. To determine whether mutations in the San1 RING domain suppress a defect in SPT16, cultures of wild-type and mutant cells were grown in YPD or selective medium at 30 °C. 10-fold serial dilutions of cells were spotted on YPD or synthetic medium without uracil (to select for the SAN1-containing plasmid as indicated in the figure). Plates were incubated at 30 or 34 °C (as indicated in Fig. 2) for 2 days.Fig. 2San1 RING domain is required for function in vivo. A, mutations in the San1 RING domain suppress sir4-9 mating defects. MATa sir4-9 san1Δ cells carrying wild-type SAN1 or mutant san1 alleles on low copy URA3-marked plasmids were grown as patches on synthetic complete media lacking uracil. The patches were then replica-plated onto YPD (left column) and onto a lawn of MATα mating type tester cells on a synthetic dextrose plate (right column). The wild-type strain was made by introduction of plasmid-borne wild-type SIR4 into the sir4-9 strain. Wild-type congenic (SIR4 SAN1) and san1Δ strains were included as controls.

C, mutations in the San1 RING domain suppress a defect in SPT16. Cultures of SPT16 or spt16-197 strains harboring the indicated plasmid-borne SAN1 alleles were spotted on synthetic media minus uracil and incubated at 30 or 34 °C. Growth of the congenic spt16-197 san1Δ strain is shown for comparison. D, wild-type and mutant San1 proteins were expressed at equivalent levels in yeast.

Wild-type Ccc2p and variants were expressed in a ccc2-Δ yeast strain to check whether they were able to restore copper transport by complementation. Wild-type Ccc2p and variants were also expressed in Sf9 cells using baculovirus to study their enzymatic properties on membrane preparations.

None of the variants was as efficient as the wild type in restoring copper homeostasis. The mutation of each cysteine of the 583CPC585 motif into a serine resulted in nonfunctional proteins that could not restore copper homeostasis in yeast and had no ATPase activity. Phosphorylation by ATP was still possible with the C583S variant, although it was not possible with the C585S variant, suggesting that the cysteines of the CPC motif have a different role in copper transport.

Copper is an essential element for living organisms because it is a cofactor for many enzymes. However, copper can also be toxic because of its redox properties and its ability to form free radicals. Therefore, all living cells from bacteria to plants and mammals have developed a fine control of their intracellular copper (1Peña M.M. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). In mammals, two P-type ATPases are responsible for delivering copper into the Golgi to newly synthesized proteins that need it as a cofactor, and also for expelling copper out of the cell, when necessary. The latter function is a response to an increase in intracellular copper and can be seen as a detoxification function when it occurs in the liver or an assimilation function when it occurs in the intestinal epithelium. In humans, the copper ATPases were named Menkes and Wilson ATPases after the related genetic diseases. The Menkes ATPase is expressed in almost all cells and mutations in its gene ATP7A result in a systemic lack of copper and severe neurological disorders; the Wilson ATPase is mainly expressed in hepatocytes and mutations in its gene ATP7B result in an overload of copper in the liver and cirrhosis (2Mercer J.F. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In yeast, there is one homologous P-type ATPase named Ccc2p, which delivers copper into the Golgi (3Fu D. Beeler T.J. Dunn T.M.

Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), and more precisely to the P1-type subfamily, which is specific for heavy metal transport (6Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The P1-type ATPases have a membranous domain made of 8 putative transmembrane segments and in the 6th transmembrane segment (TM6), 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; MOPS, 3-[N-Morpholino]propanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris propane, (1,3-bis[tris(Hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]propane); WT, wild-type; BCS, bathocuproine disulfonate; BCA, bicinchoninic acid.1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane; MOPS, 3-[N-Morpholino]propanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris propane, (1,3-bis[tris(Hydroxymethyl)-methylamino]propane); WT, wild-type; BCS, bathocuproine disulfonate; BCA, bicinchoninic acid. a conserved CPC/H motif (see Scheme 1 for Ccc2p). The cytoplasmic domain is made of two loops, the largest one containing the catalytic site, i.e. ATP-binding and phosphorylation sites. The N terminus comprises 1 to 6 metal-binding domains, each of them containing the CXXC consensus sequence, specific for heavy metal binding. Functional aspects of heavy metal transport by P1-ATPases have been gathered by various studies on prokaryotic cadmium, zinc, or lead ATPases (Staphylococcus aureus CadA (7Nucifora G. Chu L.

As depicted in Scheme 2, the ATPase is phosphorylated by ATP (step 2) after copper has bound to its membrane transport site(s) (step 1), whereas in the absence of copper, it cannot be phosphorylated by ATP, but rather by Pi (step 4) (22Walker J.M. Tsivkovskii R. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27953-27959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The ability of the metal to induce phosphorylation by ATP is a specific property of P-type ATPases, which allows to check whether or not the transport sites are filled with the metal to be transported. This property has been used to identify amino acids belonging to the transport sites of the Ca2+-ATPase (23Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H.

Assuming that among the 8 predicted transmembrane segments, some amino acids are arranged so as to coordinate copper, as described for calcium in the Ca2+-ATPase three-dimensional structure (36Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar), we have modified some of the highly conserved amino acids that could potentially form or participate at the copper transport site(s) and have evaluated the consequences of these modifications.In this report, the functional consequences of changing 8 conserved amino acids in TM3, TM4, TM5, and TM6, among them each cysteine of the CPC motif, were studied both in vivo by complementation assays in a ccc2-Δ yeast strain (i.e. a yeast strain in which the CCC2 gene was disrupted), and in vitro by measuring Ccc2p ATPase activity and phosphorylation by ATP on membrane preparations from Sf9 cells, after overexpression. We show here that (i) overexpressed Ccc2p in Sf9 cells has a measurable Cu(I)-dependent activity of 20 nmol/mg/min at 37 °C; (ii) all our mutations affected copper homeostasis in yeast, although to different extents; (iii) the mutation of each 583CPC585 cysteine impaired yeast growth as efficiently as the mutation of the phosphorylation site; (iv) each CPC cysteine is necessary to ATPase activity and (v) only Cys585 is necessary to ATP phosphorylation.Therefore, modification of the second cysteine in the CPC motif impairs ATPase activity because it impairs ATP phosphorylation, whereas modification of Cys583, the first cysteine, does not impair ATP phosphorylation. Thus, modification of Cys583 impairs other steps in the cycle. In other words, these two cysteines do not play the same role in the catalytic cycle.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESWild-type and Mutated CCC2 Gene—The genomic DNA from S. cerevisiae strain 288c was used to amplify the full-length CCC2 gene. The PCR product (3,015 bp) was subcloned into the pSP72 plasmid (Promega) using the StuI/XbaI sites provided by the PCR primers. The resulting plasmid was designated pSP72CCC2 and the DNA sequence was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (Genome Express). The CCC2 gene was then mutated to generate the desired codon changes corresponding to the following mutations: D337A, D374A, T375A, T541A, C583S, C585S, T591A, T593A, and the non-phosphorylating D627A mutant. The pSP72CCC2 was used as template to produce all the mutants by the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutated fragments were sequenced and subcloned into the CCC2 gene in replacement of the wild-type fragment in the pSP72CCC2 vector. Each mutant was further used and subcloned in the 2μ plasmid, using the EcoRI/AvrII sites. This plasmid, which contains the LEU2 selection factor and the PMA1 promoter, is denoted YEp181PALEH or YEp and used for expression in S. cerevisiae. The mutants were also subcloned in the pFastBac1 plasmid in the EcoRI/PstI sites for expression using the baculovirus/Sf9 system (Invitrogen).CCC2 Gene Disruption—The chromosomal CCC2 gene was disrupted by modifying the pSP72CCC2 plasmid with an insertion of the URA3 gene into the CCC2 coding sequence. This was done by excising with BamHI the URA3 gene from the YDpU vector (37Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and inserting the 1154-bp fragment into the unique BamHI site of CCC2. The 2549-bp SpeI/HindIII fragment containing the URA3 gene flanked at the 5′ and 3′ ends by 584 and 811 bp of CCC2 was used to transform the W303-1A S. cerevisiae strain. Yeast transformants were selected on Drop Out medium without uracil and their genomic DNA was prepared according to Ref. 38Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar for further checking by Southern blotting.Expression in Yeast and Complementation Assay—The transformed yeast strains were selected on Drop Out medium without uracil or leucine. They were grown on a yeast nitrogen base (YNB, without Cu,Fe, Q-BIOgene) supplemented with amino acids, except for leucine, and 1 μm CuSO4, 50 μm NH4(FeSO4)2·6H2O, and 1 mm ferrozine for 5 days at 30 °C (25Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1663-1674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Protein expression in yeast was assessed by immunodetection using anti-Ccc2GB, a polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the following peptide: 660CIKATESISDHPVSKAIIRY. Anti-Ccc2GB was used at 1:5000, and the protein was visualized using a chemiluminescence kit (Roche Applied Science). The same growth medium as described above was used for complementation in the presence of high copper (500 μm CuSO4) or in the presence of high iron (350 μm NH4(FeSO4)2·6H2O).Expression in Sf9 Cells and Membrane Fraction Preparation—Cultures of 120 ml (2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with recombinant baculovirus containing the wild-type or mutant CCC2 genes. Infection with the wild-type baculovirus was taken as control. After 3 days, the membrane fraction was prepared as described before (39Miras R. Cuillel M. Catty P. Guillain F. Mintz E. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 22: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) except for eliminating CaCl2 and adding 5 mm dithiothreitol. At the end, the membranes were suspended in 2 ml of storage buffer (100 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.0, 40% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C for further use. Protein concentration (∼20 mg/ml) was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Protein expression was assessed by SDS-PAGE and quantified by densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel (TotalLab, Amersham Biosciences). Ccc2p was also detected using anti-Ccc2GB.Phosphorylation by [γ-32P]ATP—50 μg of membrane fraction were suspended in 200 μl of 20 mm bis-Tris propane (pH 6.0), 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, according to Ref. 21Tsivkovskii R.

Unless otherwise specified, no copper was added to this medium. Radioactive [γ-32P]ATP was added to a final concentration of 5 μm (∼1500 cpm/pmol), and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for various periods of time as indicated in the figure legends.

The gel was exposed to PhosphorScreen and analyzed on a PhosphoImager (Amersham Biosciences) to measure the intensity of the phosphorylated bands. Isotopic dilution and ADP sensitivity experiments were carried out by adding non-radioactive ATP or ADP to the sample at various times after the reaction with 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP had started. The subsequent steps were the same as those described above. The effect of hydroxylamine was investigated on samples precipitated in trichloroacetic acid after phosphorylation. After the first centrifugation and washing in ice-cold water, a second centrifugation was followed by incubation for 30 min in 1.1 m hydroxylamine (pH 5.5) (41Caruso-Neves C. Rangel L.B. Vives D. Vieyra A. Coka-Guevara S. Lopes A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1468: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The samples were then prepared for the acidic gel as above.Phosphoenzyme Quantification—Each acidic gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to evaluate the relative amounts of loaded proteins in each lane and normalize [γ-32P] incorporation to the total loaded proteins. The protein band densitometry was analyzed by the Scion Image program. 3Available at www.scioncorp.com. This procedure allowed to quantify phosphoenzyme levels within the same gel, as shown for Ccc2p WT phosphorylation kinetics in Figs. 4 and 5. Each experiment was repeated 3–6 times with different membrane preparations and the maximal value on each gel, i.e. the Ccc2p WT phosphoenzyme level measured at 1 min was taken as 100%.Fig. 4Phosphorylation by ATP.A, different membrane preparations (50 μg of total membrane proteins): C0, D627A, and Ccc2p, as indicated. The reaction was initiated by adding 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP and carried out on ice at pH 6.0 for 15 s (lanes 1, 4, and 7), 45 s (lanes 2, 5, and 8), and 60 s (lanes 3, 6, and 9).

This was achieved by further using the 100% reference defined above for Ccc2p WT. Therefore, for each variant studied, all samples were analyzed on the same gel together with a sample of Ccc2p WT phosphorylated for 1 min.ATPase Activity—ATPase activity was measured according to the method described by Grubmeyer and Penefsky (42Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications for adaptation to our system (41Caruso-Neves C. Rangel L.B. Vives D. Vieyra A. Coka-Guevara S. Lopes A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1468: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, the assay buffer was 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.0), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ascorbate, 0.2% SDS-β-d-maltoside, 4% glycerol, and 10 mm NaF, the latter being necessary to inhibit Sf9 cell phosphatase activity. Note that no copper was added to this buffer. Membrane fractions (0.25 mg/ml) were first incubated for 30 min on ice in 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.0), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ascorbate, 10 mm NaF, and 20 μm thapsigargin to inhibit Sf9 cell Ca2+-ATPases. The reaction was started by adding 50 μl of the membrane suspension to 200 μl of the assay buffer supplemented with 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP and kept at 37 °C; it was stopped after various periods of time by the addition of HCl-activated charcoal (0.1 m). The 32Pi released was measured in an aliquot of the supernatant obtained after centrifugation of the charcoal suspension for 25 min at 4 °C and 18,000 × g. Spontaneous hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP was measured simultaneously by mixing the membranes and the acid before adding [γ-32P]ATP. Pi release increased linearly during the first 10 min; therefore, measurements were generally stopped after 5 min.Inhibition of ATPase Activity by Bathocuproine Disulfonate (BCS) and/or Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) and Reactivation by Copper—Membrane fractions (0.25 mg/ml) were incubated on ice with copper chelators in the following medium: 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.0), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10mm NaF, 20 μm thapsigargin, 250 μm BCS, and 100 μm BCA. After 30 min, the membrane suspension was spun down at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove the chelators, and the pellet was suspended in the assay buffer 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.0), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% SDS-β-d-maltoside, 4% glycerol, and 10 mm NaF for ATPase activity measurement in the presence of 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C. ATPase activity was measured 5 min later as described above. ATPase reactivation was obtained by incubating the pellet after the removal of the chelators for 30 min on ice in 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.0), 100 mm KCl, 5mm MgCl2, 10mm NaF, 0.2% SDS-β-d-maltoside, 4% glycerol, 100 μm ascorbate, and 10 μm CuSO4. It was then equilibrated at 37 °C and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP was added to start the reaction assay, which was stopped as described above.RESULTSThe Choice of the Amino Acids—To determine which amino acids may participate in the coordination of copper in the transmembrane domain, we first selected the acidic and polar residues of this domain, which are conserved in most of the Cu+-ATPases. Among them, we chose those that are identical in at least 10 of the 12 eukaryotic Cu+-ATPases known today. Table I shows the predicted transmembrane segments TM3 to TM6 of the eukaryotic Cu+-ATPases.2 The amino acids that were mutated in this work are in bold; they were replaced by alanines, except for the CPC motif in which the cysteines were changed to serines. The Cys to Ser substitution was chosen because it eliminates the thiol that is a preferential ligand for copper and also because a simple sulfur to oxygen change is hoped to have little effect on the structure of the protein.Table IComparison of eukaryotic copper ATPases transmembrane segments TM3 to TM6View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Complementation of ΔCCC2 (ccc2-Δ Yeast Strain) by Different CCC2 Variants—The modified proteins were studied in vivo using a complementation assay that detects whether or not copper homeostasis is impaired. In yeast, lack of Ccc2p impairs copper incorporation into the multicopper oxidase Fet3p and, therefore, the iron high affinity import complex Fet3p/Ftr1p cannot be activated at the plasma membrane. Consequently, a ΔCCC2 strain cannot survive under limiting iron and copper conditions (43Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Such a phenotype was evidenced in a medium deprived from copper and iron that allows the parental wild-type strain W303-1A to grow but not ΔCCC2 (Fig. 1A). Supplementing this medium with iron restored the growth of both strains that can take iron up through a low-affinity carrier (Fig. 1B); such recovery was also observed by supplementing the medium with copper (Fig. 1C). Therefore, in these experiments, the ΔCCC2 strain behaved as expected (43Yuan D.S. Stearman R. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), namely it could only grow in iron- or copper-rich media. This ΔCCC2 strain was further used for complementation studies based on the observation that the re-introduction of the CCC2 gene on a multicopy expression vector allowed recovery of the wild-type phenotype.Fig. 1Plating assay of W303 and ΔCCC2 yeast strains.Left panel, W303 and ΔCCC2 in three different media, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, selective medium containing 1 mm ferrozine, 1 μm copper, and 50 μm iron.

Here we assess the role of these “outsider” proteins in influenza virus hemagglutinin-mediated fusion between red blood cells and either hemagglutinin-expressing cells or viral particles. To selectively inhibit or enhance the actions of hemagglutinin outsiders, the antibodies that bind to hemagglutinin and proteases that cleave it were conjugated to polystyrene microspheres too large to enter the contact zone. We also involved hemagglutinin outsiders into interactions with additional red blood cells. We find the hemagglutinin outsiders to be necessary and sufficient for fusion. Interfering with the activity of the hemagglutinin outsiders inhibited fusion. Selective conversion of hemagglutinin outsiders alone into fusion-competent conformation was sufficient to achieve fusion.

The surface of the influenza virus particle is covered with molecules of hemagglutinin (HA), 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; HA-cell, HA-expressing cell; CPZ, chlorpromazine; CZ, contact zone; FP-AB, an antifusion peptide antiserum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FD, fluorescent dextran; NaBut, sodium butyrate; RBC, red blood cells; CF, 6-carboxyfluorescein; d, distance.1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; HA-cell, HA-expressing cell; CPZ, chlorpromazine; CZ, contact zone; FP-AB, an antifusion peptide antiserum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FD, fluorescent dextran; NaBut, sodium butyrate; RBC, red blood cells; CF, 6-carboxyfluorescein; d, distance. the fusion protein whose low pH-activated conformation drives fusion between the viral envelope and the membrane of an acidified endosome.

Biochem. 1987; 56: 365-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar) results in the delivery of viral RNA into the cytosol of the infected cell. A significant fraction (if not the majority) of HAs at the surface of the viral particle cannot interact directly with the membranes of endosomes and multivesicular bodies (4Matlin K.S. Reggio H. Helenius A. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 91: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Indeed, the intermembrane contact zone (CZ) usually involves only a fragment of the viral surface so that some of the HAs, referred to here as “insiders,” are situated inside the CZ, whereas the rest, the “outsiders,” have no access to the target membrane. However, both outsiders and insiders undergo similar restructuring at the pH of fusion (3Wiley D.C. Skehel J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 365-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). In this work, we tested the functional role of HA outsiders and found them to be required for driving the fusion toward the opening of an expanding fusion pore. HA-expressing cells (HA-cells) (X31 HA-cell HA300a (5Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and Japan HA-cell HAb2 (6Doxsey S.J. Sambrook J. Helenius A. White J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar)) were grown as previously described. In many experiments, HAb2 cells were pretreated with 9 mm sodium butyrate (NaBut) for 24 h to boost HA expression (7Danieli T. Pelletier S.L. Henis Y.I. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 8Markovic I. Leikina E. Zhukovsky M. Zimmerberg J. Chernomordik L.V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). If not stated otherwise, HA0 expressed at the cell surface was cleaved from HA0 to the fusion-competent HA1-HA2 form by trypsin (5 μg/ml, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) for 10 min at room temperature as described previously (9Chernomordik L.V. Frolov V.A. Leikina E. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We labeled human red blood cells (RBCs) with lipid dye PKH26 and with a content dye, 6-carboxyfluorescein (CF) or fluorescent dextran (FD) (10 or 70 kDa, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), using mild hypotonic lysis (9Chernomordik L.V.

Virology. 1997; 235: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All of the fusion experiments were performed at room temperature. HA-cells were incubated with RBCs for 15 min and washed three times with PBS to remove the unbound RBCs. If not stated otherwise, 0–2 RBCs were bound/HA-cell. To measure RBC binding to cells, we selected several areas of the dish and screened at least 200 cells to find the average number of RBC bound to each HA-cell. HA-cell/RBC pairs were bathed in low pH solution (PBS titrated with citrate) for a stated time. After the end of a low pH pulse, the extents of fusions (lipid and content mixing) were assayed by fluorescence microscopy as the percentage of dye-redistributed cell pairs (9Chernomordik L.V. Frolov V.A. Leikina E. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Restricted hemifusion was detected by chlorpromazine (CPZ) application after the low pH pulse as described previously (11Leikina E. Chernomordik L.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For experiments with multiple erythrocytes, we mixed labeled and unlabeled RBCs at a ratio of 1:10 using the same concentration of labeled RBCs as above. Each HA-cell had 0–2 labeled and 10–20 unlabeled RBCs bound to it. Influenza virus (Japan and X31 strains) was purchased from Charles River (Preston, CT) and labeled by membrane dye R18 as described by Hoekstra et al. (12Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The fusion of virus with RBC was assayed as R18 dequenching. In our work, we used several antibodies against HA. Rabbit antiserum (FP-AB) against the fusion peptide of HA recognizes low pH forms of both X31 and Japan HA strains (8Markovic I. Leikina E. Zhukovsky M. Zimmerberg J. Chernomordik L.V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies FC125 against neutral pH conformation of Japan HA were a gift from Dr. T. J. Braciale (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). The specific epitope of these antibodies has not been identified. LC89 and HC67 antibodies were both a gift from Dr. J. J. Skehel (National Institute for Medical Research, London, United Kingdom). HC67 antibody, with an epitope at residue HA1 193, binds only to the neutral pH form of X31 HA (13Daniels R.S. Douglas A.R. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1983; 64: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The binding site of LC89 antibody includes residue HA2 107 of X31 HA and is exposed only in the low pH form of HA (13Daniels R.S. Douglas A.R. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1983; 64: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 14Wharton S.A. Calder L.J. Ruigrok R.W. Skehel J.J. Steinhauer D.A. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We also used antibodies against the neuraminidase of influenza virus H3N2 (number 11-227, Clone ST9D2, Argene Inc., Massapequa, NY) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (Ab-1, Cat GR21, Oncogene Research Products, La Jolla, CA). Each of these antibodies, as well as thermolysin and trypsin (both proteases from Sigma), was conjugated with beads (FluoSpheres carboxylate-modified microspheres; blue-fluorescent microspheres with diameters of 20 nm, 100 nm, or 2 μm, Molecular Probes) as suggested by the manufacturer. The size of the beads was verified by quasi-elastic light scattering. Bead-conjugated agents were applied to prebound membranes either 5 min prior to a low pH pulse or immediately after it. In some experiments, to evaluate the tightness of the CZ, we used Quantum dots (Qdot 525 Streptavidin Conjugate, Quantum Dot Corporation, Hayward, CA) and streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Molecular Probes). Surface biotinylation of RBC (4% hematocrit) was performed with 1 mm EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate) (product 21335, Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 22 °C. Biotinylated RBCs were washed twice by a 4-min centrifugation at 1500 rpm. Confocal Microscopy—Live HAb2 cells with bound RBCs were analyzed using Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal scanning microscope (Zeiss, Germany). The microscope settings were as follows: excitation at 458 (in experiments with Qdot 525 streptavidin conjugate) or 488 nm (in experiments with streptavidin Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate); emission at 505LP into channel 2; Plan-Apochromat ×100/1.4 Oil differential interference contrast lens at an Airy disc setting of 2.0; and ×5 scan zoom. Serial images were taken, spanning a whole RBC with 0.71-μm steps. To obtain line-scan profiles, images were converted into 16-bit tiff files and further analyzed using the NIH ImageJ, version 1.31 software package (designed by Wayne Rasband). Electron Microscopy—HAb2 cells with bound RBCs were fixed, post-fixed through alcohol-acetone dehydration and epon-araldite infiltration steps, and thin-sectioned with Ultratom Leica Ultracut UCT (Leica, Austria). After staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, the sections were analyzed in a Philips CM-10 transmission electron microscope. The micrographs were analyzed to measure the dimensions of the CZ. In all of the sections, the diameter of the CZ was >90% of the maximum dimension of the RBC. Transmembrane distance (d) was measured uniformly every 40–50 nm along at least five independent CZs. NaBut pretreatment of the HAb2 cells and variation of the number of bound RBCs (single or >10/HA-cell) changed neither the area of the CZ nor the mean d (for instance, d = 13.5 ± 7 and 12 ± 3 nm for RBC at either HAb2 or NaBut-treated HAb2 cells). Experimental Approach—To study the functional role of HA outsiders, we have focused on the experimental system of HA-cell/RBC fusion, which is particularly convenient for several reasons. First, the pathway of low pH-triggered fusion can be followed here as the transfer of membrane and aqueous dyes from prelabeled RBCs to HA-cells (5Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 9Chernomordik L.V. Frolov V.A. Leikina E. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J.

Second, the HA-cell/RBC fusion can be manipulated by anti-HA antibodies (16Leikina E. LeDuc D.L. Macosko J.C. Epand R. Shin Y.K. Chernomordik L.V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8378-8386Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Stegmann T. White J.M. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4231-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and by proteases such as trypsin and thermolysin (Ref. 9Chernomordik L.V. Frolov V.A. Leikina E. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar and references therein). Finally, as seen in Fig. 1, A and B, HA-cells and bound RBCs establish the extended CZ with an area on the order of tens of square microns (see also Refs. 6Doxsey S.J. Sambrook J. Helenius A. White J. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Danieli T. Pelletier S.L. Henis Y.I. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 18Frolov V. Cho M.-S. Bronk P. Reese T. Zimmerberg J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) that are characterized by a relatively constant intermembrane distance of ∼13 nm close to the height of the HA ectodomain (3Wiley D.C. Skehel J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 365-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Readily distinguishable pools of insider and outsider HAs in this system facilitate the characterization of their relative fusogenic activity. To differentiate between the fusogenic actions of the insider and the outsider HAs, we subjected the latter to different binding and cleaving agents while leaving the former intact. To achieve this selective effect, we conjugated different antibodies and proteases to polystyrene beads of diameters significantly exceeding the 13-nm transmembrane distance in the CZ. If not stated otherwise, we used beads of 20 nm in diameter. Using fluorescence microscopy, we verified that fluorescent 20-nm beads with conjugated HC67 antibody added to X31 HA-cells with prebound RBCs are excluded from the CZ (Fig. 1C). HA-cell/RBC pairs were incubated with bead-antibodies for 15 min and then washed to remove unbound beads. Whereas HA-cell was fluorescent because of bound beads, a patch of an HA-cell under bound RBC (arrow in Fig. 1C) was seen as a non-fluorescent black patch. The tightness of the CZ and its inaccessibility for macromolecules within the 5-min time relevant for our experiments were confirmed further by another experimental approach. We surface-biotinylated RBCs and brought them into contact with Japan HA-cells. HA-cell/RBC pairs were then incubated with fluorescent streptavidin. Finally, we removed unbound streptavidin by washing and analyzed HA-cell/RBC pairs under confocal microscopy. In this experiment, we chose to biotinylate and thus label RBC rather than HA-cell because this gives more homogeneous labeling. When HA-cell/biotinylated RBC pairs were incubated with fluorescent streptavidin for 1-h, most of the CZs demonstrated significant fluorescence (Supplemental Fig. 1S). In contrast, after a 15-min incubation, the fluorescence of the CZ was <2.5% that of the RBC membrane outside of the CZ (Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, at the times relevant for our experiments (5-min incubations with bead-agents that give fusion inhibition and promotion described below), the tightness of the CZ restricts the entry even for a free 60-kDa protein. Using similar approach, we also found the CZ inaccessible for the smallest Quantum dots (Qdot 525 streptavidin conjugate) (Supplemental data, Fig. 2S). According to the manufacturer, these Qdots have the effective average diameter of <8 nm. HA-cell/biotinylated RBC pairs were incubated with the Quantum dots for 30 min. After the removal of unbound Qdots, we found CZ fluorescence indistinguishable from the background and <2.5% of the fluorescence of RBC membrane outside of the CZ. Thus, after relevant incubation times, the smallest Qdots and even a 60-kDa streptavidin cover <2.5% of the CZ area, indicating that the proteins conjugated to 20-nm beads might interact directly only with a negligible fraction of HA insiders. To evaluate whether the effects observed after application of bead-conjugated agents were specific for HA of a particular strain of influenza virus or instead reflected more general properties of HA fusion, we used cells expressing HA of two different influenza subtypes, H3 (A/Aichi/2/68:X31 strain) and H2 (A/Japan/305/57 strain), which differ in their patterns of activation (8Markovic I. Leikina E. Zhukovsky M. Zimmerberg J. Chernomordik L.V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Puri A. Booy F.P. Doms R.W. White J.M. Blumenthal R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3824-3832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the HA0 form of HA expressed on HA-cells is fusion-incompetent, if not stated otherwise prior to our experiments, HA0 was trypsin-cleaved in the fusion-competent HA1-HA2 form. As expected in all of the experiments presented below, neither lipid nor content mixing was observed when HA-cell/RBC complexes were not treated with low pH. HA Outsiders Are Necessary for Fusion—We interfered with the HA outsiders by incubating pairs of RBCs and HA-cells with bead-conjugated HA-inhibiting agents applied either before or after low pH treatment. We used antibodies against low pH forms of HA (FP-AB that recognizes both X31 and Japan HA as well as LC89 antibodies against the X31 strain of HA), antibodies against neutral pH HA (HC67 and FC125 antibodies against the X31 and Japan strains of HA, respectively), and thermolysin, which cleaves only low pH forms of HA of both the X31 and Japan strains (8Markovic I. Leikina E. Zhukovsky M. Zimmerberg J. Chernomordik L.V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The bead-antibodies (bead-FP-AB and bead-LC89 antibodies) against low pH forms of HA inhibited the mixing of both lipids and contents of the fusing cells. The specificity of the inhibition corresponded to the specificity of our bead-agents. Inhibition was observed only when the agents were applied to low pH-treated X31 HA-cell/RBC pairs (Fig. 2A). The pairs were incubated with the bead-antibodies immediately after the low pH pulse. Fusion inhibition by bead-FP-AB applied after the low pH pulse was observed not only for the 20-nm beads but also for the 100-nm beads (Fig. 2B). Since by the time the inhibiting agents were added the fusion had already commenced, the inhibition seen in Fig. 2, A and B, reflects both the effectiveness of the bead-inhibitors and the rapidness of their action. Bead FP-AB similarly inhibited Japan HA-mediated fusion. For Japan HA-cell/RBC pairs treated with a 1-min pulse of pH 4.9, bead-FP-AB applied immediately after low pH pulse inhibited lipid mixing from 49.8 ± 6.4 to 5.1 ± 1.7% and content mixing, assayed as CF redistribution, from 19.2 ± 2.9 to 0% (n ≥ 3). Bead-antibodies against neutral pH HA inhibited fusion when added to the cells prior to a low pH pulse (shown in Fig. 2, C and D, for bead-FC125 antibody and Japan HA-cells). Similar results were observed for bead-HC67 antibody and X31 HA (Supplemental Fig. 3S). Importantly, fusion inhibition by bead-HC67 antibody was not accompanied by any decrease in the number of bound RBCs. After a 30-min incubation of X31 HA-cell/RBC pairs with bead-HC67 antibody, we found 0.21 bound RBC/HA-cell versus 0.2 bound RBC/HA-cell in the experiment with no beads added. In another control experiment, the application of bead-HC67 antibody to HA-cells prior to adding RBCs inhibited subsequent RBC binding to 0.02 bound RBC/HA-cell. In Fig. 2C, we varied the time of the preincubation of the Japan HA-cell/RBC pairs with the bead-FC125 antibody to test whether the inhibition can be explained by gradual extraction of HAs from the CZ driven by HA-antibody interactions. The lack of any increase in the inhibition of the content mixing when the time of the preincubation was increased from 5 to 60 min argues against this hypothesis. The specificity of the inhibition was confirmed by the experiments in which neither lipid nor content mixing was affected by treatment of RBC/HA-cell pairs with protein-free beads and with beads conjugated with immunoglobulins of the preimmune serum (for instance, bars 3 in Fig. 2A). The fusion also was unaffected when beads with antibodies to HA were replaced with beads conjugated with antibodies against one of the abundant surface proteins of the HAb2 cells, the fibroblast growth factor receptor (Supplemental Fig. 4S). To control for the possibility that the free agents released from the beads cause the inhibition, we also verified that treatment with supernatant from the fusion-inhibiting bead-agents did not change the fusion efficiency (for instance, bars 4 and 6 in Fig. 2A). Different fusion phenotypes have different sensitivity to bead-FC125 antibody (Fig. 2D). Content mixing between Japan HA-cell and RBC was strongly inhibited by the bead-FC125 antibody. Lipid mixing, which can be observed even in the absence of content mixing (the “hemifusion” phenotype (5Kemble G.W. Danieli T. White J.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar)), was less sensitive to the bead-agents. Finally, bead-FC125 antibody did not suppress the early fusion phenotype referred to as “restricted hemifusion” and detected by its transformation into complete fusion with agents such as CPZ that break the hemifusion structures (9Chernomordik L.V. Frolov V.A. Leikina E. Bronk P. Zimmerberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1369-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 11Leikina E. Chernomordik L.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 20Melikyan G.B. Brener S.A. Ok D.C. Cohen F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 995-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Because the number of low pH-activated HAs required to establish given fusion phenotype increases from restricted hemifusion to lipid mixing to content mixing (11Leikina E. Chernomordik L.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we conclude that more advanced fusion phenotypes are more dependent on HA outsiders. A similar relative potency of the bead-inhibitor on different fusion phenotypes, i.e. strong inhibition for content mixing and no effect on restricted hemifusion, was also observed for X31 HA-mediated fusion (Fig. 2B). Surface density of HA in the stable cell lines used in the experiments shown in Fig. 2, A–D, is significantly lower than that in viral particles (7Danieli T. Pelletier S.L. Henis Y.I. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 21Taylor H.P. Armstrong S.J. Dimmock N.J. Virology. 1987; 159: 288-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Does fusion at higher densities still depend on HA outsiders? A very high density of HAs (∼12 × 103 trimers/μm2) can be achieved by the preincubation of Japan HA-cells with NaBut (7Danieli T. Pelletier S.L. Henis Y.I. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 8Markovic I. Leikina E. Zhukovsky M. Zimmerberg J. Chernomordik L.V. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Lipid mixing between these HA-cells and prebound RBCs was very robust and almost insensitive to the bead-thermolysin. However, the content mixing assayed as the transfer of either CF or 10-kDa FD was inhibited strongly when the bead-thermolysin was applied after but not before a low pH pulse (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows a similar inhibition of 10-kDa FD transfer by the bead-FC125 antibody. However, in contrast to the bead-thermolysin, the bead-FC125 antibody inhibited fusion only when applied before low pH pulse. This difference was expected taking into account that while thermolysin interacts with the low pH form of HA, FC125 antibody interacts with neutral pH HA. Fusion inhibition by bead-conjugated FC125 antibody also was observed in the fusion of RBC with influenza virus (Japan strain) particles where HA density is close to the maximum level allowed by the size of HA (∼15 × 103 trimers/μm2). Because leakiness of the fusion of viral particles hinders the application of content-mixing assays (22Shangguan T. Alford D. Bentz J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4956-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), virus/RBC fusion was measured as lipid mixing, which as shown above is less sensitive to bead-agents than content mixing. Indeed, at pH 4.9, because of an excess of fusion-competent HAs, lipid mixing was very robust and insensitive to inhibiting agents. However, at pH 5.3, we observed a statistically significant ∼35% inhibition of fusion (Fig. 3, C and D). In our experiments on the viral particles of X31 strain, we observed a similar inhibition. We also found that, in contrast to the bead-conjugated antibodies to HA, beads coupled with antibodies to another glycoprotein of influenza virus envelope, the neuraminidase, had no effect on the rate of lipid mixing (Supplemental Fig. 5S). Relatively small bead-agents can approach the edge of the CZ. In contrast, an RBC cannot possibly get close to the CZ between another RBC and an HA-cell. Additional RBCs bound to the same HA-cell can play the role of extra large (∼6 μm) HA-binding beads. If HA outsiders are indeed functional, fusion between an HA-cell and a particular RBC can be inhibited if additional RBCs are bound to the HAs of the same cell. To test this prediction, we compared the fusion between HA-cell and a single labeled RBC when this labeled RBC was the only RBC bound to the cell with the fusion observed when, in addition to a single labeled RBC, HA-cell was covered with many unlabeled RBCs (Fig. 4). To minimize the possibility that the binding of additional RBCs decreased HA density in the CZ between the labeled RBC and the HA-cell, we used NaBut-pretreated HA-cells. Although crowding RBCs around HA-cells did not affect redistributions of our lipid probe and a small aqueous dye CF, which are very robust at high HA densities, it clearly inhibited the fusion assayed as the transfer of larger aqueous probes such as FD of 10 kDa and especially 70 kDa (Fig. 4A). Thus, the larger the pores, the stronger were the inhibiting effects of additional RBCs. Interestingly, the inhibition of fusion pore expansion by the additional RBCs also radically changed the morphology of the fusion product (Fig. 4B). In contrast to fusion with a single bound RBC resulting in a quick flattening of the RBC membrane, additional RBCs stabilized the configuration in which the fused RBCs with redistributed membrane dye remained clearly distinct rather than fully flattened. In contrast to bead-conjugated agents, additional RBCs not only interact with HA outsiders but also fuse with HA-cell and thus provide additional membrane area. To verify that the latter effect is not required for the observed inhibition of fusion pore expansion, we replaced additional RBCs with large 2-μm-diameter beads. NaBut-pretreated Japan HA cells with bound RBC (0–2 RBCs/HA-cell) were incubated with 2-μm-diameter polystyrene beads with conjugated FC125 antibodies for 10 min and then treated with a 1-min pulse of pH 4.9. The application of these very large beads with conjugated antibody decreased the content mixing (10-kDa FD) extent to 44.8 ± 5.8 versus 79 ± 7.8% in the control experiment with no beads added, and 83.8 ± 6.6% (n > 3) in the control experiment were HA-cell/RBC pairs were preincubated with the supernatant from the beads rather than with the beads themselves. The effects of the additional RBCs and FC125 antibody conjugated to very large beads indicate that direct interaction between HA-binding agents and HAs located at the very edge of the CZ is not required for the fusion inhibition. In summary, fusion inhibition by the agents too large to enter the CZ indicates that HA outsiders are required for the transition from early fusion intermediates to an expanding fusion pore. For bead-conjugated HA-targeting agents and for additional RBCs, fusion inhibition was never complete, suggesting either that fusion depends only partially on the presence of HA outsiders or that, very likely, fusogenic activity of HA outsiders was never blocked fully by our inhibiting agents. HA Outsiders Are Sufficient for Fusion—To test whether HA outsiders are sufficient for fusion, we kept HAs inside the CZ fusion incompetent. As mentioned above, prior to low pH application, HA expressed at the surface of HA-cells has to be cleaved by trypsin from the HA precursor HA0, which is competent for receptor binding but not for fusion, into the fusogenic HA1-HA2 form (3Wiley D.C. Skehel J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 365-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). NaBut-pretreated cells with uncleaved HA0s were brought into contact with RBCs and then incubated for 2 min with bead-trypsin to selectively bring HA outsiders into the fusion-competent form. Surprisingly, a 5-min and even a 2-min low pH pulse applied immediately after the beadtrypsin treatment produced robust fusion (Fig. 5). These results indicated that the HA outsiders are sufficient for fusion. In many examples of ubiquitous protein-mediated membrane fusion reactions, only a fraction of all fusion proteins is located in the immediate vicinity of the target membrane. In this work, we show that prototype fusion reaction, fusion mediated by HA, depends not only on HAs, which at the time of low pH application were present in the CZ, but also on HAs located outside of the CZ. Interfering with the activity of HA outsiders by different HA-binding and cleaving agents (antibodies and proteases conjugated to beads of 20-nm, 100-nm, and 2-μm diameter and additional RBCs) that were too large to enter the CZ within relevant times inhibited the transition from early fusion intermediates to an expanding fusion pore in the fusion mediated by HAs of two divergent influenza subtypes. Selective conversion of HA outsiders alone into fusion-competent conformation produced fusion. These findings indicate that HA outsiders are required and may be sufficient for fusion. Functional Role of HA Outsiders—What may be the mechanism of the bead-agent modulation of fusion? This modulation cannot be explained by nonspecific covering of the HA-cell surface with bound beads. Control beads conjugated with preimmune serum did not affect fusion even when there were three times more beads bound per HAb2 cell than in the case of fusion-inhibiting bead-antibodies (assayed as cell-associated fluorescence). In addition, the inhibition induced by the covering of the surface would not explain why bead-thermolysin inhibits fusion only when applied after a low pH pulse and why bead-trypsin promotes fusion. Another possibility is that fusion modulation by the bead-agents involves changes in the number and/or properties of the HA insiders mediated by an exchange of HAs between the CZ and the surrounding HA-cell membrane. Fusion inhibition by replacing HA insiders with thermolysin-cleaved fusion-incompetent HA outsiders would imply that functional fusion machines are formed by a dynamic assembly of HAs initially spread over very large area of the membrane. However, kinetic considerations argue against this mechanism. The agents that target HA outsiders act very fast. For instance, under the experimental conditions in Fig. 3A, content mixing reaches final extents within 2 min. Still bead-thermolysin, added already after the first minute at pH 4.9, greatly inhibited content mixing. This leaves a rather limited time for the exchange between HA outsiders and insiders, most of which are expected to be bound to the receptors on the RBCs (23Leikina E. Markovic I. Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1415-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Mittal A. Bentz J. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1521-1535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and thus probably have greatly reduced mobility (25Jacobson K.A. Moore S.E. Yang B. Doherty P. Gordon G.W. Walsh F.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1330: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Low pH application additionally decreases mobility of activated HAs (26Gutman O. Danieli T. White J.M. Henis Y.I. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Fusion inhibition by the bead-antibodies against the neutral pH form of HA also cannot be explained by a specific HA-exchange mechanism, which suggests that bead-antibodies shift the equilibrium distribution between the insider and outsider HAs and, in effect, extract the insiders from the CZ. Because HA mediates binding between HA-cells and receptors at RBC, extraction of the HAs from the CZ should result in a decrease of this binding. However, we observed no decrease in the number of bound RBCs after 30 min of incubation of X31 HA-cell/RBC pairs with bead-HC67 antibody. Furthermore, any extraction of HAs from the CZ to allow them to interact with the antibodies or additional RBCs should increase the surface density of HA outsiders. When the initial HA density cannot be increased, such HA redistribution is impossible. Therefore, our finding that bead-antibodies and additional RBCs inhibit fusion even at the surface densities of HA close to the maximum density allowed by the size of HA argue against HA extraction as a possible basis for the effects of bead-conjugated fusion-inhibiting agents. Finally, the assumption that bead-antibodies inhibit fusion by lowering the number of HA insiders is inconsistent with our finding that longer preincubation of HA-cell/RBC pairs with bead-antibodies against the neutral pH form of HA, aimed at allowing HA insiders more time to leave the CZ, did not result in stronger inhibition of fusion (Fig. 2C). This finding indicates that either HA insiders and outsiders do not exchange in the relevant time or, assuming that mobility of HA insiders is not hindered by HA-receptor interactions, that fusion is insensitive to significant changes in the numbers of extracted insiders (10-fold difference in the number of HA insiders between the experiments with 5- and 60-min-long preincubations as estimated for the CZ of a 3-μm radius and the lateral mobility of HA in the absence of the target membrane ∼3 × 10-10 cm2/s (7Danieli T. Pelletier S.L. Henis Y.I. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)). Similarly, the lack of the increase in fusion extents upon extension of the time interval between bead-trypsin and low pH applications from 2 to 30 min (Fig. 5) argues against the HA-exchange interpretation of the bead-trypsin experiments. If trypsin-cleaved HA outsiders enter CZ by lateral diffusion and then upon low pH application mediate fusion from there, fusion efficiency has to be insensitive to an ∼9-fold difference in the number of HA insiders. Because the evidence indicates that the exchange mechanisms cannot explain fusion modulation by the HA outsider-targeting agents, we conclude that the fusion protein outsiders directly influence the most energy-intensive stages of fusion leading to the opening and expansion of a fusion pore. The observation that the formation of early fusion intermediates such as restricted hemifusion is not affected by the HA outsider-targeting agents might indicate that fusion involves two radically different activities of the same fusion protein HA. The local action of HA insiders generates local hemifusion. In this scenario, in the absence of fusion-competent HA insiders as in the experiment shown in Fig. 5, local hemifusion can develop only at the rim of the CZ. Later fusion stages yielding the expanding fusion pore are driven by HAs located outside of the initial fusion site. The achieved fusion phenotype might depend on the total number of activated HAs including both insiders and outsiders. At the highest HA densities, only the most advanced fusion stage, an expansion of fusion pore, depends on HA outsiders and is inhibited by our bead-agents. For lower density of activated HAs, outsiders are required even for lipid mixing. The functional role of HAs, which at the time of the low pH application are located outside of the CZ, goes against the accepted view that fusion is a highly localized phenomenon driven only by a few fusion proteins in the CZ that directly interact with the target membrane. At the same time, our results rationalize the interesting findings that the entry of many viruses (27Edwards M.J. Dimmock N.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10208-10218Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and exocytotic fusion (28Whalley T. Sokoloff A. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) are inhibited by macromolecules, which are added to predocked membranes and are apparently too large to rapidly enter the tight CZ. A functional role of HA outsiders in our experiments might indicate that, as in the case of vacuolar fusion (29Wang L. Seeley E.S. Wickner W. Merz A.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), most of the HA-mediated fusion events develop along the circumference rather than in the central region of the CZ. If so, HA outsiders located near the periphery of the CZ can be important for fusion. Alternatively, HA outsiders do not need to be in the immediate proximity to the fusion site and drive the opening and expansion of a fusion pore by generating tension in membrane bilayer. We have suggested recently a specific mechanism by which fusion protein outsiders can produce long range stresses in the membrane (30Kozlov M.M. Chernomordik L.V. Traffic. 2002; 3: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 31Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 175-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, the activated fusion proteins outside the CZ form a dense interconnected protein coat that bends the coat-covered membrane out of its initial shape. The resulting stresses in the membrane bilayer then drive its fusion with the target membrane within the CZ or along the circumference of the CZ. Although the mechanisms by which fusion proteins outside of the CZ influence fusion remain to be understood, our work suggests an interesting convergence between mechanisms of membrane fusion and fission. The involvement of the outsider fusion proteins in the expansion of a fusion pore can be analogous to that of the proteins that mediate membrane budding in diverse membrane fission reactions from the outside of the future fission site, i.e. without being present between the merging membrane monolayers (32Burger K.N.

Because ERK1/2 does not possess a nuclear localization signal (NLS), it remains unknown how ERK1/2 translocates into the nucleus after its phosphorylation. Because proteins larger than ∼40-50 kDa cannot pass through the nuclear pore by simple diffusion (12Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 13Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), it is most likely that other mechanisms are involved in the nuclear translocation of dimeric ERK1/2. Whitehurst et al. (14Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have suggested that ERK1/2 associates directly with components of the nuclear pore. It is also possible that ERK1/2 interacts with other molecules containing an NLS to translocate into the nucleus. Because Gab1 has a putative NLS at its NH2-terminal domain and can associate with phosphorylated ERK1/2 (15Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Gab1 mediates ERK1/2 nuclear translocation. Gab1 is a member of the docking protein family, and has binding motifs such as pleckstrin homology domain at its NH2-terminal region, several proline-rich SH3 domain-binding sequences, as well as tyrosine phosphorylation sites for potential Src homology 2-binding molecules such as Grb2, Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 (SHP-2), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. An important domain in Gab1 is the proline-rich MET-binding domain (MBD), which mediates the interaction of Gab1 with the c-MET receptor (16Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Roshan et al. (15Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have reported that Gab1 can associate directly with phosphorylated ERK2 via the MBD and act as a substrate for ERK1/2. However, the functional consequence of this association remains unknown. In the present study we show that the Gab1-ERK1/2 interaction via the MBD is critical for ERK1/2 nuclear translocation and the subsequent induction of Egr-1 expression and nuclear translocation. Cell Culture—Fetal bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were purchased from Clonetics Corp and maintained in Medium 199 (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid Construction—pcDNA3 HA-Gab1 was a kind gift from Dr. Hirano (17Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida Y. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yamanaka Y. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4109-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Xpress-tagged Gab1 and various deletion mutants of Xpress-Gab1 were created by cloning PCR-amplified DNA fragments corresponding to the different Gab1 regions into the NotI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3.1/His vector. The C-terminal RFP-tagged wild-type (WT) Gab1 (WT-Gab1-RFP) and putative NLS region deletion mutant (ΔNLS-Gab1-RFP) were constructed by inserting an EcoRI-KpnI fragment, generated by PCR, into pDsRed2-N1vector (Clontech). Gab1 deletion mutant of amino acids 1-179 tagged with RFP (Gab1-RFP) was constructed using the unique internal BamHI site in Gab1. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To reduce Gab1 expression, we designed two antisense S-oligos from hamster Gab1, AAG TTG AAG CGT TAT GCA TG (nucleic acids 58-77) and GAC CAC GCC AAG AAA CCT AT (nucleic acids 151-170). Polyamine transfection reagent (PANVERA, TransIT-LT1) was used for transfection of antisense oligos as described previously (18Osawa M. Masuda M. Kusano K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In brief, subconfluent CHOs in 35-mm dishes were washed twice with serum-free OPTI medium (Invitrogen). 12 μl of TransIT-LT1 (Pan-Vera) was mixed with 100 μl of serum-free OPTI medium. After 20 min, 6 μm antisense oligos (antisense S-oligos from Hamster Gab1, 5′-GAC CAC GCC AAG AAA CCT AT-3′ (nucleic acids 151-170)) were added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. CHOs in 1 ml of serum-free OPTI medium were treated with this mixture (final oligo concentration = 800 nm), and cells were cultured for 72 h. Under these (high transfection efficiency) conditions, 80% of cells were transfected (see Fig. 2h) and the Gab1 expression of the culture was decreased by 70% (see Fig. 2j). CHOs were washed and placed in 1 ml of serum-free OPTI medium as above. They were then treated with antisense S-oligos (final concentration = 600 nm) in the OPTI-TransIT-LTI mixture for 48 h. Under these low transfection efficiency conditions, Gab1 down-regulation occurred in 30-40% of CHOs.Fig. 2Serum-induced nuclear translocation of Gab1, ERK1, and Egr-1 in BAEC and CHO cells. a-c, BAECs were subjected to serum starvation for 16 h and were stimulated by 10% serum. The time courses for nuclear translocation and accumulation of Gab1 (a), ERK1 (b), and Egr-1 (c) were detected by immunofluorescence. d-f, CHO cells were subjected to serum starvation for 2 days and were stimulated by 10% serum. The time courses for nuclear translocation and accumulation of Gab1 (d), ERK1 (e), and Egr-1 (f) were detected by immunofluorescence. g, antisense Gab1 oligo, but not random S-oligo, reduced Gab1 expression in CHO cells. h, reduction of Gab1 expression by antisense S-oligo Gab1 inhibited ERK1 nuclear translocation in CHO cells. Signals from double-immunofluorescence staining using anti-Gab1 and anti-ERK1 were observed in the same cells. The intensity of immunofluorescence of ERK1 was compared in cytoplasm with that in nucleus, and nuclear accumulations of ERK1 were determined when the intensity in the nucleus was higher than that in cytoplasm. i and j, serum increased Gab1 and ERK1 expression in Triton-insoluble fraction in BAEC (i) and CHO cells (j), and reduction of Gab1 expression decreased serum-induced ERK1 expression in Triton-insoluble fraction. Expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, caveolin, and β-actin in both fractions were determined by Western blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer as described previously (19Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma) or agarose-conjugated anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (Covance) were used for immunoprecipitation. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (19Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendeler J. Huang Q. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11706-11712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In brief, the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the anti-Gab1 (Upstate Biotechnology), ERK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), proliferating cell nuclear antigen, caveolin (BD Biosciences), β-actin (Abcam), or FLAG (Sigma) antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). For subcellular fractionation, cells were lysed in a buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science): 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6). 10-60 μg of protein were loaded per well and separated by SDS-10% PAGE. The above extraction protocol was used in the detergent-soluble fraction from cells. To extract Gab1 and ERK1 from the detergent-insoluble fraction, pellets containing detergent-insoluble Gab1 and ERK1 were triturated (×10) through a 22-gauge needle in a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1 mm EDTA, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4). This was sonicated for 5 min, centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min, and fractions of this supernatant were separated by SDS-10% PAGE, and Western blotting was performed with anti-Gab1 and ERK1 antibody as described above. Because Gab1 can also translocate to the membrane, as we described previously (18Osawa M. Masuda M. Kusano K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), we tried to decrease the contamination of membrane compartment in nuclei-representative fraction as much as possible. Therefore, although we found contamination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in the Triton-soluble fraction, we used this fractionation method to separate membrane compartment. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 3.7% formal-dehyde for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.05% Triton X-100. They were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (Vector) and treated with primary antibodies, polyclonal anti-ERK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or monoclonal anti-ERK1 (BD Biosciences), phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology), Gab1 (Upstate Biotechnology), Gab1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Egr-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Xpress (Invitrogen), and ERK5 antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Jiing-Dwan Lee; Ref. 20Abe J.

Secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa dye against rabbit IgG or mouse IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes. Images were obtained using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus) equipped with a charge-coupled device camera and an Acroplan Water 40, 60XW lens. Gab1 Translocates to the Nucleus with ERK1/2 and Egr-1 in BAEC—Because ERK1/2 and Egr-1 activation are critical for the expression of growth factors and inflammatory mediators (2Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 7Khachigian L.M. Collins T. Circ.

At 24 h after scratch wound assay, we found that both ERK1 and Egr-1 had translocated to cell nuclei at the wound edge (Fig. 1a). We then surveyed the wound margin area with antibodies to several different signaling molecules, including SHP-2, Gab1, Src, and PECAM-1, which are known to regulate ERK1/2-Egr-1 activation (18Osawa M. Masuda M. Kusano K. Fujiwara K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22Huang Q. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Che W. Ohta S. Osawa M. Yoshizumi M. Glassman M. Yan C.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26803-26809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Among these molecules, we found that Gab1, ERK1, and Egr-1 accumulated in a similar manner in the nucleus of BAEC at the wound edge area (Fig 1, a and b). No signal was detected when only secondary antibody was used (data not shown). Because Roshan et al. (15Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have reported that Gab1 associates with activated ERK1/2, we hypothesized that Gab1 nuclear translocation may be needed for ERK1/2 and Egr-1 nuclear accumulation in migrating cells. Nuclear Translocation of Gab1, ERK1/2, and Egr-1—Because EC migration to reendothelialize injured vessels occurs in the presence of platelet aggregation and degranulation, we studied the effect of serum on Gab1 nuclear translocation. As shown in Fig. 2a, Gab1 translocates to the nucleus after 1 h of 10% serum stimulation and maintains its nuclear localization for 24 h. ERK1 and Egr-1 show similar nuclear accumulations after serum stimulation (Fig. 2, b and c). Both ERK1 and Egr-1 appear in the nucleus after 30 min, peak at 1 h, and are sustained after 24 h of serum stimulation. These data suggest that nuclear translocation of Gab1, ERK1, and Egr-1 induced by serum is similar at the wound edge area in migrating endothelial cells. To determine whether Gab1 nuclear translocation in proliferating cells is a universal characteristic, we determined the nuclear translocation and accumulation of Gab1, ERK1, and Egr-1 in CHO cells. Gab1 localized in cytoplasm in serum-deprived CHO cells. After 10% serum stimulation, Gab1 translocated to the membrane as described previously (24Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We also found significant Gab1 nuclear accumulation after 10 min of serum stimulation, which was sustained for more than 4 h after stimulation (Fig. 2d and data not shown). To confirm the specificity of this Gab1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), which was produced with a synthetic C-terminal peptide corresponding to residues 664-694 of human Gab1, we compared endogenous Gab1 staining and translocation with another Gab1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which was produced from a different epitope corresponding to amino acids 119-316 of human Gab1. We found similar staining patterns of Gab1 with these two different antibodies (data not shown). To further confirm the specificity of these Gab1 antibodies for endogenous Gab1, we used antisense Gab1 oligos and determined whether these antisense Gab1 oligos, which were specifically designed to inhibit Gab1 expression, could reduce immunostaining detected by the Gab1 antibodies used in this study (Fig. 2g). We found that antisense Gab1 oligos could significantly decrease Gab1 immunostaining, compared with random oligo-transfected cells as shown in Fig. 2g. These data support the specificity of anti-Gab1 antibodies, which we used in this study, to detect endogenous Gab1 expression and localization. As shown in Fig. 2i, we found that Gab1 and ERK1 expression were increased in Triton-insoluble fractions by serum stimulation, which also supports Gab1 and ERK1 nuclear translocation into the nucleus. Finally, we found that ERK1 and Egr-1 nuclear translocation and accumulation in CHO cells was accompanied with Gab1 in response to 10% serum as shown in Fig. 2, e and f. These data suggest that Gab1, ERK1, and Egr-1 nuclear translocation and accumulation is a universal phenomenon in migrating and proliferating cells and is not specific to EC. ERK1 and Egr-1 nuclear translocation and accumulation were faster in CHO cells than in BAEC (10 versus 30 min). The faster nuclear translocation of Gab1 in CHO cells may be responsible for faster nuclear translocation and accumulation of ERK1 and Egr-1 (see Fig. 6). NLS and Cytoplasmic Retention Signals (CRS) in Gab1—Because a putative NLS (amino acids 15-23) was observed in the Gab1 sequence, we evaluated its function by generating an NLS deletion mutant of Gab1 (ΔNLS-Gab1) (Fig. 3a) and transfected it into CHO cells. Wild-type Gab1 tagged with RFP (WT-Gab1-RFP) localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane (Fig. 3b). In contrast, in cells transfected with ΔNLS-Gab1-RFP, we could not detect any fluorescent signal in the nucleus, and the signal was mainly localized in cytoplasm (Fig. 3c). These results suggest that the NLS domain of Gab1 is functional. To identify the CRS in Gab1, we generated several deletion mutants of Gab1 containing NLS (Fig. 3a). Gab1 (amino acids 1-99) localized only in the nucleus (Fig. 3d), whereas Gab1 (amino acids 1-422) could be detected in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 3e), suggesting that the region of amino acids 99-442 of Gab1 contains a CRS. Because the Gab1 fragment (amino acids 1-99) is smaller than 20 kDa, it is possible that Gab1 could translocate to the nucleus independently of the NLS (12Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 13Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Therefore, we generated two different RFP-tagged Gab1-deletion mutants containing the N-terminal region of Gab1 with or without NLS, Gab1-RFP, and ΔNLS-Gab1-RFP, respectively (Fig. 3a). ΔNLS-Gab1-RFP signals were not found in the nucleus (Fig. 3g). In contrast, Gab1-RFP accumulated in the nucleus in more than 20% of the transfected cells (Fig. 3f). Importantly, Gab1-RFP (amino acids 1-179) is longer than ΔNLS-Gab1-RFP (amino acids 23-179) (Fig. 3a). Of note, because the RFP-tag contains 226 amino acids, the total length of Gab1-RFP is similar to Gab1-Xpress (amino acids 1-422). Therefore, the different localization of Gab1-Xpress and Gab1-RFP is not due to the size of these molecules. These data suggest that Gab1 has functional NLS and CRS domains, which determine Gab1 cellular localization independently of the size of the deletion mutants. As shown in Fig. 3b, when WT-Gab1-RFP transfected cells were cultured at low confluence (<30%), we could detect WT-Gab1-RFP signals in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Because endogenous Gab1 accumulated in the nucleus in migrating and serum-stimulated cells, the localization of exogenously overexpressed WT-Gab1-RFP was slightly different from endogenous Gab1. However, when the cells became confluent, WT-Gab1-RFP translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, b versus h and i). This finding is consistent with endogenous Gab1 localization in confluent areas, as we observed at wound edge (Fig. 1). This cell contact-mediated Gab1 translocation from nucleus to cytosol also suggests a functional role of the CRS domain of Gab1. Gab1 Associates and Regulates ERK1/2 Localization—To determine whether Gab1 can regulate ERK nuclear translocation, we transfected ΔNLS-Gab1 in CHO cells and determined serum-mediated endogenous ERK1/2 activation and nuclear translocation. To detect the nuclear translocation, the intensities of immunofluorescence of Gab1, ERK1, and Egr-1 were compared in cytoplasm to nucleus by image analysis, and the nuclear accumulation of Gab1, ERK1, and Egr-1 was determined. As shown in Fig. 4a, WT-Gab1-RFP localized in both nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas ΔNLS-Gab1-RFP mainly localized in the cytoplasm as described in Fig. 3. When cells were transfected with WT-Gab1-RFP, ERK1 translocated to the nucleus after 10% serum stimulation (Fig. 4a), and this nuclear translocation was also detected by antiphospho-ERK1/2 antibody (Fig. 4c), which was similar to the findings in non-transfected cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, serum-induced nuclear translocation of ERK1 and phospho-ERK1/2 was significantly inhibited by the expression of ΔNLS-Gab1 (Fig. 4, b and d). We also counted the number of the cells that were transfected by Gab1 wild-type or mutants and then determined what percentage of the total transfected cells revealed nuclear translocation (Fig. 4, e and f). We found that expression of ΔNLS-Gab1 significantly decreased the ratio of ERK1 or phosphorylated ERK1/2 nuclear-accumulated cells per ΔNLS-Gab1-RFP-transfected cells, compared with those in WT-Gab1-RFP-transfected cells. These results suggest a critical role for Gab1 nuclear translocation in regulating ERK1/2 nuclear translocation, but not for ERK1/2 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4g, we also found that serum-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not inhibited by ΔNLS-Gab1. In addition, we did not find any significant difference in serum-induced ERK5 nuclear translocation between WT-Gab1-transfected (Fig. 4h) and ΔNLS-Gab1-transfected (Fig. 4i) cells. These data suggest that the regulatory effect of Gab1 is specific for ERK1/2 nuclear translocation, but not for ERK1/2 kinase activation and ERK5 nuclear translocation. Gab1-MBD Disrupts Gab1/ERK Association and Inhibits ERK1/2 and Egr-1 Nuclear Accumulation—Because Roshan et al. (15Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) have reported that Gab1 associates with ERK1/2 via the Gab1 MBD domain, we next determined whether the expression of the Gab1-MBD domain fragment can disrupt Gab1 and ERK1 association and the subsequent ERK1 and Egr-1 nuclear accumulation. CHO cells were co-transfected with Xpress-tagged Gab1-MBD or vector alone with HA-tagged ERK2, co-immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and immunoblotted with anti-Gab1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, a and c, overexpression of the Gab1-MBD domain fragment (Fig. 5a), but not the Gab1-ΔMBD fragment (Fig. 5c) containing the N-terminal domain of Gab1 (except the MBD domain) (Fig. 3a), inhibited serum-induced Gab1 and HA-ERK2 association (Fig. 5a). The Gab1-MBD fragment did not inhibit ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 5a), suggesting a specific effect of the Gab1-MBD fragment upon Gab1-ERK1/2 interaction. To examine the role of Gab1-ERK1/2 interaction for serum-induced ERK1 and Egr-1 nuclear translocation, we expressed the Gab1-MBD-Xpress fragment (Fig. 5, b and e) or Gab1-ΔMBD-Xpress fragment (Fig. 5, d and f), and determined ERK1 (Fig. 5, b, d, and g) and Egr-1 (Fig. 5, e, f, and h) nuclear accumulation after serum stimulation. ERK1 (Fig. 5, b and g) and Egr-1 (Fig. 5, e and h) nuclear accumulation were significantly inhibited in Gab1-MBD fragment-transfected cells. In contrast, the nuclear accumulation of ERK1 (Fig. 5, d and g) and Egr-1 (Fig. 5, f and h) was not affected by Gab1-ΔMBD domain expression. Furthermore, we found that reduction of Gab1 expression by antisense Gab1 oligos significantly inhibited serum-induced ERK1 nuclear accumulation compared with random oligos in a high transfection efficiency conditions (60-80%) (Fig. 2h). We also observed a similar inhibition of ERK1 nuclear accumulation by antisense Gab1 under low transfection efficiency conditions (30-40%, and data not shown), suggesting that the inhibition of ERK1 nuclear accumulation by antisense Gab1 is specific to down-regulation of Gab1 expression, and this is not due to the condition of a high dose of antisense transfection. To determine the role of Gab1 on ERK1 translocation by cell fractionation using Western blot analysis, we do need to knock down Gab1 expression by at least 60-70%. Therefore, we used the high transfection efficiency conditions, and we found that 80% of cells were transfected (Fig. 2g) and the Gab1 expression of the culture was decreased by 70% (Fig. 2j). In this case, the serum-induced ERK1 expression in the Triton-insoluble fraction was significantly decreased by the reduction of Gab1 (as shown in Fig. 2j). Taken together, these results suggest that Gab1 and ERK1/2 association are critical for ERK1 and Egr-1 nuclear translocation and accumulation. In the present study, we found that Gab1 regulates the active import of phosphorylated ERK1/2 into the nucleus. To our knowledge, this is the first report to document the nuclear translocation of Gab1. We determined that Gab1 has functional NLS and CRS domains. Gab1 associates with phosphorylated ERK1/2 by means of the Gab1 MBD. Importantly, disruption of Gab1 and phosphorylated ERK1/2 interaction by transfection of a Gab1-MBD construct prevented endogenous ERK1 and Egr-1 nuclear translocation and accumulation. These data suggest the importance of Gab1-ERK1/2 interaction for ERK1/2 and Egr-1 nuclear accumulation in migrating and proliferating cells (Fig. 6). It remains unclear how Gab1 switches the activity of NLS and CRS. Because Gab1 has many serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation sites and associates with many regulators of phosphorylation (e.g. SHP-2 and PI-3K), phosphorylation may change Gab1 conformation and switch the activity of NLS and CRS. Because proteins smaller than 40-50 kDa readily diffuse into the nucleus (12Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 13Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar), it has been presumed that monomeric ERKs enter the nucleus by diffusion. However, Khokhlatchev et al. (11Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) reported that dimerization of ERKs is essential for ligand-dependent nuclear accumulation, and nuclear accumulation of ERK2 depends upon its phosphorylation state rather than on its activity. Although active dimeric ERK1/2 is too large for unrestricted diffusion into the nucleus, upon introduction of active dimeric ERK1/2 into the cytoplasm, there is rapid accumulation in the nucleus. These data strongly suggest that ERK1/2 dimers are actively imported (10Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 7-9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 11Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), despite the fact that ERK1/2 does not contain a nuclear localization signal. Therefore, it has been proposed that dimerization of ERK1/2 may expose a binding site for a protein containing a NLS (11Khokhlatchev A.V. Canagarajah B. Wilsbacher J. Robinson M. Atkinson M. Goldsmith E. Cobb M.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 605-615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and be imported by a piggy-back mechanism because of the association with NLS-containing protein(s) (13Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Although Whitehurst et al. (14Whitehurst A.W. Wilsbacher J.L. You Y. Luby-Phelps K. Moore M.S. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have shown that ERK2 binds directly to nucleoporins, which are the components of the nuclear pore and mediate the entry and exit of transport factors by an energy- and carrier-independent mechanism, the presence of an active transport system is also suggested (11Khokhlatchev A.V.

Therefore, we propose that Gab1 is one of the active proteins that transports ERK1/2 into the nucleus. Egr-1 expression is increased in EC at the wound edge area (2Khachigian L.M. Lindner V.

Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2280-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and Egr-1 is highly expressed in EC overlaying atherosclerotic plaques (21McCaffrey T.A. Fu C. Du B. Eksinar S.

Invest. 2000; 105: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), which suggests a role for Egr-1 in re-endothelialization. Egr-1 is known as an immediate early gene, which is induced by many extracellular stimuli, including phorbol esters, growth factors, cytokines, and shear stress (2Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Science. 1996; 271: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The Egr-1 promoter contains five serum-response elements, and transcriptional activation by extracellular signals is often mediated by serum-response elements or Ets elements (4Thiel G. Cibelli G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 25Sakamoto K.M. Bardeleben C. Yates K.E. Raines M.A. Golde D.W. Gasson J.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 867-871PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between serum response factor and ternary complex factors, such as Ets-like transcription factor-1 and sphingolipid activator protein-1, at serum-response elements regulates Egr-1 expression. Because both Ets-like transcription factor-1 and sphingolipid activator protein-1 are phosphorylated and activated by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and ERK1/2 kinase activation in nucleus, ERK1/2 activation and nuclear translocation are clearly two of the critical mediators for Egr-1 transcriptional activity and its expression (2Khachigian L.M.

Egr-1 plays a positive regulatory role in the inducible expression of many endothelial genes which influence chemotactic, proliferative, and thrombogenic events associated with atherogenesis (7Khachigian L.M.

Egr-1 also regulates the expression of cytokine and adhesion molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (31Kramer B. Meichle A. Hensel G. Charnay P. Kronke M.

These findings suggest that Egr-1 is an important nuclear mediator in signal transduction to regulate multiple pathophysiologically relevant genes in response to vascular injury. In the present study, we found that Gab1 nuclear translocation is critical for serum-induced ERK1/2 and Egr-1 nuclear translocation and accumulation, suggesting a potential role of Gab1 in endothelial damage and subsequent atherogenesis. Recent studies have shown that the duration of ERK1/2 signaling is critical for immediate early gene-mediated signaling and subsequent cell-cycle progression. When ERK1/2 activation is transient and not sustained, immediate early gene product c-Fos is unstable and rapidly degraded. In contrast, sustained ERK1/2 activation phosphorylates and stabilizes c-Fos, and promotes c-Fos-mediated cellular transformation (34Murphy L.O. Smith S. Chen R.H. Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). We found that Gab1 and ERK1 were still localized to the nucleus up to 4 h after serum stimulation (data not shown). Gab1 and ERK1/2 associate and persistently localize in the nucleus, suggesting that Gab1 may also be important for anchoring ERK1/2 in the nucleus (Fig. 6). Further studies are required to clarify the anchoring mechanism of ERK1/2 in the nucleus. We found that overexpression of Gab1 seems to “flatten” the cells (Figs. 3 and 4). Because Gab1 is also associated with membrane-localized molecules, including tyrosine kinase receptor and SHP-2, and several focal adhesion molecules, it is reasonable to think that Gab1 overexpression may affect the focal adhesion molecules and change structure proteins and cell shapes. This field is a very interesting one to investigate, and further investigation is necessary to clarify this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2063896801,"Certain uterine prostaglandins (PGs) are elevated at implantation sites and are needed to trigger the events of blastocyst implantation that include blastocyst-uterine attachment and stromal decidualization with vascular permeability changes. Several decades of investigations showed that treatment with PG synthesis inhibitors, prior to or during the time of implantation, resulted in either complete inhibition or a delay in implantation or reduction in the number of implantation sites with diminished decidual tissue. Consistent with these findings, we observed that whereas a selective PG endoperoxide synthase (Ptgs) 1 inhibitor SC-560 failed to inhibit implantation, a selective Ptgs2 inhibitor SC-236 showed significantly reduced number and size of implantation sites in progesterone-treated ovariectomized pregnant hamsters. It is known that Ptgs2 expression and Ptgs2-derived prostacyclin (PGI2) synthesis at implantation sites are needed for implantation in the mouse (a rodent that needs ovarian estrogen for implantation). However, it is unknown which Ptgs and PG synthases produce which PGs at implantation sites of the hamster (a rodent that does not need ovarian estrogen for implantation). Here we demonstrate that as blastocyst implantation proceeds, a reduction in Ptgs1 expression from uterine luminal epithelial cells and a gradual induction in Ptgs2 expression exclusively in luminal epithelial and adjacent decidual cells occurred at implantation sites of hamsters. Results also reveal that PGE2, but not PGI2, is the major PG at implantation sites where Ptgs2 and microsomal type PGE synthases but not PGI synthases are co-expressed. This elevated uterine PGE2 at implantation sites may serve to initiate or amplify physiological signals required for specific aspects of the implantation process in hamsters.

Blastocyst implantation is a required event of pregnancy, and its failure is a leading cause of infertility in females. Since their discovery, prostaglandins (PGs) 1The abbreviations used are: PGs, prostaglandins; Ptgs1, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1; Ptgs2, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2; COX, cyclooxygenase; Ptges, PGE synthase; mPtges, microsomal-type Ptges; Ptgis, PGI synthase; P4, progesterone; E2, estradiol-17β; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; PDZ, primary decidual zone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: PGs, prostaglandins; Ptgs1, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1; Ptgs2, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2; COX, cyclooxygenase; Ptges, PGE synthase; mPtges, microsomal-type Ptges; Ptgis, PGI synthase; P4, progesterone; E2, estradiol-17β; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; PDZ, primary decidual zone; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. have been implicated as critical regulators of important reproductive events including implantation-associated changes during early pregnancy. This was demonstrated by treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prior to or during the time of implantation that resulted in either complete or a partial delay in implantation, depending on the species. NSAIDs inhibit implantation in mice (1Lau I.F. Saksena S.K. Chang M.C. Prostaglandins. 1973; 4: 795-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 2Saksena S.K. Lau I.F. Chang M.C.

Prostaglandins. 1978; 15: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However in rabbits, indomethacin did reduce the following: 1) the intensity of the uterine blue dye reaction at the implantation site, 2) the size of the decidual swellings, and 3) the number of implantation sites. When indomethacin is given to progesterone (P4)-treated ovariectomized pregnant hamsters, it caused a delay in implantation (6Terranova P.F. Dey S.K. Prostaglandins. 1982; 24: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). These adverse effects of NSAIDs are attributed to their actions on either the uterus, the embryo, or both (5Hoffman L.H. DiPietro D.L. McKenna T.J. Prostaglandins. 1978; 15: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Terranova P.F. Dey S.K.

NSAIDs target PG synthesis by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) activity of the PG G/H synthase (9Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 167-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PG G/H synthase, now known as PG-endoperoxide synthase (Ptgs) or COX because of its COX activity, exits in two isoforms Ptgs1 (COX1) and Ptgs2 (COX2). These two enzymes convert arachidonic acid into PGH2, a common precursor of all PGs (9Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 167-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ptgs1 is considered a constitutive enzyme. Ptgs2 is an inducible enzyme and is mainly elevated at the sites of inflammation after a plethora of insults. More recently, however, it has been demonstrated that both Ptgs isoforms are inducible in certain tissues. Consistent with this idea, it has been demonstrated in the mouse uterus that although Ptgs1 is inducible by treatment with estrogen and P4 together, Ptgs2 is only inducible by implanting blastocysts at the site of implantation in mice (10Chakraborty I. Das S.K. Wang J. Dey S.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Creation of Ptgs-mutated mice showed distinct functions of Ptgs1 and Ptgs2 in reproductive processes. Mice devoid of Ptgs1 exhibit parturition defects (11Langenbach R. Morham S.G. Loftin C.D.

Ptgs2-depleted mice showed implantation and decidualization defects during early pregnancy (12Dinchuk J.E. Car B.D. Focht R.J. Johnston J.J. Jaffee B.D. Covington M.B. Contel N.R. Eng V.M.

Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of Ptgs2-directed PG synthesis in the process of implantation. Expression of Ptgs1 is observed in the uterine epithelium prior to implantation in mice. It is then down-regulated at the implantation site. However, expression of Ptgs2 mRNA and protein is observed exclusively in the uterine epithelial and sub-epithelial stromal cells at the implantation site (10Chakraborty I. Das S.K. Wang J. Dey S.K. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 16: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 13Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K.

This implantation-related expression of Ptgs2 is consistent with the defects in implantation and decidualization observed in Ptgs2 mutant mice (13Lim H. Paria B.C. Das S.K. Dinchuk J.E. Langenbach R. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Cell. 1997; 91: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Studies before the creation of Ptgs-mutated mice suggested various functions of uterine PGs during early pregnancy. Although PGF2α is responsible for luteolysis, PGE2 exerts actions opposite to PGF2α to favor establishment of pregnancy with luteoprotective (either luteotrophic or anti-luteolytic) actions (14Behrman H.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1979; 4: 685-695Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PGE2 may also have immunomodulatory roles at the implantation site (15Lala P.K. Am. J. Reprod. Immunol. 1989; 20: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been demonstrated in the mouse that uterine PGE2 and PGI2 are important for ovulation and initiation of implantation, respectively (16Matsumoto H. Ma W. Smalley W. Trzaskos J. Breyer R.M. Dey S.K. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 557-565Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W.G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K.

Reprod. 1979; 20: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showed that in the rat PGE2 but not PGI2 is a key mediator of increased vascular permeability at the implantation site. Considering the fact that the blastocyst either accumulates (19Jones M.A. Harper M.J.K. Endocrinology. 1984; 115: 817-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or synthesizes PGs (20Dey S.K.

Reprod. 1983; 28: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it has been also shown that PGs affect the glucose metabolism of preimplantation embryos (22Khurana N.K. Wales R.G. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1987; 79: 275-280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hatching of the blastocysts (7Biggers J.D. Leonov B.V. Baskar J.F. Fried J. Biol. Reprod. 1978; 19: 519-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The earliest contact between the implantation-competent blastocyst and the receptive uterus in any mammal designates the onset of blastocyst implantation. In mice and rats, maternal estrogen is essential to initiate the process of blastocyst implantation in a P4-primed uterus (23Psychoyos A. Greep R.O. Astwood E.G. Geiger S.R. Handbook of Physiology.

In contrast, maternal estrogen is not required to initiate the process of implantation in the P4-primed uterus in hamsters, rabbits, pigs, guinea pigs, monkeys, and perhaps in humans (26deZiegler D.

Although the importance of PGs during early pregnancy has been recognized in several species that showed P4-dependent implantation, the process of PG synthesis in the uterus of these species has not been studied in detail. As part of our continuing effort to understand the contribution of Ptgs-derived PGs to the process of implantation in various species, we have studied the expression, regulation, and function of Ptgs and Ptgs products during early pregnancy in hamsters that showed P4-dependent implantation. Our results reveal that Ptgs2-derived PGE2 is involved in the successful establishment of implantation in hamsters. Animals—Adult virgin male and female golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus)8–12 weeks-old were purchased from either Sasco, Omaha, NE, or Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA. They were maintained in a 14-h light, 10-h dark cycle in the Animal Facility Laboratory of the Kansas Medical Center (Kansas City, KS) and Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN) with an unlimited access to water and food according to the institutional guidelines on the care and use of laboratory animals. Preparation of Pregnant Hamster and Uterine Tissue Collection— Only hamsters with three consecutive 4-day estrous cycles were used in this study. One female was housed with two fertile males overnight on the evening of proestrus. Finding of sperm in the vaginal smear the next morning (estrus) indicated the 1st day (day 1) of pregnancy. Hamsters on days 1–3 of pregnancy were killed at 0900 h, and whole uteri were collected after confirmation of pregnancy by flushing and recovering embryos from oviducts and/or uteri (37Wang X. Wang H. Matsumoto H. Roy S.K. Das S.K. Paria B.C. Development. 2002; 129: 4125-4134PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas whole uteri were collected on the morning of day 4 (0900 h), implantation and interimplantation sites were collected on the afternoon (1600 h) of day 4 and the morning (0900 h) of days 5 and 6 after an intravenous injection of Chicago Blue B dye solution (Sigma; 0.25 ml of 1% dye in saline). Implantation sites on these days were visualized by intermittent blue bands along the horns. On days 7–8, implantation sites were distinct and were identified visually without blue dye injection (37Wang X. Wang H. Matsumoto H. Roy S.K. Das S.K. Paria B.C. Development. 2002; 129: 4125-4134PubMed Google Scholar). Uterine tissues were immediately frozen in cold Super Friendly Freeze'it (Curtin Matheson Scientific, Houston, TX) and stored at -70 °C until extraction of RNA, in situ hybridization, or immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence. Implantation occurs without delay in hamsters ovariectomized or hypophysectomized on day 2 of pregnancy and given P4 daily (29Harper M.J.K. Dowd D. Elliot A.S.W. Biol. Reprod. 1969; 1: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Orsini M.W. Meyer R.K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962; 110: 713-715Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 35Prasad M.R.N. Orsini M.W. Meyer R.K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1960; 104: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This suggests that implantation in hamsters is P4-dependent. Thus, it is possible that implantation occurred with correct expression of implantation-specific genes because of the regulation of these genes by either P4 or blastocysts. To address this issue, a group of pregnant hamsters was ovariectomized on day 2 (0900 h) and given a subcutaneous injection of P4 (Sigma; 1 mg in 0.1 ml of sesame seed oil/hamster) on either days 2 and 3 or days 2–4. Control hamsters underwent sham operation and were injected with 0.1 ml of vehicle, sesame seed oil (Sigma). Whole uteri were collected on the morning of day 4 (0900 h). Implantation sites, detected by blue dye injection, were collected on the morning of day 5 (0900 h) for in situ hybridization. Analysis of Blastocyst Implantation after Treatment of Ptgs Inhibitors in Ovariectomized P4-treated Pregnant Hamsters—The potential of isoform-selective Ptgs inhibitors to inhibit or delay the initiation of implantation was determined in ovariectomized P4-treated pregnant hamsters. Pregnant hamsters were ovariectomized on day 2 (0900 h) and maintained on daily P4 (1 mg/hamster) injections. One group of hamsters was used as control and received vehicle (0.2 ml of 0.5% (w/v) methylcellulose (Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) polysorbate 80 (Sigma)) through oral gavage. A second group of animals received SC-560 (20 mg/kg oral gavage) twice per day (0900 and 1700 h) from days 2 to 4. SC-560 (5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) is a selective inhibitor of Ptgs1. The remaining hamsters received SC-236 (20 mg/kg oral gavage) once per day (0900 h) on days 2–4. SC-236 (4-[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]benzenesulfonamide; Calbiochem) is a selective inhibitor of Ptgs2 and has a longer half-life in vivo, which allowed for dosing once/day (38Penning T.D.

Hamsters were killed on the morning of day 5 (0900 h) 15 min after blue dye injection. The uteri were examined for evidence of local accumulation of the blue dye at the blastocyst implantation sites. The number of blue implantation sites and the intensity of their blue color were visually recorded. Wet weight of the individual implantation site was also recorded. Significant differences in number of implantation sites and their wet weights between vehicle and Ptgs inhibitors were determined by Student's t test. Measurement of PG Levels at Implantation Site—To determine and compare the PG levels between implantation and interimplantation sites, normal pregnant hamsters were killed on day 5 (0900 h) after blue dye injection. Blue bands (implantation sites) and areas between two blue bands (interimplantation sites) were carefully separated, weighed, and snap-frozen for PG assay. The PG content (PGE2, PGF2α, PGD2, thromboxane B2 (a stable metabolite of thromboxane A2), and 6-keto-PGF1α, a stable metabolite of PGI2) of implant and interimplantation sites was then quantified by utilizing gas chromatography/negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometric assays as described previously (39DuBois R.N. Awad J. Morrow J. Roberts II, L.J. Bishop P.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 493-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Differences in PG levels between implantation and interimplantation sites were compared by Student's t test. Hormonal Effects on Uterine Ptgs2 mRNA Expression—To determine the effect of steroid hormones on uterine Ptgs expression, hamsters were ovariectomized without regard to their stage of estrous cycle and rested for 12 days. These hamsters were treated with a subcutaneous injection of either P4 (500 μg/hamster) or estradiol-17β (E2, Sigma; 1.0 μg/hamster) or E2 plus P4 or the vehicle sesame seed oil. All steroids were dissolved in sesame oil. Hamsters were killed at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after injection of hormones, and uteri were collected for in situ hybridization. The dosages of P4 and E2 were chosen depending on the previously reported sensitivity of the hamster uterus to these hormones (33Orsini M.W. Meyer R.K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962; 110: 713-715Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 37Wang X. Wang H. Matsumoto H. Roy S.K. Das S.K. Paria B.C. Development. 2002; 129: 4125-4134PubMed Google Scholar). The hamster uterus is very sensitive to P4, and treatment of 500 μg of P4 daily is reported to be sufficient to maintain pregnancy in ovariectomized pregnant hamsters (33Orsini M.W. Meyer R.K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1962; 110: 713-715Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In contrast, sensitivity of the hamster uterus to E2 is poor (40Giannina T. Butler M. Popick F. Steinetz B.G. Contraception. 1971; 3: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and single injection of 1 μg of E2 is required to induce genes in the ovariectomized hamster uterus (37Wang X. Wang H. Matsumoto H. Roy S.K. Das S.K. Paria B.C. Development. 2002; 129: 4125-4134PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of the Hamster Ptgs1, Ptgs2, mPtges, and Ptgis Partial cDNAs—Reverse transcription-PCR was employed to generate the hamster-specific Ptgs1, Ptgs2, mPtges, and Ptgis partial cDNA clones. The mouse complete coding sequences for all four genes were compared for homology with the human and the rat coding sequences using the ClustalW Multiple Sequence Alignment program. The mouse coding region that showed maximum sequence homology between the three species was used to design sense and antisense PCR primers for Ptgs1, Ptgs2, mPtges, and Ptgis. The primers were Ptgs1 (GenBank™ accession number NM008969; spanning nucleotides 1427–1797; size, 371; 5′-CCT TCA ATG AAT ACC GAA AGA GG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTA ATC TGG CAC ACG GAA GG-3′ (antisense)), Ptgs2 (GenBank™ accession number NM011198; spanning nucleotides 435–821; size, 387; 5′-CAA CCT CTC CTA CTA CAC C-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTA CCT GAG TGT CTT TGA CTG-3′ (antisense)), mPtges (GenBank™ accession number AB041997; spanning nucleotides 105–514; size, 410; 5′-AGC ACA CTG CTG GTC ATC AAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCT GCT GGT CAC AGA TGG TG-3′ (antisense)), and Ptgis (GenBank™ accession number NM008968; spanning nucleotides 309–701; size, 393; 5′-CCT CAT GGA GAG GAT TTT TGA T-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACA CTG CAT GCA TGG TCT TTA T-3′ (antisense)). Total RNAs (1 μg) from day 4 pregnant hamster uterus and kidney were reversed-transcribed with oligo(dT) at 42 °C for 50 min using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out with an initial denaturation of 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 64 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s. This was followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 8 min. Reverse transcription-PCR generated uterine Ptgs1, Ptgs2, and Ptgis, and kidney mPtges products were subcloned into a pCR®-II-TOPO® cloning vector (3.9 kb) using TOPO TA Cloning kit, version K2 (Invitrogen), and nucleotide sequences of the clone were determined on both strands to verify the identity of the clone. Nucleotide sequences of these partial cDNA clones showed more than 85% sequence similarity with that of the GenBank™ nucleotide data base for rats, mice, and humans. The GenBank™ accession numbers for hamster Ptgs1 and Ptgs2 are AF414605 and AF345331, respectively. RNA Probe Preparation—For in situ hybridization, plasmids bearing hamster cDNA were extracted, purified, and linearized to generate antisense and sense riboprobes, which were transcribed using appropriate RNA polymerases (Ptgs1, SP6/NotI for antisense and T7/HindIII for sense; Ptgs2, SP6/XhoI for antisense and T7/HindIII for sense; mPtges, T7/BamHI for antisense and SP6/NotI for sense; Ptgis, SP6/NotI for antisense and T7/HindIII for sense) and labeled with 35S (41Das S.K. Wang X.-N. Paria B.C. Damn D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. Andrews G.K. Dey S.K. Development. 1994; 120: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All labeled sense and antisense cRNA probes used for hybridizations had specific activities of ∼2 × 109 dpm/μl. In Situ Hybridization—The protocol was followed as described by Das et al. (41Das S.K. Wang X.-N. Paria B.C. Damn D. Abraham J.A. Klagsbrun M. Andrews G.K. Dey S.K. Development. 1994; 120: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, uterine cryosections were mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides and fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min on ice. After prehybridization, sections were hybridized to 35S-labeled antisense probes at 45 °C for 4 h in 50% formamide hybridization buffer. Parallel sections were hybridized with 35S-labeled sense probes as negative control. After hybridization and washing, sections were incubated with RNase A (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 20 min. RNase A-resistant hybrids were detected by autoradiography using Kodak NTB-2 liquid emulsion (Eastman Kodak Co.). The slides were poststained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemistry—Rabbit polyclonal antibody to Ptgs2 was a generous gift from Dr. S. K. Dey, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to mPtges was purchased from Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI. Immunocytochemical localization of these proteins was performed as described previously (42Paria B.C. Zhao X. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Yoshinaga K. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 488-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In brief, frozen sections (10 μm) were mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for Ptgs2 for 15 min and in Bouin's solution for mPtges for 30 min. Sections were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), treated with 10% nonimmune goat serum (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 10 min at room temperature, and incubated with respective primary antibodies (antibody dilution, Ptgs2 (0.022 μg/μl) and mPtges (0.02 μg/μl)) overnight at 4 °C. After removal of the primary antibody, the sections were washed with PBS and incubated with biotin-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 10 min at room temperature. PBS-washed sections were treated with periodic acid (Sigma; 0.23% in PBS) for 45 s to block the endogenous peroxidase activity. PBS-washed sections were next incubated with streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were then washed with PBS and incubated with AEC single solution (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) to obtain final color product. Sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Red deposits indicated the sites of immunoreactive proteins. The specificity of the staining was confirmed with primary antibody either preabsorbed with the antigen peptide (1 μm) or replaced with equal amounts of nonimmune rabbit IgG (Sigma). Double Immunostaining—In case of double immunostaining of Ptgs2 and mPtges, a slide having sections from several day 5 implantation sites was fixed in a mixture (1:1) of 4% paraformaldehyde and Bouin's solution. After fixation, the slide was first incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies of mPtges (1:500 dilutions) overnight at 4 °C and visualized with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The same slide was then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal Ptgs2 antibody (1:500 dilutions) at room temperature for 2 h and visualized with a rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Primary antibodies were replaced with nonimmune rabbit IgG in control sections. Fluorescence images were captured in a fluorescence microscope. The staining was also performed in reverse order, and in both cases inappropriate cross-reactions were negligible. Isoform-specific Ptgs Inhibition Alters Embryo Implantation in Ovariectomized P4-treated Pregnant Hamsters—Studies in various species demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of Ptgs by NSAIDs leads to either complete or partial delay in implantation (1Lau I.F.

https://openalex.org/W2033343083,"The cellular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein replication protein A (RPA) becomes phosphorylated periodically during the normal cell cycle and also in response to DNA damage. In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, RPA phosphorylation requires the checkpoint protein Mec1, a protein kinase homologous in structure and function to human ATR. We confirm here that immunocomplexes containing a tagged version of Mec1 catalyze phosphorylation of purified RPA, likely reflecting an RPA kinase activity intrinsic to Mec1. A significant stimulation of this activity is observed upon the addition of covalently closed ssDNA derived from the bacteriophage M13. This stimulation is not observed with mutant RPA deficient for DNA binding, indicating that DNA-bound RPA is a preferred substrate. Stimulation is also observed upon the addition of linear ssDNA homopolymers or hydrolyzed M13 ssDNA. In contrast to circular ssDNA, these DNA cofactors stimulate both wild type and mutant RPA phosphorylation. This finding suggests that linear ssDNA can also stimulate Mec1-mediated RPA phosphorylation by activating Mec1 or an associated protein. Although the Mec1-interacting protein Ddc2 is required for RPA phosphorylation <i>in vivo</i>, it is required for neither basal nor ssDNA-stimulated RPA phosphorylation <i>in vitro</i>. Therefore, activation of Mec1-mediated RPA phosphorylation by either circular or linear ssDNA does not operate through Ddc2. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms that function <i>in vivo</i> to specifically induce RPA phosphorylation upon initiation of DNA replication, repair, or recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2024076463,"Recent studies have shown that metastasis-associated protein-1 short form (MTA1s) - metastatic tumor antigen 1 short form sequesters estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-alpha) in the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening to clone MTA1s-interacting proteins, we identified casein kinase I-gamma 2 (CKI-gamma2, a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic kinase) as an MTA1s-binding protein. We show that MTA1s interacts with CKI-gamma2 both in vitro and in vivo and colocalizes in the cytoplasm. In addition, we found that CKI-gamma2 can phosphorylate MTA1s, but not ER, in an antiestrogen-dependent manner and that estrogen stimulates CKI-gamma2 activity that could be effectively blocked by a specific inhibitor of CKI. CKI-gamma2 could further potentiate the ER corepressive function of MTA1s. Kinase dead CK1-gamma2 could not repress estrogen-induced ER transactivation functions. Results from mutagenesis studies suggest that substitution of the serine residue at 321 to alanine, which is a possible CKI-gamma2 phopshorylation site in MTA1s, results in a significant reduction in the ability of MTA1s to repress ER transactivation. These findings identified MTA1s as a target of CKI-gamma2, and provided new evidence to suggest that CKI-gamma2 phosphorylates and modulates the functions of MTA1s, and that these extranuclear effects of estrogen might have important implications in regulating the functions of MTA1s in human mammary epithelial and cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1974786799,"E6/E7 oncogenes of high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) subtypes are essential for the development of certain types of cancers. However, these oncogenes are insufficient to transform normal cells into an immortalized or malignant state. Mutant Ha-ras cooperates with E6/E7 of HPV subtype 16 in transformation of cells in vitro and may contribute to some HPV-associated cancers in humans. This study investigates whether HPV16 E6/E7 and v-Ha-ras synergize in vivo. FVB/n mice transgenic for v-Ha-ras gene (R+) were crossed with transgenic C57BL/6 mice that harbor E6/E7 of HPV16 (E+). Beginning at about 3 months of age, the bitransgenic E(+)R(+)(C57BL/6 x FVB/n) F1 mice developed mouth, eye and ear tumors. By 6 months, the prevalence of these types of mouth, eye and ear tumors was 100, 71 and 79% respectively in the E(+)R+ mice. Most tumors grew progressively until the mice had to be killed. The median times for the appearance of the first mouth, eye and ear tumor were 3.6, 4.3 and 4.2 months, respectively. For the two singly transgenic groups of mice, the prevalence of mouth, eye and ear tumors was 0, 0 and 6% (E(-)R+) and 0, 0 and 0% (E(+)R-), respectively, and the median time to first tumor was greater than 12 months for singly transgenic mice (E(-)R+, E(+)R-). Thus, a remarkable synergy occurred between the v-Ha-ras and HPV16 E6/E7 oncogenes in the development of primary tumors in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2001641780,"The catalytic domain of xylanases belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10) can be divided into 22 modules (M1 to M22; Sato, Y., Niimura, Y., Yura, K., and Go, M. (1999) Gene (Amst.) 238, 93-101). Inspection of the crystal structure of a GH10 xylanase from Streptomyces olivaceoviridis E-86 (SoXyn10A) revealed that the catalytic domain of GH10 xylanases can be dissected into two parts, an N-terminal larger region and C-terminal smaller region, by the substrate binding cleft, corresponding to the module border between M14 and M15. It has been suggested that the topology of the substrate binding clefts of GH10 xylanases are not conserved (Charnock, S. J., Spurway, T. D., Xie, H., Beylot, M. H., Virden, R., Warren, R. A. J., Hazlewood, G. P., and Gilbert, H. J. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 32187-32199). To facilitate a greater understanding of the structure-function relationship of the substrate binding cleft of GH10 xylanases, a chimeric xylanase between SoXyn10A and Xyn10A from Cellulomonas fimi (CfXyn10A) was constructed, and the topology of the hybrid substrate binding cleft established. At the three-dimensional level, SoXyn10A and CfXyn10A appear to possess 5 subsites, with the amino acid residues comprising subsites -3 to +1 being well conserved, although the +2 subsites are quite different. Biochemical analyses of the chimeric enzyme along with SoXyn10A and CfXyn10A indicated that differences in the structure of subsite +2 influence bond cleavage frequencies and the catalytic efficiency of xylooligosaccharide hydrolysis. The hybrid enzyme constructed in this study displays fascinating biochemistry, with an interesting combination of properties from the parent enzymes, resulting in a low production of xylose."

However, it is unknown how these many factors and ribosomal proteins associate with pre-rRNA sequentially.Here we screened genes with products that interact with Ebp2p, the yeast homolog of human Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1-binding protein 2. We previously demonstrated that Ebp2p is essential for maturation of 25 S rRNA and assembly of 60 S ribosomal subunits (14Tsujii R. Miyoshi K. Tsuno A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K.

We also demonstrate that YIL019w, named FAF1 (40 S assembly factor), encodes a novel factor essential for pre-rRNA processing and 40 S subunit assembly.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Construction—pGEM-T-FAF1 was constructed as follows. A PCR fragment of FAF1, including its upstream and downstream regions, was produced from yeast genomic DNA using the primers 5′-CGGGATCCTCAATTCTCTGAAAGTGTCAG-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGACTTTGATAGCCAACGTCATTCATAAG-3′ and ligated into the pGEM-T vector. The FAF1 fragment in pGEM-T-FAF1 was cloned as a BamHI-SalI fragment into pRS316 (16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pRS316-FAF1. pRS314-GAL1-myc-BS, a pRS314-based (16Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) expression vector that contains the GAL1 promoter, the three-Myc epitope-encoding region just downstream of the initiation codon, a multicloning site, and the TDH3 terminator, was kindly provided by Dr. K. Tanaka. pRS314-GAL-myc-FAF1 was constructed by inserting the BamHI-SmaI PCR fragment of the FAF1 open reading frame (from the first ATG to the stop codon), produced from yeast genomic DNA with the primers 5′-CGGGATCCATGACCCTTGATGATGACGAC-3′ and 5′-TCCCCGGGTGCGACGGGATTTCTTTTTGCC-3′ into the BamHI and SmaI sites of pRS314-GAL1-myc-BS. A plasmid expressing Myc-tagged Faf1p by own promoter, pRS314-myc-FAF1, was constructed by replacing the SacI-EcoRI region of the GAL1 promoter of pRS314-GAL-myc-FAF1 with the SacI-EcoRI PCR fragment of the upstream promoter region of FAF1 (1045 bp) produced from yeast genomic DNA with primers (5′-CGGAGCTCATTCCATCTACAGCAGTCTTC-3′ and 5′-GCGAATTCCTTTTTATGGCTTTTGGGTCA-3′). A plasmid expressing Nop1p-GFP in the YCplac33 vector, YCplac33-NOP1-GFP, was kindly provided by Dr. Y.

Yeast cells were grown in YPD (yeast, peptone, dextrose) medium, YPGal (yeast, peptone, galactose) medium, synthetic complete medium containing 2% glucose (SC) or 2% galactose (SCGal), or SC dropout medium, depending on the plasmid markers (17Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). For plasmid shuffling, 0.87 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid was added to SC medium. Yeast transformation was performed by a lithium acetate procedure (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Strain Construction—pGEM-T-FAF1::LEU2 was created by replacing the Aor51HI-EcoRV fragment of pGEM-T-FAF1 with the LEU2 gene.

Secondary antibodies (rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, Inc.; fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) were diluted 1:300. Nuclear DNA was stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 μg/ml, Sigma).Polysome Analysis—Yeast cells were grown in 100 ml of medium to mid-log phase (optical density at 600 nm = 0.7) and harvested immediately following the addition of cycloheximide (100 μg/ml). The pellet was washed twice with CH buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 50 μg of cycloheximide/ml, 200 μg of heparin/ml) and suspended in 0.5 ml of CH buffer.

[methyl-3H]Methionine pulse-chase analysis was performed as described previously (24Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Yoshida H. Maki Y. Wada A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mizuta K. J. Biol.

Briefly, yeast cultures in SC-Met were pulsed with [methyl-3H]methionine (10 μCi/ml) for 3 min and chased with nonradioactive methionine (500 μg/ml). Samples were taken by pouring cultures onto crushed sterile ice to prepare total RNA. Ten μg of total RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis and blotted to a Nytran membrane. The upper part of the membrane was sprayed with En3Hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film for 5 days. The lower part of the membrane was probed for U3 snoRNA.Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed following standard techniques, and signals were visualized by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) as instructed by the manufacturer.

A data base search revealed that DNA sequences from Schizo-saccharomyces pombe and Neurospora crassa can encode proteins with significant similarity to Faf1p with identity of 23.1 and 21.7%, respectively (data not shown). A FAF1-null allele was created by replacing the Aor51HI-EcoRV fragment of FAF1 with the LEU2 gene. The DNA fragment containing the FAF1::LEU2 disruption was used to transform diploid W303. Disruption was confirmed by PCR (data not shown). Thirtythree tetrads from the transformant of W303 were dissected, of which 31 tetrads yielded two viable spores, and 2 tetrads yielded only one viable spore. All viable spores were Leu-, indicating that FAF1 is essential for vegetative growth (data not shown).To learn the subcellular localization of Faf1p, we constructed a plasmid to express Faf1p tagged with three repeats of the Myc epitope at the N terminus. The single copy plasmid containing myc-FAF1 expressed from its own promoter complemented the lethality of the faf1 null mutation, indicating that the construct is biologically functional. Western blotting with anti-Myc antibodies detected Myc-Faf1p as a band with an apparent molecular mass of 61.0 kDa (Fig. 2C), somewhat larger than the predicted molecular mass of the protein with three repeats of the Myc tag (43.3 kDa). The subcellular localization of Myc-Faf1p was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1). Nop1p-GFP, used as a marker for the nucleolus, was detected in the region adjacent to the 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nucleoplasm. A weak signal of Myc-Faf1p was detected throughout the cell, and a dense signal was seen in the same region as Nop1p-GFP. Thus, Faf1p is primarily localized in the nucleolus, although some Faf1p may be present in the nucleoplasm and in the cytoplasm.Fig. 1Faf1p is enriched in the nucleolus. Intracellular localization of Myc-Faf1p detected by indirect immunofluorescence. KM807 (myc-FAF1 NOP1-GFP) strain cells were grown in SC medium at 30 °C to early log phase. Cells were stained with anti-Myc, anti-GFP antibodies, and 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The morphology of the cells was observed by differential interference contrast (DIC). Arrowheads indicate the boundary between the chromatin region and the nucleolus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FAF1 Is Required for 40 S Subunit Assembly—To achieve conditional expression of FAF1, we constructed a strain in which the chromosomal FAF1 gene was disrupted and expression of Myc-Faf1p was driven by the GAL1 promoter expressed in galactose but not glucose. This strain, KM804, could grow on YPG-galactose media but not on YPD-glucose media (Fig. 2A). In liquid galactose medium, KM804 cells grow with a longer doubling time than wild-type cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting that overexpression of Faf1p results in a growth defect. When KM804 was shifted from galactose to glucose medium, cell growth slowed gradually at 10 h after the shift (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis using anti-Myc antibodies revealed that expression level of Myc-Faf1p decreased to wild-type levels 4 h after the shift from galactose to glucose medium and significantly decreased 8–10 h after the shift (Fig. 2C).The effect of depletion of Faf1p on ribosome biogenesis was examined by using this strain. We performed sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation using cell extracts with equal A260 units. The polysome profile of the strain KM804 that was cultured in glucose medium for 14 h exhibited a significant accumulation of 60 S ribosomal subunits (Fig. 3A). The profile of ribosomal subunits clearly revealed that the level of 40 S subunits decreased compared with the level of 60 S subunits in the Faf1p-depleted cells (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that FAF1 is required for 40 S ribosomal subunit assembly. Interestingly, overexpression of Faf1p appeared to have little effect on the profiles of either polysomes or subunits, although it caused significant growth inhibition.Fig. 3Faf1p depletion causes a defect in assembly of 40S ribosomal subunits. The polysome profiles after sucrose density gradient centrifugation from wild-type W303a (WT (a)) and KM804 (GAL-FAF1 (b)) strains cultured in SCGal and 14 h after shift to SC under low salt (100 mm NaCl) (A) and high salt (1.0 m KCl) conditions (B). The positions of 40, 60, and 80 S ribosomal particles and polysomes are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FAF1 Is Required for Maturation of 18 S rRNA—We performed [methyl-3H]methionine pulse-chase analysis to investigate whether the depletion of Faf1p caused a defect in pre-rRNA processing. The 35 S pre-rRNA, the longest detectable precursor, is cleaved to the 27 S and the 20 S pre-rRNAs, which are further processed to the mature 25 and 18 S rRNAs, respectively (Fig. 4A). In wild-type cells, most precursor rRNAs were processed to 25 S and 18 S after a 3-min chase in both galactose and glucose medium (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–8). On the other hand, in the Faf1p-depleted cells, the processing rate of the 35 S pre-rRNA was slower than that of the wild-type cells, and a significantly smaller amount of the mature 18 S rRNA was produced, whereas the amount of 25 S rRNA produced in the Faf1p-depleted cells appeared to be greater than that in the wild-type cells under the experimental conditions (Fig. 4B, lanes 13–16). When KM804 (GAL-FAF1) cells were cultured in galactose medium, amounts of 25 and 18 S rRNAs similar to those in wild-type cells were produced after a 20-min chase, although processing of pre-rRNA appeared to be slower than in wild-type cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 9–12). Northern analysis showed the steady state levels of the mature rRNAs and pre-rRNAs in wild-type and Faf1p-depleted cells after the shift to glucose medium for various periods of time (Fig. 4C). Following transfer of the GAL-FAF1 strain to glucose medium, abnormal 23 S RNA was detected, and the steady state levels of both 20 S rRNA and mature 18 S rRNA were reduced with time of incubation in glucose medium. On the other hand, the levels of 27 S pre-rRNA and mature 25 S rRNA were apparently unchanged by depletion of Faf1p. The amount of 18 S rRNA was reduced to 22%, and that of 25 S rRNA to 87% after 24 h culture in glucose medium (Fig. 4C, d). These results are consistent with the result of the [methyl-3H]methionine pulse-chase analysis (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Faf1p depletion causes a defect in 18 S rRNA maturation.

Total RNA equivalent to 0.25 A600 of cells was used for Northern blot analysis. Northern blot analysis was carried out using 32P-labeled DNA probes (a, probe a; b, probe b; c, probe c; d, probes d and e) and snoRNA U3. 25 and 18 S rRNA levels (d) were quantified using a BAS-1800 (Fuji Photo Film Co.) and normalized with the U3 level; the ratio of the radioactivity value at each point per that at time zero serves as percent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Two-hybrid Interactions among Ebp2p, Faf1p, Utp11p, and Rps16p—As FAF1, UTP11, and RPS16A were isolated in two-hybrid screening by using EBP2 as bait, we next determined two-hybrid interactions among these gene products. Interestingly, each combination of these genes exhibited positive two-hybrid interaction (Fig. 5), indicating that Faf1p interacts with both Utp11p and Rps16p, and Utp11p also interacts with Rps16p.Fig. 5Faf1p, Utp11p, and Rps16p have two-hybrid interactions with each other.

EBP2 was first identified in our two-hybrid screening by using RRS1 as bait (14Tsujii R. Miyoshi K. Tsuno A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). RRS1 was originally isolated as the gene responsible for signal transduction for transcriptional repression of ribosomal genes resulting from a secretion block (22Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2493-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We determined that Rrs1p is an Rpl11p-binding protein and has a role in the maturation of 25 S rRNA and in the assembly of the 60 S ribosomal subunit (22Tsuno A. Miyoshi K. Tsujii R. Miyakawa T.

We also demonstrated that Ebp2p has an essential role in 60 S ribosomal subunit biogenesis (14Tsujii R. Miyoshi K. Tsuno A. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Miyakawa T. Mizuta K. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this screening, we obtained nine genes that are involved in ribosome biogenesis. Besides 60 S assembly factors, Ebp2p interacts with Utp11p, an essential factor of 40 S ribosomal subunit biogenesis, Rps16p, a component of 40 S subunit, and Yil019w, a protein for which the function was previously uncharacterized. We demonstrated that YIL019w is required for 40 S biogenesis, naming it FAF1.During transcription of 35 S pre-rRNA, a large nucleolar U3 RNP complex assembles at the 5′ end of the nascent pre-rRNA, corresponding to the terminal knobs in chromatin spreads (32Mougey E.B.

https://openalex.org/W1981088290,"The EEN (extra eleven nineteen) gene was originally cloned from a case of acute myeloid leukemia M5 subtype with translocation t (11; 19)(q23; p13), in which EEN was fused with MLL. To explore the involvement of EEN in leukemogenesis caused by MLL-EEN, we studied the transformation potential of the MLL-EEN fusion protein. MLL-EEN had oncogenic features, while, as a control, MLLΔ, the truncated form of MLL lacking the EEN moiety, did not show any oncogenic potential. MLL-EEN exerted a dominant-negative effect over wild-type EEN in terms of subcellular localization. Normally, EEN was found in the cytoplasm, but the MLL-EEN fusion protein was located in the nucleus, and EEN could be delocalized by MLL-EEN. This interaction is via a coiled-coil dimerization domain of EEN, which is reserved in the fusion protein. In addition, MLL-EEN might act as a potential transcriptional factor with the MLL part providing the DNA-binding domain and the EEN part providing the transcription activation domain, though EEN seems to have no direct role in transcriptional regulation. As an aberrant transcriptional factor, MLL-EEN could transactivate the promoter of HoxA7, a potential target gene of MLL."
https://openalex.org/W1993676814,"To delineate the role of peptide backbone flexibility and rapid molecular motion in acetylcholinesterase catalysis and inhibitor association, we investigated the decay of fluorescence anisotropy at three sites of fluorescein conjugation to cysteine-substitution mutants of the enzyme. One cysteine was placed in a loop at the peripheral site near the rim of the active center gorge (H287C); a second was in a helical region outside of the active center gorge (T249C); a third was at the tip of a small, flexible ω loop well separated from the gorge (A262C). Mutation and fluorophore conjugation did not appreciably alter catalytic or inhibitor binding parameters of the enzyme. The results show that each site examined was associated with a high degree of segmental motion; however, the A262C and H287C sites were significantly more flexible than the T249C site. Association of the active center inhibitor, tacrine, and the peripheral site peptide inhibitor, fasciculin, had no effect on the anisotropy decay of fluorophores at positions 249 and 262. Fasciculin, but not tacrine, on the other hand, dramatically altered the decay profile of the fluorophore at the 287 position, in a manner consistent with fasciculin reducing the segmental motion of the peptide chain in this local region. The results suggest that the motions of residues near the active center gorge and across from the Cys69-Cys96 ω loop are uncoupled and that ligand binding at the active center or the peripheral site does not influence acetylcholinesterase conformational dynamics globally, but induces primarily domain localized decreases in flexibility proximal to the bound ligand.

Biopolymers. 2000; 53: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Alternative portals have been proposed as routes for access or removal of H2O, H+, or products (9Gilson M.K. Straatsma T.P.

Biopolymers. 1999; 50: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); however, the finding that mutations in the vicinity of the proposed alternative portals do not alter steady-state catalytic parameters argues against a second access route being a rate-limiting step (12Kronman C. Ordentlich A. Barak D. Velan B. Shafferman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27819-27822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Faerman C. Ripoll D. Bon S. Le Feuvre Y. Morel N. Massoulie J. Sussman J.L. Silman I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 386: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamic simulations have pointed to flexibility and/or fluctuations in gating that may enhance accessibility to the active center (14Zhou H.X. Wlodek S.T. McCammon J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9280-9283Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 15Shen T.Y. Tai K. McCammon J.A. Phys. Rev. E Stat. Nonlin. Soft Matter Phys. 2001; 63: 041902Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A 10-ns molecular dynamic simulation of mouse AChE analyzed in terms of projections on the principal components suggests that collective motions on many time scales contribute to the opening of the gorge (16Tai K. Shen T. Borjesson U. Philippopoulos M. McCammon J.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 715-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Residues at the gorge opening and constriction point generally have larger correlation vectors pointing away from the gorge than do residues located peripheral to the gorge, suggesting large amplitude gorge opening motions. Although molecular dynamic simulations support the existence of a conformationally active gorge, little experimental support exists. Analysis of the various published crystal structures of the apo and ligand-bound enzyme from various sources yield no indication that the gorge exists in “open” and “closed” states. On the other hand, Laue crystallography, with its diminished exposure time of x-ray radiation, has the potential to detect short lifetime intermediates in formation of AChE complexes (17Ravelli R.B. Raves M.L. Ren Z. Bourgeois D. Roth M. Kroon J. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, we have reported that both active center and peripheral site inhibitors alter dramatically the emission maxima of acrylodan conjugated to mouse AChE cysteine mutants (18Shi J. Boyd A.E. Radić Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42196-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because many of the affected residues do not directly contact the bound ligand, the findings reveal ligand-dependent conformational changes in the Cys69-Cys96 ω-loop, which forms one of the walls of the active center gorge (18Shi J. Boyd A.E. Radić Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42196-42204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Shi J. Radić Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43301-43308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Additionally, we have found substantial internal flexibility at this ω-loop as well as changes in flexibility induced by ligand binding (20Shi J. Tai K. McCammon J.A. Taylor P. Johnson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30905-30911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To extend our observations on the AChE conformational dynamics to additional areas around the active center gorge, we measured the effects of two inhibitors on the backbone flexibility of three surface sites across the active center gorge from the Cys69-Cys96 ω-loop using site-directed labeling in combination with time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy. Specifically, we chose three aligned sites for cysteine substitution and fluorescein conjugation, starting at the rim of the gorge (H287C), extending radially to an adjacent surface α-helix (T249C), and then to the tip of a small and mobile ω-loop (A262C), some 20 Å away from the gorge rim (Fig. 1). Timeresolved fluorescence anisotropy yields information on the excited state of the fluorophore in the picosecond to nanosecond time frame (21Steiner R.F. Lakowicz J.R. Topics in Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2. Plenum Press, New York1991Google Scholar), a time domain much shorter than the AChE catalytic cycle. With this approach we hoped to assess the basic characteristics of the motion at sites near the gorge but across from the Cys69-Cys96 ω-loop. We reasoned that if the opening motions were conformationally linked, ligand association, which would influence peptidyl backbone flexibility adjacent to the bound ligand, should also affect motion and flexibility parameters at more distal loci. The results reveal distinct modes of molecular motion in the individual regions examined. Also, the very limited effects of ligand binding upon anisotropy decay suggest uncoupled movements of the regions examined, a finding consistent with a model for transient gorge openings that is dominated by random segmental movements. Materials—Acetylthiocholine iodide, 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Ellman's reagent), dithiothreitol, and tacrine (9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine hydrochloride hydrate) were purchased from Sigma. Fluorescein 5-maleimide (FM) and 5-iodoacetaminofluorescein (IAF) were obtained from Molecular Probes. Fasciculin 2 (purified from the venom of Dendroaspis angusticeps) was a gift of Dr. Pascale Marchot (University of Marseille, France). Drs. Yacov Ashani and Bhupendra P. Doctor (Walter Reed Army Research Center, Washington, D. C.) kindly provided 7-[[(methylethoxy)phosphinyl]-oxyl]-1-methylquinolinium iodide. All other chemicals came from commercial sources and were, at least, reagent grade. Enzyme Preparation—Mutagenesis procedures to generate the cysteine-substituted mutants are described elsewhere (22Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNAs encoding a monomeric form of the mouse enzyme truncated at position 548 were placed in the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and were subjected to PCR-mediated (QuikChange™, Stratagene) mutagenesis. Restriction enzyme analyses allowed detection of the mutations. To ensure the absence of spurious mutations, cassettes encompassing the mutated site were subcloned into pcDNA3 vectors that had not been exposed to the mutagenesis procedure, and their nucleotide sequences were verified by double stranded sequencing. Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells, purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish, 24 h prior to transfection. Standard HEPES/calcium phosphate precipitation methods were used to apply 10 μg of plasmid DNA per plate to the cell monolayers. The next day, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and supplied with serum-free media for continued growth (Ultraculture, Bio-Whitaker, Walkersville, MD). Large scale productions of mutant enzymes entailed creation of stable cell lines that exhibited G418 (Gemini Bio-Products, Woodland, CA) resistance following cotransfection with a neomycin resistance gene as described elsewhere (22Boyd A.E. Marnett A.B. Wong L. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22401-22408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Radić Z. Pickering N.A. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Harvests of mutant AChE in serum-free media from confluent cells in three-tiered flasks (Nalge Nunc Int., Rochester, NY) typically continued for several weeks after which expression levels began to decline. Affinity chromatography with trimethyl (m-aminophenyl)ammonium linked through a long tether arm to Sepharose CL-4B resin (Sigma) permitted one-step purification of AChE, both mutant and wild-type in amounts between 5 and 25 mg, as previously described (24Berman J.D. Young M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 25De la Hoz D. Doctor B.P. Ralston J.S. Rush R.S. Wolfe A.D.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 672-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and by comparisons of specific activity with absorbance at 280 nm to measure protein concentration (ϵ280 = 1.14 × 105m-1 cm-1 (27Taylor P. Jones J.W. Jacobs N.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1974; 10: 78-92PubMed Google Scholar)). Catalytic Activity—The catalytic activity of each unlabeled and labeled mutant was measured with the Ellman assay (28Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V.J. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21694) Google Scholar). Km and Kss (the dissociation constant of a ternary complex resulting in substrate inhibition or activation) were evaluated as described in previous kinetic schemes (23Radić Z. Pickering N.A. Vellom D.C. Camp S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12074-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The x intercept of a plot of the residual catalytic activity versus the concentration of the irreversible inhibitor 7-[[(methylethoxy)-phosphinyl]-oxyl]-1-methylquinolinium iodide yielded the enzyme concentration, and, in turn, kcat (29Levy D. Ashani Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Fluorescein Labeling—The mutant enzymes were pretreated with 0.25 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature to ensure that all of the free cysteines were reduced, and free dithiothreitol was removed with a G-50 Sephadex spin column (Roche Diagnostics) equilibrated in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. FM and IAF were dissolved in dimethylformamide to make stock concentrations between 6 and 15 mm. The thioreactive probes, FM and IAF, at 100 times the enzyme concentration, were added to the enzyme solutions to achieve either a 3-fold molar excess in the case of the A262C mutant or a 20-fold molar excess in the case of the T249C and H287C mutants. Labeling was allowed to proceed for 12 h at 4 °C for the A262C mutant and for 2 h at 37 °C for the T249C and H287C mutants. Unconjugated fluorescein derivatives were removed by gel-filtration with G-25 Sephadex (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Parallel labeling reactions with wild-type mouse AChE were performed to assess nonspecific labeling. Stoichiometries of fluorescein-labeled mutants were estimated spectrophotometrically by substitution of the measured absorbance values at 280 nm (A280) and 495 nm (A495) into the following expression. [Fluorescein][AChE]=A495/83,000(A280−0.18A495)/114,000 Eq. 1 Steady-state Emission—Steady-state emission spectra were measured at room temperature using a FluoroMax II spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ). Time-resolved Fluorescence Anisotropy—Emission anisotropy was determined by time-correlated single photon-counting measurements (30Yguerabide J. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 26: 498-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) with an IBH (Edinburgh, UK) 480-nm NanoLED™ flash lamp run at 1 MHz and IBH model TBX-04 photon detector. The vertically [I∥(t)] and orthogonally [I⊥(t)] polarized emission components were collected by exciting samples with vertically polarized light while orienting the emission polarizer (Polaroid HNPNB dichroic film) in either a vertical or orthogonal direction. Excitation and emission bands were selected with an Oriel 500-nm short-pass interference filter (catalog number 59876) and a Corning 3-68 cut on filter with a half-maximum transmission of 540 nm, respectively. Typically, 2 × 104 peak counts were collected (in 1-2 min) when the emission polarizer was vertically oriented. The orthogonal emission decay profile was generated over the same time interval that was used to generate the vertical emission decay profile. Samples were held at 22 °C. To minimize convolution artifacts, flash lamp profiles were recorded by removing the emission filter and monitoring light scatter from a suspension of latex beads. The data analysis software corrected the wavelength-dependent temporal dispersion of the photoelectrons by the photomultiplier. The polarization bias (G) of the detection instrumentation was determined by measuring the integrated photon counts/6 × 106 lamp flashes while the samples were excited with orthogonally polarized light and the emission was monitored with a polarizer oriented in the vertical and orthogonal directions (G = 1.028). The emission anisotropy decay, r(t), given by the expression, r(t)=I|(t)−G⋅I⊥(t)I∥(t)+2G⋅I⊥(t) Eq. 2 and total emission decay, S(t), for a macroscopically isotropic sample, S(t)=I|(t)+2G⋅I⊥(t) Eq. 3 were deconvolved simultaneously from the individual polarized emission components expressed as, I|=S(t)3[1+2r(tq)] Eq. 4 and the following. I⊥(t)=S(t)3[1−r(t)] Eq. 5 Thus, both I∥(t) and I⊥(t) are determined by the same fitting functions, S(t) and r(t), and fitting parameters. The fluorescence lifetimes for each sample were determined by initially generating a total emission decay profile from I∥(t) and I⊥(t) with Equation 3 and then globally fitting I∥(t) and I⊥(t) decay profiles to Equations 4 and 5 with the lifetime parameters fixed and with the following anisotropy decay expression. r(t)=r0fxbexp(−t/ϕfast)+r0(1−fxb)exp(−t/ϕslow) Eq. 6 Here, r0 is the amplitude of the anisotropy at time 0, fxb is the fraction of the anisotropy decay associated with the fast decay processes, and ϕ is the rotational correlation time of the anisotropy decay. The subscripts fast and slow denote the fast and slow decay processes, respectively. A nonassociative model was assumed, indicating that the emission relaxation times are common to all the rotational correlation times. The fluorescence data were analyzed using the Globals software package developed at the Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Goodness of fit was evaluated from the values of the reduced χr2 and by visual inspection of the weighted-residual plots. To better define the uncertainty of the measured slow, presumably whole body, rotational correlation times, a range (not a mean ± S.D.) of ϕslow values was determined for each data set that produced a reasonably acceptable fit to the anisotropy decay. Specifically, a unidimensional search procedure was performed that involved directed searches along the ϕslow parameter axis, not allowing other fitting parameters to vary, to find the minimum and maximum ϕslow values that raised the χr2 values by 5%. Estimation of Stokes' Radius—The Stokes' radius of wild-type AChE was estimated by gel filtration with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.1 m ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.2. The elution volumes of wild-type AChE and proteins with known Stokes' radii were measured. The estimated value of the wild-type AChE Stokes' radius of wild-type AChE was read from a curve derived using the known Stokes' radii and the elution parameters of the standards, following the equation of Porath (31Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). Molecular Dynamic Simulations of FM-H287C Mutant—A series of short, 3-ps molecular dynamic simulations were performed on the mouse AChE-fasciculin complex coordinates (Protein Data Bank code 1KU6) with FM attached to Cys287 to assess the effects of bound fasciculin on the torsional rotation of the succinimidylthioether (maleimide) tether arm connecting the fluorescein reporter group to the α-carbonyl backbone. The hydrogens were added in InsightII prior to calculations, and the pH was set to 7.0. Sets of 21 molecular dynamic simulations were run with an SGI Octane computer (Silicongraphics, Inc., Mountain View, CA) using the Discover 2.9 module within the InsightII 2000.1 computer program (Accelrys, San Diego, CA), both in the presence and absence of fasciculin. With the exception of the 19 AChE residues (from Gln279 to Phe297) forming a surface loop, including FM attached to Cys287, all the atoms of mouse AChE and fasciculin were “frozen” during simulation. No water was present, the dielectric constant was set to 80, and the structure was not minimized prior to the subsequent molecular dynamic simulations. The protocol included initial equilibration of the system at 300 K, heating to 700 K, then slow cooling in 50-K increments back to 300 K, followed by minimization of the system. Characterization of Unlabeled and Labeled Mutants—SDS-PAGE analysis of the labeled and unlabeled mutants revealed a single, wide band of silver staining migrating with the variably glycosylated wild-type mouse AChE. Comparison of the steady-state emission from labeled mutants and parallel, wild-type AChE showed 6-7% nonspecific labeling. Based upon spectrophotometric ratios, stoichiometries of labeling for the labeled mutants were: T249C, 0.2 ± 0.04; A262C, 0.4 ± 0.1; and H287C, 0.3 ± 0.06. The Km, Kss, and kcat values for the cysteine mutants, the conjugated cysteine mutants, and wild-type AChE preparations were within experimental error of each other (data not shown). Because labeling was not stoichiometric, we also looked for a fractional component in the substrate concentration dependence curves that showed a different Km, but were unable to detect two components in the curves. Moreover, titration with both tacrine and fasciculin produced virtually complete inhibition of catalytic activity of the labeled mutants with similar KI values as observed for the wild-type AChE. Together, these findings indicate that labeled mutants fold correctly despite cysteine substitution and reporter group conjugation at these positions. Fluorescence Emission—The uncorrected emission (517 ± 1 nm) and excitation (494 ± 1 nm) maxima for the conjugated enzymes are typical of fluorescein in an aqueous environment. Neither fasciculin nor tacrine had a significant effect upon the excitation or emission spectra of either the T249C or A262C conjugates; however, fasciculin red shifted slightly (2-3 nm) the emission spectrum and enhanced the apparent quantum yield by ∼12% of the IAF-labeled H287C mutant, indicating a ligand-induced change of the microenvironment around the reporter group attached to the H287C site of conjugation (data not shown). Estimation of Rotational Correlation Times—From the gel filtration measurements, wild-type AChE was estimated to have a Stokes' radius of 51 Å. Substituting this value into the Stokes-Einstein equation yielded a rotational correlation time of 128 ns. Time-resolved Fluorescence Anisotropy of FM Conjugates—For brevity, the emission and the anisotropy decay profiles of only the FM-T249C conjugate are illustrated (Fig. 2). The time course of emission decay of each mutant examined was well fit to a biexponential decay model. For simplicity, only the geometric averaged excited state lifetimes are summarized (Table I) and ranged between 4.11 and 4.26 ns. The actual range of short and long wavelength emission lifetimes for the various nonliganded mutants were 4.26-4.82 and 2.98-4.01 ns, respectively. The amplitudes of the longer lifetime components ranged between 31 and 87% of the total decay amplitude (data not shown).Table IEffect of fasciculin and tacrine on the anisotropy decay parameters of FM-labeled mouse AChE mutantsMutantInhibitorr0aThe time 0 anisotropy.fxbbThe fraction of the observed anisotropy decay associated with the fast depolarization processes.φfastcFast rotational correlation time.φslowdThe range of the slow rotational correlation times that yield ϰr values 5% above the minimum.ψr2eThe reduced ϰ2.τfGeometric averaged lifetimes (Σαiτi, where Σαi = 1).nsnsnsT249CNone0.30 ± 0.010.32 ± 0.011.2 ± 0.234-491.34.25 ± 0.01Fasciculin0.30 ± 0.010.33 ± 0.011.3 ± 0.335-491.34.16 ± 0.01Tacrine0.31 ± 0.030.33 ± 0.011.0 ± 0.433-481.24.26 ± 0.01A262CNone0.29 ± 0.030.47 ± 0.010.8 ± 0.241-721.54.26 ± 0.01Fasciculin0.29 ± 0.020.47 ± 0.010.8 ± 0.243-711.44.27 ± 0.01Tacrine0.28 ± 0.020.46 ± 0.010.8 ± 0.240-631.54.27 ± 0.01H287CNone0.30 ± 0.010.50 ± 0.010.9 ± 0.131-441.34.11 ± 0.01Fasciculin0.30 ± 0.010.34 ± 0.011.8 ± 0.136-491.24.28 ± 0.02Tacrine0.32 ± 0.030.49 ± 0.010.9 ± 0.229-411.44.10 ± 0.01a The time 0 anisotropy.b The fraction of the observed anisotropy decay associated with the fast depolarization processes.c Fast rotational correlation time.d The range of the slow rotational correlation times that yield ϰr values 5% above the minimum.e The reduced ϰ2.f Geometric averaged lifetimes (Σαiτi, where Σαi = 1). Open table in a new tab Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy directly monitors the reorientation of the emission transition dipole moment of a fluorescent reporter group in the picosecond/nanosecond time domain. When conjugated to a specific protein side chain, the I∥(t) and I⊥(t) emission profiles are usually well fit to a model-free nonassociative biexponential equation (Equation 6). Under conditions where the protein-conjugated reporter group diffuses relatively freely at the end of its tether arm and where there are no significant internal motions in the time domain between the whole body diffusion and local backbone movements, the main types of motions (tether arm, local backbone, and whole body) should be resolvable from each other and are represented in the basic elements of the biexponential equation (time 0 amplitude, r0), the rotational correlation time, and fractional amplitude of the fast components (ϕfast and fxb) and slow rotational correlation time (ϕslow) processes (32Gangal M. Cox S. Lew J. Clifford T. Garrod S.M. Aschbaher M. Taylor S.S. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13728-13735Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present case, the whole body rotational correlation time predicted by the Stokes-Einstein equation (128 ns) is slower than the observed ϕslow values, which ranged between 31 and 72 ns (Table I). This disparity may reflect the existence of internal motions of intermediate decay rates that obscure the depolarization from whole body rotational diffusion or arise from the inherent limitation of quantifying rotational diffusion times that are more than 10 times slower than the emission lifetime of the reporter group. Visual comparison of the time-resolved anisotropy decays of the three mutants (Fig. 3) shows that the fluorescein attached to A262C and H287C mutants reorients (depolarizes) more rapidly than the fluorescein attached to the T249C mutant, but with similar time 0 anisotropy values. Quantitatively, these similarities and differences were primarily observed in the fractional amplitude of the measurable fast decay processes (fxb). The fxb values for the FM-A262C and FM-H287C conjugates represent about half of the resolvable anisotropy decay (0.47 and 0.50, respectively), but only a third (0.32) of the FM-T249C mutant. The values for the time 0 anisotropy (r0; range 0.29-0.30) and the fast rotational correlation time (ϕfast; range 0.8-1.2 ns) were essentially the same for all the mutants studied. Taken together, these results indicate a high level of α-carbon flexibility around each residue examined, although the Thr249 residue is significantly less flexible than the Ala262 and His287 residues. Influence of Ligand Binding on Anisotropy Decay of FM Conjugates—Active and peripheral site inhibitors, tacrine and fasciculin, respectively, were bound to AChE at a concentration of at least 100 times their dissociation constants to ensure >99% occupation (23Radić Z.

Specifically, fasciculin reduced the amplitude of the fast decay"
https://openalex.org/W2086886635,"Gliomas are among the most malignant and most highly vascularized human tumors. We studied the therapeutic action of an angiostatic fragment of human thrombospondin 1 (named TSP1ang) on experimental glioma tumor growth. TSP1ang (enclosing amino acids 167–569) comprised the procollagen-homology domain and the three type I repeats of the original molecule. C6 glioma cells that stably express TSP1ang were generated, and their rate of in vitro growth did not appear to differ from that of C6 cells transfected with an empty plasmid. TSP1ang-expressing C6 cells were then injected either subcutaneously or intracerebrally into nude mice. The resulting tumors appeared to be less vascularized, but unexpectedly started to grow earlier and had a much more invasive phenotype than tumors derived from control C6 cells. They were also much more aggressive, since the mice bearing intracerebral TSP1ang-expressing tumor cells died before day 19 post-implantation, whereas all mice bearing control C6 tumors were alive at this time point. These results indicate that careful attention should be paid at designing smaller fragments from the multimodular angiostatic molecule TSP1 since, as observed in this study, it may unmask protumorigenic properties that counteract its antiangiogenic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2056420369,"Identification of the polyamine transporter gene will be useful for modulating polyamine accumulation in cells and should be a good target for controlling cell proliferation. Polyamine transport activity in mammalian cells is critical for accumulation of the polyamine analog methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) that induces apoptosis, although a gene responsible for transport activity has not been identified. Using a retroviral gene trap screen, we generated MGBG-resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to identify genes involved in polyamine transport activity. One gene identified by the method encodes TATA-binding protein-associated factor 7 (TAF7), which functions not only as one of the TAFs, but also a coactivator for c-Jun. TAF7-deficient cells had decreased capacity for polyamine uptake (20% of CHO cells), decreased AP-1 activation, as well as resistance to MGBG-induced apoptosis. Stable expression of TAF7 in TAF7-deficient cells restored transport activity (55% of CHO cells), AP-1 gene transactivation (100% of CHO cells), and sensitivity to MGBG-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of TAF7 in CHO cells did not increase transport activity, suggesting that TAF7 may be involved in the maintenance of basal activity. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase inhibitors blocked MGBG-induced apoptosis without alteration of polyamine transport. Decreased TAF7 expression, by RNA interference, in androgen-independent human prostate cancer LN-CaP104-R1 cells resulted in lower polyamine transport activity (25% of control) and resistance to MGBG-induced growth arrest. Taken together, these results reveal a physiological function of TAF7 as a basal regulator for mammalian polyamine transport activity and MGBG-induced apoptosis. Identification of the polyamine transporter gene will be useful for modulating polyamine accumulation in cells and should be a good target for controlling cell proliferation. Polyamine transport activity in mammalian cells is critical for accumulation of the polyamine analog methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG) that induces apoptosis, although a gene responsible for transport activity has not been identified. Using a retroviral gene trap screen, we generated MGBG-resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells to identify genes involved in polyamine transport activity. One gene identified by the method encodes TATA-binding protein-associated factor 7 (TAF7), which functions not only as one of the TAFs, but also a coactivator for c-Jun. TAF7-deficient cells had decreased capacity for polyamine uptake (20% of CHO cells), decreased AP-1 activation, as well as resistance to MGBG-induced apoptosis. Stable expression of TAF7 in TAF7-deficient cells restored transport activity (55% of CHO cells), AP-1 gene transactivation (100% of CHO cells), and sensitivity to MGBG-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of TAF7 in CHO cells did not increase transport activity, suggesting that TAF7 may be involved in the maintenance of basal activity. c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase inhibitors blocked MGBG-induced apoptosis without alteration of polyamine transport. Decreased TAF7 expression, by RNA interference, in androgen-independent human prostate cancer LN-CaP104-R1 cells resulted in lower polyamine transport activity (25% of control) and resistance to MGBG-induced growth arrest. Taken together, these results reveal a physiological function of TAF7 as a basal regulator for mammalian polyamine transport activity and MGBG-induced apoptosis. Polyamines are ubiquitous cellular components that affect a variety of biochemical processes, especially those involving synthesis of macromolecules (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). The growth of mammalian cells requires polyamines, and the optimal intracellular concentration is regulated by multiple pathways, including synthesis from amino acid precursors, cellular uptake mechanisms, as well as stepwise degradation and efflux.The importance of polyamines for cell proliferation has led to the development of various inhibitors of the biosynthetic pathway or analogs that disrupt normal polyamine functions (2Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 759-774PubMed Google Scholar). One inhibitor, methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) (MGBG), 1The abbreviations used are: MGBG, methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone); CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HA, hemagglutinin; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ORNT2, ornithine transporter 2; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RNAi, RNA interference; TAF7, TATA-binding protein-associated factor 7.1The abbreviations used are: MGBG, methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone); CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CMV, cytomegalovirus; HA, hemagglutinin; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ORNT2, ornithine transporter 2; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RNAi, RNA interference; TAF7, TATA-binding protein-associated factor 7. is a structural analog of the natural polyamine spermidine, and it is a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, an enzyme that supplies propylamino groups for synthesis of spermidine and spermine (3Williams-Ashman H.G. Schenone A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). MGBG is transported into cells by the polyamine transporter (4Heaton M.A. Flintoff W.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 5Byers T.L. Pegg A.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C545-C553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of MGBG in cells induces apoptosis as well as reduction of cellular polyamine levels (6Davidson K. Petit T. Izbicka E. Koester S. Von Hoff D.D. Anticancer Drugs. 1998; 9: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because polyamines are important for cell proliferation, MGBG has been recognized as a potential antineoplastic agent. Despite the long-standing availability of MGBG, the exact mechanism for its cytotoxicity is not clear. Mandel and Flintoff (7Mandel J.L. Flintoff W.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 97: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) reported that MGBG-resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells have decreased polyamine transport activity, indicating that an active mammalian polyamine transport system was a critical factor for the intracellular accumulation of this polyamine analog as well as natural polyamines.Polyamine transport activity can be assayed using radioactive polyamines (8Kakinuma Y. Hoshino K. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and recently, transport activity was visualized using polyamines conjugated to a fluorescent dye (9Cullis P.M. Green R.E. Merson-Davies L. Travis N. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: 717-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although bacterial and/or fungal polyamine transporter genes have been characterized (10Kashiwagi K. Hosokawa N. Furuchi T. Kobayashi H. Sasakawa C. Yoshikawa M. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20893-20897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), the mammalian polyamine transporter gene has not been identified, even though the entire mouse and human genomes have been sequenced. Genetic approaches to identify the mammalian polyamine transporter gene have been tried by several research groups. Adair et al. (12Adair G.M. Siciliano M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) mapped the MGBG resistance locus to part of chromosome Z3 in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and Byers et al. (13Byers T.L. Wechter R. Nuttall M.E. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a human DNA fragment could restore MGBG sensitivity to MGBG-resistant cells. Most recently, using a plasmid base gene targeting vector, Shao et al. (14Shao D. Xiao L. Ha H.C. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) reported a decrease in polyamine transport activity in the human non-small cell lung carcinoma line NCI H157. Despite these efforts, genes responsible for the transport activity have not been identified. Here we report the identification of a gene involved in polyamine transport activity using retroviral gene trap screening and the characterization of its physiological function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Hygromycin B was purchased from Calbiochem. MGBG, spermidine, spermine, ornithine, and Hoechst 33258 were obtained from Sigma. d-JNKI-1 and SP600125 were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego). [α-32P]dCTP (111 TBq/mmol), [14C]spermidine (4.29 GBq/mmol), [14C]spermine (4.07 GBq/mmol), [1-14C] acetyl-CoA (1.89 GBq/mmol), and [1-14C]ornithine (2.05 GBq/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Monoclonal antibody against the HA tag was obtained from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Polyclonal antibodies against cyclin A and eIF-4E were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Cell Culture—Cells were cultured at 37 °C in the indicated media and in the presence of 5% CO2. The Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO-Cl22 (CHO) was cloned by limiting dilution from wild type CHO-K1 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) in our laboratory. For convenience, the parent cells, CHO-Cl22 are described as “CHO cells” in this paper. CHO cells and derivatives were maintained in minimum essential medium-α (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini BioProducts, Woodland, CA), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Gene trap virus-producing cells, ψ2/U3Hygro (15Chang W. Hubbard S.C. Friedel C. Ruley H.E. Virology. 1993; 193: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate. The human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP104-S and 104-R1 cells were passaged and maintained as described previously (16Kokontis J. Takakura K. Hay N. Liao S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1566-1573PubMed Google Scholar).Gene Trap—The retroviral gene trap method was performed as described previously (17von Melchner H. Ruley H.E. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3227-3233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ψ2/U3Hygro cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish. After 18 h, the culture medium was removed, and 2 ml of fresh medium was added. After 2 h, the culture medium was collected and then filtered through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane. This medium containing virus was added to 5 × 105 CHO cells in a 10-cm dish. Polybrene (Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 8 μg/ml, and after incubation for 1 h at 37 °C 10 ml of fresh medium was added. After 18 h, the medium was changed, and hygromycin B was added to 0.6 mm. Hygromycin selection was continued for 10 days, and then hygromycin-resistant colonies were cultured in the presence of 10 μm MGBG. Surviving colonies were picked after a week and expanded in the absence of MGBG.Cell Proliferation Assay—Assays were performed based on the method of Rago et al. (18Rago R. Mitchen J. Wilding G. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 3,000–4,000 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates. After 18 h, MGBG was added without changing the medium. At the indicated time, cells were lysed in distilled water and frozen. Cell lysates were incubated with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 m NaCl. Fluorescence was measured using a Wallac 1420 Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm. A standard curve was generated using CHO cells counted using a hemocytometer.Polyamine Transport Assay—CHO cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate. LNCaP cells were plated at 5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate. The growth medium was aspirated, and transport assay buffer consisting of 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.2, and 10 mm glucose (8Kakinuma Y. Hoshino K. Igarashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the uptake assay was started by the addition of transport assay buffer containing 3.7 kBq of 14C-labeled polyamine so that the final concentration of polyamine was 5 μm. After the indicated incubation time, the buffer was aspirated, and the cells were washed three times with transport assay buffer containing 10 mm unlabeled substrate. Washed cells were lysed in 0.1 n NaOH. Aliquots of lysed cells were used for protein determination with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). After acidification with HCl, radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Uptake measurements were performed under conditions in which uptake was known to be linear with respect to time.Ornithine Decarboxylase, S-Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase, and Spermidine/Spermine N1-Acetyltransferase Assay—Growing cells were harvested, lysed with ornithine decarboxylase buffer (19Kakinuma Y. Sakamaki Y. Ito K. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and dialyzed against 500 ml of ornithine decarboxylase buffer to remove endogenous small molecules. Ornithine decarboxylase (19Kakinuma Y. Sakamaki Y. Ito K. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Igarashi K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 259: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (7Mandel J.L. Flintoff W.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 97: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (20Matsui I. Pegg A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 633: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) activities were measured according to published methods.Measurement of the Cellular Content of Polyamines—Polyamines were extracted from the cells with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Polyamine content was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (21Igarashi K. Kashiwagi K. Hamasaki H. Miura A. Kakegawa T. Hirose S. Matsuzaki S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The cellular content of polyamines was normalized to the amount of total cellular protein determined with the Bradford reagent.Determination of MGBG in CHO Cells—MGBG content was measured according to the method of Seppanen et al. (22Seppanen P. Alhonen-Hongisto L. Poso H. Janne J. FEBS Lett. 1980; 111: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CHO cells were washed three times with the transport assay buffer and then lysed with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Before the determination of MGBG, the cell lysates were boiled for 10 min to inactivate endogenous S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. A homogenate of LNCaP104-S cells was used as a S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase source. The boiled CHO lysates were added to the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase assay system as described. A series of standards containing known amounts of MGBG was run in parallel, and a standard curve was obtained by plotting MGBG concentration versus the reciprocal of initial velocity. The MGBG content in unknown samples was calculated from the standard curve. The MGBG content was normalized to cellular protein content.Southern Blot Analysis—Genomic DNA of CHO cells was isolated as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, fractionated in 0.7% agarose gels, and transferred to a Zetaprobe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). A 32P-labeled DNA probe, containing the EcoRI-XbaI fragment of the TAF7 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) product isolated from pSTBlue-1, was generated by the random priming method using the Prime-It Labeling Kit (Stratagene). Probe hybridization and detection were performed as described previously (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).RACE-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). 5′-RACE was performed with 1 μg of total RNA using a 5′-RACE system kit (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. The specific hygromycin resistance gene primers were 5′-AGCGGGCAGTTCGGTTTCA-3′ for cDNA synthesis and 5′-ACCATCGGCGCAGCTATTTA-3′ for PCR. Using HotStarTaq polymerase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), the following program was used for amplification: preamplification at 95 °C for 15 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min followed by 72 °C for 8 min. The PCR product was cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced. The sequence was then used for primer design for 3′-RACE. mRNA, isolated from CHO-Cl22 cells by using an oligo(dT)-cellulose column, was used for 3′-RACE using a 3′-RACE system kit and Advantage-2 polymerase (Clontech), following the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of specific trapped gene primer and 3′-counterprimer were 5′-GCTCCGCCCGCGAGAAGCCGGTTATAG-3′ and 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′, respectively. The PCR cycle parameters were: preheating at 95 °C for 1 min, 30 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 68 °C for 2 min, followed by 68 °C for 3 min. The PCR product was cloned into the pSTBlue-1 cloning vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the sequence was determined.Northern Blot Analysis—mRNA (5 μg/lane) was size fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to Zetaprobe nylon membranes, and probed with 32P-labeled cDNA, as described for Southern blot analysis.Expression Plasmid Construction—Full-length hamster TAF7 was amplified with 5′-GGATCCGAAGGAACCACCATGAGTAAGAGCAAAGA-3′ (T55-F) and 5′-CTCGAGTCTAAGGACCGAAATCAACAT-3′. After verification by sequencing, the DNA fragment was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Cloning vectors pSG5HA(N-) for amino-terminal HA tagging and pSG5HA(C-) for carboxyl-terminal HA tagging were generated from the pSG5 vector (Stratagene) with the following oligonucleotide DNA pairs: 5′-GATCCATGTACCCATACGACGTGCCAGACTACGCTA-3′ and 5′-GATCTAGCGTAGTCTGGCACGTCGTATGGGTACATG-3′ were for (N-), and 5′-AATTCTATCCATATGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTTAAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTTAAGGGTAGTCTGGGACGTCATATGGATAG-3′ were for (C-). TAF7 was amplified with 5′-GGATCCATGAGTAAGAGCAAAGATGAT-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCTAAGGACCGAAATCAACAT-3′ and cloned into pSG5(N-) so that the HA tag was fused to the amino terminus of TAF7 (TAF7-N). TAF7 was also amplified using T55-F and 5′-GAATTCCTTCTCTAGAAGTGATTCTAGCCCT-3′ and cloned into pSG5(C-) so that the HA tag was fused to the carboxyl terminus of TAF7 (TAF7-C). Finally, these HA-tagged TAF7 genes were subcloned into pcDNA3. Cells stably transformed with these plasmids were generated using the cell transfection agent, Effectene (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions and selection with 0.8 mg/ml G418.Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts were obtained by lysing phosphate-buffered saline-washed cells on the dish with 2× Laemmli gel loading buffer without bromphenol blue dye (16Kokontis J. Takakura K. Hay N. Liao S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1566-1573PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined with Bradford reagent using bovine serum albumin standards as described for the polyamine transport assay. Electrophoresis and blotting were performed essentially as described previously (16Kokontis J. Takakura K. Hay N. Liao S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1566-1573PubMed Google Scholar). All antibodies were used at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml.Reporter Gene Assay—An AP-1-responsive luciferase reporter construct (pGL3-73coll.) was generated from Coll.-73CAT (24Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius H. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), which contains the human collagenase promoter region. Briefly, Coll.-73CAT was digested with HindIII, treated with the Klenow-fragment of DNA polymerase and then cut with BamHI. The resulting DNA fragment was cloned into the BglII/SmaI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were plated at 3 × 104 cells/well on a 24-well plate and grown overnight. Cells were transiently transfected with 0.3 μg of pGL3-73coll. and 0.5 ng of pRL-CMV (normalization reporter plasmid from Promega) using PolyFect (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 6 h the medium was changed, and MGBG was added. After a 24–36-h incubation, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured with a commercial kit (Dual-Luciferase, Promega) on a Monolight Luminometer (Pharmingen, San Diego), and their relative activities were compared.Caspase-3 Assay—Cells were treated as indicated, harvested, and lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10% CHAPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were lysed by freezing and thawing one time. Total cell protein in the cell lysate was measured using Bradford reagent. The caspase-3 substrate, DEVD-AFC (ApoAlert, Clontech) was added to the cellular lysate and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured using a CytoFluor II fluorescence plate reader (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with excitation at 440 nm and emission at 490 nm. The activity was normalized to cellular protein content.RNA Interference (RNAi) Experiments—An RNAi expression vector pH1RP was constructed as follows. The human H1 RNA promoter was amplified from LNCaP104-S genomic DNA using primers 5′-CCATGGAATTCGAACGCTGACGTC-3′ and 5′-GCAAGCTTAGATCTGTGGTCTCATACAGAACTTATAAGATTCCC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pcDNA3 from which the CMV promoter was removed by BamHI-BglII digestion and religation. The RNAi sequence was designed according to the method of Brummelkamp et al. (25Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar) using the design program from OligoEngine (Seattle, WA). The sequences of RNAi for human TAF7 were 5′-GATCCCCTTAGTAGACCTGCCCTGTGTTCAAGAGACACAGGGCAGGTCTACTAATTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAATTAGTAGACCTGCCCTGTGTCTCTTGAACACAGGGCAGGTCTACTAAGGG-3′. These 64-mer oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into the pH1RP vector, and the construct was verified by sequencing. The TAF7-RNAi expression plasmid was stably transfected into LNCaP104-R1 cells using Effectene as described above.Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol Reagent and was treated with DNase I (DNA-free, Ambion, Austin, TX). Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Omniscript, Qiagen). The TaqMan primer/probe was designed using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). The probe for the TAF7 gene was labeled with the fluorescent dye, FAM. The sequence of the forward primer, reverse primer, and TaqMan probe were 5′-CCGTGCAGTCTGGACACGT-3′, 5′-CAATTCCATGACGCCCATC-3′, and 6FAM-5′-AACCTGAAAGACAGACTGACCATTGAGTTACACC-3′-TAMRA, respectively. Real time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 system (Applied Biosystems) using the QuantiTect Probe real time PCR protocol (Qiagen). The Ribosomal RNA Control Kit (Applied Biosystems) was used to normalize transcript levels between samples.RESULTSScreening for MGBG Resistance in CHO Cells Transfected with Gene Trap Retrovirus—Gene trap screening was performed with U3Hygro (15Chang W. Hubbard S.C. Friedel C. Ruley H.E. Virology. 1993; 193: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) to attempt to identify the gene responsible for MGBG resistance and polyamine transport activity. CHO cells were infected with U3Hygro and selected with hygromycin B. CHO cells are functionally hemizygous at a number of loci (26Siminovitch L. Cell. 1976; 7: 1-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), and so a single integration event may result in loss of gene function. The expression of the viral hygromycin resistance gene (hygromycin B phosphotransferase) relies on the activity of the trapped promoter because the hygromycin resistance gene lacks a promoter. Viral gene insertion can disrupt critical controlling elements that can disrupt expression of genes. In theory, a library of 104–105 hygromycin-resistant clones containing proviruses would cover all genes (15Chang W. Hubbard S.C. Friedel C. Ruley H.E. Virology. 1993; 193: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In our gene trap experiment (Fig. 1), we incubated ∼2 × 107 cells with the U3Hygro retrovirus, from which 1 × 105 hygromycin-resistant CHO cell colonies were selected. Chang et al. (15Chang W. Hubbard S.C. Friedel C. Ruley H.E. Virology. 1993; 193: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) found a similar frequency of hygromycin-resistant colonies using the same virus and CHO cells. After further selection with 10 μm MGBG, a concentration that will kill all uninfected CHO cells in 4–5 days (data not shown), a total of 38 colonies survived. Those colonies were picked and amplified for further experimentation. Eventually, only one clone, 432c, showed significant and stable MGBG resistance (Fig. 2A). This frequency of selection (1 MGBG-resistant cell in 105 hygromycin-resistant cells) was similar to the frequency of selection of hemizygous genes in the study by Chang et al. (15Chang W. Hubbard S.C. Friedel C. Ruley H.E. Virology. 1993; 193: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The MGBG-resistant 432c cells also had a significant decrease in polyamine transport activity (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these observations, intracellular accumulation of MGBG (Fig. 2C) or spermine (Fig. 2D) in 432c cells was less than in CHO cells. U3Hygro was used at a fairly low multiplicity of infection (1:1) to allow predominantly one insertion/cell. Previously the locus of MGBG resistance was mapped to a hemizygous region of the Z3 chromosome (12Adair G.M. Siciliano M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), indicating that this function was a single-copy gene (4Heaton M.A. Flintoff W.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 136: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The copy number of the U3 insertion in 432c cells was determined by Southern blot analysis using the neomycin resistance gene as a probe. U3Hygro harbors this gene as a marker for viral infection and insertion (15Chang W. Hubbard S.C. Friedel C. Ruley H.E. Virology. 1993; 193: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA of 432c cells was digested with HindIII, SspI, and StuI, which do not cut U3Hygro, followed by electrophoresis and blotting. The results of Southern blots indicated that the insertion of U3Hygro occurred at only one site (data not shown). It has been reported that the overproduction of ornithine decarboxylase or spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase altered cellular resistance to polyamine analogs that are accumulated through the polyamine transport system, like MGBG (27Suzuki T. He Y. Kashiwagi K. Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28McCloskey D.E. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28708-28714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We measured the enzymatic activities of ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase in 432c cells, and their activities were not significantly changed compared with the parent CHO cell line (data not shown).Fig. 2Characterization of the MGBG-resistant clone, 432c. A, effect of MGBG on cell growth of the parent strain, CHO (closed circles) and 432c cells (open circles). Cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of MGBG for 24 h. The cell number was determined from DNA content/cell using Hoechst 33258. B, spermine uptake activity in CHO (closed circles) and 432c (open circles) cells. Cells were incubated with 5 μm [14C] spermine and uptake measured every 5 min. The activity was normalized to total cellular protein. C, MGBG uptake in CHO (hatched bars) and 432c (open bars) cells. Cells were treated with 3 μm MGBG for the indicated times. Intracellular MGBG content was normalized to total cellular protein. D, effect of additional spermine in media on the intracellular spermine content. Spermine was added to medium at the indicated concentration with 0.5 mm aminoguanidine to inhibit degradation of spermine by serum amine oxidase. After 12 h, cells were collected, and spermine was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography and normalized to total cellular protein. The intracellular spermine content without additional spermine in the medium was 7.23 and 11.1 nmol/mg protein for CHO and 432c cells, respectively, and the spermine content of polyamine-treated cells is shown as a percentage of these control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of TAF7 as the Trapped Gene in 432c Cells— Using total RNA from 432c cells, 5′-RACE was performed with priming from the hygromycin resistance gene (Fig. 1). A 495-bp PCR product was obtained, and this was subcloned and sequenced. Sequencing revealed that 226 nucleotides of CHO cDNA (Fig. 3A) were present. The sequence of this DNA did not match any of the currently available genes from the GenBank data base. No open reading frame was found in this sequence. Because we were unable to identify a gene associated with viral insertion based on 5′-RACE data, we designed DNA p"
