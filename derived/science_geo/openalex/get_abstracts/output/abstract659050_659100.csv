https://openalex.org/W3081741393,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans is often a clinically mild illness, but some individuals develop severe pneumonia, respiratory failure and death1-4. Studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in hamsters5-7 and nonhuman primates8-10 have generally reported mild clinical disease, and preclinical SARS-CoV-2 vaccine studies have demonstrated reduction of viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts in nonhuman primates11-13. Here we show that high-dose intranasal SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters results in severe clinical disease, including high levels of virus replication in tissues, extensive pneumonia, weight loss and mortality in a subset of animals. A single immunization with an adenovirus serotype 26 vector-based vaccine expressing a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein elicited binding and neutralizing antibody responses and protected against SARS-CoV-2-induced weight loss, pneumonia and mortality. These data demonstrate vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 clinical disease. This model should prove useful for preclinical studies of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, therapeutics and pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W3081693490,"Reconstituting autophagosome nucleation To stay healthy, our cells must constantly dispose of harmful material. Autophagy, or self-eating, is an important mechanism to ensure the clearance of bulky material. Such material is enwrapped by cellular membranes to form autophagosomes, the contents of which are then degraded. The formation of autophagosomes is a complicated process involving a large number of factors. How they act together in this process is still enigmatic. Sawa-Makarska et al. recapitulated the initial steps of autophagosome formation using purified autophagy factors from yeast. This approach elucidated some of the organizational principles of the autophagy machinery during the assembly of autophagosomes. Science , this issue p. eaaz7714"
https://openalex.org/W3082930521,"Vertebrates vary in their ability to regenerate, and the genetic mechanisms underlying such disparity remain elusive. Comparative epigenomic profiling and single-cell sequencing of two related teleost fish uncovered species-specific and evolutionarily conserved genomic responses to regeneration. The conserved response revealed several regeneration-responsive enhancers (RREs), including an element upstream to inhibin beta A (inhba), a known effector of vertebrate regeneration. This element activated expression in regenerating transgenic fish, and its genomic deletion perturbed caudal fin regeneration and abrogated cardiac regeneration altogether. The enhancer is present in mammals, shares functionally essential activator protein 1 (AP-1)-binding motifs, and responds to injury, but it cannot rescue regeneration in fish. This work suggests that changes in AP-1-enriched RREs are likely a crucial source of loss of regenerative capacities in vertebrates."

However, how this activity contributes to sleep homeostasis remains largely unknown. Adenosine in the basal forebrain is a prominent physiological mediator of sleep homeostasis. Using a newly developed indicator, Peng et al. monitored adenosine concentration in the mouse basal forebrain. There was a clear correlation with wake state and REM sleep. Activity-dependent release of adenosine could also be elicited after optogenetic stimulation of basal forebrain glutamatergic, but not cholinergic, neurons. These findings offer new insights into how neuronal activity during wakefulness contributes to sleep pressure through the release of sleep-inducing factors. Science , this issue p. eabb0556"
https://openalex.org/W3083393835,"Finding the start Eukaryotic translation involves many players in a dynamic and well-orchestrated process. A 43 S preinitiation complex (PIC) comprises the 40 S ribosomal subunit; initiation factors, including the eIF3 complex, which is known to play a key role; and the transfer RNA used for translation initiation. The PIC is recruited to the cap-binding complex eIF4F at the 5′ end of messenger RNA (mRNA) to form a 48 S complex that scans along the mRNA for a start codon. Brito Querido et al. determined the structure of a reconstituted human 48 S complex using cryo–electron microscopy. They found that eIF4F binds to eIF3 near the exit site of the ribosome. This positioning suggests that downstream mRNA is likely pulled through the 40 S subunit to find the start codon. Science , this issue p. 1220"
https://openalex.org/W3082728825,"Adaptive behaviour crucially depends on flexible decision-making, which in mammals relies on the frontal cortex, specifically the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)1–9. How OFC encodes decision variables and instructs sensory areas to guide adaptive behaviour are key open questions. Here we developed a reversal learning task for head-fixed mice, monitored the activity of neurons of the lateral OFC using two-photon calcium imaging and investigated how OFC dynamically interacts with primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Mice learned to discriminate ‘go’ from ‘no-go’ tactile stimuli10,11 and adapt their behaviour upon reversal of stimulus–reward contingency (‘rule switch’). Imaging individual neurons longitudinally across all behavioural phases revealed a distinct engagement of S1 and lateral OFC, with S1 neural activity reflecting initial task learning, whereas lateral OFC neurons responded saliently and transiently to the rule switch. We identified direct long-range projections from lateral OFC to S1 that can feed this activity back to S1 as value prediction error. This top-down signal updated sensory representations in S1 by functionally remapping responses in a subpopulation of neurons that was sensitive to reward history. Functional remapping crucially depended on top-down feedback as chemogenetic silencing of lateral OFC neurons disrupted reversal learning, as well as plasticity in S1. The dynamic interaction of lateral OFC with sensory cortex thus implements computations critical for value prediction that are history dependent and error based, providing plasticity essential for flexible decision-making. Dynamic interaction of neurons in lateral orbitofrontal cortex with the sensory cortex implements value-prediction computations that are history dependent and error based, providing plasticity essential for flexible decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W3083358975,"Accounting for heat burdens As climate warming becomes more and more apparent and influential, there is an increasing desire to predict its long-term impacts on species. Classically, this has been done by extrapolating lethal limits based on those observed in the laboratory. In the real world, however, organisms do not experience a single high temperature that then returns to a comfortable temperature, but rather a series of high temperatures during the hot season. Rezende et al. accounted for these accumulative effects in a dynamic model that accurately predicted empirical patterns in wild fruit fly populations, showing that cumulative effects of warming temperatures can be included in future estimates (see the Perspective by Huey and Kearney).

https://openalex.org/W3047077310,"Young stars are surrounded by a circumstellar disk of gas and dust, within which planet formation can occur. Gravitational forces in multiple star systems can disrupt the disk. Theoretical models predict that if the disk is misaligned with the orbital plane of the stars, the disk should warp and break into precessing rings, a phenomenon known as disk tearing. We present observations of the triple star system GWOrionis, finding evidence for disk tearing. Our images show an eccentric ring that is misaligned with the orbital planes and the outer disk. The ring casts shadows on a strongly warped intermediate region of the disk. If planets can form within the warped disk, disk tearing could provide a mechanism for forming wide-separation planets on oblique orbits."

https://openalex.org/W3082305772,"Terrestrial biogeochemistry of silicon Silicon is an important element in plant tissues and contributes to structural defenses against herbivores and other stresses. However, the terrestrial biogeochemical cycling of silicon is poorly understood, particularly the relative importance of geochemical and biological mechanisms in its regulation. de Tombeur et al. studied this question in 2-million-year chronosequences of soil and vegetation in Western Australia. Sites became progressively more weathered and infertile as they aged, indicating that the silicon cycle shifts from geochemical to biological control as the ecosystem develops (see the Perspective by Carey). They found that foliar silicon concentrations increase continuously during ecosystem development, even though rock-derived silicon is depleted in the older soils. By contrast, other major rock-derived nutrients showed decreasing concentrations in plants. Hence, biological silicon cycling allows plants to maintain concentrations even under conditions of extreme soil infertility. Science , this issue p. 1245 ; see also p. 1161"
https://openalex.org/W3083464634,"A new tool in the protein design toolbox Protein design can compute protein folds from first principles. However, designing new proteins that are functional remains challenging, in part because designing binding interactions requires simultaneous optimization of protein sequence and protein-ligand conformation. Polizzi and DeGrado designed proteins from scratch that bind a small-molecule drug (see the Perspective by Peacock). They introduced a new structural element called a van der Mer (vdM), which tracks the orientation of a chemical group relative to the backbone of a contacting residue. Assuming proteins bind ligands using interactions similar to intraprotein packing, they determined statistically preferred vdMs from a large set of structures in the Protein Data Bank. By including weighted vdMs in their computations, they designed two of six de novo proteins that bind the drug apixaban. A drug-protein x-ray crystal structure confirmed the designed model.

https://openalex.org/W3082244530,"As COVID-19 is rapidly unfolding in the United States, it is important to understand how individuals perceive the health and economic risks of the pandemic. In the absence of a readily available medical treatment, any strategy to contain the virus in the US will depend on the behavioral response of US residents. In this paper, we study individual's perceptions on COVID-19 and social distancing during the week of March 10-16, 2020, a week when COVID-19 was officially declared to be a pandemic by WHO and when new infections in the US were more than doubling every three days. Using a nationally representative sample of 5,414 respondents 18+ years of age from the Understanding America Study (UAS), we find that perceptions about COVID-19 health risks and economic consequences in the US population were largely pessimistic and highly variable by age and education. US residents who are young and do not have a college degree perceived a lower risk of getting infected but a higher probability of running out of money than others. Most individuals reported taking some steps to distance themselves from others but important differences emerge by gender and by source of information on COVID-19. Using state and day fixed-effect regressions, we show that perceptions of the health risks closely followed the number of COVID-19 cases in the country, and perceptions of the economic consequences and the prevalence of social distancing were driven upwards by both national and state-level cases. Unless addressed by effective health communication that reaches individuals across all social strata, variations in perceptions about COVID-19 epidemic raise concerns about the ability of the US to implement and sustain the widespread and restrictive policies that are required to curtail the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3082638357,"Background Recent data have suggested the presence of a reciprocal relationship between COVID-19 and kidney function. To date, most studies have focused on the effect of COVID-19 on kidney function, whereas data regarding kidney function on the COVID-19 prognosis is scarce. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between eGFR on admission and the mortality rate of COVID-19. Methods We recruited 336 adult consecutive patients (male: 57.1%, mean age: 55.0±16.0 years) that were hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a tertiary care university hospital. Data were collected from the electronic health records of the hospital. On admission, eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI formula. Acute kidney injury was defined according to the KDIGO criteria. Binary logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between eGFR on admission and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. Results Baseline eGFR was under 60 mL/min/1.73m2 in 61 patients (18.2%). Acute kidney injury occurred in 29.2% of the patients. In-hospital mortality rate was calculated as 12.8%. Age-adjusted and multivariate logistic regression analysis (p: 0.005, odds ratio: 0.974, CI: 0.956–0.992) showed that baseline eGFR was independently associated with mortality. Additionally, age-adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed a higher mortality rate in patients with an eGFR under 60 mL/min/1.73m2. Conclusions On admission eGFR seems to be a prognostic marker for mortality in patients with COVID-19. We recommend that eGFR be measured in all patients on admission and used as an additional tool for risk stratification. Close follow-up should be warranted in patients with a reduced eGFR."
https://openalex.org/W3083061165,"PET is a popular medical imaging modality for various clinical applications, including diagnosis and image-guided radiation therapy. The low-dose PET (LDPET) at a minimized radiation dosage is highly desirable in clinic since PET imaging involves ionizing radiation, and raises concerns about the risk of radiation exposure. However, the reduced dose of radioactive tracers could impact the image quality and clinical diagnosis. In this paper, a supervised deep learning approach with a generative adversarial network (GAN) and the cycle-consistency loss, Wasserstein distance loss, and an additional supervised learning loss, named as S-CycleGAN, is proposed to establish a non-linear end-to-end mapping model, and used to recover LDPET brain images. The proposed model, and two recently-published deep learning methods (RED-CNN and 3D-cGAN) were applied to 10% and 30% dose of 10 testing datasets, and a series of simulation datasets embedded lesions with different activities, sizes, and shapes. Besides vision comparisons, six measures including the NRMSE, SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, SUVmax and SUVmean were evaluated for 10 testing datasets and 45 simulated datasets. Our S-CycleGAN approach had comparable SSIM and PSNR, slightly higher noise but a better perception score and preserving image details, much better SUVmean and SUVmax, as compared to RED-CNN and 3D-cGAN. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations indicate the proposed approach is accurate, efficient and robust as compared to other state-of-the-art deep learning methods."
https://openalex.org/W3083125314,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has been shown to be produced acutely by skeletal muscle in response to exercise, yet chronically elevated with obesity and aging. The mechanisms by which IL-6 influences skeletal muscle mitochondria acutely and chronically are unclear. To better understand the influence of extramyocellular IL-6 on skeletal muscle mitochondrial physiology, we treated differentiated myotubes with exogenous IL-6 to evaluate the dose- and duration-dependent effects of IL-6 on salient aspects of mitochondrial biology and the role of canonical IL-6 signaling in muscle cells. Acute exposure of myotubes to IL-6 increased the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production and oxygen consumption rates (JO2 ) in a manner that was dependent on activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Furthermore, STAT3 activation by IL-6 was partly attenuated by MitoQ, a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, suggesting that mtROS potentiates STAT3 signaling in skeletal muscle in response to IL-6 exposure. In concert with effects on mitochondrial physiology, acute IL-6 exposure induced several mitochondrial adaptations, consistent with the stress-induced mitochondrial hyperfusion. Exposure of myotubes to chronically elevated IL-6 further increased mtROS with eventual loss of respiratory capacity. These data provide new evidence supporting the interplay between cytokine signaling and mitochondrial physiology in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3081655999,"Widespread testing for the presence of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals remains vital for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic prior to the advent of an effective treatment. Challenges in testing can be traced to an initial shortage of supplies, expertise, and/or instrumentation necessary to detect the virus by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR), the most robust, sensitive, and specific assay currently available. Here we show that academic biochemistry and molecular biology laboratories equipped with appropriate expertise and infrastructure can replicate commercially available SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test kits and backfill pipeline shortages. The Georgia Tech COVID-19 Test Kit Support Group, composed of faculty, staff, and trainees across the biotechnology quad at Georgia Institute of Technology, synthesized multiplexed primers and probes and formulated a master mix composed of enzymes and proteins produced in-house. Our in-house kit compares favorably with a commercial product used for diagnostic testing. We also developed an environmental testing protocol to readily monitor surfaces for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Our blueprint should be readily reproducible by research teams at other institutions, and our protocols may be modified and adapted to enable SARS-CoV-2 detection in more resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W3040396243,"Transient modulation of the genes involved in immunity, without exerting a permanent change in the DNA code, can be an effective strategy to modulate the course of many inflammatory conditions. CRISPR-Cas9 technology represents a promising platform for achieving this goal. Truncation of guide RNA (gRNA) from the 5′ end enables the application of a nuclease competent Cas9 protein for transcriptional modulation of genes, allowing multifunctionality of CRISPR. Here, we introduce an enhanced CRISPR-based transcriptional repressor to reprogram immune homeostasis in vivo. In this repressor system, two transcriptional repressors—heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1a) and Krüppel-associated box (KRAB)—are fused to the MS2 coat protein and subsequently recruited by gRNA aptamer binding to a nuclease competent CRISPR complex containing truncated gRNAs. With the enhanced repressor, we demonstrate transcriptional repression of the Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (Myd88) gene in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that this strategy can efficiently downregulate Myd88 expression in lung, blood and bone marrow of Cas9 transgenic mice that receive systemic injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)2/1-carrying truncated gRNAs targeting Myd88 and the MS2-HP1a-KRAB cassette. This downregulation is accompanied by changes in downstream signalling elements such as TNF-α and ICAM-1. Myd88 repression leads to a decrease in immunoglobulin G (IgG) production against AAV2/1 and AAV2/9 and this strategy modulates the IgG response against AAV cargos. It improves the efficiency of a subsequent AAV9/CRISPR treatment for repression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a gene that, when repressed, can lower blood cholesterol levels. We also demonstrate that CRISPR-mediated Myd88 repression can act as a prophylactic measure against septicaemia in both Cas9 transgenic and C57BL/6J mice. When delivered by nanoparticles, this repressor can serve as a therapeutic modality to influence the course of septicaemia. Collectively, we report that CRISPR-mediated repression of endogenous Myd88 can effectively modulate the host immune response against AAV-mediated gene therapy and influence the course of septicaemia. The ability to control Myd88 transcript levels using a CRISPR-based synthetic repressor can be an effective strategy for AAV-based CRISPR therapies, as this pathway serves as a key node in the induction of humoral immunity against AAV serotypes. Moghadam et al. developed a CRISPR transcriptional repressor to silence MyD88 expression in vivo to modulate immune response against AAV gene therapy and septicaemia."
https://openalex.org/W3083072708,"Vibrio cholerae is a natural inhabitant of aquatic ecosystems worldwide, typically residing in coastal or brackish water. While more than 200 serogroups have been identified, only serogroups O1 and O139 have been associated with epidemic cholera. However, infections other than cholera can be caused by nonepidemic, non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strains, including gastroenteritis and extraintestinal infections. While V. cholerae can also survive in freshwater, that is typically only observed in regions of the world where cholera is endemic. We recently isolated V. cholerae from several locations in lakes and rivers in northwest Ohio. These isolates were all found to be non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strains, that would not cause cholera. However, these isolates contained a variety of virulence genes, including ctxA, rtxA, rtxC, hlyA, and ompU. Therefore, it is possible that some of these isolates have the potential to cause gastroenteritis or other infections in humans. We also investigated the relative motility of the isolates and their ability to form biofilms as this is important for V. cholerae survival in the environment. We identified one isolate that forms very robust biofilms, up to 4x that of our laboratory strains. Finally, we investigated the susceptibility of these isolates to a panel of antibiotics. We found that many of the isolates showed decreased susceptibility to some of the antibiotics tested, which could be of concern. While we do not know if these isolates are pathogenic to humans, increased surveillance to better understand the public health risk to the local community should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W3083036202,"Background Eculizumab has transformed management of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) since its approval. However, its biweekly dosing regimen remains a high treatment burden. Ravulizumab administered every 8 weeks demonstrated noninferiority to eculizumab in two phase 3 trials. In regions where two PNH treatment options are available, it is important to consider patient preference. Objective The aim of this study was to assess patient preference for ravulizumab or eculizumab. Methods Study 302s (ALXN1210-PNH-302s) enrolled PNH patients who participated in the extension period of phase 3 study ALXN1210-PNH-302. In the parent study, eculizumab-experienced adult PNH patients received ravulizumab or eculizumab during a 26-week primary evaluation period. All patients in the extension period received ravulizumab. In study 302s, patient treatment preference was evaluated using an 11-item PNH-specific Patient Preference Questionnaire (PNH-PPQ©). Of 98 patients, 95 completed PNH-PPQ© per protocol for analysis. Results Overall, 93% of patients preferred ravulizumab whereas 7% of patients either had no preference (6%) or preferred eculizumab (1%) (P < 0.001). For specific aspects of treatment, ravulizumab was preferred (in comparison to no preference or eculizumab) on infusion frequency (98% vs. 0% vs. 2%), ability to plan activities (98% vs. 0% vs. 2%), and overall quality of life (88% vs. 11% vs. 1%), among other aspects. Most participants selected frequency of infusions as the most important factor determining preference (43%), followed by overall quality of life (23%). Conclusion This study shows that a substantial proportion of patients preferred ravulizumab over eculizumab and provides an important patient perspective on PNH treatment when there is more than one treatment option."

https://openalex.org/W3083427605,"Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport proteins (ESCRT) catalyze the fission of cellular membranes during budding of membrane away from the cytosol. Here we have used Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to visualize the recruitment of ESCRTs specifically, ALIX, CHMP4b and VPS4 onto the budding HIV Gag virus-like particles (VLPs). We imaged the budding VLPs with 200 millisecond time resolution for 300 frames. Our data shows three phases for ESCRT dynamics: 1) recruitment in which subunits of ALIX, CHMP4b and VPS4 are recruited with constant proportions on the budding sites of HIV Gag virus like particles for nearly 10 seconds, followed by 2) disassembly of ALIX and CHMP4b while VPS4 signal remains constant for nearly 20 seconds followed by 3) disassembly of VPS4. We hypothesized that the disassembly observed in step 2 was catalyzed by VPS4 and powered by ATP hydrolysis. To test this hypothesis, we performed ATP depletion using (-) glucose medium, deoxyglucose and oligomycin. Imaging ATP depleted cells, we show that the disassembly of CHMP4b and ALIX observed in step 2 is ATP dependent. ATP depletion resulted in the recruitment of approximately 2-fold as many subunits of all ESCRTs. Resuming ATP production in cells, resulted in disassembly of the full ESCRT machinery which had been locked in place during ATP depletion. With some caveats, our experiments provide insight into the formation of the ESCRT machinery at the budding site of HIV during budding."

The biology of TNBC in HL women has been poorly characterized, but some data suggest that the molecular drivers of breast cancer might differ. There are no clinical tools to aid medical oncologists with decisions regarding appropriate individualized therapy, and no way to predict long-term outcomes. The aim of this study was to characterize individual patient gene mutation profiles and to identify the relationship with clinical outcomes. We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors (FFPE) from women with TNBC. We analyzed the gene mutation profiles of the collected tumors and compared the results with individual patient’s clinical histories and outcomes. Of 25 patients with TNBC, 24 (96%) identified as HL. Twenty-one (84%) had stage III–IV disease. The most commonly mutated genes were TP53, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, AKT, MEP3K, PIK3CA, and EGFR. Compared with other international cancer databases, our study demonstrated statistically significant higher frequencies of these genes among HL women. Additionally, a worse clinical course was observed among patients whose tumors had mutations in NOTCH genes and PIK3CA. This study is the first to identify the most common genetic alterations among HL women with TNBC. Our data strongly support the notion that molecular drivers of breast cancer could differ in HL women compared with other ethnic backgrounds. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms behind NOTCH gene and PIK3CA mutations may lead to a new treatment approach."
https://openalex.org/W3083564694,"Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common subtype of renal cancer, has a poor clinical outcome. A hallmark of ccRCC is genetic loss-of-function of VHL (von Hippel-Lindau) that leads to a highly vascularized tumor microenvironment. Although many ccRCC patients initially respond to antiangiogenic therapies, virtually all develop progressive, drug-refractory disease. Given the role of dysregulated expressions of cytoskeletal and cytoskeleton-regulatory proteins in tumor progression, we performed analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptome data for different classes of actin-binding proteins to demonstrate that increased mRNA expression of profilin1 (Pfn1), Arp3, cofilin1, Ena/VASP, and CapZ, is an indicator of poor prognosis in ccRCC. Focusing further on Pfn1, we performed immunohistochemistry-based classification of Pfn1 staining in tissue microarrays, which indicated Pfn1 positivity in both tumor and stromal cells; however, the vast majority of ccRCC tumors tend to be Pfn1-positive selectively in stromal cells only. This finding is further supported by evidence for dramatic transcriptional up-regulation of Pfn1 in tumor-associated vascular endothelial cells in the clinical specimens of ccRCC. In vitro studies support the importance of Pfn1 in proliferation and migration of RCC cells and in soluble Pfn1's involvement in vascular endothelial cell tumor cell cross-talk. Furthermore, proof-of-concept studies demonstrate that treatment with a novel computationally designed Pfn1-actin interaction inhibitor identified herein reduces proliferation and migration of RCC cells in vitro and RCC tumor growth in vivo Based on these findings, we propose a potentiating role for Pfn1 in promoting tumor cell aggressiveness in the setting of ccRCC."

https://openalex.org/W3082258754,"Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a central enzyme for the synthesis of DNA building blocks. Most aerobic organisms, including nearly all eukaryotes, have class I RNRs consisting of R1 and R2 subunits. The catalytic R1 subunit contains an overall activity site that can allosterically turn the enzyme on or off by the binding of ATP or dATP, respectively. The mechanism behind the ability to turn the enzyme off via the R1 subunit involves the formation of different types of R1 oligomers in most studied species and R1–R2 octamers in Escherichia coli. To better understand the distribution of different oligomerization mechanisms, we characterized the enzyme from Clostridium botulinum, which belongs to a subclass of class I RNRs not studied before. The recombinantly expressed enzyme was analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography, gas-phase electrophoretic mobility macromolecular analysis, EM, X-ray crystallography, and enzyme assays. Interestingly, it shares the ability of the E. coli RNR to form inhibited R1–R2 octamers in the presence of dATP but, unlike the E. coli enzyme, cannot be turned off by combinations of ATP and dGTP/dTTP. A phylogenetic analysis of class I RNRs suggests that activity regulation is not ancestral but was gained after the first subclasses diverged and that RNR subclasses with inhibition mechanisms involving R1 oligomerization belong to a clade separated from the two subclasses forming R1–R2 octamers. These results give further insight into activity regulation in class I RNRs as an evolutionarily dynamic process."

The objective of this study was to estimate the burden of dengue fever and to assess its effects on pregnancy outcomes in hospitalized pregnant women during the 2017 outbreak in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Method This was a retrospective cohort study including febrile pregnant women from five health facilities in Ouagadougou. The study was carried out from July 1st to December 31st, 2017. A logistic stepwise regression was performed to identify the pregnancy adverse outcomes risk factors. Results Our study included 424 pregnant women at a mean age of 27.1 years old (Standard deviation: 6.23 years). Overall 28.54% (121/424) were infected with dengue virus. During follow-up, 29.01% (123/424) presented an adverse pregnancy outcome. Adjusted for gestational age and clinical symptoms, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome was twice as high among dengue infected women as compared to uninfected women with an adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 2.09 (1.08–4.05). The risk of the adverse pregnancy outcome was higher in the third trimester of pregnancy with aOR = 1.66 (1.02–2.72) in dengue fever infected women. Conclusion Dengue fever is a risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially in the third trimester in Burkina Faso. The implementation of effective anti-vectorial control interventions and better management of dengue fever during pregnancy are needed to improve pregnancy outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W3083473332,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein complex (EMC) is a conserved protein complex involved in inserting the transmembrane domain of membrane proteins into membranes in the ER. EMC3 is an essential component of EMC and is important for rhodopsin synthesis in photoreceptor cells. However, the in vivo function of Emc3 in bipolar cells (BCs) has not been determined. To explore the role of Emc3 in BCs, we generated a BC-specific Emc3 knockout mouse model (named Emc3 cKO) using the Purkinje cell protein 2 (Pcp2) Cre line. Although normal electroretinography (ERG) b-waves were observed in Emc3 cKO mice at 6 months of age, Emc3 cKO mice exhibited reduced b-wave amplitudes at 12 months of age, as determined by scotopic and photopic ERG, and progressive death of BCs, whereas the ERG a-wave amplitudes were preserved. PKCa staining of retinal cryosections from Emc3 cKO mice revealed death of rod BCs. Loss of Emc3 led to the presence of the synaptic protein mGLuR6 in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Immunostaining analysis of presynaptic protein postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) revealed rod terminals retracted to the ONL in Emc3 cKO mice at 12 months of age. In addition, deletion of Emc3 resulted in elevated glial fibrillary acidic protein, indicating reactive gliosis in the retina. Our data demonstrate that loss of Emc3 in BCs leads to decreased ERG response, increased astrogliosis and disruption of the retinal inner nuclear layer in mice of 12 months of age. Taken together, our studies indicate that Emc3 is not required for the development of BCs but is important for long-term survival of BCs."
https://openalex.org/W3083293289,"Hearing aids are an effective treatment for individuals with hearing loss that have been shown to dampen (and sometime ameliorate) the negative effects of hearing loss. Despite the devices' efficacy, many reject hearing aids as a form of treatment. In the present qualitative study, we explored the reasons for hearing aid non-use in the United States that emerged from the stories of adults with hearing loss who do not to utilize hearing aids. We specifically used thematic analysis in concert with an attribution theory framework to identify and analyze recurring themes and reasons throughout these individuals' narratives. A total of nine themes describing reasons of hearing aid non-use emerged. Four reasons were internally motivated: (1) non-necessity, (2) stigmatization, (3) lack of integration into daily living, and (4) unreadiness due to lack of education; five reasons were externally motivated: (5) discomfort, (6) financial setback, (7) burden, (8) professional distrust, and (9) priority setting. These findings contribute to the field of hearing healthcare by providing professionals with insight into reasons that people across the provided when recounting their experiences following the diagnosis of hearing loss, prescription for hearing aids, and their hearing aid non-use. These findings are an important step toward the development of more effective, person-centered hearing healthcare that can best address these individuals' concerns and expectations surrounding hearing loss and hearing aids."
https://openalex.org/W3083248944,"The births of domestic dogs with pigment deletion and associated congenital hearing and/or vision impairments are increasing, as a result of mutations of certain genes expressing popular coat colour patterns (Merle, piebald, Irish spotting). The future of these dogs is often pessimistic (early euthanasia or placement in rescues/fosters, lack of interactions and activities for adults). These pessimistic scenarios result from popular assumptions predicting that dogs with congenital hearing/vision impairments exhibit severe Merle-related health troubles (cardiac, skeletal, neurological), impairment-related behavioural troubles (aggressiveness, anxiety), and poor capacities to communicate, to be trained, and to be engaged in leisure or work activities. However, there is no direct scientific testing, and hence no evidence or refutation, of these assumptions. We therefore addressed an online questionnaire to owners of 223 congenitally sensory impaired (23 vision impaired, 63 hearing impaired, 137 hearing and vision impaired) and 217 sensory normal dogs from various countries. The sensory normal cohort was matched in age, lifetime with owner, breed and sex with the sensory impaired cohort, and was used as a baseline. The questionnaire assessed demographics, morphology, sensory impairments, health and behavioural troubles, activities, and dog-owner communication. Most hearing and/or vision impaired dogs exhibited abnormal pigment deletion in their coat and irises. Vision impaired dogs additionally exhibited ophthalmic abnormalities typically related to Merle. The results are opposed to all above-listed assumptions, except for neurological troubles, which were more frequently reported in sensory impaired dogs. However, we suggest that this finding could be partially accounted for by a lack of diagnosis of breed-related drug sensitivity and impairment-related compulsive behaviours. Results about communication and activities are particularly optimistic. The need for future studies of numerous dogs from various breeds tested for Merle, piebald and medical-drug-resistance genes, and the beneficial effects that present and future research may have on the future of sensory impaired dogs, are discussed."

This study aimed to investigate HRQoL using both generic and haemophilia-specific QoL instruments and to assess the clinical factors associated with HRQoL among haemophilia patients in Korea. In this cross-sectional, multicenter, observational study, moderate-to-severe haemophilia patients aged 8-64 years were recruited between November 2012 and September 2013. The EQ-5D Questionnaire, EQ Visual Analogue Scale, and Haemophilia-Specific QoL (Haemo-QoL) Questionnaire (Haemo-QoL for 8-16 years and Haemo-A-QoL for ≥17 years) were used to assess HRQoL. A total of 605 participants with a mean age of 29.32 ± 12.62 years were enrolled. The mean Haemo-QoL scores revealed significant differences by age group (children vs. adolescent vs. adult, 26.44 ± 11.3 vs. 28.88 ± 11.1 vs. 38.43 ± 17.7, respectively, p < 0.001). ""Sports and leisure,"" ""family planning,"" and ""view"" in adults and ""perceived support,"" ""friends,"" and ""dealing"" in children and adolescents were identified as the domains with the greatest HRQoL impairments. HRQoL was significantly impaired in patients with the following clinical factors: hepatitis, haemophilia-induced disability, bleeding experiences within the last 6 months, joint bleedings within the last 6 months, and haemophilic arthropathy. According to the multivariate regression analysis, HRQoL showed a negative association with the presence of haemophilia-induced disability (β = 0.222, p < 0.0001), bleeding experiences within the last 6 months (β = 0.098, p = 0.010), and haemophilic arthropathy (β = 0.212, p < 0.0001). HRQoL decreased in patients with older age and impaired clinical conditions among moderate-to-severe haemophilia patients in Korea. These study findings may provide significant insights into the adequate haemophilia management using patient-reported measurements."
https://openalex.org/W3083028985,"In cancer treatment an attempt has been made to pharmacologically regulate the proteasome functions, thus the aim was to test whether 20S proteasome chymotrypsin-like (ChT-L) activity has a role in glial brain tumors. Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between proteasome activity and IL-8, CCL2, NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 concentrations, which impact on brain tumors has already been indicated.Plasma 20S proteasome ChT-L activity was assayed using the fluorogenic peptide substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC in the presence of SDS. IL-8, CCL2, NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 concentration was analyzed with the use of ELISA method. Immunohistochemistry for IDH1-R132H was done on 5-microns-thick formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor sections with the use of antibody specific for the mutant IDH1-R132H protein. Labelled streptavidin biotin kit was used as a detection system.Brain tumor patients had statistically higher 20S proteasome ChT-L activity (0.649 U/mg) compared to non-tumoral individuals (0.430 U/mg). IDH1 wild-type patients had statistically higher 20S proteasome ChT-L activity (1.025 U/mg) compared to IDH1 mutants (0.549 U/mg). 20S proteasome ChT-L activity in brain tumor patients who died as the consequence of a tumor (0.649) in the following 2 years was statistically higher compared to brain tumor patients who lived (0.430 U/mg). In brain tumor patients the 20S proteasome ChT-L activity positively correlated with IL-8 concentration.Elevated 20S proteasome ChT-L activity was related to the increased risk of death in glial brain tumor patients. A positive correlation between 20S proteasome ChT-L activity and IL-8 concentration may indicate the molecular mechanisms regulating glial tumor biology. Thus research on proteasomes may be important and should be carried out to verify if this protein complexes may represent a potential therapeutic target to limit brain tumor invasion."
https://openalex.org/W3083640067,"This paper analyzes the impact of air transport connectivity and accessibility on scientific collaboration. Numerous studies demonstrated that the likelihood of collaboration declines with increase in distance between potential collaborators. These works commonly use simple measures of physical distance rather than actual flight capacity and frequency. Our study addresses this limitation by focusing on the relationship between flight availability and the number of scientific co-publications. Furthermore, we distinguish two components of flight availability: (1) direct and indirect air connections between airports; and (2) distance to the nearest airport from cities and towns where authors of scientific articles have their professional affiliations. Based on Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression, we provide evidence that greater flight availability is associated with more frequent scientific collaboration. More flight connections (connectivity) and proximity of airport (accessibility) increase the expected number of coauthored scientific papers. Moreover, direct flights and flights with one transfer are more valuable for intensifying scientific cooperation than travels involving more connecting flights. Further, analysis of four organizational sub-datasets—Arizona State University, Indiana University Bloomington, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, and University of Michigan—shows that the relationship between airline transport availability and scientific collaboration is not uniform, but is associated with the research profile of an institution and the characteristics of the airport that serves this institution."

Factors associated with ""false positive aneurysms on MRA"" (FPAMs),"" which are finally confirmed as negative on DSA, have rarely been reported. This study aimed to identify the clinical or radiologic clues indicative of FPAM on DSA.Patients who had undergone DSA between 2016 and 2019 for suspicious aneurysm-like structures < 5 mm in size on MRA were enrolled. Patient demographics and the details regarding the geometry of the structures were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the associated factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess the clinical implications.Of the 107 suspicious structures, 46 were indicated as being false positive on DSA (42.96%). Location (positive on C7 and negative on C5-6 ICA) and lower dome to neck ratio were found to be significant parameters in the multivariate analysis. The dome to neck ratio threshold value was 0.99.Suspicious aneurysm-like structures located not on C5-6 but on C7 ICA and having wide neck morphologies (dome to neck ratio < 0.99) are highly likely to be negative on DSA."
https://openalex.org/W3083012698,"Using multilevel logistic regression to analyse management data of reablement episodes collected by Essex County Council, a UK local authority, this article identifies constraining and enabling factors for successful reablement. Overall, 59.5% of reablement clients were classed as able to care for themselves when assessed after 13 weeks following the reablement intervention (N = 8,118). Several age-related, disability, referral, and social factors were found to constrain reablement, but some of the largest constraining effects were neighbourhood deprivation as measured through the Index of Multiple Deprivation and, particularly, unfavourable geodemographic profiles as measured through Experian Mosaic consumer classifications. The results suggest that in order to optimise reablement, programmes should consider broader social and environmental influences on reablement rather than only individual and organisational aspects. Reablement might also be better tailored and intensified for client groups with particular underlying disabilities and for those displaying specific geodemographic characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W3083714811,"Health care decision makers require capacity to demand and use research evidence for effective decision making. Capacity to undertake health policy and systems research (HPSR) and teaching is low in developing countries. Strengthening the capacity of producers and users of research is a more sustainable strategy for developing the field of HPSR in Africa, than relying on training in high-income countries.Data were collected from 118 participants who had received the capacity building, using a pre-tested questionnaire. Respondents included health research scientists from institutions (producers) and decision makers (users) in the public health sector, in Anambra and Enugu states, southeast Nigeria. Data were collected on participants' progress with proposed group activities in their short- term goals; effects of these activities on evidence-informed decision making and constraints to implementing activities. Univariate analysis was done using SPSS version 16.All prioritised activities were carried out. However, responses were low. Highest response for an activity amongst producers was 39.1%, and 44.4% for users. Some of the activities implemented positively influenced changes in practice; like modification of existing policies and programme plans. There was a wide range of responses between producers of evidence (0.0-39.1%) and users (2.7-44.4%) across both study states. Lack of authority to implement activities was the major constraint (42-9-100.0% across activities), followed by financial constraints (70.6%).Capacity building intervention improved skills of a critical mass of research scientists, policymakers and practitioners, towards evidence-based decision making. Participants committed to undertake proposed activities but faced a number of constraints. These need to be addressed, especially the decision space and authority, improving funding to implement activities that influence Getting Research into Policy & Practice (GRIPP).

https://openalex.org/W3083244961,"Attachment instruments vary substantially in practicability of administration, employment of categorical versus dimensional scoring, quality of scales, and applicability to different attachment figures. The Attachment Network Q-sort (ANQ) is a self-report, quasi-qualitative instrument that discriminates relationship-specific attachment styles for multiple attachment figures. The current study assesses the properties of the ANQ in psychotherapy patients and in non-patient respondents, using mother, father and romantic partner as possible attachment figures. Analyzing the ANQ-data with latent class analysis, we found four types or classes of participants: a group with an overall secure profile, a group only insecure for father, a group only insecure for mother, and a group insecure for mother as well as father but not for partner (if available). These profiles proved to have good concurrent, discriminant and construct validity. We conclude that the ANQ is potentially a useful alternative clinical self-report instrument to assess combinations of attachment styles for a range of attachment figures such as parents and a romantic partner."
https://openalex.org/W3083478734,"A summary indicator for evaluating the breast cancer network has never been measured at the regional level. The aim is to design treemaps providing a summary description of hospitals (including breast units) and Local Health Units (LHUs) in terms of their levels of performance within the breast cancer network of the Lazio region (central Italy). The treemap structure has an intuitive design and displays information from both general and specific analyses.Patients admitted to the regional hospitals for malignant breast cancer (MBC) surgery in 2010-2017 were selected in a population-based cohort study. These quality indicators were calculated based on the international guidelines (EUSOMA, ESMO) to assess the performance in terms of volume of activity, surgery procedure, post-surgery assistance and timeliness of medical therapy or radiotherapy beginning. The quality indicators were calculated using administrative health data systematically collected at the regional level and were included in the treemap to represent the surgery or the post-surgery areas of the breast cancer clinical pathway. In order to allow aggregation of scores for different indicators belonging to the same clinical area, up to five evaluation classes were defined using the ""Jenks Natural Breaks"" algorithm. A score and a colour were assigned to each clinical area based on the ranking of the indicators involved. The analyses were performed on an annual basis, by the LHU of residence and by the hospital which performed the surgical intervention.In 2017, 6218 surgical interventions for MBC were performed in the hospitals of Lazio. The results showed a continuous increase of the level of performance over the years. Hospitals showed higher variability in the levels of performance than the LHUs. 36% of the evaluated hospitals reached a high level of performance. An audit of the S. Filippo Neri breast unit revealed incorrect coding of the input data. For this reason, the score for the indicator for the volume of wards was re-calculated and re-evaluated, with a subsequent improvement of the level of performance. Most LHUs achieved at least an average overall level of performance, with 20% of the LHUs reaching a high level of performance.This is the first attempt to apply the treemap logic to a single clinical network, in order to obtain a summary indicator for the evaluation of the breast cancer care network. Our results supply decision makers with a transparent instrument of governance for heterogeneous users, directing efforts improving and promoting equity of care. The treemaps could be reproduced and adapted for other local contexts, in order to limit inappropriateness and ensure uniform levels of breast cancer care within local areas. The next step is the evaluation of audit and feedback interventions to improve the quality of care and to guarantee homogeneous levels of care throughout the region."

We assess whether prior insurance instability is associated with changes in use of emergency and office-based care after the Marketplace and Medicaid expansion were introduced.Our study draws from the 2013-14 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, identifying a cohort of non-elderly adults with full-year health insurance coverage in 2014. We use linear and multinomial logistic regression to assess the relationship between insurance instability prior to 2014 (uninsured for 1-11 months, ≥12 months) and person-level changes in use of health care after gaining coverage (change in ED and office visits from 2013 to 2014) with continuously insured individuals serving as a comparison group.Being uninsured for at least one year prior to gaining full-year coverage in 2014 was associated with a 33% increase in ED visits (0.06 visits, p<0.01) and a 47% increase in office visits (1.10 visits, p<0.01), driven by those gaining public coverage. We found no evidence of substitution across settings in the short term, often a stated goal of expansion.The long-term uninsured may have substantial health needs and pent-up demand for health care, seeing more physicians across multiple settings in the year after gaining coverage as they seek to get unmanaged conditions under control. Closing the gap in primary care use between the previously uninsured and those with health insurance coverage may help improve long-term health outcomes."

CAs and NMs responded to questionnaires through a computer-driven interface with Audio Computer-Assisted Self Interview (ACASI) software. Although NMs scored higher on socio-economic status, self-esteem and general self-efficacy, they had lower HIV knowledge (AOR 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.1), greater inconsistent condom use (AOR 3.2; 95% CI: 2.4-4.9), and recent experience as perpetrators of physical (AOR 2.5; 95% CI: 1.2-5.1) or sexual (AOR 4.1; 95% CI: 1.4-12.7) intimate partner violence; and as victims of physical (AOR 1.5; 95% CI: 1.0-2.3) or sexual (AOR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3-3.8) forms of violence than CAs. Higher HIV knowledge and lower sexual risk behaviors among CAs suggest PLH's potential as communicators of HIV prevention information to NMs. CAs' training should also focus on improving self-esteem, general self-efficacy and social support to increase their potential effectiveness as HIV prevention educators and enhance their own overall health and well-being."
https://openalex.org/W3082123533,"I hurried downstairs to the cafeteria. At the table sat my new mentees: six eager undergraduates who had signed on to work on an 8-month aquatic toxicology project I had devised. It was a crucial piece of my Ph.D. research, and it would satisfy a key graduation requirement for the undergrads. “Starting today, I get to learn what it's like to be my Ph.D. adviser,” I thought to myself excitedly. But a few minutes into the meeting, the students broke the news: They didn't have any training in toxicology. My chest tightened. How would this ever work?



> “Letting the students find their own way gave them room to grow as scientists.” 

My inspiration to engage undergraduates in my research had come after 2 years of working as a teaching assistant. Many of my undergraduate students had voiced the same frustrations I once had: They were expected to absorb facts and regurgitate them in exams, rinse and repeat, without any real critical thinking or opportunity to apply what they had learned. I could fill that gap, I believed, by creating a project related to my own work and enlisting undergrads as the researchers, guiding them through the process while empowering them to take the lead.

My thesis adviser was supportive, knowing it would be good experience for a principal investigator (PI) hopeful like me. My department purchased the fish we would study, and a government research lab offered space for the experiments. Everything was in place—except for the students' toxicology training.

I was worried. But 150 yearling rainbow trout were waiting to be picked up from the hatchery. Backing out was not an option.

I reminded myself how green I had been when I was an undergrad just starting to work with a Ph.D. student. My first day in the lab, I was tasked with exposing plants to precise doses of chemicals and measuring their responses—experiments unlike any I'd done before. Despite my lack of experience, my mentor gave me a key to the plant growth chambers and walked me through how to set up and run the experiment. Then, he left me to it. He assured me that he was available to help, but he did not hover over my shoulder.

I spent hours meticulously setting up the experiment—and realized 3 hours later, after checking my lab notebook, that I had dosed the plants with the wrong concentrations of chemicals. I had to throw everything out and start over. But my mentor was patient. He let me make these mistakes so I could learn from them and find my own way as a researcher.

Now his example inspired me. On the students' first day in the lab, I walked them through the facilities and trained them on the protocols they would be using. Then, I let them be and stood by, ready to help. In the first few days, I noticed that some forgot to calibrate the instruments or didn't follow my instructions for dissecting the fish. My instinct was to jump in and save the day. But instead, I refrained from intervening and watched proudly as the students identified their mistakes and learned from them.

Later, I put them in the driver's seat when writing up the results for publication. The students surprised me by taking the paper in a different direction than we had discussed. Again, I trusted them, and they prepared an excellent manuscript.

When we reconvened in the cafeteria for a reflection meeting 6 months into the project, the students thanked me for not micromanaging them, even though it had been scary for them at first. Letting the students find their own way gave them room to grow as scientists. And in the process, I also grew as a mentor.

Good mentorship means trusting your mentees' capacity and treating them as more than instruments to collect data. I hope that someday I'm able to put this approach to use as a PI running my own lab. But it can be employed at any level. Good mentorship is good mentorship, whether you're a grad student or a PI—and, when given the chance, mentees can handle the responsibility."

In this special issue, we critically examine the state of democracy and how it must adapt to achieve its ideals in the 21st century. We need to meet the challenges and opportunities of living in increasingly multiethnic societies, of fostering democracy in a weakened international environment, of reducing inequality and elevating the political representation of the poor, and of organizing social movements and combating disinformation tactics in the digital age. Advances in technology are making it easier to distort true voter representation through gerrymandering, and political campaigns continue to struggle with reaching voters and persuading them to participate. Worryingly, state violence, which has always been a core feature of the democratic experience for some, is spreading in democratic societies.

Twenty years ago, it seemed inevitable that democracy would reach every corner of the globe. In this moment, we are reminded that we must fight for democracy and work to improve it. A scientific understanding of the social and behavioral phenomena that underlie its operation will help us enhance democracy and, by doing so, improve human lives and societies globally."
https://openalex.org/W3083489173,"Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) are challenging to detect as a result of the species cryptic behavior and coloration, relatively low densities in complex habitats, and affinity for cold, high clarity, low conductivity waters. Bull trout are also closely associated with the stream bed, frequently conceal in substrate, and this concealment behavior is poorly understood. Consequently, population assessments are problematic and biologists and managers often lack quantitative information to accurately describe bull trout distributions, estimate abundance, and assess status and trends; particularly for stream-dwelling populations. During controlled laboratory trials, we recorded concealment, resting, and swimming behavior of juvenile wild bull trout in response to: (1) constant and fluctuating water temperature, (2) presence or absence of light, and (3) substrate size. Light level had the strongest influence on wild fish concealment and more fish concealed as light levels increased from darkness to daylight. Wild fish were 14.5 times less likely to conceal in constant darkness and 4.1 times more likely to conceal in 12 h light x 12 h darkness compared to constant light. Wild fish were 6.2 times less likely to conceal in small (26-51 mm) substrate compared to larger (52-102 mm) substrate. As water temperature increased, fewer wild fish concealed. Knowledge of wild bull trout concealment will improve field sampling protocols and increase detection efficiencies. These data also enhance knowledge of bull trout niche requirements which illuminates ecological differences among species and informs conservation and restoration efforts."
