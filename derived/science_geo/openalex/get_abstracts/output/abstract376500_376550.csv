https://openalex.org/W2112409097,"We performed a second-generation genome-wide association study of 4,533 individuals with celiac disease (cases) and 10,750 control subjects. We genotyped 113 selected SNPs with P(GWAS) < 10(-4) and 18 SNPs from 14 known loci in a further 4,918 cases and 5,684 controls. Variants from 13 new regions reached genome-wide significance (P(combined) < 5 x 10(-8)); most contain genes with immune functions (BACH2, CCR4, CD80, CIITA-SOCS1-CLEC16A, ICOSLG and ZMIZ1), with ETS1, RUNX3, THEMIS and TNFRSF14 having key roles in thymic T-cell selection. There was evidence to suggest associations for a further 13 regions. In an expression quantitative trait meta-analysis of 1,469 whole blood samples, 20 of 38 (52.6%) tested loci had celiac risk variants correlated (P < 0.0028, FDR 5%) with cis gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1966537571,"Hyperexcitability of spinal reflexes and reduced synaptic inhibition are commonly associated with spasticity after spinal cord injury (SCI). In adults, the activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABAA) and glycine receptors inhibits neurons as a result of low intracellular chloride (Cl-) concentration, which is maintained by the potassium-chloride cotransporter KCC2 (encoded by Slc12a5). We show that KCC2 is downregulated after SCI in rats, particularly in motoneuron membranes, thereby depolarizing the Cl- equilibrium potential and reducing the strength of postsynaptic inhibition. Blocking KCC2 in intact rats reduces the rate-dependent depression (RDD) of the Hoffmann reflex, as is observed in spasticity. RDD is also decreased in KCC2-deficient mice and in intact rats after intrathecal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) injection, which downregulates KCC2. The early decrease in KCC2 after SCI is prevented by sequestering BDNF at the time of SCI. Conversely, after SCI, BDNF upregulates KCC2 and restores RDD. Our results open new perspectives for the development of therapeutic strategies to alleviate spasticity."

https://openalex.org/W1965240438,"Kynurenine, a metabolite produced by the action of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase on tryptophan, accumulates under inflammatory conditions and has immunomodulatory effects. This study by Yutang Wang et al. describes a new function for kynurenine as an endogenous vasodilator under conditions of systemic inflammation, such as malaria infection and endotoxemia in mice, and provides insight into the molecular mechanisms involved ( pages 265–267 ). Control of blood vessel tone is central to vascular homeostasis. Here we show that metabolism of tryptophan to kynurenine by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (Ido) expressed in endothelial cells contributes to arterial vessel relaxation and the control of blood pressure. Infection of mice with malarial parasites (Plasmodium berghei) or induction of endotoxemia in mice led to endothelial expression of Ido, decreased plasma tryptophan concentration, increased kynurenine concentration and hypotension. Pharmacological inhibition of Ido increased blood pressure in systemically inflamed mice but not in mice deficient in Ido or interferon-γ, which is required for Ido induction. Both tryptophan and kynurenine dilated preconstricted porcine coronary arteries; the dilating effect of tryptophan required the presence of active Ido and an intact endothelium, whereas the effect of kynurenine was endothelium independent. The arterial relaxation induced by kynurenine was mediated by activation of the adenylate and soluble guanylate cyclase pathways. Kynurenine administration decreased blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Our results identify tryptophan metabolism by Ido as a new pathway contributing to the regulation of vascular tone."
https://openalex.org/W2113661251,"Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), also known as p21Cip1/Waf1, is a master downstream effector of tumor suppressors. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate through a high-throughput luciferase reporter screen that p21Cip1/Waf1 can be directly targeted by nearly 28 microRNAs (miRNAs). The results were further confirmed by a series of mutational analyses and luciferase reporter assays. These 28 miRNAs can substantially inhibit p21Cip1/Waf1 expression, predominantly at translational level. Many of these miRNAs were upregulated in cancers and might serve as modulators of oncogenesis. Furthermore, 8 of these 28 p21-regulating miRNAs are located in the chromosome 19 miRNA cluster, the largest miRNA gene cluster in humans, and they can clearly promote cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression in choriocarcinoma cells. In conclusion, our screening strategy provides an alternative approach to uncovering miRNA modulators of an individual mRNA, and it has identified multiple miRNAs that can suppress p21Cip1/Waf1 expression by directly targeting its 3' untranslated region."
https://openalex.org/W2018360235,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in solid tumors and cancer cell lines. In this study, we isolated a series of cancer cell clones, which were heterogeneous in growth rate, cell cycle distribution and expression profile of genes and proteins, from ovarian tumor specimens of a patient and identified a sub-population enriched for ovarian CSCs defined by CD24 phenotype. Experiments in vitro demonstrated CD24(+) sub-population possessed stem cell-like characteristics of remaining quiescence and more chemoresistant compared with CD24(-) fraction, as well as a specific capacity for self-renewal and differentiation. In addition, injection of 5 x 10(3) CD24(+) cells was able to form tumor xenografts in nude mice, whereas equal number of CD24(-) cells remained nontumorigenic. We also found that CD24(+) cells expressed higher mRNA levels of some 'stemness' genes, including Nestin, beta-catenin, Bmi-1, Oct4, Oct3/4, Notch1 and Notch4 which were involved in modulating many functions of stem cells, and lower E-cadherin mRNA level than CD24(-) cells. Altogether, these observations suggest human ovarian tumor cells are organized as a hierarchy and CD24 demarcates an ovarian cancer-initiating cell population. These findings will have important clinical applications for developing effective therapeutic strategies to treat ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2040170958,"Cancer cells upregulate glycolysis, increasing glucose uptake to meet energy needs. A small fraction of a cell's glucose enters the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which regulates levels of O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), a carbohydrate posttranslational modification of diverse nuclear and cytosolic proteins. We discovered that breast cancer cells upregulate the HBP, including increased O-GlcNAcation and elevated expression of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which is the enzyme catalyzing the addition of O-GlcNAc to proteins. Reduction of O-GlcNAcation through RNA interference of OGT in breast cancer cells leads to inhibition of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo and is associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and increased expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27(Kip1). Elevation of p27(Kip1) was associated with decreased expression and activity of the oncogenic transcription factor FoxM1, a known regulator of p27(Kip1) stability through transcriptional control of Skp2. Reducing O-GlcNAc levels in breast cancer cells decreased levels of FoxM1 protein and caused a decrease in multiple FoxM1-specific targets, including Skp2. Moreover, reducing O-GlcNAcation decreased cancer cell invasion and was associated with the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-2, a known FoxM1 target. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of OGT in breast cancer cells had similar anti-growth and anti-invasion effects. These findings identify O-GlcNAc as a novel mechanism through which alterations in glucose metabolism regulate cancer growth and invasion and suggest that OGT may represent novel therapeutic targets for breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2045998598,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as novel cancer genes. In particular, the miR-17-92 cluster, containing six individual miRNAs, is highly expressed in haematopoietic cancers and promotes lymphomagenesis in vivo. Clinical use of these findings hinges on isolating the oncogenic activity within the 17-92 cluster and defining its relevant target genes. Here we show that miR-19 is sufficient to promote leukaemogenesis in Notch1-induced T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) in vivo. In concord with the pathogenic importance of this interaction in T-ALL, we report a novel translocation that targets the 17-92 cluster and coincides with a second rearrangement that activates Notch1. To identify the miR-19 targets responsible for its oncogenic action, we conducted a large-scale short hairpin RNA screen for genes whose knockdown can phenocopy miR-19. Strikingly, the results of this screen were enriched for miR-19 target genes, and include Bim (Bcl2L11), AMP-activated kinase (Prkaa1) and the phosphatases Pten and PP2A (Ppp2r5e). Hence, an unbiased, functional genomics approach reveals a coordinate clampdown on several regulators of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase-related survival signals by the leukaemogenic miR-19."
https://openalex.org/W2071437006,"We describe a strategy for comprehending signaling pathways that are active in lung cancer cells and that are targeted by dasatinib using chemical proteomics to identify direct interacting proteins combined with immunoaffinity purification of tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides corresponding to activated tyrosine kinases. We identified nearly 40 different kinase targets of dasatinib. These include SRC-family kinase (SFK) members (LYN, SRC, FYN, LCK and YES), nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (FRK, BRK and ACK) and receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephrin receptors, DDR1 and EGFR). Using quantitative phosphoproteomics, we identified peptides corresponding to autophosphorylation sites of these tyrosine kinases that are inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by dasatinib. Using drug-resistant gatekeeper mutants, we show that SFKs (particularly SRC and FYN), as well as EGFR, are relevant targets for dasatinib action. The combined mass spectrometry-based approach described here provides a system-level view of dasatinib action in cancer cells and suggests both functional targets and a rationale for combinatorial therapeutic strategies."

https://openalex.org/W1993272766,"There is much interest in the nitration and oxidation reaction mechanisms initiated by superoxide radical anion (O2̇̄) and nitric oxide (•NO). It is well known that O2̇̄ and •NO rapidly react to form a potent oxidant, peroxynitrite anion (ONOO−). However, indirect measurements with the existing probes (e.g. dihydrorhodamine) previously revealed a bell-shaped response to co-generated •NO and O2̇̄ fluxes, with the maximal yield of the oxidation or nitration product occurring at a 1:1 ratio.

Although these findings could implicate that ONOO− is formed at the maximal yield only at the 1:1 ratio of •NO/O2̇̄, one could also question the interpretations because of the confounding effects of radical-radical interactions from free radical species derived from ONOO− decomposition and probe-derived radicals (tyrosyl radical or rhodamine radical) (22Hodges G.R.

Med. 2005; 39: 728-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Clearly, there is an urgent need for developing direct probe(s) for ONOO− that will enable us to understand the chemical and biological interactions of •NO with O2̇̄.We have recently shown that boronic compounds (boronic acids and their esters) react stoichiometrically with ONOO−, yielding the corresponding hydroxylated compounds as the major products (30Sikora A. Zielonka J. Lopez M. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We have proposed that boronate groups attached to the fluorogenic probes may be used in the detection of ONOO− both in cell-free and in cellular systems. As the rate constant of the reaction of arylboronates with ONOO− is relatively high (∼106 m−1s−1 at pH 7.4), it can outcompete other reactions resulting from the decay of ONOO− and can be used to monitor ONOO− levels under different conditions.Here we report the development of a novel fluorescent probe for ONOO− and resolve a long standing controversy with regard to the identity, reaction profile, and yields of oxidant formed from varying ratios of •NO to O2̇̄ fluxes. We synthesized and employed the boronate-based fluorogenic probe, namely coumarin-7-boronic acid (CBA, Fig. 1), to monitor ONOO− formed under varying fluxes of O2̇̄ and •NO. Contrary to previous results obtained with tyrosine and DHR probes (22Hodges G.R. Marwaha J. Paul T. Ingold K.U. Chem. Res.

Chem. 2006; 281: 25984-25993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we report in this study, using a boronate probe, that ONOO− is the major species formed under various flux ratios of •NO and O2̇̄ and that there is no bell-shaped response in ONOO− formation. We conclude that the bell-shaped response previously reported during the reaction between co-generated •NO and O2̇̄ is due to the free radical chemistry of the probe employed (tyrosine and dihydrorhodamine), which does not totally reflect the actual yield of ONOO− formation.FIGURE 1Scheme showing the conversion of CBA and CBE into the fluorescent product, COH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONCBE has previously been reported to react with H2O2, resulting in the formation of a highly fluorescent COH (umbelliferone) (32Du L. Li M. Zheng S. Wang B. Tetrahedron Lett. 2008; 49: 3045-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that coumarin-7-boronic acid reacts rapidly and stoichiometrically with ONOO− to give COH as the major product (∼81%). This is similar to what had been published with simple arylboronates, indicating that the reaction between boronates and ONOO− is quite general (30Sikora A. Zielonka J. Lopez M. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The rate of reaction between CBA and ONOO− is at least a million times faster than between CBA and H2O2, and even at low micromolar concentrations, the boronate probes can effectively compete with the self-decomposition of ONOO− at neutral pH. To our knowledge, this is the first report using a fluorogenic probe that reacts directly and stoichiometrically with ONOO−. The probe can successfully scavenge ONOO− added as a bolus or formed from co-generated •NO and O2̇̄, thus allowing for real-time monitoring of ONOO− formation in biological systems.To confirm the identity of the oxidant trapped, we tested the effects of SOD and catalase on the yield of the fluorescent product formation (Fig. 6). The results are consistent with the oxidation of the probe by an oxidant formed from interaction of •NO and O2̇̄. From our earlier studies, we can conclude that ONOO− but not nitrogen oxides (•NO, •NO2) is responsible for oxidation of the boronate probe (30Sikora A. Zielonka J. Lopez M. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The lack of a total inhibition of the oxidation by SOD, even in the presence of catalase and at a high concentration of SOD (up to 1 mg/ml), can be explained by the dynamic competition between •NO and SOD for O2̇̄ as follows. SOD effectively competes with •NO in removing O2̇̄, causing a rise in the steady-state concentration of •NO that can again effectively compete with SOD for O2̇̄ (43Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-CC1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This proposal was indeed confirmed by the kinetic simulations of the inhibitory effects of SOD, yielding the same degree of inhibition of CBA oxidation by the •NO/O2̇̄ system, as noted experimentally (supplemental Figs. S7 and S8). Additionally, the kinetic simulations predicted an increase in the steady-state •NO levels upon the addition of SOD, as reported previously (43Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-CC1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction pathways involved in the oxidation of CBA to COH and the inhibitory effects of SOD and catalase in the present study are shown in Fig. 8.FIGURE 8Proposed reaction pathways in the oxidation of CBA to COH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We used the coumarin boronate to resolve the long standing controversy regarding the yield of ONOO−, formed under different fluxes of •NO and O2̇̄. Previous studies indicate that in cell-free systems, tyrosine nitration/oxidation and dihydrorhodamine oxidation are maximal only when the rates of generation of •NO to O2̇̄ are equal and that the probe oxidation and nitration declined drastically with increasing flux of either species (22Hodges G.R. Marwaha J. Paul T. Ingold K.U. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24Miles A.M. Bohle D.S. Glassbrenner P.A. Hansert B. Wink D.A. Grisham M.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32467-32474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The net effect is a bell-shaped response of the yield of reaction product versus the flux of one species at the constant flux of the other co-reactant. A bell-shaped response in DHR oxidation in the presence of various ratios of •NO to O2̇̄ fluxes in cellular systems was also reported (26Thomas D.D. Ridnour L.A. Espey M.G. Donzelli S. Ambs S. Hussain S.P. Harris C.C. DeGraff W. Roberts D.D. Mitchell J.B. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25984-25993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These findings called into question the nature of the identity of the oxidant formed from the reaction of •NO with O2̇̄ under various ratios of both species. The lack of availability of a chemical probe that would react quickly and stoichiometrically with ONOO− hampered the progress in the understanding of the chemistry of the interaction of •NO with O2̇̄. Both tyrosine and dihydrorhodamine react with the free radical product(s) of ONOO− decomposition rather than with ONOO− itself, complicating the analysis of the primary events in the interaction between •NO and O2̇̄. In this study, we used the fluorogenic boronic probe, which reacts directly with ONOO−, outcompeting the decomposition of ONOO− into the radical products. Our results directly prove that ONOO− is the primary product of the reaction of O2̇̄ with •NO over a wide range of •NO to O2̇̄ fluxes. Thus, the previously reported bell-shaped responses, which do not accurately reflect the chemistry of O2̇̄/•NO interaction, are due to free radical-dependent oxidation and nitration of the probe molecules (tyrosine and dihydrorhodamine) and reactions of probe-derived radicals with •NO and O2̇̄. The ongoing research indicates that the boronate-based fluorogenic probes can be used for real-time monitoring of ONOO− generation in cellular systems (46Zielonka J. Sikora A. Zielonka M. Joseph J.

Although these findings could implicate that ONOO− is formed at the maximal yield only at the 1:1 ratio of •NO/O2̇̄, one could also question the interpretations because of the confounding effects of radical-radical interactions from free radical species derived from ONOO− decomposition and probe-derived radicals (tyrosyl radical or rhodamine radical) (22Hodges G.R.

Clearly, there is an urgent need for developing direct probe(s) for ONOO− that will enable us to understand the chemical and biological interactions of •NO with O2̇̄. We have recently shown that boronic compounds (boronic acids and their esters) react stoichiometrically with ONOO−, yielding the corresponding hydroxylated compounds as the major products (30Sikora A. Zielonka J. Lopez M. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We have proposed that boronate groups attached to the fluorogenic probes may be used in the detection of ONOO− both in cell-free and in cellular systems. As the rate constant of the reaction of arylboronates with ONOO− is relatively high (∼106 m−1s−1 at pH 7.4), it can outcompete other reactions resulting from the decay of ONOO− and can be used to monitor ONOO− levels under different conditions. Here we report the development of a novel fluorescent probe for ONOO− and resolve a long standing controversy with regard to the identity, reaction profile, and yields of oxidant formed from varying ratios of •NO to O2̇̄ fluxes. We synthesized and employed the boronate-based fluorogenic probe, namely coumarin-7-boronic acid (CBA, Fig. 1), to monitor ONOO− formed under varying fluxes of O2̇̄ and •NO. Contrary to previous results obtained with tyrosine and DHR probes (22Hodges G.R. Marwaha J. Paul T. Ingold K.U. Chem. Res.

DISCUSSIONCBE has previously been reported to react with H2O2, resulting in the formation of a highly fluorescent COH (umbelliferone) (32Du L. Li M. Zheng S. Wang B. Tetrahedron Lett. 2008; 49: 3045-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that coumarin-7-boronic acid reacts rapidly and stoichiometrically with ONOO− to give COH as the major product (∼81%). This is similar to what had been published with simple arylboronates, indicating that the reaction between boronates and ONOO− is quite general (30Sikora A. Zielonka J. Lopez M. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The rate of reaction between CBA and ONOO− is at least a million times faster than between CBA and H2O2, and even at low micromolar concentrations, the boronate probes can effectively compete with the self-decomposition of ONOO− at neutral pH. To our knowledge, this is the first report using a fluorogenic probe that reacts directly and stoichiometrically with ONOO−. The probe can successfully scavenge ONOO− added as a bolus or formed from co-generated •NO and O2̇̄, thus allowing for real-time monitoring of ONOO− formation in biological systems.To confirm the identity of the oxidant trapped, we tested the effects of SOD and catalase on the yield of the fluorescent product formation (Fig. 6). The results are consistent with the oxidation of the probe by an oxidant formed from interaction of •NO and O2̇̄. From our earlier studies, we can conclude that ONOO− but not nitrogen oxides (•NO, •NO2) is responsible for oxidation of the boronate probe (30Sikora A. Zielonka J. Lopez M. Joseph J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 1401-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The lack of a total inhibition of the oxidation by SOD, even in the presence of catalase and at a high concentration of SOD (up to 1 mg/ml), can be explained by the dynamic competition between •NO and SOD for O2̇̄ as follows. SOD effectively competes with •NO in removing O2̇̄, causing a rise in the steady-state concentration of •NO that can again effectively compete with SOD for O2̇̄ (43Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-CC1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 402: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This proposal was indeed confirmed by the kinetic simulations of the inhibitory effects of SOD, yielding the same degree of inhibition of CBA oxidation by the •NO/O2̇̄ system, as noted experimentally (supplemental Figs. S7 and S8). Additionally, the kinetic simulations predicted an increase in the steady-state •NO levels upon the addition of SOD, as reported previously (43Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-CC1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction pathways involved in the oxidation of CBA to COH and the inhibitory effects of SOD and catalase in the present study are shown in Fig. 8.We used the coumarin boronate to resolve the long standing controversy regarding the yield of ONOO−, formed under different fluxes of •NO and O2̇̄. Previous studies indicate that in cell-free systems, tyrosine nitration/oxidation and dihydrorhodamine oxidation are maximal only when the rates of generation of •NO to O2̇̄ are equal and that the probe oxidation and nitration declined drastically with increasing flux of either species (22Hodges G.R.

The net effect is a bell-shaped response of the yield of reaction product versus the flux of one species at the constant flux of the other co-reactant. A bell-shaped response in DHR oxidation in the presence of various ratios of •NO to O2̇̄ fluxes in cellular systems was also reported (26Thomas D.D. Ridnour L.A. Espey M.G. Donzelli S. Ambs S.

These findings called into question the nature of the identity of the oxidant formed from the reaction of •NO with O2̇̄ under various ratios of both species. The lack of availability of a chemical probe that would react quickly and stoichiometrically with ONOO− hampered the progress in the understanding of the chemistry of the interaction of •NO with O2̇̄. Both tyrosine and dihydrorhodamine react with the free radical product(s) of ONOO− decomposition rather than with ONOO− itself, complicating the analysis of the primary events in the interaction between •NO and O2̇̄. In this study, we used the fluorogenic boronic probe, which reacts directly with ONOO−, outcompeting the decomposition of ONOO− into the radical products. Our results directly prove that ONOO− is the primary product of the reaction of O2̇̄ with •NO over a wide range of •NO to O2̇̄ fluxes. Thus, the previously reported bell-shaped responses, which do not accurately reflect the chemistry of O2̇̄/•NO interaction, are due to free radical-dependent oxidation and nitration of the probe molecules (tyrosine and dihydrorhodamine) and reactions of probe-derived radicals with •NO and O2̇̄. The ongoing research indicates that the boronate-based fluorogenic probes can be used for real-time monitoring of ONOO− generation in cellular systems (46Zielonka J. Sikora A. Zielonka M. Joseph J.

In a variety of cancer cells, overactivation of mTOR has been reported. In addition, mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin and its derivatives, are being evaluated in clinical trials as anticancer drugs. However, no active mutants of mTOR have been identified in human cancer. Here, we report that two different point mutations, S2215Y and R2505P, identified in human cancer genome database confer constitutive activation of mTOR signaling even under nutrient starvation conditions. S2215Y was identified in large intestine adenocarcinoma whereas R2505P was identified in renal cell carcinoma. mTOR complex 1 prepared from cells expressing the mutant mTOR after nutrient starvation still retains the activity to phosphorylate 4E-BP1 in vitro. The cells expressing the mTOR mutant show increased percentage of S-phase cells and exhibit resistance to cell size decrease by amino-acid starvation. The activated mutants are still sensitive to rapamycin. However, they show increased resistance to 1-butanol. Our study points to the idea that mTOR activating mutations can be identified in a wide range of human cancer."

While, it is known that the PLETHORA genes function as master regulators of root fate, the regulators of shoot fate are unknown. Zachery Smith and Jeff Long now show that the Class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) transcription factors are master regulators of embryonic apical shoot fate, and that they are sufficient to drive the conversion of the embryonic root pole into a second shoot pole. During development in Arabidopsis plants, populations of shoot stem cells and root stem cells are established at the embryo's apical and basal poles, respectively. PLETHORA genes are master regulators of root fate, but the regulators of shoot fate were unknown. Here, CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER genes are identified as master regulators of apical/shoot fate, and are shown to be sufficient to convert the embryonic root pole into a second shoot pole. Plants, similarly to animals, form polarized axes during embryogenesis on which cell differentiation and organ patterning programs are orchestrated. During Arabidopsis embryogenesis, establishment of the shoot and root stem cell populations occurs at opposite ends of an apical–basal axis. Recent work has identified the PLETHORA (PLT) genes as master regulators of basal/root fate1,2,3, whereas the master regulators of apical/shoot fate have remained elusive. Here we show that the PLT1 and PLT2 genes are direct targets of the transcriptional co-repressor TOPLESS (TPL) and that PLT1/2 are necessary for the homeotic conversion of shoots to roots in tpl-1 mutants. Using tpl-1 as a genetic tool, we identify the CLASS III HOMEODOMAIN-LEUCINE ZIPPER (HD-ZIP III) transcription factors as master regulators of embryonic apical fate, and show they are sufficient to drive the conversion of the embryonic root pole into a second shoot pole. Furthermore, genetic and misexpression studies show an antagonistic relationship between the PLT and HD-ZIP III genes in specifying the root and shoot poles."

Engineering of the glycosylation machinery of C. jejuni and its transfer into E. coli, combined with trimming and rebuilding of the N-linked glycan, now provides a robust route to glycoproteins. We describe a new method for producing homogeneous eukaryotic N-glycoproteins. The method involves the engineering and functional transfer of the Campylobacter jejuni glycosylation machinery in Escherichia coli to express glycosylated proteins with the key GlcNAc-Asn linkage. The bacterial glycans were then trimmed and remodeled in vitro by enzymatic transglycosylation to fulfill a eukaryotic N-glycosylation.

https://openalex.org/W2020969330,"Cholesterol is a structural component of lipid rafts within the plasma membrane. These domains, used as platforms for various signaling molecules, regulate cellular processes including cell survival. Cholesterol contents are tightly correlated with the structure and function of lipid rafts. Liver X receptors (LXRs) have a central role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis within the cell. Therefore, we investigated whether these nuclear receptors could modulate lipid raft signaling and consequently alter prostate cancer (PCa) cell survival. Treatment with the synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 downregulated the AKT survival pathway and thus induced apoptosis of LNCaP PCa cells in both xenografted nude mice and cell culture. The decrease in tumor cholesterol content resulted from the upregulation of ABCG1 and the subsequent increase in reverse cholesterol transport. RNA interference experiments showed that these effects were mediated by LXRs. Atomic force microscopy scanning of the inner plasma membrane sheet showed smaller and thinner lipid rafts after LXR stimulation, associated with the downregulation of AKT phosphorylation in these lipid rafts. Replenishment of cell membranes with exogenous cholesterol antagonized these effects, showing that cholesterol is a key modulator in this process. Altogether, pharmacological modulation of LXR activity could thus reduce prostate tumor growth by enhancing apoptosis in a lipid raft-dependent manner."

Mutations in VPS33B account for most cases of ARC. We identified mutations in VIPAR (also called C14ORF133) in individuals with ARC without VPS33B defects. We show that VIPAR forms a functional complex with VPS33B that interacts with RAB11A. Knockdown of vipar in zebrafish resulted in biliary excretion and E-cadherin defects similar to those in individuals with ARC. Vipar- and Vps33b-deficient mouse inner medullary collecting duct (mIMDC-3) cells expressed membrane proteins abnormally and had structural and functional tight junction defects. Abnormal Ceacam5 expression was due to mis-sorting toward lysosomal degradation, but reduced E-cadherin levels were associated with transcriptional downregulation. The VPS33B-VIPAR complex thus has diverse functions in the pathways regulating apical-basolateral polarity in the liver and kidney."

Shapiro et al. use directed evolution to generate a protein probe that enables magnetic resonance imaging of the neurotransmitter dopamine. The development of molecular probes that allow in vivo imaging of neural signaling processes with high temporal and spatial resolution remains challenging. Here we applied directed evolution techniques to create magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents sensitive to the neurotransmitter dopamine. The sensors were derived from the heme domain of the bacterial cytochrome P450-BM3 (BM3h). Ligand binding to a site near BM3h's paramagnetic heme iron led to a drop in MRI signal enhancement and a shift in optical absorbance. Using an absorbance-based screen, we evolved the specificity of BM3h away from its natural ligand and toward dopamine, producing sensors with dissociation constants for dopamine of 3.3–8.9 μM. These molecules were used to image depolarization-triggered neurotransmitter release from PC12 cells and in the brains of live animals. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of molecular-level functional MRI using neural activity–dependent sensors, and our protein engineering approach can be generalized to create probes for other targets."

Our study was designed to test whether epigenomic dysregulation mediates the cellular memory of this intrauterine event. To test this hypothesis, we isolated pancreatic islets from control and IUGR (induced by bilateral uterine artery ligation at day 18 of fetal life) animals at 7 weeks of age. Using the HELP (HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR) assay, we generated the first DNA methylation map at almost 1 million unique sites throughout the rat genome in normal pancreatic islet cells, allowing us to identify the changes that occur as a consequence of IUGR. We validated candidate dysregulated loci with quantitative assays of cytosine methylation and gene expression. IUGR changes cytosine methylation at ∼1,400 loci (false discovery rate of 4.2%) in male rats at 7 weeks of age, preceding the development of diabetes and thus representing candidate loci for mediating the pathogenesis of metabolic disease that occurs later in life. Epigenetic dysregulation occurred preferentially at conserved intergenic sequences, frequently near genes regulating processes known to be abnormal in IUGR islets, such as vascularization, β-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and cell death, associated with concordant changes in mRNA expression.

These changes are often present at birth or during early life, and can precede the development of overt disease in rodents by months and in humans by decades. Although the mechanisms that may mediate the “fetal origin of adult disease” (7Barker D.J. J. Intern. Med. 2007; 261: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar) remain unclear, dysregulation of the epigenome could play an important role and may explain the changes in gene expression that are heritably maintained through cell divisions in IUGR animals throughout life (8Simmons R.A. Pediatr. Res. 2007; 61: 64R-67RCrossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). type 2 diabetes mellitus intrauterine growth restriction HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR cytosine-guanine dinucleotide reverse transcription. We have developed an animal model of IUGR caused by uteroplacental insufficiency, which limits the supply of critical substrates (e.g. nutrients, oxygen, growth factors, and hormones) to the fetus (9Simmons R.A. Templeton L.J. Gertz S.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). This deficient intrauterine environment affects fetal development through permanent and progressive dysregulation of gene expression and function of susceptible cells (e.g. pancreatic β-cells) and leads to the development of T2DM in adulthood (3Stoffers D.A. Desai B.M. DeLeon D.D. Simmons R.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Simmons R.A. Suponitsky-Kroyter I. Selak M.A. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). In particular, expression of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1), a transcription factor critical for the regulation of pancreatic development and β-cell differentiation, shows progressive decline in IUGR offspring, with a complete absence of Pdx1 levels in adult rats (3Stoffers D.A. Desai B.M. DeLeon D.D. Simmons R.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Moreover, this decline in gene expression is associated with progressive changes in epigenetic regulation at the Pdx1 proximal promoter, through early and progressive alterations in histone post-translational modifications. DNA methylation at this locus is not acquired until much later in life (10Park J.H. Stoffers D.A. Nicholls R.D. Simmons R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previous studies have focused primarily on the identification of epigenetic dysregulation at specific candidate sites, often at promoters of genes of interest (10Park J.H. Stoffers D.A. Nicholls R.D. Simmons R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this report, we use the genome-wide HELP assay (11Oda M. Glass J.L. Thompson R.F. Mo Y. Olivier E.N. Figueroa M.E. Selzer R.R. Richmond T.A. Zhang X. Dannenberg L. Green R.D. Melnick A. Hatchwell E. Bouhassira E.E. Verma A. Suzuki M. Greally J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 3829-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), to define patterns of cytosine methylation at almost 1 million loci in IUGR and control rats. Both groups of animals were studied at the age of 7 weeks, prior to the onset of hyperglycemia in the IUGR animals (12Vuguin P. Raab E. Liu B. Barzilai N. Simmons R. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 2617-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), thus avoiding the confounding effects of overt diabetes. Dysregulation of pancreatic islet β-cell function and development plays a central role in the pathogenesis of diabetes in humans and animal models of IUGR (13Muoio D.M. Newgard C.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). We therefore chose to study isolated pancreatic islets, consisting of ∼95% β-cells by cellular mass (14Finegood D.T. Scaglia L. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), as candidates for mediating the functional consequences of IUGR-induced epigenetic changes. Comparison of IUGR with normal rats revealed changes in DNA methylation at a number of novel loci, not limited to canonical CpG islands or promoters. The specific loci affected are in proximity to genes with important roles in β cell function and development. Epigenomic dysregulation may therefore mediate the cellular memory of intrauterine events that are causally associated with adult disease susceptibility. Surgical methods have been described previously (9Simmons R.A. Templeton L.J. Gertz S.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). On day 18 of gestation, time-dated Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats underwent bilateral uterine artery ligation. Controls underwent sham surgery. Pregnant rats were allowed to deliver spontaneously, and the litter size was randomly reduced to 8 at birth to assure uniformity of litter size between IUGR and controls. IUGR and control pups were fostered to unoperated normal female rats and remained with their foster mothers until they were weaned. Only male animals were studied to avoid the potentially confounding influence of hormonal variability. Pancreatic islets were isolated using the Ficoll gradient method (Scharp (48)) from 8 litters each of 7-week-old IUGR and control animals, with islets pooled from a litter as previously described (9Simmons R.A. Templeton L.J. Gertz S.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated islets were used for all studies. To remove the confounding factors contributed by even slight differences in purity between islet preparations, we use quantitative RT-PCR to determine the relative levels of endocrine (insulin) and exocrine (amylase) gene expression levels in each sample as previously described (15Thompson R.F. Reimers M. Khulan B. Gissot M. Richmond T.A. Chen Q. Zheng X. Kim K. Greally J.M. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This approach allowed us to determine that there was negligible exocrine tissue contamination of isolated pancreatic islets. Using total pancreas RNA for comparison and quantitative RT-PCR, we calculated the enrichment of endocrine mRNA for each of our samples, which averaged 99.1%. Similarly, β-cell fold enrichment (using insulin and glucagon) of islet preps averaged 94.6%. These studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania. To define genome-wide patterns of DNA methylation in isolated pancreatic islets of IUGR offspring and controls, we used a high resolution microarray-based approach (HELP (11Oda M. Glass J.L. Thompson R.F. Mo Y. Olivier E.N. Figueroa M.E. Selzer R.R. Richmond T.A. Zhang X. Dannenberg L. Green R.D. Melnick A. Hatchwell E. Bouhassira E.E. Verma A. Suzuki M. Greally J.M.

Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1046-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar)) designed to test almost a million sites throughout the rat genome, representing promoters, CpG islands, CG clusters (17Glass J.L. Thompson R.F. Khulan B. Figueroa M.E. Olivier E.N. Oakley E.J. Van Zant G. Bouhassira E.E. Melnick A. Golden A. Fazzari M.J. Greally J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6798-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), genes, and intergenic regions. Genomic DNA was isolated, digested to completion by either HpaII or MspI separately, and ligated to a mixture of two adapters with overhanging ends complementary to those generated by the restriction digestion. The adapters were used for ligation-mediated PCR to generate products predominantly in the 50- to 2000-bp size range (11Oda M. Glass J.L. Thompson R.F. Mo Y. Olivier E.N. Figueroa M.E. Selzer R.R. Richmond T.A. Zhang X. Dannenberg L. Green R.D. Melnick A. Hatchwell E. Bouhassira E.E. Verma A. Suzuki M. Greally J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 3829-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Following PCR, the HpaII and MspI representations were labeled with different fluorophores using random priming and were then cohybridized on a customized genomic microarray representing 917,301 HpaII/MspI fragments of 50–2000 bp in the rat genome. Microarray data were pre-processed and subject to quality control and quantile normalization as we have previously described (15Thompson R.F. Reimers M. Khulan B. Gissot M. Richmond T.A. Chen Q. Zheng X. Kim K. Greally J.M. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HpaII/MspI ratio values were then compared between groups for all loci throughout the rat genome using a standard t test for IUGR (n = 4) and controls (n = 4). Changes in methylation state were defined using a HpaII/MspI ratio threshold of zero, where heavily methylated and relatively hypomethylated loci had ratio values less than and greater than zero, respectively. An ordered list of differences was generated using the formula: −log(p) × |IUGR − control|. This method, similar to a modified t test (18Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9774) Google Scholar), places more weight on the -fold change relative to the within-group variability. However, unlike p values based on the modified t test, computed values are not interpreted in these studies as a probabilistic quantity, and instead are used exclusively to rank and isolate important loci for further validation. The top 100 loci, identified by means of the ranking system described above, were mapped to RefSeq gene identifiers by location <100 kb upstream of the transcription start site or overlapping the gene body. The list of RefSeq identifiers was then uploaded to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis program (Redwood City, CA) and mapped to corresponding gene objects (focus genes) in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base, enabling exploration of ontology and molecular interaction networks. Core networks were constructed for both direct and indirect interactions using default parameters. The ranking score for each network was then computed by a right-tailed Fisher's exact test as the negative log of the probability that the number of focus genes in the network is not due to random chance. Similarly, significances for functional enrichment of specific genes were also determined by the right-tailed Fisher's exact test, using all genes on the microarray as a reference set. Target regions were amplified by PCR using the primers and cycling conditions described in supplemental Table 1. Primers were selected with MethPrimer (available on-line) using parameters as follows: 250–450 bp amplicon size, 56–60 °C Tm, 24–30 bp length, and ≥1 CG in product. PCR reactions were carried out using the Roche FastStart High Fidelity Kit. In cases where products showed primer-dimer or nonspecific amplification, expected bands were excised from 2% agarose gels, purified by the Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit, and eluted with 1× Roche FastStart High Fidelity Reaction Buffer (+MgCl2). Sequenom MassArray assays were performed using the company's standard protocol through Einstein's Genomics Shared Facility. Matched peak data were exported using EpiTYPER software and analyzed for quality and single nucleotide polymorphisms using analytical tools that we have developed (19Thompson R.F. Suzuki M. Lau K.W. Greally J.M. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 2164-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). mRNA expression levels were determined for eight genes by quantitative RT-PCR. These genes were chosen for having either no changes in methylation in their vicinity (Hint3, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Gadd45a) or, from the top 100 loci with methylation changes, those with multiple reproducible changes nearby (Fgfr1, Gch1, Vgf, and Pcsk5). Total RNA was extracted from islets of 7-week-old IUGR and control animals (n = 5 from each group) using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Integrity was confirmed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer. cDNA was generated using the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase kit (Invitrogen), and real-time quantitative PCR was carried out in triplicate using an ABI 7900HT Real Time PCR system with SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Results were normalized to β-actin expression and expressed as -fold change compared with control rats. Intron-spanning primers were designed to target exons conserved across the maximal number of expressed mRNA transcripts in the rat genome (primers are listed in supplemental Table 2). We performed a whole genome cytosine methylation assay on pancreatic islets isolated at 7 weeks from Sprague-Dawley rats in each of two groups: IUGR offspring (n = 4) and their sham-operated controls (n = 4), and confirmed overall data quality for each sample as previously described (15Thompson R.F. Reimers M. Khulan B. Gissot M. Richmond T.A. Chen Q. Zheng X. Kim K. Greally J.M. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 1161-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To detect global patterns of epigenomic change distinguishing IUGR and control animals, we compared one thousand randomly selected loci to generate a representative heat map. This unsupervised clustering approach showed consistent patterns of methylation across all samples, without any apparent global shift toward hypo- or hypermethylation in the IUGR group (supplemental Fig. 1). Global Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the methylation patterns for each pair of samples, confirming a high degree of inter-sample consistency (R = 0.90–0.96, supplemental Fig. 2). To detect locus-specific epigenetic changes, t tests comparing IUGR and control animals were applied to all individual loci represented on our arrays. This analysis yielded a subset of potentially informative sites with statistically significant differences in methylation. Fig. 1A shows the overall distribution of p values observed for IUGR compared with controls, with a comparable p value distribution calculated for grouping by random permutation (Fig. 1B), reflective of what we would see under the null distribution of no group effect. The IUGR and control group comparisons identify consistently and distinctively methylated loci, with 237 candidate loci enriched for highly significant group differences (p < 1.0 × 10−6, chosen because no iterations of random permutation had a p value below 1.08 × 10−6), and an additional 1675 loci with moderate group differences (p < 0.0001). Additionally, we applied significance analysis of microarrays (18Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9774) Google Scholar) to the data and show a resulting Q–Q plot (supplemental Fig. 3), which demonstrates ∼1,400 changes in methylation with an estimated false discovery rate of 4.2%. We created a heat map of the top 1000 differentially methylated loci and found that this subset of loci readily distinguishes between IUGR and controls, without an overall tendency toward decreased or increased methylation in either group (Fig. 1C). The genomic distributions of methylation were determined for both normal and IUGR pancreatic islets. The data were partitioned into three non-overlapping subsets: (i) consistently hypomethylated sites in both normal and IUGR tissues (average log2(HpaII/MspI) > 2); (ii) consistently hypermethylated sites (average log2(HpaII/MspI) < −1); and (iii) the top 1000 differentially methylated loci. The observed number and associated probabilities of whole and partial sequence overlaps with CpG islands, CG clusters (17Glass J.L. Thompson R.F. Khulan B. Figueroa M.E. Olivier E.N. Oakley E.J. Van Zant G. Bouhassira E.E. Melnick A. Golden A. Fazzari M.J. Greally J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6798-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), conserved elements, repeat-masked sequences, gene bodies, and promoters were determined for each of these subsets of loci (supplemental Table 3) using UCSC Genome Browser annotation data (20Kent W.J. Sugnet C.W. Furey T.S. Roskin K.M. Pringle T.H. Zahler A.M. Haussler D. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 996-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (6789) Google Scholar). Because there has never been a report of genome-wide methylation patterns in rat, nor in normal pancreatic islets, we first investigated the distribution of cytosine methylation in the control animals, focusing on sites that are constitutively hypo- or hypermethylated in all samples. The distributions we observed for genomic sequence compartments in normal islets were consistent with prior studies in other mammals, with hypomethylated loci highly enriched at CpG islands and CG clusters (Fig. 2), as observed in human and mouse (17Glass J.L. Thompson R.F. Khulan B. Figueroa M.E. Olivier E.N. Oakley E.J. Van Zant G. Bouhassira E.E. Melnick A. Golden A. Fazzari M.J. Greally J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 6798-6807Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Bird A. Taggart M. Frommer M. Miller O.J. Macleod D. Cell. 1985; 40: 91-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Additionally, hypomethylated loci were highly enriched at promoters, and to a lesser extent in gene bodies and conserved sequences (Fig. 2). Repetitive sequences tended to be constitutively hypermethylated (Fig. 2), as has been previously observed in other species (22Yang A.S. Estécio M.R. Doshi K. Kondo Y. Tajara E.H. Issa J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e38Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Normal pancreatic islets therefore have overall patterns of methylation typical of primary cells from Eutherian mammals. This reference cytosine methylation map is the first published for the rat genome and the first for pancreatic islets in any species, and is available both from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (accession number: GSE16839) and as an open-access University of California Santa Cruz genome browser-compatible resource available on-line. We next investigated how these normal patterns of cytosine methylation are dysregulated in IUGR islets. The 1000 most differentially methylated loci were under-represented at gene bodies and promoters as well as CpG islands and CG clusters (Fig. 2). However, they were highly enriched at conserved non-coding intergenic sequences, which may represent important cis-regulatory sites influencing local gene expression (23Pennacchio L.A. Ahituv N. Moses A.M. Prabhakar S. Nobrega M.A. Shoukry M. Minovitsky S. Dubchak I. Holt A. Lewis K.D. Plajzer-Frick I. Akiyama J. De Val S. Afzal V. Black B.L. Couronne O. Eisen M.B. Visel A. Rubin E.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). The cytosine methylation data from the IUGR animals are also provided as a University of California Santa Cruz genome browser track on-line. We confirmed our HELP results with a quantitative validation approach, bisulfite MassArray (24Ehrich M. Nelson M.R. Stanssens P. Zabeau M. Liloglou T. Xinarianos G. Cantor C.R. Field J.K. van den Boom D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15785-15790Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), focusing initially on four loci, two each representing constitutively hypomethylated and constitutively methylated sites identified by the HELP assay. Supplemental Fig. 4 shows a strong inverse correlation between methylation values determined independently for these loci by HELP and MassArray, confirming our ability to quantify the methylation status in these samples. We then tested whether the cytosine methylation differences found by HELP in IUGR rats compared with controls could be validated by bisulfite MassArray. Upstream of the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (Gch1) gene, the HELP assay identified multiple neighboring changes, with increased methylation in IUGR compared with control rats (supplemental Fig. 5). Among these sites, we identified a region located near a highly conserved non-coding element (present in all mammalian species) ∼45 kb upstream of the Gch1 transcription start site. Differences in methylation at this site were confirmed by bisulfite MassArray, with hypermethylation in IUGR compared with controls at an informative HpaII site (86.3% and 53.1% methylation, respectively; p = 0.003) and multiple neighboring CG dinucleotides (72.8% and 55.7% average overall methylation, respectively; p = 0.01) (Fig. 3A), consistent with the HELP data (log2(HpaII/MspI) = −0.27 ± 0.27 and 2.69 ± 0.59, respectively; p = 4.3 × 10−6). This degree of difference of cytosine methylation is of the magnitude we observe for tissue-specific differences in methylation at other loci (supplemental Fig. 6). Using our recently published analytical pipeline for bisulfite MassArray data (19Thompson R.F. Suzuki M. Lau K.W. Greally J.M. Bioinformatics. 2009; 25: 2164-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we identified one single nucleotide polymorphism in this region that confounded interpretation of methylation status at a single CG dinucleotide (Fig. 3A); therefore, this site was removed from consideration. We tested the cytosine methylation status for the Pdx1 proximal-promoter region. Experimental IUGR causes a permanent and progressive decrease in expression of Pdx1, which is associated with progressive epigenetic changes from a hypomethylated state at 2 weeks of age and culminating in DNA hypermethylation in the adult rat at age 6 months (10Park J.H. Stoffers D.A. Nicholls R.D. Simmons R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In our 7-week-old rats we found the Pdx1 proximal-promoter region to be hypomethylated in islets and indistinguishable from control animals (Fig. 3B). These findings are consistent with our previous studies in islets from young adult IUGR animals (10Park J.H. Stoffers D.A. Nicholls R.D. Simmons R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), narrowing the window in which the methylation is acquired to between 7 weeks and 6–8 months. We next investigated whether genes associated by proximity to the loci manifesting epigenetic dysregulation in IUGR shared any common functional roles or relationships. We performed ingenuity pathway analysis on the top 53 of 100 loci, which were linked to RefSeq-annotated genes (within 100 kb upstream of the transcription start site or within the gene body). Almost half of the 53 genes tested were associated together in a single functional network centered on a collection of important metabolic and cellular regulators, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase, protein kinase B, and nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) (with an associated chance of ∼10−49% that this network might arise randomly) (supplemental Fig. 7). This network also showed interaction of multiple genes directly relevant to β-islet cells, including integrin β5 (Itgb5), glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (Gsk3b), and vascular growth factor nerve growth factor inducible (Vgf). Ingenuity pathway analysis further revealed that the top 53 genes dysregulated in IUGR were significantly enriched for functions in endocrine development (p = 3.1 × 10−3), cellular proliferation and growth (p = 2.7 × 10−3), and cell death (p = 2.1 × 10−3), consistent with our previous observations of impaired β-cell proliferation and increased cell death in this model (3Stoffers D.A. Desai B.M. DeLeon D.D. Simmons R.A. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 734-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 6Simmons R.A. Suponitsky-Kroyter I. Selak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 28785-28791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cytosine methylation changes in islets from IUGR rats are therefore enriched near RefSeq genes that are candidates for mediating the later T2DM phenotype. To test whether these mostly non-promoter cytosine methylation changes were having functional effects on gene expression, quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine mRNA expression levels for eight genes, four of which had methylation changes identified by HELP located an average of ∼45 kb upstream of their transcription start sites (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1), Gch1, histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 3 (Hint3), and Vgf) and one of which was differentially methylated within 750 bp of its transcription start site (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 5 (Pcsk5)). The remaining three (DNA methyltransferases 3a and 3b (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) and growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible 45 alpha (Gadd45a)) are known or candidate regulators of global DNA methylation patterns (25Barreto G.

https://openalex.org/W1977149080,"Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and p53 critically determine cancer development and progression. Defining the cross talk between these transcription factors can expand our knowledge on molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Here, we show that induction of replicational stress activates NF-kappaB p65 and triggers its interaction with p53 in the nucleus. Experiments with knockout cells show that p65 and p53 are both required for enhanced NF-kappaB activity during S-phase checkpoint activation involving ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and checkpoint kinase-1. Accordingly, the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) also triggers formation of a transcriptionally active complex containing nuclear p65 and p53 on kappaB response elements. Gene expression analyses revealed that, independent of NF-kappaB activation in the cytosol, TNF-induced NF-kappaB-directed gene expression relies on p53. Hence, p53 is unexpectedly necessary for NF-kappaB-mediated gene expression induced by atypical and classical stimuli. Remarkably, data from gain- and loss-of function approaches argue that anti-apoptotic NF-kappaB p65 activity is constitutively evoked by a p53 hot-spot mutant frequently found in tumors. Our observations suggest explanations for the outstanding question why p53 mutations rather than p53 deletions arise in tumors of various origins."
https://openalex.org/W1982525225,"Histone Arg methylation and Lys acetylation have been found to cooperatively regulate the expression of p53-target genes. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is an enzyme that citrullinates histone arginine and monomethyl-arginine residues thereby regulating histone Arg methylation. We have recently found that PAD4 serves as a p53 corepressor to regulate histone Arg methylation at the p53-target gene p21/WAF1/CIP1 promoter. However, it has not been tested whether histone Arg citrullination coordinates with other histone modifications to repress transcription. Here, we show that histone deacetylase (HDAC2) and PAD4 interact with p53 through distinct domains and simultaneously associate with the p21 promoter to regulate gene expression. After DNA damage, PAD4 and HDAC2 dissociate from several p53-target gene promoters (for example, p21, GADD45, and PUMA) with a concomitant increase in histone Lys acetylation and Arg methylation at these promoters. Furthermore, PAD4 promoter association and histone Arg modifications are regulated by p53 and HDAC activity. In contrast, HDAC2 promoter association and histone Lys acetylation are affected by p53 and PAD4 activity at minor degrees. Importantly, PAD4 inhibitor Cl-amidine and HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid show additive effects in inducing p21, GADD45, and PUMA expression and inhibiting cancer cell growth in a p53-dependent manner. Our results unveil an important crosstalk between histone deacetylation and citrullination, suggesting that a combination of PAD4 and HDAC2 inhibitors as a potential strategy for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2080504257,"Profiling of a combinatorial library of post-translationally modified histone H3–based peptides reveals that Thr3 phosphorylation, Arg2 methylation and Thr6 phosphorylation can modulate recognition of Lys4 methylation status by PHD fingers. Additionally, Thr6 phosphorylation, a previously undescribed modification, is shown to exist in native histones. Specific interactions between post-translational modifications (PTMs) and chromatin-binding proteins are central to the idea of a 'histone code'. Here, we used a 5,000-member, PTM-randomized, combinatorial peptide library based on the N terminus of histone H3 to interrogate the multisite specificity of six chromatin binding modules, which read the methylation status of Lys4. We found that Thr3 phosphorylation, Arg2 methylation and Thr6 phosphorylation are critical additional PTMs that modulate the ability to recognize and bind histone H3. Notably, phosphorylation of Thr6 yielded the most varied effect on protein binding, suggesting an important regulatory mechanism for readers of the H3 tail. Mass spectrometry and antibody-based evidence indicate that this previously uncharacterized modification exists on native H3, and NMR analysis of ING2 revealed the structural basis for discrimination. These investigations reveal a continuum of binding affinities in which multisite PTM recognition involves both switch- and rheostat-like properties, yielding graded effects that depend on the inherent 'reader' specificity."

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a new tool for the delivery of therapeutic agents to tumor cells. This study used an orthotopic nude mice model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to evaluate the potential of genetically modified human MSCs (hMSCs), to function as an effective delivery vehicle for therapeutic genes. hMSCs derived from the bone marrow were efficiently engineered to express human pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) by lentiviral transduction, then tested in vitro for high-level expression and bioactivity of the transgenic protein. The preferential homing of hMSCs toward HCC was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo migration assays. in vivo efficacy experiments showed that intravenous (i.v.) injection of PEDF-expressing hMSCs significantly suppressed both the growth of primary liver tumors and the development of pulmonary metastases. Moreover, hMSCs-based PEDF gene delivery moderately increased the systemic levels of human PEDF. Immunohistochemistry of primary liver tumors demonstrated lower microvessel density in mice treated with hMSCs-PEDF than in control mice. This is the first study to show the potential of hMSCs as an effective delivery vehicle for therapeutic genes in the treatment of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2141944418,"Virtually nothing is known about the mechanisms and enzymes responsible for the glycosylation of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs). The glycosyltransferase 37 family contains plant-specific enzymes, which suggests involvement in plant-specific organs such as the cell wall. Our working hypothesis is that AtFUT4 and AtFUT6 genes encode α(1,2)fucosyltransferases (FUTs) for AGPs. Multiple lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, overexpression of the two genes in tobacco BY2 cells, known to contain nonfucosylated AGPs, resulted in a staining of transgenic cells with eel lectin, which specifically binds to terminal α-linked fucose. Second, monosaccharide analysis by high pH anion exchange chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry indicated the presence of fucose in AGPs from transgenic cell lines but not in AGPs from wild type cells. Third, detergent extracts from microsomal membranes prepared from transgenic lines were able to fucosylate, in vitro, purified AGPs from BY2 wild type cells. Susceptibility of [14C]fucosylated AGPs to α(1,2)fucosidase, and not to α(1,3/4)fucosidase, indicated that an α(1,2) linkage is formed. Furthermore, dearabinosylated AGPs were not substrate acceptors for these enzymes, indicating that arabinosyl residues represent the fucosylation sites on these molecules. Testing of several polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and glycoproteins as potential substrate acceptors in the fucosyl transfer reactions indicated that the two enzymes are specific for AGPs but are not functionally redundant because they differentially fucosylate certain AGPs.

In most cases, Fuc residues at terminal positions of the polymer are linked via α(1,2) or α(1,3) linkages. Terminal Fuc exists in a methylated form in type A side chains of RG-II; however, in type B side chains, the Fuc is internal and attached to rhamnose via an α(1,4) linkage and bears a glucuronic acid at its C-4 position (2O'Neill M. Albersheim P. Darvill A. Dey P.M. Methods in Plant Biochemistry. 2. Academic Press, London1990: 415-441Google Scholar). In animals, Fuc residues are involved in several physiological processes including fertilization, development, host-pathogen interactions, and cancer (4Bianchet M.A. Odom E.W. Vasta G.R. Amzel L.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 628-634PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hakomori S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10231-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 6Shida K. Misonou Y. Korekane H.

In plants, Fuc is important in regulating cell wall integrity and extensibility in growing tissues. For example, Fuc in XyGs terminates sugar side chains that are attached to a β(1,4)glucan backbone, which in turn binds tightly to the cellulose network of dicot primary cell walls (1Carpita N.C. Gibeaut D.M. Plant J. 1993; 3: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar). Molecular models predict that such side chains enhance the binding of XyGs to the surface of cellulose microfibrils (7Levy S. York W.S. Stuike-Prill R. Meyer B. Staehelin L.A. Plant J. 1991; 1: 195-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In addition, XyG subunits containing Fuc possess growth regulating activity (8Augur C. Yu L. Sakai K. Ogawa T. Sinaÿ P.

An Arabidopsis mutant that cannot synthesize fucosylated polymers (mur1) is brittle and shows stunted growth compared with wild type (11Reiter W.D. Chapple C.C. Somerville C.R. Science. 1993; 261: 1032-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The fact that this mutant recovers sufficiently to complete its life cycle is probably explained in part by the substitution of l-Fuc by l-galactose in XyGs (12Zablackis E. York W.S. Pauly M.

(14O'Neill M.A. Eberhard S. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G.

More recent analysis of the mur1 mutant showed that fucosylated AGPs are required for root cell elongation (15van Hengel A.J. Roberts K.

Fucosyltransferases (FUTs) catalyze the transfer of Fuc from GDP-Fuc to various substrate acceptors. They are classified into seven glycosyltransferase (GT) families in the CAZy (carbohydrate-active enzymes) database. Three of these GT families (GT11, GT23, and GT74) contain α(1,2/6)FUTs for N-glycans, whereas α(1,3/4)FUTs for N-glycans cluster together in the GT10 family. The GT65 and GT68 families contain enzymes involved in protein O-fucosylation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, whereas the GT37 family contains exclusively plant enzymes. Thus, members of the GT37 family are most likely involved in fucosylation of plant-specific organelles such as the cell wall. The Arabidopsis and rice genomes contain 10 and 17 members of GT37 family, respectively. Among these Arabidopsis genes, which are designated AtFUT1-AtFUT10, only AtFUT1 (At2g03220) has a defined function as a XyG-specific α(1,2)FUT (16Perrin R.M. DeRocher A.E. Bar-Peled M. Zeng W.

Our working hypothesis is that some GT37 family members are responsible for adding Fuc to various AGPs. AGPs are found in the cell walls, plasma membranes, and extracellular secretions of plants and are extensively glycosylated members of the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein family, which function in various aspects of plant growth and development (reviewed in Ref. 18Showalter A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1399-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Although progress in elucidating the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of several plant cell wall polysaccharides is being made, virtually nothing is known about the mechanisms and enzymes responsible for the glycosylation of AGPs (19Farrokhi N. Burton R.A. Brownfield L. Hrmova M. Wilson S.M. Bacic A. Fincher G.B. Plant Biotechnol. J. 2006; 4: 145-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Although the Golgi complex has been shown to be involved in hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein glycosylation a while ago (20Gardiner M. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 1975; 55: 536-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an arabinosyltransferase (AraT) activity for extensin was identified in particulate membranes (21Owens R.J. Northcote D.H. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), only recently was an Arabidopsis gene At2g35610 (a member of the GT77 family) for this AraT activity identified (22Gille S. Hänsel U. Ziemann M. Pauly M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14699-14704Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fuc is present in AGPs in several dicot plants such as Arabidopsis (15van Hengel A.J. Roberts K. Plant J. 2002; 32: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and radish (23Tsumuraya Y. Ogura K. Hashimoto Y. Mukoyama H. Yamamoto S. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 155-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Linkage analysis, reactivity with eel lectin, and digestion with α(1,2)fucosidase indicate that these fucosyl residues are terminal and attached, via an α-linkage, to the C-2 position of the adjacent arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residue (23Tsumuraya Y. Ogura K. Hashimoto Y. Mukoyama H. Yamamoto S. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 155-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Tsumuraya Y. Hashimoto Y. Yamamoto S. Shibuya N. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 134: 215-228Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The only report describing an α(1,2)FUT activity for AGPs came from a work on radish root, in which a Ara-α(1,3)Gal-β(1,6)Gal trisaccharide was used as exogenous substrate acceptor to mimic an arabinogalactan polysaccharide in an enzymatic assay (25Misawa H. Tsumuraya Y. Kaneko Y. Hashimoto Y. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the functional characterization of two putative AGP-α(1,2)FUTs, encoded by the AtFUT4 and AtFUT6 genes, from the GT37 family. Our results demonstrate that both enzymes can fucosylate AGPs in vivo and in vitro and are not active against other cell wall polymer substrates in vitro. These two enzymes are the first to be characterized for AGP glycosylation and further our understanding of cell wall biosynthesis. GDP-[14C]Fucose (200 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Tobacco Bright Yellow 2 (BY2) wild type cell suspension cultures and β-glucosyl Yariv reagent (2 mg/ml) in 1% (w/v) NaCl were kindly provided by Dr. Marcia Kieliszewski (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Ohio University). All of the detergents, α1-acid glycoprotein, Dowex 1-X80 resins were purchased from Sigma. Tamarind XyG, rhamnogalacturonans (from soybean and potato), and arabinan (from sugar beet) were purchased from Megazyme International (Bray, Ireland). N-Acetyllactosamine was from Fisher. PD-10 desalting columns were from GE Healthcare. Eel lectin (Anguilla anguilla) linked to the fluorescent Texas Red was from EY Laboratories Inc (San Mateo, CA). α(1,2)Fucosidase (GK80170, 400 milliunits/mg) was from Glyko (Bicester, UK), and α(1,3/4)fucosidase (E-F134, 2.3 units/mg) from almond meal was from QA-Bio, LLC (Palm Desert, CA). The Bio-gel P2 was from Bio-Rad. Full-length cDNA clones of AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 were obtained from INRA-CNRGV and the ABRC DNA Stock Center (Columbus, Ohio), respectively. For the AtFUT4.1 cDNA, an N terminus His-tagged construct was created with a PCR-based strategy using Taq DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs), a forward primer containing the His6 tag (5′-caccatgcatcatcatcatcatcacACCATCGTCTTTAGTACCTTAC-3′), and a reverse primer (5′-CTATAACTCATCAAAAAGCTTAAGC-3′). After amplification, the PCR product was cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector via a TOPO cloning reaction (Invitrogen). The final construct was sequenced twice by the Ohio University Genomics Facility for verification. The His-AtFUT4.1 construct was released from pCR4-TOPO:His-FUT4.1 by EcoRI digestion, gel-purified using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and ligated with T4 DNA ligase (New England BioLabs) into the Gateway pENTR2B vector (Invitrogen). A diagnostic digest was used to check for the correct orientation of His-FUT4.1. For expression in plants (tobacco BY2 cells), the His-FUT4.1 construct was transferred from pENTR2B to pMDC32 via an LR Clonase reaction using ApaI digestion. The pMDC32 expression vector uses a double 35S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter to drive expression and encodes kanamycin resistance in bacteria and hygromycin resistance in plants (26Curtis M.D. Grossniklaus U. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 462-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar). For the AtFUT6 cDNA, the N terminus His-tagged construct was created with a PCR-based strategy using AccuPrime Pfx Polymerase (Invitrogen), a forward primer containing the His6 tag (5′-caccatgcatcatcatcatcatcacACCATGAAGATTCTGCTAACACTA-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-CATTAACTCATCAAATAGCTT-3′). The resulting PCR product was cloned into the pENTR/d-TOPO Gateway vector (Invitrogen). The final construct was sequenced twice for verification. His-FUT6 was then transferred from pENTR/d-TOPO to pMDC32 by an LR Clonase reaction using MluI digestion. All of the plasmid constructs were transformed into DH5α Escherichia coli cells, and plasmids were purified using a QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). The pMDC32 vector containing His-AtFUT4.1 or His-AtFUT6 cDNAs was introduced into electrocompetent Agrobacterium strain EHA105 by electroporation (Bio-Rad; voltage, 2.4 kV, 200 Ω, 5-ms pulse). Electroporated cells were mixed with 1 ml of LB and incubated at 28 °C for 4 h with agitation (200rpm). Transformed EHA105 were selected on medium containing kanamycin and rifampicin for 48 h at 28 °C and confirmed by PCR. To transform BY2 cells, 100 μl of 24 h EHA105 culture grown in LB containing 200 μm acetosyringone was co-incubated with 5 ml of 4-day-old tobacco BY2 cells for 48 h at 22 °C in the dark. After washing, BY2 cells were spread over plates of NT-1 medium (4.3 g/liter of Murashige and Skoog salts, 30 g/liter of sucrose, 100 mg/liter of KH2PO4, 50 mg/liter of myo-inositol, 1 mg/liter of thiamine, and 0.22 mg/liter of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, pH 5.6) containing 0.6% Gelrite, hygromycin (20 mg/liter), and cefotaxime (250 mg/liter) for 4 weeks at 22 °C in the dark for microcalli generation. Transgenic BY2 cell suspension cultures were generated from individual transformed calli and maintained by subculturing every 3 weeks (10 ml of suspension cells into 100 ml of fresh medium supplemented with 50 mg/ml hygromycin). Wild type BY2 cells were cultured in media without antibiotic. Cloning of AtFUT6-GFP was done as described above using the following primer sequences: forward, 5′-CACCATGAAGATTCTGCTAACACTA-3′, and reverse, 5′-CATTAACTCATCAAATAGCTT-3′. The pMDC83 expression vector that encompasses the GFP gene was used. The sialyltransferase (ST)-YFP construct was a gift from Dr. Yumiko Sakuragi (Department of Plant Biology and Biotechnology, Copenhagen University, Denmark). The AtFUT6-GFP and ST-YFP genes along with P19 were co-incubated for 1 h at room temperature and co-infiltrated into leaves of N. tabacum. The epidermal cell layers were observed for fluorescence after 2 days in the dark. Fluorescence was observed using a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope. For co-localization of GFP and YFP in epidermal cells, a 488- and 514-nm argon ion laser was used. Fluorescence signals were separated using an acoustico-optical beam splitter; the emission signal was 495–510 nm for GFP and 540–580 nm for YFP. Appropriate controls were performed to exclude the possibility of cross-talk between the two fluorochromes before image acquisition. AGPs were purified by precipitation with Yariv reagent according to the procedures described in Ref. 27Schultz C.J. Johnson K.L. Currie G. Bacic A. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1751-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar. Dearabinosylation of AGPs was carried out using mild acid conditions as described in Ref. 28Kieliszewski M. de Zacks R. Leykam J.F. Lamport D.T. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar. Dearabinosylated AGPs-BY2WT were solubilized in water to a final carbohydrate concentration of 1%(w/v), before use as acceptor (100 μg) in enzyme assays. The removal of Ara residues was confirmed by monosaccharide composition analysis. Microsomal membrane preparation and enzyme solubilization were carried out essentially as described in Ref. 29Zeng W. Chatterjee M. Faik A. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 78-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. Detergent extracts were prepared using 0.5%(w/v) digitonin (Sigma), and all of the detergent extracts were adjusted to a final protein concentration of ∼2 mg/ml before use in the enzyme assay. The fucosyltransferase enzyme assay was performed essentially as described earlier (17Faik A. Bar-Peled M. DeRocher A.E. Zeng W. Perrin R.M. Wilkerson C. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15082-15089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Two α-fucosidases were used: α(1,2)fucosidase II and α(1,3/4)fucosidase from almond meal. Reactions consisted of 10 μg of AGPs (1000–4000 cpm) being incubated in the presence of ∼800 milliunits of fucosidase in the appropriate buffer (recommended by the manufacturers) for 24 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by boiling at 100 °C for 10 min, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 rpm). Supernatants were fractionated by gel filtration on a 90 × 1.5-cm Bio-gel P2 column (Bio-Rad) that was eluted by gravity with degassed water containing 0.02% sodium azide. Fractions (2.3 ml) were collected, and the [14C]radiolabel content was monitored for each fraction. Untreated reaction products were used as controls. Fucose, xylo-oligosaccharides (DP2–6), and XyG-oligosaccharides (DP7–9) were used as standards to calibrate the column. Both total acid hydrolysis and fractionation of the monosaccharides on a CarboPac PA20 column (Dionex) were carried out as described earlier in Ref. 29Zeng W. Chatterjee M. Faik A. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 78-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. The standards used are known monosaccharides treated under the same conditions. The samples were desalted and analyzed by electrospray on an Esquire 6000 mass spectrometer system (Bruker Daltonics, Fremont, CA). Freeze dried samples containing 0.1–0.5 mg of carbohydrate were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 50% isopropanol in water. The sample flow rate was 3 μl/min. The source voltage was set at 4 kV. The capillary temperature was set at 300 °C. The Cap Exit voltage was set at 350 V, and the dry gas was nitrogen (purity 99.3%). Helium was introduced into the system to an estimated pressure of 4 × 10−6 mbar to improve trap efficiency. Tobacco BY2 cells were stained with eel lectin according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, the cells were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl and 2.7 mm KCl). After incubation (∼1 × 106 BY2 cells in 1 ml of diluted eel lectin) for 5 h at room temperature (24 °C), the cells were washed and observed under a Motic BA400 EPI-Fluorescence Upright Biological Microscope using Texas Red/Cy3.5 filter set. The image was captured by Moticam 2300 software from Motic Instruments Inc. and processed by the Motic Images Plus 2.0 program (New York, NY). Our hypothesis is that AGP-FUTs should cluster in the GT37 family along with XyG-FUT (AtFUT1) because fucosyl residues in AGPs and XyGs are α(1,2)-linked and added by an inverting mechanism, consistent with the GT37 family. Additional supporting evidence comes from analysis of Arabidopsis mur1 mutant roots, which show 40% less Fuc in their AGP and 50% less reactivity with eel lectin, which recognizes specifically terminal Fuc residues, compared with wild type (15van Hengel A.J. Roberts K. Plant J. 2002; 32: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression patterns of Arabidopsis GT37 family members showed that only AtFUT1, AtFUT4, and AtFUT6 genes are highly expressed in roots (30Sarria R. Wagner T.A. O'Neill M.A. Faik A. Wilkerson C.G. Keegstra K. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, in roots, it is likely that AtFUT4 and AtFUT6 genes are responsible for AGP fucosylation, whereas the AtFUT1 gene functions in XyG fucosylation. Walls from leaves of mur1 plants have an even more drastic reduction in Fuc content (less than 2% of the wild type) (31Reiter W.D. Chapple C. Somerville C.R. Plant J. 1997; 12: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Because AtFUT4 along with AtFUT1 are the only two GT37 members highly expressed in leaves (30Sarria R. Wagner T.A. O'Neill M.A. Faik A. Wilkerson C.G. Keegstra K. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is likely that AtFUT4 is responsible for AGPs fucosylation in leaves. Taken together, these results indicate that AtFUT4 and AtFUT6 likely encode AGP-FUTs. TAIR data bases have two entries for the AtFUT4 gene, labeled AtFUT4.1 (Atg2g15390.2) and AtFUT4.2 (At2g15390.1), and one entry for AtFUT6 (At1g14080). The AtFUT4.1 has structural similarity with AtFUT6 and most other members of the GT37 family. Both AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT4.2 entries are supported by expressed sequence tags in public data bases, and translation of their DNA sequences gave proteins with a slight difference at the N terminus, but all three sequences have the canonic motifs of the GT37 family (17Faik A. Bar-Peled M. DeRocher A.E. Zeng W. Perrin R.M. Wilkerson C. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15082-15089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the AtFUT4.1 sequence. To evaluate the biochemical function of AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 in vivo, the AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 genes were expressed in tobacco BY2 cells to determine whether these cells would produce AGPs with α-linked terminal l-Fuc residues, which could be detected by eel lectin. BY2 cells were chosen as the expression system for two reasons: (i) tobacco BY2 and Arabidopsis suspension cells produce similar AGPs (32Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13156-13165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and (ii) AGPs in both BY2 and Arabidopsis suspension cells lack Fuc (32Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13156-13165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), making them ideal substrates for AGP-FUTs. Initially, 1-, 6-, and 9-day-old transgenic and wild type (WT) cells were screened by staining with eel lectin linked to a fluorescent dye (Texas Red) to determine whether they produced fucosylated polymers in their cell walls. Only transgenic cells from 6- and 9-day-old cultures showed strong staining (Fig. 1), indicating that the expression of AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 resulted in the incorporation of α-linked terminal Fuc residues onto some cell wall polymers. The 9-day-old cells expressing AtFUT4.1 had stronger red staining compared with younger cultures, whereas cells expressing AtFUT6 showed stronger staining at 6 days (Fig. 1). Both BY2 transgenic cell lines produced a single band with a size of 60 kDa compatible with the predicted sizes of the His-AtFUT4.1 (∼61kDa) and His-AtFUT6 (59kDa) proteins (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Expression of His-tagged versions of AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 proteins in tobacco BY2 cells. A, dry weight of the cells was determined after 1, 3, 6, 9, 11, and 14 days of culture to monitor growth stages of the cells. The growth was steady until 9 days of culture and then stabilized, indicating a separation of cell division stage (3–9 days) from cell elongation stage (9–14 days). B, 7- and 14-day-old cultures of BY2 WT cells or transgenic BY2 cells were screened by Western blotting using anti-His6 tag antibodies (Clontech). The cells were harvested and directly ground in liquid nitrogen before extraction with SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and then the proteins were separated on 10% gels. The protein bands detected had an estimated size of ∼60 kDa in agreement with the predicted size of AtFUT4.1 (∼61 kDa) and AtFUT6 (∼59 kDa) proteins. Marker sizes (kDa) are indicated on the left.

As expected, all of the purified AGPs contained galactose (Gal) and arabinose (Ara) as the two main monosaccharides, representing ∼50 and ∼35 mol %, respectively (Table 1). The most noticeable difference between AGPs from WT (AGPs-BY2WT) and transgenic (AGPs-BY2:F6 and AGPs-BY2:F4) cultures was the presence of Fuc (Table 1). Using HPAEC separation, Fuc was estimated to be ∼1.2 and 0.5 mol % in 7-day-old cells expressing AtFUT6 and AtFUT4.1, respectively. AGPs-BY2:F4 also showed a higher xylose content compared with AGPs-BY2WT or AGPs-BY2:F6.TABLE 1Neutral monosaccharide content of purified AGPs from transgenic tobacco BY2 cells expressing AtFUT4.1 or AtFUT6 and WT cellsBY2 WTBY2 expressing AtFUT4.1BY2 expressing AtFUT6mol %mol %mol %Galactose51 ± 247 ± 256 ± 2Arabinose36 ± 237 ± 232 ± 3Glucose13 ± 112 ± 210 ± 2Xylose0.7 ± 0.14 ± 0.50.8 ± 0.1Fucose00.5 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab ESI-MS analysis provided further confirmation of fucosylated AGPs in the transgenic cultures. Following acid hydrolysis of transgenic and WT AGPs, the released sugars were fractionated by HPAEC. Fractions eluting between 2 and 6 min, which encompasses the elution time of a Fuc standard, were collected and analyzed by ESI-MS. The ion m/z of 165 ([M+H]+), characteristic of Fuc, was detected in transgenic, but not in WT samples, indicating that both genes encode FUTs that incorporate Fuc into AGPs (Fig. 3). Next, the FUT activity of both enzymes was measured in vitro, using GDP-[14C]Fuc and digitonin (0.5%)-solubilized extracts from microsomal membranes prepared from transgenic and WT cells. Here detergent-soluble extracts from the transgenic cells were able to incorporate substantial amounts of [14C]Fuc onto AGPs-BY2WT (used as acceptors) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Detergent extracts from WT cells did not catalyze this transfer. Similarly, control reactions (GDP-[14C]Fuc in the presence of AGPs-BY2WT alone or in the presence of protein extracts alone) did not show any [14C]Fuc incorporation. These data indicate that [14C]Fuc incorporation was AGP-dependent and due to the expression of AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6. To verify that both enzymes were specific to AGPs, several molecules, known to act as substrates for FUTs or contain Fuc, were tested as acceptors: XyG, RG, N-acetyllactosamine, and glycoproteins. Two types of RGs were used; one contained Fuc (RG from soybean), and the other one did not (RG from potato). N-Acetyllactosamine and α1-acid glycoprotein were used as acceptors for α(1,3)/α(1,2)FUT activities for N-glycans, and tamarind XyG was used as an acceptor for XyG-FUT activity. The data presented in Table 2 compared [14C]Fuc incorporated onto these substrates after incubation with detergent extracts from transgenic and WT BY2 cells. As judged by the comparably low [14C]Fuc incorporation obtained for all these wall polymers, none of these polymers (except AGPs-BY2WT) served as effective substrate acceptors for AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6. These results indicate that both AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 are FUTs specific to AGPs.TABLE 2Substrate specificity of AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 enzymesAcceptor added (100 μg)Source of enzyme extractBY2 WTBY2 expressing AtFUT6BY2 expressing AtFUT4.1None2 ± 16 ± 17.5 ± 2AGPs-BY2WT12 ± 3485 ± 10210 ± 5RGI from potato80 ± 9100 ± 587 ± 6RG from soybean109 ± 594 ± 895 ± 2Arabinan67 ± 965 ± 666 ± 5Tamarind XyG49 ± 939 ± 537 ± 2N-Acetyllactosamine122 ± 10111 ± 9107 ± 5α1-acid glycoprotein4 ± 13.5 ± 13 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Interestingly, when AGPs-BY2WT were used in the FUT assay, extracts containing AtFUT4.1 were less than 50% as active compared with extracts containing AtFUT6 (Fig. 4A). This low activity of AtFUT4.1 could be attributed to low expression levels of the enzyme or to a difference in the specificity. To investigate this hypothesis, purified AGPs-BY2:F6 and AGPs-BY2:F4 were used as substrate acceptors in the presence of extracts containing AtFUT4.1 or AtFUT6 proteins. With AGPs-BY2:F6 as substrate, very low [14C]Fuc incorporation was obtained with extracts from cells expressing AtFUT6, but substantial incorporation (comparable with AGPs-BY2WT) was observed with extracts from cells expressing AtFUT4.1 (Fig. 4B). Reciprocally, purified AGPs-BY2:F4 were effective acceptors for extracts containing AtFUT6 protein (comparable with AGPs-BY2WT) but were not very effective substrates for extracts containing AtFUT4.1 protein (Fig. 4C). In addition, the level of AtFUT4.1 expression was comparable with AtFUT6 as indicated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1). These data indicate that AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 differentially fucosylate AGPs, most likely on different Ara residues on AGPs. To examine whether [14C]Fuc is transferred onto Ara branches of AGPs, purified AGPs-BY2WT were treated with mild acid treatment at 100 °C to remove Ara residues (28Kieliszewski M. de Zacks R. Leykam J.F. Lamport D.T. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and used as acceptors. The efficiency of the acid treatment was assessed by the change in the ratio of Gal to Ara in untreated and dearabinosylated AGPs from 1.7:1 to 30:1, respectively (data not shown). When used as acceptors with extracts containing AFUT4.1 or AtFUT6, [14C]Fuc incorporation was minimal and similar to negative control reactions lacking these FUTs or an extract. In contrast, untreated AGPs-BY2WT (positive controls) were good acceptors (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate that fucosylation sites reside on Ara residues of AGPs. The linkage between Fuc and Ara was further characterized using two α-fucosidases, namely α-fucosidase II that removes terminal Fuc residues specifically α-linked to the C-2 position of the adjacent sugar and an α-fucosidase from almond meal that removes terminal Fuc residues specifically α-linked to the C-3 or C-4 positions of the adjacent sugar. When the [14C]fucosylated AGPs-BY2WT generated by AtFUT6 extracts were treated with α-fucosidase II and fractionated on a Biogel P2 column, more than 60% of the radiolabel was released at the total volume as a DP1 sugar (Fig. 6). The identity of this released sugar was confirmed as [14C]Fuc by HPAEC. However, similar experiments using α-fucosidase from almond meal did not release [14C]Fuc (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained using [14C]fucosylated AGPs-BY2WT generated by AtFUT4.1 extracts (Fig. 6). Taken together with the dearabinoslylation data, these results indicated that AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 incorporate terminal α-l-Fuc residues on the C-2 positions of adjacent Ara residues of AGPs. To investigate whether AtFUT6 is localized in the Golgi, AtFUT6-green fluorescent protein (AtFUT6-GFP) fusion protein was constructed and transiently co-expressed with a Golgi marker protein, α(2,6)sialyltransferase (33Saint-Jore C.M. Evins J. Batoko H. Brandizzi F. Moore I. Hawes C. Plant J. 2002; 29: 661-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), fused to yellow fluorescent protein (ST-YFP) in tobacco leaves. AtFUT6-GFP was observed in punctate structures typical of a Golgi-localized staining pattern (Fig. 7a). The same staining pattern was also obtained with ST-YFP (Fig. 7b), and both staining patterns overlapped (Fig. 7c), consistent with the likely Golgi localization of AtFUT6 protein. Because of technical issues, we did not succeed in determining localization of AtFUT4.1. Despite the fact that plants contain substantial amounts of AGPs, there is an embarrassing lack of knowledge on the enzymology of AGP biosynthesis, and none of the biosynthetic enzymes have been cloned. In the present work, we describe the characterization of the biochemical function of two Arabidopsis genes, AtFUT4 and AtFUT6, as α(1,2)FUTs specific for AGPs. These two genes along with eight others are members of the GT37 family. The only GT37 member fully characterized previously is the XyG-specific α(1,2)FUT encoded by the AtFUT1 gene (16Perrin R.M.

Using a multifaceted strategy, we demonstrated that both AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 specifically fucosylate AGPs via an α(1,2) linkage onto Ara residues. In addition, our localization study supported earlier work (20Gardiner M. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 1975; 55: 536-541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Owens R.J. Northcote D.H. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) on the role of the Golgi apparatus in the glycosylation of hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins. The in vitro FUT assay also revealed that the two FUT genes are not functionally redundant. Because AtFUT4.1 could fucosylate AGPs-BY2:F6, and AtFUT6 could fucosylate AGPs-BY:F4 and neither of the enzymes could use AGPs from their own cells (Fig. 4), we propose that the two enzymes transfer Fuc residues onto two different Ara residues on AGP molecules (enzyme specificity dictated by the fucosylation sites). Tan et al. (32Tan L. Qiu F. Lamport D.T. Kieliszewski M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13156-13165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) have shown that the expression of a synthetic gene encoding an [Ala-Hyp]51 peptide in tobacco BY2 cells produced and secreted a mixture of glycoproteins having Hyp residues substituted with arabinogalactan (AG) polysaccharides (DP13–26) and containing terminal Ara residues α(1,3)- or α(1,5)-linked. A simplified presentation of this AG polysaccharide structure is depicted in Fig. 5A; this figure shows that AGs can contain up to five Ara residues as side chains that could be potential sites for fucosylation. Thus, AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 likely specify FUT activities that transfer Fuc onto different Ara residues in these side chains. The difference in the enzyme activity between AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 could be explained by the difference in the amounts of AGPs with various Ara side chains. Because of the difference in eel lectin staining patterns of transgenic cells (Fig. 1), it is tempting to speculate that the substrate acceptors for AtFUT4.1 and AtFUT6 have subtle differences in their AG polymers, as a result of the action of AraTs. For example, the expression of various α(1.3)- or α(1,5)-AraT genes during BY2 cell growth could generate different fucosylation sites (i.e. substrates) for AGP-FUTs. The GT77 family contains at least three putative AraTs (22Gille S. Hänsel U. Ziemann M. Pauly M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biol. 2007; 64: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and may also contain AraT for AGPs. Misawa et al. (25Misawa H. Tsumuraya Y. Kaneko Y. Hashimoto Y. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have used a trisaccharide with terminal Araf residues α(1,3)-linked to Gal as an exogenous acceptor for radish AGP-FUT. One of the Arabidopsis AGP-FUT proteins described here could have this activity, and the other AtFUT protein might be specific to a terminal Araf α(1,5)-linked to an Araf or to any internal Araf in the side chains. Verification of this hypothesis is needed when purified acceptors are available. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that the AtFUT4 and AtFUT6 genes encode α(1,2)FUTs specific for AGPs. Furthermore, our data indicate that these two AGP-AtFUTs are not functionally redundant on a biochemical level and thus may have different physiological roles. The present study has increased our understanding of the AGP biosynthesis, specifically with respect to glycosylation. Identification of these genes also opens new avenues to examine other AGP glycosyltransferases that may be in complexes with these FUTs and to probe AGP function. Indeed, analysis of Arabidopsis mutants for these two genes should help to elucidate AGP function and the contribution of specific carbohydrate epitopes to cell wall integrity and plant growth."

On the other hand, mutation of p53 is associated with advanced prostate cancer, as well as with metastasis and hormone independence. This study shows that in prostate cell lines in culture, Egr-1 overexpression correlated with an alteration of p53 activity because of the expression of SV40 large T-antigen or because of a mutation in the TP53 gene. In cells containing altered p53 activity, Egr-1 expression was abolished by pharmacological inhibition or RNAi silencing of p53. Although forced expression of wild-type p53 was not sufficient to trigger Egr-1 transcription, four different mutants of p53 were shown to induce Egr-1. Direct binding of p53 to the EGR1 promoter could not be detected. Instead, Egr-1 transcription was driven by the ERK1/2 pathway, as it was abrogated by specific inhibitors of MEK. Egr-1 increased the transcription of HB-EGF (epidermal growth factor), amphiregulin and epiregulin, resulting in autocrine activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and downstream MEK/ERK cascade. Thus, mutant p53 initiates a feedback loop that involves ERK1/2-mediated transactivation of Egr-1, which in turn increases the secretion of EGFR ligands and stimulates the EGFR signaling pathway. Finally, p53 may further regulate this feedback loop by altering the level of EGFR expression."

The entire gene cluster for biosynthesis of FK520 from Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. ascomyceticus has been cloned and sequenced. On the other hand, the FK506 gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. MA6548 (ATCC55098) was sequenced only partially, and it was reasonable to expect that additional genes would be required for the provision of substrate supply. Here we report the identification of a previously unknown region of the FK506 gene cluster from Streptomyces tsukubaensis NRRL 18488 containing genes encoding the provision of unusual building blocks for FK506 biosynthesis as well as a regulatory gene. Among others, we identified a group of genes encoding biosynthesis of the extender unit that forms the allyl group at carbon 21 of FK506. Interestingly, we have identified a small independent diketide synthase system involved in the biosynthesis of the allyl group. Inactivation of one of these genes, encoding an unusual ketosynthase domain, resulted in an FK506 nonproducing strain, and the production was restored when a synthetic analog of the allylmalonyl-CoA extender unit was added to the cultivation medium. Based on our results, we propose a biosynthetic pathway for the provision of an unusual five-carbon extender unit, which is carried out by a novel diketide synthase complex."

Δ133p53 is expressed from a specific mRNA, p53I4, driven by an alternative promoter P2 located between intron 1 and exon 5 of TP53 gene. Here, we report that the P2 promoter is regulated in a p53-dependent manner. Δ133p53 expression is increased in response to DNA damage by doxorubicin in p53 wild-type cell lines, but not in p53-mutated cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays using P2 promoter deletion constructs indicate that p53 binds functional response elements located within the P2 promoter. We also show that Δ133p53 does not bind specifically to p53 consensus DNA sequence in vitro, but competes with wild-type p53 in specific DNA-binding assays. Finally, we report that Δ133p53 counteracts p53-dependent growth suppression in clonogenic assays. These observations indicate that Δ133p53 is a novel target of p53 that may participate in a negative feedback loop controlling p53 function."

In this study, we extended the role of L11 to the regulation of c-Myc-driven transcription of the 5 S rRNA and tRNA genes by RNA polymerase III. L11 co-resided with c-Myc at the 5 S rRNA and tRNA genes and significantly inhibited the binding of TRRAP to these genes.

https://openalex.org/W2092764069,"The epitope of the 3F4 antibody most commonly used in human prion disease diagnosis is believed to consist of residues Met-Lys-His-Met (MKHM) corresponding to human PrP-(109-112). This assumption is based mainly on the observation that 3F4 reacts with human and hamster PrP but not with PrP from mouse, sheep, and cervids, in which Met at residue 112 is replaced by Val. Here we report that, by brain histoblotting, 3F4 did not react with PrP of uninfected transgenic mice expressing elk PrP; however, it did show distinct immunoreactivity in transgenic mice infected with chronic wasting disease. Compared with human PrP, the 3F4 reactivity with the recombinant elk PrP was 2 orders of magnitude weaker, as indicated by both Western blotting and surface plasmon resonance. To investigate the molecular basis of these species- and conformer-dependent preferences of 3F4, the epitope was probed by peptide membrane array and antigen competition experiments. Remarkably, the 3F4 antibody did not react with MKHM but reacted strongly with KTNMK (corresponding to human PrP-(106-110)), a sequence that is also present in cervids, sheep, and cattle. 3F4 also reacted with elk PrP peptides containing KTNMKHV. We concluded that the minimal sequence for the 3F4 epitope consists of residues KTNMK, and the species- and conformer-dependent preferences of 3F4 arise largely from the interactions between Met(112) (human PrP) or Val(115) (cervid PrP) and adjacent residues."

https://openalex.org/W2073252832,"Many different types of cancer originate from aberrant signaling from the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), arising through different translocation events and overexpression. Further, activating point mutations in the ALK domain have been recently reported in neuroblastoma. To characterize signaling in the context of the full-length receptor, we have examined whether ALK is able to activate Rap1 and contribute to differentiation/proliferation processes. We show that ALK activates Rap1 via the Rap1-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor C3G, which binds in a constitutive complex with CrkL to activated ALK. The activation of the C3G/Rap1 pathway results in neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, which is inhibited by either overexpression of Rap1GAP or siRNA-mediated knockdown of Rap1 itself or the guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G. Significantly, this pathway also appears to function in the regulation of proliferation of neuroblastoma cells such as SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y, because abrogation of Rap1 activity by Rap1-specific siRNA or overexpression of Rap1GAP reduces cellular growth. These results suggest that ALK activation of Rap1 may contribute to cell proliferation and oncogenesis of neuroblastoma driven by gain-of-function mutant ALK receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1975283479,"TEA domain transcription factor-1 (TEAD-1) is essential for proper heart development and is implicated in cardiac specific gene expression and the hypertrophic response of primary cardiomyocytes to hormonal and mechanical stimuli, and its activity increases in the pressure-overloaded hypertrophied rat heart. To investigate whether TEAD-1 is an in vivo modulator of cardiac specific gene expression and hypertrophy, we developed transgenic mice expressing hemagglutinin-tagged TEAD-1 under the control of the muscle creatine kinase promoter. We show that a sustained increase in TEAD-1 protein leads to an age-dependent dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed decreases in cardiac output, stroke volume, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening. Isolated TEAD-1 hearts revealed decreased left ventricular power output that correlated with increased betaMyHC protein. Histological analysis showed altered alignment of cardiomyocytes, septal wall thickening, and fibrosis, although electrocardiography displayed a left axis shift of mean electrical axis. Transcripts representing most members of the fetal heart gene program remained elevated from fetal to adult life. Western blot analyses revealed decreases in p-phospholamban, SERCA2a, p-CX43, p-GSK-3alpha/beta, nuclear beta-catenin, GATA4, NFATc3/c4, and increased NCX1, nuclear DYKR1A, and Pur alpha/beta protein. TEAD-1 mice did not display cardiac hypertrophy. TEAD-1 mice do not tolerate stress as they die over a 4-day period after surgical induction of pressure overload. These data provide the first in vivo evidence that increased TEAD-1 can induce characteristics of cardiac remodeling associated with cardiomyopathy and heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2083397169,"The p53 tumor suppressor protein is widely known for its role as a sequence-specific transcription factor that regulates the expression of stress response genes. Here, we report the identification of LIMK2, which encodes a kinase that regulates actin dynamics through phosphorylation of cofilin, as a p53 target upregulated by DNA damage. Interestingly, the splice variant LIMK2b, but not LIMK2a, was induced in a p53-dependent manner through an intronic consensus p53-binding site. Depletion of LIMK2b leads to early exit of G2/M arrest after DNA damage, whereas its overexpression prolongs the arrest. These responses are recapitulated by ectopic expression of the active cofilin S3A mutant and the inactive cofilin S3D mutant, respectively, suggesting that LIMK2b may modulate G2/M arrest through cofilin phosphorylation. Furthermore, in support of its potential role as a tumor suppressor, LIMK2b was downregulated in esophageal and thyroid cancers, as well as in a number of established cancer cell lines, and its expression suppresses cancer cell migration. Taken together, our results unveil a novel pathway whereby LIMK2b, acting downstream of p53, ensures proper execution of checkpoint arrest by modulating the dynamics of actin polymerization."

https://openalex.org/W2033820909,"T cells form an immunological synapse (IS) that sustains and regulates signals for cell stimulation. Enriched in the IS is the Src family kinase Lck. Conversely, the membrane phosphatase CD45, which activates Src family kinases, is excluded, and this is necessary to avoid quenching of T cell receptor phosphosignals. Data suggest that this arrangement occurs by an enrichment of cholesterol-dependent rafts in the IS. However, the role of rafts in structuring the IS remains unclear. To address this question, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to interrogate the nanoscopic structure of the IS. The FRET probes consisted of membrane-anchored fluorescent proteins with distinct affinities for rafts. Both the raft and nonraft probes exhibited clustering in the IS. However, co-clustering of raft donor-acceptor pairs was 10-fold greater than co-clustering of raft-nonraft pairs. We measured the effect of disrupting rafts in the IS on CD45 localization and Lck regulation by treating stimulated T cells with filipin. The filipin specifically disrupted co-clustering of the raft FRET pairs in the IS and allowed targeting of CD45 to the IS and dephosphorylation of the regulatory tyrosine of Lck. Clustering of the raft probes was also sensitive to latrunctulin B, which disrupts actin filaments. Strikingly, enriching the cortical cytoskeleton using jasplakinolide maintained raft probe co-clustering, CD45 exclusion, and Lck regulation in the IS following the addition of filipin.

The IS has a distinct architecture, in many cases represented by a central supramolecular activation complex (c-SMAC) that is surrounded by a peripheral supramolecular activation complex (p-SMAC) (8Monks C.R.

Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2563) Google Scholar). Concentrated in the c-SMAC are the TCR and membrane signaling molecules that function spatially and temporally proximal to the TCR. One such TCR-proximal effector is the Src family kinase Lck (8Monks C.R. Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Sciaky N. Kupfer A. Nature. 1998; 395: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar, 9Grakoui A.

The p-SMAC is enriched with adhesion molecules, such as the integrin LFA-1. Outside of the p-SMAC is the protein-tyrosine phosphatase CD45, which activates Lck and other Src family kinases by dephosphorylating their C-terminal regulatory tyrosine (10Ostergaard H.L. Shackelford D.A. Hurley T.R. Johnson P. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 8959-8963Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 11Mustelin T.

As a potent phosphatase, segregation of CD45 from the c-SMAC is necessary to avoid quenching of phosphotyrosine signals at the TCR complex (15Johnson K.G. Bromley S.K. Dustin M.L. Thomas M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10138-10143Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 16Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Maslanik W. Delli J. Kappler J. Zaller D.M. Kupfer A. Nat.

One model relates to the cholesterol-dependent membrane rafts. Rafts are posited to be discrete membrane domains that are composed of proteins and lipids that occur in a detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) fraction present in cell lysates (17Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Data that show a discrete and cholesterol-dependent clustering of DRM-associated molecules (18Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V.

Many of the proteins and lipids enriched in the IS also occur in DRMs (25Villalba M. Bi K. Rodriguez F. Tanaka Y. Schoenberger S. Altman A. J.

EMBO J. 2009; 28: 466-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), suggesting that the IS represents a specialized raft compartment in the plasma membrane (29Rodgers W. Farris D. Mishra S. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 97-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Similarly, CD45 is largely excluded from DRMs (30Rodgers W. Rose J.K. J.

Although the IS has a protein and lipid composition that is consistent with it being a raft-enriched compartment, other data contrast with this model. Examples include protein localization in the IS despite a low affinity for DRMs (33Glebov O.O. Nichols B.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 34Hundt M. Harada Y. De Giorgio L. Tanimura N. Zhang W. Altman A. J.

Cell. 2005; 121: 937-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Protein size is also an important determinant for localization in the IS (36Lin J. Weiss A. J.

Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 34414-34422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the “kinetic segregation model” hypothesizes that the composition of the IS is established by whether the ectodomain of proteins fit into the space between the T cell and APC (39Davis S.J. van der Merwe P.A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). CD45 is predicted to belong to the category of proteins that are too large for the intercellular space. Although the membrane raft and kinetic segregation models are not mutually exclusive, the relative contribution of each in protein targeting to the IS for T cell activation is not clear. Much of the uncertainty regarding the mechanisms that define IS macrostructure, such as CD45 exclusion, relate to a poor understanding of its plasma membrane nanostructure. This is especially a shortcoming in models relating to rafts because most occur as nanoscale domains (20Sharma P. Varma R. Sarasij R.C. Ira Gousset K. Krishnamoorthy G. Rao M. Mayor S. Cell. 2004; 116: 577-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 24Eggeling C. Ringemann C. Medda R. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Polyakova S. Belov V.N.

Measurement of FRET between membrane-associated proteins labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophores is one method to detect nanoscale interactions influenced by membrane heterogeneities, such as rafts. FRET measurements of labeled DRM markers show nanoscale clustering of DRM-resident proteins and lipids (19Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 23Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y.

J. 2007; 92: 3564-3574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We recently showed using FRET a specific co-clustering of DRM-associated probes in the plasma membrane that was sensitive to compounds that either sequester cholesterol or alter the cortical actin cytoskeleton (43Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Conditions that disrupted DRM-associated probe clustering resulted in deregulation of Lck by dephosphorylation of its Tyr505. These data suggest that rafts are structured by actin filaments that attach to the plasma membrane, producing domains that function in Lck regulation (43Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 2319-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The IS is enriched with F-actin, but whether the cytoskeleton structures rafts in the IS for Lck regulation has not been shown. We report experiments that show nanoscopic clustering of membrane reporters in the IS by measuring FRET between membrane-anchored fluorescent proteins (FPs). We include in our measurements ISs treated to disrupt cholesterol- and cytoskeleton-dependent properties. We relate the effect of these treatments on IS nanostructure to the biological properties of the IS by measuring the localization of CD45 and its substrate, Lck Tyr(P)505. We report findings that show exclusion of CD45 from the IS that occurs by structuring of rafts at the cell interface. We show that these properties are necessary for maintaining regulation of Lck in the IS. Jurkat T cells (clone E6-1) and Raji B cells were maintained in medium containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. Expression vectors encoding CFP and YFP fusion proteins containing either the first 10 amino acids of Lck (L10), the first 15 residues of Src (S15), or the first 36 residues of linker for activation of T cells (LAT36) have been described (22Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36682-36691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Cherry-labeled actin in pEF6 vector was provided by Dr. David Knecht (University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT). For gene expression, cells were transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad). 48 h post-transfection, viable cells were separated using CellgroTM (MediaTech, Inc., Herndon, VA). Stable clones expressing CFP fusion proteins were selected by limiting dilution in media containing G418 (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. Following drug selection, the clones were enriched for protein expression by flow-assisted cell sorting and maintained in medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. Jurkat T cells were stimulated with Raji B cells pulsed with staphylococcal enterotoxin E (SEE) (Toxin Technology, Sarasota, FL). The B cells were loaded with SEE by incubating (2 × 106 cells in 0.5 ml) for 2 h at 37 °C in RPMI growth medium containing 5 μg/ml SEE. Pulsed Raji cells were mixed with Jurkat T cells at a 2:1 ratio, sedimented by centrifuging (Eppendorf) for 2 min at 1500 rpm, and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Following conjugation, the samples were seeded onto poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated coverslips and fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde. For the drug treatments, conjugates were first seeded onto coverslips, washed with RPMI containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) (RPMI-HEPES), and then incubated in RPMI-HEPES containing either 5 μm latrunctulin B (Lat B) (Calbiochem), 0.5 μm jasplakinolide (Invitrogen), or 5 μg/ml filipin (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI). Samples treated with media containing vehicle alone served as a control. All incubations were for 30 min at 37 °C. Fixed cell conjugates were immunostained using primary antibodies and Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies. For experiments including staining of intracellular proteins, the fixed samples were permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Lck Tyr505 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and PKC-θ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were stained with rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Lck, CD3ϵ (UCH-T1), and CD45 (HI30) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) were stained using mouse monoclonal antibodies. T cells were labeled with Laurdan (6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonaphtalene, Invitrogen) by incubating 2 × 106 cells for 45 min at 37 °C in 0.5 ml of RPMI-HEPES containing 5 μm Laurdan. Raji B cells were labeled with CellTrackerTM Orange CMTMR ((5-(and-6)-(((4-chloromethyl)benzoyl)amino)tetramethylrhodamine)) in RPMI-HEPES for 15 min at 37 °C containing 4 μm dye. Labeling with Laurdan and CellTrackerTM Orange CMTMR were performed before cell conjugation. Fluorescent protein imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation imaging core facility). CFP was excited at 458 nm, and emission was detected between 473 and 505 nm. YFP was excited at 514 nm, and emission was detected from 530 to 600 nm. Images were collected using a ×63 objective (numerical aperture 1.2), and recorded in 12-bit mode at a scan rate of 2.56 μs/pixel. Laurdan and CellTrackerTM Orange CMTMR imaging was performed using a Leica SP2 multiphoton microscope equipped with a ×63 Plan APO 1.4 numerical aperture objective. Laurdan fluorescence was excited using an 800-nm laser line. Laurdan fluorescence was imaged using 400–460-nm and 470–530-nm bandwidths. To image CellTrackerTM Orange CMTMR, the samples were excited at 543 nm and detected at 550–620 nm. All image processing and quantitation was performed using iVision 4.0 image analysis software (Bio Vision). FRET measurements were performed by acceptor photobleaching as we have described (22Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36682-36691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, YFP was photobleached in a 8 × 5-pixel (2.1 × 1.3-μm) region of interest (ROI) in the plasma membrane using a 514-nm laser line at full power. Prebleach (pre) and post-bleach (post) images were recorded for both CFP and YFP channels. Cells expressing CFP alone were taken through all of the steps of FRET measurement to correct for bleaching of CFP during YFP bleaching (CFPYFP bleach). A correction factor for YFP bleed-through to the CFP channel (CFPYFP bleedthrough) was generated using cells expressing YFP alone and imaged in the CFP channel. Fluorescence intensities of each ROI were measured on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and measurement of YFPpre − YFPpost showed that the photobleaching extinguished >95% of the YFP fluorescence. Consistent with recent findings, photobleaching of cells expressing YFP alone failed to show any photoconversion of YFP to a CFP-like species (44Thaler C. Vogel S.S. Ikeda S.R. Chen H. Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 491Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). CFPpre was corrected for YFP bleed-through into the CFP channel using the following operation,CFPpre,corrected=CFPpre−CFPYFP bleedthrough(Eq. 1) CFPpostbleach was corrected for both bleaching of CFP during YFP bleaching and YFP bleed-through by the following,CFPpost,corrected=(CFPpost−CFPYFP bleedthrough)+CFPYFP bleach(Eq. 2) FRET efficiency (E%) was calculated using Equation 3.E%=(CFPpost, corrected−CFPpre, corrected)CFPpost, corrected×100(Eq. 3) FRET was measured in 75–100 separate conjugates for each sample. Measurements were restricted to cells where the donor/acceptor ratio was ∼1.0, calculated using the ratio YFPpre/CFPpost, corrected. Co-clustering was measured by fitting plots of E% versus acceptor intensity to the following isothermal binding equation (23Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar),E%=E%maxF(F+K)(Eq. 4) where F represents the fluorescence intensity of the acceptor, which we defined as the prebleach intensity of the YFP fluorescence. Curve fitting and all statistical analysis were performed using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), and error analysis shows this to produce unique values for K from combined sets of FRET data (22Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36682-36691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The statistical significance of differences in K values was determined using a two-tailed Student's t test for distributions of unequal variance as described previously (22Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36682-36691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).

Measurement of relative fluorescence enrichment of proteins in the IS was performed by first identifying T cell-B cell conjugates using a differential interference contrast (DIC) image of each field. The IS was defined as the interface between the Jurkat T cell and SEE-pulsed Raji B cell. Thus, following background subtraction, T cell plasma membrane in the contact site and plasma membrane outside of the contact site were outlined separately, and the average fluorescence intensity of each region was measured. The relative fluorescence enrichment at the contact site was calculated by taking the ratio of average fluorescence intensity at the contact site over the average fluorescence intensity of the remaining plasma membrane. Generalized polarization (GP) of Laurdan was calculated using the following equation (45Dietrich C. Bagatolli L.A. Volovyk Z.N. Thompson N.L. Levi M. Jacobson K. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1417-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar),GP=I(400−460)−G×I(470−530)I(400−460)−G×I(470−530)(Eq. 5) where G represents a correction factor for the experimental setup. The G-factor was calculated as described (46Gaus K. Zech T. Harder T. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2006; 23: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) using a standard solution of 0.5 μm Laurdan in DMSO. Jurkat-SEE-pulsed Raji cell conjugates were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. Cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm cacodylate buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with cacodylate buffer, cells were stained with saturated uranyl acetate for 1 h followed by osmium tetroxide for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were embedded in resin, and ultrathin sections were cut using an ultramicrotome (Reichert UltracutE). The sections were imaged by transmission electron microscopy (Hitachi H-7600). Samples were initially screened at ×3000 magnification, and digital images (2000 × 2000 pixels) were captured using an in-line digital camera (Eastman Kodak Co.) at ×35,000 magnification. Intercellular distance measurements of the acquired images were performed using iVision 4.0 image analysis software. Intermembrane distances were measured in regions where membranes were aligned parallel to each other. For each synapse, measurements were taken from more than 15 locations at the cell interface. We illustrate in Fig. 1A the membrane-anchored FPs that we used for labeling the raft and nonraft fractions of the plasma membrane. In brief, CFP, GFP, and YFP were targeted to the plasma membrane by either the N-terminal 10 residues of Lck (L10), the N-terminal 15 residues of Src (S15), or the N-terminal 36 residues of linker for activation of T cells (LAT36). The L10 and LAT36 sequences target the FPs to rafts, represented by enrichment in DRMs and a cholesterol-dependent co-clustering in the plasma membrane (22Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36682-36691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 47Rodgers W. Crise B. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). In contrast, the S15 sequence restricts FPs to the nonraft, detergent-soluble membrane fraction; S15-anchored FPs exhibit a cholesterol-independent co-clustering that is weaker than that between the raft-associated probes (22Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36682-36691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To study the properties of the membrane-anchored FPs in the IS, we stimulated labeled Jurkat T cells with SEE pulsed Raji B cells. Fig. 1, B and C, show confocal images of labeled conjugates and, in Fig. 1D, are the relative fluorescence enrichment (Rel. Fluor. Enrich.) values that we measured for each label in the IS of many conjugates. The enrichment values were calculated by dividing the average fluorescence intensity of the plasma membrane at the cell interface by the average intensity of the remaining plasma membrane. Because CD45 is excluded from the IS (16Freiberg B.A. Kupfer H. Maslanik W. Delli J. Kappler J. Zaller D.M. Kupfer A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), we controlled for the specificity of the IS labeling by immunostaining conjugates with antibody to CD45. These data show that the stimulation produced an IS marked by an enrichment of Cherry-labeled actin and the raft probes L10-GFP and LAT36-YFP. Nonraft S15-YFP was present in the IS but not enriched. Accordingly, the average relative fluorescence enrichment value for S15-YFP was ∼1.0, significantly greater than that determined for CD45 (Fig. 1D). The distinct properties of S15-FP and CD45 in the IS suggest that factors other than restriction from rafts contribute to protein exclusion from the IS. We next measured the co-clustering of the membrane-anchored FPs in the IS by imaging FRET between the CFP- and YFP-labeled forms of L10, LAT36, and S15. We measured FRET as described (see “Experimental Procedures”) by determining the increase in donor (CFP) fluorescence following photobleaching of the acceptor (YFP) in fixed cells. We previously showed, using control CFP-YFP fusion proteins, that the increase in CFP fluorescence by YFP photobleaching is specific to FRET (22Chichili G.R. Rodgers W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36682-36691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Co-clustering of the probes was quantitated by fitting E% values to Equation 4 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to resolve the parameter K. K is analogous to the dissociation constant of the donor and acceptor, and stronger associations between the FRET pair are reflected by smaller values for K (23Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we and others previously showed that DRM-associated donor-acceptor pairs exhibit a specific and cholesterol-dependent co-clustering in the plasma membrane (22Chichili G.R.

Biosynthesis of Tetrapyrroles. Elsevier, Amsterdam1991Google Scholar). In nonplant eukaryotes and the α-subclass of purple bacteria, the production of ALA is catalyzed by the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) (EC 2.3.1.37), in a reaction involving the Claisen-like condensation of succinyl-coenzyme-A and glycine to yield CoA, carbon dioxide, and ALA (2Lendrihas T. Zhang J. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 1847-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ALAS catalyzes the first committed step of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in these organisms, which is also the rate-determining step of the pathway. Consequently, overexpression of ALAS in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells results in accumulation of the photosensitizing heme precursor protoporphyrin IX (3Whatley S.D. Ducamp S. Gouya L. Grandchamp B. Beaumont C. Badminton M.N. Elder G.H. Holme S.A. Anstey A.V. Parker M. Corrigall A.V. Meissner P.N. Hift R.J. Marsden J.T. Ma Y. Mieli-Vergani G. Deybach J.C. Puy H. Am. J. Hum.

This property could potentially lead to novel applications of ALAS or ALAS variants in photodynamic therapy of tumors and other dysplasias (4Gagnebin J. Brunori M. Otter M. Juillerat-Jeanneret L. Monnier P. Iggo R. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).ALAS is classified as a fold-type I PLP-dependent enzyme and, like the evolutionarily related l-amino acid transaminases (5Eliot A.C. Kirsch J.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), functions as a homodimer wherein a PLP cofactor is bound at each of the two active sites, which are recessed in clefts at the subunit interface (6Astner I.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8934-8941Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal structures of ALAS from Rhodobacter capsulatus and the closely related enzyme 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase from Escherichia coli reveal an induced fit type mechanism wherein binding of substrates and product, respectively, trigger closure of an extended loop over the active site (6Astner I.

Sawyer L. Baxter R.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 516-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The inferred conformational dynamics of this loop are of interest because kinetic and crystallographic studies support the hypothesis that the rate of ALA (and hence protoporphyrin IX) production is controlled by opening of the active site loop coincident with product release (6Astner I.

Chem. 2007; 282: 23025-23035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This mechanism, if correct, is notable in that the catalytic rate, which is 0.66/s at 37 °C, is slow in comparison with similar conformational motions measured in other enzymes (11Benkovic S.J. Hammes-Schiffer S. Science. 2003; 301: 1196-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), suggesting that the primary selective pressures for ALAS evolution are oriented away from speed.We posited that if loop dynamics were a primary determinant of the slow catalytic rate, then it should be straightforward to generate hyperactive ALAS variants by targeting nonconserved residues in the active site loop. Besides shedding light on the mechanism of ALA production, hyperactive ALASs might also find philanthropic utility in the generation of ALA for a variety of clinical and agricultural applications (4Gagnebin J. Brunori M. Otter M. Juillerat-Jeanneret L. Monnier P. Iggo R. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1742-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Sasaki K. Watanabe M. Tanaka T. Tanaka T. Appl. Microbiol.

To test our hypothesis, we employed synthetic mixed base oligonucleotides to generate a library of ALAS loop variants, coupled with a simple screening strategy to isolate potentially hyperactive clones.DISCUSSIONA growing body of experimental evidence supports the theory that enzyme dynamics are not only integral to but also often synchronous with key kinetic steps during biocatalysis (28Eisenmesser E.Z. Millet O. Labeikovsky W. Korzhnev D.M. Wolf-Watz M. Bosco D.A. Skalicky J.J. Kay L.E. Kern D. Nature. 2005; 438: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 29Benkovic S.J. Hammes G.G. Hammes-Schiffer S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Product release is rate-determining for many enzymatic reactions, and in several cases where this step has been more closely examined, a conformational change of the enzyme has been discovered to be the key kinetic barrier (30Hanson J.A. Duderstadt K. Watkins L.P. Bhattacharyya S. Brokaw J. Chu J.W. Yang H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18055-18060Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 31Rozovsky S. McDermott A.E. J.

Freeman M.F. Townsend C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If this reaction mechanism were true for ALAS, it should be possible to increase the relatively slow rate of reaction by targeting noncatalytic residues in the conformationally mobile active site loop region.Screening a small subset of the active site loop library resulted in isolation of nine different hyperactive ALASs. Turnover numbers and catalytic efficiencies were increased for each of the purified variant enzymes (Table 2). The catalytic efficiencies for succinyl-CoA were enhanced to a greater extent than those for glycine, consistent with the role of the active site loop in binding this substrate. The variety of sequence alterations leading to hyperactivity suggests that ALAS is not evolving toward catalytic perfection and probably has evolved toward a highly controlled rate of ALA production consistent with its role in the control of porphyrin biosynthesis. It also suggests the possibility of one or more as yet undiscovered allosteric effectors or post-translational modifications that modulate ALAS activity in vivo.The accelerations observed for the presteady state rates associated with intermediate decarboxylation (quinonoid intermediate formation) and protonation of the ALA bound quinonoid intermediate (first step of quinonoid intermediate decay) indicate that nonconserved loop residues can have effects not only on the rate of product release but also on multiple chemical steps in the catalytic cycle. It is thus reasonable to posit that loop dynamics are attuned with multiple steps in the reaction cycle.The most logical interpretation of the absence of a second step of quinonoid intermediate decay in the reactions of the SS2, H1, and F1 variants is that this step has become faster than the first step of quinonoid intermediate decay and is thus kinetically insignificant. This would imply a fundamental change in the nature of the rate-determining step of the reaction cycle in these variants, such that opening of the active site loop coincident with ALA release is no longer the slowest step. The steady state temperature dependence studies with the SS2 variant support this conclusion, because the Q10 for the catalytic rate constant is reduced from seven to two. From the single turnover rates it can be inferred that in the SS2 variant-catalyzed reaction product release has been accelerated by at least 170-fold (Qd2SS2 must be ≥Qd1SS2, which is in turn 170-fold greater than Qd2wt).The nature of the amino acid changes observed in the isolated hyperactive variants can in most cases be logically interpreted in terms of enzyme structure and function. For instance, a previous study found that the kcat value increased 20 and 100% for the R433L and R433K mALAS-2 variants, respectively (34Tan D. Harrison T. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The R. capsulatus crystal structures subsequently revealed that this loop residue comes within bifurcated hydrogen bonding distance of a conserved acidic residue (Asp81 in mALAS-2) in the closed conformation. Disruption of this electrostatic interaction would be expected to destabilize the closed conformation and provide a rationale for the observed increase in activity, and changes at this position were observed in two-thirds of the hyperactive variants isolated.In general, the hyperactive loop variants harbor mutations that increase both hydrophilicity and basicity. These changes presumably destabilize and increase the “floppiness” of the loop by increasing solubility while eliminating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions that would otherwise stabilize the loop in the closed conformation. Asparagine and glutamine would be expected to occur at an average rate of 12% at the codons potentially coding for these residues, based on the synthetic oligonucleotides used to prepare the library (supplemental Table S1), yet they are observed at twice this rate in the isolated hyperactive loop variants (Table 1). Similarly, lysine is expected to randomly occur, on average, 7% of the time at the positions that include codons for it but is observed in 17% of the hyperactive variant positions potentially coding for it. The strongest selective pressure was observed for wild-type residues, however, as exemplified by a 6-fold greater occurrence of proline at position 432 than would be expected based on the synthetic oligonucleotides used to prepare the library.In conclusion, the isolation and characterization of a variety of stable hyperactive ALAS variants lead us to propose that the loop is an important determinant in ALAS activity and may be a hotspot for generation of hyperactive variants. These and other ALA-overproducing ALAS variants may be useful in multiple clinical and agricultural applications. Accumulation of ALA and the consequent build-up of the protoporphyrin IX photosensitizer has long been recognized a powerful vehicle in the photodynamic therapy of tumors and other dysplasias (18Ziolkowski P. Osiecka B.J. Oremek G. Siewinski M. Symonowicz K. Saleh Y. Bronowicz A. Exp. Ther. Oncol. 2004; 4: 121-129PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hua Z. Gibson S.L. Foster T.H. Hilf R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1723-1731PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, ALA can be used as a photodynamic, selective, and biodegradable herbicide or insecticide (19Wang L.J. Jiang W.B. Huang B.J. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 121: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In tumor photodynamic therapy, the porphyrin drug is targeted to and accumulated in the tumor and irradiated to elicit the desired pharmacological response (e.g. apoptosis) (20Dolmans D.E. Fukumura D. Jain R.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). The hyperactive ALAS variants described in this study, which are characterized by enhanced rates of turnover, could potentially add another dimension to photodynamic therapy. Delivery of the DNA encoding the hyperactive ALAS variants to the specific tumor tissue would lead to in vivo localized accumulation of the porphyrin photosensitizer drug, thus increasing therapy specificity and effectiveness. Although the data presented here provide circumstantial support for the hypothesis that ALAS activity is primarily controlled by loop dynamics, this is still unproven and warrants further investigation. The rates of loop motion may be too slow for analysis using current NMR-based approaches (32Boehr D.D. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 3055-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), however; future studies using a Förster resonance energy transfer-based labeling approach may be most appropriate.

Consequently, overexpression of ALAS in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells results in accumulation of the photosensitizing heme precursor protoporphyrin IX (3Whatley S.D. Ducamp S. Gouya L.

This property could potentially lead to novel applications of ALAS or ALAS variants in photodynamic therapy of tumors and other dysplasias (4Gagnebin J. Brunori M. Otter M. Juillerat-Jeanneret L.

ALAS is classified as a fold-type I PLP-dependent enzyme and, like the evolutionarily related l-amino acid transaminases (5Eliot A.C. Kirsch J.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 383-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), functions as a homodimer wherein a PLP cofactor is bound at each of the two active sites, which are recessed in clefts at the subunit interface (6Astner I.

X-ray crystal structures of ALAS from Rhodobacter capsulatus and the closely related enzyme 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase from Escherichia coli reveal an induced fit type mechanism wherein binding of substrates and product, respectively, trigger closure of an extended loop over the active site (6Astner I.

The inferred conformational dynamics of this loop are of interest because kinetic and crystallographic studies support the hypothesis that the rate of ALA (and hence protoporphyrin IX) production is controlled by opening of the active site loop coincident with product release (6Astner I.

This mechanism, if correct, is notable in that the catalytic rate, which is 0.66/s at 37 °C, is slow in comparison with similar conformational motions measured in other enzymes (11Benkovic S.J. Hammes-Schiffer S. Science. 2003; 301: 1196-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar), suggesting that the primary selective pressures for ALAS evolution are oriented away from speed. We posited that if loop dynamics were a primary determinant of the slow catalytic rate, then it should be straightforward to generate hyperactive ALAS variants by targeting nonconserved residues in the active site loop. Besides shedding light on the mechanism of ALA production, hyperactive ALASs might also find philanthropic utility in the generation of ALA for a variety of clinical and agricultural applications (4Gagnebin J.

To test our hypothesis, we employed synthetic mixed base oligonucleotides to generate a library of ALAS loop variants, coupled with a simple screening strategy to isolate potentially hyperactive clones. DISCUSSIONA growing body of experimental evidence supports the theory that enzyme dynamics are not only integral to but also often synchronous with key kinetic steps during biocatalysis (28Eisenmesser E.Z.

Hammes-Schiffer S. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Product release is rate-determining for many enzymatic reactions, and in several cases where this step has been more closely examined, a conformational change of the enzyme has been discovered to be the key kinetic barrier (30Hanson J.A. Duderstadt K. Watkins L.P. Bhattacharyya S. Brokaw J. Chu J.W. Yang H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 18055-18060Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 31Rozovsky S. McDermott A.E. J.

Freeman M.F. Townsend C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If this reaction mechanism were true for ALAS, it should be possible to increase the relatively slow rate of reaction by targeting noncatalytic residues in the conformationally mobile active site loop region.Screening a small subset of the active site loop library resulted in isolation of nine different hyperactive ALASs. Turnover numbers and catalytic efficiencies were increased for each of the purified variant enzymes (Table 2). The catalytic efficiencies for succinyl-CoA were enhanced to a greater extent than those for glycine, consistent with the role of the active site loop in binding this substrate. The variety of sequence alterations leading to hyperactivity suggests that ALAS is not evolving toward catalytic perfection and probably has evolved toward a highly controlled rate of ALA production consistent with its role in the control of porphyrin biosynthesis. It also suggests the possibility of one or more as yet undiscovered allosteric effectors or post-translational modifications that modulate ALAS activity in vivo.The accelerations observed for the presteady state rates associated with intermediate decarboxylation (quinonoid intermediate formation) and protonation of the ALA bound quinonoid intermediate (first step of quinonoid intermediate decay) indicate that nonconserved loop residues can have effects not only on the rate of product release but also on multiple chemical steps in the catalytic cycle. It is thus reasonable to posit that loop dynamics are attuned with multiple steps in the reaction cycle.The most logical interpretation of the absence of a second step of quinonoid intermediate decay in the reactions of the SS2, H1, and F1 variants is that this step has become faster than the first step of quinonoid intermediate decay and is thus kinetically insignificant. This would imply a fundamental change in the nature of the rate-determining step of the reaction cycle in these variants, such that opening of the active site loop coincident with ALA release is no longer the slowest step. The steady state temperature dependence studies with the SS2 variant support this conclusion, because the Q10 for the catalytic rate constant is reduced from seven to two. From the single turnover rates it can be inferred that in the SS2 variant-catalyzed reaction product release has been accelerated by at least 170-fold (Qd2SS2 must be ≥Qd1SS2, which is in turn 170-fold greater than Qd2wt).The nature of the amino acid changes observed in the isolated hyperactive variants can in most cases be logically interpreted in terms of enzyme structure and function. For instance, a previous study found that the kcat value increased 20 and 100% for the R433L and R433K mALAS-2 variants, respectively (34Tan D. Harrison T. Hunter G.A. Ferreira G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1478-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The R. capsulatus crystal structures subsequently revealed that this loop residue comes within bifurcated hydrogen bonding distance of a conserved acidic residue (Asp81 in mALAS-2) in the closed conformation. Disruption of this electrostatic interaction would be expected to destabilize the closed conformation and provide a rationale for the observed increase in activity, and changes at this position were observed in two-thirds of the hyperactive variants isolated.In general, the hyperactive loop variants harbor mutations that increase both hydrophilicity and basicity. These changes presumably destabilize and increase the “floppiness” of the loop by increasing solubility while eliminating hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions that would otherwise stabilize the loop in the closed conformation. Asparagine and glutamine would be expected to occur at an average rate of 12% at the codons potentially coding for these residues, based on the synthetic oligonucleotides used to prepare the library (supplemental Table S1), yet they are observed at twice this rate in the isolated hyperactive loop variants (Table 1). Similarly, lysine is expected to randomly occur, on average, 7% of the time at the positions that include codons for it but is observed in 17% of the hyperactive variant positions potentially coding for it. The strongest selective pressure was observed for wild-type residues, however, as exemplified by a 6-fold greater occurrence of proline at position 432 than would be expected based on the synthetic oligonucleotides used to prepare the library.In conclusion, the isolation and characterization of a variety of stable hyperactive ALAS variants lead us to propose that the loop is an important determinant in ALAS activity and may be a hotspot for generation of hyperactive variants. These and other ALA-overproducing ALAS variants may be useful in multiple clinical and agricultural applications. Accumulation of ALA and the consequent build-up of the protoporphyrin IX photosensitizer has long been recognized a powerful vehicle in the photodynamic therapy of tumors and other dysplasias (18Ziolkowski P.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1723-1731PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, ALA can be used as a photodynamic, selective, and biodegradable herbicide or insecticide (19Wang L.J. Jiang W.B. Huang B.J. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 121: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In tumor photodynamic therapy, the porphyrin drug is targeted to and accumulated in the tumor and irradiated to elicit the desired pharmacological response (e.g. apoptosis) (20Dolmans D.E. Fukumura D. Jain R.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar). The hyperactive ALAS variants described in this study, which are characterized by enhanced rates of turnover, could potentially add another dimension to photodynamic therapy. Delivery of the DNA encoding the hyperactive ALAS variants to the specific tumor tissue would lead to in vivo localized accumulation of the porphyrin photosensitizer drug, thus increasing therapy specificity and effectiveness. Although the data presented here provide circumstantial support for the hypothesis that ALAS activity is primarily controlled by loop dynamics, this is still unproven and warrants further investigation. The rates of loop motion may be too slow for analysis using current NMR-based approaches (32Boehr D.D. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 3055-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), however; future studies using a Förster resonance energy transfer-based labeling approach may be most appropriate.

https://openalex.org/W2046898353,"Annexin-A7 (ANXA7) tumor suppressor role has been shown in various tumors, and ANXA7 expression has been particularly lost in androgen-resistant prostate cancers. In this study, we studied ANXA7 regulation in normal prostate versus androgen-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer cells. Deletion mapping analysis showed lowest ANXA7-promoter activities in androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Genomatix analysis of ANXA7 promoter identified a cluster of steroid nuclear hormone receptor elements, including V$GREF (V$GRE.02/ARE.02). Gelshift analysis clearly indicated distinct nuclear protein occupancy at this ANXA7-promoter site (−1086/−890) in prostate cancer (LNCaP, DU145, and PC3) versus normal prostate (PrEC) cells. In matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based search for ANXA7 nuclear regulators, we identified several heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) (A1, A2/B1 and K) attached to the steroid-associated ANXA7-promoter site in the androgen-resistant PC3 prostate cancer cells with high ANXA7 gene copy number, but not in PrEC. The hnPNP role in ANXA7 regulation (that was validated by hnRNPA2/B1 antibody interference) resulted in multiple ANXA7 cDNA and protein products in PC3, but not in PrEC. Ingenuity pathways analysis showed plausible molecular paths between ANXA7 and the hnRNP-associated network in prostate cancer progression. Thus, a multi-hnRNP complex can be responsible for aberrant ANXA7 transcription and splicing, thereby affecting ANXA7 expression pattern and tumor suppressor function in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1992418768,"Approximately 25% of childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia have an ETV6/RUNX1 (E/R) gene fusion that results from a t(12;21). This genetic subgroup of leukemia is associated with near-triploidy, near-tetraploidy, and trisomy 21 as rather specific types of secondary changes. Here, we show that, unlike various controls, E/R-expressing Ba/F3 clones acquire a tetraploid karyotype on prolonged culture, corroborating the assumption that E/R may attenuate the mitotic checkpoint (MC). Consistent with this notion, E/R-expressing diploid murine and human cell lines have decreased proportions of cells with 4N DNA content and a lower mitotic index when treated with spindle toxins. Moreover, both RUNX1 and E/R regulate mitotic arrest-deficient 2 L1 (MAD2L1), an essential MC component, by binding to promoter-inherent RUNX1 sites, which results in down-regulation of MAD2L1 mRNA and protein in E/R-expressing cells. Forced expression of E/R also abolishes RUNX1-induced reporter activation, whereas E/R with a mutant DNA-binding site leads to only minor effects. Our data link for the first time E/R, MC, and MAD2L1 and provide new insights into the function of the E/R fusion gene product. Although tetraploidy is an almost exclusive feature of E/R-positive leukemias, its rarity within this particular subgroup implies that further yet unknown factors are required for its manifestation."
https://openalex.org/W1974369670,"Zinc-finger (ZF) transcriptional repressor growth factor independence 1 (Gfi-1) has an important role in hematopoiesis and inner ear development, and also functions as an oncoprotein that cooperates with c-Myc in lymphomagenesis. Gfi-1 represses transcription by directly binding to conserved sequences in the promoters of its target genes. CDKN1A encoding p21Cip1 has been identified as a Gfi-1 target gene and has been shown to contain Gfi-1 binding sites in the upstream promoter region. We show here that Gfi-1 represses CDKN1A in a manner that is independent of its DNA binding activity. Gfi-1 interacts with POZ-ZF transcription factor Miz-1, originally shown to be a c-Myc-interacting partner, and through Miz-1 binds to the CDKN1A core promoter. Interestingly, Gfi-1 and c-Myc, through Miz-1, form a ternary complex on the CDKN1A promoter, and function in collaboration to repress CDKN1A. Gfi-1 knockdown results in enhanced levels of p21Cip1 and attenuated cell proliferation. Notably, similar to c-Myc, the expression of Gfi-1 is downregulated by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and the level of Gfi-1 influences the response of cells to the cytostatic effect of TGFβ. Our data reveal an important mechanism by which Gfi-1 regulates cell proliferation and may also have implications for understanding the role of Gfi-1 in lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1974960822,"The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B is a key enzyme of the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and a major therapeutic target. Applying a novel continuous assay with highly purified protein and a fluorescent RNA-template we provide for the first time a comprehensive mechanistic description of the enzymatic reaction. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, the kinetics of NS5B was confirmed to consist of two half-reactions, namely substrate binding and turnover. Determining the binding constants of the substrates and the rate constants of individual reaction steps, NS5B was shown to bind the template single-stranded RNA with high affinity (nanomolar range) and in a stepwise process that reflects the substrate positioning. As demonstrated by CD, NTP(s) binding caused a tertiary structural change of the enzyme into an active conformation. The second half-reaction was dissected into a sequential polymerization and a subsequent, rate-limiting product release reaction. Taking advantage of these tools, we analyzed the mechanism of action of the NS5B inhibitor HCV-796, which was shown to interfere with the formation of double-stranded RNA by blocking the second half-reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2011813397,"Spi-1/PU.1 oncogene is downregulated as proerythroblasts undergo terminal differentiation. Insertion of the Friend virus upstream of the Spi-1/PU.1 locus leads to the constitutive upregulation of Spi-1/PU.1, and a subsequent block in the differentiation of the affected erythroblasts. We have shown that sustained overexpression of Spi-1/PU.1 also inhibits the erythroid splicing of protein 4.1R exon 16, irrespective of chemical induction of differentiation. Here, we show a positive feedback loop that couples constitutive phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling to high expression of Spi-1/PU.1 in Friend erythroleukemia cells. Inhibition of PI3K/AKT results in Spi-1/PU.1 downregulation in a stepwise manner and induces cell differentiation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further supported the positive autoregulatory effect of Spi-1/PU.1. Mutational analysis indicated that Ser41, but not Ser148, is necessary for Spi-1/PU.1-mediated repression of hemoglobin expression, whereas both Ser residues are required for Spi-1/PU.1 inhibition of the erythroid splicing event. We further show that inhibition of the erythroid transcriptional and splicing events are strictly dependent on distinct Spi-1/PU.1 phosphorylation modifications rather than Spi-1/PU.1 expression level per se. Our data further support the fact that Spi-1/PU.1 inhibits 4.1R erythroid splicing through two different pathways, and bring new insights into the extracellular signal impact triggered by erythropoietin on late erythroid regulatory program, including pre-mRNA splicing."

Whereas mammalian 5-LOX transforms its primary product (5S-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid; 5S-HPETE) almost exclusively to LTA4, the model enzyme, soybean LOX-1, normally produces no detectable leukotrienes and instead further oxygenates its primary product 15S-HPETE to 5,15- and 8,15-dihydroperoxides. Mammalian 15-LOX-1 displays both types of activity. We reasoned that availability of molecular oxygen within the LOX active site favors oxygenation, whereas lack of O2 promotes LTA epoxide synthesis. To test this, we reacted 15S-HPETE with soybean LOX-1 under anaerobic conditions and identified the products by high pressure liquid chromatography, UV, mass spectrometry, and NMR. Among the products, we identified a pair of 8,15-dihydroxy diastereomers with all-trans-conjugated trienes that incorporated 18O from H218O at C-8, indicative of the formation of 14,15-LTA4. A pair of 5,15-dihydroxy diastereomers containing two trans,trans-conjugated dienes (6E,8E,11E,13E) and that incorporated 18O from H218O at C-5 was deduced to arise from hydrolysis of a novel epoxide containing a cyclopropyl ring, 14,15-epoxy-[9,10,11-cyclopropyl]-eicosa-5Z,7E,13E-trienoic acid. Also identified was the δ-lactone of the 5,15-diol, a derivative that exhibited no 18O incorporation due to its formation by intramolecular reaction of the carboxyl anion with the proposed epoxide intermediate. Our results support a model in which access to molecular oxygen within the active site directs the outcome from competing pathways in the secondary reactions of lipoxygenases.

A pair of 5,15-dihydroxy diastereomers containing two trans,trans-conjugated dienes (6E,8E,11E,13E) and that incorporated 18O from H218O at C-5 was deduced to arise from hydrolysis of a novel epoxide containing a cyclopropyl ring, 14,15-epoxy-[9,10,11-cyclopropyl]-eicosa-5Z,7E,13E-trienoic acid. Also identified was the δ-lactone of the 5,15-diol, a derivative that exhibited no 18O incorporation due to its formation by intramolecular reaction of the carboxyl anion with the proposed epoxide intermediate. Our results support a model in which access to molecular oxygen within the active site directs the outcome from competing pathways in the secondary reactions of lipoxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W2069900567,"The cellular transcription factor Brn-3a differentially regulates different human papilloma virus (HPV)-16 variants that are associated with different risks of progression to cervical carcinoma in infected humans. The upstream regulatory regions (URRs) of high- and intermediate-risk HPV-16 variants are activated by the cellular transcription factor Brn-3a, whereas the URR of a low-risk HPV-16 variant is not. In this study, we show in transfection assays that Brn-3a and the smoking-related substance nicotine produce stronger responsiveness of the URR of the low- and high-risk variants than with either factor alone, but not the intermediate-risk variant. We determined that this synergistic activity of Brn-3a/nicotine is due to two nucleotide differences in the URR, crucial for oncogenic E6/E7 transactivation. Mutant constructs in which the nucleotide residues were substituted alter Brn-3a/nicotine responsiveness. Importantly, women smokers with high levels of Brn-3a infected with low- or high-risk HPV-16 variants have augmented E6 levels, and were more frequently diagnosed with higher grades of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cancer, as compared with non-smokers who were infected with similar variants and expressed similar levels of Brn-3a. Therefore, this study defines the specific interplay between the cellular transactivator Brn-3a, the environmental smoking-related substance nicotine and specific HPV variants in cervical carcinogenesis, and thus helps to explain why some women are susceptible to rapid CIN progression and cancer and others are not."
