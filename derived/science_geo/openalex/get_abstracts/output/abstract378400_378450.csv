https://openalex.org/W2014509855,"Therapeutics that are designed to engage RNA interference (RNAi) pathways have the potential to provide new, major ways of imparting therapy to patients. Long, double-stranded RNAs were first shown to mediate RNAi in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the potential use of RNAi for human therapy has been demonstrated by the finding that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; approximately 21-base-pair double-stranded RNA) can elicit RNAi in mammalian cells without producing an interferon response. We are at present conducting the first in-human phase I clinical trial involving the systemic administration of siRNA to patients with solid cancers using a targeted, nanoparticle delivery system. Here we provide evidence of inducing an RNAi mechanism of action in a human from the delivered siRNA. Tumour biopsies from melanoma patients obtained after treatment show the presence of intracellularly localized nanoparticles in amounts that correlate with dose levels of the nanoparticles administered (this is, to our knowledge, a first for systemically delivered nanoparticles of any kind). Furthermore, a reduction was found in both the specific messenger RNA (M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RRM2)) and the protein (RRM2) levels when compared to pre-dosing tissue. Most notably, we detect the presence of an mRNA fragment that demonstrates that siRNA-mediated mRNA cleavage occurs specifically at the site predicted for an RNAi mechanism from a patient who received the highest dose of the nanoparticles. Together, these data demonstrate that siRNA administered systemically to a human can produce a specific gene inhibition (reduction in mRNA and protein) by an RNAi mechanism of action."

By examining how mesenchymal osteolineage cells modulate haematopoiesis, here we show that deletion of Dicer1 specifically in mouse osteoprogenitors, but not in mature osteoblasts, disrupts the integrity of haematopoiesis. Myelodysplasia resulted and acute myelogenous leukaemia emerged that had acquired several genetic abnormalities while having intact Dicer1. Examining gene expression altered in osteoprogenitors as a result of Dicer1 deletion showed reduced expression of Sbds, the gene mutated in Schwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome-a human bone marrow failure and leukaemia pre-disposition condition. Deletion of Sbds in mouse osteoprogenitors induced bone marrow dysfunction with myelodysplasia. Therefore, perturbation of specific mesenchymal subsets of stromal cells can disorder differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis of heterologous cells, and disrupt tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, primary stromal dysfunction can result in secondary neoplastic disease, supporting the concept of niche-induced oncogenesis."

Multivesicular bodies are formed when cargo-rich patches of the limiting membrane of endosomes bud inwards by an unknown mechanism and are then cleaved to yield cargo-bearing intralumenal vesicles. The biogenesis of multivesicular bodies was reconstituted and visualized using giant unilamellar vesicles, fluorescent ESCRT-0, -I, -II and -III complexes, and a membrane-tethered fluorescent ubiquitin fusion as a model cargo. Here we show that ESCRT-0 forms domains of clustered cargo but does not deform membranes. ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II in combination deform the membrane into buds, in which cargo is confined. ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II localize to the bud necks, and recruit ESCRT-0-ubiquitin domains to the buds. ESCRT-III subunits localize to the bud neck and efficiently cleave the buds to form intralumenal vesicles. Intralumenal vesicles produced in this reaction contain the model cargo but are devoid of ESCRTs. The observations explain how the ESCRTs direct membrane budding and scission from the cytoplasmic side of the bud without being consumed in the reaction. Internalized proteins destined for degradation are delivered to lysosomes via multivesicular bodies (MVBs). In this pathway, cargo proteins are ubiquitinated and sorted by the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) complexes 0, I, II, and III. Thomas Wollert and James Hurley have reconstituted MVB biogenesis using giant unilamellar vesicles and all the ESCRT complexes. They find that ESCRT-0 is required for clustering of cargo proteins, while ESCRT-I and II in combination deform the membrane into buds, in which cargo is confined. ESCRT-III subunits localize to the bud neck and are required for scission of the membrane to form intralumenal vesicles. These results explain how ESCRT complexes sequester cargo proteins into MVBs. Here, multivesicular body (MVB) biogenesis is reconstituted using giant unilamellar vesicles and all of the ESCRT complexes. ESCRT-0 is required for clustering of cargo proteins, whereas ESCRT-I and -II in combination deform the membrane into buds, in which cargo is confined. ESCRT-III subunits localize to the bud neck and are required for scission of the membrane to form intraluminal vesicles. These results explain how ESCRT complexes sequester cargo proteins into MVBs."

https://openalex.org/W2124390519,"Breeding to increase beta-carotene levels in cereal grains, termed provitamin A biofortification, is an economical approach to address dietary vitamin A deficiency in the developing world. Experimental evidence from association and linkage populations in maize (Zea mays L.) demonstrate that the gene encoding beta-carotene hydroxylase 1 (crtRB1) underlies a principal quantitative trait locus associated with beta-carotene concentration and conversion in maize kernels. crtRB1 alleles associated with reduced transcript expression correlate with higher beta-carotene concentrations. Genetic variation at crtRB1 also affects hydroxylation efficiency among encoded allozymes, as observed by resultant carotenoid profiles in recombinant expression assays. The most favorable crtRB1 alleles, rare in frequency and unique to temperate germplasm, are being introgressed via inexpensive PCR marker-assisted selection into tropical maize germplasm adapted to developing countries, where it is most needed for human health."

https://openalex.org/W2031076586,"Massive galaxies in the early Universe have been shown to be forming stars at surprisingly high rates. Prominent examples are dust-obscured galaxies which are luminous when observed at sub-millimeter (sub-mm) wavelengths and which may be forming stars at rates upto 1,000Mo/yr. These intense bursts of star formation are believed to be driven by mergers between gas rich galaxies. However, probing the properties of individual star-forming regions within these galaxies is beyond the spatial resolution and sensitivity of even the largest telescopes at present. Here, we report observations of the sub-mm galaxy SMMJ2135-0102 at redshift z=2.3259 which has been gravitationally magnified by a factor of 32 by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens. This cosmic magnification, when combined with high-resolution sub-mm imaging, resolves the star-forming regions at a linear scale of just ~100 parsecs. We find that the luminosity densities of these star-forming regions are comparable to the dense cores of giant molecular clouds in the local Universe, but they are ~100x larger and 10^7 times more luminous. Although vigorously star-forming, the underlying physics of the star formation processes at z~2 appears to be similar to that seen in local galaxies even though the energetics are unlike anything found in the present-day Universe."

https://openalex.org/W1979480120,"Although the precipitating mechanisms of atrial fibrillation are not fully understood, atrial fibrosis is thought to set the stage for arrhythmia. Volker Rudolph et al. now show that the enzyme myeloperoxidase, released by inflammatory cells, is a key inducer of atrial fibrosis and arrhythmia in a mouse model of atrial fibrillation, and that myeloperoxidase levels are associated with atrial fibrillation in humans. Observational clinical and ex vivo studies have established a strong association between atrial fibrillation and inflammation1. However, whether inflammation is the cause or the consequence of atrial fibrillation and which specific inflammatory mediators may increase the atria's susceptibility to fibrillation remain elusive. Here we provide experimental and clinical evidence for the mechanistic involvement of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a heme enzyme abundantly expressed by neutrophils, in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation. MPO-deficient mice pretreated with angiotensin II (AngII) to provoke leukocyte activation showed lower atrial tissue abundance of the MPO product 3-chlorotyrosine, reduced activity of matrix metalloproteinases and blunted atrial fibrosis as compared to wild-type mice. Upon right atrial electrophysiological stimulation, MPO-deficient mice were protected from atrial fibrillation, which was reversed when MPO was restored. Humans with atrial fibrillation had higher plasma concentrations of MPO and a larger MPO burden in right atrial tissue as compared to individuals devoid of atrial fibrillation. In the atria, MPO colocalized with markedly increased formation of 3-chlorotyrosine. Our data demonstrate that MPO is a crucial prerequisite for structural remodeling of the myocardium, leading to an increased vulnerability to atrial fibrillation."
https://openalex.org/W2140025765,"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal is regulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic signals. Although some of the pathways that regulate HSC self-renewal have been uncovered, it remains largely unknown whether these pathways can be triggered by deliverable growth factors to induce HSC growth or regeneration. Here we show that pleiotrophin, a neurite outgrowth factor with no known function in hematopoiesis, efficiently promotes HSC expansion in vitro and HSC regeneration in vivo. Treatment of mouse bone marrow HSCs with pleiotrophin caused a marked increase in long-term repopulating HSC numbers in culture, as measured in competitive repopulating assays. Treatment of human cord blood CD34(+)CDCD38(-)Lin(-) cells with pleiotrophin also substantially increased severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-repopulating cell counts in culture, compared to input and cytokine-treated cultures. Systemic administration of pleiotrophin to irradiated mice caused a pronounced expansion of bone marrow stem and progenitor cells in vivo, indicating that pleiotrophin is a regenerative growth factor for HSCs. Mechanistically, pleiotrophin activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in HSCs; antagonism of PI3K or Notch signaling inhibited pleiotrophin-mediated expansion of HSCs in culture. We identify the secreted growth factor pleiotrophin as a new regulator of both HSC expansion and regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2070190311,"The peptidoglycan layer is a vital component of the bacterial cell wall. The existing paradigm describes the peptidoglycan network as a static structure that is cross-linked predominantly by 4-->3 transpeptide linkages. However, the nonclassical 3-->3 linkages predominate the transpeptide networking of the peptidoglycan layer of nonreplicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The molecular basis of these linkages and their role in the physiology of the peptidoglycan layer, virulence and susceptibility of M. tuberculosis to drugs remain undefined. Here we identify MT2594 as an L,D-transpeptidase that generates 3-->3 linkages in M. tuberculosis. We show that the loss of this protein leads to altered colony morphology, loss of virulence and increased susceptibility to amoxicillin-clavulanate during the chronic phase of infection. This suggests that 3-->3 cross-linking is vital to the physiology of the peptidoglycan layer. Although a functional homolog exists, expression of ldtMt2 is dominant throughout the growth phases of M. tuberculosis. 4-->3 transpeptide linkages are targeted by one of the most widely used classes of antibacterial drugs in human clinical use today, beta-lactams. Recently, meropenem-clavulanate was shown to be effective against drug-resistant M. tuberculosis. Our study suggests that a combination of L,D-transpeptidase and beta-lactamase inhibitors could effectively target persisting bacilli during the chronic phase of tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2070461863,"Apoptotic cells are removed from tissues through recognition and engulfment by phagocytes. While recent studies have identified receptors that mediate interactions between apoptotic cells and phagocytes, the molecular mechanisms underlying the degradation of apoptotic cells following engulfment remain unclear. Here, Jason Kinchen and Kodi Ravichandran identify two evolutionarily conserved genes that are required for the processing of ingested apoptotic cells in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells. These genes are required for phagosome maturation through a mechanism involving Rab conversion. As poor engulfment of apoptotic cells is associated with some diseases, understanding this process could lead to new treatments. In multicellular organisms, apoptotic cells are removed from tissues by phagocytes, which recognize and engulf the dying cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying the subsequent degradation of the cells have been unclear. Here, two evolutionarily conserved genes have been identified that are required for such processing in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. An understanding of these events could lead to new treatments for diseases associated with poor engulfment and destruction of dying cells. Engulfment of apoptotic cells occurs throughout life in multicellular organisms. Impaired apoptotic cell clearance (due to defective recognition, internalization or degradation) results in autoimmune disease1,2. One fundamental challenge in understanding how defects in corpse removal translate into diseased states is the identification of critical components orchestrating the different stages of engulfment. Here we use genetic, cell biological and molecular studies in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammalian cells to identify SAND-1 and its partner CCZ-1 as new factors in corpse removal. In worms deficient in either sand-1 or ccz-1, apoptotic cells are internalized and the phagosomes recruit the small GTPase RAB-5 but fail to progress to the subsequent RAB-7(+) stage. The mammalian orthologues of SAND-1, namely Mon1a and Mon1b, were similarly required for phagosome maturation. Mechanistically, Mon1 interacts with GTP-bound Rab5, identifying Mon1 as a previously unrecognized Rab5 effector. Moreover, a Mon1–Ccz1 complex (but not either protein alone) could bind Rab7 and could also influence Rab7 activation, suggesting Mon1–Ccz1 as an important link in progression from the Rab5-positive stage to the Rab7-positive stage of phagosome maturation. Taken together, these data identify SAND-1 (Mon1) and CCZ-1 (Ccz1) as critical and evolutionarily conserved components regulating the processing of ingested apoptotic cell corpses."
https://openalex.org/W2048881833,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that are associated with the conformational conversion of a normal prion protein, PrPC, to a misfolded aggregated form, PrPSc.

The protein misfolding cyclic amplification reactions have been recently shown to propagate prions using brain-derived or recombinant prion protein, but only in the presence of additional cofactors such as nucleic acids and lipids.

The pathogenic process in these diseases is typically associated with conformational conversion of a normal (cellular) prion protein, PrPC, to a misfolded form, PrPSc. The “protein-only” model asserts that this rogue PrPSc conformer itself represents the infectious prion agent, self-propagating by binding to PrPC and inducing its conversion to the abnormal PrPSc isoform (6Prusiner S.B.

Wang X. Yuan C.G. Ma J. Science. 2010; 327: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). However, the presence of other mammalian cell-derived molecules in these preparations leaves open the question regarding the precise chemical identity of mammalian prions. It has also been reported that amyloid fibrils formed spontaneously from rPrP in the absence of any added cofactors can cause a transmissible neurological disorder in transgenic mice (12Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.O. Riesner D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 2004; 305: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 13Colby D.W. Giles K. Legname G. Wille H.

However, because the transgenic mice used in these studies overproduce PrPC (4–32-fold when compared with wild-type mice), it is unclear whether these synthetic fibrils indeed carry bona fide infectivity or, rather, accelerate a condition to which transgenic mice could potentially be predisposed due to the high level of PrPC or other factors (14Nazor K.E.

This question is especially pressing because numerous attempts to infect wild-type mice or hamsters with similar material have not been successful.We have shown recently that structurally distinct fibrillar aggregates can be produced from rPrP by PMCA when seeded with scrapie-derived brain homogenate or partially purified PrPSc (15Atarashi R.

Importantly, these PrPSc-seeded aggregates (denoted rPrPPMCA or rPrP-res(Sc)) display a proteinase K (PK) digestion pattern that is more closely related to PrPSc than that of spontaneously formed rPrP fibrils (15Atarashi R.

Here, we report that these aggregates, prepared solely from highly purified recombinant hamster prion protein (rShaPrP) in the apparent absence of any additional cofactors, are infectious to wild-type hamsters.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo test the infectivity of rPrPPMCA fibrils, we performed nine rounds of PMCA using as a substrate recombinant Syrian hamster full-length PrP (rShaPrP-(23–231)) or the 90–231 fragment (rShaPrP-(90–231)). In the first round, the reaction was seeded with partially purified, PK-digested PrPSc (PrP27–30) derived from 263K scrapie-infected hamster brain. Each subsequent round was seeded with a 1/10 or 1/100 volume of PMCA product from the previous round (see “Experimental Procedures”). The cumulative 10−14 dilution of the original PrPSc seed theoretically made its concentration ∼0.01 ag/ml or 0.2 molecules/ml, an amount ∼107-fold below one LD50 (a dose lethal to 50% of intracerebrally inoculated hamsters).Multiple independently prepared rShaPrP-(23–231)PMCA or rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA preparations were harvested and inoculated intracerebrally into groups of hamsters. Remarkably, a fraction of inoculated animals in all but one group developed clinical signs of scrapie, although there was considerable variability in the incubation times (ranging from 119 to 401 days) and attack rates (Table 1). In the second passage experiments using brain extract from affected hamsters as the inocula, all hamsters became infected with an incubation time of 84 ± 1 and 75 ± 4 days for rShaPrP-(23–231)PMCA- and rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA-derived material, respectively (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of infectivity bioassays in hamstersInoculumaFifty microliters of each inoculum were used.

Open table in a new tab In control experiments, hamsters were inoculated with either undiluted PrP27–30 seed or a 1014-fold dilution thereof (equivalent to cumulative serial PMCA dilution). As expected, animals inoculated with the undiluted PrP27–30 seed succumbed to scrapie disease with a typical incubation time of 85 ± 4 days. In contrast, all hamsters inoculated with diluted PrP27–30 remained healthy (Table 1), confirming that the serial PMCA procedure was sufficient to dilute out all of the original PrP27–30-associated infectivity. A caveat of any infectivity studies with “synthetic prions” is potential contamination with exogenously derived infectivity during either sample preparation or inoculation of animals. To address this issue, we have performed control experiments using a mock PMCA procedure in which PrP27–30 seed was subjected to the PMCA protocol used to generate rShaPrPPMCA but without any rPrP substrate. No infectivity was detected in this material (Table 1), strongly arguing against the likelihood of contamination. Furthermore, bioassays with rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA were performed independently in two different laboratories, consistently indicating infectivity of this material (Table 1). Given the possibility of spontaneous (non-seeded) rPrP prion formation by PMCA (see below), mock experiments described above represent the only reliable negative control in this type of study.Western blot analysis revealed that brains of all hamsters showing clinical TSE signs accumulated PrPSc. Electrophoretic profiles of PrPSc from hamsters inoculated with rShaPrP-(23–231)PMCA and rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA, as well as those inoculated in second passage experiments (i.e. using brain homogenates of rShaPrP-(23–231)PMCA and rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA-infected animals), were indistinguishable from those infected with 263K-PrP27–30 (Fig. 1A), indicating similar PK cleavage site(s) as well as a similar ratio of different PrPSc glycoforms.rShaPrPPMCA-inoculated hamsters showed TSE brain pathology, although spongiform degeneration was less severe when compared with hamsters inoculated with 263K scrapie (Fig. 1, B–F, and supplemental Fig. 1). Importantly, the lesion profiles for hamsters inoculated with rShaPrP-(23–231)PMCA and rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA were very similar to each other but were both significantly different from that of 263K scrapie-inoculated hamsters (Fig. 1B). These distinct lesion profiles found in rShaPrPPMCA-inoculated hamsters were preserved upon second passage (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that rShaPrPPMCA represents a stable prion strain that is different from 263K scrapie. The overall pattern of PrPSc immunostaining in rShaPrPPMCA-inoculated hamsters was similar to hamsters inoculated with 263K scrapie. However, the PrPSc staining intensity was markedly lower in hamsters inoculated with rShaPrPPMCA, and this low staining intensity was maintained in the second passage (Fig. 2, C–E). Again, this points to distinct strain properties of rShaPrPPMCA, strongly arguing against the possibility that contamination could be responsible for the infectivity of the rPrPPMCA preparations. The apparent emergence of a new prion strain (that is, distinct from the 263K scrapie seed) in our PMCA reaction is puzzling, especially given the previous findings that PMCA can preserve strain characteristics of the seed (7Castilla J.

Virol. 2009; 83: 5321-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, our bacterially expressed rPrP substrate differs from the brain-derived PrPC used in previous studies in at least two additional aspects that might influence the fidelity of strain characteristics. One is the absence of any additional brain components that copurify with brain-derived PrPC (8Deleault N.R. Harris B.T. Rees J.R. Supattapone S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9741-9746Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), and the other is the lack of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The latter modification may modify strain properties of in vitro-generated prions, consistent with the recent findings regarding the role of the lipid moiety of the substrate in PrPSc amplification by PMCA (24Kim J.I. Surewicz K. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 3671-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Comparison of lesion profiles and PrPSc staining observed in first and second passage of rShaPrPPMCA prions.

In the latter system, conformation-encoded strain properties of infectious amyloid fibrils prepared in vitro from recombinant yeast prion protein were fully preserved upon transfection into living cells, and this strain-specific fidelity was considered important for formally proving the concept of protein conformation-based inheritance in yeast (25King C.Y. Diaz-Avalos R. Nature. 2004; 428: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 26Tanaka M. Chien P. Naber N. Cooke R. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2004; 428: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Such perfect reproduction of strain-specific patterns in experiments with synthetic mammalian prions may require the use of pure PrP substrate that is chemically identical to brain PrPC (i.e. with posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation and the GPI anchor).Given the above caveat of studies with aggregates generated in vitro from bacterially expressed recombinant PrP, one cannot formally rule out the possibility that these preparations trigger infectious TSE disease by some unknown mechanism other than acting as a physical template for the conversion of brain PrPC into the PrPSc state. However, the latter possibility is purely theoretical and highly unlikely.The recently reported de novo generation of infectivity (i.e. in the absence of any preexisting PrPSc seed) from brain-derived PrPC and poly(A) RNA (8Deleault N.R. Harris B.T. Rees J.R. Supattapone S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 9741-9746Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), total brain homogenate (9Barria M.A. Mukherjee A. Gonzalez-Romero D. Morales R. Soto C. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000421Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), or recombinant PrP in the presence of mouse RNA and lipids (11Wang F. Wang X. Yuan C.G. Ma J. Science. 2010; 327: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) raises the question as to whether this could also be accomplished using highly purified rPrP in the absence of any cofactors. Our preliminary data suggest that infectious material can indeed be generated de novo from pure rShaPrP, although the probability of such an event appears to be very low. These experiments with de novo generated rPrP prions are still ongoing; after completion, they will be reported elsewhere.Altogether, the present data demonstrate that infectious prions can be generated by PMCA from highly purified rPrP in the absence of any apparent cofactors. rPrP differs from typical brain-derived PrPC by its lack of N-linked glycans and a GPI moiety, and these data confirm previous indications that these post-translational modifications are not essential for prion propagation in vivo (27Tuzi N.L. Cancellotti E. Baybutt H. Blackford L. Bradford B. Plinston C. Coghill A. Hart P. Piccardo P. Barron R.M. Manson J.C. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e100Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Chesebro B. Trifilo M. Race R. Meade-White K. Teng C. LaCasse R. Raymond L. Favara C. Baron G. Priola S. Caughey B. Masliah E. Oldstone M. Science. 2005; 308: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Variable attack rates and long incubation times indicate that the infectivity of rShaPrPPMCA is very low relative to brain-derived PrPSc. This is consistent with our observation that inoculation of hamsters with rShaPrP-(90–231)PMCA at ∼25-fold lower dose than that described in Table 1 did not cause any signs of TSE (data not shown). Although the reasons for much lower infectivity of our conversion product (per unit of protein) when compared with that of brain-derived PrPSc are at present unclear, this could be due to one of the following factors (or a combination thereof). (i) The infectious material might constitute only a small subfraction of our PMCA product; (ii) other cofactors that are supplied in vivo, and not in our scrapie-seeded rPrP-PMCA reactions, might promote the infectivity of the conversion product; (iii) non-infectious off-pathway products of the rPrP-PMCA reaction might interfere with the infectivity, or promote the clearance, of the infectious scrapie-seeded rPrP PMCA product. The complete attack rate and greatly reduced incubation period on second passage indicate that the artificial rShaPrPPMCA prions adapt to hamsters, as takes place with archetypal prion diseases.It was recently reported that material infectious to wild-type mice can be formed de novo from the mixture of mouse rPrP and relatively large quantities of mouse-derived RNA and an acidic lipid, phosphatidylglycerol (11Wang F. Wang X. Yuan C.G. Ma J. Science. 2010; 327: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Some apparent infectivity was also reported to be associated with spontaneously formed recombinant PrP amyloid fibrils subjected to “annealing” by incubation with normal brain homogenate, although in this case, clinical signs were observed only in the second passage and only after very long incubation times (481–565 days) (29Makarava N. Kovacs G.G. Bocharova O. Savtchenko R. Alexeeva I. Budka H. Rohwer R.G. Baskakov I.V. Acta Neuropathol. 2010; 119: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In contrast to these recent studies on de novo generated infectivity, the infectious material in our work was generated in a PrPSc-seeded PMCA reaction and, most importantly, in the absence of any added cofactors. The finding that truly infectious prions causing clinical TSE disease in a wild-type host can be generated from pure bacterially expressed prion protein provides a strong support for the protein-only model of these neurological disorders. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that additional cofactors that have been used in previous studies (nucleic acids, lipids) are not obligatory for generation of infectious mammalian prions. However, given the apparent low infectivity titer of the material generated in the present study, it appears that these (and/or other) cofactors may enhance or accelerate prion protein misfolding to the infectious form in vitro as well as in vivo.

The pathogenic process in these diseases is typically associated with conformational conversion of a normal (cellular) prion protein, PrPC, to a misfolded form, PrPSc. The “protein-only” model asserts that this rogue PrPSc conformer itself represents the infectious prion agent, self-propagating by binding to PrPC and inducing its conversion to the abnormal PrPSc isoform (6Prusiner S.B.

IntroductionThe outstanding specificity of therapeutic glycoproteins places them among the fastest growing class of pharmaceutical products. Many of these drugs need terminal sialylation, the final and most complex step of human N-glycosylation, for optimal therapeutic potency. Therefore manufacturing is currently restricted to mammalian cell-based systems that are able to perform this important posttranslational modification, although with major limitations. The naturally present glycosylation repertoire of mammalian host cells promotes the generation of a number of different terminal structures and thus leads to heterogeneous glycosylation. Moreover, these modifications may differ from the authentic human glycosylation.

These shortcomings in many cases lead to drugs with reduced biological potency, of which recombinant hormones such as human erythropoietin and interferons are prominent examples (1Bork K. Horstkorte R. Weidemann W. J. Pharm. Sci. 2009; 98: 3499-3508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, about 10% of the N-glycans in the Fc region of human serum IgG is sialylated (2Stadlmann J. Pabst M. Kolarich D. Kunert R. Altmann F. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Although the anti-inflammatory effects of sialylated IgG have recently been demonstrated (3Anthony R.M. Nimmerjahn F. Ashline D.J. Reinhold V.N. Paulson J.C. Ravetch J.V. Science. 2008; 320: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), very little information on the impact of this common modification at the molecular level is available (4Scallon B.J. Tam S.H. McCarthy S.G. Cai A.N. Raju T.S. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This explains the general interest in novel expression hosts and strategies to engineer glycosylation not only to increase the value of therapeutic proteins but also to better understand the role of glycosylation in general and sialylation in particular in fundamental biological processes.Plants are considered an attractive alternative expression platform for therapeutic human glycoproteins because they are cost-effective, highly scalable, free from human pathogens, and, importantly, can carry out complex N-glycosylation (5Stoger E. Ma J.K. Fischer R. Christou P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2005; 16: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 6Gleba Y. Klimyuk V. Marillonnet S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2007; 18: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In addition, plants glycosylate proteins with considerable uniformity, which may provide an advantage over mammalian-based expression systems. However, plants lack sialylated N-glycans, which restrict their utility as a versatile production platform. Recent studies have shown that the plant N-glycosylation pathway can be modified toward human-type glycosylation (7Cox K.M. Sterling J.D. Regan J.T. Gasdaska J.R. Frantz K.K. Peele C.G. Black A.

Elimination of plant-specific glycosylation in our laboratory and by others has resulted in the generation of plant lines (e.g. ΔXT/FT) that produce therapeutically relevant proteins carrying a human-like glycosylation profile (GnGn structures). Importantly, monoclonal antibodies produced in such lines exhibited enhanced effector functions (7Cox K.M. Sterling J.D. Regan J.T. Gasdaska J.R. Frantz K.K. Peele C.G. Black A. Passmore D.

Mach L. Glössl J. Weterings K. Pabst M. Steinkellner H. Plant Biotechnol. J. 2008; 6: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated recently that by overexpressing a modified version of the human β1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT), plant N-glycans can be extended with β1,4-linked galactose at great uniformity (10Strasser R. Castilho A. Stadlmann J. Kunert R. Quendler H. Gattinger P. Jez J. Rademacher T. Altmann F. Mach L. Steinkellner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20479-20485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these structures serve as acceptor substrates for subsequent terminal sialylation. However, sialylation is particularly difficult to accomplish even in the presence of β1,4-galactosylated structures because plants lack some further essential prerequisites: (i) the biosynthetic capability to produce the sugar nucleotide precursor CMP-sialic acid, specifically CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac); (ii) a transporter that delivers CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi in sufficient amounts; and (iii) a sialyltransferase (ST) to transfer sialic acid from CMP-Neu5Ac to terminal galactose on the nascent glycoprotein. Moreover, these proteins and their substrates must work in a highly coordinated fashion at different stages of the pathway, and thus organelle-specific targeting of several components is required to enable proper protein sialylation (see Fig. 1). Initial attempts to introduce Neu5Ac residues into plant N-glycans have resulted in the expression of some of these proteins in plants (11Wee E.G. Sherrier D.J. Prime T.A. Dupree P. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12Misaki R. Fujiyama K. Seki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 1184-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and recent progress in our laboratory allowed the synthesis of the sugar nucleotide CMP-Neu5Ac from endogenous metabolites by the simultaneous overexpression of three mammalian enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana (13Castilho A. Pabst M. Leonard R. Veit C. Altmann F. Mach L. Glössl J. Strasser R. Steinkellner H. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, in planta protein sialylation has not yet been achieved.In this study, we aimed to achieve in planta sialylation in Nicotiana benthamiana, a tobacco-related plant species particularly well suited for recombinant protein expression (14Giritch A. Marillonnet S. Engler C. van Eldik G. Botterman J. Klimyuk V. Gleba Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14701-14706Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Six mammalian proteins comprising the sialic acid pathway were co-expressed together with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) in N. benthamiana wild type (WT) and glycosylation mutant plants thereof. Purified mAbs were subjected to glycosylation analyses and tested for functional integrity.DISCUSSIONHere we report the efficient in planta sialylation of a therapeutic protein as exemplified by a recombinant mAb. This was achieved by the coordinated overexpression of six mammalian proteins that act at various stages of the biosynthetic pathway in different subcellular compartments. Quantitative sialylation was facilitated by the specific modification of some of these proteins, i.e. elimination of activity-destroying amino acid sequences (in the case of CMAS) (13Castilho A. Pabst M. Leonard R. Veit C. Altmann F. Mach L. Glössl J. Strasser R. Steinkellner H. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and by enabling proper subcellular localization (in the case of ST-GalT) (10Strasser R. Castilho A. Stadlmann J. Kunert R. Quendler H. Gattinger P. Jez J. Rademacher T. Altmann F. Mach L. Steinkellner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20479-20485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Notably, nearly all of the available acceptor substrates (i.e. galactosylated glycans) present in WT and in the glycosylation mutants were sialylated. The synthesis of incompletely processed structures such as MNai, MNaFi, and MNaXi is most likely due to inappropriate overexpression of ST-GalT interfering with the action of GlcNAc-T II. Incompletely processed glycans with one antenna terminating in mannose (MAXFi and MAi, Fig. 6a and data not shown, respectively) were present in WT and ΔXT/FT plants expressing only ST-GalT, an observation already made previously (10Strasser R. Castilho A. Stadlmann J. Kunert R. Quendler H. Gattinger P. Jez J. Rademacher T. Altmann F. Mach L. Steinkellner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20479-20485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). This shortcoming may be overcome by optimizing the expression system as demonstrated for stably transformed GalT+ plants (10Strasser R. Castilho A. Stadlmann J. Kunert R. Quendler H. Gattinger P. Jez J. Rademacher T. Altmann F. Mach L. Steinkellner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20479-20485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Note that GalT+ plants were not considered for sialylation experiments because they are not yet in a homozygous stage.The high amount of sialylated glycoforms of 2G12 upon expressing proteins of the mammalian biosynthetic pathway points at a considerable degree of functional conservation between plant and mammalian cells. Moreover, the entire procedure did not interfere with IgG expression, which is remarkable in the light of the complexity of the process.As reported for A. thaliana transformed with GNE, NANS, and CMAS (13Castilho A. Pabst M. Leonard R. Veit C. Altmann F. Mach L. Glössl J. Strasser R. Steinkellner H. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), transient expression of these genes in N. benthamiana efficiently converted ManNAc-6-phosphate to Neu5Ac rather than to Neu5Ac-9-phosphate, suggesting the presence of a so far uncharacterized endogenous phosphatase acting on sialic acid-9-phosphate. On the other hand, although the presence of plant homologues for the CMP-Neu5Ac transporter and sialyltransferases has been suggested (24Bakker H. Routier F. Ashikov A. Neumann D. Bosch D. Gerardy-Schahn R. Carbohydr. Res. 2008; 343: 2148-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 25Takashima S. Abe T. Yoshida S. Kawahigashi H. Saito T. Tsuji S. Tsujimoto M. J. Biochem. 2006; 139: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), our experiments indicate that all required mammalian genes need to be expressed to achieve in planta protein sialylation. Notably, transient sialylation did not result in any obvious phenotype in the infiltrated leaves, indicating that at least certain plant tissues/organs can tolerate the incorporation of highly charged sialic acid into proteins. This is not surprising because N-glycans of total plant proteins derived from plants expressing all six genes of the sialylation pathway exhibited a relatively low amount of sialic acid (supplemental Fig. 1), in contrast to the efficient sialylation of the secreted mAb. The formation of disialylated mAb is remarkable because in human B-lymphocytes, α2,6-ST preferentially generates monosialylated Fc glycans (26Barb A.W. Brady E.K. Prestegard J.H. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9705-9707Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this light, the in planta sialylation of a recombinant protein is extremely high and significantly outperforms the sialylation ability of commonly used mammalian cell-based expression lines that generate low amounts of sialylated N-glycans (2Stadlmann J. Pabst M. Kolarich D. Kunert R. Altmann F. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The rarely used Nawalma cell line is an exception, generating mAbs with an increased sialylated Fc domain (27Stadlmann J. Weber A. Pabst M. Anderle H. Kunert R. Ehrlich H.J. Schwarz P.H. Altmann F. Proteomics. 2009; 9: 4143-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A substrate with more exposed N-glycans than Fcs would be expected to be furnished with higher amounts of disialylated N-glycans. This glycoform has indeed been generated for erythropoietin and lactotransferrin upon expression in glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris (28Hamilton S.R. Davidson R.C. Sethuraman N. Nett J.H. Jiang Y. Rios S. Bobrowicz P. Stadheim T.A. Li H. Choi B.K. Hopkins D. Wischnewski H. Roser J. Mitchell T. Strawbridge R.R. Hoopes J. Wildt S. Gerngross T.U. Science. 2006; 313: 1441-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The sialylation of lactotransferrin was performed in vitro for reasons that were not disclosed (29Choi B.K. Actor J.K. Rios S. d'Anjou M. Stadheim T.A. Warburton S. Giaccone E. Cukan M. Li H. Kull A. Sharkey N. Gollnick P. Kocieba M. Artym J. Zimecki M. Kruzel M.L. Wildt S. Glycoconj. J. 2008; 25: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).Here we show that sialylated 2G12 exhibits similar in vitro HIV neutralization potency to other glycoforms derived from plants and CHO cells, demonstrating full integrity of the protein. Notably, this neutralization experiment entirely relies on antigen-antibody binding and does not involve effector functions of the antibodies. Several studies have demonstrated the impact of proper Fc glycosylation for the biological activities of mAbs with the general agreement that mAbs lacking core α1,6-fucose exhibit a dramatically increased antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity activity (30Jefferis R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 31Raju T.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2008; 20: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In contrast, increased sialylation of IgGs results in reduced antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity activity because of a decreased binding to the FcγRIIIa receptor (4Scallon B.J. Tam S.H. McCarthy S.G. Cai A.N. Raju T.S. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 32Kaneko Y. Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Science. 2006; 313: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Fc sialylation of serum IgG is a major determinant in anti-inflammatory processes in autoimmune disorders (3Anthony R.M. Nimmerjahn F. Ashline D.J. Reinhold V.N. Paulson J.C. Ravetch J.V. Science. 2008; 320: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The rapid generation of highly α2,6-sialylated Fc as described in this work may substantially contribute to further elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms and may facilitate the generation of hypersialylated IgGs for the use as potent drugs to treat autoimmune diseases.This proof of concept study completes many years of intensive efforts to fully humanize plant glycosylation. Moreover, it is the first report demonstrating that a multicellular organism naturally lacking sialylated glycoconjugates can incorporate the entire biosynthetic pathway for protein sialylation. The lack of any phenotype in infiltrated leaves indicates the feasibility of generating plants stably expressing the entire pathway. Recent advances in multigene delivery (33Dafny-Yelin M. Tzfira T. Plant Physiol. 2007; 145: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) should allow the efficient generation of such plants to accomplish in planta sialylation in the future. The availability of such lines, together with recently generated glyco-engineered mutants displaying human-type glycosylation of great uniformity (9Strasser R. Stadlmann J. Schähs M. Stiegler G. Quendler H. Mach L. Glössl J. Weterings K. Pabst M. Steinkellner H. Plant Biotechnol. J. 2008; 6: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 10Strasser R. Castilho A. Stadlmann J. Kunert R.

In case whole plants would not tolerate protein sialylation during their complete developmental process, one of the six genes could be transiently expressed together with the protein of interest. Another alternative to this hurdle would be the use of tissue-specific or inducible promoters to specifically turn on protein sialylation in leaves.Glycoengineered plants in combination with newly developed plant virus-based transient expression systems, allowing the generation of a virtually unlimited number of different proteins at high amounts within 1 week after DNA construct delivery (6Gleba Y. Klimyuk V. Marillonnet S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2007; 18: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 34Sainsbury F. Lomonossoff G.P. Plant Physiol. 2008; 148: 1212-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), provide a considerable advantage over existing glyco-modified expression platforms, including yeast and mammalian cells. Besides the importance of this work in biotechnological applications, it may serve as a model for the manipulation of complex metabolic pathways into plants for the generation of varieties with new traits. IntroductionThe outstanding specificity of therapeutic glycoproteins places them among the fastest growing class of pharmaceutical products. Many of these drugs need terminal sialylation, the final and most complex step of human N-glycosylation, for optimal therapeutic potency. Therefore manufacturing is currently restricted to mammalian cell-based systems that are able to perform this important posttranslational modification, although with major limitations. The naturally present glycosylation repertoire of mammalian host cells promotes the generation of a number of different terminal structures and thus leads to heterogeneous glycosylation. Moreover, these modifications may differ from the authentic human glycosylation. For example, CHO 4The abbreviations used are: CHOChinese hamster ovaryGalTβ1,4-galactosyltransferaseST-GalTmodified β1,4-galactosyltransferaseSTα2,6-sialyltransferaseCMASCMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetaseNANSN-acetylneuraminic acid phosphate synthaseGNEUDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinaseCSTCMP-Neu5Ac transportermAbmonoclonal antibodyHIVhuman immunodeficiency virusGFPgreen fluorescent proteinRubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseWTwild typeMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidMSmass spectrometryMS/MStandem MSLCliquid chromatographyESIelectrospray mass ionizationTOFtime-of-flight. cells, widely used for the expression of recombinant glycoproteins, do not naturally produce human type α2,6-sialylation. These shortcomings in many cases lead to drugs with reduced biological potency, of which recombinant hormones such as human erythropoietin and interferons are prominent examples (1Bork K. Horstkorte R. Weidemann W. J. Pharm. Sci. 2009; 98: 3499-3508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, about 10% of the N-glycans in the Fc region of human serum IgG is sialylated (2Stadlmann J. Pabst M. Kolarich D. Kunert R. Altmann F. Proteomics. 2008; 8: 2858-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Although the anti-inflammatory effects of sialylated IgG have recently been demonstrated (3Anthony R.M. Nimmerjahn F. Ashline D.J. Reinhold V.N. Paulson J.C. Ravetch J.V. Science. 2008; 320: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), very little information on the impact of this common modification at the molecular level is available (4Scallon B.J. Tam S.H. McCarthy S.G. Cai A.N. Raju T.S. Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 1524-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). This explains the general interest in novel expression hosts and strategies to engineer glycosylation not only to increase the value of therapeutic proteins but also to better understand the role of glycosylation in general and sialylation in particular in fundamental biological processes.Plants are considered an attractive alternative expression platform for therapeutic human glycoproteins because they are cost-effective, highly scalable, free from human pathogens, and, importantly, can carry out complex N-glycosylation (5Stoger E. Ma J.K. Fischer R. Christou P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2005; 16: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 6Gleba Y. Klimyuk V. Marillonnet S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2007; 18: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In addition, plants glycosylate proteins with considerable uniformity, which may provide an advantage over mammalian-based expression systems. However, plants lack sialylated N-glycans, which restrict their utility as a versatile production platform. Recent studies have shown that the plant N-glycosylation pathway can be modified toward human-type glycosylation (7Cox K.M. Sterling J.D. Regan J.T. Gasdaska J.R. Frantz K.K. Peele C.G. Black A. Passmore D. Moldovan-Loomis C. Srinivasan M. Cuison S. Cardarelli P.M. Dickey L.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 8Schuster M. Jost W. Mudde G.C.

Elimination of plant-specific glycosylation in our laboratory and by others has resulted in the generation of plant lines (e.g. ΔXT/FT) that produce therapeutically relevant proteins carrying a human-like glycosylation profile (GnGn structures). Importantly, monoclonal antibodies produced in such lines exhibited enhanced effector functions (7Cox K.M. Sterling J.D. Regan J.T. Gasdaska J.R. Frantz K.K. Peele C.G. Black A. Passmore D. Moldovan-Loomis C. Srinivasan M. Cuison S. Cardarelli P.M. Dickey L.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 8Schuster M. Jost W. Mudde G.C. Wiederkum S.

Mach L. Glössl J. Weterings K. Pabst M. Steinkellner H. Plant Biotechnol. J. 2008; 6: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated recently that by overexpressing a modified version of the human β1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT), plant N-glycans can be extended with β1,4-linked galactose at great uniformity (10Strasser R. Castilho A. Stadlmann J. Kunert R. Quendler H. Gattinger P. Jez J. Rademacher T. Altmann F. Mach L. Steinkellner H. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 20479-20485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these structures serve as acceptor substrates for subsequent terminal sialylation. However, sialylation is particularly difficult to accomplish even in the presence of β1,4-galactosylated structures because plants lack some further essential prerequisites: (i) the biosynthetic capability to produce the sugar nucleotide precursor CMP-sialic acid, specifically CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac); (ii) a transporter that delivers CMP-sialic acid into the Golgi in sufficient amounts; and (iii) a sialyltransferase (ST) to transfer sialic acid from CMP-Neu5Ac to terminal galactose on the nascent glycoprotein. Moreover, these proteins and their substrates must work in a highly coordinated fashion at different stages of the pathway, and thus organelle-specific targeting of several components is required to enable proper protein sialylation (see Fig. 1). Initial attempts to introduce Neu5Ac residues into plant N-glycans have resulted in the expression of some of these proteins in plants (11Wee E.G. Sherrier D.J. Prime T.A. Dupree P. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12Misaki R. Fujiyama K. Seki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 1184-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and recent progress in our laboratory allowed the synthesis of the sugar nucleotide CMP-Neu5Ac from endogenous metabolites by the simultaneous overexpression of three mammalian enzymes in Arabidopsis thaliana (13Castilho A. Pabst M. Leonard R. Veit C. Altmann F. Mach L. Glössl J. Strasser R. Steinkellner H. Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, in planta protein sialylation has not yet been achieved.In this study, we aimed to achieve in planta sialylation in Nicotiana benthamiana, a tobacco-related plant species particularly well suited for recombinant protein expression (14Giritch A. Marillonnet S. Engler C. van Eldik G. Botterman J. Klimyuk V. Gleba Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14701-14706Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Six mammalian proteins comprising the sialic acid pathway were co-expressed together with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) in N. benthamiana wild type (WT) and glycosylation mutant plants thereof. Purified mAbs were subjected to glycosylation analyses and tested for functional integrity."

https://openalex.org/W2070859810,"Studies of post-translational modification by beta-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) are hampered by a lack of efficient tools such as O-GlcNAc-specific antibodies that can be used for detection, isolation and site localization. We have obtained a large panel of O-GlcNAc-specific IgG monoclonal antibodies having a broad spectrum of binding partners by combining three-component immunogen methodology with hybridoma technology. Immunoprecipitation followed by large-scale shotgun proteomics led to the identification of more than 200 mammalian O-GlcNAc-modified proteins, including a large number of new glycoproteins. A substantial number of the glycoproteins were enriched by only one of the antibodies. This observation, combined with the results of inhibition ELISAs, suggests that the antibodies, in addition to their O-GlcNAc dependence, also appear to have different but overlapping local peptide determinants. The monoclonal antibodies made it possible to delineate differentially modified proteins of liver in response to trauma-hemorrhage and resuscitation in a rat model."
https://openalex.org/W2008402427,"New chemotherapeutics are urgently required to control the tuberculosis pandemic. We describe a new pathway from trehalose to alpha-glucan in Mycobacterium tuberculosis comprising four enzymatic steps mediated by TreS, Pep2, GlgE (which has been identified as a maltosyltransferase that uses maltose 1-phosphate) and GlgB. Using traditional and chemical reverse genetics, we show that GlgE inactivation causes rapid death of M. tuberculosis in vitro and in mice through a self-poisoning accumulation of maltose 1-phosphate. Poisoning elicits pleiotropic phosphosugar-induced stress responses promoted by a self-amplifying feedback loop where trehalose-forming enzymes are upregulated. Moreover, the pathway from trehalose to alpha-glucan exhibited a synthetic lethal interaction with the glucosyltransferase Rv3032, which is involved in biosynthesis of polymethylated alpha-glucans, because key enzymes in each pathway could not be simultaneously inactivated. The unique combination of maltose 1-phosphate toxicity and gene essentiality within a synthetic lethal pathway validates GlgE as a distinct potential drug target that exploits new synergistic mechanisms to induce death in M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2061943156,"Induction of type I interferons by the transcription factor IRF3 is essential in the initiation of antiviral innate immunity. Activation of IRF3 requires C-terminal phosphorylation by the upstream kinases TBK1-IKKi, where IRF3 phosphorylation promotes dimerization, and subsequent nuclear translocation to the IFNβ promoter. Recent studies have described the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 as a negative regulator of IRF3 signaling by associating with TBK1-IKKi; however, the regulatory mechanism of A20 inhibition remains unclear. Here we describe the adaptor protein, TAX1BP1, as a key regulator of A20 function in terminating signaling to IRF3. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in TAX1BP1 displayed increased amounts of IFNβ production upon viral challenge compared with WT MEFs. TAX1BP1 inhibited virus-mediated activation of IRF3 at the level of TBK1-IKKi. TAX1BP1 and A20 blocked antiviral signaling by disrupting Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1-IKKi independently of the A20 deubiquitination domain. Furthermore, TAX1BP1 was required for A20 effector function because A20 was defective for the targeting and inactivation of TBK1 and IKKi in Tax1bp1−/− MEFs. Additionally, we found the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF3 to play a critical role in promoting TBK1-IKKi ubiquitination. Collectively, our results demonstrate TBK1-IKKi to be novel substrates for A20 and further identify a novel mechanism whereby A20 and TAX1BP1 restrict antiviral signaling by disrupting a TRAF3-TBK1-IKKi signaling complex.

The hallmark of an innate immune response against virus infection is the induction of a rapid, nonspecific antiviral state that coordinates the rapid elimination of the virus and the activation of a secondary T-cell-mediated adaptive immune response (1Kawai T. Akira S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1143: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 2Hiscott J. Grandvaux N. Sharma S. Tenoever B.R. Servant M.J. Lin R. Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Nature. 2007; 449: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar). This fundamental aspect of innate antiviral immunity is mediated by type I interferons (IFNα and IFNβ), key cytokines produced in the course of a viral infection, which, upon secretion, engage the IFNαβ receptor on neighboring cells to activate a signaling cascade that culminates in the production of interferon-stimulated genes that collectively promote an antiviral state by blocking virus replication and spread (3Sadler A.J.

IFN production is tightly regulated to prevent persistent IFN production, which has been associated with a variety of immunological disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren syndrome (6Espinosa A.

During acute viral infection, double-stranded RNA is often generated during replicative cycles and serves as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern. These pathogen-associated molecular patterns are detected by pattern recognition receptors, which activate antiviral signaling cascades leading to IFN production (1Kawai T. Akira S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2008; 1143: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 2Hiscott J. Grandvaux N. Sharma S. Tenoever B.R. Servant M.J. Lin R. Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Two major classes of pattern recognition receptors have been described for detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from viral nucleic acids: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2The abbreviations used are: TLRToll-like receptorDUBdeubiquitinationlucluciferaseIKKIκB kinase(s)MEFmouse embryo fibroblastGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininUbubiquitinELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayIPimmunoprecipitationIFNinterferonsiRNAsmall interfering RNA. and the Rig-I-like helicases. TLRs are membrane-bound and are found on the cell surface or in endosomal compartments. Recognition of double-stranded RNA by TLR3 results in the recruitment of the adaptor molecule TRIF, leading to NF-κB activation via RIP1/TRAF6-mediated activation of the canonical IκB kinases (IKK) and IRF3 activation via TRAF3-mediated activation of the TBK1-IKKi kinases. The Rig-I-like helicases are cytoplasmic sensors of viral nucleic acids. Upon double-stranded RNA detection, these receptors reconform to associate with IPS-1 (also known as MAVS, VISA, or Cardif) (9Kawai T. Takahashi K. Sato S. Coban C. Kumar H. Kato H. Ishii K.J.

In this report, we identify the A20-interacting protein, TAX1BP1 (Tax1-binding protein 1) (also known as T6BP or TXBP151) as a novel negative regulator of antiviral signaling pathways. A20 and TAX1BP1 cooperate to terminate antiviral signaling by antagonizing Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1 and IKKi. TAX1BP1 probably functions as an adaptor molecule for A20 because A20 is unable to interact with TBK1 or IKKi in the absence of TAX1BP1. Furthermore, our results suggest that A20 inhibits IRF3 signaling via a novel mechanism independent of A20 DUB function. 293T cells (ATCC), Tax1bp1−/− MEFs (23Shembade N. Harhaj N.S. Liebl D.J.

Whole cell lysates were generated by lysing cells in radioimmune precipitation buffer on ice, followed by centrifugation. Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting. For co-IPs, lysates were diluted 1:1 in radioimmune precipitation buffer and precleared with protein A-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Precleared lysates were further incubated at 4 °C with the indicated antibodies (1–3 μl): 2 h for antibodies against transfected proteins, overnight for antibodies against endogenous proteins. The protein-antibody complex was captured by the addition of protein A-agarose beads (40 μl) for 2h at 4 °C. Three washes with radioimmune precipitation buffer followed by the addition of 2× LSB allowed for the bound proteins to be eluted. Detection of TBK1-IKKi conjugated to ubiquitin was achieved by a similar co-IP method, where potential ubiquitinated TBK1-IKKi-interacting proteins were removed by stringent washes using radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1 m urea as described (26Shembade N.

MEFs were infected with either VSV-ΔM or Sendai virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. VSV-ΔM is a vesicular stomatitis virus containing a mutation in its matrix protein compromising its function in controlling cellular mRNA nuclear export (27Faria P.A. Chakraborty P. Levay A.

Our work and that of others has demonstrated that the NF-κB inhibitory function of A20 is dependent on TAX1BP1 (23Shembade N. Harhaj N.S. Liebl D.J. Harhaj E.W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3910-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28Iha H. Peloponese J.M. Verstrepen L. Zapart G. Ikeda F. Smith C.D. Starost M.F. Yedavalli V. Heyninck K. Dikic I. Beyaert R. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TAX1BP1-deficient MEFs display a similar phenotype to A20-deficient MEFs with respect to NF-κB activation, suggesting a cooperative role between A20 and TAX1BP1 (23Shembade N. Harhaj N.S. Liebl D.J. Harhaj E.W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3910-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28Iha H. Peloponese J.M. Verstrepen L. Zapart G. Ikeda F. Smith C.D. Starost M.F.

Science. 2000; 289: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Because A20 has been shown to block signaling to IRF3, we sought to determine if TAX1BP1 could similarly inhibit IRF3. Indeed, reporter assays evaluating IFNβ promoter activation in 293T cells revealed that expression of TAX1BP1 potently blocked IFNβ activation mediated by virus infection (supplemental Fig. 1A). In addition to the production of type I interferons, virus infection also triggers the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, many of which are regulated by NF-κB transcription factors. To determine if TAX1BP1 regulated virus-mediated NF-κB activation, reporter assays measuring NF-κB activity were also performed. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1B, overexpression of TAX1BP1 blocked virus-mediated activation of NF-κB. To determine whether TAX1BP1 inhibition of IFNβ was specific to virus infection, we examined other agonists capable of eliciting IRF3 activation. Our results demonstrate that TAX1BP1 also blocked poly(I-C) and lipopolysaccharide-mediated activation of IFNβ (supplemental Fig. 1, C and D). To confirm the effects of TAX1BP1 on the negative regulation of virus-mediated activation of IRF3, reporter assays measuring the activity of the IFNβ promoter were performed using siRNAs targeting TAX1BP1. Efficient knockdown of endogenous TAX1BP1 was confirmed by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. 1E). Knockdown of TAX1BP1 by siRNA enhanced virus-mediated activation of IFNβ (supplemental Fig. 1F). To further confirm the role of TAX1BP1 in blocking IRF3, IFN activation was measured in cells lacking TAX1BP1. Tax1bp1−/− MEFs exhibited enhanced levels of IFNβ promoter activation after virus infection, poly(I-C) treatment, or lipopolysaccharide treatment (Fig. 1, A–C). Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of TAX1BP1 were specific toward NF-κB and IRF3 transcription factors because NFAT activation was not inhibited by TAX1BP1 (supplemental Fig. 1G). To corroborate our findings that TAX1BP1 is a negative regulator of IRF3, IFNβ protein production was evaluated by ELISA in MEFs lacking TAX1BP1. Upon virus infection or poly(I-C) transfection, Tax1bp1−/− MEFs exhibited enhanced production of IFNβ compared with WT MEFs (Fig. 1D). To confirm that the increased production of IFNβ in Tax1bp1−/− MEFs was due specifically to a loss of TAX1BP1, Tax1bp1−/− MEFs were reconstituted with TAX1BP1 and evaluated for IFNβ production following virus infection. Knock-out MEFs reconstituted with TAX1BP1 were able to suppress virus-mediated production of IFNβ, indicating that the inhibition of IRF3 was indeed due to TAX1BP1 (supplemental Fig. 1H). Activation of IRF3 is mediated by its phosphorylation and subsequent dimerization. To determine if TAX1BP1 blocked IFNβ production by inhibiting IRF3 dimerization, we performed a native PAGE dimerization assay. TAX1BP1 expression inhibited IRF3 dimerization (Fig. 1E) and phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. 1I). Furthermore, knockdown of TAX1BP1 via siRNA enhanced IRF3 dimerization (supplemental Fig. 1J). Clearly, TAX1BP1 functions as a negative regulator of IFNβ. Next, we overexpressed key antiviral signaling molecules to determine where TAX1BP1 functions to block IFNβ. Rig-I and MDA5 are cytoplasmic sensors of viral nucleic acid that both contain RNA binding domains and CARD domains. Overexpression of the Rig-I CARD domain (ΔRig-I) potently activated the IFNβ reporter and was significantly blocked by TAX1BP1 (Fig. 2A). Consistently, ΔRig-I enhanced the activation of the IFNβ promoter in cells expressing TAX1BP1 siRNA (supplemental Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in TAX1BP1-deficient MEFs (supplemental Fig. 2B). Furthermore, reconstitution of TAX1BP1 in Tax1bp1−/− MEFs restored the suppression of ΔRig-I mediated activation of IFN (supplemental Fig. 2C). TAX1BP1 also blocked MDA5-mediated IFNβ activation (Fig. 2B). Both Rig-I and MDA5, via their N-terminal CARD domains, interact with IPS-1 to transduce signals to IRF3 and NF-κB. Overexpression of TAX1BP1 blocked IPS-1-mediated IRF3 (Fig. 2C) and NF-κB activation (Fig. 2D). Consistently, siRNA-mediated knockdown of TAX1BP1 further enhanced IPS-1-mediated activation of IRF3 (supplemental Fig. 2A). Next, we examined the effect of TAX1BP1 on TBK1-IKKi-mediated activation of IFNβ. TAX1BP1 overexpression blocked activation of the IFNβ reporter by TBK1-IKKi (Fig. 2, E and F) but not by a constitutively activated form of IRF3 (IRF3 SA) (Fig. 2G). Knockdown of TAX1BP1 by siRNA yielded a more pronounced activation of the IFNβ reporter in response to IKKi (Fig. 2H) or TBK1 (supplemental Fig. 2A) overexpression. TAX1BP1 also inhibited TBK1 activation of an interferon-stimulated response element promoter, recapitulating that TAX1BP1 is indeed a negative regulator of IFN (supplemental Fig. 2D). TLR3 and TLR4 activate IRF3 and NF-κB pathways via the adaptor TRIF. Overexpression of TAX1BP1 blocked TRIF-mediated IRF3 (supplemental Fig. 2E) and NF-κB activation (supplemental Fig. 2F). Conversely, knockdown of TAX1BP1 by siRNA resulted in enhanced TRIF-mediated IFNβ activation (supplemental Fig. 2A). As expected, A20 overexpression blocked IKKi-mediated activation of IRF3 (supplemental Fig. 2G), whereas A20 depletion resulted in enhanced IKKi-mediated IFNβ activation (supplemental Fig. 2H). Together, these results suggest that TAX1BP1 inhibits antiviral signaling upstream of IRF3, at the level of TBK1-IKKi. Previous studies have indicated that A20 also inhibits IRF3 activation by targeting TBK1-IKKi (21Saitoh T. Yamamoto M. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Nakanishi M. Fujita T. Akira S. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, TAX1BP1 and A20 may cooperate to block virus-mediated activation of IRF3. Because TAX1BP1 blocked signaling to the IFNβ promoter at the level of TBK1-IKKi, we next examined if TAX1BP1 interacted with these kinases. Co-IP experiments were performed in 293T cells transfected with epitope-tagged constructs of TAX1BP1, IKKi, and TBK1. As shown in Fig. 3A, TAX1BP1 interacted with both IKKi and TBK1. The interaction between TAX1BP1 and IKKi or TBK1 was confirmed by co-IPs using endogenous proteins. TAX1BP1 interaction with IKKi was entirely dependent upon virus infection (Fig. 3B). Low levels of TAX1BP1 were found to be persistently associated with TBK1, although the interactions were substantially increased upon virus infection (supplemental Fig. 3A). These results are similar to published data that demonstrated an A20 interaction with TBK1-IKKi upon overexpression (21Saitoh T. Yamamoto M. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Nakanishi M. Fujita T. Akira S. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and are consistent with a recent screen identifying TBK1 as an A20-interacting protein (30Sowa M.E. Bennett E.J. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Cell. 2009; 138: 389-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated that A20 requires TAX1BP1 to target and inactivate specific NF-κB regulatory proteins, including RIP1 and TRAF6 (23Shembade N. Harhaj N.S. Liebl D.J. Harhaj E.W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3910-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28Iha H. Peloponese J.M. Verstrepen L. Zapart G. Ikeda F. Smith C.D. Starost M.F. Yedavalli V. Heyninck K. Dikic I. Beyaert R. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To assess whether A20 required TAX1BP1 to target IKKi or TBK1 for inactivation, we analyzed IKKi/TBK1-A20 interactions in Tax1bp1−/− MEFs. A20 interacted with IKKi in response to virus infection in control MEFs; however, in the absence of TAX1BP1, the IKKi-A20 interaction was lost (Fig. 3C). In addition, A20 interacted with TBK1 following poly(I-C) treatment in control MEFs but not in Tax1bp1−/− MEFs (supplemental Fig. 3B). Because TAX1BP1 was clearly required for the recruitment of A20 to IKKi and TBK1, we hypothesized that TAX1BP1 was essential for A20 to terminate antiviral signaling. Thus, we performed IFNβ reporter assays to determine if A20 required TAX1BP1 to exert its inhibitory function. As shown in Fig. 3D, A20 effectively blocked IKKi-mediated activation of IRF3 in the presence of control siRNA but not TAX1BP1 siRNA. Furthermore, A20-mediated inhibition of the IFNβ reporter in response to virus activation was impaired in TAX1BP1-deficient MEFs (Fig. 3E). Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that TAX1BP1 recruits the E3 ligases Itch and RNF11 via two C-terminal zinc finger domains and associated PPXY motifs to terminate NF-κB signaling (25Shembade N. Harhaj N.S. Parvatiyar K. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Matesic L.E. Harhaj E.W. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 26Shembade N. Parvatiyar K. Harhaj N.S. Harhaj E.W. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To determine if TAX1BP1 required its two zinc fingers or PPXY motifs to inhibit IRF3 activation, Tax1bp1−/− MEFs were reconstituted with either wild-type TAX1BP1 or TAX1BP1 containing point mutations in the zinc fingers or PPXY motifs. TAX1BP1 containing point mutations in either of its PPXY motifs or both zinc fingers could not suppress virus-mediated activation of an IFNβ reporter (supplemental Fig. 3C). Saitoh et al. (21Saitoh T. Yamamoto M. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Nakanishi M. Fujita T. Akira S. Yamamoto N. Yamaoka S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1507-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have published that A20 inhibits IFNβ by targeting TBK1-IKKi; however, the mechanism of inhibition remains to be determined. A20 has been proposed to function as a ubiquitin-editing enzyme for RIP1 by cleaving Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains and adding Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains, ultimately resulting in the termination of NF-κB signaling (31Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M.

Recent studies have also indicated that TBK1 and IKKi undergo polyubiquitination, which has been proposed to promote IRF3 activation (33Friedman C.S. O'Donnell M.A. Legarda-Addison D. Ng A. Cárdenas W.B. Yount J.S. Moran T.M. Basler C.F. Komuro A. Horvath C.M. Xavier R. Ting A.T. EMBO Rep. 2008; 9: 930-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 34Wang C. Chen T. Zhang J. Yang M. Li N. Xu X. Cao X. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 744-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because A20 interacted with TBK1-IKKi, we next examined if TBK1-IKKi polyubiquitination was modulated by A20. Both TBK1 (Fig. 4A) and IKKi (supplemental Fig. 4A) when overexpressed were clearly polyubiquitinated via Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains. Interestingly, both wild-type A20 and an A20 DUB mutant (C103A) inhibited TBK1 and IKKi Lys63-linked polyubiquitination. However, an A20 deletion mutant (residues 1–367) lacking all of its C-terminal zinc fingers was unable to inhibit Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1 (Fig. 4A) and IKKi (supplemental Fig. 4A). Similar to A20, TAX1BP1 also inhibited IKKi polyubiquitination (Fig. 4B). In agreement with the above data, knockdown of TAX1BP1 using siRNA yielded enhanced IKKi polyubiquitination (Fig. 4C). To further corroborate the siRNA results, we evaluated endogenous levels of Lys63-specific linked ubiquitin chains conjugated onto TBK1 or IKKi in Tax1bp1−/− MEFs. Consistent with the above results, Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of endogenous TBK1 (Fig. 4D, compare lane 1 versus lane 3) or IKKi (supplemental Fig. 4B, compare lane 1 versus lane 3) was enhanced in MEFs lacking TAX1BP1. To gain better insight into the functional relevance of Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1-IKKi, we evaluated the effect of Lys63-linked ubiquitin overexpression in TBK1-mediated activation of IFNβ.

Here, we established gene expression profiles of 8 Hcy metabolic and 12 methylation enzymes in 20 human and 19 mouse tissues through bioinformatic analysis using expression sequence tag clone counts in tissue cDNA libraries. We analyzed correlations between gene expression, Hcy, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels, and SAM/SAH ratios in mouse tissues. Hcy metabolic and methylation enzymes were classified into two types. The expression of Type 1 enzymes positively correlated with tissue Hcy and SAH levels. These include cystathionine β-synthase, cystathionine-γ-lyase, paraxonase 1, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, betaine:homocysteine methyltransferase, methionine adenosyl-transferase, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferases and glycine N-methyltransferase. Type 2 enzyme expressions correlate with neither tissue Hcy nor SAH levels. These include SAH hydrolase, methionyl-tRNA synthase, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate:Hcy methyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, DNA methyltransferase 1/3a, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferases, and histone-lysine N-methyltransferase.

Glioblastoma spheroid cultures are enriched in tumor-initiating cells, and provide a model to test new treatment options in vitro. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of response to exposure to differentiation-promoting conditions in such cultures. Microarray analyses of five independent cultures showed that after induction of differentiation, inhibitors of transforming growth factor-β/bone morphogenetic protein, Wnt/β-catenin and IGF signaling were upregulated, whereas expression of several microRNAs decreased, particularly that of the miR-17-92 cluster. In primary astrocytic gliomas (n=82), expression of several members of miR-17-92 was significantly higher relative to those of normal brain (n=8) and significantly increased with tumor grade progression (P<0.05). A high-level amplification of the miR-17-92 locus was detected in one glioblastoma specimen. Transfection of inhibitors of miR-17-92 induced increased apoptosis and decreased cell proliferation in glioblastoma spheroids. Mir-17-92 inhibition was also associated with increased messenger RNA (mRNA) and/or protein expression of CDKN1A, E2F1, PTEN and CTGF. The CTGF gene was shown to be a target of miR-17-92 in glioblastoma spheroids by luciferase reporter assays. Our results suggest that miR-17-92 and its target CTGF mediate effects of differentiation-promoting treatment on glioblastoma cells through multiple regulatory pathways."

Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a large number of major loci, with many associations shared between various autoimmune diseases. These associations highlight key roles for lymphocyte activation and prioritize specific cytokine pathways and mechanisms of host-microbe recognition. Despite success in identifying loci, comprehensive models of disease pathogenesis are currently lacking. Future efforts comparing association patterns between autoimmune diseases may be particularly illustrative. New genomic technologies applied to classic genetic studies involving twins, early onset cases, and phenotypic extremes may provide key insights into developmental and gene-environment interactions in autoimmunity."

Here we described another protein kinase, CK1, whose phosphorylation of Snail is required for the subsequent GSK3β phosphorylation. Specific inhibition or depletion of CK1ɛ inhibits the phosphorylation and degradation of Snail and promotes cell migration, suggesting a central role of CK1ɛ in the EMT process. Furthermore, our study uncovered distinct roles and steps of Snail phosphorylation by CK1ɛ and GSK3β.

The M2 receptor was fused at the N terminus to enhanced green or yellow fluorescent protein and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Emission spectra were analyzed by spectral deconvolution, and apparent efficiencies were estimated by donor-dequenching and acceptor-sensitized emission at different ratios of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-M2 receptor to enhanced green fluorescent protein-M2 receptor. The data were interpreted in terms of a model that considers all combinations of donor and acceptor within a specified oligomer to obtain fitted values of E as follows: n = 2, 0.495 ± 0.019; n = 4, 0.202 ± 0.010; n = 6, 0.128 ± 0.006; n = 8, 0.093 ± 0.005. The pairwise FRET efficiency determined independently by fluorescence lifetime imaging was 0.20–0.24, identifying the M2 receptor as a tetramer. The strategy described here yields an explicit estimate of oligomeric size on the basis of fluorescence properties alone. Its broader application could resolve the general question of whether G protein-coupled receptors exist as dimers or larger oligomers. The size of an oligomer has functional implications, and such information can be expected to contribute to an understanding of the signaling process. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), measured by fluorescence intensity-based microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging, has been used to estimate the size of oligomers formed by the M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor. The approach is based on the relationship between the apparent FRET efficiency within an oligomer of specified size (n) and the pairwise FRET efficiency between a single donor and a single acceptor (E). The M2 receptor was fused at the N terminus to enhanced green or yellow fluorescent protein and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.

IntroductionMuch evidence now indicates that G protein-coupled receptors can exist as oligomers (1Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Among the many questions prompted by the emergence of such structures is that of oligomeric size. Although commonly referred to as dimers, oligomers of GPCRs have been detected most often by means of coimmunoprecipitation or resonance energy transfer (3Harrison C. van der Graaf P.H. J. Pharmacol. Toxicol. Methods. 2006; 54: 26-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As typically applied, neither technique can distinguish dimers from larger oligomers. The latter have been identified on the basis of their electrophoretic mobility (reviewed in Ref. 4Ma A.W. Redka D.S. Pisterzi L.F. Angers S. Wells J.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7907-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but the composition of the bands may be unclear, and the size under the conditions of electrophoresis may have little in common with that in the membrane. Larger oligomers also have been identified by approaches in which detection requires the colocalization of three or four proteins, each bearing a different tag (5Park P.S. Wells J.W. J.

Measurements of BRET at different ratios of acceptor to donor have pointed to dimers of the melatonin receptor (12Ayoub M.A. Couturier C. Lucas-Meunier E. Angers S. Fossier P. Bouvier M. Jockers R.

Armitage J.P. Watts A. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 964-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In each case, however, the data were analyzed in terms of a model developed for gramicidin and based on the notion of a dynamic equilibrium between the monomeric and oligomeric states (16Veatch W. Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 113: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Measurements of the efficiency at which differently tagged adducts were coimmunoprecipitated from extracts of coinfected Sf9 cells suggested that the M2 muscarinic receptor is at least a trimer (5Park P.S. Wells J.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but the value depended upon properties that were difficult to measure or control.In this study, we introduce a general method for the determination of oligomeric size from the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, as estimated from the spectral properties and fluorescence lifetimes. The theory underlying the spectral analyses has been described previously (17Raicu V. J. Biol. Phys. 2007; 33: 109-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and is based on the following two considerations: first, the apparent FRET efficiency is determined by the size of the oligomer and its complement of donors and acceptors; second, the pairwise FRET efficiency, i.e. the efficiency for the transfer of energy from a single donor to a single acceptor, can be inferred from the apparent efficiency by means of a model in which all pathways for FRET are enumerated for all combinations of donor and acceptor in an oligomer of specified size.This approach has been applied to fluorophore-tagged M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptors expressed in CHO cells. The data indicate that the receptor exists as a tetramer, as suggested previously on the basis of electrophoretic mobility (4Ma A.W. Redka D.S. Pisterzi L.F. Angers S. Wells J.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7907-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 5Park P.S. Wells J.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Wreggett K.A.

Similar studies on other GPCRs can be expected to reveal the degree of oligomeric diversity within the rhodopsin-like subgroup and across the family at large. The approach also can be extended from live cells to more controlled systems, where it may help to distinguish functional properties that are intrinsic to monomers from those that emerge as a consequence of oligomerization. Such information has implications for our understanding of the mechanistic and molecular factors that underlie signaling. A preliminary report of this work has appeared elsewhere (21Pisterzi L.F. Jansma D.B. Georgiou J. Woodside M.J. Chou J.T. Angers S. Raicu V. Wells J.W. Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 169aAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONFluorescence resonance energy transfer has been used to characterize oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor in the plasma membrane of CHO cells. The approach was based on two complementary procedures for measuring the FRET efficiency between a single donor and a single acceptor, in this case eGFP and eYFP. In the first, the apparent efficiency was estimated from the emission spectrum by means of donor-dequenching (Eappddq) and acceptor-sensitized emission (Eappase) at different ratios of eYFP-M2 to eGFP-M2; the pairwise FRET efficiency then was inferred in terms of a model that accounts for all combinatorial possibilities within an oligomer of specified size (n). In the second procedure, E or a close approximation thereof was estimated directly from fluorescence lifetimes. The spectral analyses delivered a set of essentially equivalent fits relating the pairwise efficiency and n, and the appropriate value of n was identified by the efficiency calculated from lifetimes.The oligomeric size that emerges from this approach depends upon the degree to which the donor is photobleached under the conditions used to bleach the acceptor. If eGFP is unaffected, the efficiency of 0.20 calculated from fluorescence lifetimes corresponds to a trimer according to the spectral analyses (Fig. 9B, inset). If the donor in cotransfected cells is bleached at the rate of eGFP-M2 expressed alone, the efficiency from lifetimes corresponds to a tetramer (Fig. 9D, inset). In neither case is the efficiency determined by FLIM consistent with that inferred for a dimer on the basis of the spectral analyses (Fig. 9). Were the fluorophores to adopt orientations that differ in their pairwise FRET efficiency and interconvert slowly on the time scale of the assays, static averaging over the entire population would cause the measured efficiency to be somewhat less than that obtained if all were in the optimal conformation. Because the magnitude of such an effect is likely to be comparable for both estimates of E, comparisons such as those in Fig. 9 would yield the same oligomeric size.In a previous study of coexpressed eGFP and eYFP, bleaching of the acceptor did not require irradiation at 514 nm; rather, the acquisition of successive spectra upon excitation at 476 nm was sufficient in itself to reduce the signal from eYFP (43Raicu, V., Jansma, D. B., Michalski, K., (2006) in Proceedings of SPIE, Imaging, Manipulation, and Analysis of Biomolecules, Cells, and Tissues IV (Farkas, D. L., Nicolau, D. V., Leif, R. C., eds) 60880A 60881–60880A 60889.Google Scholar). Emission from the donor was unaffected during the early steps but subsequently declined with bleaching of the acceptor. It was concluded that the donor is protected from photobleaching while engaged in FRET.In this study, the acceptor was photobleached by irradiation at 514 nm, which corresponds to λmax for the excitation of eYFP. If most of the acceptors are excited under such conditions, few will be in an electronic state to accept energy from the small fraction of donors that also are excited. The protection otherwise provided by FRET thereby is reduced, and the donor is susceptible to photobleaching. Donors within oligomers that were formed without acceptors or have lost acceptors through bleaching also will be vulnerable, and the latter population will increase with each successive round of irradiation at 514 nm. Similarly, donors in acceptor-deficient oligomers will be vulnerable to irradiation at 458 in the manner of those that were sensitive to irradiation at 476 nm (43Raicu, V., Jansma, D. B., Michalski, K., (2006) in Proceedings of SPIE, Imaging, Manipulation, and Analysis of Biomolecules, Cells, and Tissues IV (Farkas, D. L., Nicolau, D. V., Leif, R. C., eds) 60880A 60881–60880A 60889.Google Scholar). Results from a recent study in which eGFP- and eYFP-tagged constructs were examined under similar conditions also indicate that eGFP is sensitive to photobleaching at 514 nm (44Dinant C. van Royen M.E. Vermeulen W. Houtsmuller A.B. J. Microsc. 2008; 231: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).These considerations suggest that a population of donors coexpressed with acceptors will be photobleached at a rate similar to that measured in cells expressing eGFP-M2 alone. Among those FRET efficiencies that incorporate the correction for photobleaching of the donor (Table 1), the value of 0.202 agrees most closely with the efficiency of 0.20–0.24 determined by FLIM, identifying the oligomer as a tetramer. The measured values of Eappddq and Eappase differ markedly from the values computed according to the model with the pairwise efficiency taken as 0.20 and the value of n taken as either two or six (Fig. 9, C and D).Estimates of the pairwise efficiency obtained from spectral analyses and fluorescence lifetimes are determined by the physical properties of the fluorophores, and they are unaffected by variables that are inaccessible or difficult to measure. The process of spectral deconvolution that yields the values of Eapp and [A]T/[D]T required by Equations 10 and 11 pre-supposes only that the spectrum from a cotransfected cell is the sum of the spectra that would be obtained from cells transfected with eGFP-M2 or eYFP-M2 alone. Similarly, efficiencies calculated from fluorescence lifetimes are independent of the various factors that determine the amplitude of the signal.In this study, the dependence of apparent efficiency on the ratio of acceptor to donor was not in itself sufficient to define both the pairwise FRET efficiency and the size of the oligomer. That ambiguity was resolved by estimating the value of E independently from fluorescence lifetimes, but the model may be able to pinpoint a specific oligomeric size under some conditions. Simulations based on Equations 10 and 11 indicate that the effect of n on the predicted dependence of Eapp on [A]T/[D]T varies with the value of E. The differences are small at the values of E found for the M2 receptor (i.e. ≤50%), but they ought to be discernible at values near 80%. Efficiencies of that magnitude are not improbable; for example, the judicious placement of small fluorescent probes such as FlAsH and Texas Red can yield highly efficient FRET pairs (45Adams S.R. Campbell R.E. Gross L.A. Martin B.R. Walkup G.K. Yao Y. Llopis J. Tsien R.Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 6063-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar).It is assumed in Equations 10 and 11 that monomers are nonexistent and that all oligomers are of the same size. The first assumption is supported by the observation that the fit to Eappddq and Eappase is compromised when the fraction of receptors in the monomeric state exceeds zero (Equations 12 and 13), and it is consistent with reports that oligomerization is a prerequisite for transport to the plasma membrane (46Jordan B.A. Trapaidze N. Gomes I. Nivarthi R. Devi L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 343-348PubMed Google Scholar). The notion of oligomeric homogeneity remains untested, although it is consistent with other data as described below. It also is supported by internal consistency within the results of the present analyses. At each value of n, there is good agreement between the values of E obtained by donor-dequenching and acceptor-sensitized emission; moreover, the values of E when n is 4 are in good agreement with the efficiency estimated from lifetimes. If the oligomer serves a specific functional role, the required properties may depend upon a specific size that is achieved during biosynthesis and determined wholly or in part by factors intrinsic to a monomer (4Ma A.W. Redka D.S. Pisterzi L.F. Angers S. Wells J.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7907-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).The model also assumes that the distance between donor and acceptor is the same for all pairs within an oligomer of given size. This is likely to be true for a dimer and perhaps for a trimer, where structures can be envisaged in which all pathways for the transfer of energy are equivalent or nearly so. It cannot be true for a tetramer, where the simplest possible arrangement is a square or rhombus in which FRET could occur across the diagonal or along the side. In such a case, the value of 0.202 estimated for E in terms of Equations 10 and 11 is an average of the efficiencies for the transfer of energy along all pathways within the complex. Such averaging washes out information regarding the relative disposition of constituent protomers. Size is the parameter of interest here, however, and that information is available for tetramers and larger oligomers as long as the proportion of donors and acceptors obeys the binomial distribution. Similar averaging occurs in the estimation of τDA via FLIM, as described below and in the supplemental material. It follows that FRET efficiencies calculated from lifetimes can be compared with those inferred from the spectral data at all values of n.To examine the effect of averaging in the case of a tetramer, the value of E from Equations 10 and 11 was compared with the values of Es and Ed for the arbitrary distances that might exist in a square and a rhombus (supplemental Fig. S1, Equations S9 and S11). In the rhombus under consideration here, the short diagonal is equal in length to a side. It follows that there are proportionately fewer such pathways in a square, and the fitted value obtained for Es in a square (Es = 0.27, supplemental Equation S9) therefore exceeds that in a rhombus (Es = 0.24, supplemental Equation S11). Although the distance along a side is the same in both arrangements, the diagonal of a square is shorter than the long diagonal of a rhombus (supplemental Fig. S1); accordingly, the efficiency corresponding to FRET across the diagonal also is larger in a square (Ed = 0.044) than in a rhombus (Ed = 0.011). As expected, the two efficiencies based on arbitrary distances in either form of tetramer bracket the average efficiency from Equations 10 and 11. Neither value of Es approaches the fitted value of E for a dimer (i.e. 0.50, Table 1), in which the assumption of equal distances presumably is valid.A similar analysis of fluorescence decay in terms of arbitrary distances is precluded by the number of lifetimes predicted by the model. An approach analogous to that taken for the spectral data gives five linked lifetimes for the transfer of energy via FRET in a square and six such lifetimes in a rhombus (supplemental Table S3 and Equations S18 and S19). With the inclusion of τD and τA, an explicit description of the system would require a total of seven and eight lifetimes, respectively. Such a large number of exponential terms exceeds the capacity of the data and would seem to limit the degree to which oligomeric size can be assessed on the basis of lifetimes alone. An assessment of size also requires information on the ratio of acceptors to donors, which is not readily available from FLIM.The several values of τDA,j predicted for a tetramer (supplemental Equations S18 and S19) suggest that the measured values listed in Table 2 are weighted means. Although microscopic lifetimes cannot be extracted from the data, the known relationships among the different τDA,j and the expected occurrence of each in a square and a rhombus allow values to be calculated such that the weighted means equal those measured experimentally. Because the lifetimes for each pathway are known in a simulation, the efficiency can be calculated for FRET along a side of the tetramer (Es) and across the diagonal (Ed). If donors and acceptors are expressed at the same level, the calculated efficiencies for a square are 0.19–0.22 and 0.026–0.033, respectively; the corresponding efficiencies for a rhombus are 0.15–0.19 and 0.0066–0.0086 (supplemental Table S5). These values agree to at least a first approximation with those inferred from the spectral data for a square (Es = 0.27 and Ed = 0.044) and a rhombus (Es = 0.24 and Ed = 0.011), in accord with the agreement obtained when all distances are assumed to be equal (Fig. 5, C and D).Fusion of eGFP and eYFP at the N terminus allowed for control of the pH, which affects the spectral properties of the fluorophore (23Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). The modification had no discernible effect on transport of the receptor to the plasma membrane, as indicated by the localization of the fluorophore, its internalization in the presence of agonist, and its colocalization with a Cy3-conjugated antibody specific for an anti-eGFP antibody. There also was no discernible effect on functionality, including the ability to signal. The tag did not affect the binding of antagonists nor did it prevent agonist-initiated internalization, as noted above, or the activation of G proteins linked to the release of intracellular Ca2+. Similar additions to the N terminus of the M1 muscarinic receptor were without effect on the ligand-binding properties or the agonist-induced release of intracellular calcium in HEK 293 cells (22Weill C. Galzi J.L. Chasserot-Golaz S. Goeldner M. Ilien B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 791-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Fluorophore-tagged M2 receptors in CHO cells were expressed at levels comparable with those in native tissues. The estimated density of 0.88 × 106 receptors per cell is about one-half of the density reported for intact cardiomyocytes from rat atria. The latter value is 1.7 × 106 receptors per cell (47Pathak A. Smih F. Galinier M. Verwaerde P. Rouet P. Philip-Couderc P. Montastruc J.L. Senard J.M. Int. J. Obes. 2005; 29: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which may be an underestimate. It was determined from the binding of N-[3H]methylscopolamine, which presumably labeled only those receptors that were located at the plasma membrane. Also, N-[3H]methylscopolamine has been shown to exhibit, under some conditions, a shortfall in capacity that cannot be attributed to sites localized in a hydrophobic compartment (4Ma A.W. Redka D.S. Pisterzi L.F. Angers S. Wells J.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7907-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Park P.S. Sum C.S. Pawagi A.B. Wells J.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5588-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). If the capacity for [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate is stated relative to total protein, the present value of about 1.5 nmol/g compares favorably with values of 3–5 nmol/g that have been reported previously for the M2 receptor in sarcolemmal membranes (48Peterson G.L. Schimerlik M.I. Prep. Biochem. 1984; 14: 33-74PubMed Google Scholar, 49Mattera R. Pitts B.J. Entman M.L. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7410-7421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Sum C.S. Pyo N. Wells J.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 829-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These considerations suggest that the oligomeric status of the receptor in CHO cells is not an artifact of overexpression.No FRET was observed between eGFP-M2 and eYFP-trFz1, which was engineered to resemble eYFP-M2 with respect to the placement of the fluorophore. It follows that eGFP-M2 and eYFP-trFz1 do not interact at levels of expression that lead to FRET in the case of eGFP-M2 and eYFP-M2, although the possibility that eGFP-M2 and eYFP-trFz1 form a dark complex in which the dipole of eGFP is perpendicular to that of eYFP cannot be ruled out. The present result is consistent with reports that the M2 receptor does not coprecipitate with Frizzled-1 (51Kaykas A. Yang-Snyder J. Héroux M. Shah K.V. Bouvier M. Moon R.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or exhibit BRET when coexpressed with the Smoothened receptor, a homologue of Frizzled-1 (14Goin J.C. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5416-5425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter in the latter investigation (14Goin J.C. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5416-5425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and in the experiments described here. These results suggest that the association between eGFP-M2 and eYFP-M2 is specific; they argue against the alternative possibility of stochastic interactions and suggest that it is difficult to populate the membrane at a level sufficient for such effects. Dimerization via the fluorophore was prevented by the substitution of lysine for alanine at position 206 in all constructs (26Zacharias D.A. Violin J.D. Newton A.C. Tsien R.Y. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar).The present evidence for a tetramer is consistent with the results of earlier studies in which the oligomeric size of the M2 receptor has been measured directly or inferred from functional properties. Muscarinic receptors purified from porcine sarcolemma and examined by electrophoresis were found to migrate as a mixture of monomers and oligomers, including an apparent tetramer (18Wreggett K.A. Wells J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22488-22499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A complex containing c-Myc-, hemagglutinin-, and FLAG-tagged M2 receptors has been purified from triply infected Sf9 cells, and the amount of the tri-labeled species was sufficient to suggest that it was larger than a trimer (5Park P.S. Wells J.W. J. Neurochem. 2004; 90: 537-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). M2 receptors also can be purified from Sf9 cells as monomers that regroup almost exclusively as tetramers upon reconstitution in phospholipid vesicles (4Ma A.W. Redka D.S. Pisterzi L.F. Angers S. Wells J.W. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7907-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Functional studies on the M2 receptor in native preparations and after reconstitution as a tetramer have revealed noncompetitive effects in the binding of muscarinic antagonists, and the pattern can be described quantitatively in terms of cooperative interactions among at least four sites (4Ma A.W.

https://openalex.org/W2077567806,"Dendritic cells (DCs) express cell surface lectins that are potentially involved in the recognition, uptake, and presentation of glycosylated foreign substances. A unique calcium-type (C-type) lectin, the macrophage galactose (Gal)-type C-type lectin (MGL/CD301) expressed on DCs, is thought to participate in the recognition of molecules from both altered self and pathogens due to its monosaccharide specificity for Gal and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). Although mice have two MGL genes, Mgl1 and Mgl2, their distinct roles have not been previously explored. The present report characterizes the properties of MGL2 by examining its distribution and its role in antigen presentation by DCs. We generated an MGL2-specific monoclonal antibody and examined MGL2 expression in tissues by immunohistochemistry and in isolated cells by flow cytometry. The cells reactive with this antibody were shown to be a portion of MGL1-expressing cells, mostly conventional DCs. Internalization of soluble polyacrylamide polymers (PAA) with alpha-GalNAc residues (GalNAc-PAA) by bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) was mediated by MGL2, as revealed by a comparison of Mgl1(-/-) and Mgl2(-/-) BM-DCs with wild-type BM-DCs. Biotinylated GalNAc-PAA conjugated to streptavidin (SAv) was more efficiently presented to SAv-primed T cells by BM-DCs than beta-N-acetylglucosamine-PAA conjugated to SAv or SAv alone as shown by thymidine uptake and cytokine production. This is the first report that demonstrates the involvement of GalNAc residues in antigen uptake and presentation by DCs that lead to CD4(+) T cell activation."
https://openalex.org/W2147464758,"Novel therapeutic agents combined with innovative modes of delivery and non-invasive imaging of drug delivery, pharmacokinetics and efficacy are crucial in developing effective clinical anticancer therapies. In this study, we have created and characterized multiple novel variants of anti-angiogenic protein thrombospondin (aaTSP-1) that comprises unique regions of three type-I-repeats of TSP-1 and used engineered human neural stem cells (hNSC) to provide sustained on-site delivery of secretable aaTSP-1 to tumor-vasculature. We show that hNSC-aaTSP-1 has anti-angiogenic effect on human brain and dermal microvascular endothelial cells co-cultured with established glioma cells and CD133+ glioma-initiating cells. Using human glioma cells and hNSC engineered with different combinations of fluorescent and bioluminescent marker proteins and employing multi-modality imaging techniques, we show that aaTSP-1 targets the vascular-component of gliomas and a single administration of hNSC-aaTSP-1 markedly reduces tumor vessel-density that results in inhibition of tumor-progression and increased survival in mice bearing highly malignant human gliomas. We also show that therapeutic hNSC do not proliferate and remain in an un-differentiated state in the brains of glioma-bearing mice. This study provides a platform for accelerated development of future cell-based therapies for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1982719021,"Amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1) is a transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors and other transcription factors. AIB1 has an important role in malignancy of several cancers such as breast and prostate cancers. However, its involvement in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression remains unclear. Here, we found that AIB1 protein was overexpressed in 23 of 34 human HCC specimens (68%). Down-regulation of AIB1 reduced HCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, colony formation ability and tumorigenic potential in nude mice. These phenotypic changes caused by AIB1 knockdown correlated with increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1/Waf1) and decreased Akt activation and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and matrix metallopeptidase MMP-9. In agreement with these findings, clinical AIB1-positive HCC expressed higher levels of PCNA than AIB1-negative HCC. A positive correlation was established between the levels of AIB1 protein and PCNA protein in HCC, suggesting that AIB1 may contribute to HCC cell proliferation. In addition, MMP-9 expression in AIB1-postive HCC was significantly higher than that in AIB1-negative HCC, suggesting that AIB1-postive HCC may be more invasive. Collectively, our results show that overexpression of AIB1 promotes human HCC progression by enhancing cell proliferation and invasiveness. Therefore, AIB1 is a master regulator of human HCC growth and might be a useful molecular target for HCC prognosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2100028870,"The discovery of glycine conjugates of long-chain fatty acids (N-acyl glycines) in the brain and other non-neuronal tissues has led to the identification of an emerging class of bioactive lipids. The biological activities of N-acyl glycines include antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects, and activation of G-protein-coupled receptors. However, despite the fact that N-acyl glycines are emerging as a distinct lipid signaling family, pathways for their production are not fully elucidated. Here we report on the characterization of human glycine N-acyltransferase-like 2 (hGLYATL2), a member of a gene family of 4 putative glycine conjugating enzymes, and show that it synthesizes various N-acyl glycines. Recombinantly expressed hGLYATL2 efficiently conjugated oleoyl-CoA, arachidonoyl-CoA, and other medium- and long-chain acyl-CoAs to glycine. The enzyme was specific for glycine as an acceptor molecule, and preferentially produced N-oleoyl glycine. The hGLYATL2 enzyme is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and the mRNA shows highest expression in salivary gland and trachea, but is also detected in spinal cord and skin fibroblasts. The expression pattern and the identification of high levels of N-acyl glycines in skin and lung may indicate a role for N-acyl glycines in barrier function/immune response and the potential role of hGLYATL2 in this regard is discussed.—Waluk, D.

The structure of T. gondii AMA1 (TgAMA1) is the most complete of any AMA1 structure to date, with more than 97.5% of the ectodomain unambiguously modeled. Comparative sequence analysis reveals discrete segments of divergence in TgAMA1 that map to areas of established functional importance in AMA1 from Plasmodium vivax (PvAMA1) and Plasmodium falciparum (PfAMA1). Inspection of the TgAMA1 structure reveals a network of apical surface loops, reorganized in both size and chemistry relative to PvAMA1/PfAMA1, that appear to serve as structural filters restricting access to a central hydrophobic groove. The terminal portion of this groove is formed by an extended loop from DII that is 14 residues shorter in TgAMA1. A pair of tryptophan residues (Trp353 and Trp354) anchor the DII loop in the hydrophobic groove and frame a conserved tyrosine (Tyr230), forming a contiguous surface that may be critical for moving junction assembly. The minimalist DIII structure folds into a cystine knot that probably stabilizes and orients the bulk of the ectodmain without providing excess surface area to which invasion-inhibitory antibodies can be generated.

Here, we show that mammary epithelial disruption of ILK results in a profound block in mammary tumor induction. Consistent with these observations, inhibition of ILK function in ErbB2-expressing cells with small molecule inhibitor or RNA interference resulted in profound block in their in vitro invasive properties due to the induction of apoptotic cell death. The rare ILK-deficient tumors that eventually arose overcame this block in tumor induction by an upregulation of ErB3 phosphorylation. These observations provide direct evidence that ILK has a critical role in the initiation phase of ErbB2 tumor induction."
https://openalex.org/W1979027206,"Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a pleiotropic lipid second messenger in mammalian cells. We report here that extracellular PA acts as a leukocyte chemoattractant, as membrane-soluble dioleoyl-PA (DOPA) elicits actin polymerization and chemotaxis of human neutrophils and differentiated proleukemic HL-60 cells. We show that the mechanism for this involves the S6 kinase (S6K) signaling enzyme. Chemotaxis was inhibited >90% by the S6K inhibitors rapamycin and bisindolylmaleimide and by S6K1 silencing using double-stranded RNA. However, it was only moderately ( approximately 30%) inhibited by mTOR siRNA, indicating the presence of an mTOR-independent mechanism for S6K. Exogenous PA led to robust time- and dose-dependent increases in S6K enzymatic activity and Thr(421)/Ser(424) phosphorylation, further supporting a PA/S6K connection. We also investigated whether intracellular PA production affects cell migration. Overexpression of phospholipase D2 (PLD2) and, to a lesser extent, PLD1, resulted in elevation of both S6K activity and chemokinesis, whereas PLD silencing was inhibitory. Because the lipase-inactive PLD2 mutants K444R and K758R neither activated S6K nor induced chemotaxis, intracellular PA is needed for this form of cell migration. Lastly, we demonstrated a connection between extracellular and intracellular PA. Using an enhanced green fluorescent protein-derived PA sensor (pEGFP-Spo20PABD), we showed that exogenous PA or PA generated in situ by bacterial (Streptomyces chromofuscus) PLD enters the cell and accumulates in vesicle-like cytoplasmic structures. In summary, we report the discovery of PA as a leukocyte chemoattractant via cell entry and activation of S6K to mediate the cytoskeletal actin polymerization and leukocyte chemotaxis required for the immune function of these cells."

https://openalex.org/W2083447583,"STEAP4 is a plasma membrane metalloreductase involved in the transport of iron and copper. Recently, STEAP4 was implicated in promoting insulin sensitivity by acting in white adipose tissue to control the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6. Indeed, the loss of STEAP4 expression in mice leads to increased production of inflammatory cytokines in visceral white adipose tissue and systemic insulin resistance. In this study, we demonstrate that in mouse liver STEAP4 is produced at significant levels and that steap4 transcription is induced by interleukin 6. We further demonstrate that the steap4 gene is a direct target of phosphorylated STAT3 in mouse liver. In addition, hepatic STEAP4 expression is regulated by feeding and fasting, and obesity leads to the induction of STEAP4 expression in the liver. Interestingly, the regulation of STEAP4 in both feeding and fasting and the obese state appears to require the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha that may act in concert with STAT3 as they both bind to the proximal steap4 promoter in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest the transcriptional regulation of hepatic STEAP4 may play a critical role in the response to nutritional and inflammatory stress and contributes to the protective effect of STEAP4 in vivo."

CPT-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are considered a major cause of its tumoricidal activity, and it has been shown that CPT induces DNA damage signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases, including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated), ATR (ATM and Rad3-related), and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase). In addition, CPT causes DNA strand breaks mediated by transcription, although the downstream signaling events are less well characterized. In this study, we show that CPT-induced activation of ATM requires transcription. Mechanistically, transcription inhibition suppressed CPT-dependent activation of ATM and blocked recruitment of the DNA damage mediator p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) to DNA damage sites, whereas ATM inhibition abrogated CPT-induced G1/S and S phase checkpoints. Functional inactivation of ATM resulted in DNA replication-dependent hyperactivation of DNA-PK in CPT-treated cells and dramatic CPT hypersensitivity. On the other hand, simultaneous inhibition of ATM and DNA-PK partially restored CPT resistance, suggesting that activation of DNA-PK is proapoptotic in the absence of ATM. Correspondingly, comet assay and cell cycle synchronization experiments suggested that transcription collapse occurring as the result of CPT treatment are converted to frank double-strand breaks when ATM-deficient cells bypass the G1/S checkpoint.

Typically, glycine binding NR1 subunits co-assemble with glutamate binding NR2 subunits to form a functional receptor. Here we have used luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) investigations to establish the specific configuration in which these subunits assemble to form the functional tetramer and show that the dimer of dimers structure is formed by the NR1 subunits assembling diagonally to each other. The distances measured by LRET are consistent with the NMDA structure predicted based on cross-linking investigations and on the structure of the full-length α-amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor structure (1Sobolevsky A.I.

Additionally, the LRET distances between the NR1 and NR2A subunits within a dimer measured in the desensitized state of the receptor are longer than the distances in the previously published crystal structure of the isolated ligand binding domain of NR1-NR2A. Because the dimer interface in the isolated ligand binding domain crystallizes in the open channel structure, the longer LRET distances would be consistent with the decoupling of the dimer interface in the desensitized state.

The glutamate receptor family consists of three subtypes: kainate receptors, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, and NMDA receptors (2Hollmann M.

Although the overall topology is similar among the three subtypes of the glutamate receptors, the NMDA receptors differ in many ways from the AMPA and kainate receptor subtypes. Functionally, the NMDA receptors are highly permeable to calcium ions and exhibit voltage-dependent block by physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and act as a coincidence detector, permitting ion flow only upon depolarization of the receiving cell. Structurally, unlike the AMPA and kainate receptors that can form homomeric receptors, the NMDA receptors are obligate heteromeric receptors composed of homologous NR1, NR2, and/or NR3 subunits.

The structure of the isolated ligand binding domain of the NMDA receptor suggests that the tetrameric receptor has a dimer of dimer arrangement, with each dimer having one glycine binding subunit and one glutamate binding subunit (9Furukawa H. Singh S.K. Mancusso R. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 438: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The recent full-length structure of the AMPA receptor published while this manuscript was in review along with cross-linking data suggest that the dimers are arranged such that the NR1 subunits are diagonal to each other, as are the NR2 subunits (1Sobolevsky A.I. Rosconi M.P. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 462: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). Here we have obtained LRET-based distances between the subunits and show that the distances match the arrangement predicted based on the full-length AMPA receptor structure. Apart from the subunit arrangements, due to the limited number of structures available for the NMDA receptors, most of the insight into the mechanism of activation and desensitization has been based on the extensive structure-function investigations of the AMPA subtype. The mechanism based on these structures is that agonist binding induces cleft closure in the ligand binding domain, leading to channel opening, which causes stress on the transmembrane segments (9Furukawa H.

To relieve this stress, it is thought that the dimer interface decouples, which in turn results in channel closure (desensitization). The mechanism for desensitization in the AMPA receptors is based on the observation that stabilizing the dimer interface using either mutations or modulators such as cyclothiazide results in a stabilization of the open channel form (12Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E. Nature. 2002; 417: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). There is no direct structural evidence for the same because the structural studies of the isolated ligand binding domain lack the transmembrane segments and hence do not have the strain that drives the decoupling. A “desensitized-like” structure was obtained by artificially decoupling the dimer interface by introducing a cysteine at position 729 or 725, which formed a disulfide bond formation deep in the interface (18Armstrong N. Jasti J. Beich-Frandsen M. Gouaux E. Cell. 2006; 127: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the case of the NMDA receptors, stabilization of the dimer interface through disulfide bonds slows the rate of desensitization; however, it does not block desensitization, as seen in the AMPA receptors. There is currently one structure of the NR1-NR2A dimer, and because it lacks the transmembrane domain, this is expected to be the structure of the open channel form of the receptor. Hence there is no direct structural insight into the desensitized state of the NMDA receptor, and it is still not known whether dimer decoupling is the mechanism of desensitization in this subtype of the glutamate receptors. For studying the subunit arrangement of the NMDA receptor, we used modified NR1 and NR2A subunits of the NMDA receptor lacking the N-terminal domain. For NR1, residues 5–357 were deleted, and for NR2A, residues 1–385 were deleted (ΔNR1/ΔNR2A). For NR2A, a modified influenza hemagglutinin served as the signal peptide sequence (23Rachline J. Perin-Dureau F. Le Goff A. Neyton J. Paoletti P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 308-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The ΔNR1 and ΔNR2A subunits were further modified to eliminate the single non-disulfide bonded accessible cysteine, Cys-459, in NR1 and Cys-399 and Cys-460 in NR2A by mutating them to serine. These modified subunits ΔNR1* and ΔNR2A* were used for LRET investigations by introducing cysteines and or histidine tags to serve as donor- and acceptor-tagging sites. Mutations in the plasmids were introduced using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the integrity of the plasmid after cloning was verified by sequencing. The sites tagged for LRET measurements are displayed in the full-length AMPA structure (see Fig. 1) and NR1-NR2A crystal structure (see Fig. 3). Oocytes were isolated and maintained as described previously in Mg2+-free storage solution (22Gonzalez J. Rambhadran A. Du M. Jayaraman V. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10027-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ΔNR1*:ΔNR2A* mutant NMDA receptors were expressed in oocytes by injecting the RNA (mMessage mMachine T7 kit, Ambion) in a 1:2 ratio, respectively. Injection, blocking, and membrane preparations were performed as described previously (22Gonzalez J. Rambhadran A. Du M. Jayaraman V. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10027-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To measure background LRET, 1 unit of thrombin (Calbiochem) was added to the membrane preparation for 2–3 h at 4 °C. After digestion, LRET lifetimes were recorded and subtracted from the non-digested signal to determine the lifetime from the modified NMDA receptor protein. ATTO 465 maleimide and NiSO4 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, maleimide derivative of terbium chelate was purchased from Invitrogen, and fluorescein maleimide was purchased from Biotium. (Ni-NTA)2-Cy3 chelate was prepared as described previously (19Ramanoudjame G. Du M. Mankiewicz K.A. Jayaraman V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 10473-10478Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The fluorescence measurements were performed using a cuvette-based fluorescence lifetime spectrometer QuantaMaster model QM3-SS from Photon Technology International. A high power pulsed xenon lamp served as the excitation source, whereas emitted light was collected and passed through a monochromator on to a detector. The sample was held at 15 °C with a Peltier TE temperature controller. Data were collected using Fluorescan software (Photon Technology International) and analyzed using Origin 4.0 software (OriginLab Corp.). Three to four sets of data were averaged and fitted to obtain the lifetimes shown in Table 1. Each individual data set was examined to ensure that similar trends were maintained. LRET lifetimes were obtained by studying the sensitized emission at 510 nm for ATTO 465, 515 nm for fluorescein, and 575 nm for (Ni-NTA)2-Cy3 chelate, and the donor-only lifetimes were collected at 545 nm. The fluorescence decay was fitted to a function that is a sum of discrete exponentials, and the goodness of the exponential fit was determined from the random residual distribution with a chi-square value being close to unity. R0 values were determined for each donor:acceptor pair using Equations 1 and 2.J=∑iFD(λi)*∈A(λi)*λi4∑iFD(λi)(Eq. 1) R06=8.785*10−5*k2*ϕD*Jn4(Eq. 2) R=R0(τDAτD−τDA)1/6(Eq. 3) TABLE 1Fluorescence lifetimes and distances for ΔNR1*:ΔNR2A* receptorsProteinDonor:Acceptor fluorophore pairDonor lifetimeSensitized emission lifetime (desensitized)Distance desensitized stateμsμsÅΔNR1*Thr-396Histag/ΔNR1*T396C-Th:ΔNR2A*Terbium chelate:(Ni-NTA)2Cy31900 ± 1No LRET>100ΔNR1*:ΔNR2A*Asn-404Histag/ΔNR2A*N404C-ThTerbium chelate:(Ni-NTA)2Cy31750 ± 21672 ± 1260.1 ± 0.3ΔNR1*Thr-396Histag:ΔNR2A* N404C-ThTerbium chelate:(Ni-NTA)2Cy31904 ± 51254 ± 3672.5 ± 0.8318 ± 2449.7 ± 0.6ΔNR1*Th-Q525C-Th:ΔNR2A*Terbium chelate:fluorescein1606 ± 81089 ± 1251 ± 0.3ΔNR1*525tetrahistag:ΔNR2A*L777CTerbium chelate:Ni2+1754 ± 51155 ± 4213.3 ± 0.2ΔNR1*775tetrahistag:ΔNR2A*S519CTerbium chelate:Ni2+1681 ± 101330 ± 5014.9 ± 0.4ΔNR1*T396C-Th, A715C:ΔNR2A*Terbium chelate:ATTO 4651704 ± 18790 ± 1635.1 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab In Equation 1, J is the overlap integral, FD is the fluorescence spectrum of donor, λ is the wavelength, and ϵA is the absorption spectra of the acceptor tagged to the protein. The J value is used in Equation 2 to determine R0 of the fluorophore pair. In Equation 2, k is the orientation factor, ϕD is the quantum yield of donor, and n is the refractive index. The R0 value measured for the following donor:acceptor pairs was: for terbium chelate, (Ni-NTA)2-Cy3 chelate, 65 Å; for terbium chelate:fluorescein, 45 Å; for terbium chelate:ATTO 465, 36 Å; and for terbium chelate:Ni2+, 12 Å. The time constants of donor fluorescence decay in the absence of acceptor and either donor fluorescence or sensitized acceptor fluorescence in the presence of the acceptor, along with the R0 values, were used in the Förster's equation (Equation 3) to determine the distance between the donor and acceptor. The functionality of all the constructs used in the LRET measurements was established using two-electrode voltage clamp measurements. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed as detailed previously (22Gonzalez J. Rambhadran A. Du M. Jayaraman V. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 10027-10032Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The dose-response curves for the mutants used in LRET measurements are shown in supplemental Fig. 1. LRET lifetimes were used to determine distances between the N terminus of the agonist binding domains of NR1 (residue 396) and NR2A subunits (residue 404) (Fig. 1). To determine the LRET specific to the NMDA receptors, we have introduced thrombin site(s) in the ΔNR1* and ΔNR2A* subunits that allowed for selectively cleaving the donor or acceptor fluorophore tagged to these subunits. The LRET lifetime probed after thrombin cleavage allows for the quantification of the nonspecific LRET, which is then subtracted from the LRET signal to provide the signal from the modified NMDA receptors. The LRET lifetimes for all the constructs shown are the final difference lifetime. The ΔNR1*T396C-Th/ΔNR1*396Histag:ΔNR2A* tagged with terbium chelate:(Ni-NTA)2-Cy3 chelate donor:acceptor pair was used to measure the distance between residue 396 on one NR1 subunit with respect to the same residue on the second NR1 subunit (Fig. 2A). This construct did not show any significant LRET, suggesting that the distance between the residue 396 on one NR1 subunit with respect to the same residues on the second NR1 subunit is longer than that measurable by the terbium chelate:(Ni-NTA)2-Cy3 chelate donor:acceptor pair. Given that the R0 for this pair is 65 Å, for distances >100 Å, the efficiency of transfer decreases to around 6% (supplemental Fig. 2). Thus it can be concluded that the distance between residues 396 on the two NR1 subunits is greater than 100 Å. Similarly, to measure the distance between 404 on one NR2A subunit and the same residue on the second NR2A subunit, the ΔNR1*:ΔNR2A*Asn-404Histag/ΔNR2A*N404C-Th construct was used and tagged with terbium chelate:(Ni-NTA)2-Cy3 chelate donor:acceptor pair. The LRET lifetime for this construct (Fig. 2B) could be well represented by a single exponential decay, and the distance obtained from this lifetime was 60 Å. The LRET lifetime for the ΔNR1*396Histag:ΔNR2A*N404C-Th receptor tagged with terbium chelate:(Ni-NTA)2-Cy3, used to measure the distance between residue 396 on NR1 and residue 404 on NR2A, required a two-exponential fit (Fig. 2C). The two lifetimes indicate two distances between the NR1 and NR2A subunits. The LRET-based distances at the N terminus of the agonist binding domain are compared with the distances for equivalent residues on the full-length AMPA receptor structure for the three possible configurations in Table 2. The longer distance between the agonist binding domain N terminus in the NR1 subunits and the shorter distance between the agonist binding domain of the NR2 subunit is consistent with the configuration shown in Fig. 1A. To further confirm that the NMDA receptors are assembled in the configuration shown in Fig. 1A, we also measured the distance between residue 525 on one NR1 subunit with respect to the same residue on the second NR1 subunit. This distance changes significantly between the three possible configurations (Table 2) and hence can be differentiated in the LRET investigations. For measuring this distance, the ΔNR1*Th-Q525C-Th:ΔNR2A* construct was used and labeled with a 1:1 ratio of terbium chelate and fluorescein. The LRET lifetime could be well represented by a single exponential decay, suggesting primarily a single configuration for the NMDA receptor (Fig. 2D). Additionally, the LRET-based distance of 51 Å is closest to the distance of 49 Å seen in the configuration shown in Fig. 1A, thus revealing that the NMDA receptors are primarily in the configuration shown in Fig. 1A.TABLE 2Comparison of distances between desensitized state LRET measurements to antagonist-bound crystal structure of AMPA receptor and the other possible configurationsNMDA/homologous AMPA receptorDistance based on LRETAMPA receptor (PDB-3KG2)Distance based on configuration A (Fig. 1A)Distance based on configuration B (Fig. 1B)Distance based on configuration C (Fig. 1C)ÅÅÅÅNR1–396 to NR2A-404/AMPA-393 to AMPA-39372.5676756,102NR1–396 to NR1–396/AMPA-393 to AMPA-393>1001015672NR2A-404 to NR2A-404/AMPA-393 to AMPA-393605610267NR1–525 to NR1–525/AMPA-487 to AMPA-48751498265 Open table in a new tab The configuration established by the LRET-based distances is consistent with the structure that was predicted based on the AMPA receptor full-length structure and the cross-linking experiments where it has been shown that residue Glu-699 on NR1 subunits cross-links with the corresponding residue Glu-699 on the second NR1 subunit. Additionally, no cross-linking was observed between Lys-641 or Arg-645 and Asn-675/Glu-699 (in NR1) and Lys-641 or Arg-645 (in NR2), as would be expected for configurations in Fig. 1, B and C (1Sobolevsky A.I. Rosconi M.P. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 462: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). These cross-linking investigations, however, focused on the interactions of the subunits in the domain 2 of the agonist binding segments. The LRET investigations and hence the distances are obtained on domain 1 of the agonist binding domain. Hence the distances, in addition to confirming the arrangement, also validate the twist seen in the structure wherein the domains 2 of the agonist binding domain of the NR1 subunits are closer than the domains 2 of the NR2 subunits, whereas the domains 1 of the agonist binding domains of NR2 subunits are in closer proximity relative to domains 1 of the NR1 subunits (Fig. 1A). This twist ultimately results in the crossover in the dimer interactions seen in the N-terminal domains of the AMPA receptors (1Sobolevsky A.I. Rosconi M.P. Gouaux E. Nature. 2009; 462: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). In addition to determining the distances between the dimer, we have also used LRET to determine the distance between NR1 and NR2A subunits within the dimer. Two sets of residues expected to be in close proximity in the dimer interface 525 on NR1 and 777 on NR2, as well as 775 on NR1 and 519 on NR2, were used to study the changes within the dimer (Fig. 3). To selectively measure the distance within the dimer and not across the dimer, a cysteine was introduced on one subunit and a tetrahistidine tag was introduced on the second, and were tagged with a maleimide derivative of terbium chelate to serve as the donor and Ni2+ ion (R0 is 12 Å) to serve as the acceptor. The short R0 ensured that there was no transfer from the residues across the dimer interface. Additionally, the short R0 also ensured that the nonspecific labeling of cysteine residues far from the histidine tag does not contribute toward the LRET signal. Hence in the case where short distances were measured, it was not necessary to introduce a thrombin cleavage site. The LRET lifetimes for ΔNR1*525tetrahistag:ΔNR2A*L777C and ΔNR1*775tetrahistag:ΔNR2A*S519C (Fig. 4) could be well represented by a single exponential decay, and the corresponding distances are shown in Table 1. The distances within the dimer obtained with the LRET investigations are compared with the crystal structure distances for the NR1-NR2A dimer in Table 3. The LRET distances for all the constructs were obtained in the presence of saturating concentrations of glutamate and glycine; hence the distances represent primarily the desensitized form of the receptor. The crystal structures of the isolated ligand binding domain of the NR1-NR2A dimer, on the other hand, lack the transmembrane domains that drive the formation of the desensitized state and hence most likely represent the structure of the dimer in the open channel state of the protein and not the desensitized state. The longer distances in the desensitized state of the NMDA receptor relative to the distances expected for the open channel state of the receptor suggest that there is a decoupling of the dimer interface in the desensitized state. To further establish that such a comparison can be made between the LRET investigations and the x-ray structures, we have measured the distance within a given subunit using the ΔNR1*T396C-Th, A715C:ΔNR2A* tagged with terbium chelate, and ATTO 465 as donor and acceptor. This construct allows us to determine the distance between residue 396 and 715 in the NR1 subunit. The LRET lifetime is well represented with a single exponential with the distance corresponding to 35.1 Å, which is similar to the distance of 34.3 Å observed in the crystal structure (Fig. 5). It should be noted that the efficiency of transfer from the second NR1 subunit is expected to be 0.2% for transfer between 396 and 396 and 3.3% for transfer between 715 and 715 for the terbium chelate and ATTO 465 as donor and acceptor, and hence these do not contribute to the LRET signal. The desensitized LRET-based distances are also compared with the changes in distances observed for homologous sites in the desensitized-like crystal structure of S729C AMPA and the cyclothiazide-bound open channel crystal structure of the AMPA receptor (Table 3). The changes in distances between the desensitized and open channel state across the dimer for the NMDA receptors are similar to that observed for the AMPA receptors. This similarity further confirms that the dimer interface is decoupled in the NMDA receptors and also provides the evidence for a similar mechanism for desensitization in the NMDA receptors as seen in the AMPA receptors.TABLE 3Comparison of changes in distances between desensitized state and open channel state of NMDA and AMPA receptorsProteinNMDA receptorProteinAMPA receptorDistance based on LRET desensitizedDistance in X-ray structure PDB 2A5T; open (9Furukawa H.

https://openalex.org/W1983174095,"Glycerolipid synthesis in plants involves two major metabolic pathways compartmentalized in the chloroplasts and cytosol, respectively. Although these two parallel pathways are regulated with considerable flexibility, the factors mediating this process remain unclear. To investigate the influence of glycerol 3-phosphate (Gly-3-P) on the interactions of the glycerolipid pathways, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis lines with a feedback-resistant Gly-3-P dehydrogenase gene (gpsAFR) from Escherichia coli. gpsAFR was detected in the cytosol, but augmented Gly-3-P levels were observed in the cytosol as well as in chloroplasts. Glycerolipid composition and fatty acid positional distribution analyses revealed an altered fatty acid flux that affected not only the molar ratios of glycerolipid species but also their fatty acid composition. To decipher this complex pathway, a transgenic line was subjected to lipidomic analysis and a global gene-expression survey. The results revealed that changes in Gly-3-P metabolism caused altered expression of a broad array of genes. When viewed from the perspective of glycerolipid metabolism, coherent networks emerged, revealing that many enzymatic components of the glycerolipid pathways operate in a modular manner under the influence of Gly-3-P. Transcript levels of the enzymes involved in the prokaryotic pathway were mostly induced, whereas genes of the eukaryotic pathway enzymes were largely suppressed. Hence, the gene-expression changes were consistent with the detected biochemical phenotype. Our results suggest that Gly-3-P modulates the balance of the two glycerolipid pathways in Arabidopsis by influencing both metabolic flux and gene transcription.

Our results suggest that Gly-3-P modulates the balance of the two glycerolipid pathways in Arabidopsis by influencing both metabolic flux and gene transcription. In plant cells, fatty acids are generated primarily in plastids, but glycerolipid biosynthesis takes place both in chloroplasts and in the cytosol (1.Gardiner S.E. Roughan P.G. Slack C.R.

The glycerolipid pathway in chloroplasts is believed to be crucial for generating phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 2The abbreviations used are: PGphosphatidylglycerolGly-3-Pglycerol 3-phosphatePCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePIphosphatidylinositolMGDGmonogalactosyldiacylglycerolDGDGdigalactosyldiacylglycerolDAGdiacylglycerolqRTquantitative reverse transcriptionERendoplasmic reticulumACPacyl carrier proteinESI-MSelectronspray tandem mass spectrometry. but in species such as Arabidopsis, it also contributes partially to the production of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglcyerol (DGDG) in chloroplasts. The glycerolipid pathway in the cytosolic compartment, known as the eukaryotic pathway, sustains the synthesis of all membrane phospholipids in the cytosol, and it also generates some of the diacylglycerol (DAG) moieties required for the synthesis of MGDG and DGDG (3.Roughan P.G. Slack C.R. Annu. Rev. Plant. Physiol. 1982; 33: 97-132Crossref Google Scholar). The chloroplast pathway, which incorporates fatty acid groups from acyl-ACP to generate glycerolipid molecules resembling cyanobacteria glycerolipids with C16 fatty acids were esterified almost exclusively at the sn-2 position (4.Frentzen M.

Because the sn-2 C16 fatty acid in MGDG originating from the prokaryotic pathway is subsequently desaturated to form cis-7,10,13-hexadecatrienoic acid (C16:3) (8.Gardiner S.E. Roughan P.G. Biochem.

Understanding this metabolic adjustment is important because impairments in balancing the two glycerolipid pathways have major consequences for plant performance (20.Kachroo P. Shanklin J. Shah J.

Experiments using isolated chloroplast and leaf explants have all revealed Gly-3-P as a factor influencing the balance of the two glycerolipid pathways (1.Gardiner S.E. Roughan P.G. Slack C.R.

A deficiency in Gly-3-P in chloroplasts reduces the carbon flux through the prokaryotic pathway (25.Miquel M. Cassagne C. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In previous reports, the role of Gly-3-P was explained chiefly by its capacity to affect fatty acylation processes in chloroplasts. In this study, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants with increased Gly-3-P levels by overexpressing an Escherichia coli gene encoding a Gly-3-P dehydrogenase (gpsAFR) insensitive to feedback inhibition (26.Bell R.M. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7153-7158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transgenic lines had Gly-3-P levels severalfold higher than wild-type controls under standard growth conditions, and they exhibited a glycerolipid phenotype consistent with an adjusted metabolic balance between the two glycerolipid pathways. We conducted lipidomic as well as global gene-expression analyses with the transgenic plants. Our data provide a comprehensive view of the metabolic and enzymatic components involved in balancing the two glycerolipid pathways in response to Gly-3-P level changes. Our results also reveal many transcriptional changes in the enzymatic components of the glycerolipid pathways associated with Gly-3-P metabolic perturbation. Plants were grown in growth chambers with a 16-h light and 8-h dark regime with a photosynthetic photon flux density of 75 μmol of photons m−2 s−1. The day/night temperature was controlled at 22/17 °C. All biochemical analyses were performed with leaves harvested at the rosette stage from 3-week-old plants. Bacterial strain BB26-36R2 (gpsAFR, plsB) was a generous gift from Professor John E. Cronan, Jr. (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champion). The gpsAFR allele was PCR amplified and fully sequenced. Primers GAGAGCTCTTAGTGGCTGCTGCGCTC (GPSA31) and GAAGAAGGATCCAACAATGAACCAACGTAA (GPSA5) were designed according to the sequence of gpsAFR (accession P37606) with SacI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, at each end. The primers were used to perform PCR amplification of the gpsAFR sequence. The PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification Kit (Qiagen) and digested with SacI/BamHI. The SacI/BamHI-digested gpsAFR DNA fragment was subsequently inserted into the Agrobacterium binary vector pBI121 (Clontech) to replace the GUS gene. The gpsAFR gene-expression cassette thus contains the gpsAFR gene under control of the constitutive 35S-promoter and flanked at the 3′ end with a NOS terminator. The junction region between the 35S-promoter and the gpsAFR coding sequence was confirmed through sequencing. Transformation of Arabidopsis was performed through vacuum infiltration, and T1 transgenic plants were selected through germinating seeds in ½ MS medium containing 50 mg/liter of kanamycin. Biochemical analysis was performed with tissues harvested from T2 plants. Chloroplasts were isolated from 3-week-old Arabidopsis rosette leaves according to the method of Rensink et al. (27.Rensink W.A. Pilon M. Weisbeek P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using a Percoll gradient consisting of 2 ml of 70% (v/v) Percoll (Sigma), 4 ml of 50% (v/v) Percoll, and 4 ml of 40% (v/v) Percoll/grinding buffer in a 15-ml polycarbonate tube. The gradient was centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 × g in an HB-4 rotor with the brake off. The lower band at the 50 to 70% interface was isolated for Gly-3-P content and Western blot analysis. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Protein content was measured according to the method of Bradford (28.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Gly-3-P in leaf tissues was extracted according to the method of Shen et al. (29.Shen W. Wei Y. Dauk M. Tan Y. Taylor D.C. Selvaraj G. Zou J. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 422-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Gly-3-P in chloroplasts was extracted by the protocol of Sauer and Heise (30.Sauer A. Heise K.P. Z. Naturforsch. 1983; 38c: 399-404Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Ice-cold chloroplast suspensions were immediately centrifuged through a layer of silicon oil into 20 μl of 1 m HClO4 after isolation. The concentration of Gly-3-P in the neutralized leaf and chloroplast extracts was measured enzymatically via Gly-3-P dehydrogenase based on the method of Shen et al. (29.Shen W. Wei Y. Dauk M. Tan Y. Taylor D.C. Selvaraj G. Zou J. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 422-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). For determining the fatty acid composition of leaf tissues, Arabidopsis leaves (200 mg) in 2 ml of 10% KOH in methanol were heated at 80 °C for 2 h. After the mixture was cooled to room temperature and 1 ml of 50% HCl was added, the mixtures were extracted twice with 2 ml of hexane and dried under N2. Each sample was then supplemented with 2 ml of 3 n methanolic HCl and heated at 80 °C for 2 h. After the addition of 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution and 2 ml of hexane, fatty acid methyl esters were extracted into the organic phase and determined by gas chromatography. Fatty acid double bond indices were calculated as described by Falcone et al. (31.Falcone D.L. Ogas J.P. Somerville C.R. BMC Plant Biol. 2004; 4: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Lipid extraction and purification by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel 60 (EMD Chemical, Germany) was performed according to the method of Miquel and Browse (18.Miquel M. Browse J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1502-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Leaf tissues were frozen rapidly by immersion in liquid N2 and ground under liquid N2 before being extracted. The plate was first developed in chloroform, methanol, 50% aqueous ammonia (65:35:2, by volume). After being allowed sufficient time to dry, the plate was then developed, at right angles to the first development, in chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, water (85:15:10:3, by volume). Lipids were visualized with iodine vapor. To determine the fatty acid composition and the relative amounts of individual lipids, the silica gel from each lipid spot was transferred to a screw-capped tube, and fatty acid methyl esters were prepared as described above. The methyl esters were quantified by gas chromatography using 17:0 fatty acid as an internal standard. The fatty acid composition at the sn-2 position of individual lipids was determined by lipase digestion according to Miquel et al. (25.Miquel M. Cassagne C. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After TLC, lipids were extracted from the silica gel by the method of Bligh and Dyer (32.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). The protocol for digestion with Rhizopus sp. lipase, including purification of the lyso-derivatives and fatty acids, was described by Siebertz and Heinz (33.Siebertz H.P. Heinz E. Z. Naturforsch. 1977; 32c: 193-205Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), except that 50 mm H3BO4 was added to the buffer used for lipase digestion to minimize intramolecular acyl transfer on the lyso-lipids produced (25.Miquel M. Cassagne C. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Fatty methyl esters were formed from untreated lipids, lyso-lipids, and fatty acids as described above, and the fatty acid composition of each compound was determined by gas chromatography. Lipid extraction for lipidomic analysis was performed according to the method of Welti et al. (34.Welti R. Li W. Li M. Sang Y. Biesiada H. Zhou H.E. Rajashekar C.B. Williams T.D. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31994-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). For each sample, the rosettes of two or three plants were cut at the sampling time and transferred to 3 ml of isopropyl alcohol with 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene at 75 °C. After 15 min, 1.5 ml of chloroform and 0.6 ml of water were added. The tubes were shaken for 1 h, followed by removal of the extract. The plants were re-extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1) with 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene five times with 30 min of agitation each time until all of the remaining plant tissue appeared white. The remaining plant tissues were heated overnight at 105 °C and weighed. The weights of these dried, extracted tissues were the “dry weights” of the plants. The dry weights ranged from 9 to 47 mg. The combined extracts were washed once with 1 ml of 1 m KCl and once with 2 ml of water. The solvent was evaporated under nitrogen, and the lipid extract was dissolved in 1 ml of chloroform. Electronspray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) analysis was performed at the Kansas Lipidomic Research Center. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits to two polypeptides, GLEAETGRLLQDVAREALGDQIPLAVISGP and LASTDQTFADDLQQLLHCGKSFRVYSNPDF, synthesized based on the deduced amino acid sequence of E. coli gpsAFR. Immunoblot analysis of gpsAFR protein from total leaf extracts and purified chloroplasts was performed according to Millenaar et al. (35.Millenaar F.F. Roelofs R. Gonzàlez-Meler M.A. Siedow J.N. Wagner A.M. Lambers H. Plant J. 2000; 23: 623-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins (10 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters using blot transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol). Antiserum for gpsAFR was used as the primary antibody with a dilution factor of 1:1000. Anti-rabbit IgG Fab fragments conjugated to peroxidase (Roche Applied Science) were used as the secondary antibody (1:25,000). The blot was detected for 1.5 min using the protein gel blotting detection reagent ECL+ Plus (Amersham Biosciences) and developed with BioMax MR film (Kodak). Total RNA of leaf tissues was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) under the manufacturer's recommendations and subjected to RNase-free DNase I treatment (Invitrogen) at 25 °C for 15 min to remove contaminating DNA. The yield and RNA purity were determined spectrophotometrically with a spectrophotometer DU@740 (Beckman), and the quality of the RNA was verified by electrophoresis on a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel. Purified total RNA was precipitated and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to a final concentration of 500 ng/μl. Synthesis of cDNA, cRNA labeling, hybridization, and scanning were performed at the Botany Affymetrix Genechip Facility, University of Toronto (Toronto, ON, Canada). Three independent biological replicates were performed for both the wild-type and the transgenic line. A total of six. CEL files containing the raw probe intensity values were imported into the R-package Affy (36.Gautier L. Cope L. Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (3928) Google Scholar). Background adjustment and quantile normalization were performed using the robust multianalysis package implemented in Bioconductor (37.Gentleman R.C. Carey V.J. Bates D.M. Bolstad B. Dettling M. Dudoit S. Ellis B. Gautier L. Ge Y. Gentry J. Hornik K. Hothorn T. Huber W. Iacus S. Irizarry R. Leisch F. Li C. Maechler M. Rossini A.J. Sawitzki G. Smith C. Smyth G. Tierney L. Yang J.Y. Zhang J. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The quantile normalization method was used because it has better precision than MicroArray Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) and dChip for low expression values (38.Bolstad B.M. Irizarry R.A. Astrand M. Speed T.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar). Using the R-package LIMMA (by reading the data and creating an expression set of the data after log2 transformation), a linear model was fitted and contrast of “transgenic versus wild-type” was extracted. For each gene, the mean log2 fold-change and corresponding p value were calculated from an empirical Bayes approach to compute moderated t-statistics (39.Smyth G.K. Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology. 2004; Vol. 3 (Article 3)Google Scholar). False discovery rate correction (40.Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. 1995; 57B: 289-300Google Scholar) was applied to account for testing of multiple genes. Genes were considered differentially regulated if the p value was less than 0.05 and the fold-change in the expression level was greater than 1.5. Functional annotations of genes were obtained from the Bio-Array Resource for Arabidopsis Functional Genomics data base (BAR) using the probe set numbers provided by the GeneChip manufacturer (Affymetrix Co.). Total RNA was extracted from the leaves of wild-type and transgenic plants with the Plant RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The amount of RNA was determined by spectrophotometry at 260 nm, and its integrity was assessed by gel electrophoresis. For real time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), 1 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with a QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). Specific primers (Tm, 57 °C-63 °C) were designed to generate PCR products between 75 and 130 bp. The specificity of all primers was checked with BLASTn searches. Actin 2 (At3g18780) was used as an endogenous control for standardization. The primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in supplemental Table S5. Real time qRT-PCR was performed with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and amplification was monitored with ABI StepOne Real Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystem). A standard thermal profile was used for all PCRs: 50 °C for 2 min; 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 57 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using StepOne software 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Genes picked for verification with real time PCR were chosen based on their possible significance in glycerolipid pathways. Results from three replicates are shown. Statistical significance was determined by the Student's unpaired t test (two-tailed). Bell and Cronan (26.Bell R.M. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7153-7158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) discovered a mutant E. coli strain, BB26-36R2 (gpsAFR, plsB), in which the Gly-3-P auxotrophic phenotype, due to a mutation in Gly-3-P acyltransferase (plsB), is suppressed by a second mutation in the structural gene (gpsA, accession P37606) encoding the biosynthetic Gly-3-P dehydrogenase. The mutated version of the Gly-3-P dehydrogenase, gpsAFR, is about 20-fold less sensitive to feedback inhibition, and as a result, E. coli strains harboring this allele had Gly-3-P contents 12 times higher than that of the control. We amplified the coding region of the gpsAFR allele and found a point mutation in the cordon for amino acid 255 (GAS → GAO), which resulted in a conversion of Asp255 in the wild-type enzyme (PID, g91790037) to Glu255 in gpsAFR. The structural significance of this amino acid substitution is unclear, but the residue is located very close to the active site pocket based on the structure of human Gly-3-P dehydrogenase (41.Ou X. Ji C. Han X. Zhao X. Li X. Mao Y. Wong L.L. Bartlam M. Rao Z. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 858-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This gpsAFR allele was inserted into a plant transformation vector under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S-promoter and introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia). The gpsAFR transgenic plants were indistinguishable from wild-type plants in growth and development under standard growth conditions. We assessed gpsAFR protein levels in several transgenic lines by immunoblot analysis. Total leaf protein extracts and protein prepared from purified chloroplasts were subjected to SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” High levels of gpsAFR protein were detected in the total leaf extract, but not purified chloroplast extract (Fig. 1A). Thus, as expected, the gpsAFR protein appeared to be localized in the cytosol. Gly-3-P content was assessed using rosette leaves of plants growing in soil. Leaf tissues of wild-type Arabidopsis plants had Gly-3-P levels of 60 nmol/g of fresh weight, whereas the transgenic lines had Gly-3-P level of 200 nmol/g of fresh weight (Fig. 1B, panel a). We also isolated chloroplasts and determined Gly-3-P levels in this particular compartment. Wild-type Arabidopsis chloroplasts under our growth conditions had a Gly-3-P level of 5 nmol/mg of chlorophyll, a level within the range reported for spinach (11 nmol/mg of chlorophyll) (1.Gardiner S.E. Roughan P.G. Slack C.R. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1316-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, chloroplasts of the transgenic lines had a Gly-3-P level severalfold higher than that of the wild-type control (Fig. 1B, panel b). The chloroplast Gly-3-P content might have been underestimated due to possible leakage during organelle fractionation. Nevertheless, by comparing the wild-type plants and the transgenic lines that underwent the same procedure, it became apparent that the Gly-3-P content in the chloroplasts of the transgenic lines was much higher. Thus, consistent with the presence of a chloroplast membrane carrier that is capable of accepting 3-carbon compounds with a phosphate molecule attached to it (42.Fliege R. Flügge U.I. Werdan K. Heldt H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 502: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that Gly-3-P in the cytosol was likely transported across the chloroplast membrane. Surveys of total lipid fatty acid profiles in leaves from a large number of transgenic lines consistently showed increased 16:0 and 16:3 content (data not shown). Table 1 presents data from some of the selected lines. The molar ratios of C18:1, C18:2, and C18:3 fatty acids were all substantially lower. Consequently, the general alteration of the fatty acid profile in leaf tissues can be best described as an elevated C16:C18 fatty acid ratio. Thus, in keeping with chloroplast feeding experiments (1.Gardiner S.E. Roughan P.G. Slack C.R. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 1316-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the elevated Gly-3-P levels appeared to reduce palmitoyl-ACP elongation in planta as well. However, these fatty acid compositional changes do not seem to alter the general membrane unsaturation level based on assessment of double bond indices (31.Falcone D.L. Ogas J.P. Somerville C.R. BMC Plant Biol. 2004; 4: 17Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We also analyzed the fatty acid composition and content of the seed oil. Despite of repeated analyses with multiple lines, we failed to detect any significant changes in either seed trait when compared with those of the wild-type plants raised together under standard growth conditions. Further analysis presented below was focused on rosette leaf tissues of two transgenic lines.TABLE 1Fatty acid composition of total leaf lipids of gpsAFR transgenic lines and wild-type (WT) ArabidopsisFatty acid compositionC16:C18Double bond indices16:016:1aSum of 16:1 cis and trans fatty acid.16:216:318:018:118:218:3mol %WT15.0 ± 0.33.9 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.112.6 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.214.7 ± 0.348.6 ± 0.60.482.1615–618.2 ± 0.8bStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.05.3.8 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.622.6 ± 2.2bStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.05.2.2 ± 0.3bStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.05.0.9 ± 0.8bStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.05.9.0 ± 0.1cStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.001.42.4 ± 0.7dStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.01.0.832.1822–4419.8 ± 1.6bStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.05.3.2 ± 0.3bStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.05.0.9 ± 0.118.0 ± 1.0cStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.001.1.6 ± 1.02.2 ± 1.310.8 ± 0.8bStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.05.43.5 ± 0.9cStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.001.0.722.1554–818.0 ± 0.9bStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-tailed Student's t test, p < 0.05.2.9 ± 0.2cStatistical significance compared with WT was determined by the two-t"
https://openalex.org/W2046587878,"Because the photosynthetic apparatus contains a massive amount of nitrogen in plants, the regulation of its development by sugar signals is important to the maintenance of the carbon-nitrogen balance. In this study we isolated an Arabidopsis mutant (sicy-192) whose cotyledon greening was inhibited by treatments with sugars such as sucrose, glucose, and fructose. In the mutant, the gene encoding plastidic alkaline/neutral invertase (INV-E) was point-mutated at codon 294, with Tyr substituted for Cys (C294Y). Interestingly, the greening of cotyledons in the knock-out INV-E lines was not inhibited by treatment with the sugars. In addition, the knock-out INV-E lines expressing an INV-E:C294Y or INV-E:C294A gene had the same phenotype as sicy-192 mutants, whereas the lines expressing a wild-type INV-E gene had the same phenotype as wild-type plants. A recombinant INV-E:C294Y protein had the same enzymatic activity as a recombinant INV-E protein, suggesting that the Cys-294 residue of INV-E is important for its functions in the chloroplasts. On treatment with sucrose, the expression of photosynthesis-related genes was weaker in seedlings of mutant plants than wild-type seedlings, whereas the activity of nitrate reductase was stronger in the mutant plants than wild-type plants. These findings suggest that Cys-294 of INV-E is associated with the development of the photosynthetic apparatus and the assimilation of nitrogen in Arabidopsis seedlings to control the ratio of sucrose content to hexose content."
https://openalex.org/W2002461944,"Biologically active membrane gangliosides, expressed and released by many human tumors, are hypothesized to significantly impact tumor progression. Lack of a model of complete and specific tumor ganglioside depletion in vivo, however, has hampered elucidation of their role. Here, we report the creation of a novel, stable, genetically induced tumor cell system resulting in specific and complete blockade of ganglioside synthesis. Wild-type (WT) and GM3 synthase/GM2 synthase double knockout (DKO) murine embryonic fibroblasts were transformed using amphotropic retrovirus-transduced oncogenes (pBABE-c-MycT58A+H-RasG12V). The transformed cells, WTt and DKOt respectively, evidenced comparable integrated copy numbers and oncogene expression. Ganglioside synthesis was completely blocked in the DKOt cells, importantly without triggering an alternate pathway of ganglioside synthesis. Ganglioside depletion (to <0.5 nmol/107 cells from 9 to 11 nmol/107 WTt or untransfected normal fibroblasts) did not adversely affect cell proliferation kinetics but did reduce cell migration on fibronectin-coated wells, consistent with our previous observations in ganglioside-depleted normal human fibroblasts. Strikingly, despite similar oncogene expression and growth kinetics, DKOt cells evidenced significantly impaired tumor growth in syngeneic immunocompetent mice, underscoring the pivotal role of tumor cell gangliosides and providing an ideal system for probing their mechanisms of action in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1988703154,"Huntingtin-associated protein-1 (Hap1) is a neuronal protein that associates with huntingtin, the Huntington disease protein. Although Hap1 and huntingtin are known to be involved in intracellular trafficking, whether and how the impairment of Hap1-associated trafficking leads to neurological pathology and symptoms remain to be seen. As Hap1 is enriched in neuronal cells in the brain, addressing this issue is important in defining the role of defective intracellular trafficking in the selective neuropathology associated with Hap1 dysfunction. Here, we find that Hap1 is abundantly expressed in orexin (hypocretin)-producing neurons (orexin neurons), which are distinctly distributed in the hypothalamus and play an important role in the regulation of feeding and behavior. We created conditional Hap1 knock-out mice to selectively deplete Hap1 in orexin neurons via the Cre-loxP system. These mice show process fragmentation of orexin neurons and reductions in food intake, body weight, and locomotor activity. Sucrose density gradient fractionation reveals that loss of Hap1 in the mouse brain also reduces the distribution of trafficking protein complexes and cargo proteins in the fractions that are enriched in synaptosomes. These results suggest that Hap1 is critical for the transport of multiple proteins to the nerve terminals to maintain the integrity of neuronal processes and that selective disruption of the processes of orexin neurons can cause abnormal feeding and locomotor activity.

Charrin B.C. Borrell-Pagès M. Dompierre J.P. Rangone H. Cordelières F.P. De Mey J. MacDonald M.E. Lessmann V. Humbert S. Saudou F. Cell. 2004; 118: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Despite all these interesting findings, whether impairment of Hap1-associated intracellular trafficking can cause neurological symptoms is unclear. Given the abundant expression of Hap1 in the hypothalamus, we wanted to investigate whether decreasing Hap1 expression in hypothalamic neurons could alter neuronal intracellular trafficking and animal behavior. The hypothalamus consists of many cell types that play a critical role in regulating sleep, appetite, and energy homeostasis. In mammals, neurons in the lateral hypothalamic (LH) area are particularly important in these functions (15Bellinger L.L. Bernardis L.L. Physiol. Behav. 2002; 76: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The orexin (hypocretin)-producing neurons (orexin neurons) are a small group of neurons located specifically within the LH, and they project widely throughout the entire brain (16Peyron C.

Nakazato M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Thus, orexin neurons can be readily identified via immunocytochemistry and provide us with an ideal system to examine whether Hap1 deficiency in these neurons can affect neuronal structure and function. To this end, we used the Cre-LoxP system to selectively deplete the expression of Hap1 in orexin neurons. We found that such depletion leads to decreased food intake and locomotor activity in mice. Importantly, we also discovered that a lack of Hap1 can affect neuronal process extension and reduce the distribution of trafficking protein complexes in sucrose density gradient fractions enriched in synaptosomes. These findings are strong in vivo evidence for the critical role Hap1-associated intracellular trafficking plays in maintaining neuronal process integrity and normal animal behavior. In an earlier study we generated Hap1 null mice via the conventional knock-out approach (3Li S.H. Yu Z.X. Li C.L. Nguyen H.P. Zhou Y.X. Deng C. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6956-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate conditional Hap1 knock-out mice, exon1 of the mouse Hap1 gene was flanked by two loxP sites to allow the Cre-mediated deletion of exon1. The phosphoglycerate kinase-neomycin resistance cassette was inserted together with the loxP sequence in the 3′-flanking intron of exon1. All loxP sequences were in the same orientation to allow Cre-mediated simultaneous excision of exon1 and the neomycin cassette. The targeting vector was linearized prior to electroporation into SV129-derived embryonic stem cells. Positive embryonic stem cells with correct locus targeting were identified by screening genomic DNA using PCR and confirmed with Southern blotting. These cells were then injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Chimeric males were crossed with wild-type female mice (C57BL/6) to generate heterozygous floxed Hap1 (Hap1+/loxp) mice (C57BL/6/SV129), and homozygous mice (Hap1loxp/loxp) were produced by mating of the heterozygous mice. Those mice were crossed with mice (C57BL/6) expressing a Cre recombinase under the control of human prepro-orexin promoter (19Matsuki T. Nomiyama M. Takahira H. Hirashima N. Kunita S. Takahashi S. Yagami K. Kilduff T.S. Bettler B. Yanagisawa M. Sakurai T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) in the orexin neurons. The resulting heterozygous mice were used to generate homozygous conditional knock-out (Orexin-Cre+/Hap1loxp/loxp, referred to as Orexin-Hap1−/−) or heterozygous (Orexin-Cre+/Hap1+/loxp, referred to as Orexin-Hap1+/−) mice. Genotyping of these mice was performed via PCR to amplify the mouse Hap1 DNA fragment (from 3951 to 6957 nucleotides) using the forward (5′-TTTTGGAGGTCTGGTCTCGCTCTG-3′) and reverse (5′-AGGGGCCTGGATGCTGTAAAGG-3′) primers. Expression analysis of Hap1 and behavioral tests of heterozygous Orexin-Hap1+/− and wild-type mice revealed no differences between these two groups. Because homozygous (Orexin-Hap1−/−) and heterozygous (Orexin-Hap1+/−) mice share the same mixed genetic background, mice of these two genotypes were used mainly to reveal differences related to Hap1 deficiency. All mice were bred and maintained in the animal facility at Emory University in accordance with institutional animal care and use guidelines. Antibodies against Hap1, pHap1A, Ahi1, KCL, and dynactin p150 were generated in our laboratory and have been described previously (4Sheng G. Chang G.Q. Lin J.Y. Yu Z.X. Fang Z.H. Rong J. Lipton S.A.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6019-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used in this study were obtained from commercial sources. Antibodies against EEA1, GM130, and SNAP-25 were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Orexin-A antibody used in Western blotting and Htt 2166 antibody were from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Orexin-A antibody used in immunocytochemistry and BDNF antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against syntaxin, SVP38, and γ-tubulin were from Sigma. Beclin-1 antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). PSD95 antibody was from Upstate Cell Signaling (Lake Placid, NY) and University of California, Davis/NINDS, National Institutes of Health/NIMH NeuroMab Facility (Davis, CA). Orexin-Hap1+/− and Orexin-Hap1−/− mice were weighed every 3 days after birth until 100 days old. Daily food and water consumptions were also recorded. More than 20 mice in each group were assayed. Locomotor activity was assessed using an automated system (San Diego Instruments, La Jolla, CA) with photobeams that recorded ambulations (consecutive beam breaks). Mice were placed individually in the chambers with free access to food and water in a 12-h light (7:00–19:00) and 12-h dark (19:00–7:00) cycle. Mice were allowed to acclimate for 3 h prior to recording. Activity was recorded once per h for 24 h. Fasting mice were given water only during the recording. A total of 18 male and 14 female mice were analyzed. Immunofluorescent staining of mouse brain sections was performed using the method described previously (20Wang C.E. Tydlacka S. Orr A.L. Yang S.H. Graham R.K. Hayden M.R. Li S. Chan A.W. Li X.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 2738-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). After mice were anesthetized, brains were removed, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4 °C, and sectioned at 10 μm with a cryostat at −24 °C and mounted onto gelatin-coated slides. The slides were stored at −80 °C until use. The tissues on slides were fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde. After washes, the tissues were blocked with a buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin and PBST (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 2 h at room temperature. Primary guinea pig antibody against Hap1 and goat antibody against orexin-A were incubated with the tissue at 4 °C overnight. Alexa 488- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies and nuclear Hoechst dye were then used to finalize the staining. For immunocytochemistry with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining, mice were intracardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the isolated brains were cut into 40-μm sections with a cryostat (Leica 1920) at −20 °C. Sections were treated with 3% H2O2 for 10 min and then 1% sodium borohydride in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After sufficient washes (four times for 15 min each time), the sections were blocked by PBST for 1 h and incubated with anti-orexin-A antibody overnight at room temperature. A biotin/avidin immunoassay (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) along with DAB staining was performed to visualize orexin neurons and neurites. We examined five wild-type (WT) mice and five homozygous orexin-Hap1 knock-out mutant mice. The hypothalamic sections were isolated from these mouse brains for immunostaining of orexin neurons. Light micrographs of series images were taken using a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) microscope (Axiovert 200 MOT) and a ×20 or ×63 lens (LD-Achroplan ×20/0.4 or 63/0.75) with a digital camera (Orca-100; Hamamatsu Photonics, Bridgewater, NJ) and the Openlab software (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Brain sections of WT and Hap1 mutant mice containing approximately the same hypothalamic region were compared for orexin neuronal staining. We performed sucrose density gradient fractionation using the method described previously (21Uldry M. Steiner P. Zurich M.G. Béguin P. Hirling H. Dolci W. Thorens B. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Muddashetty R.S. Keliæ S. Gross C. Xu M. Bassell G.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5338-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Wild-type or Hap1 null mouse brains were homogenized in a buffer (100 mg/ml) containing 20 mm HEPES, 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.53 mm KH2PO4, 212.7 mm glucose, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce). Post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation of the homogenized brain lysates at 1300 × g for 5 min. A 5–45% (w/v) sucrose gradient was formed in a 12-ml tube containing 5 and 45% sucrose solutions with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture. One ml of the post-nuclear supernatant was loaded and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman rotor SW 41 for 120 min at 4 °C. A total of 12 fractions of 1 ml each was collected and subjected to SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis. The samples were separated on a 4–12% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk/PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and the blots were rinsed with 1× PBS for 5 min, with four changes of the 1× PBS, and incubated with primary antibodies in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS overnight at 4 °C. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or -mouse IgGs were incubated with the blot in 5% milk/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. ECL-Plus (GE Healthcare) was then used to reveal immunoreactive bands on the blots. All data were expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical results were analyzed by GraphPad Prism (version 5) software, and statistical significance (p < 0.05) was assessed using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance, followed when appropriate by a post hoc analysis using Dunnett's test. Orexin neurons are a small group of neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic region (Fig. 1A). Using immunofluorescent double labeling, we found that some Hap1-positive neurons also expressed orexin-A. High magnification graphs show that Hap1-positive neurons display cytoplasmic puncta as reported previously (23Gutekunst C.A. Li S.H. Yi H. Ferrante R.J. Li X.J. Hersch S.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7674-7686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these cells show orexin-A staining, although others do not, indicating that a fraction of Hap1 neurons express orexin-A (Fig. 1B). To selectively delete the Hap1 gene in hypothalamic neurons in mice, we first established gene-targeting mice in which exon1 of the Hap1 gene was flanked by loxP sites. The floxed Hap1 mice C57BL/6/SV129 carrying homozygous loxP-flanked Hap1 (Hap1Flox/Flox; Fig. 2A) were mated to Orexin-Cre C57BL/6 mice, which express Cre under the control of the human prepro-orexin promoter in orexin neurons (19Matsuki T. Nomiyama M. Takahira H. Hirashima N. Kunita S. Takahashi S. Yagami K. Kilduff T.S. Bettler B. Yanagisawa M. Sakurai T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Genotyping of these mice from the tissue of tail or hypothalamus revealed the high efficiency and specificity of Cre recombination in the mouse hypothalamus (Fig. 2B). We then analyzed the expression of Hap1 via Western blotting and found that Hap1 in the hypothalamus of Orexin-Hap1−/− mice is apparently reduced compared with wild-type and Orexin-Hap1+/− mice (Fig. 2C). Because heterozygous Orexin-Hap1+/− mice show the same level of Hap1 as wild-type mice, but also carry the Cre and loxP transgenes, a genetic background similar to homozygous Orexin-Hap1−/− mice, we used Orexin-Hap1+/− mice as a control for comparison with Orexin-Hap1−/− mice to define the specific effects caused by Hap1 deficiency. To confirm the specific activity of the Cre recombination in orexin neurons, we labeled the mouse brain sections with antibodies against orexin-A and Hap1 (Fig. 2D). Hap1 protein was diminished in all orexin-positive neurons but remained in non-orexin cells in homozygous mice (Orexin-Hap1−/−), indicating an efficient and selective deletion of the Hap1 gene in these neurons. Suppression of Hap1 via adenoviral shRNA in various types of cells in the hypothalamic region can inhibit food intake and reduce body weight (4Sheng G. Chang G.Q. Lin J.Y. Yu Z.X. Fang Z.H. Rong J. Lipton S.A. Li S.H. Tong G. Leibowitz S.F. Li X.J. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because orexin neurons also regulate food intake (24Koob G.F. Neuron. 2008; 59: 11-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 25Carter M.E. Borg J.S. de Lecea L. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2009; 9: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we wondered whether selective inhibition of Hap1 in orexin neurons would cause any abnormal feeding behavior. We monitored the body weight of Orexin-Hap1−/−mice along with control (wild-type or Orexin-Hap1+/−) mice from birth until the age of 100 days. At birth all the pups had similar weights, regardless of their genotype or gender (Fig. 3A). However, control mice gained more weight than Orexin-Hap1−/− mice, with the greatest differences seen at the ages of 2–4 weeks (Fig. 3B). For example, male Orexin-Hap1−/− mice had a body weight only 67% of the control mice at the age of 16 days; however, there was no significant difference seen between control and mutant males at the end of recording or at ages over 100 days, suggesting that Hap1 in orexin neurons may be more important for early animal development and growth. We also recorded food and water consumption by male and female Orexin-Hap1−/− mice and their age- and sex-matched controls at the ages of 1–3 months. Because there was a body weight difference between the two groups examined, we normalized the daily diet consumption of each mouse by its body weight on the same day and found that there was still a significant reduction of food intake for Orexin-Hap1−/− mice (Fig. 3C). The male and female Orexin-Hap1−/− mice consumed 66 and 50%, respectively, of the food that control mice ate (Fig. 3C); however, the water consumption was similar for these two groups of mice (Fig. 3D). Thus, the elimination of Hap1 in orexin neurons appears to selectively inhibit food intake and lower the body weight of mice at ages <100 days. In addition to regulating feeding behavior, orexin neurons also modulate sleep/wakefulness or motor arousal (26Willie J.T. Chemelli R.M. Sinton C.M. Yanagisawa M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 429-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). We therefore chose to compare the locomotor activity of Orexin-Hap1−/− mice with control mice. Both control and Orexin-Hap1−/− male mice showed little physical activity during the daytime and arose and became active during the night (Fig. 4A), which is typical rodent arousal behavior. Orexin-Hap1−/− mice, however, showed less activity than the control mice (Orexin-Hap1+/−) at night. This reduced activity was more prominent in female Orexin-Hap1−/− mice than in male Orexin-Hap1−/− mice. Because a fasting-induced reduction in locomotor activity was seen in other mutant mice with orexin neuronal defects (27Yoshida G. Li M.X. Horiuchi M. Nakagawa S. Sakata M. Kuchiiwa S. Kuchiiwa T. Jalil M.A. Begum L. Lu Y.B. Iijima M. Hanada T. Nakazato M. Huang Z.L. Eguchi N. Kobayashi K. Saheki T. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 55: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we also examined the locomotor activity of fasted mice. Fasting, which causes metabolic stress, led to a greater decrease in the locomotor activity of Orexin-Hap1−/− mice than the control mice, suggesting that Hap1 is also involved in the response of the body to metabolic stress. Again, female Orexin-Hap1−/− mice showed a more marked reduction in locomotor activity than female control mice (Fig. 4B). Statistical analysis of the nighttime activities of the mice also revealed a greater reduction in female Orexin-Hap1−/− mice than in male Orexin-Hap1−/− mice, regardless of their feeding status (Fig. 4C). Thus, orexin neurons with Hap1 deficiency were less able to stimulate locomotor arousal, and this defect was more prominent in female mice. Although the mechanism underlying this sex-dependent phenomenon remains to be investigated, our data suggest a role for Hap1 in orexin neuronal activities and associated animal behaviors. Early studies have shown that suppressing Hap1 expression in cultured PC12 cells can inhibit neurite extension (14Rong J. McGuire J.R. Fang Z.H. Sheng G. Shin J.Y. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6019-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar); what remains unclear is whether Hap1 deficiency can also affect neuronal processes in the brain. Orexin neurons are a small group of neurons located in the lateral hypothalamic area, making it easy for us to observe the distribution of their neurites. In low power images of immunohistochemical staining of orexin-A, we noticed a higher density of processes of orexin neurons in control mice (Fig. 5). However, orexin neurons in the Orexin-Hap1−/− mouse brain displayed disrupted or fragmented neurites in the dorsomedial hypothalamic (Fig. 5A) and the lateral hypothalamic (Fig. 5B) nuclei, which is more prominent in the high power images. Although it is difficult to quantify neuritic density, we have confirmed this neuritic defect in Hap1-deficient orexin neurons by comparing 30 brain sections from five wild-type and five Hap1-deficient mice. Our finding provides strong in vivo evidence for the necessity of Hap1 in maintaining neuronal processes in the brain. Intracellular trafficking is essential for supplying nutrients, molecules, and organelles to nerve terminals to maintain the normal function and morphology of neuronal processes. Hap1 is known to be involved in intracellular trafficking (6Li X.J. Li S.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and its deficiency may alter the trafficking of multiple proteins. Although our early studies have demonstrated the trafficking defect in live cultured primary neurons that lack Hap1 (10McGuire J.R. Rong J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), the live cell imaging approach has limitations to reveal the changes of multiple trafficking proteins. For these reasons, we performed sucrose gradient fractionation, which can uncover altered distribution of various proteins in multiple compartments. Adult mouse brain homogenates were separated by centrifugation on sucrose density gradients (5–45%), and fractions were analyzed for the presence of Hap1 and organelle marker proteins. This assay revealed that, in wild-type mouse brains, Hap1 is widely distributed in various fractions but is more enriched in the fractions that contain endosome, Golgi complex, and synaptic vesicle marker proteins (Fig. 6). This distribution fits with the feature of a trafficking protein that associates with cargos for microtubule-dependent transport. Both Hap1 isoforms (Hap1A and Hap1B) are present in the low density fractions, but only Hap1A is present in the high density fractions (Fig. 6). Because synaptosome components syntaxin and PSD95 are distributed mainly in these high density fractions, the high density fractions generated by our procedure are indeed enriched in synaptosomes. The difference in the distribution of Hap1A and Hap1B in sucrose gradient fractions suggests that Hap1A is more likely to associate with synaptic vesicles or other organelles in nerve terminals. Furthermore, phosphorylated Hap1A (pHap1A) is seen in the low density fractions but not high density fractions. These differences are consistent with our early finding that Hap1A is more enriched in the neuronal processes and tips of PC12 cells and also support the hypothesis that dephosphorylated Hap1A is more likely to localize in nerve terminals (14Rong J. McGuire J.R. Fang Z.H. Sheng G. Shin J.Y. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6019-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Next, we compared the distribution of a variety of proteins in the sucrose gradient fractions using the brain samples from wild-type and Hap1 null pups at postnatal days 1 and 2. This comparison demonstrates a decrease in the trafficking proteins, KLC and dynectin p150glued (p150), and in the fractions that are enriched in synaptic vesicle proteins (Fig. 7A). KLC1, KLC2, and P150 are microtubule-dependent transporters associated with motor molecules that are responsible for anterograde and retrograde transport, respectively. It seems that proteins that bind directly to Hap1 show a greater decrease in the high density fractions. There is less KLC2 than KLC1 in the high density sucrose fractions. This may be because KLC2 directly binds Hap1 (10McGuire J.R. Rong J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) such that lack of Hap1 has more impact on its transport and distribution. Consistently, both htt and P150 are known as Hap1-interacting partners (1Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H."
https://openalex.org/W2169129792,"Mdm2 binding protein (MTBP) has been implicated in cell-cycle arrest and the Mdm2/p53 tumor suppressor pathway through its interaction with Mdm2. To determine the function of MTBP in tumorigenesis and its potential role in the Mdm2/p53 pathway, we crossed Mtbp-deficient mice to Emu-myc transgenic mice, in which overexpression of the oncogene c-Myc induces B-cell lymphomas primarily through inactivation of the Mdm2/p53 pathway. We report that Myc-induced B-cell lymphoma development in Mtbp heterozygous mice was profoundly delayed. Surprisingly, reduced levels of Mtbp did not lead to an increase in B-cell apoptosis or affect Mdm2. Instead, an Mtbp deficiency inhibited Myc-induced proliferation and the upregulation of Myc target genes necessary for cell growth. Consistent with a role in proliferation, Mtbp expression was induced by Myc and other factors that promote cell-cycle progression and was elevated in lymphomas from humans and mice. Therefore, Mtbp functioned independent of Mdm2 and was a limiting factor for the proliferative and transforming functions of Myc. Thus, Mtbp is a previously unrecognized regulator of Myc-induced tumorigenesis."

IntroductionA variety of genetic diseases and experimental situations within the heterozygous state depict an allelic relationship where the mutant recessive allele overrides the function of its normal (wild type) dominant allele. This condition, referred to as dominant negative, is usually observed in the case of oligomeric or multidomain proteins with a possibility of cross-monomer interaction. Such mutant proteins by acting as competitive inhibitors of the normal protein function could generate polymorphic forms in a single cell. A phenomenon observed in collagen, where dominant negative mutations cause the production of abnormal oligomers (1Jacenko O. LuValle P. Solum K. Olsen B.R. Prog. Clin. Biol.

It is necessary for cellular division irrespective of the type of tissue and reappears during cellular division and tumor formation (14Mazurek S. Boschek C.B. Hugo F. Eigenbrodt E. Semin.

PKM2 is known to regulate its activity by switching between an active tetramer and inactive dimer form in a fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-dependent manner to shift the cellular metabolism accordingly during cell division. Hence, its role is implicated in cancer progression (14Mazurek S. Boschek C.B. Hugo F. Eigenbrodt E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Because any known aberration of PKM2 is not yet observed in more than one naturally occurring pathological condition, its role as a “metabolic modulator” has remained enigmatic.This study deals with two missense mutations detected by us from a patient with BS, prone to various types of cancers at early age, and a BS cell line (18Anitha M. Kaur G. Baquer N.Z. Bamezai R. DNA Cell Biol. 2004; 23: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Reddy B.S. Kochhar A.M. Anitha M. Bamezai R. Int. J. Dermatol. 2000; 39: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Both K422R and H391Y mutant proteins individually were shown to maintain tetrameric structure, despite mutations in the ISCD domain, while showing a differential loss of activity. One of the mutants, H391Y, had shown a significant structural rigidity, thermostability, stability over a range of pH, and a loss of typical allosteric behavior. We hypothesized how a multifunctional protein modulates its structure and regulates its function to adapt to stressful conditions like cancer to favor tumor promotion (20Akhtar K. Gupta V. Koul A. Alam N. Bhat R. Bamezai R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11971-11981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because the mutations observed were dominant negative in nature and were observed in vivo under heterozygous conditions, it was pertinent to understand the nature of interaction between wild type and mutant proteins under bi-allelic expression conditions. The cross-monomer interactions between wild type and mutant PKM2 shifted a tetramer ensemble to less active dimeric and heterotetrameric forms, adding another dimension to the mechanism of alteration of PKM2 activity, as a result of dominant negative mutation with its functional relevance.DISCUSSIONThe observation of two novel mutations in the ISCD region of PKM2 accounting for its reduced activity in BS cells (18Anitha M. Kaur G. Baquer N.Z. Bamezai R. DNA Cell Biol. 2004; 23: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Reddy B.S. Kochhar A.M. Anitha M. Bamezai R. Int. J. Dermatol. 2000; 39: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) followed the discovery of mutant BLM gene as an etiological factor for the syndrome (29Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). Incidentally, the defective BLM protein does not explain a number of clinical symptoms observed in the syndrome (30Bamezai R. Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1996; 34: 298-301PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, ∼7% (9/134) of BS patients lack BLM mutations, 3James German, personal communication. and many available BS cell lines show down-regulated PKM2 activity. 4A. Mammalapali, N. Z. Baquer, and R. N. K. Bamezai, unpublished data. It was therefore pertinent to understand the mechanism of the down-regulation of PKM2 activity and its functional implication to infer the role the isozyme could play in a cell. We have proposed earlier that structural modulation in PKM2 mutant proteins may facilitate tumor survival, incidentally one of the key features of BS (20Akhtar K. Gupta V. Koul A. Alam N. Bhat R. Bamezai R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11971-11981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear if a genetically inherent tendency for stabilization of the PKM2 dimer and other less active oligomeric forms of PKM2, as observed in this study, provides a unique way for activity regulation with a possible clue for genetic predisposition to cancer development in BS patients.PKM2 Mutants Follow a Unique Pathway to Down-regulate Their Activities with Differential AffinityThe mechanism of alteration of PKM2 activity due to mutations was understood by yeast two-hybrid assay and confirmed by GST pulldown. The negative result in the “standard GST pulldown assay,” where the homotetrameric wild type as well as mutant proteins were mixed, provided the clue that the interaction was not simply a tetramer-tetramer association. However, co-expression of two proteins, mimicking in vivo heterozygous condition, provided a chance of protein-protein interaction at monomer level. Hence, a positive interaction observed only in a modified pulldown assay essentially depicted the hetero-oligomerization tendency of wild type and mutant proteins through cross-monomer mixing, a possible reflection of what happens in BS cells. In silico study provided an elementary clue about the existence of hetero-oligomers where the higher stability in terms of Gibbs free energy of each possible species, including mutant homotetramers, suggested an increased probability of their formation in cellular milieu. The proposed in silico hypothesis was validated by glycerol gradient experiments where a single peak of wild type as well as mutant PKM2 tetramer, when expressed independently (20Akhtar K. Gupta V. Koul A. Alam N. Bhat R. Bamezai R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11971-11981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) or in a natural condition in a cancer cell line (supplemental Fig. S6) (31Shimada N. Shinagawa T. Ishii S. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was found to split into five distinct peaks in accordance to their molecular weight (Fig. 3, C–E). The lower activity of GST-fused wild type homotetramers represented by peak 5 in the case of wild type-mutant co-expression (Fig. 3, D and E), depicted the reduced tendency for wild type homotetramerization. This corroborated with what was predicted in silico, suggesting that the stability of hetero-oligomers was high enough and left only a lower probability for homotetramer formation (Fig. 2C), which would have been 50% if the mutations were heterozygous and not dominant negative. It is likely that the higher stability of heterodimers is due to predicted extra unique H-bonds within the ISCD of wild type and mutant monomers, which also explains the higher tendency of H391Y mutant dimerization than the K422R mutant (supplemental Fig. S5). Incidentally, the higher dimer/tetramer ratio observed in the case of co-expression of wild type and mutant PKM2 in mammalian cells (supplemental Figs. S8 and S9), in comparison with the E. coli system, we suggest is a consequence of altered metabolic programming of the mammalian cells, essential for proliferation (32Mazurek S. Boschek C.B. Eigenbrodt E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). All proliferating mammalians cells have a tendency to dimerize a significant portion of tetrameric PKM2 (supplemental Fig. S6) as observed earlier (14Mazurek S. Boschek C.B. Hugo F. Eigenbrodt E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 31Shimada N. Shinagawa T. Ishii S. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), contributing positively to the mutation-driven tendency of dimerization in protein when expressed in the presence of PK-WT and an endogenous background expression of wild type PKM2. Nevertheless, the well resolved peaks representing tetrameric molecules depict the presence of hetero-oligomers (supplemental Figs. S7–S9) as observed in E. coli cells (Fig. 3, C–E), the latter representing a relatively advantageous unbiased model to study the natural tendency of hetero-oligomerization of wild type and mutant PKM2.Allosteric proteins exist in a complex ensemble of conformers, where ligand binding to them does not induce conformational changes, rather it stabilizes the pre-existing active conformers to make them functional (33Goodey N.M. Benkovic S.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 34Cole R. Loria J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6072-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, the altered affinity on binding to P-enolpyruvate, as observed (Fig. 4B), leads to a differential stability and differential shift in the ensemble, which potentially altered the functional impact of PKM2 in the cell. Our previous study (20Akhtar K. Gupta V. Koul A. Alam N. Bhat R. Bamezai R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11971-11981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed that despite having mutations within the ISCD region, both the mutants showed differential impact over P-enolpyruvate affinity in comparison with PKWT. The increased affinity for P-enolpyruvate in the experiments of co-expression of H391Y with PK-WT was due to its intrinsic environment of amino acid residue interaction as described previously (20Akhtar K. Gupta V. Koul A. Alam N. Bhat R. Bamezai R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11971-11981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the co-expression of this mutant lost significant affinity when compared with its independent expression (Km = 0.078 ± 0.009 mm) (20Akhtar K. Gupta V. Koul A. Alam N. Bhat R. Bamezai R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11971-11981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Instead, the K422R mutant showed an increased affinity (Km = 0.698 ± 0.06 mm) in comparison with its independent expression (1.5 mm ± 0.1) but was significantly lower than the PKWT (0.146 ± 0.02 mm). The co-expressions of wild type and mutant proteins have a significant differential impact over the activity of proteins in comparison with their individual expression as observed earlier (20Akhtar K. Gupta V. Koul A. Alam N. Bhat R. Bamezai R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11971-11981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and as a consequence of cross-monomer mixing. Fully active PK-WT lost ∼60% of activity when expressed with H391Y mutant, which in turn is 80% active when expressed alone (Fig. 4A). The differential loss of activity is essentially a result of the sequestering of wild type monomers by mutant proteins (dominant negative effect), proved by modified GST pulldown and glycerol gradient assay. The reduced activity of hetero-oligomers observed as a result of heterogeneity of amino acid residues at the ISCD region rendered the signal transduction ineffective.Co-expression of Wild Type and Mutant PKM2 Induces Accelerated Cell Proliferation and PolyploidyBiological importance of the preferential hetero-oligomerization of PKM2 was reflected in the observation of enhanced cellular proliferation in bacterial and mammalian cells expressing the less active altered ensembles of PKM2. The reduction of PKM2 activity by subunit dissociation (dimerization) is known to block the glycolysis at the last step, allowing the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates. These intermediates are used as synthetic precursors at the time of cell division (14Mazurek S. Boschek C.B. Hugo F. Eigenbrodt E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The tumor incidentally needs a permanent supply of these intermediates; hence, permanent down-regulation of PKM2 activity by stable dimer formation provides a favorable condition for tumor development (14Mazurek S. Boschek C.B. Hugo F. Eigenbrodt E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 32Mazurek S. Boschek C.B. Eigenbrodt E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 35Mazurek S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Many oncogenic viral proteins are known to dimerize the PKM2 tetramer by physically interacting with it (36Zwerschke W. Mazurek S. Massimi P. Banks L. Eigenbrodt E. Jansen-Dürr P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 37Presek P. Reinacher M. Eigenbrodt E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 242: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), although recently, up-regulation of PKM2 expression and its activity down-regulation have been shown to be involved in in vivo development of cancer (15Christofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Ramanathan A. Gerszten R.E. Wei R. Fleming M.D. Schreiber S.L. Cantley L.C. Nature. 2008; 452: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar, 38Christofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Wu N. Asara J.M. Cantley L.C. Nature. 2008; 452: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). The feature of stabilization of PKM2 dimers is observed in cancer cells (supplemental Fig. S6) and has been used as a diagnostic feature (39Hardt P.D. Ewald N. Expert Rev. Mol. Diagn. 2008; 8: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 40Hardt P.D. Mazurek S. Toepler M. Schlierbach P. Bretzel R.G. Eigenbrodt E. Kloer H.U. Br. J. Cancer. 2004; 91: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 41Mazurek S. Ernst. Schering. Found. Symp. Proc. 2007; 4: 99-124PubMed Google Scholar).The expression of mutations in a heterozygous condition showed an inherent tendency of disturbing tetramer/dimer equilibrium by favoring the dimerization, therefore leading to accelerated cellular growth (Fig. 5, B–I, and Table 1), a prerequisite for cancer development. Although expression of PK-WT itself is a cell growth-promoting factor (Fig. 5, D and G), however, the mutant forms contribute to this phenomenon more than the wild type PKM2 (Fig. 5, E, F, H, and I). This in all probability is a result of relatively lowered activity and affinity of the hetero-oligomerized proteins, including the heterodimers. Polyploidy rate enhancement was an interesting observation that occurred in the cells co-expressing the mutant PKM2 along with the wild type proteins (Table 1), supporting the important role of the cross-monomer interactions of PKM2 and their reduced enzyme activity in sustaining neoplastic transformation and generating genomic instability as observed in BS (42Storchova Z. Pellman D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Incidentally, the increased growth rate of E. coli as well as mammalian cells in response to the expression of a human protein (mutant PKM2) (Fig. 5A) indicates its evolutionary importance of highly conserved structure of PK from E. coli to humans. Apparently, overexpressed human PKM2 shows a potential to replace the E. coli pyruvate kinase in the bacterial glycolytic complex, suggesting that E. coli could be used as a good model to study the effect of some conserved proteins and the role of their mutants.The down-regulation of PKM2 activity had a direct co-relation with an increased cellular growth. The observation of H391Y mutant hetero-oligomer expression induces relatively more cellular growth and polyploidy than its individual expression, and K422R hetero-oligomer expression with lowered activity provides further support to our conclusion. Our previous observation of PKM2 deficiency in more than one BS cell line without any PKM2 mutation4 suggests that this down-regulation of the activity may happen irrespective of mutations in BS condition where stabilization of the PKM2 dimer or less active tetramers, through as yet unknown mechanisms, provides an inherent susceptibility to tumor development in early life in the syndrome.Modulated PKM2 Can Justify Other Features of Bloom Syndrome, a HypothesisHuman PKM2 has recently emerged as a multifunctional protein, and many of its nonglycolytic functions are little understood. A direct interaction of PKM2 with cytoplasmic promyelocytic leukemia tumor suppressor protein and the co-localization of BLM with promyelocytic leukemia in maintaining genome stability (31Shimada N. Shinagawa T. Ishii S. Genes Cells. 2008; 13: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 43Zhong S. Hu P. Ye T.Z. Stan R. Ellis N.A. Pandolfi P.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7941-7947Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) indicate an indirect role of PKM2 in genome stability. The observation of an increased rate of polyploidy in this study opens up an area of investigation in this direction. Reports have also shown the involvement of pyruvate kinase polymorphism in association with type II diabetes (44Wang H. Chu W. Das S.K. Ren Q. Hasstedt S.J. Elbein S.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2861-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We propose that an activity-deficient PKM2 would not metabolize glucose despite having enough insulin in the blood, thus providing a reason for the occurrence of a type II diabetes-like situation observed in some BS patients. A defective PKM2 has the potential to create an imbalance in the equilibrium in growth and apoptosis (45Steták A. Veress R. Ovádi J. Csermely P. Kéri G. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 46Hoshino A. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17706-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) thus resulting in growth retardation in BS. Similarly, a defective sperm-specific pyruvate kinase would be unable to maintain normal glycolysis, crucial for sperm mobility (47Feiden S. Stypa H. Wolfrum U. Wegener G. Kamp G. Reproduction. 2007; 134: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 48Miki K. Qu W. Goulding E.H. Willis W.D. Bunch D.O. Strader L.F. Perreault S.D. Eddy E.M. O'Brien D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 16501-16506Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), to explain male-specific infertility in BS. Also, PKM2 has been reported to interact with microtubules physically (49Vértessy B.G. Bánkfalvi D. Kovács J. Löw P. Lehotzky A. Ovádi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with the possibility to affect the motility of microtubule-rich cells like sperm cells. The feature of facial erythema observed in BS patients again could be explained by an allergic reaction due to PKM2-dependent “mast cell degranulation,” responsible for hypersensitivity (50Ryu H. Walker J.K. Kim S. Koo N. Barak L.S. Noguchi T. Kang B.Y. Kim K.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 154: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).ConclusionA large number of multifunctional oligomeric proteins in evolution have emerged to handle multiple functions simultaneously; however, sometime their defective status results in susceptibility to a particular disease. An important glycolytic protein, the PKM2, has turned out to be one such candidate, involved not only in glycolysis but also in a variety of cellular functions. We have shown that the down-regulation of PKM2 activity is due to an inherent tendency to express as dimers or other less active forms and is directly correlated with an increased rate of cell cycle and polyploidy, the hallmark of cancer cells, the feature common to BS patients. This mimics the heterozygous status of this gene in Bloom syndrome conditions. This study not only signifies the importance of highly conserved amino acid residues at critical positions that can aid one to understand the long range communication in allosteric proteins (33Goodey N.M. Benkovic S.J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), but also indicates the potential therapeutic role of PKM2 by supplementing the normal PKM2. After all, curing of BS cellular features through BLM transfection (51Ellis N.A. Proytcheva M. Sanz M.M. Ye T.Z. German J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1368-1374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and simple co-cultivation with normal cells (52Bamezai R. Shiraishi Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 164: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 53Bamezai R. Shiraishi Y. Hum. Genet. 1987; 75: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) in in vitro studies have indicated such a potential. IntroductionA variety of genetic diseases and experimental situations within the heterozygous state depict an allelic relationship where the mutant recessive allele overrides the function of its normal (wild type) dominant allele. This condition, referred to as dominant negative, is usually observed in the case of oligomeric or multidomain proteins with a possibility of cross-monomer interaction. Such mutant proteins by acting as competitive inhibitors of the normal protein function could generate polymorphic forms in a single cell. A phenomenon observed in collagen, where dominant negative mutations cause the production of abnormal oligomers (1Jacenko O. LuValle P. Solum K. Olsen B.R. Prog. Clin. Biol.

Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and in transcription factors like helix-loop-helix and leucine zippers, where mutant monomers sequestering the function of wild type in a dimer bound to DNA, leads to an altered gene expression (3Barndt R.J.

PKM2 is known to regulate its activity by switching between an active tetramer and inactive dimer form in a fructose 1,6-bisphosphate-dependent manner to shift the cellular metabolism accordingly during cell division. Hence, its role is implicated in cancer progression (14Mazurek S. Boschek C.B. Hugo F. Eigenbrodt E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Because any known aberration of PKM2 is not yet observed in more than one naturally occurring pathological condition, its role as a “metabolic modulator” has remained enigmatic.This study deals with two missense mutations detected by us from a patient with BS, prone to various types of cancers at early age, and a BS cell line (18Anitha M.

Both K422R and H391Y mutant proteins individually were shown to maintain tetrameric structure, despite mutations in the ISCD domain, while showing a differential loss of activity. One of the mutants, H391Y, had shown a significant structural rigidity, thermostability, stability over a range of pH, and a loss of typical allosteric behavior. We hypothesized how a multifunctional protein modulates its structure and regulates its function to adapt to stressful conditions like cancer to favor tumor promotion (20Akhtar K. Gupta V. Koul A.

Because the mutations observed were dominant negative in nature and were observed in vivo under heterozygous conditions, it was pertinent to understand the nature of interaction between wild type and mutant proteins under bi-allelic expression conditions. The cross-monomer interactions between wild type and mutant PKM2 shifted a tetramer ensemble to less active dimeric and heterotetrameric forms, adding another dimension to the mechanism of alteration of PKM2 activity, as a result of dominant negative mutation with its functional relevance."

To enable engineering of a stable monoclonal antibody hinge, we investigated the role of the hinge His229 residue using structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. Direct involvement of His229 in the reaction mechanism is suggested by a 75–85% reduction of the hinge cleavage for variants in which His229 was substituted with either Gln, Ser, or Ala. In contrast, mutation of Lys227 to Gln, Ser, or Ala increased hinge cleavage. However, the H229S/K227S double mutant shows hinge cleavage levels similar to that of the single H229S variant, further revealing the importance of His229. Examination of the hinge structure shows that His229 is capable of forming hydrogen bonds with surrounding residues. These observations led us to hypothesize that the imidazole ring of His229 may function to facilitate the cleavage by forming a transient radical center that is capable of extracting a proton from neighboring residues. The work presented here suggests the feasibility of engineering a new generation of monoclonal antibodies capable of resisting hinge cleavage to improve product stability and efficacy.

https://openalex.org/W2026802402,"The use of c-abl-specific inhibitors such as Imatinib (IM) or Dasatinib has revolutionized the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, a significant percentage of patients become resistant to IM. In this report, we have analyzed the possibility of using the proteasome as a molecular target in CML. Our results show that cells that express Bcr-Abl1 are more sensitive to the inhibition of the proteasome with Bortezomib (Btz) than control cells. This treatment reduces the proliferation of Bcr-Abl1-expressing cells, by inactivating NF-κB2 and decreasing the phosphorylation of Rb, eventually leading to an increase in caspase-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that Btz also induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in cells expressing Bcr-Abl1 mutants that are resistant to IM. These results unravel a new molecular target of Btz, that is the Rb pathway, and open new possibilities in the treatment of CML especially for patients that become resistant to IM because of the presence of the T315I mutation."

Antigen-mediated cross-linking of IgE-loaded FcϵRI α-chains induces cell activation via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in associated signaling subunits, such as FcϵRI γ-chains. Here we show that the human FcϵRI α-chain can efficiently reach the cell surface by itself as an IgE-binding receptor in the absence of associated signaling subunits when the endogenous signal peptide is swapped for that of murine major histocompatibility complex class-I H2-Kb. This single-chain isoform of FcϵRI exited the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), trafficked to the Golgi and, subsequently, trafficked to the cell surface. Mutational analysis showed that the signal peptide regulates surface expression in concert with other described ER retention signals of FcϵRI-α. Once the FcϵRI α-chain reached the cell surface by itself, it formed a ligand-binding receptor that stabilized upon IgE contact. Independently of the FcϵRI γ-chain, this single-chain FcϵRI was internalized after receptor cross-linking and trafficked into a LAMP-1-positive lysosomal compartment like multimeric FcϵRI. These data suggest that the single-chain isoform is capable of shuttling IgE-antigen complexes into antigen loading compartments, which plays an important physiologic role in the initiation of immune responses toward allergens. We propose that, in addition to cytosolic and transmembrane ER retention signals, the FcϵRI α-chain signal peptide contains a negative regulatory signal that prevents expression of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-free IgE receptor pool, which would fail to induce cell activation.

Topoisomerase II (Topo II), another binding partner of TopBP1, decatenates sister chromatids that become intertwined during replication. Inhibition of Topo II by ICRF-193 (meso-4,4′-(3,2-butanediyl)-bis-(2,6-piperazinedione)), a catalytic inhibitor that does not induce DNA double-strand breaks, causes a mitotic delay known as the G2 decatenation checkpoint. Here, we demonstrate that this checkpoint, dependent on ATR and BRCA1, also requires Rad9A. Analysis of different Rad9A phosphorylation mutants suggests that these modifications are required to prevent endoreduplication and to maintain decatenation checkpoint arrest. Furthermore, Rad9A Ser272 is phosphorylated in response to Topo II inhibition. ICRF-193 treatment also causes phosphorylation of an effector kinase downstream of Rad9A in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, Chk2, at Thr68. Both of these sites are major targets of phosphorylation by the ATM kinase, although it has previously been shown that ATM is not required for the decatenation checkpoint. Examination of ataxia telangectasia (A-T) cells demonstrates that ATR does not compensate for ATM loss, suggesting that phosphorylation of Rad9A and Chk2 by ATM plays an additional role in response to Topo II inhibition than checkpoint function alone. Finally, we have shown that murine embryonic stem cells deficient for Rad9A have higher levels of catenated mitotic spreads than wild-type counterparts.

Mutation or altered expression of checkpoint genes can result in genetic instability, leading to polyploidy, aneuploidy, and tumorgenicity.

G2 checkpoint protein Rad9A is one of three proteins that sense damaged DNA, forming a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-like heterotrimeric ring around DNA, known as the 911 complex (3St. Onge R.P.

Many damage-induced ATM substrates are, however, critical to the checkpoint, such as phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr68 (12Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Chk2 is an effector kinase downstream of ATM that suppresses the activation of the mitotic switch Cdc2/Cyclin B1 (12Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Mutations in Chk2 are found in patients with a form of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, characterized by hereditary and sporadic cancers akin to those caused by p53 mutation, underscoring the importance of p53 targeting by Chk2 in G1 checkpoint signaling pathways (14Bell D.W.

Science. 1999; 286: 2528-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Chk2 Thr68 is the major site of IR-induced phosphorylation by ATM and when activated, targets Cdc25C, a major point of convergence of the G2 checkpoint (12Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y.

Science. 1998; 282: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Chk2 also interacts with Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), which regulates chromosomal segregation, and mitotic entry and exit, whereas Chk2 itself is localized to centrosomes in undamaged cell (15Tsvetkov L. Xu X. Li J. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8468-8475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that inhibition of Chk2 causes failure of mitotic arrest, resulting in mitotic catastrophe and cell death, linking Chk2 activity to prevention of abnormal mitoses (16Castedo M. Perfettini J.L. Roumier T. Valent A. Raslova H. Yakushijin K. Horne D. Feunteun J. Lenoir G. Medema R. Vainchenker W. Kroemer G.

Acta. 2008; 1783: 2223-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that BRCA1 phosphorylation is dependent on Chk2 during the spindle assembly checkpoint and that this is required for successful chromosomal separation. Successful separation of mitotic chromosomes is dependent on Topo II, which decatenates sister chromatids that become tangled during replication. Inhibition of Topo II decatenation activity by bisdioxopiperazine ICRF-193, a catalytic inhibitor that stabilizes Topo II in the closed clamp conformation and initiates a checkpoint-mediated mitotic delay (18Downes C.S.

Res. 1998; 400: 153-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). What is known about the decatenation checkpoint signaling pathway scaffold is reminiscent of the G2 checkpoints, as it is activated by ATR and ultimately targets Cdc2/Cyclin B1 (20Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cells expressing ATR kinase mutants do not demonstrate mitotic arrest in response to ICRF-193 treatment, but rather proceed through aberrant mitosis resulting in chromosomal aberrations (20Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Conversely, ATM is not required to initiate decatenation checkpoint signaling (20Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Although ATM is not required for the decatenation checkpoint, ICRF-193 treatment leads to autophosphorylation at Ser1981, suggesting that ATM plays an overlapping, nonessential role in this pathway (20Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 21Nakagawa T.

The main downstream effector of ATR activation, Chk1, is not phosphorylated at Ser317 or Ser345, nor was Chk2 reported to become hyperphosphorylated (20Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R.

Instead, the decatenation checkpoint causes cytoplasmic accumulation of Cyclin B1, sequestering the functional mitotic Cdk complex away from the nucleus, thereby arresting cells in G2; this arrest can be overridden by expression of an exclusively nuclear Cyclin B1 (20Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 12044-12049Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Deming P.B.

Decatenation and the decatenation checkpoint are also dependent on the BRCA1 and WRN proteins. BRCA1 is phosphorylated in an ATR-dependent manner when Topo II is inhibited, and both BRCA1 and WRN (the RecQ helicase that is mutated in Werner syndrome) are necessary for proper decatenation of chromosomes (20Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R. Piwnica-Worms H. Paules R.S. Downes C.S. Kaufmann W.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Chen J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, fission yeast RecQ helicase homolog Rad12 has been illustrated to function upstream of Rad9 in regulating exit from the S phase checkpoint (25Davey S. Han C.S. Ramer S.A. Klassen J.C. Jacobson A. Eisenberger A. Hopkins K.M. Lieberman H.B. Freyer G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2721-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This suggests that resolution of altered chromosome structure by the RecQ class of helicases and Topo II is linked to the function of genomic surveyors such as Rad9A. However, no mammalian decatenation checkpoint sensors have as yet been identified. Here, we demonstrate that Rad9A is required for the decatenation checkpoint. Although Rad9A is inducibly phosphorylated at Ser272 when Topo II activity is inhibited by ICRF-193, mutation of the constitutive phosphorylation sites of Rad9A abrogates decatenation checkpoint activity. Moreover, when these sites are mutated, cells demonstrate endoreduplication, which is associated with ploidy defects and severe genomic instability. Rad9A deficiency is also associated with high levels of catenation detected in mitotic spreads after ICRF-193 treatment compared with wild-type (WT) cells. HeLa (CCL-2; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA), IMR-90 (CCL-186; ATCC), and ATM−/− (CRL-7201; ATCC) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere.

Murine embryonic stem (mES) cells, both WT and containing a genomic deletion of the rad9A gene, were a gift from Dr. Howard Lieberman of Columbia University of New York, NY. mES cells were maintained in gelatinized culture dishes in KnockOut Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with the following: 15% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (ES qualified; Invitrogen), 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (BioShop, Burlington, Canada), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), and 103 units/ml ESGRO (Millipore, Etobicoke, Canada). Differentiation of mES cells was accomplished by growth in medium supplemented with 10 μm retinoic acid for 48 h, as described previously (26Sierant M.L. Archer N.E. Davey S.K. Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cells grown in 10-cm tissue culture dishes were washed twice with PBS, lysed in NETN buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) supplemented with 0.5 mm AEBSF (BioShop), 20 μg/ml aprotinin (BioShop), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (BioShop), 10 μg/ml pepstatin A (BioShop), 1 mm Na3VO4 (ICN), 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate (Sigma), and 10 mm NaF (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Canada), and removed by scraping. Lysates were incubated on ice for 60 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated to 95°C for 5 min. Samples for immunoblotting were treated as described (11Greer D.A. Besley B.D. Kennedy K.B. Davey S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4829-4835PubMed Google Scholar).

Rabbit polyclonal phospho-specific antibodies directed toward Chk2 Thr68 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the pluripotency marker Oct4 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated α-rabbit (Bio-Rad) secondary antibodies were used for Rad9A Ser272, Thr292, and Chk2 Thr68 Western blots. Chicken polyclonal (IgY) antibodies directed against Rad9A have been described previously (6St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol.

Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Following a 4-h release into complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (before cells had cycled into G2), synchronized cells were treated with 10 μm ICRF-193 and 0.1 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) as indicated for a further 4 h. Cells synchronized to mitosis and asynchronous cells and were then washed twice in PBS and harvested by trypsinization. Cells were washed in PBS twice more, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. Ice-cold ethanol (5 ml) was added dropwise during gentle vortexing, and samples were incubated at 4 °C overnight. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and treated with 0.1 mg/ml RNaseA (BioShop) for 20 min. Approximately 1 × 106 cells from each sample were incubated with 1 μg of α-phospho-histone H3 (Ser10, Upstate) diluted in 100 μl of block solution (0.5% (v/v) Tween 20/PBS containing 0.5% (v/v) normal goat serum) for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were then washed in 5 ml of PBS and resuspended in 0.1 μg/μl Alexa Fluor 488 goat α-rabbit diluted in 100 μl of block, for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were then washed in 3 ml of PBS and resuspended in 80 μg/ml propidium iodide (CedarLane, Hornby, Canada) diluted in PBS. This protocol was largely based on that described in Marples et al. (28Marples B. Wouters B.G. Joiner M.C. Radiat. Res. 2003; 160: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed using a flow cytometer (Beckman/Coulter EPICS ALTRA, Mississauga, Canada). HeLa cells and Rad9A phosphorylation mutant cell lines were grown in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml ICRF-193 for 24 h, and 10 μl of Cell Proliferation Labeling reagent (Amersham Biosciences) was added for the final 30 min. Cells were then harvested, fixed in ethanol, counted, and treated with RNaseA as described above. Cells were incubated in DNA denaturation solution (0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 4 n HCl) at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then resuspended in 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5, to neutralize the acid and washed in wash solution (0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, PBS). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd (20 μl; BD Biosciences) was added to the cell pellet for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in 3 ml of PBS and resuspended in PBS containing 80 μg/ml propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman/Coulter EPICS ALTRA). Undifferentiated and differentiated mES cells were treated with 40 μg/ml colecmid for 4 h prior to harvest by trypsinization. Where indicated, cells were also treated with various concentrations of ICRF-193 for the same length of time. Cells were washed once with PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of warmed 75 mm KCl, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Cells were pelleted via centrifugation for 10 min and fixed dropwise in 1 ml of very cold 3:1 (v/v) methanol:acetic acid. Nine milliliters of fix was added, and cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were pelleted via centrifugation and washed twice more in 10 ml of very cold fix. Cells were resuspended in 0.5–1 ml of cold fix and dropped onto very cold, clean glass slides. Slides were incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 h and then mounted in Antifade Gold supplemented with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). Spreads were examined via 100× objective mounted on an Olympus IX51 inverted microscope and imaged with a Retiga 2000R digital capture system (Olympus, Markham, Canada). Catenated versus normal mitotic spreads were scored as described previously (29Damelin M. Sun Y.E. Sodja V.B. Bestor T.H. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 479-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because Topo-binding protein 1 interacts with the regulatory region of Topo II, and Topo-binding protein 1 in turn binds Rad9A (11Greer D.A. Besley B.D. Kennedy K.B. Davey S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4829-4835PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether Rad9A was monitoring this pathway. HeLa cells treated with ICRF-193 for 2 h demonstrate mitotic delay (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the phosphorylation status of Rad9A in decatenation checkpoint-arrested cells, cell lysates were immunoblotted with phospho-specific antibodies directed toward Rad9A Ser272. Rad9A Ser272 phosphorylation was evident in cells that were treated with ICRF-193, but not in undamaged cells (Fig. 1B, denoted by arrow). Phosphorylation at Rad9A Ser272 was detectable after cells had been incubated with ICRF-193 for 1 h and persisted throughout 6 h of treatment. Maximal induction of Ser272 phosphorylation was seen 4 h after treatment with ICRF-192 and represented an 8× increase over untreated cells (n = 3, p = 0.02; Fig. 1B). Similarly, a range of ICRF-193 concentrations from 5 to 100 μm resulted in the phosphorylation of Rad9A Ser272 (Fig. 1C). Treatment with 10 μm ICRF-193 for 2 h led to a 6-fold increase in Ser272 phosphorylation over untreated cells (n = 4, p = 0.01; Fig. 1C). Therefore, inhibition of Topo II by ICRF-193 results in Ser272 phosphorylation of Rad9A, suggesting that Rad9A may be participating in the decatenation checkpoint. Ser272 is the major site of Rad9A phosphorylation by ATM in response to IR (6St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Chen M.J. Lin Y.T. Lieberman H.B. Chen G. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16580-16586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine whether ATM also phosphorylates Rad9A at Ser272 when stimulated by Topo II inhibition, we evaluated the status of Rad9A Ser272 phosphorylation in A-T cells, which lack functional ATM. Normal diploid fibroblast (IMR-90) and A-T fibroblast cells were exposed to Topo II inhibition by ICRF-193 or, as a control, IR. Relative to untreated IMR-90 cells, there was a increase in Rad9A Ser272 phosphorylation following either ICRF-193 treatment (14-fold increase, n = 2, p = 0.05) or exposure to 10 Gy of IR (20-fold increase, n = 2, p = 0.01). By contrast, the same treatments do not lead to any detectable Rad9A Ser272 phosphorylation in A-T fibroblast cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, activation of the decatenation checkpoint causes phosphorylation of Rad9A at Ser272 is that is dependent on ATM. ATM is not strictly required for the decatenation checkpoint because A-T cells demonstrate an effective mitotic block when treated with ICRF-193 (20Deming P.B. Cistulli C.A. Zhao H. Graves P.R.

https://openalex.org/W2125040311,"The immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily is one of the largest families in the vertebrate genome, found most frequently in cell surface molecules. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) contains five extracellular Ig superfamily domains (D1-D5) of which the first domain, D1, is the binding site for the integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and human rhinovirus. Despite the modular nature of many Ig superfamily domains with respect to domain folding and ligand recognition, D1 does not fold on its own due to the loss of its interaction with the second domain. The goal of this study was to engineer ICAM-1 D1 by introducing mutations that would stabilize the Ig superfamily domain fold while retaining its ability to bind to LFA-1 and rhinovirus. First, with a directed evolution approach, we isolated mutations in D1 that showed binding to conformation-specific antibodies and the ligand binding domain of LFA-1 called the inserted, or I, domain. Then, with a rational design approach we introduced mutations that contributed to the stability of ICAM-1 D1 in solution. The mutations that restored native folding of D1 in isolation were those that would convert hydrogen bond networks in buried regions into hydrophobic contacts. Notably, for most mutations, identical or similar types of substitutions were found in ICAM-1 molecules of different species and other ICAM family members. The systematic approach demonstrated in this study to engineer a single Ig superfamily fold in ICAM-1 can be broadly applicable to the engineering of modular Ig superfamily domains in other cell surface molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1970646455,"NKG2D is an important activating receptor on lymphocytes. In human, it interacts with two groups of ligands: the major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A/B (MICA/B) family and the UL-16 binding protein (ULBP) family, also known as retinoic acid early transcript (RAET1). MIC proteins are membrane-anchored, but all of the ULBP/RAET1 proteins, except for RAET1E and RAET1G, are glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored. To address the reason for these differences we studied the association of RAET1G with the membrane. Using epitope-tagged RAET1G protein in conjunction with antibodies to different parts of the molecule and in pulse-chase experiments, we showed that the C terminus of the protein was cleaved soon after protein synthesis. Endoglycosidase H and peptide N-glycosidase treatment and cell surface immunoprecipitation indicated that most of the protein stayed in the endoplasmic reticulum, but some of the cleaved form was modified in the Golgi and transported to the cell surface. We examined the possibility of GPI anchoring of the protein in three ways: (i) Phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C released the PI-linked form of the protein. (ii) The surface expression pattern of RAET1G decreased in cells defective in GPI anchoring through mutant GPI-amidase. (iii) Site-directed mutagenesis, to disrupt residues predicted to facilitate GPI-anchoring, resulted in diminished surface expression of RAET1G. Thus, a form of RAET1G is GPI-anchored, in line with most other ULBP/RAET1 family proteins. The cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domains appear to result from gene duplication and frameshift mutation. Together with our previous results, our data suggest that RAET1G is regulated post-translationally to produce a GPI-anchored isoform."

The technique involves the reactivity of an introduced cysteine to sulfhydryl-specific reagents (either membrane-impermeant or permeant), thus defining protein topology. By using this analysis, TMHs I and III of SERT had been implicated as part of the substrate permeation pathway (12Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

In the current study, we used our SERT homology model to explore the extracellular surface of the substrate permeation pathway. Our SERT homology model predicts that the extracellular entrance to the permeation pathway is formed by TMHs I, III, VI, X, and XI as well as EL4. To identify structural components of SERT involved in the substrate permeation pathway, residues predicted to be at the entrance to the permeation pore were subjected to the SCAM approach using the membrane-impermeant thiol-reactive 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) (11Akabas M.H.

Further examination was performed by determining the rate of inactivation at those positions where ligand binding affected MTS reactivity. We also defined the proximities of these residues by cross-linking with bifunctional MTS reagents of different lengths. Our studies suggest that, in accordance with our model, TMHs I and VI and TMHs VI and XI are in close proximity to each other. Our data are consistent with the homology model of SERT, thus providing the opportunity to further extend SERT characterization and the possibility of developing more refined models of SERT and other members of the neurotransmitter transporter family. The QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to generate the following hSERT Cys mutants: TMH I, I108C; TMH VI, A330C, A331C, and Q332C; TMH X, T497C and G498C; EL4, E396C, V397C, and A398C. All mutations were generated in hSERT C109A background, a conserved MTS-sensitive cysteine in the first extracellular loop of SERT, thus preventing the inhibition of transport at that position by MTS reagents (22Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The following hSERT Cys double mutants were constructed using existing restriction endonuclease sites allowing exchange of sequence encoding for the Cys mutants: I108C/A330C, I108C/A331C, I108C/Q332C, I108C/E396C, F556C/A330C, F556C/A331C, and F556C/Q332C. TMHs I–VI, I-EL4, and VI–XI double mutants were constructed by excising the BsiWI-EcoNI fragment from the TMH VI or EL4 Cys mutant cDNAs and ligating this fragment into the corresponding site in the TMH I or TMH XI Cys mutant cDNA, respectively. The remaining hSERT Cys double mutants (F556C/T497C and F556C/G498C) were generated using F556C as a template to introduce the second mutation. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Michigan Sequencing Core, Ann Arbor, MI) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ vector. The ability of each Cys mutant to transport 5-HT was determined. Human embryonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin, streptomycin (10,000 units/ml), 2 mm glutamine, and 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. The cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were plated in tissue culture plates coated with poly-d-lysine 18 h prior to transfection. The cells were transiently transfected with each mutant cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 per the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the uptake assays were performed. First, cells were washed once with KRH buffer (120 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 1.8 g/liter d-glucose at pH 7.4) and then incubated in KRH buffer with or without 10 μm fluoxetine (for nonspecific or total uptake, respectively) for 10 min at 37 °C. Next, 20 nm [3H]5-HT (∼110 Ci/mmol) supplemented with 100 μm ascorbic acid and 100 μm pargyline was added to each well and incubated for another 10 min at 37 °C. The assay was terminated by washing the cells three times with KRH buffer, solubilizing with Microscint-20, and shaken overnight, and radioactivity was determined using a Packard Topcount NXT microplate scintillation counter. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). HEK-293 cells were plated, transfected, and maintained as described above. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the uptake assays were performed. Cells were washed with PBS/CM buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1.0 mm MgCl2) and then incubated in KRH buffer containing 1 mm MTSET, 10 μm fluoxetine (nonspecific uptake), or KRH buffer (total uptake) for 10 min at room temperature. The MTS reagents were made fresh in deionized water at the time of the assay. Following MTSET treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS/CM, and the [3H]5-HT uptake assay was performed as described above. For protection studies, HEK-293 cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were transiently transfected with the mutant cDNA of interest and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. At the time of the assay, the cells were preincubated with buffer, 20 μm unlabeled 5-HT, 20 μm MDMA, 200 μm MPP+, or 50 μm cocaine for 5 min at room temperature, followed by incubation in the presence or absence of MTSET for 10 min. Saturating concentrations of the ligands were used to ensure full occupancy of the transporters. Next, [3H]5-HT uptake assays were performed as described above with nonspecific uptake determined using 10 μm fluoxetine. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (GraphPad Software). HEK-293 cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were plated, transfected, and maintained at 37 °C before the assay. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed once with PBS/CM buffer and incubated with ligand (cocaine or RTI-55) for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then coincubated with increasing concentrations of MTSET in the presence or absence of ligand for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS/CM, and the [3H]5-HT uptake assay was performed as previously described. Nonspecific uptake was determined using 10 μm fluoxetine. The rate of inactivation was calculated after determining the concentration of MTSET that inhibited 50% of maximal inactivation (23Rudnick G. Transmembrane Transporters. Wiley-Liss, Inc., Hoboken, NJ2002: 125-141Crossref Google Scholar). Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (GraphPad Software). To characterize the proximity of our double cysteine mutants, we performed cross-linking studies using the bifunctional MTS reagents: 1,3-propanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate (MTS-3-MTS) and 1,4-butanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate (MTS-4-MTS). Briefly, 48 h after transient transfection, HEK-293 cells (2 × 104 cells/well) expressing the double mutant of interest were washed once with PBS/CM buffer and then incubated with 100 μm MTS-3-MTS, 100 μm MTS-4-MTS, 100 μm propyl methanethiosulfonate (PMTS) (a monofunctional MTS reagent as a control), or buffer alone (total uptake) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS/CM, and [3H]5-HT uptake assays were performed as described above. The nonspecific uptake was determined using 10 μm fluoxetine. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (GraphPad Software). HEK-293 cells were plated (5 × 105 cells/well) 18 h prior to transfection as described above. Forty-eight hours after transient transfection with each mutant cDNA, the cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 300 μl of radioimmune precipitation solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-base, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) for 30 min while shaking at 4 °C. Solubilized cells were transferred to prechilled microcentrifuge tubes, and nonsolubilized material was pelleted at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. BCA assay (Bio-Rad) was performed to determine protein concentration using an aliquot of the supernatant. Protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with an hSERT monoclonal antibody (mAB Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h. The dilution of the antibody used was 1:1000, followed by three washes in PBS/Tween solution. The blots were then incubated with a secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase) for 1 h at a dilution of 1:5000, followed by three washes in PBS/Tween solution. Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. Surface expression binding experiments were performed in 24-well plates (1 × 105 cells/well) precoated with poly-d-lysine as described previously (9Torres-Altoro M.I. White K.J. Rodríguez G.J. Nichols D.E. Barker E.L. Protein Sci. 2008; 17: 1761-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The day after plating, cells were washed once with KRH buffer. A saturating concentration (20 nm) of [3H]citalopram was used as a radiolabeled ligand for hSERT. Radiolabeled ligand and cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After incubation, cells were rapidly washed twice with KRH buffer, solubilized with a 10% SDS solution, and transferred into a scintillation vial. Bound [3H]citalopram was determined using a Beckman LS 1801 liquid scintillation counter. Total binding was established in the presence of KRH buffer. Nonspecific binding was defined as the binding of radiolabeled ligand in the presence of fluoxetine (10 μm). Internal binding was determined in the presence of MPP+ (400 μm). The generation of a human serotonin transporter homology model based on the crystal structure of the A. aeolicus leucine transporter (LeuTAa), a bacterial homologue of the Na+/Cl−-dependent transporters, provided us with the opportunity to develop a rational hypothesis for the identity of residues involved with substrate transport (5Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Molecular structure/function studies examining residues modeled at the entrance to the putative permeation pathway can provide evidence that validates directly our homology model. This model proposes that the entrance to the pore is formed by the participation of several TMHs, along with EL4. Residues modeled at the entrance to the permeation pore for hSERT were as follows: TMH I (Ile108), TMH VI (Ala330, Ala331, and Gln332), TMH X (Thr497 and Gly498), and EL4 (Glu396, Val397, and Ala398) (Fig. 1). These residues reside above the putative extracellular gate and the substrate binding site (Fig. 1A). To probe the contribution of these residues in the substrate permeation pathway, we employed the SCAM (11Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 12Chen J.G. Sachpatzidis A. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

This approach allows us to study the aqueous accessibility and sensitivity of introduced cysteines to thiol-specific reagents. We individually mutated each amino acid to a cysteine in the hSERT C109A background. This native cysteine in the first extracellular loop of SERT is known to be reactive with MTS reagents (15Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our homology model suggested that no other native cysteines were in proximity (within 10 Å) to the mutated residues, suggesting the lack of influence by these other Cys residues. All of the Cys mutants were functional for 5-HT uptake, although I108C, Q332C, V397C, T497C, and G498C exhibited reduced function (Fig. 2). Of these, the most marked loss of function due to Cys replacement was seen at Q332C. The Q332C mutant displayed 14 ± 3% transport activity compared with hSERT C109A (Fig. 2). The sensitivity of our assay system allowed us to test mutants reliably that retained at least 5% of transport function. To examine the protein expression of each Cys mutant, we performed immunoblot analysis using an hSERT-specific monoclonal antibody. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with the mutant of interest as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A 65 kDa band represented hSERT (15Henry L.K. Adkins E.M. Han Q. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37052-37063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The more mature glycosylated forms of the protein migrate around 75–80 kDa (Fig. 3A). Also, SERT is thought to form higher order oligomeric structures (24Kilic F. Rudnick G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3106-3111Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The high molecular weight species could represent dimers and oligomers (Fig. 3A). The Cys replacement at positions 108 and 397 reduced the amount of the highly glycosylated forms of hSERT, which could provide one possible explanation for the loss of transport observed with these mutants (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3A). Surprisingly, Q332C was expressed at levels comparable with hSERT C109A (Fig. 3A). This glutamine is conserved among members of the Na+/Cl−-dependent family of transporters, suggesting its importance in transporter function. Replacement with a different residue could account for the loss of transport function observed. The remaining transporter mutants expressed amounts of the various forms of the protein comparable with C109A (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that loss of transporter function observed for Q332C, T497C, and G498C does not reflect disruption in the overall biosynthesis of the protein. Furthermore, radioligand binding experiments revealed that all mutant transporters were expressed on the cell surface at a level of 20–40% of total transporters (Fig. 3B). This finding would suggest that the marked reductions in transport activity observed for some mutants are not associated with defects in trafficking to the cell surface. To examine the reactivity of each Cys mutant to MTS reagents, SCAM studies were performed in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the C109A mutant or each Cys mutant cDNA. The aqueous accessibility and functional importance of the residues were assessed after incubating with 1 mm MTSET. This membrane-impermeant compound covalently modifies cysteine residues that are accessible to the aqueous environment of the protein. Disruption in transporter function by MTS reagents implicates the residue as being present in or near the substrate pore. The results were analyzed using normalized data for each mutant in order to examine MTS reactivity across different activity levels of the individual mutants. We observed significant (50–75%) MTSET-induced inactivation of transport at the I108C, A331C, Q332C, V397C, T497C, and G498C mutants (Fig. 4A). The decrease in [3H]5-HT uptake following treatment with MTSET suggested the presence of these residues in a hydrophilic environment of the protein that when modified disrupts transport activity. Potential electrostatic effects that could influence accessibility and reactivity associated with MTSET, which is positively charged, were ruled out by examining the sensitivity of each mutant to the neutral MTS compound PMTS. Reactivity of the mutants with PMTS paralleled the results obtained with MTSET with the exception that sensitivity of the V397C and G498C mutants did not reach significance for PMTS. In general, the results with PMTS alleviated concerns that electrostatic effects were impacting inactivation of the mutants by MTSET (Fig. 4B). The SCAM approach identified residues that are sensitive and accessible to MTS reagents. In order to understand better the proximity of these residues to critical sites for ligand binding, we examined the ability of different SERT substrates and antagonists to protect against reactivity with MTSET. HEK-293 cells expressing the Cys mutants were coincubated with MTSET in the presence or absence of a particular ligand, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The ability of a ligand to alter sensitivity was revealed by a change in [3H]5-HT uptake compared with the activity levels in the absence of ligand for each individual mutant. Among the mutants tested, TMH VI residues displayed the most marked changes in MTSET reactivity in the presence of 5-HT. Coincubation with unlabeled 5-HT fully protected Q332C from MTSET inactivation, possibly suggesting that the residue resides near a binding site for 5-HT and is altered conformationally upon 5-HT binding (Fig. 5A). We also tested the ability of MDMA and MPP+ to protect from MTSET inactivation, but neither affected reactivity with the reagent (Fig. 5, B and C). We extended our studies by testing the ability of cocaine to alter MTSET sensitivity. Coincubation with cocaine enhanced reactivity of Q332C to MTSET (Fig. 6A). Notably, cocaine and unlabeled 5-HT had opposite effects on the inactivation process at Q332C (Figs. 5A and 6A). One possibility is that cocaine binding induces a conformational change in the transporter, making Q332C more accessible to MTSET, thus enhancing transporter inactivation and inhibition of [3H]5-HT uptake. To characterize further the cocaine effect on MT"
