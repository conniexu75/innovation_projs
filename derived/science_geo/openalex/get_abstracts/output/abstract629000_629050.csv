https://openalex.org/W2919682265,"Atomically thin layers of two-dimensional materials can be assembled in vertical stacks that are held together by relatively weak van der Waals forces, enabling coupling between monolayer crystals with incommensurate lattices and arbitrary mutual rotation1,2. Consequently, an overarching periodicity emerges in the local atomic registry of the constituent crystal structures, which is known as a moiré superlattice3. In graphene/hexagonal boron nitride structures4, the presence of a moiré superlattice can lead to the observation of electronic minibands5–7, whereas in twisted graphene bilayers its effects are enhanced by interlayer resonant conditions, resulting in a superconductor–insulator transition at magic twist angles8. Here, using semiconducting heterostructures assembled from incommensurate molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) and tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayers, we demonstrate that excitonic bands can hybridize, resulting in a resonant enhancement of moiré superlattice effects. MoSe2 and WS2 were chosen for the near-degeneracy of their conduction-band edges, in order to promote the hybridization of intra- and interlayer excitons. Hybridization manifests through a pronounced exciton energy shift as a periodic function of the interlayer rotation angle, which occurs as hybridized excitons are formed by holes that reside in MoSe2 binding to a twist-dependent superposition of electron states in the adjacent monolayers. For heterostructures in which the monolayer pairs are nearly aligned, resonant mixing of the electron states leads to pronounced effects of the geometrical moiré pattern of the heterostructure on the dispersion and optical spectra of the hybridized excitons. Our findings underpin strategies for band-structure engineering in semiconductor devices based on van der Waals heterostructures9. Excitonic bands in MoSe2/WS2 heterostructures can hybridize, resulting in a resonant enhancement of moiré superlattice effects."
https://openalex.org/W2919692138,"Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) detects infections or tissue damage by binding to microbial or self DNA in the cytoplasm1. Upon binding DNA, cGAS produces cGAMP that binds to and activates the adaptor protein STING, which then activates the kinases IKK and TBK1 to induce interferons and other cytokines2-6. Here we report that STING also activates autophagy through a mechanism that is independent of TBK1 activation and interferon induction. Upon binding cGAMP, STING translocates to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the Golgi in a process that is dependent on the COP-II complex and ARF GTPases. STING-containing ERGIC serves as a membrane source for LC3 lipidation, which is a key step in autophagosome biogenesis. cGAMP induced LC3 lipidation through a pathway that is dependent on WIPI2 and ATG5 but independent of the ULK and VPS34-beclin kinase complexes. Furthermore, we show that cGAMP-induced autophagy is important for the clearance of DNA and viruses in the cytosol. Interestingly, STING from the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis induces autophagy but not interferons in response to stimulation by cGAMP, which suggests that induction of autophagy is a primordial function of the cGAS-STING pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2919704769,"The invasion of mammalian cytoplasm by microbial DNA from infectious pathogens or by self DNA from the nucleus or mitochondria represents a danger signal that alerts the host immune system1. Cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) is a sensor of cytoplasmic DNA that activates the type-I interferon pathway2. On binding to DNA, cGAS is activated to catalyse the synthesis of cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) from GTP and ATP3. cGAMP functions as a second messenger that binds to and activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING)3–9. STING then recruits and activates tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), which phosphorylates STING and the transcription factor IRF3 to induce type-I interferons and other cytokines10,11. However, how cGAMP-bound STING activates TBK1 and IRF3 is not understood. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human TBK1 in complex with cGAMP-bound, full-length chicken STING. The structure reveals that the C-terminal tail of STING adopts a β-strand-like conformation and inserts into a groove between the kinase domain of one TBK1 subunit and the scaffold and dimerization domain of the second subunit in the TBK1 dimer. In this binding mode, the phosphorylation site Ser366 in the STING tail cannot reach the kinase-domain active site of bound TBK1, which suggests that STING phosphorylation by TBK1 requires the oligomerization of both proteins. Mutational analyses validate the interaction mode between TBK1 and STING and support a model in which high-order oligomerization of STING and TBK1, induced by cGAMP, leads to STING phosphorylation by TBK1. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of human TBK1 in complex with cyclic GMP–AMP-bound chicken STING reveals a binding mode that suggests that STING phosphorylation by TBK1 requires oligomerization of both proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2919896467,"Infections by pathogens that contain DNA trigger the production of type-I interferons and inflammatory cytokines through cyclic GMP–AMP synthase, which produces 2′3′-cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) that binds to and activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING; also known as TMEM173, MITA, ERIS and MPYS)1–8. STING is an endoplasmic-reticulum membrane protein that contains four transmembrane helices followed by a cytoplasmic ligand-binding and signalling domain9–13. The cytoplasmic domain of STING forms a dimer, which undergoes a conformational change upon binding to cGAMP9,14. However, it remains unclear how this conformational change leads to STING activation. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length STING from human and chicken in the inactive dimeric state (about 80 kDa in size), as well as cGAMP-bound chicken STING in both the dimeric and tetrameric states. The structures show that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions interact to form an integrated, domain-swapped dimeric assembly. Closure of the ligand-binding domain, induced by cGAMP, leads to a 180° rotation of the ligand-binding domain relative to the transmembrane domain. This rotation is coupled to a conformational change in a loop on the side of the ligand-binding-domain dimer, which leads to the formation of the STING tetramer and higher-order oligomers through side-by-side packing. This model of STING oligomerization and activation is supported by our structure-based mutational analyses. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length STING show that cyclic GMP–AMP induces a half-turn rotation of the ligand-binding domain relative to the transmembrane domain, forming a tetramer and higher-order oligomers for signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2919822707,"Immune responses generally decline with age. However, the dynamics of this process at the individual level have not been characterized, hindering quantification of an individual's immune age. Here, we use multiple 'omics' technologies to capture population- and individual-level changes in the human immune system of 135 healthy adult individuals of different ages sampled longitudinally over a nine-year period. We observed high inter-individual variability in the rates of change of cellular frequencies that was dictated by their baseline values, allowing identification of steady-state levels toward which a cell subset converged and the ordered convergence of multiple cell subsets toward an older adult homeostasis. These data form a high-dimensional trajectory of immune aging (IMM-AGE) that describes a person's immune status better than chronological age. We show that the IMM-AGE score predicted all-cause mortality beyond well-established risk factors in the Framingham Heart Study, establishing its potential use in clinics for identification of patients at risk."
https://openalex.org/W2919508314,"The liver is the most common site of metastatic disease1. Although this metastatic tropism may reflect the mechanical trapping of circulating tumour cells, liver metastasis is also dependent, at least in part, on the formation of a 'pro-metastatic' niche that supports the spread of tumour cells to the liver2,3. The mechanisms that direct the formation of this niche are poorly understood. Here we show that hepatocytes coordinate myeloid cell accumulation and fibrosis within the liver and, in doing so, increase the susceptibility of the liver to metastatic seeding and outgrowth. During early pancreatic tumorigenesis in mice, hepatocytes show activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling and increased production of serum amyloid A1 and A2 (referred to collectively as SAA). Overexpression of SAA by hepatocytes also occurs in patients with pancreatic and colorectal cancers that have metastasized to the liver, and many patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease show increases in circulating SAA. Activation of STAT3 in hepatocytes and the subsequent production of SAA depend on the release of interleukin 6 (IL-6) into the circulation by non-malignant cells. Genetic ablation or blockade of components of IL-6-STAT3-SAA signalling prevents the establishment of a pro-metastatic niche and inhibits liver metastasis. Our data identify an intercellular network underpinned by hepatocytes that forms the basis of a pro-metastatic niche in the liver, and identify new therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2805441291,"Quantum scrambling is the dispersal of local information into many-body quantum entanglements and correlations distributed throughout an entire system. This concept accompanies the dynamics of thermalization in closed quantum systems, and has recently emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing chaos in black holes1-4. However, the direct experimental measurement of quantum scrambling is difficult, owing to the exponential complexity of ergodic many-body entangled states. One way to characterize quantum scrambling is to measure an out-of-time-ordered correlation function (OTOC); however, because scrambling leads to their decay, OTOCs do not generally discriminate between quantum scrambling and ordinary decoherence. Here we implement a quantum circuit that provides a positive test for the scrambling features of a given unitary process5,6. This approach conditionally teleports a quantum state through the circuit, providing an unambiguous test for whether scrambling has occurred, while simultaneously measuring an OTOC. We engineer quantum scrambling processes through a tunable three-qubit unitary operation as part of a seven-qubit circuit on an ion trap quantum computer. Measured teleportation fidelities are typically about 80 per cent, and enable us to experimentally bound the scrambling-induced decay of the corresponding OTOC measurement."
https://openalex.org/W2919859489,"Mitochondrial metabolism is an attractive target for cancer therapy1,2. Reprogramming metabolic pathways could improve the ability of metabolic inhibitors to suppress cancers with limited treatment options, such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)1,3. Here we show that BTB and CNC homology1 (BACH1)4, a haem-binding transcription factor that is increased in expression in tumours from patients with TNBC, targets mitochondrial metabolism. BACH1 decreases glucose utilization in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and negatively regulates transcription of electron transport chain (ETC) genes. BACH1 depletion by shRNA or degradation by hemin sensitizes cells to ETC inhibitors such as metformin5,6, suppressing growth of both cell line and patient-derived tumour xenografts. Expression of a haem-resistant BACH1 mutant in cells that express a short hairpin RNA for BACH1 rescues the BACH1 phenotype and restores metformin resistance in hemin-treated cells and tumours7. Finally, BACH1 gene expression inversely correlates with ETC gene expression in tumours from patients with breast cancer and in other tumour types, which highlights the clinical relevance of our findings. This study demonstrates that mitochondrial metabolism can be exploited by targeting BACH1 to sensitize breast cancer and potentially other tumour tissues to mitochondrial inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2920394342,"Cancer-specific inhibitors that reflect the unique metabolic needs of cancer cells are rare. Here we describe Gboxin, a small molecule that specifically inhibits the growth of primary mouse and human glioblastoma cells but not that of mouse embryonic fibroblasts or neonatal astrocytes. Gboxin rapidly and irreversibly compromises oxygen consumption in glioblastoma cells. Gboxin relies on its positive charge to associate with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes in a manner that is dependent on the proton gradient of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and it inhibits the activity of F0F1 ATP synthase. Gboxin-resistant cells require a functional mitochondrial permeability transition pore that regulates pH and thus impedes the accumulation of Gboxin in the mitochondrial matrix. Administration of a metabolically stable Gboxin analogue inhibits glioblastoma allografts and patient-derived xenografts. Gboxin toxicity extends to established human cancer cell lines of diverse organ origin, and shows that the increased proton gradient and pH in cancer cell mitochondria is a mode of action that can be targeted in the development of antitumour reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2904188220,"Over the past decade, the ability to reduce the dimensions of fluidic devices to the nanometre scale (by using nanotubes1-5 or nanopores6-11, for example) has led to the discovery of unexpected water- and ion-transport phenomena12-14. More recently, van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional materials15 has allowed the creation of artificial channels with ångström-scale precision16. Such channels push fluid confinement to the molecular scale, wherein the limits of continuum transport equations17 are challenged. Water films on this scale can rearrange into one or two layers with strongly suppressed dielectric permittivity18,19 or form a room-temperature ice phase20. Ionic motion in such confined channels21 is affected by direct interactions between the channel walls and the hydration shells of the ions, and water transport becomes strongly dependent on the channel wall material22. We explore how water and ionic transport are coupled in such confinement. Here we report measurements of ionic fluid transport through molecular-sized slit-like channels. The transport, driven by pressure and by an applied electric field, reveals a transistor-like electrohydrodynamic effect. An applied bias of a fraction of a volt increases the measured pressure-driven ionic transport (characterized by streaming mobilities) by up to 20 times. This gating effect is observed in both graphite and hexagonal boron nitride channels but exhibits marked material-dependent differences. We use a modified continuum framework accounting for the material-dependent frictional interaction of water molecules, ions and the confining surfaces to explain the differences observed between channels made of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. This highly nonlinear gating of fluid transport under molecular-scale confinement may offer new routes to control molecular and ion transport, and to explore electromechanical couplings that may have a role in recently discovered mechanosensitive ionic channels23."
https://openalex.org/W2919574227,"The computations performed by local neural populations, such as a cortical layer, are typically inferred from anatomical connectivity and observations of neural activity. Here we describe a method—influence mapping—that uses single-neuron perturbations to directly measure how cortical neurons reshape sensory representations. In layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1), we use two-photon optogenetics to trigger action potentials in a targeted neuron and calcium imaging to measure the effect on spiking in neighbouring neurons in awake mice viewing visual stimuli. Excitatory neurons on average suppressed other neurons and had a centre–surround influence profile over anatomical space. A neuron’s influence on its neighbour depended on their similarity in activity. Notably, neurons suppressed activity in similarly tuned neurons more than in dissimilarly tuned neurons. In addition, photostimulation reduced the population response, specifically to the targeted neuron’s preferred stimulus, by around 2%. Therefore, V1 layer 2/3 performed feature competition, in which a like-suppresses-like motif reduces redundancy in population activity and may assist with inference of the features that underlie sensory input. We anticipate that influence mapping can be extended to investigate computations in other neural populations. A combination of optogenetics and calcium imaging at the single-neuron level provides evidence for feature-specific competition among neurons in primary visual cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2919113889,"Cells often use multiple pathways to repair the same DNA lesion, and the choice of pathway has substantial implications for the fidelity of genome maintenance. DNA interstrand crosslinks covalently link the two strands of DNA, and thereby block replication and transcription; the cytotoxicity of these crosslinks is exploited for chemotherapy. In Xenopus egg extracts, the collision of replication forks with interstrand crosslinks initiates two distinct repair pathways. NEIL3 glycosylase can cleave the crosslink1; however, if this fails, Fanconi anaemia proteins incise the phosphodiester backbone that surrounds the interstrand crosslink, generating a double-strand-break intermediate that is repaired by homologous recombination2. It is not known how the simpler NEIL3 pathway is prioritized over the Fanconi anaemia pathway, which can cause genomic rearrangements. Here we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP is required for both pathways. When two replisomes converge at an interstrand crosslink, TRAIP ubiquitylates the replicative DNA helicase CMG (the complex of CDC45, MCM2–7 and GINS). Short ubiquitin chains recruit NEIL3 through direct binding, whereas longer chains are required for the unloading of CMG by the p97 ATPase, which enables the Fanconi anaemia pathway. Thus, TRAIP controls the choice between the two known pathways of replication-coupled interstrand-crosslink repair. These results, together with our other recent findings3,4 establish TRAIP as a master regulator of CMG unloading and the response of the replisome to obstacles. The E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAIP governs the choice between the NEIL3 or the Fanconi anaemia pathway for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks."

https://openalex.org/W2920335126,"The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) can aid in the translation of integrative neuroscience. We argue that the RDoC framework, with its emphasis on integration across units of analysis, leveraged with computational approaches, can organize intermediary treatment targets and clinical outcomes, augmenting the translational stream. The NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) can aid in the translation of integrative neuroscience. We argue that the RDoC framework, with its emphasis on integration across units of analysis, leveraged with computational approaches, can organize intermediary treatment targets and clinical outcomes, augmenting the translational stream. Improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders have not kept pace with advances in integrative neuroscience, and one limiting factor is that treatment targets—clinical syndromes and disorders—have been defined by patient reports and clinical observations and not by neural and psychological mechanisms (Hyman, 2010Hyman S.E. The diagnosis of mental disorders: the problem of reification.Annu. Rev. Clin. Psychol. 2010; 6: 155-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). For these reasons, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) launched the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative in 2009. The strategic purpose was to facilitate novel research approaches to understanding the disturbances of nervous system structure and function and their behavioral manifestations that constitute psychiatric symptoms. RDoC filled a gap by providing a conceptual structure to organize and communicate our understanding of fundamental behavioral-neural systems (e.g., fear or working memory). RDoC allows researchers to specify independent and dependent variables to investigate the mechanisms of mental illness. Ultimately, this will allow a transformation of the translational process so that treatment targets are more precisely linked to dysfunctional internal mechanisms relevant to clinical manifestations. The RDoC approach has roots in experimental psychopathology, where neural, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms for normal processes were identified, and failures in these systems were markers for clinical problems (e.g., Maher, 1966Maher B. Principles of Psychopathology: An Experimental Approach. McGraw-Hill, 1966Google Scholar). In contrast, today’s translational research relies heavily on broad, heterogeneous clinical syndromes as defined by diagnostic manuals. Characterizing clinical problems differently and more precisely would better allow translational researchers to incorporate increasing knowledge from integrative neuroscience. Specifically, classifying mental illness with more proximate intermediary linkages that connect clinical symptoms and neural substrates would better advance research efforts. This requires re-thinking of research design as well as changes to regulations for the outcome variables employed in the final stages of clinical translation. RDoC allows a way to do this by providing researchers an alternative to traditional diagnostic categories. It is explicitly agnostic with respect to syndromal definitions of disorders provided by clinical diagnostic manuals. RDoC is premised on clarifying how disruptions in normative internal mechanisms relate to the expression of clinical symptoms in order to pinpoint more precisely treatment targets than approaches that begin with observed clinical syndromes. A central goal is to develop a scientific basis for future neuroscience-informed diagnostic systems that will facilitate more precise treatment targets by integrating relevant neural circuits. Through this process, RDoC will enhance the translational stream. The crux of the RDoC initiative is a matrix, consisting of domains that group functional constructs (e.g., reward learning, cognitive control) across the rows and units of analysis (e.g., circuit measures, behavioral task data) down the columns (Figure 1). The resultant cells of the matrix are thus occupied by elements that have demonstrated utility in assessing a given construct at a given unit of analysis (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex and dorsal striatum activity and reward-related behavior for measuring reward learning) across the full range from normal to abnormal functioning. The matrix is an evolving structure to specify fundamental mental processes that can be measured across biological and behavioral units (the latter comprising both overt behavior and phenomenological self-reports). It provides a framework to organize research efforts that frees researchers from constraints imposed by categorical clinical syndromes, the latter of which are problematic because they are over-specified, heterogeneous, and overlapping (Cuthbert and Insel, 2013Cuthbert B.N. Insel T.R. Toward the future of psychiatric diagnosis: the seven pillars of RDoC.BMC Med. 2013; 11: 126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). The domains and subsidiary constructs in the matrix were chosen to best capture the current knowledgebase and are amended as scientific evidence accumulates. Because RDoC was developed at NIMH as a resource for researchers, the National Advisory Mental Health Council (NAMHC) provides oversight for changes. The NAMHC has convened a workgroup to address the ongoing “Changes to the RDoC Matrix” (CMAT). The CMAT workgroup is encouraged—and provided resources—to seek consultation from leading experts in areas where questions about change arise. Like the summaries of the process and rationale for the development of the RDoC domains, documents detailing each major change to the matrix are available on the RDoC website, and older versions of the matrix are archived on the matrix website. The CMAT workgroup handles changes both large (e.g., considering addition a new domain) and small (e.g., changing elements in the individual cells). An example of a matrix revision based on the accumulation of scientific knowledge is a series of refinements that were made to the Positive Valence Systems (PVS) domain. The goals of the reorganization of this domain were to make the constructs more straightforward and less redundant and to align more closely with recent data stemming from such areas as reinforcement learning, reward prediction errors, and response to reward. Originally, the PVS domain included five constructs, one of which (approach motivation) had four subconstructs. The revised domain has three constructs, which span reward responsiveness, reward learning, and reward valuation, and each includes three sub-constructs. Revisions may also be based on the need for better specification. An example of this kind of change involved the evaluation of tasks and measures for quantifying RDoC constructs and explicating standards and ideals for reliability and validity of tasks and measures used in RDoC research studies. The rationale for changes can also be based on the realization that there is a gap where relevant mechanisms are not adequately captured. An example here is the Sensorimotor Domain, which was recently added because of observations made by investigators that motor system disruptions are present in a number of clinical syndromes (e.g., neurodevelopmental and psychosis spectrum disorders). Computational neuroscience offers promising ways for advances using data-driven, integrative approaches. Existing psychiatric research typically focuses on a single mode of action, often with a linear causal model. However, in light of the abundance of biological mechanisms involved in mental illness and the heterogeneous nature of the phenomenology characterizing psychiatric syndromes, it is not surprising that unimodal studies have yet to provide a clear understanding of connections among biological mechanisms and clinical presentation. Several factors have hampered the development of valid psychiatric biomarkers, including that relevant mechanisms (1) are distributed across distinct bio-behavioral continua; (2) unfold across different spatiotemporal dimensions of neural circuits and development; and (3) involve causal dynamics where multiple causes can lead to a similar outcome or similar causal pathways can lead to different outcomes. Recent studies that are aimed at integrating pathophysiological dimensions among patients with varied presentation at the clinical syndrome level but characterized by one or more biological mechanisms provide complementary information to elaborate the complex pathways of promising biomarkers. This approach has been described as “deep phenotyping,” where pathological processes are comprehensively detailed (Robinson, 2012Robinson P.N. Deep phenotyping for precision medicine.Hum. Mutat. 2012; 33: 777-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The units of analysis in the RDoC framework provide a structure to explicate and organize these details. At the same time, computational strategies offer a possibility to seamlessly specify multimodal data streams in order to improve validity of psychiatric diagnosis and enrich the translational stream. In other words, computational strategies offer a way to specify the relations of RDoC elements. Using computational models to integrate pathological processes that span multiple units of analysis in the RDoC matrix has the potential to improve the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of diagnostic tools. Computational models can also incorporate different stages of illness, including early asymptomatic at-risk periods, prodromal phases where symptoms may be attenuated, full-fledged symptomatic periods, and end stages. These models can also incorporate dimensions such as, for example, normal to severe cognitive impairment. Developmental processes and dimensional approaches are fundamental principles of RDoC, and the comprehensive nature of combining these approaches could identify pathognomonic markers of mental illness that occur during neurodevelopment well before the manifestation of frank disorder. This, in turn, would allow for the discovery of more optimal timing for interventions as well as new targets for treatment based on such neurodevelopmental markers. Combining multiple imaging and behavioral measures could provide missing links to understand complex mental illnesses leading to improved diagnostic or treatment assignment performance compared to using unimodal biomarkers. For instance, batteries of mental-health-relevant behavioral tasks that evaluate specific domains of function could be parametrically detailed into components that could then be linked to measures of neural processes to specify the relation of brain and behavioral parameters. Or, diagnostic scales could be developed based on brain changes using structural imaging or alterations in connectivity using resting-state or task-based functional imaging. These parameters would serve network analyses to develop models of aberrant mechanisms in patient populations. Neurophysiological imaging could be used to quantify variations in metabolism and integrated polygenic risk scores as well as temporal dynamics of peripheral measures such as molecular markers. Analysis techniques such as matrix and tensor decompositions hold promise to better account for the heterogeneity of mechanisms that vary within and across patients over time. NIMH has recognized the potential for computational psychiatry approaches to develop novel data-driven solutions (Ferrante et al., 2018Ferrante M. Redish A.D. Oquendo M.A. Averbeck B.B. Kinnane M.E. Gordon J.A. Computational psychiatry: a report from the 2017 NIMH workshop on opportunities and challenges.Mol. Psychiatry. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-018-0063-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Research informed by RDoC principles can advance explanations of disturbances in effect and behavior by facilitating the study of different granular components that have not been incorporated into syndromal specifications of mental illness. This offers the prospect of utilizing RDoC concepts to further treatment development efforts by offering a wider range of treatment targets and outcomes. In regard to outcomes, the present models for efficacy studies embraced by regulatory bodies base indications for psychotropic medications or neurostimulation techniques on standard categorical diagnoses. That is, a given medication would be evaluated for approval for use in the treatment of one or more mental disorders as defined by the relevant diagnostic manual. Mechanisms revealed with RDoC-framed research introduce a wider range of potential targets and outcomes. For instance, by allowing the study of components that may apply to one or more clinical syndromes, RDoC research might reveal a target that more directly connects to an aberrant mechanism. Even if intervening on that mechanism would not remit a syndromal diagnosis, this precision medicine approach could ameliorate a specific pathological mechanism and bring clinically significant relief. RDoC specification of disturbances in brain circuitry in the context of other RDoC units of analysis that are associated with mental illnesses offers the prospect of addressing specific symptoms that have been demonstrated to cut across diagnostic lines. Progress in this area has been hampered not only because of reliance on diagnostic categories as indications for prescription drugs (Pankevich et al., 2014Pankevich D.E. Altevogt B.M. Dunlop J. Gage F.H. Hyman S.E. Improving and accelerating drug development for nervous system disorders.Neuron. 2014; 84: 546-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) but to an understandable concern about pseudospecificity, whereby improvement in one aspect of a disorder might not reflect a precisely delineated treatment response by one particular component of a disorder. Rather, if the clinical syndrome is believed to be a unitary entity, then there follows a potentially errant assumption that all signs and symptoms would benefit commensurately from successful treatment. For example, a depressive episode is composed of a number of symptoms, each of which may be imperfect for the diagnosis. Consider among the symptoms of poor sleep, increased or decreased appetite, decreased libido, and impaired concentration, all of which could be part-and-parcel of the clinical syndrome. The neurological mechanisms for these problems are not unitary and involve complex biological and psychological intermediary processes. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that the symptoms of the diagnostic category would improve at varying rates and in different ways in the remission process. There are examples of research that has moved beyond the pseudospecificity of the schizophrenia diagnosis. For instance, the International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT) found that individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and at elevated risk for suicide who were treated with the atypical antipsychotic clozapine had a 24% lower risk of suicide attempt or hospitalization to prevent suicide compared with olanzapine-treated patients during a 2-year follow-up (Meltzer et al., 2003Meltzer H.Y. Alphs L. Green A.I. Altamura A.C. Anand R. Bertoldi A. Bourgeois M. Chouinard G. Islam M.Z. Kane J. et al.International Suicide Prevention Trial Study GroupClozapine treatment for suicidality in schizophrenia: International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT).Arch. Gen. Psychiatry. 2003; 60: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). This result was striking, given that psychosis symptom severity was equivalent across the two treatment groups, indicating that the reduction in suicidality was independent of changes in psychosis. Although it remains unclear whether clozapine targets a distinct mechanism specifically related to suicide risk, subsequent FDA approval of labeling of the drug as indicated for “reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior” set a regulatory precedent for approving the use of a drug to treat a specific component of a disorder rather than remission from the lumped symptoms of a syndrome that is assumed to be unitary. Cognitive dysfunction, evident across the schizophrenia spectrum and affective spectrum disorders, has also been investigated as an entity apart from a specific clinical syndrome (Buchanan et al., 2011Buchanan R.W. Keefe R.S. Umbricht D. Green M.F. Laughren T. Marder S.R. The FDA-NIMH-MATRICS guidelines for clinical trial design of cognitive-enhancing drugs: what do we know 5 years later?.Schizophr. Bull. 2011; 37: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although some differences in the features of cognitive disturbances in psychotic versus affective conditions have been observed, research on cognitive dysfunction across diagnostic categories illustrates a transdiagnostic approach consistent with RDoC by suggesting outcome variables other than remission for efficacy studies. This opens the door for development and evaluation of pro-cognitive drugs as well as for behavioral interventions for cognitive remediation. If psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairments are mediated by independent brain circuits, then different targets would be indicated for two comorbid mechanisms. RDoC provides the research framework to systematically study this possibility. In the area of affective disorders, one of the newest antidepressant medications, vortioxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with multiple actions at several serotonin receptors, demonstrates a multi-domain beneficial effect on cognitive performance, evidenced by improvements in measures of executive function, attention and speed of processing, and memory (Harrison et al., 2016Harrison J.E. Lophaven S. Olsen C.K. Which cognitive domains are improved by treatment with vortioxetine?.Int. J. Neuropsychopharmacol. 2016; 19: pyw054Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These cognitive effects have surpassed those evidenced by other antidepressant medications and have been shown in short-term controlled trials to result primarily from a direct treatment effect on cognitive function rather than attributable to a secondary effect of the alleviation of depressed mood (Mahableshwarkar et al., 2015Mahableshwarkar A.R. Zajecka J. Jacobson W. Chen Y. Keefe R.S. A randomized, placebo-controlled, active-reference, double-blind, flexible-dose study of the efficacy of vortioxetine on cognitive function in major depressive disorder.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2015; 40: 2025-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In response, regulatory agencies, first in Europe and then in the United States, have approved additional labeling language describing the two major industry-sponsored cognitive function studies but have proceeded cautiously without expanded indications for prescribers. The RDoC initiative was introduced to unbridle researchers from constraints imposed by using clinical syndromes for translational research and invites novel approaches to research conceptualizations and classifications of psychopathology to build new translational pathways. This approach, as well as the transdiagnostic and intermediate phenotype approaches, offers potential to enhance the translational stream. The RDoC matrix offers the additional advantage of a common schematic to organize, communicate, and relate research findings. Biophysically informed theory-driven models that encompass multiple biological and behavioral dimensions to test mechanistic hypotheses can draw on findings from RDoC research by incorporating elements from the RDoC matrix, and the relations among the elements in the RDoC matrix could be explicated with computational approaches. Progress thus far has set the stage for RDoC to be implemented in intervention development."
https://openalex.org/W2920881718,"Alginate is considered an exceptional biomaterial due to its hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, biodegradability, nontoxicity and low-cost in comparison with other biopolymers. We have recently demonstrated that the incorporation of 1% graphene oxide (GO) into alginate films crosslinked with Ca2+ cations provides antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, and no cytotoxicity for human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. However, many other reports in literature have shown controversial results about the toxicity of GO demanding further investigation. Furthermore, the synergic effect of GO with other divalent cations with intrinsic antibacterial and cytotoxic activity such as Zn2+ has not been explored yet. Thus, here, two commercially available sodium alginates were characterised and utilized in the synthesis of zinc alginate films with GO following the same chemical route reported for the calcium alginate/GO composites. The results of this study showed that zinc release, water sorption/diffusion and wettability depended significantly on the type of alginate utilized. Furthermore, Zn2+ and GO produced alginate films with increased water diffusion, wettability and opacity. However, neither the combination of GO with Zn2+ nor the use of different types of sodium alginates modified the antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of the zinc alginates against these Gram-positive pathogens and human cells respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2918188897,"Germinal centres are important sites for antibody diversification and affinity maturation, and are also a common origin of B cell malignancies. Despite being made up of motile cells, germinal centres are tightly confined within B cell follicles. The cues that promote this confinement are incompletely understood. P2RY8 is a Gα13-coupled receptor that mediates the inhibition of migration and regulates the growth of B cells in lymphoid tissues1,2. P2RY8 is frequently mutated in germinal-centre B cell-like diffuse large B cell lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma1,3-6, and the ligand for this receptor has not yet been identified. Here we perform a search for P2RY8 ligands and find P2RY8 bioactivity in bile and in culture supernatants of several mouse and human cell lines. Using a seven-step biochemical fractionation procedure and a drop-out mass spectrometry approach, we show that a previously undescribed biomolecule, S-geranylgeranyl-L-glutathione (GGG), is a potent P2RY8 ligand that is detectable in lymphoid tissues at the nanomolar level. GGG inhibited the chemokine-mediated migration of human germinal-centre B cells and T follicular helper cells, and antagonized the induction of phosphorylated AKT in germinal-centre B cells. We also found that the enzyme gamma-glutamyltransferase-5 (GGT5), which was highly expressed by follicular dendritic cells, metabolized GGG to a form that did not activate the receptor. Overexpression of GGT5 disrupted the ability of P2RY8 to promote B cell confinement to germinal centres, which indicates that GGT5 establishes a GGG gradient in lymphoid tissues. This work defines GGG as an intercellular signalling molecule that is involved in organizing and controlling germinal-centre responses. As the P2RY8 locus is modified in several other types of cancer in addition to GCB-DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma, we speculate that GGG might have organizing and growth-regulatory roles in multiple human tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2921316058,"Dietary methionine restriction (MR) is well known to reduce body weight by increasing energy expenditure (EE) and insulin sensitivity. An elevated concentration of circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has been implicated as a potential underlying mechanism. The aims of our study were to test whether dietary MR in the context of a high-fat regimen protects against type 2 diabetes in mice and to investigate whether vegan and vegetarian diets, which have naturally low methionine levels, modulate circulating FGF21 in humans. New Zealand obese (NZO) mice, a model for polygenic obesity and type 2 diabetes, were placed on isocaloric high-fat diets (protein, 16 kcal%; carbohydrate, 52 kcal%; fat, 32 kcal%) that provided methionine at control (Con; 0.86% methionine) or low levels (0.17%) for 9 wk. Markers of glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity were analyzed. Among humans, low methionine intake and circulating FGF21 levels were investigated by comparing a vegan and a vegetarian diet to an omnivore diet and evaluating the effect of a short-term vegetarian diet on FGF21 induction. In comparison with the Con group, MR led to elevated plasma FGF21 levels and prevented the onset of hyperglycemia in NZO mice. MR-fed mice exhibited increased insulin sensitivity, higher plasma adiponectin levels, increased EE, and up-regulated expression of thermogenic genes in subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Food intake and fat mass did not change. Plasma FGF21 levels were markedly higher in vegan humans compared with omnivores, and circulating FGF21 levels increased significantly in omnivores after 4 d on a vegetarian diet These data suggest that MR induces FGF21 and protects NZO mice from high-fat diet-induced glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes. The normoglycemic phenotype in vegans and vegetarians may be caused by induced FGF21. MR akin to vegan and vegetarian diets in humans may offer metabolic benefits via increased circulating levels of FGF21 and merits further investigation.—Castaño-Maitinez, T., Schumacher, F., Schumacher, S., Kochlik, B., Weber, D., Grune, T., Biemann, R., McCann, A., Abraham, K., Weikert, C., Kleuser, B., Schürmann, A., Laeger, T.

https://openalex.org/W2920894195,"Specialized proresolving mediators (SPMs) biosynthesized from docosahexaenoic acids (DHAs) including resolvins (Rvs), protectins, and maresins are potent endogenous autacoids that actively resolve inflammation, protect organs, and stimulate tissue regeneration. Our hypothesis was that failure of resolution programs may lead to unremitting inflammation in obesity, contributing to the development of metabolic comorbidities in this condition. Obese individuals with persistent low-grade systemic inflammation showed reduced leukocyte production of the DHA-derived monohydroxy fatty acid 17—hydroxy-DHA (HDHA) and unbalanced formation of SPMs (in particular d-series Rvs) accompanied by enhanced production of proinflammatory lipid mediators such as leukotriene B4. Mechanistic studies attributed this impairment to reduced 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) activity rather than altered DHA cellular uptake. Moreover, leukocytes from obese individuals exhibited decreased 5-LOX levels and reduced 5-LOX Ser271 phosphorylation and distinct intracellular 5-LOX redistribution. However, 15-LOX appears to be the most critical factor for the deficient production of SPMs by obese leukocytes because the formation of d-series Rvs was completely rescued by incubation with the intermediate precursor 17-HDHA. These data provide proof of concept that administration of intermediate precursors of SPM biosynthesis (e.g., 17-HDHA) could be more efficient in overriding impaired formation of these proresolving lipid mediators in conditions characterized by dysfunctional LOX activity, such as obesity.—López-Vicario, C, Titos, E., Walker, M.

https://openalex.org/W2921362401,"Classical DNA and RNA polymerase (pol) enzymes have defined roles with their respective substrates, but several pols have been found to have multiple functions. We reported previously that purified human DNA pol η (hpol η) can incorporate both deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs) and can use both DNA and RNA as substrates. X-ray crystal structures revealed that two pol η residues, Phe-18 and Tyr-92, behave as steric gates to influence sugar selectivity. However, the physiological relevance of these phenomena has not been established. Here, we show that purified hpol η adds rNTPs to DNA primers at physiological rNTP concentrations and in the presence of competing dNTPs. When two rATPs were inserted opposite a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, the substrate was less efficiently cleaved by human RNase H2. Human XP-V fibroblast extracts, devoid of hpol η, could not add rNTPs to a DNA primer, but the expression of transfected hpol η in the cells restored this ability. XP-V cell extracts did not add dNTPs to DNA primers hybridized to RNA, but could when hpol η was expressed in the cells. HEK293T cell extracts could add dNTPs to DNA primers hybridized to RNA, but lost this ability if hpol η was deleted. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon was not observed when other translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases—hpol ι, κ, or ζ—were individually deleted. These results suggest that hpol η is one of the major reverse transcriptases involved in physiological processes in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2922389716,"Sirtuins (SIRTs) are NAD+-dependent deacylases that play a key role in transcription, DNA repair, metabolism, and oxidative stress resistance. Increasing NAD+ availability regulates endogenous SIRT activity, leading to increased resistance to oxidative stress and decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen production in multiple cell types and disease models. This protection, at least in part, depends on the activation of antioxidant mitochondrial proteins. We now show that increasing total NAD+ content in astrocytes leads to the activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2, like 2 (Nfe212 or Nrf2) and up-regulation of the antioxidant proteins heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and sulfiredoxin 1 (SRXN1). Nrf2 activation also occurs as a result of SIRT6 overexpression. Mutations in Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) cause familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Astrocytes isolated from mutant human SOD1-overexpressing mice induce motor neuron death in coculture. Treatment with nicotinamide mononucleotide or nicotinamide riboside increases total NAD+ content in ALS astrocytes and abrogates their toxicity toward cocultured motor neurons. The observed neuroprotection depends on SIRT6 expression in astrocytes. Moreover, overexpression of SIRT6 in astrocytes by itself abrogates the neurotoxic phenotype of ALS astrocytes. Our results identify SIRT6 as a potential therapeutic target to prevent astrocyte-mediated motor neuron death in ALS.—Harlan, B. A., Pehar, M., Killoy, K. M., Vargas, M. R.

https://openalex.org/W2921099264,"Sclerostin exerts profound local control over bone acquisition and also mediates endocrine communication between fat and bone. In bone, sclerostin's anti-osteoanabolic activity is enhanced by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (Lrp4), which facilitates its interaction with the Lrp5 and Lrp6 Wnt co-receptors. To determine whether Lrp4 similarly affects sclerostin's endocrine function, we examined body composition as well as glucose and fatty acid metabolism in mice rendered deficient of Lrp4 in the adipocyte (AdΔLrp4) or the osteoblast (ObΔLrp4). AdΔLrp4 mice exhibit a reduction in adipocyte hypertrophy and improved glucose and lipid homeostasis, marked by increased glucose and insulin tolerance and reduced serum fatty acids, and mirror the effect of sclerostin deficiency on whole-body metabolism. Indeed, epistasis studies place adipocyte-expressed Lrp4 and sclerostin in the same genetic cascade that regulates adipocyte function. Intriguingly, ObΔLrp4 mice, which exhibit dramatic increases in serum sclerostin, accumulate body fat and develop impairments in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity despite development of a high bone mass phenotype. These data indicate that expression of Lrp4 by both the adipocyte and osteoblast is required for normal sclerostin endocrine function and that the impact of sclerostin deficiency on adipocyte physiology is distinct from the effect on osteoblast function."
https://openalex.org/W2920937108,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process implicated in the initial stage of cancer metastasis, which is the major cause of tumor recurrence and mortality. Although key transcription factors that regulate EMT, such as snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2), are well characterized, the upstream signaling pathways controlling these transcriptional mediators are largely unknown, which limits therapeutic strategies. Sphingosine 1–phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive lipid mediator, generated by sphingosine kinases (SPHK1 and SPHK2), that mainly exerts its effects by binding to the following 5 GPCRs: S1P1 to S1P5. S1P signaling has been reported to regulate different aspects of cancer progression including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration; nevertheless, its role in cancer metastasis, specifically via EMT, is not established. Here we show that SPHK1 expression correlates significantly with EMT score in breast cancer cell lines, and with SNAI2 in patient-derived breast tumors. Cell-based assays demonstrate that S1P can rapidly up-regulate the expression of SNAI2 in breast cancer cells via the activation of cognate receptors S1P2 and S1P3. Knockdown studies suggest that S1P2 and S1P3 mediate this effect by activating myocardin-related transcription factor A (MRTF-A) and yes-associated protein (YAP), respectively. Michigan Cancer Foundation 7 cells stably overexpressing S1P2 or S1P3 exhibit a more invasive phenotype, when compared to control cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that S1P produced by SPHK1 induces SNAI2 expression via S1P2-YAP and S1P3-MRTF-A pathways, leading to enhanced cell invasion. Cumulatively, this study reveals a novel mechanism by which S1P activates parallel pathways that regulate the expression of SNAI2, a master regulator of EMT, and provides new insights into druggable therapeutic targets that may limit cancer metastasis.

We investigated the performance of a commercially available RDT, which simultaneously detects the non-structural 1 (NS1) dengue virus (DENV) antigen, and IgM and IgG DENV antibodies, using representative serum samples from individuals in a dengue endemic area in Salvador, Brazil.We evaluated the accuracy of the SD BIOLINE Dengue Duo RDT (Abbott, Santa Clara, USA; former Alere Inc, Waltham, USA) in a random collection of sera. Samples included acute-phase sera from 246 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases and 108 non-dengue febrile patients enrolled in a surveillance study for dengue detection, 73 healthy controls living in the same surveillance community, and 73 blood donors. RDT accuracy was blindly assessed based on the combined results for the NS1 and the IgM test components. The RDT sensitivity was 46.8% (38.6% for the NS1 component and 13.8% for the IgM component). Sensitivity was greater for samples obtained from patients with secondary DENV infections (49.8%) compared to primary infections (31.1%) (P: 0.02) and was also influenced by the result in the confirmatory dengue diagnostic test, ranging from 39.7% for samples of cases confirmed by IgM-ELISA seroconversion between paired samples to 90.4% for samples of cases confirmed by a positive NS1-ELISA. The RDT specificity was 94.4% for non-dengue febrile patients, 87.7% for the community healthy controls, and 95.9% for the blood donors.The SD BIOLINE Dengue Duo RDT showed good specificities, but low sensitivity, suggesting that it may be more useful to rule in than to rule out a dengue diagnosis in dengue endemic regions."
https://openalex.org/W2922443154,"Plasticity of epithelial cell-cell adhesion is vital in epithelial homeostasis and is regulated in multiple processes associated with cell migration, such as embryogenesis and wound healing. In cancer, cell-cell adhesion is compromised and is associated with increased cell migration and metastasis. Aquaporin (AQP) water channels facilitate water transport across cell membranes and are essential in the regulation of body water homeostasis. Increased expression of several AQPs, especially AQP5, is associated with increased cancer cell migration, metastasis, and poor prognosis. We found that AQP5 overexpression in normal epithelial cells induced cell detachment and dissemination from migrating cell sheets. AQP5 reduced both cell-cell coordination during collective migration and overall distance covered by the migrating cell sheets. AQP5 and the isoforms AQP1 and AQP4 decreased, whereas AQP3 increased, levels of plasma membrane-associated lateral junctional proteins. This regulation was mediated by the cytoplasmic domains of the AQPs. This shows that the AQPs have dual functions in epithelial physiology: as channel proteins and as differential regulators of cell-cell adhesiveness. This regulation may contribute to dynamic regulation of cell junctions in processes such as embryogenesis and wound healing and also explain the pivotal roles of AQPs in carcinogenesis and metastasis.—Login, F.

https://openalex.org/W2950186886,"Fish are ideally suited for in vivo-imaging due to their transparency at early stages combined with a large genetic toolbox. Key challenges to further advance imaging are fluorophore selection, immobilization of the specimen and approaches to eliminate pigmentation. We addressed all three and identified the fluorophores and anaesthesia of choice by high throughput time-lapse imaging. Our results indicate that eGFP and mCherry are the best conservative choices for in vivo-fluorescence experiments, when availability of well-established antibodies and nanobodies matters. Still, mVenusNB and mGFPmut2 delivered highest absolute fluorescence intensities in vivo. Immobilization is of key importance during extended in vivo imaging. Here, traditional approaches are outperformed by mRNA injection of α-Bungarotoxin which allows a complete and reversible, transient immobilization. In combination with fully transparent juvenile and adult fish established by the targeted inactivation of both, oca2 and pnp4a via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in medaka we could dramatically improve the state-of-the art imaging conditions in post-embryonic fish, now enabling light-sheet microscopy of the growing retina, brain, gills and inner organs in the absence of side effects caused by anaesthetic drugs or pigmentation."

Use was determined as ≥ 1 prescription filled during pregnancies that resulted in births (livebirth/stillbirth) and abortions. Rates were calculated at any time during pregnancy and after a pregnancy-related visit. Rates were additionally characterized by risk in pregnancy using Briggs classification (2017). Of 174,848 birth pregnancies, overall 64.9% filled ≥ 1 prescription during pregnancy (a significant increase from 62.3% to 68.8% from 2001-2013, p<0.0001); 55.4% filled ≥ 1 prescription after a pregnancy-related visit.

https://openalex.org/W2920993296,"An unusual decline and collapse of young established trees known as “rapid apple decline” (RAD) has become a major concern for apple growers, particularly in the northeastern United States. This decline is characterized by stunted growth, pale yellow to reddish leaves, and tree collapse within weeks after onset of symptoms. We studied declining apple trees to identify potential involvement of abiotic and biotic stresses. We used 16S and ITS to profile bacterial and fungal communities in the soil, rhizosphere, roots, and shoots and tested for the presence of six viruses in scions and rootstocks of symptomatic and asymptomatic trees. The viruses detected were not associated with RAD symptoms. Bacterial and fungal populations were highly variable in plant tissue, soil and rhizosphere samples, with bacteroidetes, firmicutes, proteobacteria, acidobacteria, and actinobacteria the predominant bacterial classes in various samples. ‘Alphaproteobacteria-rickettsiales’, a bacterial class usually reduced in water-limiting soils, had significantly low abundance in root samples of symptomatic trees. Basidiomycota and Ascomycota fungal classes were the most common fungal classes observed, but neither showed differential enrichment between symptomatic and asymptomatic trees. Analyzing weather data showed an extremely cold winter followed by drought in 2015–2016, which likely weakened the trees to make them more susceptible to varied stresses. In addition, similar physical and nutritional soil composition from symptomatic and asymptomatic trees rules out the role of nutritional stress in RAD. Necrotic lesions and wood decay symptoms dispersing from bark or vascular cambium towards the heartwood were observed primarily below the graft union of declining apple trees, suggesting that the rootstock is the originating point of RAD. We speculate that differences in abiotic factors such as moisture levels in declining roots in combination with extreme weather profiles might cause RAD but cannot clearly rule out the involvement of other factors."

The method uses ElectroEncephaloGraphic (EEG) signals and combines motor with speech imagery to allow for tasks that involve multiple degrees of freedom (DoF). The main approach utilizes the covariance matrix descriptor as feature, and the Relevance Vector Machines (RVM) classifier. The novel contributions include, (1) a new method to select representative data to update the RVM model, and (2) an online classifier which is an adaptively-weighted mixture of RVM models to account for the users' exploration and exploitation processes during the learning phase. Instead of evaluating the subjects' performance solely based on the conventional metric of accuracy, we analyze their skill's improvement based on 3 other criteria, namely the confusion matrix's quality, the separability of the data, and their instability. After collecting calibration data for 8 minutes in the first run, 8 participants were able to control the system while receiving visual feedback in the subsequent runs. We observed significant improvement in all subjects, including two of them who fell into the BCI illiteracy category. Our proposed BCI system complements the existing approaches in several aspects. First, the co-adaptation paradigm not only adapts the classifiers, but also allows the users to actively discover their own way to use the BCI through their exploration and exploitation processes. Furthermore, the auto-calibrating system can be used immediately with a minimal calibration time. Finally, this is the first work to combine motor and speech imagery in an online feedback experiment to provide multiple DoF for BCI control applications."

Through inhibition of type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), a novel strategy, we aimed to determine the effect of ADMA on renal fibrosis and explore its underlying working mechanisms. After sham or unilateral ureter ligation (UUO) operation, 20–25 g male c57 mice were treated with vehicle or PT1001B, an inhibitor of type I PRMTs, for 13 d. Moreover, human kidney 2 (HK2) and normal rat kidney 49F (NRK-49F) cells were treated with various concentrations of PT1001B or ADMA in the presence of 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β. We found that treatment with PT1001B increased the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, the expression of αsmooth muscle actin, and connective tissue growth factor in UUO-induced fibrotic kidneys, which is correlated with reduced expression of PRMT1, reduced the production of ADMA, and increased expression of uromodulin. In TGF-β-stimulated HK2 and NRK-49F cells, PT1001B dose-dependently inhibited ADMA production, increased NO concentrations, and enhanced the expression of profibrotic proteins. Exogenous addition of ADMA inhibited the expression of profibrotic proteins dose-dependently and attenuated the profibrotic effect of PT1001B. Moreover, ADMA reduced the NO concentration in PT1001B-treated HK2 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2922432733,"Background Due to changes in Polish society resulting from a significant inflow of immigrants to Poland, the need to develop the cultural competences of various professional groups who have contact with immigrants in their work has increased. These groups should include healthcare professionals, especially because of the significant increase in the number of culturally diverse patients. Therefore, medical education in Poland has had to rapidly adapt to this novel situation. For instance, the teaching process should be now more focused on the development and evaluation of the cultural competences of prospective health care workers. However, there is still a lack of standardized, valid and reliable instruments to assess cross-cultural competences among healthcare professionals. The purpose of the present paper was to describe, for the first time, the translation, adaptation, and psychometric evaluation of the Polish version of the Cross-Cultural Competence Inventory. Methods Across two studies, we examined psychometric properties of the Cross-Cultural Competence Inventory (CCCI) such as reliability (i.e. internal consistency, test-retest reliability, factor structure) and validity (i.e. theoretical, criteria, convergent). In the first study, 408 participants (75% were healthcare professionals) completed the Polish version of the CCCI and the Positive/Negative Attitude Towards Culturally Divergent People Questionnaire. In the second study, 317 participants (97% were healthcare professionals) completed the CCCI twice, with an interval of at least 22 days. In addition, across two study sessions, participants completed questionnaires constructed to measure (a) cultural intelligence, (b) need for cognitive closure, (c) emphatic sensitiveness, (d) emotional intelligence, (e) self-esteem, (f) social desirability, and (g) personality. Finally, to additionally examine the theoretical validity, 36 professional cross-cultural competence trainers completed the CCCI during a one-session study. Results Our findings confirm the reliability and validity of the CCCI. More precisely, in study 1 we proved the theoretical validity and reliability (i.e. internal consistency) of the CCCI. While the assumed structure did not fit the data well, all items were significantly related to the general factor, thus providing strong support for the usage of the total score of the CCCI. In study 2, we additionally estimated the test-retest reliability and theoretical, criterion and convergent validity. Across two studies we were able to successfully confirm these psychometric properties. The reliability was satisfactory and ranged from .83 to .86. We also observed a high and significant positive correlation between CCCI and the Cultural Intelligence Scale, which measures a concept similar to the one measured by CCCI. In addition, a significant relationship between intercultural competences (CCCI) and other variables such as personality, empathic sensitivity, emotional intelligence, self-esteem (positive correlations) and the need for cognitive closure (mainly negative correlation) were demonstrated. Conclusions The obtained results support the usage of the CCCI questionnaire in scientific research, such as, for example, among healthcare professionals (nurses, doctors) and students of medical fields (nursing, medicine)."

Here, we report the efficient conversion of C-to-T or G-to-A in X. tropicalis using the rat apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 1–XTEN-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-associated protein 9 (Cas9) nickase-uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor-nuclear localization sequence base editor [base editor 3 (BE3)]. Coinjection of guide RNA and the Cas9 mutant complex mRNA into 1-cell stage X. tropicalis embryos caused precise C-to-T or G-to-A substitution in 14 out of 19 tested sites with efficiencies of 5–75%, which allowed for easy establishment of stable lines. Targeting the conserved T-box 5 R237 and Tyr C28 residues in X. tropicalis with the BE3 system mimicked human Holt-Oram syndrome and oculocutaneous albinism type 1A, respectively. Our data indicate that BE3 is an easy and efficient tool for precise base editing in X. tropicalis.—Shi, Z., Xin, H., Tian, D., Lian, J., Wang, J., Liu, G., Ran, R., Shi, S., Zhang, Z., Shi, Y., Deng, Y., Hou, C., Chen, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2921371953,"Replicative DNA polymerases are frequently stalled at damaged template strands. Stalled replication forks are restored by the DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways, error-prone translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) to cope with excessive DNA damage, and error-free template switching (TS) by homologous DNA recombination. PDIP38 (Pol-delta interacting protein of 38 kDa), also called Pol δ-interacting protein 2 (PolDIP2), physically associates with TLS DNA polymerases, polymerase η (Polη), Polλ, and PrimPol, and activates them in vitro. It remains unclear whether PDIP38 promotes TLS in vivo, since no method allows for measuring individual TLS events in mammalian cells. We disrupted the PDIP38 gene, generating PDIP38-/- cells from the chicken DT40 and human TK6 B cell lines. These PDIP38-/- cells did not show a significant sensitivity to either UV or H2O2, a phenotype not seen in any TLS-polymerase-deficient DT40 or TK6 mutants. DT40 provides a unique opportunity of examining individual TLS and TS events by the nucleotide sequence analysis of the immunoglobulin variable (Ig V) gene as the cells continuously diversify Ig V by TLS (non-templated Ig V hypermutation) and TS (Ig gene conversion) during in vitro culture. PDIP38-/- cells showed a shift in Ig V diversification from TLS to TS. We measured the relative usage of TLS and TS in TK6 cells at a chemically synthesized UV damage (CPD) integrated into genomic DNA. The loss of PDIP38 also caused an increase in the relative usage of TS. The number of UV-induced sister chromatid exchanges, TS events associated with crossover, was increased a few times in PDIP38-/- human and chicken cells. Collectively, the loss of PDIP38 consistently causes a shift in DDT from TLS to TS without enhancing cellular sensitivity to DNA damage. We propose that PDIP38 controls the relative usage of TLS and TS increasing usage of TLS without changing the overall capability of DDT."
https://openalex.org/W2921099868,"Cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimens are frequently used for treatments of solid tumors. However, tumor cells may have inherent or acquired cisplatin resistance, and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We performed genome-wide screening of genes implicated in cisplatin resistance in A375 human melanoma cells. A substantial fraction of genes whose disruptions cause cisplatin sensitivity or resistance overlap with those whose disruptions lead to increased or decreased cell growth, respectively. Protein translation, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex assembly, signal recognition particle-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane, and mRNA catabolic processes are the top biologic processes responsible for cisplatin sensitivity. In contrast, proteasome-mediated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, negative regulations of cellular catabolic process, and regulation of cellular protein localization are the top biologic processes responsible for cisplatin resistance. ZNRF3, a ubiquitin ligase known to be a target and negative feedback regulator of Wnt-β-catenin signaling, enhances cisplatin resistance in normal and melanoma cells independently of β-catenin. Ariadne-1 homolog (ARIH1), another ubiquitin ligase, also enhances cisplatin resistance in normal and melanoma cells. By regulating ARIH1, neurofibromin 2, a tumor suppressor, enhances cisplatin resistance in melanoma but not normal cells. Our results shed new lights on cisplatin resistance mechanisms and may be useful for development of cisplatin-related treatment strategies.-Ko, T., Li, S. Genome-wide screening identifies novel genes and biological processes implicated in cisplatin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2921499293,"Most organisms on Earth possess circadian rhythms in their physiology and behaviors that allow them to resonate with the cycling environment over a 24-h period. However, in human society, a substantial quantity of jobs requires non-24-h working and rest or shift schedules, which causes more or less misalignment in circadian rhythms and disorders as a consequence. In this work, we conducted a sleep deprivation (SD) and non-24-h working and rest schedule (8 h on and 4 h off) experiment over 10 d in total and measured the changes in a series of physiologic and cognitive parameters. The results show that although the subjects could sleep during the schedule, their sleepiness increased significantly. Actigraphy data suggest that a 12-h schedule might result in chronic SD. Along with the increased sleepiness revealed by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale questionnaire, the neurobehavioral psychomotor vigilance test data reveal that, compared with the control period, the reaction time of the subjects was significantly delayed. The saliva insulin levels were significantly changed in the morning in SD and non-24-h cycles. Salivary biochemical parameters were also altered, including aspartate aminotransferase and K+. 16S rRNA-based analysis of the salivary microbiota showed differentially changed patterns in bacteria composition and concentration. Together, these data demonstrate that an abnormal working and rest schedule might produce comprehensive interference with circadian rhythms, metabolism, and cognition.-Ma, H., Li, Y., Liang, H., Chen, S., Pan, S., Chang, L., Li, S., Zhang, Y., Liu, X., Xu, Y., Shao, Y., Yang, Y., Guo, J.

https://openalex.org/W2919159242,"Accidental radiation exposure that is due to a nuclear accident or terrorism using radioactive materials has severe detrimental effects on human health, and it can manifest as acute radiation syndrome depending on the dose and distribution of the radiation. Therefore, the development of radiation countermeasure agents is urgently needed to protect humans against radiation injury. Besides nuclear DNA, the mitochondria are important targets of ionizing radiation (IR) because these organelles generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recently, we revealed that mitochondrial ROS-activated cell signaling is associated with IR-induced tumor formation. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of ascorbic acid and epicatechin (EC) in scavenging ROS as radiation countermeasure agents by using human cells and mouse. Preradiation and postradiation treatments with EC mitigate ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage, IR-induced oxidative stress responses including reduction of superoxide dismutase activity, and elevated nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 expression, and they improve human fibroblast survival. As well as in vitro, EC mitigated ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage after exposure to IR in vivo in mouse platelets. Furthermore, oral administration of EC significantly enhanced the recovery of mouse hematopoietic cells from radiation injury in vivo. In summary, EC is a potentially viable countermeasure agent that is immediately effective against accidental IR exposure by targeting mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress.—Shimura, T., Koyama, M., Aono, D., Kunugita, N.

https://openalex.org/W2920127893,"Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease characterized by overproduction of type 1 IFN that causes multiple organ dysfunctions. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) that secrete large amounts of IFN have recently been implicated in the initiation of the disease in preclinical mouse models. Sphingosine-1-phosphate, a bioactive sphingolipid metabolite, is produced by 2 highly conserved isoenzymes, sphingosine kinase (SphK) 1 and SphK2, and regulates diverse processes important for immune responses and autoimmunity. However, not much is known about the role of SphK2 in autoimmune disorders. In this work, we examined the role of SphK2 in pDC development and activation and in the pristane-induced lupus model in mice that mimics the hallmarks of the human disease. Increases in pDC-specific markers were observed in peripheral blood of SphK2 knockout mice. In agreement, the absence of SphK2 increased the differentiation of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand dendritic cells as well as expression of endosomal TLRs, TLR7 and TLR9, that modulate production of IFN. Surprisingly, however, SphK2 deficiency did not affect the initiation or progression of pristane-induced lupus. Moreover, although absence of SphK2 increased pDC frequency in pristane-induced lupus, there were no major changes in their activation status. Additionally, SphK2 expression was unaltered in lupus patients. Taken together, our results suggest that SphK2 may play a role in dendritic cell development. Yet, because its deletion had no effect on the clinical lupus parameters in this preclinical model, inhibitors of SphK2 might not be useful for treatment of this devastating disease.—Mohammed, S., Vineetha, N.

https://openalex.org/W2920964437,"The objective of this study was to analyze the relationships of osmotic and mechanical stability of erythrocytes with anthropometric, biochemical, hematologic and hemodynamic variables in pregnant women with preeclampsia (PE). The studied population consisted of 20 normotensive patients and 16 patients with PE. Patients with PE presented worse gestational outcome, greater hematologic impairment, erythrocytes osmotically more stable in vitro, but in conditions of isotonicity with the in vivo medium, in addition to hyperflow in orbital territory, when compared to normotensive patients. The correlation analysis between anthropometric, hematologic and hemodynamic variables in patients with PE indicated that erythrocytes with lower volumes and lower levels of hemoglobin favor the occurrence of a better gestational outcome, because they are more stable and because they are associated with a decrease in the hemodynamic changes present in the disease. This should mean that the tendency to microcytosis, probably due to a mechanism of compensatory mechanical selection, is a desirable characteristic in the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2919647630,"Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major challenge in liver resection and transplantation surgeries. Previous studies have revealed that guanine nucleotide–binding protein G(i)α2 (GNAI2) was involved in the progression of myocardial and cerebral I/R injury, but the role and function of GNAI2 in hepatic I/R have not been elucidated. The hepatocyte-specific GNAI2 knockout (GNAI2hep−/−) mice were generated and subjected to hepatic I/R injury. Primary hepatocytes isolated from GNAI2hep−/− and GNAI2flox/flox mice were cultured and challenged to hypoxia-reoxygenation insult. The specific function of GNAI2 in I/R-triggered hepatic injury and the underlying molecular mechanism were explored by various phenotypic analyses and molecular biology methods. In this study, we demonstrated that hepatic GNAI2 expression was significantly increased in liver transplantation patients and wild-type mice after hepatic I/R. Interestingly, hepatocyte-specific GNAI2 deficiency attenuated I/R-induced liver damage, inflammation cytokine expression, macrophage/neutrophil infiltration, and hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, up-regulation of GNAI2 phosphorylates mixed-lineage protein kinase 3 (MLK3) through direct binding, which exacerbated hepatic I/R damage via MAPK and NF-κB pathway activation. Furthermore, blocking MLK3 signaling reversed GNAI2-mediated hepatic I/R injury. Our study firstly identifies GNAI2 as a promising target for prevention of hepatic I/R-induced injury and related liver diseases.—Sun, Q., He, Q., Xu, J., Liu, Q., Lu, Y., Zhang, Z., Xu, X., Sun, B.

https://openalex.org/W2921881648,"The agglomeration of silica nanoparticles in aqueous solution is investigated from molecular simulations. Mimicking destabilization of colloidal solutions by full removal of protective moieties or surface charge, association of SiO2/Si(OH)4 core/shell particles leads to rapid proton transfer reactions that account for local silanole → silica ripening reactions. Yet, such virtually barrier-less binding is only observed within a limited contact zone. Agglomeration hence leads to the formation of oligomers of nanoparticles, whilst full merging into a compact precipitate is hampered by the need for extended structural reorganisation. Implementing sufficiently fast supply from colloidal solution, our simulations show the development of silica networks comprised of covalently bound, yet not fully merged nanoparticles. Within the oligomerized nanoparticle network, coordination numbers range from 2 to 5 -which is far below closest packing. Our simulations hence rationalize the formation of covalently bound network structures hosting extended pores. The resulting interfaces to the solvent show water immobilization only for the immediate contact layers, whilst the inner pores exhibit solvent mobility akin to bulk water."

This study compares several methodologies to elucidate the role of transmission chains in the dynamics of HIV spread in Quebec, Canada. Methods The Quebec Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) genotyping program database now includes viral sequences from close to 4,000 HIV-positive individuals classified as Men who have Sex with Men (MSMs), collected between 1996 and early 2016. Assessment of chain expansion may depend on the partitioning scheme used, and so, we produce estimates from several methods: the conventional Bayesian and maximum likelihood-bootstrap methods, in combination with a variety of schemes for applying a maximum distance criterion, and two other algorithms, DM-PhyClus, a Bayesian algorithm that produces a measure of uncertainty for proposed partitions, and the Gap Procedure, a fast non-phylogenetic approach. Sequences obtained from individuals in the Primary HIV Infection (PHI) stage serve to identify incident cases. We focus on the period ranging from January 1st 2012 to February 1st 2016. Results and conclusion The analyses reveal considerable overlap between chain estimates obtained from conventional methods, thus leading to similar estimates of recent temporal expansion. The Gap Procedure and DM-PhyClus suggest however moderately different chains. Nevertheless, all estimates stress that longer older chains are responsible for a sizeable proportion of the sampled incident cases among MSMs. Curbing the HIV epidemic will require strategies aimed specifically at preventing such growth."

Nevertheless, even in gadoxetate disodium-enhanced MR scans, very small hepatic metastases may be difficult to see.To investigate the potential of a contrast-optimised (phase-sensitive) inversion recovery MR sequence in gadoxetate disodium-enhanced scans for detection of hepatic metastases.With institutional review board approval and after written informed consent, 40 patients (18 male, 22 female) with suspected or known hepatic metastases were examined on a 1.5 T MR system. A T1-weighted gradient-echo volumetric-interpolated-breath-hold (VIBE) sequence was acquired as part of the standard imaging protocol 20 minutes after administration of gadoxetate disodium. Additionally, an IR sequence was acquired with an inversion time to suppress native signal from metastases. Overall image quality and delineation of lesions were assessed on VIBE as well as on magnitude-reconstructed (MAG) and phase-sensitive IR (PSIR) sequences. Lesion-to-liver contrast (LLC) was compared between VIBE and MAG images.Overall image quality was high in both VIBE and MAG IR sequences (VIBE 4.275; MAG 4.313), yet significantly lower in PSIR (4.038). Subjective delineation of lesions was higher on MAG and PSIR images compared to VIBE in all size groups with an overall statistically significant difference for VIBE vs. MAG vs. PSIR (p < .001) in the variance analysis. Mean LLC was 0.35±0.01 for VIBE sequences, and 0.73±0.01 for MAG.Contrast-optimised PSIR seems to improve imaging characteristics of hepatic metastases in gadoxetate disodium-enhanced scans compared to T1 gradient-echo VIBE sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2922037338,"Tubulogenesis, the organization of epithelial cells into tubular structures, is an essential step during renal organogenesis as well as during the regeneration process of renal tubules after injury. In the present study, endothelial cell-derived factors that modulate tubule formation were examined using an in vitro human tubulogenesis system. When human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) were cultured in gels, tubular structures with lumens were induced in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Aquaporin 1 was localized in the apical membrane of these tubular structures, suggesting that these structures are morphologically equivalent to renal tubules in vivo. HGF-induced tubule formation was significantly enhanced when co-cultured with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) or in the presence of HUVEC-conditioned medium (HUVEC-CM). Co-culture with HUVECs did not induce tubular structures in the absence of HGF. A phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array revealed that HUVEC-CM markedly enhanced phosphorylation of Ret, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor, in HGF-induced tubular structures compared to those without HUVEC-CM. HUVECs produced GDNF, and RPTECs expressed both Ret and GDNF family receptor alpha1 (co-receptor). HGF-induced tubule formation was significantly enhanced by addition of GDNF. Interestingly, not only HGF but also GDNF significantly induced phosphorylation of the HGF receptor, Met. These data indicate that endothelial cell-derived GDNF potentiates the tubulogenic properties of HGF and may play a critical role in the epithelial-endothelial crosstalk during renal tubulogenesis as well as tubular regeneration after injury."

Control of C. jejuni load in the poultry primary production is recognized as an avenue to reduce human exposure to the pathogen. As for now, no commercially applicable control methods exist at the farm. Several studies tested egg yolk powders, potentiated or not against C. jejuni, as feed additives for chicken and suggested that the quantity and quality of the antibodies presence in the yolk are determinant factors for the full success of this approach. Unfortunately, data from these studies inconsistently showed a reduction of cecal C. jejuni carriage.

Secondly, these powders were microencapsulated and recharacterized. Finally the protected powders were tested as a feed additive to destabilize C. jejuni colonization in an in vivo assay. Despite the in vitro results indicating the ability of the egg yolk powders to recognize Campylobacter and potentially alter its colonization of the chicken caecum, these results were not confirmed in the in vivo trial despite that specific caecal IgY directed toward Campylobacter were detected in the groups receiving the protected powders. More research is needed on Campylobacter in order to effectively control this pathogen at the farm."
