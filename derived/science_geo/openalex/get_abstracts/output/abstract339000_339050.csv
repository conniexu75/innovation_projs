https://openalex.org/W2001477626,"Activity in dorsal giant interneurons of the cockroach initiates flight movements if leg contact with a substrate is prevented. The same interneurons initiate activity associated with running when leg contact is maintained. Thus, which one of two completely different behaviors the giant interneurons evoke depends on the presence or absence of leg contact."
https://openalex.org/W2062462644,The staphylinid beetle Trichopsenius frosti Seevers has the same cuticular hydrocarbons as those of its host termite Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) and it biosynthesizes them. These cuticular hydrocarbons probably serve as the primary mechanism by which Trichopsenius frosti integrates itself into the termite colony.
https://openalex.org/W2025809181,"Speed of pollen tube growth is positively correlated with the quality of the resultant sporophytic generation. Therefore, gametophytic competition may be an important adaptive mechanism. Furthermore, pollen tube growth rates may be used to predict the quality of F(1) crosses in crop species."
https://openalex.org/W1994424192,"An expedition under ""Projet Rhéomarge"" traced marine deposits along the Sénégal estuary. Leveled and dated samples have made it possible to reconstruct portions of paleogeoids of 6500, 5500, and 1800 years before present. The surfaces of these geoids show that the tilt across continental margins predicted by mathematical models is less than 1 meter from the coast to 120 kilometers inland."

Foster Outstanding Explorer Award The Outstanding Explorer Award is given in recognition of distinguished and outstanding achievement in exploration for petroleum or mineral resources. William A. Zagorski Robert R. Berg Outstanding Research Award The Robert R. Berg Outstanding Research Award is presented in recognition of a singular achievement in petroleum geoscience research and named in honor of a man who himself contributed greatly to the science of petroleum geology.

https://openalex.org/W1974599428,"Basal till was identified in two sediment cores collected about 69 kilometers southeast of Nantucket Island on the east and west sides of Great South Channel. These are the first samples of till collected on the outer continental shelf off the northeastern United States. The carbon-14 age of the total organic carbon in the tills provides a ""no older than"" age of about 20,000 years before present and suggests that the tills were deposited during the late Wisconsinan glaciation. This conclusion is in support of the hypothesis of an extensive Laurentide ice sheet that extended to the northern side of Georges Bank."
