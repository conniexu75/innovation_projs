Here we show that the ability of Cpf1 to process its own CRISPR RNA (crRNA) can be used to simplify multiplexed genome editing. Using a single customized CRISPR array, we edit up to four genes in mammalian cells and three in the mouse brain, simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W2560204497,"Our lives revolve around sharing experiences and memories with others. When different people recount the same events, how similar are their underlying neural representations? Participants viewed a 50-min movie, then verbally described the events during functional MRI, producing unguided detailed descriptions lasting up to 40 min. As each person spoke, event-specific spatial patterns were reinstated in default-network, medial-temporal, and high-level visual areas. Individual event patterns were both highly discriminable from one another and similar among people, suggesting consistent spatial organization. In many high-order areas, patterns were more similar between people recalling the same event than between recall and perception, indicating systematic reshaping of percept into memory. These results reveal the existence of a common spatial organization for memories in high-level cortical areas, where encoded information is largely abstracted beyond sensory constraints, and that neural patterns during perception are altered systematically across people into shared memory representations for real-life events."
https://openalex.org/W2560510482,"Peter 't Hoen, Lude Franke, Bastiaan Heijmans and colleagues present a combined analysis of methylome and transcriptome data from a large collection of whole-blood samples to infer the downstream effects of disease-associated variants. They identify a large number of trait-associated SNPs influencing methylation of CpG sites in trans, providing insights into the downstream functional effects of many disease-associated variants. Most disease-associated genetic variants are noncoding, making it challenging to design experiments to understand their functional consequences1,2. Identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has been a powerful approach to infer the downstream effects of disease-associated variants, but most of these variants remain unexplained3,4. The analysis of DNA methylation, a key component of the epigenome5,6, offers highly complementary data on the regulatory potential of genomic regions7,8. Here we show that disease-associated variants have widespread effects on DNA methylation in trans that likely reflect differential occupancy of trans binding sites by cis-regulated transcription factors. Using multiple omics data sets from 3,841 Dutch individuals, we identified 1,907 established trait-associated SNPs that affect the methylation levels of 10,141 different CpG sites in trans (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). These included SNPs that affect both the expression of a nearby transcription factor (such as NFKB1, CTCF and NKX2-3) and methylation of its respective binding site across the genome. Trans methylation QTLs effectively expose the downstream effects of disease-associated variants."
https://openalex.org/W2560048039,"Bastiaan Heijmans, Peter ’t Hoen, Lude Franke and colleagues describe a strategy to identify context-dependent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). They apply their method to peripheral blood RNA–seq data from 2,116 unrelated individuals and discover 23,060 significant cis-regulated genes, of which 12% showed context-dependent eQTL effects. Genetic risk factors often localize to noncoding regions of the genome with unknown effects on disease etiology1,2. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) help to explain the regulatory mechanisms underlying these genetic associations3,4,5,6. Knowledge of the context that determines the nature and strength of eQTLs may help identify cell types relevant to pathophysiology and the regulatory networks underlying disease7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we generated peripheral blood RNA–seq data from 2,116 unrelated individuals and systematically identified context-dependent eQTLs using a hypothesis-free strategy that does not require previous knowledge of the identity of the modifiers. Of the 23,060 significant cis-regulated genes (false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05), 2,743 (12%) showed context-dependent eQTL effects. The majority of these effects were influenced by cell type composition. A set of 145 cis-eQTLs depended on type I interferon signaling. Others were modulated by specific transcription factors binding to the eQTL SNPs."
https://openalex.org/W2560290489,"Chi-Hua Chen and colleagues report a GWAS for five personality traits and identify four loci associated with extraversion and two associated with neuroticism at genome-wide significance. They find that the five personality traits are genetically correlated and identify genetic correlations between personality traits and psychiatric disorders. Personality is influenced by genetic and environmental factors1 and associated with mental health. However, the underlying genetic determinants are largely unknown. We identified six genetic loci, including five novel loci2,3, significantly associated with personality traits in a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (N = 123,132–260,861). Of these genome-wide significant loci, extraversion was associated with variants in WSCD2 and near PCDH15, and neuroticism with variants on chromosome 8p23.1 and in L3MBTL2. We performed a principal component analysis to extract major dimensions underlying genetic variations among five personality traits and six psychiatric disorders (N = 5,422–18,759). The first genetic dimension separated personality traits and psychiatric disorders, except that neuroticism and openness to experience were clustered with the disorders. High genetic correlations were found between extraversion and attention-deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and between openness and schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The second genetic dimension was closely aligned with extraversion–introversion and grouped neuroticism with internalizing psychopathology (e.g., depression or anxiety)."

https://openalex.org/W2557659496,"Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the destruction of pancreatic β cells, and generating new insulin-producing cells from other cell types is a major aim of regenerative medicine. One promising approach is transdifferentiation of developmentally related pancreatic cell types, including glucagon-producing α cells. In a genetic model, loss of the master regulatory transcription factor Arx is sufficient to induce the conversion of α cells to functional β-like cells. Here, we identify artemisinins as small molecules that functionally repress Arx by causing its translocation to the cytoplasm. We show that the protein gephyrin is the mammalian target of these antimalarial drugs and that the mechanism of action of these molecules depends on the enhancement of GABAA receptor signaling. Our results in zebrafish, rodents, and primary human pancreatic islets identify gephyrin as a druggable target for the regeneration of pancreatic β cell mass from α cells."
https://openalex.org/W2559389868,"The recent discovery that genetically modified α cells can regenerate and convert into β-like cells in vivo holds great promise for diabetes research. However, to eventually translate these findings to human, it is crucial to discover compounds with similar activities. Herein, we report the identification of GABA as an inducer of α-to-β-like cell conversion in vivo. This conversion induces α cell replacement mechanisms through the mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells that adopt an α cell identity prior to being converted into β-like cells, solely upon sustained GABA exposure. Importantly, these neo-generated β-like cells are functional and can repeatedly reverse chemically induced diabetes in vivo. Similarly, the treatment of transplanted human islets with GABA results in a loss of α cells and a concomitant increase in β-like cell counts, suggestive of α-to-β-like cell conversion processes also in humans. This newly discovered GABA-induced α cell-mediated β-like cell neogenesis could therefore represent an unprecedented hope toward improved therapies for diabetes."

The cellular tropism of ZIKV and the identity of attachment factors used by the virus to gain access to key cell types involved in pathogenesis are under intense investigation. Initial studies suggested that ZIKV preferentially targets neural progenitor cells (NPCs), providing an explanation for the developmental phenotypes observed in some pregnancies. The AXL protein has been nominated as a key attachment factor for ZIKV in several cell types including NPCs. However, here we show that genetic ablation of AXL has no effect on ZIKV entry or ZIKV-mediated cell death in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NPCs or cerebral organoids. These findings call into question the utility of AXL inhibitors for preventing birth defects after infection and suggest that further studies of viral attachment factors in NPCs are needed."

Recently, SdeA, an effector protein of pathogenic Legionella pneumophila, was shown to mediate NAD-dependent and ATP-independent ubiquitin transfer to host proteins. Here, we identify a phosphodiesterase domain in SdeA that efficiently catalyzes phosphoribosylation of ubiquitin on a specific arginine via an ADP-ribose-ubiquitin intermediate. SdeA also catalyzes a chemically and structurally distinct type of substrate ubiquitination by conjugating phosphoribosylated ubiquitin to serine residues of protein substrates via a phosphodiester bond. Furthermore, phosphoribosylation of ubiquitin prevents activation of E1 and E2 enzymes of the conventional ubiquitination cascade, thereby impairing numerous cellular processes including mitophagy, TNF signaling, and proteasomal degradation.

We propose that phosphoribosylation of ubiquitin potently modulates ubiquitin functions in mammalian cells. Ubiquitination is a prevalent post-translational modification that regulates a number of key cellular processes (Grabbe et al., 2011Grabbe C. Husnjak K. Dikic I. The spatial and temporal organization of ubiquitin networks.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, Yau and Rape, 2016Yau R. Rape M. The increasing complexity of the ubiquitin code.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The known mechanism of conventional ubiquitination proceeds via a universally conserved three-enzyme cascade: ubiquitin (Ub) is first activated by an Ub-activating enzyme (E1) that consumes ATP to adenylate the C terminus of Ub and then forms a thioester bond between the Ub C terminus and its catalytic cysteine residue. This step is followed by the transfer of Ub to the catalytic cysteine of the Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2) and eventually to the substrate lysine with the help of Ub ligases (E3). This final transfer of Ub results in an amide bond between the ε-amino group of a substrate lysine and the C-terminal carboxylate of Ub (Hershko et al., 2000Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. The ubiquitin system.Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1073-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Three major types of E3 ligases are known in eukaryotic cells: (1) really interesting new gene (RING)-type E3s functioning as scaffolds, bringing Ub-charged E2s into close proximity of substrates, thereby facilitating Ub transfer from E2 to a substrate lysine; (2) homologous to the E6–AP C terminus (HECT)-type E3s forming a thioester intermediate with Ub before transferring it directly to the substrate; and (3) RING-in-between-RING (RBR)-type E3s working via a hybrid mechanism (Vittal et al., 2015Vittal V. Stewart M.D. Brzovic P.S. Klevit R.E. Regulating the regulators: recent revelations in the control of E3 ubiquitin ligases.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 21244-21251Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Ub itself contains seven lysine residues (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, Lys63) and an N-terminal methionine, which can be used in iterative ubiquitination reactions to form Ub chains in vivo (Yau and Rape, 2016Yau R. Rape M. The increasing complexity of the ubiquitin code.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Formation of Ub chains is mediated via an amide bond to a primary amine either on the side chain of lysines (Lys-linked ubiquitination) or on the N terminus of Ub (Met1-linked ubiquitination). These differently linked Ub chains have unique structural features that are recognized by Ub-binding domains (UBDs) present in Ub receptors (Husnjak and Dikic, 2012Husnjak K. Dikic I.

The bacterial weaponry: lessons from Shigella.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2006; 1072: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Among gram-negative bacteria, Legionella pneumophila (LP) has the largest arsenal of effector proteins and secretes ∼300 toxins into host cells via the type IV secretion system (T4SS) (Hubber and Roy, 2010Hubber A. Roy C.R. Modulation of host cell function by Legionella pneumophila type IV effectors.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 261-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The SidE family of LP effectors including SidE, SdeA, SdeB, and SdeC was shown to be important for the intracellular replication of Legionella in host cells (Bardill et al., 2005Bardill J.P. Miller J.L. Vogel J.P. IcmS-dependent translocation of SdeA into macrophages by the Legionella pneumophila type IV secretion system.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the intracellular growth defect observed in a strain lacking all members of the SidE family can be rescued by expressing SdeA alone, indicating that the members of this protein family perform redundant functions. SdeA was recently shown to ubiquitinate several endoplasmic reticulum-associated human Rab GTPases, resulting in the downregulation of their activity (Qiu et al., 2016Qiu J. Sheedlo M.J. Yu K. Tan Y. Nakayasu E.S. Das C. Liu X. Luo Z.-Q. Ubiquitination independent of E1 and E2 enzymes by bacterial effectors.Nature. 2016; 533: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike all known bacterial E3 ligases, SdeA does not hijack the host Ub machinery but catalyzes Ub transfer autonomously without the need of host E1 and E2 enzymes. This ATP-independent reaction requires only NAD+ as a co-factor, and ADP-ribosylation of Ub was suggested to be a possible intermediate step in the transfer reaction. However, the mechanism and the chemistry of the Ub transfer reaction to the substrate remained unknown. We now show that the mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase (mART) domain of SdeA and a newly identified phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain act successively to convert cellular Ub into phosphoribosylated Ub that can be conjugated to a serine residue of a target protein or to SdeA itself. This mechanism of SdeA-mediated ubiquitination is independent of the conventional E1-E2-E3 enzymatic cascade and results in the formation of a phosphodiester-bond between phosphoribosylated arginine 42 (Arg42) of Ub and the hydroxyl group of a substrate serine. More importantly, free phosphoribosylated ubiquitin produced by bacterial SdeA inhibits the host ubiquitination machinery, leading to a severe and eventually toxic disturbance of essential Ub-dependent cellular processes such as proteasomal degradation, TNF signaling, and mitophagy. SdeA can covalently couple Ub to substrate proteins in an ATP-independent manner and without exploiting the host ubiquitination machinery, using NAD+ as a cofactor instead (Qiu et al., 2016Qiu J. Sheedlo M.J. Yu K. Tan Y. Nakayasu E.S. Das C. Liu X. Luo Z.-Q. Ubiquitination independent of E1 and E2 enzymes by bacterial effectors.Nature. 2016; 533: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, SdeA-mediated ubiquitination constitutes a mechanism entirely distinct from the canonical enzymatic cascade of eukaryotic cells. In order to understand the chemistry behind this type of protein ubiquitination, we first analyzed the structural features of SdeA. Previous structural and biochemical studies have shown that SdeA contains an N-terminal deubiquitinase (DUB) domain spanning residues 1 to 200 and an mART domain spanning residues 500 to 1000 (Figure 1A) (Qiu et al., 2016Qiu J. Sheedlo M.J. Yu K. Tan Y. Nakayasu E.S. Das C. Liu X. Luo Z.-Q. Ubiquitination independent of E1 and E2 enzymes by bacterial effectors.Nature. 2016; 533: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, Sheedlo et al., 2015Sheedlo M.J. Qiu J. Tan Y. Paul L.N. Luo Z.-Q. Das C. Structural basis of substrate recognition by a bacterial deubiquitinase important for dynamics of phagosome ubiquitination.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 15090-15095Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our domain prediction analysis of SdeA revealed that the region between residues 200 and 500 is similar to the predicted PDE domain in the LP effector lpg1496 (Wong et al., 2015Wong K. Kozlov G. Zhang Y. Gehring K. Structure of the Legionella effector, lpg1496, suggests a role in nucleotide metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 24727-24737Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Figure S1A). It is worth mentioning that even though the structure of lpg1496 shows homology to several canonical PDE domains, attempts to establish its PDE activity toward a number of substrates (3′-AMP, 5′-AMP, ADP, ADP-ribose, 2′,3′-cAMP, 3′,5′-cAMP, and 3′,5′-cGMP) failed. Therefore annotation of the PDE domain in lpg1496 is only based on its structural homology to known PDE domains (Wong et al., 2015Wong K. Kozlov G. Zhang Y. Gehring K. Structure of the Legionella effector, lpg1496, suggests a role in nucleotide metabolism.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 24727-24737Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The SdeA PDE region shows 48% sequence similarity to the PDE domain of lpg1496 (167 residues aligned; Figure S1A) and 23% sequence similarity to the PDE domain in the well-characterized cyclic di-3′,5′-GMP phosphodiesterase PA4781 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Rinaldo et al., 2015Rinaldo S. Paiardini A. Stelitano V. Brunotti P. Cervoni L. Fernicola S. Protano C. Vitali M. Cutruzzolà F. Giardina G. Structural basis of functional diversification of the HD-GYP domain revealed by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA4781 protein, which displays an unselective bimetallic binding site.J. Bacteriol. 2015; 197: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we expected PDE activity for SdeA. We hypothesized that the predicted PDE domain in SdeA may cleave the pyrophosphate bond between ADP α and β phosphates in ADP-ribosylated Ub, leading to the formation of phosphoribosylated Ub and release of AMP. The PDE domain of SdeA was modeled using the crystal structure of the putative PDE domain of lpg1496 (PDB code: 5BU1), and we mutated the predicted catalytic residues of the PDE domain and the mART domain in SdeA constructs spanning residues 200 to 1005 (ΔNC SdeA) (Figure 1B). These constructs were then used to modify Ub with biotin-labeled NAD (biotin is attached to the amino group of the adenine base) as per the experimental scheme shown in Figure 1C. Streptavidin blots revealed that the wild-type (WT) protein completely processed ADP-ribosylated Ub to phosphoribosyl-Ub, whereas the PDE domain mutant proteins H284A, H288A, and R344A were defective in cleavage of the pyrophosphate bond in ADP-ribosylated Ub (Figure 1D). As expected, the mART domain mutant (E867A, E869A, or EE/AA) of SdeA failed to ADP-ribosylate Ub. Ub treated with SdeA WT could be visualized with phospho-specific Pro-Q Diamond stain due to the exposed phosphate of the phosphoribose moiety (Daniels et al., 2014Daniels C.M. Ong S.-E. Leung A.K.L. Phosphoproteomic approach to characterize protein mono- and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation sites from cells.J. Proteome Res. 2014; 13: 3510-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), whereas Ub modified by the PDE mutants did not show staining with the phosphoprotein stain (Figures 1C and 1E). We then quantified the AMP released in the reactions catalyzed by ΔNC SdeA WT and PDE mutant H284A (Figure S1B). Compared to WT, H284A mutant SdeA showed only background level release of AMP in the reaction with NAD and ubiquitin. Together, these biochemical experiments revealed that the PDE domain of SdeA catalyzes conversion of ADP-ribosylated Ub to phosphoribosyl Ub and releases AMP. In addition to the biochemical approaches, we analyzed the Ub modification by ΔNC SdeA WT and the PDE mutant with high-resolution ETD (electron transfer dissociation) mass spectrometry. As we have recently shown, this mass spectrometric technique allows for precise mapping of ADP-ribosylation and phosphoribosylation on all possible amino acids by preserving the highly labile bonds of these modifications (Leidecker et al., 2016Leidecker O. Bonfiglio J.J. Colby T. Zhang Q. Atanassov I. Zaja R. Palazzo L. Stockum A. Ahel I. Matic I. Serine is a new target residue for endogenous ADP-ribosylation on histones.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2016; (Published online October 10, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1038/nchembio.2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This unbiased identification of modification sites is important given that ADP-ribosylation has promiscuous amino-acid specificity (Daniels et al., 2015aDaniels C.M. Ong S.-E. Leung A.K.L. The promise of proteomics for the study of ADP-ribosylation.Mol. Cell. 2015; 58: 911-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We unambiguously mapped the site of ADP-ribosylation (Qiu et al., 2016Qiu J. Sheedlo M.J. Yu K. Tan Y. Nakayasu E.S. Das C. Liu X. Luo Z.-Q. Ubiquitination independent of E1 and E2 enzymes by bacterial effectors.Nature. 2016; 533: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) as well as phosphoribosylation to arginine 42 of Ub in high-resolution ETD spectra (Figures 1F and 1G). Phosphoribosylation of Ub was detected in ΔNC SdeA WT reaction mixtures, indicating that SdeA WT is able to fully process ADP-ribosylated Ub (Figure 1F). In contrast, only ADP-ribosylation of Ub was detected in the samples containing the H284A mutant (Figure 1G). Curiously, Qiu et al. have reported that SdeA showed no ADP-ribosylation activity when incubated with mammalian cell lysate in the presence of radiolabeled NAD+ (32P-α-NAD). We think that this is an effect of the PDE domain cleaving off radiolabeled AMP from the ADP-ribosyl group while leaving an unlabeled phosphoribosyl moiety on its substrates, rendering the modification undetectable by autoradiography (Qiu et al., 2016Qiu J. Sheedlo M.J. Yu K. Tan Y. Nakayasu E.S. Das C. Liu X. Luo Z.-Q.

The released AMP was measured using AMP-Glo assay (Promega). Each experiment was done in triplicate and the data are represented as mean ± SEM (see STAR Methods). Intriguingly, SdeA can attach Ub lacking the C-terminal diGly motif to substrate proteins devoid of any lysine residue that would serve as acceptor in the canonical ubiquitination reaction (Qiu et al., 2016Qiu J. Sheedlo M.J. Yu K. Tan Y. Nakayasu E.S. Das C. Liu X. Luo Z.-Q. Ubiquitination independent of E1 and E2 enzymes by bacterial effectors.Nature. 2016; 533: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Based on the deduced function of PDE domain of SdeA (Figures 1 and S1), we hypothesized that the phosphoribose would form a bridge between Arg42 of Ub and substrate. We tested whether the PDE activity of SdeA is necessary for substrate ubiquitination by SdeA. The SdeA PDE mutant H284A failed to both auto-ubiquitinate SdeA and ubiquitinate Rab33b (Figure S2A). This indicates that the cleavage of the pyrophosphate bond in ADP-ribosylated Ub is an essential step in the Ub transfer reaction mediated by SdeA. To gain insight into the chemical nature of SdeA-mediated Ub linkage and identify the modification sites, we performed trypsin digestion and used mass spectrometry to characterize the branched peptides resulting from the covalent attachment of the Ub peptide bearing Arg42 to Rab33b and SdeA peptides. We analyzed the peptides by high-resolution ETD to preserve the phosphoribose bridge and thus allow mapping of modification sites on substrate proteins. We discovered serine as the modified residue on target proteins. In all cases, serine residues of SdeA and Rab33b were bridged to Arg42 of Ub via a phosphoribosyl linker. Specifically, we mapped five serine sites, one in Rab33b (S154) (Figure 2A) and four in the C-terminal region of the SdeA mART domain (S936, S984, S986, S1005) (Figures 2C and S2B–S2D). Accordingly, mutations of several modified serines in SdeA resulted in reduced auto-ubiquitination (Figure 2E, lanes 1 to 11). However, mutating serine 154 of Rab33b did not affect the amount of ubiquitinated Rab33, indicating that there are other sites in Rab33b that are ubiquitinated apart from S154. Next, we set to determine the chemical nature of the linkage between the phosphoribosyl group and the substrate proteins. We reasoned that the phosphate group of phosphoribose is attached to the side chains of target serine residues. To test this hypothesis, we performed a different type of mass spectrometric analysis, called collision-induced dissociation (CID). Whereas ETD allows site mapping by preserving the phosphoribosyl linker, CID induces its cleavage, which we reasoned would provide information on its attachment chemistry. In high-resolution CID spectra of Ub-linked SdeA and Rab33b peptides, fragment ions corresponding to phosphorylated as well as dehydrated forms of the substrate peptide show that SdeA links phosphoribosyl-Ub via a phosphodiester bond to the hydroxyl group of serine residues in its substrates (Figures 2B and 2D). Next, we hypothesized that the pyrophosphate bond cleavage in ADP-ribosylated Ub and the attachment of phosphoribosylated Ub to SdeA substrates are coupled, meaning they take place simultaneously in the active site of the SdeA PDE domain. To test this, we performed in vitro ubiquitination reactions with ΔNC SdeA WT and H284A mutant in the presence of either ADP-ribosylated or phosphoribosylated Ub, without adding NAD+. ADP-ribosylated and phosphoribosylated Ub were generated as illustrated in Figure S2E and analyzed using phosphoprotein stain (Figure S2F). SdeA carried out auto-ubiquitination and ubiquitination of Rab33b only in the presence of ADP-ribosylated Ub but not in the presence of phosphoribosylated Ub in a PDE domain-dependent manner (Figure 2F). This indicates that pyrophosphate bond cleavage and ligation of phosphoribosylated Ub to substrate serines are not independent but coupled processes performed by the PDE domain of SdeA. We examined the PDE domain model to find SdeA residues involved in ligation of phosphoribosylated Ub to substrate serines. The conserved D396 and K397 of SdeA are close to the PDE domain’s active site (Figure S2G). Mutating D396 and K397 but not E395 to alanines affected auto-ubiquitination of SdeA (Figure 2E, lanes 12 to 14). Our results provide a deeper understanding of the ubiquitination mechanism by SdeA, where Ub is first ADP-ribosylated on Arg42 by the mART domain. This is followed by the cleavage of the pyrophosphate bond between the α and the β phosphates in ADP-ribosylated Ub coupled to the attachment of the β phosphate to a substrate serine (Figure 2G). Interestingly, a few examples exist where Ub is attached to non-lysine residues such as cysteine, serine, and threonine of substrate proteins via an esterification reaction, and this modification is dependent on the canonical Ub cascade enzymes (Wang et al., 2012Wang X. Herr R.A. Hansen T.H. Ubiquitination of substrates by esterification.Traffic. 2012; 13: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This specific phosphoribosyl-bridged attachment of ubiquitin to serine residues of substrates has not been observed previously and therefore represents a unique biochemical linkage of Ub.Figure 2Mechanism of Ubiquitination by SdeAShow full caption(A) SdeA-catalyzed attachment of ubiquitin to Rab33b was analyzed after FASP digestion by high-resolution ETD fragmentation.(B) By high-resolution CID fragmentation, preferential cleavage of phosphoester bonds was induced.

Here, we report the discovery and characterization of a 7-kDa human microprotein we named non-annotated P-body dissociating polypeptide (NoBody). NoBody interacts with mRNA decapping proteins, which remove the 5' cap from mRNAs to promote 5'-to-3' decay. Decapping proteins participate in mRNA turnover and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). NoBody localizes to mRNA-decay-associated RNA-protein granules called P-bodies. Modulation of NoBody levels reveals that its abundance is anticorrelated with cellular P-body numbers and alters the steady-state levels of a cellular NMD substrate. These results implicate NoBody as a novel component of the mRNA decapping complex and demonstrate potential functionality of a newly discovered microprotein."
https://openalex.org/W2559865743,"Chromosome missegregation into a micronucleus can cause complex and localized genomic rearrangements known as chromothripsis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. Here we developed an inducible Y centromere-selective inactivation strategy by exploiting a CENP-A/histone H3 chimaera to directly examine the fate of missegregated chromosomes in otherwise diploid human cells. Using this approach, we identified a temporal cascade of events that are initiated following centromere inactivation involving chromosome missegregation, fragmentation, and re-ligation that span three consecutive cell cycles. Following centromere inactivation, a micronucleus harbouring the Y chromosome is formed in the first cell cycle. Chromosome shattering, producing up to 53 dispersed fragments from a single chromosome, is triggered by premature micronuclear condensation prior to or during mitotic entry of the second cycle. Lastly, canonical non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), but not homology-dependent repair, is shown to facilitate re-ligation of chromosomal fragments in the third cycle. Thus, initial errors in cell division can provoke further genomic instability through fragmentation of micronuclear DNAs coupled to NHEJ-mediated reassembly in the subsequent interphase."
https://openalex.org/W2560662711,"Flatfish have the most extreme asymmetric body morphology of vertebrates. During metamorphosis, one eye migrates to the contralateral side of the skull, and this migration is accompanied by extensive craniofacial transformations and simultaneous development of lopsided body pigmentation. The evolution of this developmental and physiological innovation remains enigmatic. Comparative genomics of two flatfish and transcriptomic analyses during metamorphosis point to a role for thyroid hormone and retinoic acid signaling, as well as phototransduction pathways. We demonstrate that retinoic acid is critical in establishing asymmetric pigmentation and, via cross-talk with thyroid hormones, in modulating eye migration. The unexpected expression of the visual opsins from the phototransduction pathway in the skin translates illumination differences and generates retinoic acid gradients that underlie the generation of asymmetry. Identifying the genetic underpinning of this unique developmental process answers long-standing questions about the evolutionary origin of asymmetry, but it also provides insight into the mechanisms that control body shape in vertebrates."

Their challenges have been observed and recognized at local and regional scales, yet there are no global-scale analyses to inform international policies. We compile available data for over 1,900 coastal Indigenous communities around the world representing 27 million people across 87 countries. Based on available data at local and regional levels, we estimate a total global yearly seafood consumption of 2.1 million (1.5 million-2.8 million) metric tonnes by coastal Indigenous peoples, equal to around 2% of global yearly commercial fisheries catch. Results reflect the crucial role of seafood for these communities; on average, consumption per capita is 15 times higher than non-Indigenous country populations. These findings contribute to an urgently needed sense of scale to coastal Indigenous issues, and will hopefully prompt increased recognition and directed research regarding the marine knowledge and resource needs of Indigenous peoples. Marine resources are crucial to the continued existence of coastal Indigenous peoples, and their needs must be explicitly incorporated into management policies."

Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) show distinct neurobehavioral deficits, characterized by impairments in social interactions, deficits in communication, as well as repetitive behaviors (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013Jiang Y.H.

ASDs are also characterized by wide sensory abnormalities related to touch, smell, taste, and pain (Allely, 2013Allely C.S.

Environmental factors, including pesticides and fungicides have been linked to autism and neurodegeneration (Lord et al., 2000Lord C. Cook E.H. Leventhal B.L. Amaral D.G.

As many as 70% of ASD patients show self-injurious behaviors, including head banging, skin picking, and self-biting (Furniss and Biswas, 2012Furniss F. Biswas A.B.

It was argued that ASD children have deficits in facial and behavioral expression of pain, which may lead caregivers to interpret this as pain insensitivity (Allely, 2013Allely C.S. Pain sensitivity and observer perception of pain in individuals with autistic spectrum disorder.Sci. World J. 2013; 2013: 916178Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This discrepancy results from our poor understanding of mechanisms underlying pain dysregulation in ASD. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that dysfunction of peripheral mechanosensory neurons contributes to tactile and behavioral deficits in mouse models of ASDs (Orefice et al., 2016Orefice L.L. Zimmerman A.L. Chirila A.M. Sleboda S.J. Head J.P. Ginty D.D.

Numerous genes have been implicated in ASDs including those that regulate synaptic transmission (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013Jiang Y.H. Ehlers M.D. Modeling autism by SHANK gene mutations in mice.Neuron. 2013; 78: 8-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). SHANK/ProSAP family proteins act as synaptic scaffolding proteins at postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory glutamatergic synapses (Sheng and Kim, 2000Sheng M. Kim E. The Shank family of scaffold proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human genetic evidence indicates that SHANK family genes are strong causative genes for idiopathic ASDs. SHANK3 is one of the best implicated genes in ASDs, and SHANK3 mutations were found in ∼2% of ASDs (Leblond et al., 2014Leblond C.S. Nava C. Polge A. Gauthier J. Huguet G. Lumbroso S. Giuliano F.

SHANK3 maps to the critical chromosome region of 22q13.3. Strikingly, clinical and genetic evaluation of 201 patients with Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) (Phelan et al., 2001Phelan M.C. Rogers R.C.

Genet. 2014; 133: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Different lines of Shank3 mutant mice, with deletions or mutations in different exons (exons 4–7, 9, 11, 13–16, and 21), have been reported. However, these lines of Shank3 mutant mice show variable molecular, synaptic, and behavioral phenotypes, in part due to different manipulations of Shank3 isoforms (Jiang and Ehlers, 2013Jiang Y.H. Ehlers M.D. Modeling autism by SHANK gene mutations in mice.Neuron. 2013; 78: 8-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To develop a more relevant ASD model, we generated Shank3 complete deficient mice by deleting exons 4 to 22. This deletion causes the absence of the entire SHANK3 protein coding sequence (Wang et al., 2016Wang X. Bey A.L. Katz B.M. Badea A. Kim N. David L.K. Duffney L.J. Kumar S. Mague S.D. Hulbert S.W. et al.Altered mGluR5-Homer scaffolds and corticostriatal connectivity in a Shank3 complete knockout model of autism.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Shank3Δe4–22 mouse has high construct validity because the deletion of Shank3 in mice closely mimics the SHANK3 defects found in most patients with ASDs. Notably, Shank3Δe4–22 mice demonstrate robust behavioral phenotypes that recapitulate the major features in SHANK3-related ASD and PMS and highlight postsynaptic modulation of this gene in brain regions such as striatum (Wang et al., 2016Wang X. Bey A.L. Katz B.M. Badea A. Kim N. David L.K. Duffney L.J. Kumar S. Mague S.D. Hulbert S.W. et al.Altered mGluR5-Homer scaffolds and corticostriatal connectivity in a Shank3 complete knockout model of autism.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated how SHANK3 regulates pain sensitivity in Shank3Δe4–22 mice. Specifically, we examined the role of SHANK3 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) primary sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. We also examined SHANK3 expression in presynaptic sites in spinal cord central terminals of DRG neurons. We have revealed a peripheral and presynaptic role of SHANK3 in pain transduction and transmission via regulating transient receptor potential ion channel subtype V1 (TRPV1). Our data have also demonstrated that haploinsufficiency of SHANK3 causes profound defects in TRPV1 function in mouse and human DRG neurons. To investigate a specific role of Shank3 in pain regulation, we tested baseline pain and inflammatory and neuropathic pain in Shank3 complete knockout mice, in which exons 4 to 22 were deleted (Figure 1A). In this study, we referred to Δe4–22−/− mice as Shank3−/− mice. We first compared the baseline thermal and mechanical sensitivity in homozygous (Shank3−/−), heterozygous (Shank3+/−), and wild-type (WT) mice. The hot plate test indicated that Shank3−/− mice exhibited no change in withdrawal latency at different temperatures (50°C, 53°C, and 56°C), compared to Shank3+/− and WT mice (Figure 1B). The von Frey test also showed no difference among three genotypes in paw withdrawal threshold to punctate mechanical stimuli (Figure 1C). Similarly, the cold sensitivity in cold plate and temperature preference test was unaltered in Shank3+/− and Shank3−/− mice (Figures 1D and S1A). Furthermore, the Hargreaves test showed intact response to radiant heat in Shank3−/− mice (Figure 1E). Together, these data suggest that baseline pain sensitivity, i.e., normal pain perception and temperature sensation do not change in Shank3 global knockout (KO) mice. Next, we investigated whether chronic pain is altered in Shank3 mutant mice. Intraplantar injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) induced persistent inflammatory pain for >1 week, as characterized by heat hyperalgesia (Figure 1E). This heat hyperalgesia was significantly impaired in both Shank3+/− mice and Shank3−/− mice (F2, 60 = 34.4790, p < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA; Figure 1E). There was also significant difference between homozygous and heterozygous mice (F1, 40 = 7.7231, p = 0.0083, two-way ANOVA; Figure 1E). This result indicates that loss of one copy of Shank3 is sufficient to cause pain defects, which is reminiscent of autism patients with haploinsufficiency mutations of SHANK3. However, CFA-induced edema was normal in KO mice (Figure S1B), suggesting that inflammatory pain defect was not a result of impaired inflammation. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) also produced long-lasting heat hyperalgesia (>4 weeks; Figure 1F). This neuropathic pain symptom was reduced in both Shank3−/− and Shank3+/− mice (Figure 1F). Inflammatory and neuropathic pain is also characterized by mechanical allodynia, a reduction in the paw withdrawal threshold in the von Frey test. Shank3+/− and Shank3−/− mice displayed a mild, but significant reduction in mechanical allodynia after CFA (F2, 72 = 6.9008, p = 0.0018, two-way ANOVA) and CCI (F2, 90 = 7.5570, p = 0.0009, two-way ANOVA) (Figures S1C and S1D). In contrast, the acetone test showed that nerve injury-induced cold allodynia was unaltered in Shank3 mutant mice (Figure S1E). Given a substantial reduction in heat hyperalgesia in Shank3 mutant mice, we postulated that heat transduction in sensory neurons could be impaired in these mice. The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 is expressed in C-fiber nociceptive neurons and upregulated in DRG neurons after inflammation and nerve injury (Ji et al., 2002Ji R.R. Samad T.A. Jin S.X. Schmoll R.

Neurosci. 2015; 35: 8593-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We tested capsaicin-induced pain in WT and Shank3 mutant mice. Intraplantar injection of capsaicin (10 μg) induced rapid (1–5 min) spontaneous pain (licking and flinching behavior) in WT mice, but this spontaneous pain was compromised in Shank3−/− and Shank3+/− mice (Figure 1G). Intraplantar capsaicin also resulted in neurogenic inflammation (paw edema), showing increased plasma extravasation in hindpaw tissue in the Evans Blue test (Figure 1H). The capsaicin-evoked plasma extravasation was reduced in Shank3−/− and Shank3+/− mice (Figure 1H). Interestingly, heterozygous and homozygous mice displayed similar defects in capsaicin responses (Figures 1G and 1H). Thus, Shank3 mutant mice have defects in both inflammation- and nerve injury-induced heat hyperalgesia due to compromised TRPV1 signaling. To determine if there is sensory neuron loss in mutant mice, we quantified the number of Nissl-stained neurons from every fifth DRG section of WT and Shank3−/− mice, but did not see significant loss of DRG neurons in Shank3−/− mice (1,756 ± 191 in WT DRGs versus 1,821.7 ± 181 in Shank3−/− DRGs, p > 0.05; Figure S2A). The percentages of TRPV1+, CGRP+, IB4+, and NF200+ neurons in Shank3−/− mice were unaltered (Figure S2A). Skin innervation of PGP9.5+ nerve fibers and spinal cord innervations of CGRP+, IB4+, and NF200+ axonal terminals were also normal in KO mice (Figures S2B and S2C). Neither did we see neuronal loss in the spinal cord (Figure S2D). Together, we conclude that the deficit of heat hyperalgesia in Shank3 mutant mice is not due to cell loss and innervation deficits of DRG neurons. We employed several different approaches to examine SHANK3 expression in DRG primary sensory neurons. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of all the Shank3 isoforms including Shank3a, Shank3b, Shank3c, Shank3d, and Shank3e in DRG, as well as spinal cord, cerebellum, and cortex tissues (Figure 2A). Western blotting showed SHANK3 protein expression in DRG and spinal cord of WT mice not Shank3−/− mice, with lower expression levels compared with that of cerebellum and cortex (Figure 2B). We also examined the expression of different Shank3 isoforms in DRGs after CFA-induced inflammation and nerve injury (CCI), but did not find any upregulations of these isoforms, despite a moderate downregulation in Shank3 isoforms (Figure S1F). It is likely that pain-induced neuronal activity may cause the downregulation, because neuronal activity has been shown to downregulate Shank3 isoforms in cortical neurons (Wang et al., 2014bWang X. Xu Q. Bey A.L. Lee Y. Jiang Y.H. Transcriptional and functional complexity of Shank3 provides a molecular framework to understand the phenotypic heterogeneity of SHANK3 causing autism and Shank3 mutant mice.Mol. Autism. 2014; 5: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry revealed that SHANK3 immunoreactivity (IR) is widely expressed in mouse DRG neurons, but SHANK3-IR in DRGs was lost in Shank3−/− mice (Figure 2C). Double staining showed that SHANK3-IR was highly expressed in small-sized peptidergic (substance P+) and non-peptidergic (IB4+) neurons, as well as in large-sized myelinated neurons (NF200+) in mouse DRG (Figure 2D). Cell size distribution analysis showed broad expression of SHANK3 in DRG neurons of different sizes, with predominant expression in small-sized neurons (<600 μm2; Figure 2E). We also observed SHANK3-IR in nerve fibers in the hindpaw glabrous skin, due to axonal transport of SHANK3 from DRG cell bodies to peripheral terminals (Figure S3A). In situ hybridization also showed wide expression of Shank3 mRNA in DRG neurons of WT mice, but not Shank3−/− mice (Figure S3B). As in mouse DRG neurons, SHANK3 was widely expressed in rat DRG neurons too (Figures S3C and S3D). Dense SHANK3-IR was also found in the spinal cord dorsal horn, especially in the superficial layers (laminae I–III) of WT mice, but not in KO mice (Figures 2F and S3E). As in DRG neurons, SHANK3-IR is present in both peptidergic (SP+) and non-peptidergic (IB4+) axonal terminals in the superficial dorsal horn (Figures 2F, S3E, and S3F). Interestingly, ablation of TRPV1-expressing C-fibers with systemic treatment of the neurotoxin resiniferatoxin (RTX) completely blocked the heat pain (Liu et al., 2010Liu T. Xu Z.Z. Park C.K. Berta T. Ji R.R. Toll-like receptor 7 mediates pruritus.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 1460-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and significantly reduced SHANK3-IR in the laminae I and IIo (Figures 2F and 2G). This result strongly suggests that SHANK3 in the superficial dorsal horn is originated, at least partly, from primary afferents. As expected, SHANK3-IR was also observed in many neurons in the deep dorsal horn (Figure S3E). Therefore, SHANK3 is expressed at both presynaptic sites (primary afferent terminals) and postsynaptic sites (neuronal somata) in the spinal cord dorsal horn. To determine the molecular and neural mechanism by which SHANK3 regulates pain, we employed patch-clamp recordings to assess TRPV1 function in dissociated small-diameter (<25 μm) DRG neurons of WT, Shank3+/− and Shank3−/− mice. Remarkably, inward currents induced by 100 nM capsaicin were substantially reduced in heterozygous mice and almost abolished in homozygous mice (Figures 3A and 3B ). The percentage of DRG neurons responding to 100 nM capsaicin decreased from 55% (12/22) in WT mice to 30% (18/33 and 10/31) in Shank3+/− and Shank3−/− mice, respectively. Inward currents induced by a high dose of capsaicin (1 μM) were also drastically reduced in Shank3+/− and Shank3−/− mice (Figure 3B). In parallel, capsaicin-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase was also reduced in Shank3-deficient neurons (Figures S4A and S4B). Interestingly, the TRPV1 defects in homozygous and heterozygous mice were comparable, and no statistic difference was found between these two genotypes (Figures 3A and 3B), indicating that haploinsufficiency of Shank3 is sufficient to disrupt TRPV1 function. Human genetics strongly suggests that SCN9A, the gene encoding sodium channel subunit Nav1.7, critically regulates pain sensitivity (Cox et al., 2006Cox J.J. Reimann F. Nicholas A.K. Thornton G. Roberts E. Springell K. Karbani G. Jafri H. Mannan J. Raashid Y. et al.An SCN9A channelopathy causes congenital inability to experience pain.Nature. 2006; 444: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, Raouf et al., 2010Raouf R. Quick K. Wood J.N. Pain as a channelopathy.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 3745-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transient sodium currents, as well as Nav1.7-mediated sodium currents (isolated by Protoxin-II) (Sokolov et al., 2008Sokolov S. Kraus R.L. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Inhibition of sodium channel gating by trapping the domain II voltage sensor with protoxin II.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 1020-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were normal in Shank3-deficient DRG neurons compared with WT neurons (Figure 3C). Neither did we find changes in neuronal excitability in Shank3−/− mice: Shank3-deficient neurons and WT neurons fired action potentials at the same rate (Figure 3D). Thus, sodium channels such as Nav1.7 may not contribute to pain defects in Shank3−/− mice. To rescue TRPV1 deficiency in Shank3-deficient neurons, we re-expressed Shank3 in these deficient mouse DRG neurons through electroporation of Shank3a construct. Notably, overexpressing Shank3-gfp in Shank3-deficient DRG neurons increased TRPV1 currents to the levels of WT neurons (Figure 3E). Thus, mouse Shank3 gene is critical for the function of TRPV1 in primary sensory neurons. Human SHANK3 mutation with a guanine insertion in exon 21 (InsG3680) is strongly associated with ASD (Durand et al., 2007Durand C.M. Betancur C. Boeckers T.M. Bockmann J. Chaste P. Fauchereau F. Nygren G. Rastam M. Gillberg I.C. Anckarsäter H. et al.Mutations in the gene encoding the synaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 are associated with autism spectrum disorders.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). Overexpressing this SHANK3 mutant in Shank3-deficient DRG neurons failed to completely rescue TRPV1 currents (Figure 3E), despite higher expression of this mutant than WT Shank3 in DRG cultures after the transfection (Figure S4C). This result suggests an active role of SHANK3 mutation in regulating the TRPV1 function. TRPV1 in central terminals of nociceptors regulates glutamate release from presynaptic terminals (Park et al., 2011Park C.K. Lü N. Xu Z.Z. Liu T. Serhan C.N. Ji R.R. Resolving TRPV1- and TNF-α-mediated spinal cord synaptic plasticity and inflammatory pain with neuroprotectin D1.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 15072-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Next, we tested basal and capsaicin-evoked excitatory synaptic transmission in spinal cord slices of WT and Shank3−/− mice, by recording miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in lamina IIo neurons. These interneurons are predominantly excitatory, receive input from TRPV1-expressing primary afferents, and send output to lamina I projection neurons (Park et al., 2011Park C.K. Lü N. Xu Z.Z. Liu T. Serhan C.N. Ji R.R. Resolving TRPV1- and TNF-α-mediated spinal cord synaptic plasticity and inflammatory pain with neuroprotectin D1.J.

Neurosci. 2010; 11: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). We found normal mEPSCs in Shank3-deficient lamina IIo neurons: both the frequency and amplitude of mEPSC were comparable in WT and Shank3−/− mice (Figures 3F, 3G, S4D, and S4E). Capsaicin produced dose-dependent increases in mEPSC frequency, but not mEPSC amplitude in WT mice; but these mEPSC frequency increases were substantially reduced after Shank3 deficiency (Figures 3F and 3G). Thus, SHANK3 is also required for TRPV1-mediated synaptic plasticity (mEPSC frequency increase) via presynaptic modulation. Given an important role of TRPM8 in cold sensation (Bautista et al., 2007Bautista D.M. Siemens J. Glazer J.M. Tsuruda P.R. Basbaum A.I. Stucky C.L. Jordt S.E. Julius D. The menthol receptor TRPM8 is the principal detector of environmental cold.Nature. 2007; 448: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), we tested the function of TRPM8 in DRG and spinal cord neurons in WT and Shank3−/− mice. Menthol induced comparable increases in intracellular Ca2+ in DRG neurons and mEPSC in spinal lamina IIo neurons of WT and Shank3−/− mice (Figures S4F–S4H), suggesting an intact TRPM8 signaling after Shank3 deficiency. TRPC4 is expressed in DRG neurons and regulated in neuropathic pain (Staaf et al., 2009Staaf S. Oerther S. Lucas G. Mattsson J.P. Ernfors P. Differential regulation of TRP channels in a rat model of neuropathic pain.Pain. 2009; 144: 187-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Gadolinium chloride (GdCl3), an agonist of TRPC4, induced comparable inward currents in DRG neurons and mEPSC frequency increases in spinal cord neurons in WT and Shank3 KO mice (Figures S4I–S4K), suggesting that TRPC4 function does not require SHANK3. Spinal capsaicin injection via intrathecal (i.t.) route induces robust spontaneous pain via central TRPV1 at primary afferent terminals (Park et al., 2011Park C.K. Lü N. Xu Z.Z. Liu T. Serhan C.N. Ji R.R. Resolving TRPV1- and TNF-α-mediated spinal cord synaptic plasticity and inflammatory pain with neuroprotectin D1.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 15072-15085Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This spontaneous pain was reduced in both Shank3+/− and Shank3−/− mice (Figure 3H). Capsaicin also elicited phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) in superficial dorsal horn neurons, an essential step for central sensitization in persistent pain (Ji et al., 2003Ji R.R. Kohno T. Moore K.A. Woolf C.J. Central sensitization and LTP: do pain and memory share similar mechanisms?.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 696-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). The capsaicin-induced pERK was abolished in Shank3−/− mice (Figure S5). Thus, Shank3 is also important for central TRPV1 signaling in the spinal cord. Our behavioral and electrophysiological data support a functional interaction of SHANK3 and TRPV1. We further examined biochemical interactions between these two important proteins. Double staining revealed co-localization of TRPV1 with SHANK3 in mouse DRG neurons (Figure 4A). TRPV1 is also co-localized with SHANK3 in spinal axonal terminals in the superficial dorsal horn (Figure 4B). The co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) experiment showed possible in"
https://openalex.org/W2558230882,"Making decisions in uncertain environments often requires combining multiple pieces of ambiguous information from external cues. In such conditions, human choices resemble optimal Bayesian inference, but typically show a large suboptimal variability whose origin remains poorly understood. In particular, this choice suboptimality might arise from imperfections in mental inference rather than in peripheral stages, such as sensory processing and response selection. Here, we dissociate these three sources of suboptimality in human choices based on combining multiple ambiguous cues. Using a novel quantitative approach for identifying the origin and structure of choice variability, we show that imperfections in inference alone cause a dominant fraction of suboptimal choices. Furthermore, two-thirds of this suboptimality appear to derive from the limited precision of neural computations implementing inference rather than from systematic deviations from Bayes-optimal inference. These findings set an upper bound on the accuracy and ultimate predictability of human choices in uncertain environments."

However, the cellular origins and mechanistic roles of field potential dynamics in brain function generally remain unclear (Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011Kajikawa Y. Schroeder C.E.

The biological challenges to dissecting these dynamics are at least twofold. First, field potentials typically reflect contributions from multiple cell types, some of which may be anatomically sparse. Second, they generally reflect a time-varying, unknown mixture of signal sources across multiple length scales, from local currents generated within ∼100 μm to volume-conducted signals coming ∼1 cm away from the recording probe (Buzsáki et al., 2012Buzsáki G.

This complexity has hindered biological interpretations of electric field oscillations, especially in areas that lack laminar structure and have multiple intermingled neuron types. Laminar brain areas allow charge source density analyses of the electrical sources in different laminae, but such approaches are far less informative in non-laminar areas (Buzsáki et al., 2012Buzsáki G.

Further, the extant means of recording cells’ trans-membrane voltages have not allowed studies of defined cell types in behaving animals. Intracellular electrode recordings are usually restricted to single cells, are nearly prohibitive in behaving animals, and are not easily targeted to specific cell types, especially in sub-cortical tissues. Genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators work well in behaving animals (Cui et al., 2013Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Pham M.D. Vogel S.S. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M.

By comparison, fluorescent indicators of trans-membrane voltage report subthreshold and inhibitory activity (Akemann et al., 2010Akemann W. Mutoh H. Perron A. Rossier J. Knöpfel T.

However, genetically encoded voltage sensors have modest dynamic ranges, ∼1% signal change per 10 mV voltage change in cultured cells and even less for signals averaged over a cell population. These small signals are comparable to fluorescence fluctuations that arise in vivo from hemodynamics and brain motion (Akemann et al., 2012Akemann W. Mutoh H. Perron A. Park Y.K. Iwamoto Y.

Identification of optical voltage signals from identified cell populations has thus required averaging over multiple experimental trials, use of less-sensitive dual-color indicators, or illumination levels that cause rapid photobleaching and limit recordings from tens to hundreds of seconds (Akemann et al., 2012Akemann W.

To date, no system for optical voltage recording has had the sensitivity to monitor identified cell types in freely behaving animals nor to approach the physical sensitivity limits set by quantum mechanical photon shot noise (Hamel et al., 2015Hamel E.J.

Here, we report a fiber-optic method for recording the voltage dynamics of genetically specified cells in active mice. Unlike past approaches (Akemann et al., 2010Akemann W. Mutoh H. Perron A. Rossier J. Knöpfel T. Imaging brain electric signals with genetically targeted voltage-sensitive fluorescent proteins.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, Ferezou et al., 2006Ferezou I. Bolea S. Petersen C.C.

To stress that our method senses trans-membrane and not extracellular voltages, we named it “trans-membrane electrical measurements performed optically” (TEMPO). TEMPO removes physiologically induced noise fluctuations, is ∼10-fold more sensitive than fiber-optic methods for Ca2+ sensing (Gunaydin et al., 2014Gunaydin L.A. Grosenick L. Finkelstein J.C.

This measurement sensitivity lowers the illumination needed, allowing recordings up to ∼1 hr long. We validated TEMPO by studying cortical and hippocampal oscillations in the delta, theta, and gamma frequency bands in active mice. To illustrate TEMPO’s utility in cell types poorly studied with field potential recordings, we examined D1- and D2-dopamine-receptor-expressing striatal medium spiny neurons (D1 and D2 MSNs) in freely behaving mice. It is has been infeasible to distinguish these two MSN types based on their electrical activity or to isolate their contributions to the striatal local field potential (LFP). TEMPO revealed two distinct voltage waveforms—one a temporally isolated transient and the other a short-lived oscillation in both D1 and D2 MSNs, which were mutually synchronized during each of these. TEMPO also showed that MSNs hyperpolarize during these events and provided higher detection fidelity than electric field recordings, which generally did not reveal the isolated transients. Antagonism of D1 or D2 receptors evoked the two types of events to different extents, indicating direct links between dopamine signaling imbalances and abnormal levels of oscillation in striatal MSNs. TEMPO’s ability to connect specific cell types with macroscopic electrophysiological phenomena offers new means to dissect neurophysiologic states into their cellular constituents. TEMPO has four key elements that jointly allow optical voltage sensing at the physical sensitivity limits while minimizing the impact of optical artifacts (Figure 1). First, to track concurrently neural voltage dynamics and physiologically induced artifacts, we co-expressed a green voltage sensor that undergoes approximately linear changes in fluorescence intensity as a function of trans-membrane voltage (MacQ-mCitrine or Ace2N-4AA-mNeon) (Gong et al., 2014Gong Y.

High-speed recording of neural spikes in awake mice and flies with a fluorescent voltage sensor.Science. 2015; 350: 1361-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and a red reference fluor that we used to track optical fluctuations due to hemodynamics and brain motion (mCherry or tdTomato). This approach was based on studies in which we co-expressed static green and red fluors to assess the fluctuations alone. Despite the wavelength differences, the red and green fluctuations correlated strongly (Figure S1), showing that one can use the detected emissions of a red reference fluor to remove artifacts in recordings with a green voltage sensor. Second, to remove crosstalk arising from spectral overlap of the emissions, we sinusoidally modulated the intensities of the two excitation lasers (488 and 561 nm wavelengths); the modulations of the two beams were 90° out of phase but at the same frequency (either 0.9 or 3.5 kHz) (STAR Methods). This allowed us to separate the signals excited by the two lasers via their distinct modulation signatures. We used four lock-in amplifiers, each phase locked to the laser modulation, to amplify detected signals and track laser power fluctuations. This shifted the detection band away from low frequencies at which detectors usually have greater electronic noise and allowed near-uniform sensitivity across a 1–50 Hz recording bandwidth (Figure S2). Third, to deliver two colors of illumination to the brain and collect the resulting fluorescence, we chose two single-mode lasers and a multimode optical fiber, with the aim of minimizing auto-fluorescence. The fiber core diameter matched that of the incoming beams to minimize coupling of illumination into fiber-optic cladding modes. Light in the cladding leaks into the fiber-optic coating where it can excite substantial auto-fluorescence (Vo-Dinh, 2015Vo-Dinh T. Biomedical photonics handbook.Second Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton2015Google Scholar), a well-known challenge for fluorescence-sensing studies that can necessitate separate fibers for illumination and signal collection (Cui et al., 2013Cui G. Jun S.B. Jin X. Pham M.D. Vogel S.S. Lovinger D.M. Costa R.M. Concurrent activation of striatal direct and indirect pathways during action initiation.Nature. 2013; 494: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Fourth, to isolate voltage-dependent signals from physiological artifacts in the detected traces, we used a custom blind-source separation algorithm (Figures 1C and 2A and Appendix 1 in Data S1). Prior attempts to unmix these in voltage-imaging studies with head-fixed rodents used a principal component analysis (PCA) (Akemann et al., 2012Akemann W. Mutoh H. Perron A. Park Y.K. Iwamoto Y. Knöpfel T. Imaging neural circuit dynamics with a voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 108: 2323-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, Carandini et al., 2015Carandini M. Shimaoka D. Rossi L.F. Sato T.K. Benucci A. Knöpfel T. Imaging the awake visual cortex with a genetically encoded voltage indicator.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). PCA was ineffective in our studies and did not isolate the signals (Figure S3). This is unsurprising, as PCA is not designed to separate independent signal sources. Instead, we developed a two-stage unmixing algorithm. Stage one estimates the time-dependent, cardiovascular pulsations in the red emission channel. Stage two uses independent component analysis (ICA), an established algorithm for source separation, to extract a decontaminated voltage trace (Figures 2A and S3).Figure 2Blind Source Separation Allows Near Shot-Noise-Limited Measurement SensitivityShow full caption(A) Blind source separation procedure.

See also Figure S3 and Appendix 2 in Data S1. Exploratory studies in control mice expressing mCherry and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) revealed low-frequency fluctuations (<10 Hz), likely due to motion- and breathing-induced artifacts, which we expected would corrupt both color channels similarly. There was also a noise peak (∼12 Hz) from cardiac pulsations (Figure 2B) (Kalatsky and Stryker, 2003Kalatsky V.A. Stryker M.P. New paradigm for optical imaging: temporally encoded maps of intrinsic signal.Neuron. 2003; 38: 529-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), which, due to the wavelength-dependence of light absorption by hemoglobin, we expected would impact the two channels differently. Indeed, YFP/mCherry recordings showed that a time-invariant unmixing approach generally did not reduce fluctuations to the minimum set by shot noise. This spurred us to use two-stage unmixing to explicitly account for the differential effects of cardiovascular fluctuations on the red and green channels. To evaluate how well this algorithm improved TEMPO’s sensitivity, we applied it to the YFP/mCherry datasets and achieved a ∼10-fold decline in the integrated spectral power of physiological artifacts compared to the raw YFP emissions trace (Figures 2B and 2C). The power spectrum of the unmixed trace was nearly flat across 0–50 Hz, showing that unmixing reduced both cardiovascular and brain motion artifacts. The distribution of fluctuation amplitudes in the unmixed data approached that of a shot-noise limited recording (Figures 2C and S2), showing that TEMPO was operating at the sensitivity limits. As with control mice, for mice expressing MacQ-mCitrine and mCherry, our algorithm reduced the power of cardiac-induced noise by ∼10-fold (Figure 2D). Overall, TEMPO has ∼10-fold greater optical sensitivity than prior fiber-optic recording approaches not using a reference channel or unmixing scheme. As the unmixed voltage trace has shot noise from both color channels, both the reference and indicator fluors play key roles in noise removal (Appendices 1 and 2 in Data S1). Thus, one should minimize shot noise in the reference channel by brightly expressing the red fluor. Notably, the bright red fluor tdTomato contributed lower-amplitude fluctuations to our unmixed traces than the dimmer fluor mCherry (mean ± SEM power spectral density of shot noise in six tdTomato mice was –90 ± 2 dB versus –81 ± 2 dB in 12 mCherry mice; p = 0.005; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). As a validation, we verified that TEMPO can track voltage rhythms in laminar tissue, where field recordings have long been fruitful. We studied somatosensory cortex in mice anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine, which induces low-frequency cortical oscillations. We virally expressed mCherry and MacQ-mCitrine in pyramidal cells (cortical layers 5 and 6) and performed simultaneous TEMPO, EEG, and LFP recordings, with the LFP electrode tip 50–150 μm from the tip of the optical fiber (Figures 3A and 3B ). The EEG and TEMPO traces exhibited delta rhythms with a consistent phase offset (EEG frequency: 1.3 ± 0.1 Hz; TEMPO: 1.25 ± 0.15 Hz; mean offset between TEMPO and EEG rhythms: 1.4° ± 0.6°; mean ± SEM; n = 4 mice; Figures 3C and 3D). In EEG, but not TEMPO traces, YFP/mCherry mice had similar rhythms as the MacQ-mCitrine/mCherry mice (Figure S1). Thus, the detection of oscillations by TEMPO required expression of the voltage indicator and was not merely due to physiologic artifacts or noise. A key constraint of EEG and LFP recordings is the inability to selectively track anatomically sparse cell types. To show that TEMPO has no such constraint, we studied cortical parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, a relatively sparse class of inhibitory cells (Hu et al., 2014Hu H. Gan J. Jonas P. Interneurons. Fast-spiking, parvalbumin+ GABAergic interneurons: from cellular design to microcircuit function.Science. 2014; 345: 1255263Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). We co-injected PV-Cre mice with AAV2/5-CAG-DIO-MacQ-mCitrine and AAV2/5-CaMK2a-mCherry. Fluorescent PV cells were in cortical layers 2/3–5/6, matching their known distribution (Figure S4). In anesthetized mice, 1–3 Hz delta rhythms arose in both the EEG and TEMPO traces (EEG frequency: 1.2 ± 0.04 Hz; TEMPO frequency in PV cells: 1.2 ± 0.1 Hz; mean ± SEM; n = 3 mice) (Figure 3E). We compared phase offsets between the delta rhythms in PV cells to those in pyramidal cells of layers 5 and 6. We aligned the TEMPO traces to moments of a switch from a hyperpolarized to a depolarized state, noting that emission declines from MacQ-mCitrine report depolarizations and rises report hyperpolarizations (Gong et al., 2014Gong Y. Wagner M.J. Zhong Li J. Schnitzer M.J. Imaging neural spiking in brain tissue using FRET-opsin protein voltage sensors.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). At these transitions, LFP traces showed negative-going voltage spikes but with distinct temporal offsets from the transitions seen by TEMPO in the two cell types (Figure 3F) (mean ± SEM offsets between LFP voltage minima and TEMPO zero-crossings: 23 ± 2 ms [pyramidal] versus –4 ± 10 ms [PV]; phase offsets: 11° ± 1° (pyramidal) versus –10° ± 7° [PV]; both p < 10−5; Wilcoxon rank-sum test; n = 2264 transitions [pyramidal; n = 4 mice] versus 128 [PV; n = 3 mice]). This fits with past reports of coordinated switching between hyperpolarization and depolarization in pyramidal cell and interneuron populations but with a briefer delay to spiking upon depolarization in many interneurons (Massi et al., 2012Massi L. Lagler M. Hartwich K. Borhegyi Z. Somogyi P. Klausberger T. Temporal dynamics of parvalbumin-expressing axo-axonic and basket cells in the rat medial prefrontal cortex in vivo.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 16496-16502Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To examine high-frequency rhythms, we studied pyramidal cells in somatosensory cortex of awake head-fixed mice and used the voltage sensor Ace2N-4AA-mNeon, which has fast (< 1 ms) kinetics (Gong et al., 2015Gong Y. Huang C. Li J.Z. Grewe B.F. Zhang Y. Eismann S. Schnitzer M.J.

Consistent with past work, during tactile stimulation of the face there was a transient (∼100–200 ms) rise in both TEMPO and LFP gamma-band (20–80 Hz) power (33 ± 7 Hz [TEMPO]; 37 ± 3 Hz [LFP]; mean frequency ± SEM over trials) (Haider and McCormick, 2009Haider B.

Here, we find that histone H2AX displays oncogenic activity by serving as a crucial regulator of HIF1α signalling. H2AX interacts with HIF1α to prevent its degradation and nuclear export in order to allow successful VHL-independent HIF1α transcriptional activation. We show that mono-ubiquitylation and phosphorylation of H2AX, which are strictly mediated by hypoxia-induced E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 and ATM, critically regulate HIF1α-driven tumorigenesis. Importantly, TRAF6 and γH2AX are overexpressed in human breast cancer, correlate with activation of HIF1α signalling, and predict metastatic outcome. Thus, TRAF6 and H2AX overexpression and γH2AX-mediated HIF1α enrichment in the nucleus of cancer cells lead to overactivation of HIF1α-driven tumorigenesis, glycolysis and metastasis. Our findings suggest that TRAF6-mediated mono-ubiquitylation and subsequent phosphorylation of H2AX may serve as potential means for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Lin and colleagues report that hypoxia induces TRAF6-dependent mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2AX, which promotes binding and stabilization of HIF1α. Activated HIF1α signalling in turn promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2560809971,"Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of neonatal death worldwide. Intrauterine and systemic infection and inflammation cause 30-40% of spontaneous preterm labor (PTL), which precedes PTB. Although antibody production is a major immune defense mechanism against infection, and B cell dysfunction has been implicated in pregnancy complications associated with PTL, the functions of B cells in pregnancy are not well known. We found that choriodecidua of women undergoing spontaneous PTL harbored functionally altered B cell populations. B cell-deficient mice were markedly more susceptible than wild-type (WT) mice to PTL after inflammation, but B cells conferred interleukin (IL)-10-independent protection against PTL. B cell deficiency in mice resulted in a lower uterine level of active progesterone-induced blocking factor 1 (PIBF1), and therapeutic administration of PIBF1 mitigated PTL and uterine inflammation in B cell-deficient mice. B cells are a significant producer of PIBF1 in human choriodecidua and mouse uterus in late gestation. PIBF1 expression by B cells is induced by the mucosal alarmin IL-33 (ref. 9). Human PTL was associated with diminished expression of the α-chain of IL-33 receptor on choriodecidual B cells and a lower level of active PIBF1 in late gestation choriodecidua. These results define a vital regulatory cascade involving IL-33, decidual B cells and PIBF1 in safeguarding term pregnancy and suggest new therapeutic approaches based on IL-33 and PIBF1 to prevent human PTL."

The NLRP3 inflammasome is an oligomeric innate immune intracellular signaling complex that senses many pathogen-, host-, and environment-derived factors (4Iwasaki A. Pillai P.S. Innate immunity to influenza virus infection.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Inflammasome-induced cytokine release requires two signals: up-regulation of components of the NLRP3 inflammasome and synthesis of pro-IL-1β through activation of the prototypic inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB and inflammasome formation that results in IL-1β maturation and secretion. Following activation, NLRP3 binds to the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). ASC further recruits the enzyme caspase-1 to form the inflammasome complex, initiating autocatalytic cleavage of caspase-1. The NLRP3 inflammasome is now recognized as a major route by which the innate immune system recognizes and responds during IAV infection (4Iwasaki A. Pillai P.S.

In these studies, inflammasome-deficient mice were highly susceptible to both low and high inoculum doses of PR8, and the NLRP3 inflammasome was shown to be required for production of pyrogenic IL-1β and IL-18 in the airways, cellular infiltration, and lung immunopathology. These findings suggested that NLRP3-induced responses were crucial to host protection via recruitment of effector cells and the induction of tissue repair. Additionally, a lack of the IL-1 receptor has been shown to increase mortality but reduce lung immunopathology following infection with PR8 H1N1 or avian H5N1, suggesting that IL-1 receptor signaling may increase damage to the lung (9Schmitz N. Kurrer M. Bachmann M.F. Kopf M. Interleukin-1 is responsible for acute lung immunopathology but increases survival of respiratory influenza virus infection.J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6441-6448Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 10Szretter K.J. Gangappa S. Lu X. Smith C. Shieh W.J. Zaki S.R. Sambhara S. Tumpey T.M. Katz J.M. Role of host cytokine responses in the pathogenesis of avian H5N1 influenza viruses in mice.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2736-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Critically, we recently identified that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays both a protective and detrimental role during pathogenic IAV challenge through temporal inhibition of NLRP3 function (11Tate M.D. Ong J.D. Dowling J.K. McAuley J.L. Robertson A.B. Latz E. Drummond G.R. Cooper M.A. Hertzog P.J. Mansell A. Reassessing the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome during pathogenic influenza A virus infection via temporal inhibition.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 27912Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This therefore suggests that excessive or prolonged NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to the hyperinflammatory phenotype associated with pathogenic infections. Fatal IAV infections correlate with production of excessive levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (termed a “cytokine storm”) and excessive cellular inflammation. PB1-F2 protein is encoded by a +1 alternate reading frame of the PB1 gene, and protein expression in cells has been linked to cell death, viral replication, and virulence, although these properties can differ between virus strains (12Krumbholz A. Philipps A. Oehring H. Schwarzer K. Eitner A. Wutzler P. Zell R. Current knowledge on PB1-F2 of influenza A viruses.Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 2011; 200: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Crucially, we have shown that PB1-F2 proteins derived from 20th century pandemic and highly pathogenic IAV strains, but not mildly virulent IAVs, activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, inducing IL-1β production and pulmonary inflammation (13McAuley J.L. Tate M.D. MacKenzie-Kludas C.J. Pinar A. Zeng W. Stutz A. Latz E. Brown L.E. Mansell A. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by IAV virulence protein PB1-F2 contributes to severe pathophysiology and disease.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003392Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). PB1-F2 triggers excessive cellular recruitment and hyperinflammatory responses in the lungs of infected mice (14McAuley J.L. Chipuk J.E. Boyd K.L. Van De Velde N. Green D.R. McCullers J.A. PB1-F2 proteins from H5N1 and 20 century pandemic influenza viruses cause immunopathology.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1001014Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 15McAuley J.L. Hornung F.

Expression of the 1918 influenza A virus PB1-F2 enhances the pathogenesis of viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia.Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 240-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Specific PB1-F2 amino acids that enhance inflammation and are linked to virulence have been identified at the C terminus and map to residues Leu-62, Arg-75, Arg-79, and Leu-82, termed the four inflammatory residues (16Alymova I.V. Green A.M. van de Velde N. McAuley J.L. Boyd K.L. Ghoneim H.E. McCullers J.A. Immunopathogenic and antibacterial effects of H3N2 influenza A virus PB1-F2 map to amino acid residues 62, 75, 79, and 82.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 12324-12333Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified that PB1-F2 from H7N9 is a potent activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. We also identified that inflammasome activation was related to PB1-F2-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and that targeting mtROS with the specific inhibitor MitoTempo inhibited PB1-F2 peptide-induced inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion and maturation. PB1-F2 peptide-mediated inflammasome activation and inflammation were phagocytosis-dependent and inhibited by the small-molecule NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 in vitro and in vivo. This study identifies H7N9 PB1-F2 as an activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome and suggests that PB1-F2 may contribute to the hyperinflammation associated with current human H7N9 infections. Our identification of MCC950 as a potent inhibitor of H7N9 PB1-F2-induced lung inflammation and cellular influx suggests that novel therapies that specifically target the NLRP3 inflammasome may therefore provide an effective treatment to reduce the mortality associated with pathogenic H7N9 IAV and offset the ineffectiveness of current antiviral treatments in the later stages of infection. We have previously demonstrated that aggregated PB1-F2 derived from the PR8 strain of IAV (H1N1) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, contributing to disease pathophysiology (13McAuley J.L. Tate M.D. MacKenzie-Kludas C.J. Pinar A. Zeng W. Stutz A. Latz E. Brown L.E. Mansell A. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by IAV virulence protein PB1-F2 contributes to severe pathophysiology and disease.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003392Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We examined the inflammatory potential of aggregated PB1-F2 derived from the recently identified novel avian-origin H7N9 IAV. Using aggregated peptides derived from the C termini of PB1-F2 from both PR8 and H7N9 (the latter being A/Shanghai/02/2013), we show that >85% of both peptides form similar concentrations of protein aggregates between 0.5 and 2.5 μm (supplemental Fig. 1, A–C), a particle size found previously to be optimal for NLRP3 inflammasome activation by other aggregates (17Hornung V. Bauernfeind F. Halle A. Samstad E.O. Kono H. Rock K.L. Fitzgerald K.A. Latz E. Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). To examine whether H7N9 PB1-F2 aggregated peptide could induce IL-1β secretion, we challenged LPS-primed WT immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophage (iBMDMs) from mice with H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide and analyzed IL-1β secretion by ELISA. We have previously demonstrated the requirement for LPS priming prior to PB1-F2 peptide challenge to induce up-regulation of inflammasome components, including pro-IL-1β and pro-caspase-1 (13McAuley J.L. Tate M.D. MacKenzie-Kludas C.J. Pinar A. Zeng W. Stutz A. Latz E. Brown L.E. Mansell A. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by IAV virulence protein PB1-F2 contributes to severe pathophysiology and disease.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003392Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 1A, H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide induced IL-1β secretion by macrophages in a dose-dependent manner, similar to that observed with PR8 PB1-F2. Furthermore, H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide corresponding to the sequence changes associated with crossover from avian to human (G70E and S77L) also induced IL-1β secretion, whereas substitution of the four critical amino acids associated with PB1-F2 inflammation with the equivalent non-inflammatory Wuhan sequence (L62P, R75H, R79Q, and L82S) was ineffective (supplemental Fig. S2A). H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide inflammasome activation was further validated by dose-dependent secretion of IL-1β in primary murine BMDMs challenged with H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide (supplemental Fig. 2B). We determined the ability of H7N9 PB1-F2 to induce caspase-1 cleavage into the p20 subunit and the subsequent processing of IL-1β to its mature form, p17, by immunoblotting. Wild-type primary BMDMs primed with LPS were challenged with either PR8- or H7N9-derived PB1-F2. H7N9 PB1-F2 induced proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B, top panel) with concomitant processing of IL-1β p17 (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). Caspase-1 p20 and IL-1β p17 were also detected following stimulation with PR8 PB1-F2 and silica (Fig. 1B, top and bottom panels, respectively). The uptake of infection- and disease-related protein aggregates by phagocytes and subsequent lysosomal destabilization are known triggers of inflammasome activation (17Hornung V. Bauernfeind F. Halle A. Samstad E.O. Kono H. Rock K.L. Fitzgerald K.A. Latz E. Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). In our experiments, inhibition of phagocytosis with latrunculin A, prevention of phagolysosomal maturation with bafilomycin A, and inhibition of caspase-1 activity with Z-YVAD reduced IL-1β secretion in a concentration-dependent manner in both iBMDMs and primary BMDMs stimulated with H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide (Fig. 1, C–E, and supplemental Fig. 2, C and D), respectively. To evaluate whether H7N9 derived PB1-F2 protein may also enhance inflammatory events in human cells, we examined cellular responses in LPS-primed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) exposed to H7N9 PB1-F2. H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide induced robust secretion of IL-1β from hPBMCs (Fig. 1F) (17Hornung V. Bauernfeind F. Halle A. Samstad E.O. Kono H. Rock K.L. Fitzgerald K.A. Latz E. Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar), which was inhibited via treatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD (Fig. 1G). Taken together, these data suggest that H7N9-derived PB1-F2 aggregate induces IL-1β secretion in murine macrophages and human PBMCs in manner that is dependent on phagocytosis and caspase-1 activity. We next confirmed that phagocytosis of H7N9 PB1-F2 is required for inflammasome activation or ASC speck formation by bioimaging. H7N9 PB1-F2 was labeled with the pH-sensitive dye pHrodo, which dramatically increases in fluorescence intensity in the acidic environment of the phagolysosomal compartment. NLRP3-deficient iBMDMs stably reconstituted with cerulean-tagged ASC and NLRP3-FLAG, which obviates the need for priming, were used to visualize inflammasome activation via speck formation. ASC-cerulean macrophages were challenged with labeled H7N9-pHrodo peptide, and ASC speck formation was visualized as a well characterized marker of inflammasome formation and activation of caspase-1 (18Franklin B.S. Bossaller L. De Nardo D. Ratter J.M. Stutz A. Engels G. Brenker C. Nordhoff M. Mirandola S.R. Al-Amoudi A. Mangan M.S. Zimmer S. Monks B.G. Fricke M. Schmidt R.E. et al.The adaptor ASC has extracellular and “prionoid” activities that propagate inflammation.Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15: 727-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). As observed in Fig. 2 and the live-cell imaging in supplemental Movies 1 and 2, pHrodo-labeled H7N9 PB1-F2 is phagocytosed rapidly into the lysosomal pathway, as indicated by increased PB1-F2 red fluorescence within cellular vesicles (Fig. 2, 120 min). This event is followed by ASC speck formation (Fig. 2, top panels, 200 min). Notably, treatment of ASC-cerulean cells with latrunculin A prior to challenge with pHrodo-labeled H7N9 PB1-F2 blocked cellular uptake of the peptide aggregate, prohibiting ASC speck formation (supplemental Movie 3). To confirm that H7N9 PB1-F2 activates the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, we compared iBMDMs derived from mice deficient in the inflammasome components caspase-1/11, ASC, or NLRP3 with iBMDMs from WT mice (17Hornung V. Bauernfeind F. Halle A. Samstad E.O. Kono H. Rock K.L. Fitzgerald K.A. Latz E. Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). In WT iBMDMs, H7N9 PB1-F2 induced IL-1β secretion in a dose-dependent manner at levels comparable with the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome activators silica and poly(dA-dT) (Fig. 3A). ASC- (Fig. 3B) and NLRP3-deficient (Fig. 3C) iBMDMs failed to secrete IL-1β in response to H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide. Notably, the dependence on caspase-1 as seen in our earlier experiments was supported by the abrogation of IL-1β secretion in caspase-1-deficient iBMDMs challenged with H7N9 PB1-F2 (Fig. 3D). Priming of the inflammasome in all iBMDM lines was confirmed by disrupting cellular membranes of LPS-stimulated cells by repeated freeze-thawing and analysis of cellular lysate IL-1β concentrations (Fig. 3, A–D, Lysate). Validating these data, and consistent with earlier reports (17Hornung V. Bauernfeind F. Halle A. Samstad E.O. Kono H. Rock K.L. Fitzgerald K.A. Latz E. Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar), cells exposed to silica displayed ASC-, NLRP3-, and caspase-1-dependent responses (Fig. 3, B–D) whereas those transfected with poly(dA-dT) showed only a requirement for caspase-1 (Fig. 3D) and ASC (Fig. 3B). Using primary BMDMs generated from WT and NLRP3-deficient mice, we confirmed that NLRP3 is required for H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide-induced IL-1β secretion in (supplemental Fig. 3A). The requirement of NLRP3 for H7N9 PB1-F2-induced IL-1β production was further verified in primary BMDMs from WT and NLRP3−/− mice by immunoblot. BMDMs were primed with LPS, challenged with either PR8- or H7N9-derived PB1-F2, and assessed for levels of caspase-1 p20 and IL-1β p17 in cell supernatants. Proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 was detected following stimulation of WT BMDMs with PR8 PB1-F2, H7N9 PB1-F2, silica or poly(dA-dT) (Fig. 3E, top panels). In agreement with this, processing of IL-1β into mature and bioactive p17 was detected in these samples (Fig. 3E, bottom panels). Neither caspase-1 p20 nor IL-1 p17 were detected in PR8 PB1-F2-, H7N9 PB1-F2-, or silica-challenged NLRP3−/− BMDMs (Fig. 3E, top and bottom panels). Caspase-1 p20 and IL-1β p17 were detected in NLRP3−/− BMDMs stimulated with poly(dA-dT), indicating the presence of a fully functional and activated AIM2 inflammasome in these cells. This result was validated by the analysis of IL-1β levels in these samples by ELISA supplemental Fig. 3B). PB1-F2 derived from H1N1 strains has been described previously as containing a mitochondrial targeting sequence (19Chen C.J. Chen G.W. Wang C.H. Huang C.H. Wang Y.C. Shih S.R. Differential localization and function of PB1-F2 derived from different strains of influenza A virus.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 10051-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. A novel influenza A virus mitochondrial protein that induces cell death.Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) that disrupts mitochondrial function commensurate with the C-terminal domain that, as we have found, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. Given that mtROS have been found previously to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, we examined whether H7N9 and PR8 PB1-F2 peptide could induce mtROS. ASC-cerulean iBMDMs were pretreated with MitoSOX Red, a mitochondrially localized fluorogenic dye selective for mitochondrial superoxide in live cells (21Robinson K.M. Janes M.S. Pehar M. Monette J.S. Ross M.F. Hagen T.M. Murphy M.P. Beckman J.S. Selective fluorescent imaging of superoxide in vivo using ethidium-based probes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15038-15043Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), prior to challenge with H7N9 and PR8 PB1-F2 peptides. As can be observed in supplemental Movies 4 and 5, respectively, live cell imaging of H7N9 and PR8 PB1-F2-treated iBMDMs demonstrated increased mitochondrial fluorescence intensity of MitoSOX rapidly following treatment. Bafilomycin treatment of cells demonstrated that phagolysosomal disruption is required for PB1-F2-induced mtROS production (supplemental Movie 6). To examine whether PB1-F2 peptide-induced mtROS plays a role in PB1-F2-induced inflammasome activation, we next treated both iBMDMs (Fig. 4A) and human PBMCs (Fig. 4D) with micromolar concentrations of MitoTempo and examined PB1-F2 peptide-induced IL-1β secretion. We found that MitoTempo significantly inhibited PB1-F2-induced secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we found that MitoTempo inhibited the proteolytic maturation of both IL-1β and caspase-1 by PB1-F2 H7N9 and PR8 peptides (Fig. 4B) in primary BMDMs, in which secretion of IL-1β was also confirmed (Fig. 4C), and in human PBMCs (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results suggest that, commensurate with previous studies, PB1-F2 localizes to the mitochondria to induce mtROS, which leads to activation of the inflammasome and IL-1β maturation and secretion. We next confirmed the requirement for NLRP3 to elicit H7N9 PB1-F2-induced IL-1β secretion by examining inflammatory responses to the peptide in vivo. Neutrophils are known to be recruited in response to NLRP3-inflammasome activation in immune cells (4Iwasaki A. Pillai P.S. Innate immunity to influenza virus infection.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 22Grailer J.J. Canning B.A. Kalbitz M. Haggadone M.D. Dhond R.M. Andjelkovic A.V. Zetoune F.S. Ward P.A. Critical role for the NLRP3 inflammasome during acute lung injury.J. Immunol. 2014; 192: 5974-5983Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). WT and NLRP3−/− mice were intranasally inoculated with the H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide. At 7 h following treatment, significant neutrophil influx was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the airways of WT mice (Fig. 5A). Importantly, the cellular infiltrates observed in PB1-F2-treated NLRP3−/− mice were significantly reduced compared with WT mice (Fig. 5A). The difference in cellular infiltration observed between WT and NLRP3−/− mice treated with H7N9 PB1-F2 was reflected in significantly lower concentrations of IL-1β in BAL from NLRP3−/− mice compared with WT animals (Fig. 5B). Collectively, these data highlight the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the maturation of IL-1β in response to H7N9-derived PB1-F2 peptide both in vitro and in vivo. To explore whether H7N9-derived PB1-F2 protein expressed by virions during infection would induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation similar to that observed for the PR8 PB1-F2 protein, we attempted to use reverse genetics to generate IAVs expressing the PB1 gene derived from A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) on the backbone of several well characterized laboratory strains. In parallel, to generate a mutant H7N9, we genetically modified the H7N9 PB1 plasmid to disrupt the PB1-F2 open reading frame and abrogate PB1-F2 expression, as demonstrated previously with PR8 (13McAuley J.L. Tate M.D. MacKenzie-Kludas C.J. Pinar A. Zeng W. Stutz A. Latz E. Brown L.E. Mansell A. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by IAV virulence protein PB1-F2 contributes to severe pathophysiology and disease.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003392Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Using well established techniques, we attempted to reverse-engineer IAVs containing a wild-type or mutant H7N9 PB1 gene and the remaining seven viral genes derived from HKx31 (H3N2), A/Udorn/1972 (H3N2), or A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8, H1N1). Despite multiple attempts, the infectious virus could not be rescued, suggesting that the H7N9 PB1 gene is incompatible for incorporation into viruses of either the H3N2 or H1N1 subtypes. The reasons for this unexpected outcome are currently being explored. Recently, Coll et al. (23Coll R.C. Robertson A.A. Chae J.J. Higgins S.C. Muñoz-Planillo R. Inserra M.C. Vetter I. Dungan L.S.

Med. 2015; 21: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar) described MCC950 as a potent (IC50, 7 nm) and specific diarylsulfonylurea-based inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasome activity that acts by preventing ASC complex formation with potent activity in vivo. This compound represents both a potential NLPR3 therapeutic agent and also provides an important tool to dissect the temporal role of NLRP3 during infectious disease pathophysiology, which is not possible using gene-deficient mice (11Tate M.D. Ong J.D. Dowling J.K. McAuley J.L. Robertson A.B. Latz E. Drummond G.R. Cooper M.A. Hertzog P.J. Mansell A. Reassessing the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome during pathogenic influenza A virus infection via temporal inhibition.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 27912Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We investigated the ability of MCC950 to inhibit NLRP3 activation in response to H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide in vitro. Macrophages were primed with LPS and then pretreated with MCC950 prior to challenge with PB1-F2 peptides from PR8 or H7N9 or with silica. Pretreatment with micromolar concentrations of MCC950 potently inhibited secretion of IL-1β by iBMDM (Fig. 6, A and B) and primary BMDMs (Fig. 6C) that were subsequently challenged with PR8 PB1-F2, H7N9 PB1-F2 or silica. It was also observed that ASC-cerulean cells pretreated with MCC950 were able to phagocytose pHrodo-labeled H7N9 PB1-F2 peptide but did not undergo ASC speck formation (supplemental Movies 7 and 8), suggesting that MCC950 acts prior to ASC oligomerization. Proteolytic cleavage of caspase-1 was detected in cell supernatants from BMDMs stimulated with either PR8- or H7N9-derived PB1-F2 or silica but not in supernatants from cells treated with MCC950 (Fig. 6D, top panel). Correlative maturation of bioactive IL-1β p17 was detected in supernatants of cells treated with either PR8- or H7N9-derived PB1-F2 or silica (Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2558403885,"Zinc is vastly present in the mammalian brain and controls functions of various cell surface receptors to regulate neurotransmission. A distinctive characteristic of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors containing a GluN2A subunit is that their ion channel activity is allosterically inhibited by a nano-molar concentration of zinc that binds to an extracellular domain called an amino-terminal domain (ATD). Despite physiological importance, the molecular mechanism underlying the high-affinity zinc inhibition has been incomplete because of the lack of a GluN2A ATD structure. Here we show the first crystal structures of the heterodimeric GluN1-GluN2A ATD, which provide the complete map of the high-affinity zinc-binding site and reveal distinctive features from the ATD of the GluN1-GluN2B subtype. Perturbation of hydrogen bond networks at the hinge of the GluN2A bi-lobe structure affects both zinc inhibition and open probability, supporting the general model in which the bi-lobe motion in ATD regulates the channel activity in NMDA receptors."

However, to date, no information about the role of miR-497 in the development of atherosclerosis has been reported. This study investigated the possible role of miR-497 in vascular endothelial cell injury during the early stage of atherosclerosis.The expression level of miR-497 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to ox-LDL was detected using qRT-PCR. To perform gain of function and loss of function analyses, miR-497 mimics were transfected into HUVECs, and miR-497 inhibitors were transfected into HUVECs stimulated with ox-LDL. Flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle progression and apoptosis. EdU and CCK-8 assays were employed to detect DNA synthesis and cell proliferation, respectively. After bioinformatics prediction, a dual Luciferase Reporter assay was used to analyze the direct target genes of miR-497. The mRNA and protein levels of the target genes were detected using qRT-PCR and western blot analyses, respectively. Caspase-9/3 activity was analyzed to determine the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction.We showed that miR-497 was significantly upregulated in HUVECs stimulated with ox-LDL. Ectopic expression of miR-497 suppressed cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and increased the activity of caspase-9/3. After verification, Bcl2 and CCND2 were shown to be direct target genes of miR-497 in HUVECs. MiR-497 significantly suppressed cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle through the CCND2 protein and induced apoptosis through the Bcl2/Bax-caspase9-caspase3 pathway.Overall, our study shows that miR-497 might play a role in the development of atherosclerosis by inducing apoptosis and suppressing the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, miR-497 could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis."

Non-invasive imaging of gene expression can be used to track implanted cells in vivo but often requires the addition of an exogenous contrast agent that may have limited tissue access1. We show that the urea transporter (UT-B) can be used as a gene reporter, where reporter expression is detected using 1H MRI measurements of UT-B-mediated increases in plasma membrane water exchange. HEK cells transfected with the reporter showed an increased apparent water exchange rate (AXR), which increased in line with UT-B expression. AXR values measured in vivo, in UT-B-expressing HEK cell xenografts, were significantly higher (about twofold, P < 0.0001), compared with non-expressing controls. Fluorescence imaging of a red fluorescent protein (mStrawberry), co-expressed with UT-B showed that UT-B expression correlated in a linear fashion with AXR. Transduction of rat brain cells in situ with a lentiviral vector expressing UT-B resulted in about a twofold increase in AXR at the site of virus injection."
https://openalex.org/W2560632721,"The role of osteolineage cells in regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regeneration following myelosuppression is not well understood. Here we show that deletion of the pro-apoptotic genes Bak and Bax in osterix (Osx, also known as Sp7 transcription factor 7)-expressing cells in mice promotes HSC regeneration and hematopoietic radioprotection following total body irradiation. These mice showed increased bone marrow (BM) levels of the protein dickkopf-1 (Dkk1), which was produced in Osx-expressing BM cells. Treatment of irradiated HSCs with Dkk1 in vitro increased the recovery of both long-term repopulating HSCs and progenitor cells, and systemic administration of Dkk1 to irradiated mice increased hematopoietic recovery and improved survival. Conversely, inducible deletion of one allele of Dkk1 in Osx-expressing cells in adult mice inhibited the recovery of BM stem and progenitor cells and of complete blood counts following irradiation. Dkk1 promoted hematopoietic regeneration via both direct effects on HSCs, in which treatment with Dkk1 decreased the levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and suppressed senescence, and indirect effects on BM endothelial cells, in which treatment with Dkk1 induced epidermal growth factor (EGF) secretion. Accordingly, blockade of the EGF receptor partially abrogated Dkk1-mediated hematopoietic recovery. These data identify Dkk1 as a regulator of hematopoietic regeneration and demonstrate paracrine cross-talk between BM osteolineage cells and endothelial cells in regulating hematopoietic reconstitution following injury."

The nature and consequence of DNA lesions generated during reprogramming are not known. Using mouse genetics and chemical biology, we discovered that Tet3-dependent zygotic reprogramming generates paternal DNA lesions that are monitored by a surveillance mechanism. In vivo structure-function rescue assays revealed that cohesin-dependent repair of paternal DNA lesions prevents activation of a Chk1-dependent checkpoint that delays mitotic entry. Culturing conditions affect checkpoint stringency, which has implications for human in vitro fertilization. We propose the zygotic checkpoint senses DNA lesions generated during paternal DNA demethylation and ensures reprogrammed loci are repaired before mitosis to prevent chromosome fragmentation, embryo loss, and infertility."
https://openalex.org/W2560742044,"Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes catalyze stepwise oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (mC) to yield 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC) and the rarer bases 5-formylcytosine (fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (caC). Stepwise oxidation obscures how each individual base forms and functions in epigenetic regulation, and prompts the question of whether TET enzymes primarily serve to generate hmC or are adapted to produce fC and caC as well. By mutating a single, conserved active site residue in human TET2, Thr1372, we uncovered enzyme variants that permit oxidation to hmC but largely eliminate fC and caC. Biochemical analyses, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, elucidated an active site scaffold that is required for wild-type (WT) stepwise oxidation and that, when perturbed, explains the mutants' hmC-stalling phenotype. Our results suggest that the TET2 active site is shaped to enable higher-order oxidation and provide the first TET variants that could be used to probe the biological functions of hmC separately from fC and caC."
https://openalex.org/W2559752379,"The olfactory system faces a hard problem: on the basis of noisy information from olfactory receptor neurons (the neurons that transduce chemicals to neural activity), it must figure out which odors are present in the world. Odors almost never occur in isolation, and different odors excite overlapping populations of olfactory receptor neurons, so the central challenge of the olfactory system is to demix its input. Because of noise and the large number of possible odors, demixing is fundamentally a probabilistic inference task. We propose that the early olfactory system uses approximate Bayesian inference to solve it. The computations involve a dynamical loop between the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex, with cortex explaining incoming activity from the olfactory receptor neurons in terms of a mixture of odors. The model is compatible with known anatomy and physiology, including pattern decorrelation, and it performs better than other models at demixing odors."
https://openalex.org/W2559969061,"The ability to produce extremely small and circular supercoiled vectors has opened new territory for improving non-viral gene therapy vectors. In this work, we compared transfection of supercoiled DNA vectors ranging from 383 to 4,548 bp, each encoding shRNA against GFP under control of the H1 promoter. We assessed knockdown of GFP by electroporation into HeLa cells. All of our vectors entered cells in comparable numbers when electroporated with equal moles of DNA. Despite similar cell entry, we found length-dependent differences in how efficiently the vectors knocked down GFP. As vector length increased up to 1,869 bp, GFP knockdown efficiency per mole of transfected DNA increased. From 1,869 to 4,257 bp, GFP knockdown efficiency per mole was steady, then decreased with increasing vector length. In comparing GFP knockdown with equal masses of vectors, we found that the shorter vectors transfect more efficiently per nanogram of DNA transfected. Our results rule out cell entry and DNA mass as determining factors for gene knockdown efficiency via electroporation. The length-dependent effects we have uncovered are likely explained by differences in nuclear translocation or transcription. These data add an important step towards clinical applications of non-viral vector delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2557738316,"Glutathione degradation plays an important role in glutathione and redox homeostasis, and thus it is imperative to understand the enzymes and the mechanisms involved in glutathione degradation in detail. We describe here ChaC2, a member of the ChaC family of γ-glutamylcyclotransferases, as an enzyme that degrades glutathione in the cytosol of mammalian cells. ChaC2 is distinct from the previously described ChaC1, to which ChaC2 shows ∼50% sequence identity. Human and mouse ChaC2 proteins purified in vitro show 10–20-fold lower catalytic efficiency than ChaC1, although they showed comparable Km values (Km of 3.7 ± 0.4 mm and kcat of 15.9 ± 1.0 min−1 toward glutathione for human ChaC2; Km of 2.2 ± 0.4 mm and kcat of 225.2 ± 15 min−1 toward glutathione for human ChaC1). The ChaC1 and ChaC2 proteins also shared the same specificity for reduced glutathione, with no activity against either γ-glutamyl amino acids or oxidized glutathione. The ChaC2 proteins were found to be expressed constitutively in cells, unlike the tightly regulated ChaC1. Moreover, lower eukaryotes have a single member of the ChaC family that appears to be orthologous to ChaC2. In addition, we determined the crystal structure of yeast ChaC2 homologue, GCG1, at 1.34 Å resolution, which represents the first structure of the ChaC family of proteins. The catalytic site is defined by a fortuitous benzoic acid molecule bound to the crystal structure. The mechanism for binding and catalytic activity of this new enzyme of glutathione degradation, which is involved in continuous but basal turnover of cytosolic glutathione, is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2559082763,"Sensing the level of oxygen in the external and internal environments is essential for survival. Organisms have evolved multiple mechanisms to sense oxygen. No function in oxygen sensing has been attributed to any mammalian olfactory system. Here, we demonstrate that low environmental oxygen directly activates a subpopulation of sensory neurons in the mouse main olfactory epithelium. These neurons express the soluble guanylate cyclase Gucy1b2 and the cation channel Trpc2. Low oxygen induces calcium influx in these neurons, and Gucy1b2 and Trpc2 are required for these responses. In vivo exposure of a mouse to low environmental oxygen causes Gucy1b2-dependent activation of olfactory bulb neurons in the vicinity of the glomeruli formed by axons of Gucy1b2+ sensory neurons. Low environmental oxygen also induces conditioned place aversion, for which Gucy1b2 and Trpc2 are required. We propose that this chemosensory function enables a mouse to rapidly assess the oxygen level in the external environment."
https://openalex.org/W2559250752,"To ensure successful parasitism, parasitoid wasps inject venom along with their eggs into their hosts. The venom serves to suppress host immune responses, including melanization. Venom from Pteromalus puparum, a pupal endoparasitoid, inhibits melanization of host hemolymph in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Using assay-guided fractionation, a serpin splicing isoform with phenoloxidase inhibitory activity was identified as P puparum serpin-1, venom isoform (PpS1V). This serpin gene has 16 predicted splicing isoforms that differ only in the C-terminal region. RT-PCR results show that the specific serpin isoform is differentially expressed in the venom gland. Recombinant PpS1V (rPpS1V) suppresses host prophenoloxidase (PPO) activation rather than inhibiting the phenoloxidase directly. Pulldown assays show that PpS1V forms complexes with two host hemolymph proteins, here named Pieris rapae hemolymph proteinase 8 (PrHP8) and P. rapae prophenoloxidase-activating proteinase 1 (PrPAP1), based on gene sequence blasting and phylogenetic analysis. The role of rPrPAP1 in the PPO activation cascade and its interaction with rPpS1V were confirmed. The stoichiometry of inhibition of PrPAP1 by PpS1V is 2.3. PpS1V also inhibits PPO activation in a non-natural host, Ostrinia furnacalis, through forming a complex with O. furnacalis serine protease 13 (OfSP13), an ortholog to PrPAP1. Our results identify a venom-enriched serpin isoform in P. puparum that inhibits host PPO activation, probably by forming a complex with host hemolymph proteinase PrPAP1."
https://openalex.org/W2559829696,"Neonatal mouse cochlear supporting cells have a limited ability to divide and trans-differentiate into hair cells, but this ability declines rapidly in the two weeks after birth. This decline is concomitant with the morphological and functional maturation of the organ of Corti prior to the onset of hearing. However, despite this association between maturation and loss of regenerative potential, little is known of the molecular changes that underlie these events. To identify these changes, we used RNA-seq to generate transcriptional profiles of purified cochlear supporting cells from 1- and 6-day-old mice. We found many significant changes in gene expression during this period, many of which were related to regulation of proliferation, differentiation of inner ear components and the maturation of the organ of Corti prior to the onset of hearing. One example of a change in regenerative potential of supporting cells is their robust production of hair cells in response to a blockade of the Notch signaling pathway at the time of birth, but a complete lack of response to such blockade just a few days later. By comparing our supporting cell transcriptomes to those of supporting cells cultured in the presence of Notch pathway inhibitors, we show that the transcriptional response to Notch blockade disappears almost completely in the first postnatal week. Our results offer some of the first molecular insights into the failure of hair cell regeneration in the mammalian cochlea."

Loss of Bcp1 causes instability of Rpl23 and deficiency of 60S subunits. In summary, Bcp1 is a novel 60S biogenesis factor via chaperoning Rpl23 in the nucleus. The ribosome is a large macromolecular complex responsible for decoding cellular genetic information into proteins. There are two ribosomal subunits; in the eukaryotes, they are the (60S) large subunit and the small (40S) subunit, each composed of both rRNAs and ribosomal proteins. In eukaryotic cells, the assembly of ribosomes occurs in the nucleolus, a subcompartment of the nucleus devoted to ribosome biogenesis. rRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase I and III, and the initial assembly and processing events occur co-transcriptionally. The mRNAs of ribosomal proteins are transcribed in the nucleus by RNA polymerase II and translated in the cytoplasm. Consequently, the ribosomal proteins must be imported into the nucleus for assembly with the rRNAs. After ribosome assemblies have achieved a certain stage of maturation, export factors are loaded to direct these huge complexes to cross the nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore complexes (1Bradatsch B.

In the cytoplasm, ribosomes undergo additional steps in the maturation process; the trans-acting factors that are exported with nascent ribosomal subunits need to be stripped off, additional ribosomal proteins are added, and in the case of the 40S subunit, the final rRNA processing occurs (7Woolford Jr., J.L.

This suggests that Bcp1 is physically involved in 60S biogenesis. However, the functional role of Bcp1 in 60S biogenesis is still not clear. Tif6 is a shuttling factor but is found predominantly in the nucleus and nucleolus. Its homolog in higher eukaryotic cells is eIF6. Tif6 is required for 60S ribosome biogenesis (17Basu U. Si K.

The presence of Tif6 is thought to prevent inappropriate interaction with 40S subunits before 60S matures completely.

BCCIPβ, the human homolog of Bcp1, was shown to interact with eIF6 and Rpl23 as a small complex, but depletion of BCCIPβ did not show deficiency in 60S biogenesis (31Wyler E. Wandrey F. Badertscher L. Montellese C. Alper D. Kutay U. The β-isoform of the BRCA2 and CDKN1A(p21)-interacting protein (BCCIP) stabilizes nuclear RPL23/uL14.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 3685-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These data point to a functional significance of Bcp1 with Rpl23 in the ribosome biogenesis pathway. In this study, Bcp1 is identified as a chaperone of Rpl23 in yeast. Loss of Bcp1 results in the deficiency of Rpl23 and the 60S subunits. Bcp1 works as an escortin to dissociate Rpl23 from the karyopherins and interacts with Rpl23 as a complex, which facilitates the loading of Rpl23 into nascent 60S subunits. To develop a deeper understanding of the role of Bcp1 in ribosome biogenesis, we assayed export and levels of 60S subunits in a bcp1ts mutant, with a single phenylalanine to serine substitution mutation at amino acid 241 (11Audhya A. Emr S.D. Regulation of PI4,5P2 synthesis by nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of the Mss4 lipid kinase.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4223-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Rpl11B (uL5)-GFP was used to monitor the distribution of 60S subunits in bcp1ts mutant cells. Whereas Rpl11 was localized in the cytoplasm in bcp1ts at permissive temperature, it accumulated in the nucleus at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with previous reports that the 60S subunits, monitored by Rpl11 (uL5) or Rpl25 (uL23), were trapped in the nucleus if the function of Bcp1 was deactivated (11Audhya A. Emr S.D.

Rps2 (uS5)-GFP was also monitored in bcp1ts cells, and no change was observed (data not shown), indicating that the bcp1ts mutant affected 60S but not 40S export. To further investigate ribosome biogenesis in bcp1 mutant cells, cell extracts from bcp1ts and wild-type cells were fractionated by sedimentation through sucrose density gradients. Compared with wild-type cells (60S/40S ratio = 1.66), bcp1ts cells showed slight underaccumulation of 60S levels and halfmers at 30 °C (60S/40S ratio = 0.79), and these defects were enhanced at 37 °C (60S/40S ratio = 0.31) (Fig. 1B). Halfmers are formed when cells have insufficient levels of 60S subunits to efficiently associate with 40S subunits during translation initiation. These data suggest that Bcp1 is required for 60S biogenesis. Because inactivation of Bcp1 trapped Rpl11 (uL5) in the nucleus, we suspected that Bcp1 might be involved in the ribosome export process. The bcp1ts mutant was crossed with a panel of characterized ribosome export factor mutants, including nmd3(AAA) (5Ho J.H. Kallstrom G. Johnson A.W.

Bcp1ts showed synthetic sickness (Fig. 2A) and more severe 60S biogenesis defects (Fig. 2B) with all of these mutants compared with each single mutant. We anticipated that if Bcp1 was directly involved in the export process, then BCP1 would be a high copy suppressor of these various export mutants. However, high copy BCP1 did not suppress any of them (data not shown). Furthermore, MEX67, MTR2, ARX1, NMD3, and CRM1 were not dosage suppressors of bcp1ts (data not shown). These data suggest that the nuclear accumulation of 60S subunits in bcp1ts mutant cells results from blocking ribosome biogenesis but is not directly linked to the export process. To further dissect the function of Bcp1 in the 60S maturation pathway, a high copy suppressor screen was performed. A 2μ yeast genomic library was transformed into bcp1ts (KLY106) strain, and colonies were screened for better growth at 37 °C. RPL23A was the only gene identified as a dosage suppressor of the bcp1ts mutant in this screen. This led us to consider that Bcp1 functionally interacts with Rpl23. There are two paralogs of RPL23, RPL23A and RPL23B, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that encode proteins of identical sequences. First, we tested whether elevated levels of either RPL23A or RPL23B could suppress the impaired growth of bcp1ts. RPL23A or RPL23B was constructed on 2-μm plasmid and transformed to bcp1ts. Whereas bcp1ts was very slow growing at 37 °C, RPL23A and RPL23B each could partially rescue the growth of bcp1ts mutant at non-permissive temperature (Fig. 3A, 37 °C). However, high copy RPL23 could not replace BCP1 (Fig. 3A, 5FOA). This is consistent with the idea that Bcp1 has another function in exporting Mss4 and/or that Bcp1 is absolutely required for the proper function of Rpl23. Deletion of RPL23A or RPL23B resulted in a slight growth defect; however, combining the deletion of either RPL23A or RPL23B with the bcp1ts mutation resulted in a severe growth defect (Fig. 3B). Therefore, the genetic interaction results implied that the function of BCP1 was related to RPL23. We further tested whether suppression by overexpression of RPL23 also rescued the 60S biogenesis defects of bcp1ts monitored by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Protein extracts, prepared from bcp1ts cells expressing vector or RPL23A, were cultured for 1 h at 37 °C and were fractionated through sucrose gradients. Compared with the vector control (60S/40S ratio = 0.31), increasing levels of Rpl23 increased the levels of 60S ribosomal subunits (60S/40S ratio = 0.62) and decreased the levels of halfmers (Fig. 3C). We next examined 60S subunit export in bcp1ts cells expressing 2μ RPL23 by monitoring Rpl11-GFP localization. Whereas about 60% of the bcp1ts cells exhibited nuclear accumulation of Rpl11-GFP, bcp1ts cells with dosage suppressor RPL23 supported a higher level of export, with only 15% of cells showing nuclear Rpl11-GFP signal (Fig. 3D). In conclusion, overexpression of RPL23 rescued the 60S biogenesis defects of bcp1ts. Previous results of large scale protein interactions by mass spectrometric analyses (25Krogan N.J. Peng W.T.

To test this assumption, Bcp1 and Rpl23 were fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) or activation domain (AD), and potential interaction was tested using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Combinations of different bait and prey plasmids were then transformed to the reporter strain PJ69-4A. Interactions of the fusion proteins were monitored by streaking colonies on a histidine dropout plate. Whereas Bcp1 or Rpl23 fusion alone did not grow, cells co-expressing Bcp1-AD and Rpl23-BD could grow on the reporter plate and vice versa (Fig. 4A). To further demonstrate that Bcp1 and Rpl23 interact directly, we overexpressed these two proteins in Escherichia coli and tested for in vitro interaction. Bcp1 was expressed as a recombinant protein with a C-terminal His tag, and Rpl23 was expressed as the native form, without any tag. After incubation with an Ni-NTA resin, Bcp1 was bound strongly onto the beads, whereas Rpl23 was not detectably bound (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Once Bcp1 and Rpl23 were incubated together, Rpl23 was co-purified with Bcp1 together by the Ni-NTA resin and insensitive to RNase treatment (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 6). This suggests that Bcp1 and Rpl23 interact directly. We next performed immunoprecipitation to test the interaction between Bcp1 and Rpl23 and determined whether this interaction occurred on or off pre-60S subunits. The ribosome biogenesis factors, Arx1, Tif6, and Nmd3, which bind to nascent 60S subunits containing Rpl23, were used as controls. Arx1, Tif6, and Nmd3 all pulled down both Rpl23-HA and Rpl8 (Fig. 4C), an independent marker for 60S subunits, demonstrating that they interact with the 60S subunits. In contrast, Bcp1 pulled down relatively more Rpl23, but Rpl8 was not detected (Fig. 4C). This result suggests that Bcp1 interaction with Rpl23 occurs primarily off the 60S subunit. Consistent with this interpretation, the majority of Bcp1 was shown as free form in sucrose density gradients (Fig. 4D). For additional evidence that Bcp1 bound free Rpl23, we took advantage of the fact that the Rpl23-GFP fusion protein did not interact with 60S subunits (Fig. 4D). Rpl23-GFP co-immunoprecipitated with Bcp1 but not with Arx1 or Tif6 and only modestly with Nmd3 (Fig. 4C). To avoid potential interference from the tag and plasmid expression system, immunoprecipitated was also carried out against Bcp1 and Tif6 from genomic TAP-tagged strains and detected by anti-Rpl23 and anti-Rpl8 antibodies for comparison. Consistent with Fig. 4C, whereas Tif6 interacted with both Rpl23 and Rpl8, Bcp1 interacted with only Rpl23 and not Rpl8 (data not shown). As a final demonstration that Bcp1 interacts preferentially with Rpl23 off 60S, protein extracts were spun with ultracentrifugation (385,900 × g for 60 min) for separation of free and ribosome-containing fractions and immunoprecipitated Tif6, Nmd3, and Bcp1 and their associated proteins from two pools. Tif6 and Nmd3 immunoprecipitated Rpl23 only from the ribosome-containing fractions (Fig. 4E). In contrast, whereas the majority of Rpl23 co-fractionated with the ribosomes (Figs. 4D and 5A), the Bcp1-Rpl23 interaction was detected only from the free protein pool (Fig. 4E). Unlike Tif6- and Nmd3-immunoprecipitated complexes containing ribosomal proteins, Rpl8 and Rpl23 in this case were not detected on Bcp1-containing complex isolated from the pellet fraction. Bcp1 may exhibit as a small complex and was separated to the ribosome-containing fraction during ultracentrifugation, or Bcp1 may associate with 60S very transiently. These data show that Bcp1 and Rpl23 preferentially interact as free proteins off 60S subunits. Ribosomal proteins are typically highly positively charged to stably interact with the negative charge of rRNAs. It has been shown that karyopherins or chaperones interact with ribosomal proteins to maintain their solubility and also facilitate their loading into nascent ribosomal subunits (33Calviño F.R.

https://openalex.org/W2558296979,"While beneficial effects of fasting on organismal function and health are well appreciated, we know little about the molecular details of how fasting influences synaptic function and plasticity. Our genetic and electrophysiological experiments demonstrate that acute fasting blocks retrograde synaptic enhancement that is normally triggered as a result of reduction in postsynaptic receptor function at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). This negative regulation critically depends on transcriptional enhancement of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein (4E-BP) under the control of the transcription factor Forkhead box O (Foxo). Furthermore, our findings indicate that postsynaptic 4E-BP exerts a constitutive negative input, which is counteracted by a positive regulatory input from the Target of Rapamycin (TOR). This combinatorial retrograde signaling plays a key role in regulating synaptic strength. Our results provide a mechanistic insight into how cellular stress and nutritional scarcity could acutely influence synaptic homeostasis and functional stability in neural circuits."

We evaluated whether providing additional pre-pregnancy weekly iron-folic acid (IFA) or multiple micronutrient (MM) supplements compared to only folic acid (FA) improves iron status and anemia during pregnancy and early postpartum.We conducted a double blind randomized controlled trial in which 5011 Vietnamese women were provided with weekly supplements containing either only 2800 μg FA (control group), IFA (60 mg Fe and 2800 μg FA) or MM (15 micronutrients with similar amounts of IFA). All women who became pregnant (n = 1813) in each of the 3 groups received daily IFA (60 mg Fe and 400 μg FA) through delivery. Hematological indicators were assessed at baseline (pre-pregnancy), during pregnancy, 3 months post-partum, and in cord blood. Adjusted generalized linear models were applied to examine the impact of preconception supplementation on anemia and iron stores, using both intention to treat and per protocol analyses (women consumed supplements ≥ 26 weeks before conception).At baseline, 20% of women were anemic, but only 14% had low iron stores (ferritin <30 μg/L) and 3% had iron deficiency (ferritin <12 μg/L). The groups were balanced for baseline characteristics. Anemia prevalence increased during pregnancy and post-partum but was similar among intervention groups. In intention to treat analyses, prenatal ferritin was significantly higher among women receiving MM (geometric mean (μg/L) [95% CI]: 93.6 [89.3-98.2]) and IFA (91.9 [87.6-96.3]) compared to control (85.3 [81.5-89.2]). In per protocol analyses, women receiving MM or IFA had higher ferritin 3 months postpartum (MM 118.2 [109.3-127.8]), IFA 117.8 [108.7-127.7] vs control 101.5 [94.0-109.7]) and gave birth to infants with greater iron stores (MM 184.3 [176.1-192.9]), IFA 189.9 [181.6-198.3] vs control 175.1 [167.9-182.6]).Preconception supplementation with MM or IFA resulted in modest increases in maternal and infant iron stores but did not impact anemia.

Previous studies identified liver X receptor as the transcription factor controlling LPCAT3 expression in mouse liver tissue. Here we show that the hepatic LPCAT3 gene is transcriptionally regulated by PPARδ. Adenovirus-mediated knockdown of PPARδ in cultured hepatic cells and liver tissue reduced LPCAT3 mRNA levels, and exogenous overexpression of PPARδ increased LPCAT3 mRNA expression. Activation of PPARδ in HepG2, Huh7, and Hepa 1-6 cells with its specific agonists increased LPCAT3 mRNA levels in all three hepatic cell lines. Through conducting sequence analysis, LPCAT3 promoter assays, and direct DNA binding assays, we have mapped the functional PPAR-responsive element to a proximal region from −135 to −123 of the LPCAT3 promoter that plays an essential role in mediating PPARδ-induced transactivation of the LPCAT3 gene. Finally, we have provided in vivo evidence showing that activation of PPARδ by agonist L165041 in mice increased hepatic LPCAT3 mRNA abundance and LPCAT enzymatic activity, which is associated with increased incorporations of arachidonate into liver phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Furthermore, transient liver-specific knockdown of LPCAT3 in mice affected PPARδ-mediated activation of several hepatic genes involving in FA metabolism.

https://openalex.org/W2559875469,"Background and objective The study is based on hypothesis that whether continuous entomological surveillance of Ae. aegypti and simultaneous appropriate interventions in key containers during non-transmission (December–May) months would have any impact on breeding of Aedes and dengue cases during the following transmission months (June–November). The impact of the surveillance and intervention measures undertaken during non-transmission months were assessed by entomological indicators namely container index (CI), house index (HI), pupal index (PI) and breteau index (BI). Methods A total of 28 localities of West Zone of Delhi with persistent dengue endemicity were selected for the study. Out of these localities, 20 were included in study group while other 8 localities were in control group. IEC and various Aedes breeding control activities were carried out in study group in both non-transmission and transmission season whereas control group did not have any such interventions during non-transmission months as per guidelines of MCD. These activities were undertaken by a team of investigators from NIMR and SDMC, Delhi. In control group, investigators from NIMR carried out surveillance activity to monitor the breeding of Aedes mosquito in localities. Results Comparison of baseline data revealed that all indices in control and study group of localities were comparable and statistically non-significant (p>0.05). In both study and control groups, indices were calculated after pooling data on seasonal basis, i.e., transmission and non-transmission months for both years. The test of significance conducted on all the four indices, i.e., HI, PI, CI, and BI, revealed a significant difference (p<0.05) between the study group and control group during transmission and non-transmission months except in HI. Due to consistent intervention measures undertaken in non-transmission months in study group, reduction in CI, HI, BI and PI was observed 63%, 62%, 64% and 99% respectively during transmission months as compared to control group where increase of 59%, 102%, 73% and 71% respectively. As a result of reduction in larval indices, no dengue case (except one NS1) was observed in study group, whereas 38 dengue cases were observed in control group. Conclusion Through this pilot study, it is concluded that proper intervention in non-transmission season reduces vector density and subsequently dengue cases in transmission season."

However, building a characteristic model of human dynamics on the Internet involves a complete analysis of the variations in human activity patterns, which is a complex process. This complexity is inherent in human dynamics and has not been extensively studied to reveal the structural composition of human behavior. A typical method of anatomizing such a complex system is viewing all independent interconnectivity that constitutes the complexity. An examination of the various dimensions of human communication pattern in online interactions is presented in this paper. The study employed reliable server-side web data from 31 known users to explore characteristics of human-driven communications. Various machine-learning techniques were explored. The results revealed that each individual exhibited a relatively consistent, unique behavioral signature and that the logistic regression model and model tree can be used to accurately distinguish online users. These results are applicable to one-to-one online user identification processes, insider misuse investigation processes, and online profiling in various areas."

Visual Acuity was assessed and eye examination were performed by trained personnel. A questionnaire was used to collect personal and demographic information, and history of cataract surgery. Blindness and moderate Visual Impairment (MVI) was defined as presenting VA <6/60 and <6/18 to 6/60 in the better eye respectively.In total, 7378 (94.6%) were examined. Of these, 1228 eyes of 870 individuals were operated for cataract. The mean age of operated subjects was 63.7 years (SD: 10.7 years). Overall, 56.3% of those operated were women, 76% were illiterate and 42% of them were using spectacles after cataract surgery. Even after surgery, 12.2% of the operated eyes had MVI and blindness was seen in 14.7% of the eyes. A significantly higher proportion of subjects in urban area had good outcome as compared to those in the rural area (p = 0.01). Uncorrected refractive error (58.7%) was the leading cause of MVI, and posterior segment disease (34.3%) was the leading cause of blindness. On applying multiple logistic regression, risk factors for poor outcomes were age ≥ 70 years (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.8), rural residence (OR: 1.3, 95% CI:1.0-1.8) and presence of aphakia (OR: 8.9, 95% CI: 5.7-13.8).Post cataract surgery, refractive errors remain an important correctable cause of MVI, in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The correction of refractive errors is required to provide good visual recovery and achieve the benefit of cataract surgery."

However, the association between gestational medical diseases and familial history of CVD has not been investigated to date. In the present study, we examined the association between familial history of CVD and GHD or GDM via reliable questionnaires in a large cohort of registered nurses.The Korean Nurses' Survey was conducted through a web-based computer-assisted self-interview, which was developed through consultation with cardiologists, gynecologists, and statisticians. We enrolled a total of 9,989 female registered nurses who reliably answered the questionnaires including family history of premature CVD (FHpCVD), hypertension (FHH), and diabetes mellitus (FHDM) based on their medical knowledge. Either multivariable logistic regression analysis or generalized estimation equation was used to clarify the effect of positive family histories on GHD and GDM in subjects or at each repeated pregnancy in an individual.In this survey, 3,695 subjects had at least 1 pregnancy and 8,783 cumulative pregnancies. Among them, 247 interviewees (6.3%) experienced GHD and 120 (3.1%) experienced GDM. In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, obstetric, and gynecologic variables, age at the first pregnancy over 35 years (adjusted OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.02-2.43) and FHpCVD (adjusted OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.16-2.22) were risk factors for GHD in individuals, whereas FHH was not. FHDM and history of infertility therapy were risk factors for GDM in individuals (adjusted OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.86-3.86; 1.84, 95% CI 1.05-3.23, respectively). In any repeated pregnancies in an individual, age at the current pregnancy and at the first pregnancy, and FHpCVD were risk factors for GHD, while age at the current pregnancy, history of infertility therapy, and FHDM were risk factors for GDM.The FHpCVD and FHDM are significantly associated with GHD and GDM, respectively. Meticulous family histories should be obtained, and women with family histories of these conditions should be carefully monitored during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2560440601,"In this paper, we have proposed a novel alignment-free method for comparing the similarity of protein sequences. We first encode a protein sequence into a 440 dimensional feature vector consisting of a 400 dimensional Pseudo-Markov transition probability vector among the 20 amino acids, a 20 dimensional content ratio vector, and a 20 dimensional position ratio vector of the amino acids in the sequence. By evaluating the Euclidean distances among the representing vectors, we compare the similarity of protein sequences. We then apply this method into the ND5 dataset consisting of the ND5 protein sequences of 9 species, and the F10 and G11 datasets representing two of the xylanases containing glycoside hydrolase families, i.e., families 10 and 11. As a result, our method achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.962 with the canonical protein sequence aligner ClustalW in the ND5 dataset, much higher than those of other 5 popular alignment-free methods. In addition, we successfully separate the xylanases sequences in the F10 family and the G11 family and illustrate that the F10 family is more heat stable than the G11 family, consistent with a few previous studies. Moreover, we prove mathematically an identity equation involving the Pseudo-Markov transition probability vector and the amino acids content ratio vector."

To gain competitive advantage, management of present-day transnational firms always seeks options to trim down various transaction and coordination costs, especially in the area of controllable intra-supply chain system. This study investigates a multi-product intra-supply chain system with failure in rework. To achieve maximum machine utilization, multiple products are fabricated in succession on a single machine. During the process, production of some defective items is inevitable. Reworking of nonconforming items is used to reduce the quality cost in production and achieving the goal of lower overall production cost. Because reworks are sometimes unsuccessful, failures in rework are also considered in this study. Finished goods for each product are transported to the sales offices when the entire production lot is quality assured after rework. A multi-delivery policy is used, wherein fixed quantity n installments of the finished lot are transported at fixed intervals during delivery time. The objective is to jointly determine the common production cycle time and the number of deliveries needed to minimize the long-term expected production-inventory-delivery costs for the problem. With the help of a mathematical model along with optimization technique, the optimal production-shipment policy is obtained. We have used a numerical example to demonstrate applicability of the result of our research."
