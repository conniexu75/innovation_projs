https://openalex.org/W2122367477,"We have identified a novel zinc finger-containing transcription factor, called Osterix (Osx), that is specifically expressed in all developing bones. In Osx null mice, no bone formation occurs. In endochondral skeletal elements of Osx null mice, mesenchymal cells, together with osteoclasts and blood vessels, invade the mineralized cartilage matrix. However, the mesenchymal cells do not deposit bone matrix. Similarly, cells in the periosteum and in the condensed mesenchyme of membranous skeletal elements cannot differentiate into osteoblasts. These cells do, however, express Runx2/Cbfa1, another transcription factor required for bone formation. In contrast, Osx is not expressed in Runx2/Cbfa1 null mice. Thus, Osx acts downstream of Runx2/Cbfa1. Because Osx null preosteoblasts express typical chondrocyte marker genes, we propose that Runx2/Cbfa1-expressing preosteoblasts are still bipotential cells."

We have used patch clamp, dye flux, ATP assay, and Ca2+ imaging techniques to show that one mechanism for this intercellular Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes is the release of ATP through connexin channels (“hemichannels”) in individual cells. Astrocytes showed low Ca2+-activated whole-cell currents consistent with connexin hemichannel currents that were inhibited by the connexin channel inhibitor flufenamic acid (FFA). Astrocytes also showed molecular weight-specific influx and release of dyes, consistent with flux through connexin hemichannels. Transmembrane dye flux evoked by mechanical stimulation was potentiated by low Ca2+ and was inhibited by FFA and Gd3+. Mechanical stimulation also evoked release of ATP that was potentiated by low Ca2+ and inhibited by FFA and Gd3+. Similar whole-cell currents, transmembrane dye flux, and ATP release were observed in C6 glioma cells expressing connexin43 but were not observed in parent C6 cells.

In addition, pharmacological inhibitors of connexin channels have been shown to inhibit intercellular Ca2+ wave propagation in astrocytes (1Finkbeiner S.M.

These data show that connexin channel expression and function play a central role in Ca2+ wave propagation.Recent studies (9Guthrie P.B. Knappenberger J. Segal M. Bennett M.V.L. Charles A.C.

Ca2+waves in astrocytes induced by mechanical or electrical stimuli are associated with ATP release, and intercellular Ca2+ waves are blocked by purinergic receptor antagonists (9Guthrie P.B.

Chem. 2000; 72: 2001-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Multiple other stimuli that evoke astrocyte signaling, including glutamate and UTP, also evoke release of ATP (5Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 12Queiroz G.

However, in addition to docking with connexins in neighboring cells, connexins form “hemichannels” or “connexons” that exist independently within an individual cell (13Hofer A. Dermietzel R. Glia. 1998; 24: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Li H. Liu T.F. Lazrak A. Peracchia C. Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Johnson R.G. J.

Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similar to other membrane channels, connexin hemichannels are transmembrane channels that connect the cytoplasm and the extracellular space. Astrocytes in culture have been reported to express connexin hemichannels that allow transmembrane dye flux (13Hofer A. Dermietzel R. Glia. 1998; 24: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These channels may provide a pathway for release of small signaling molecules, such as ATP, to the extracellular space. Roles for both an extracellular messenger and connexins in intercellular Ca2+ signaling could therefore be reconciled by the hypothesis that the ATP that mediates Ca2+ waves is released through connexin hemichannels.Consistent with this hypothesis, Cotrina et al. (5Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) reported that ATP release from C6 glioma cells is increased in direct correlation with the level of forced connexin expression. Although these studies raised the possibility of a role for connexin channels in ATP release, they also found that ATP release was not inhibited by concentrations of octanol that were sufficient to inhibit gap junction channels as evidenced by dye coupling. Although this result would seem to contradict a direct role for connexin hemichannels in ATP release, it is possible that inhibitors of gap junctional coupling may not have the same effects or potency as inhibitors of connexin hemichannels. Bruzzone et al. (29Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) reported that transmembrane flux of NAD+ occurs via connexin43 hemichannels, indicating that the hemichannels composed of the primary astrocyte connexin are permeable to nucleotides. In the present study, we have used dye transfer and electrophysiological techniques to confirm the presence of connexin hemichannels in astrocytes. We have then used Ca2+imaging and ATP measurements to show that the extent of intercellular Ca2+ waves and ATP release in astrocytes is correlated with the function of connexin hemichannels.DISCUSSIONAstrocytes, like multiple other cell types, are capable of widespread communication via intercellular Ca2+ waves. Although initial studies (1Finkbeiner S.M. Glia. 1993; 9: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Charles A.C. Naus C.C. Zhu D. Kidder G.M. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) identified gap junctions as a pathway for communication of Ca2+ waves, more recent studies (9Guthrie P.B. Knappenberger J. Segal M. Bennett M.V.L. Charles A.C. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 520-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Lopez-Garcia J.C. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated an extracellular signaling pathway involving release of ATP and activation of purinergic receptors. Our results provide evidence that connexin hemichannels provide a pathway for this ATP release.First, we found that astrocytes express functional connexin hemichannels as evidenced by whole-cell patch clamp studies. Activation by low [Ca2+]e is characteristic of currents through connexin hemichannels (17Zampighi G.A. Loo D.D. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. McBride Jr., D.W. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 763-776Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The low [Ca2+]e-activated currents we observed in astrocytes are similar to those observed through connexin hemichannels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (17Zampighi G.A. Loo D.D. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Like connexin channel currents in oocytes, the low Ca2+-activated currents in astrocytes were reversibly inhibited by similar concentrations of flufenamic acid (21Zhang Y. McBride Jr., D.W. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 763-776Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Zhang D.Q. McMahon D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14754-14759Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although currents through connexin43 hemichannels have not been reported in oocyte models, our results indicate that expression of connexin43 in C6 cells results in the appearance of currents in single cells that are consistent with currents observed through gap junctions composed of connexin43.Transmembrane flux of low molecular weight dyes is a commonly used method for assessing the presence and function of connexin hemichannels. Consistent with previous reports (13Hofer A. Dermietzel R. Glia. 1998; 24: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we found that astrocytes show uptake of Calcein Blue or Lucifer Yellow, both low molecular weight dyes, but not the high molecular weight dye rhodamine dextran. In addition, we observed release of AM ester-loaded dyes in response to removal of extracellular Ca2+. Mechanical stimulation of astrocytes also evoked both uptake and release of low molecular weight dyes but not release of higher molecular weight dyes (Oregon Green BAPTA 1) or LDH. Mechanical stimulation evoked release of Calcein Blue from C6 Cx43 cells but not from non-transfected C6 cells. Dye release was inhibited by flufenamic acid and Gd3+, both of which are potent inhibitors of connexin hemichannels. In summary, the size selectivity, activation by removal of extracellular Ca2+, correlation with connexin43 expression in C6 cells, and inhibition by connexin channel inhibitors are all consistent with transmembrane dye flux via connexin hemichannels.Because intercellular Ca2+ signaling induced by mechanical stimulation and other stimuli has been associated with ATP release (5Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar,9Guthrie P.B. Knappenberger J. Segal M. Bennett M.V.L. Charles A.C. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 520-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wang Z. Haydon P.G. Yeung E.S. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2001-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we examined the role of connexin hemichannels in mechanically induced ATP release. Cotrina et al. (5Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) reported previously a correlation of UTP-induced ATP release with connexin expression in glial cells. We found a similar correlation of mechanically induced ATP release with connexin expression in C6 glioma cells. We also found that low extracellular Ca2+ and quinine evoke spontaneous ATP release and potentiate mechanically induced ATP release from astrocytes and C6 glioma cells expressing connexin43, whereas inhibitors of connexin hemichannels including FFA and Gd3+ inhibited mechanically induced ATP release. Based upon these results, we conclude that mechanically induced release of ATP involves connexin hemichannels.Modulators of connexin hemichannels had consistent effects on intercellular Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes. We have reported previously that reduction of extracellular Ca2+evokes intercellular Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes (26Zanotti S. Charles A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 594-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This finding can now be explained by the unblocking of connexin hemichannels and subsequent ATP release to mediate intercellular signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, the connexin hemichannel activator quinine evoked ATP release and intercellular Ca2+signaling in astrocytes and C6 cells expressing connexin43, and mechanically induced intercellular Ca2+ waves in astrocytes were potentiated by quinine. Conversely, the extent of intercellular Ca2+ wave propagation was significantly reduced by the same concentrations of connexin hemichannel inhibitors that inhibited whole-cell currents, transmembrane dye flux, and release of ATP.Cotrina et al. (5Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) raised the possibility of connexin hemichannels as a pathway for release of ATP and intercellular Ca2+ signaling. However, their observations that octanol did not block ATP release at concentrations sufficient to block dye coupling seemed to contradict this possibility. Our results indicate that there is a consistent correlation between modulation of connexin hemichannel currents, low molecular weight dye release, and ATP release. It is possible that inhibitors of gap junctions such as octanol act with different potency and specificity on intercellular gap junction channels versus individual connexin hemichannels. Quinine represents an example of an agent with distinct effects on connexin hemichannel function versus gap junctional coupling; although quinine activates connexin hemichannels, it does not have a parallel effect on gap junctional conductance (23White T.W. Deans M.R. O'Brien J. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Goodenough D.A. Ripps H. Bruzzone R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Malchow R.P. Qian H. Ripps H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1039-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Dixon D.B. Takahashi K. Bieda M. Copenhagen D.R. Vision Res. 1996; 36: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).We used flufenamic acid and Gd3+ as inhibitors of connexin hemichannels, because both have been shown to inhibit connexin hemichannels in oocytes with high potency (21Zhang Y. McBride Jr., D.W. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 763-776Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and neither evoked increases in [Ca2+]i. Flufenamic acid has also been reported to be a potent and reversible blocker of gap junctions (22Harks E.G. de Roos A.D. Peters P.H. de Haan L.H. Brouwer A. Ypey D.L. van Zoelen E.J. Theuvenet A.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 1033-1041PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, we found that other traditional gap junction inhibitors such as octanol, glycyrrhetinic acid, or oleamide all evoked Ca2+ signaling that included elevations of base-line Ca2+, Ca2+ oscillations, and intercellular Ca2+ waves (not shown). The mechanism for the activation of Ca2+ signaling by these agents is not known. Regardless of the mechanism, however, these increases in [Ca2+]i confounded interpretation of their effects regarding a role for connexin channels.Although both FFA and Gd3+ also inhibit other channels as well as connexin channels, their effects with multiple different assays of connexin channel function support the interpretation that their effects in the present study are primarily due to connexin channel inhibition. In addition, we found that other Cl− channel blockers such as DIDS that do not inhibit connexin hemichannels (25Dixon D.B. Takahashi K. Bieda M. Copenhagen D.R. Vision Res. 1996; 36: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,29Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) did not inhibit intercellular Ca2+ signaling or ATP release. Quinine is also well known to have effects on other ion channels. However, the activation of Ca2+ signaling only in C6 cells expressing connexin43, and not in non-transfected C6 cells, is consistent with the activation of connexin hemichannels, as has been reported previously (23White T.W. Deans M.R. O'Brien J. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Goodenough D.A. Ripps H. Bruzzone R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Malchow R.P. Qian H. Ripps H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 1039-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Dixon D.B. Takahashi K. Bieda M. Copenhagen D.R. Vision Res. 1996; 36: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) for multiple types of connexins.The correlation of results of electrophysiological studies, dye flux measurements, ATP release measurements, and imaging of intercellular Ca2+ signaling provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that intercellular Ca2+ waves in astrocytes can occur by ATP release through connexin hemichannels. The parallel results obtained only with C6 cells expressing connexin43, and not with non-transfected C6 cells, corroborates this hypothesis. A primary role for connexin hemichannels in intercellular Ca2+ signaling does not exclude other potential intercellular pathways, such as gap junctions. It is also possible that connexin expression is associated with up-regulation of some other pathway for ATP release. However, ATP release via connexin hemichannels is the most direct explanation for our results and provides a direct mechanism that reconciles both a role for connexins and a role for extracellular ATP in intercellular Ca2+ waves.Astrocyte Ca2+ waves have been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. They have been shown to modulate synaptic signaling between neurons, suggesting a role in synaptic plasticity (30Araque A. Parpura V. Sanzgiri R.P. Haydon P.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2129-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 31Parpura V. Haydon P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1800-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have provided evidence that this modulation of synaptic function is mediated by astrocytic release of glutamate, which they have shown to occur in association with Ca2+ waves. Astrocyte Ca2+ waves have also been shown to modulate the response of the retinal neurons to light stimulation (34Newman E.A. Zahs K.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4022-4028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for astrocyte Ca2+ waves has also been proposed in migraine headache and the spread of seizures (2Charles A. Glia. 1998; 24: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The identification of connexin hemichannels as a pathway for stimulus-evoked release of small molecules by our studies and others (29Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that in addition to ATP, other intercellular messengers may also be released via this pathway. Further investigation of this mechanism of intercellular signaling may provide an opportunity for greater understanding of the functional significance of Ca2+ waves in astrocytes and other cell types. Astrocytes respond to a variety of stimuli with increases in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i1(1Finkbeiner S.M. Glia. 1993; 9: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 2Charles A. Glia. 1998; 24: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).

Ca2+ wave propagation has been correlated with the expression of connexins (the proteins that comprise gap junctions) in multiple cell types.

Chem. 2000; 72: 2001-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Multiple other stimuli that evoke astrocyte signaling, including glutamate and UTP, also evoke release of ATP (5Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar, 12Queiroz G. Meyer D.K. Meyer A. Starke K. von Kugelgen I. Neuroscience. 1999; 91: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The requirement for connexins and the involvement of ATP as a messenger in astrocyte Ca2+ wave propagation seem to indicate paradoxically both gap junctional and extracellular messenger-mediated intercellular communication. However, in addition to docking with connexins in neighboring cells, connexins form “hemichannels” or “connexons” that exist independently within an individual cell (13Hofer A. Dermietzel R. Glia. 1998; 24: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 14Li H. Liu T.F. Lazrak A. Peracchia C. Goldberg G.S. Lampe P.D. Johnson R.G. J.

Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Similar to other membrane channels, connexin hemichannels are transmembrane channels that connect the cytoplasm and the extracellular space. Astrocytes in culture have been reported to express connexin hemichannels that allow transmembrane dye flux (13Hofer A. Dermietzel R. Glia. 1998; 24: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These channels may provide a pathway for release of small signaling molecules, such as ATP, to the extracellular space. Roles for both an extracellular messenger and connexins in intercellular Ca2+ signaling could therefore be reconciled by the hypothesis that the ATP that mediates Ca2+ waves is released through connexin hemichannels. Consistent with this hypothesis, Cotrina et al. (5Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) reported that ATP release from C6 glioma cells is increased in direct correlation with the level of forced connexin expression. Although these studies raised the possibility of a role for connexin channels in ATP release, they also found that ATP release was not inhibited by concentrations of octanol that were sufficient to inhibit gap junction channels as evidenced by dye coupling. Although this result would seem to contradict a direct role for connexin hemichannels in ATP release, it is possible that inhibitors of gap junctional coupling may not have the same effects or potency as inhibitors of connexin hemichannels. Bruzzone et al. (29Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) reported that transmembrane flux of NAD+ occurs via connexin43 hemichannels, indicating that the hemichannels composed of the primary astrocyte connexin are permeable to nucleotides. In the present study, we have used dye transfer and electrophysiological techniques to confirm the presence of connexin hemichannels in astrocytes. We have then used Ca2+imaging and ATP measurements to show that the extent of intercellular Ca2+ waves and ATP release in astrocytes is correlated with the function of connexin hemichannels. DISCUSSIONAstrocytes, like multiple other cell types, are capable of widespread communication via intercellular Ca2+ waves. Although initial studies (1Finkbeiner S.M. Glia. 1993; 9: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 6Charles A.C. Naus C.C. Zhu D. Kidder G.M. Dirksen E.R. Sanderson M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) identified gap junctions as a pathway for communication of Ca2+ waves, more recent studies (9Guthrie P.B. Knappenberger J. Segal M. Bennett M.V.L. Charles A.C. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 520-528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Lopez-Garcia J.C. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2835-2844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated an extracellular signaling pathway involving release of ATP and activation of purinergic receptors. Our results provide evidence that connexin hemichannels provide a pathway for this ATP release.First, we found that astrocytes express functional connexin hemichannels as evidenced by whole-cell patch clamp studies. Activation by low [Ca2+]e is characteristic of currents through connexin hemichannels (17Zampighi G.A. Loo D.D. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. McBride Jr., D.W. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 763-776Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The low [Ca2+]e-activated currents we observed in astrocytes are similar to those observed through connexin hemichannels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (17Zampighi G.A. Loo D.D. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Like connexin channel currents in oocytes, the low Ca2+-activated currents in astrocytes were reversibly inhibited by similar concentrations of flufenamic acid (21Zhang Y. McBride Jr., D.W. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 763-776Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 28Zhang D.Q. McMahon D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14754-14759Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although currents through connexin43 hemichannels have not been reported in oocyte models, our results indicate that expression of connexin43 in C6 cells results in the appearance of currents in single cells that are consistent with currents observed through gap junctions composed of connexin43.Transmembrane flux of low molecular weight dyes is a commonly used method for assessing the presence and function of connexin hemichannels. Consistent with previous reports (13Hofer A. Dermietzel R. Glia. 1998; 24: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we found that astrocytes show uptake of Calcein Blue or Lucifer Yellow, both low molecular weight dyes, but not the high molecular weight dye rhodamine dextran. In addition, we observed release of AM ester-loaded dyes in response to removal of extracellular Ca2+. Mechanical stimulation of astrocytes also evoked both uptake and release of low molecular weight dyes but not release of higher molecular weight dyes (Oregon Green BAPTA 1) or LDH. Mechanical stimulation evoked release of Calcein Blue from C6 Cx43 cells but not from non-transfected C6 cells. Dye release was inhibited by flufenamic acid and Gd3+, both of which are potent inhibitors of connexin hemichannels. In summary, the size selectivity, activation by removal of extracellular Ca2+, correlation with connexin43 expression in C6 cells, and inhibition by connexin channel inhibitors are all consistent with transmembrane dye flux via connexin hemichannels.Because intercellular Ca2+ signaling induced by mechanical stimulation and other stimuli has been associated with ATP release (5Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar,9Guthrie P.B.

Chem. 2000; 72: 2001-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we examined the role of connexin hemichannels in mechanically induced ATP release. Cotrina et al. (5Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) reported previously a correlation of UTP-induced ATP release with connexin expression in glial cells. We found a similar correlation of mechanically induced ATP release with connexin expression in C6 glioma cells. We also found that low extracellular Ca2+ and quinine evoke spontaneous ATP release and potentiate mechanically induced ATP release from astrocytes and C6 glioma cells expressing connexin43, whereas inhibitors of connexin hemichannels including FFA and Gd3+ inhibited mechanically induced ATP release. Based upon these results, we conclude that mechanically induced release of ATP involves connexin hemichannels.Modulators of connexin hemichannels had consistent effects on intercellular Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes. We have reported previously that reduction of extracellular Ca2+evokes intercellular Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes (26Zanotti S. Charles A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 594-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This finding can now be explained by the unblocking of connexin hemichannels and subsequent ATP release to mediate intercellular signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, the connexin hemichannel activator quinine evoked ATP release and intercellular Ca2+signaling in astrocytes and C6 cells expressing connexin43, and mechanically induced intercellular Ca2+ waves in astrocytes were potentiated by quinine. Conversely, the extent of intercellular Ca2+ wave propagation was significantly reduced by the same concentrations of connexin hemichannel inhibitors that inhibited whole-cell currents, transmembrane dye flux, and release of ATP.Cotrina et al. (5Cotrina M.L. Lin J.H. Alves-Rodrigues A. Liu S. Li J. Azmi-Ghadimi H. Kang J. Naus C.C. Nedergaard M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15735-15740Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) raised the possibility of connexin hemichannels as a pathway for release of ATP and intercellular Ca2+ signaling. However, their observations that octanol did not block ATP release at concentrations sufficient to block dye coupling seemed to contradict this possibility. Our results indicate that there is a consistent correlation between modulation of connexin hemichannel currents, low molecular weight dye release, and ATP release. It is possible that inhibitors of gap junctions such as octanol act with different potency and specificity on intercellular gap junction channels versus individual connexin hemichannels. Quinine represents an example of an agent with distinct effects on connexin hemichannel function versus gap junctional coupling; although quinine activates connexin hemichannels, it does not have a parallel effect on gap junctional conductance (23White T.W.

Vision Res. 1996; 36: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).We used flufenamic acid and Gd3+ as inhibitors of connexin hemichannels, because both have been shown to inhibit connexin hemichannels in oocytes with high potency (21Zhang Y. McBride Jr., D.W. Hamill O.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 763-776Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and neither evoked increases in [Ca2+]i. Flufenamic acid has also been reported to be a potent and reversible blocker of gap junctions (22Harks E.G. de Roos A.D. Peters P.H. de Haan L.H. Brouwer A. Ypey D.L. van Zoelen E.J. Theuvenet A.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 1033-1041PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, we found that other traditional gap junction inhibitors such as octanol, glycyrrhetinic acid, or oleamide all evoked Ca2+ signaling that included elevations of base-line Ca2+, Ca2+ oscillations, and intercellular Ca2+ waves (not shown). The mechanism for the activation of Ca2+ signaling by these agents is not known. Regardless of the mechanism, however, these increases in [Ca2+]i confounded interpretation of their effects regarding a role for connexin channels.Although both FFA and Gd3+ also inhibit other channels as well as connexin channels, their effects with multiple different assays of connexin channel function support the interpretation that their effects in the present study are primarily due to connexin channel inhibition. In addition, we found that other Cl− channel blockers such as DIDS that do not inhibit connexin hemichannels (25Dixon D.B. Takahashi K. Bieda M. Copenhagen D.R. Vision Res. 1996; 36: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,29Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) did not inhibit intercellular Ca2+ signaling or ATP release. Quinine is also well known to have effects on other ion channels. However, the activation of Ca2+ signaling only in C6 cells expressing connexin43, and not in non-transfected C6 cells, is consistent with the activation of connexin hemichannels, as has been reported previously (23White T.W. Deans M.R. O'Brien J. Al-Ubaidi M.R. Goodenough D.A. Ripps H. Bruzzone R. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Malchow R.P. Qian H. Ripps H. J. Gen.

Vision Res. 1996; 36: 3925-3931Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) for multiple types of connexins.The correlation of results of electrophysiological studies, dye flux measurements, ATP release measurements, and imaging of intercellular Ca2+ signaling provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that intercellular Ca2+ waves in astrocytes can occur by ATP release through connexin hemichannels. The parallel results obtained only with C6 cells expressing connexin43, and not with non-transfected C6 cells, corroborates this hypothesis. A primary role for connexin hemichannels in intercellular Ca2+ signaling does not exclude other potential intercellular pathways, such as gap junctions. It is also possible that connexin expression is associated with up-regulation of some other pathway for ATP release. However, ATP release via connexin hemichannels is the most direct explanation for our results and provides a direct mechanism that reconciles both a role for connexins and a role for extracellular ATP in intercellular Ca2+ waves.Astrocyte Ca2+ waves have been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. They have been shown to modulate synaptic signaling between neurons, suggesting a role in synaptic plasticity (30Araque A. Parpura V. Sanzgiri R.P. Haydon P.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2129-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 31Parpura V. Haydon P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1800-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have provided evidence that this modulation of synaptic function is mediated by astrocytic release of glutamate, which they have shown to occur in association with Ca2+ waves. Astrocyte Ca2+ waves have also been shown to modulate the response of the retinal neurons to light stimulation (34Newman E.A. Zahs K.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4022-4028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for astrocyte Ca2+ waves has also been proposed in migraine headache and the spread of seizures (2Charles A. Glia. 1998; 24: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The identification of connexin hemichannels as a pathway for stimulus-evoked release of small molecules by our studies and others (29Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that in addition to ATP, other intercellular messengers may also be released via this pathway. Further investigation of this mechanism of intercellular signaling may provide an opportunity for greater understanding of the functional significance of Ca2+ waves in astrocytes and other cell types. Astrocytes, like multiple other cell types, are capable of widespread communication via intercellular Ca2+ waves. Although initial studies (1Finkbeiner S.M.

The correlation of results of electrophysiological studies, dye flux measurements, ATP release measurements, and imaging of intercellular Ca2+ signaling provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that intercellular Ca2+ waves in astrocytes can occur by ATP release through connexin hemichannels. The parallel results obtained only with C6 cells expressing connexin43, and not with non-transfected C6 cells, corroborates this hypothesis. A primary role for connexin hemichannels in intercellular Ca2+ signaling does not exclude other potential intercellular pathways, such as gap junctions. It is also possible that connexin expression is associated with up-regulation of some other pathway for ATP release. However, ATP release via connexin hemichannels is the most direct explanation for our results and provides a direct mechanism that reconciles both a role for connexins and a role for extracellular ATP in intercellular Ca2+ waves. Astrocyte Ca2+ waves have been implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. They have been shown to modulate synaptic signaling between neurons, suggesting a role in synaptic plasticity (30Araque A. Parpura V. Sanzgiri R.P. Haydon P.G. Eur. J.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1800-1808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have provided evidence that this modulation of synaptic function is mediated by astrocytic release of glutamate, which they have shown to occur in association with Ca2+ waves. Astrocyte Ca2+ waves have also been shown to modulate the response of the retinal neurons to light stimulation (34Newman E.A. Zahs K.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4022-4028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for astrocyte Ca2+ waves has also been proposed in migraine headache and the spread of seizures (2Charles A. Glia. 1998; 24: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The identification of connexin hemichannels as a pathway for stimulus-evoked release of small molecules by our studies and others (29Bruzzone S. Guida L. Zocchi E. Franco L. De Flora A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 10-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that in addition to ATP, other intercellular messengers may also be released via this pathway. Further investigation of this mechanism of intercellular signaling may provide an opportunity for greater understanding of the functional significance of Ca2+ waves in astrocytes and other cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1967286688,"The nuclear receptors LXRα and LXRβ have been implicated in the control of lipogenesis and cholesterol homeostasis. Ligand activation of these receptors in vivoinduces expression of the LXR target gene SREBP-1c and increases plasma triglyceride levels. Expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS), a central enzyme in de novo lipogenesis and an established target of the SREBP-1 pathway, is also induced by LXR ligands. The effects of LXR ligands on FAS expression have been proposed to be entirely secondary to the induction of SREBP-1c. We demonstrate here that LXRs regulate FAS expression through direct interaction with the FAS promoter as well as through activation of SREBP-1c expression. Induction of FAS expression in HepG2 cells by LXR ligands is reduced, but not abolished, under conditions where SREBP processing is suppressed. Moreover, LXR ligands induce FAS expression in CHO-7 cells without altering expression of SREBP-1. We demonstrate that in addition to tandem SREBP sites, the FASpromoter contains a high affinity binding site for the LXR/RXR heterodimer that is conserved in diverse animal species including birds, rodents, and humans. The LXR and SREBP binding sites independently confer LXR responsiveness on the FASpromoter, and maximal induction requires both transcription factors. Transient elevation of plasma triglyceride levels in mice treated with a synthetic LXR agonist correlates with transient induction of hepatic FAS expression. These results indicate that the LXR signaling pathway modulates FAS expression through distinct but complementary mechanisms and suggest that the FAS gene may be a critical target in the control of lipogenesis by LXRs."

Currently, diagnosis of allergy is performed by provocation testing and IgE serology using allergen extracts. This process defines allergen-containing sources but cannot identify the disease-eliciting allergenic molecules. We have applied microarray technology to develop a miniaturized allergy test containing 94 purified allergen molecules that represent the most common allergen sources. The allergen microarray allows the determination and monitoring of allergic patients' IgE reactivity profiles to large numbers of disease-causing allergens by using single measurements and minute amounts of serum. This method may change established practice in allergy diagnosis, prevention, and therapy. In addition, microarrayed antigens may be applied to the diagnosis of autoimmune and infectious diseases."

A protein has been purified from rabbit liver cytosol that catalyzes the methylation of both arsenite and methylarsonous acid (10.Zakharyan R. Wu Y. Bogdan G.M. Aposhian H.V. Chem. Res.

These activities are designated arsenite methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.137) and methylarsonite methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.138), respectively. This protein (estimated molecular mass 60 kDa) uses S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) as the methyl group donor. The methylation of arsenite by this protein is stimulated by a monothiol (GSH) and the methylation of methylarsonous acid is highly stimulated by a dithiol, dithiothreitol (DTT). pentavalent arsenic S-adenosyl-l-methionine trivalent arsenic glutathione dithiothreitol arsenite methylarsine oxide reverse transcription The methylation of arsenic has been commonly regarded as a mechanism for its detoxification (12.Yamauchi H.

However, recent research has shown that methylated arsenicals that contain AsIII are important intermediates in the metabolism of inorganic arsenic. Methylated arsenicals that contain AsIII are found in the urine of individuals who chronically consume drinking water that contains inorganic arsenic and in cells cultured in the presence of arsenite (13.Aposhian H.V.

Toxicol. 2001; 14: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the methylation process can be properly regarded as a means for the activation of inorganic arsenic to more reactive and toxic species. Consequently, characterization of enzymes that catalyze formation of methylated arsenicals is an important step in understanding the consequences of chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic. Although there are extensive data on the kinetics of formation of methylated arsenicals in in vitro systems containing crude cytosolic preparations or purified enzyme, in cultured cells, and in intact animals, little is known about the properties of the enzymes that catalyze the methylation reactions. The work reported here describes the purification of a novel protein from rat liver cytosol that catalyzes the time-dependent formation of methylated and dimethylated arsenicals in reaction mixtures that contain the purified protein, arsenite, GSH, DTT, and AdoMet. Mass spectrometric sequencing of peptides generated from this protein indicates a high degree of homology with Cyt19, a putative methyltransferase of unknown function that is expressed in mouse and human tissues. Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on the amino acid sequence of peptides from the purified protein, the complete nucleotide sequence of the mRNA encoding the protein has been determined. This novel protein is designated S-adenosyl-l-methionine:arsenic(III) methyltransferase. The mRNA for the protein is expressed in a variety of rat tissues and in HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line. However, it is not expressed in UROtsa cells, an SV40 large T antigen-immortalized human urothelial line (27.Petzoldt J.L. Leigh I.M. Duffy P.G. Sexton C. Masters J.R.W. Urol. Res. 1995; 23: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), that do not methylate inorganic arsenic. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were obtained from Sigma. HepG2 cells were obtained from ATCC and UROtsa cells were obtained from Dr. N. Unimye, Department of Urology, School of Medicine, West Virginia University. Radiolabeled arsenite ([73As]iAsIII) was prepared by the procedure of Reay and Asher (28.Reay P.F. Asher C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) from radiolabeled arsenate [73As]iAsV obtained from the Los Alamos Meson Production Facility (Los Alamos, NM). The methylated arsenical, methylarsine oxide (MAsIIIO), was synthesized and characterized as previously described (22.Styblo M. Serves S.V. Cullen W.R. Thomas D.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Male Fischer 344 rats (4 to 6 weeks old) from Charles River Laboratories were maintained in a 12-h light, 12-h dark photocycle at 21 ± 2 °C with free access to PMI 5001 Rodent Chow (PMI Nutrition International) and tap water. Rats were euthanized by cardiac exsanguination under nembutal anesthesia. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Livers were perfused in situ with 154 mm NaCl, removed, blotted, and weighed. Pooled livers (up to 150 g) were homogenized in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 5 mm GSH, 1 mm DTT, and 250 mm sucrose, pH 8.3, at a tissue-to-buffer ratio of 1:5 (w/v) using a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 45 min to prepare a cytosolic fraction. After removal of the lipid layer, the cytosolic fraction was adjusted to pH 5 by dropwise addition of 1m acetic acid. The acidified cytosol was immediately centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min; the supernatant was removed and adjusted to pH 8.3 by the dropwise addition of 1m ammonium hydroxide. The treated supernatant could be stored overnight at 4 °C without loss of arsenic methyltransferase activity. Treated supernatant was chromatofocused on a column of Polybuffer Exchanger PBE94 gel (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) that was eluted with Polybuffer 96 diluted 1:9 (v/v) in 25 mm Tris, 5 mm GSH, and 1 mm DTT, pH 6. The arsenic methylating activities of eluate fractions were assessed using a thin layer chromatography (TLC) method for the separation of73As-labeled products. Briefly, [73As]iAsIII (final concentration 0.1 μm AsIII) and 1 mm AdoMet were added to aliquots of eluate fractions and reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for up to 120 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.2 m CuCl and heating to 100 °C for 5 min (29.Styblo M. Hughes M.F. Thomas D.J. J. Chromatog. B. 1996; 677: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Denatured proteins were removed by centrifugation and supernatants were oxidized with H2O2 (final concentration 10%). Aliquots of oxidized supernatants were analyzed by TLC as previously described (30.Styblo M. Delnomdedieu M. Hughes M.F. Thomas D.J. J. Chromatog. B. 1995; 668: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fractions that contained the highest levels of the activity that converted arsenite to methylated and dimethylated products were pooled and applied to a column of an S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine-Sepharose affinity gel that was prepared by the method of Reeve and co-workers (31.Reeve A.M. Breazeale S.D. Townsend C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30695-30703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The chromatographic gel was fully equilibrated with 50 mm Na phosphate buffer containing 5 mm GSH, 1 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4. After application of high activity fractions, the gel bed was washed with 5 column volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 5 mm GSH, 1 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4. The arsenite methylating activity was eluted by addition of 1 mm AdoMet to the eluting buffer. Fractions containing the highest arsenic methylating activity were pooled and stored at −20 °C. The enzyme-catalyzed conversion of methylarsine oxide to dimethylated arsenic was examined by the method of Zhang and associates (32.Zhang X. Cornelis R. de Kimpe J. Mees L. J. Anal. Atomic Spectrom. 1996; 11: 1075-1096Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Aliquots of reaction mixtures were chromatographed on an anion-exchange column (Supelcosil LC-SAX, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, Supelco) using 30 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 4.5, as the mobile phase (1 ml/min). Arsines of the separated species were generated and detected using a Millennium Excalibur atomic fluorescence spectrometer (PS Analytical, Kent, England). SDS-PAGE of pooled active fractions from S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine-Sepharose affinity chromatography identified one Coomassie Blue-reactive band. This band was excised from the gel, transferred to a siliconized tube, and was washed and destained overnight in 200 μl of 50% methanol. Gel pieces were then dehydrated in acetonitrile and rehydrated in 30 μl of 10 mm DTT in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. After reduction for 30 min at room temperature, the DTT-containing solution was removed and the sample was alkylated in 30 μl of 50 mm iodoacetamide in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min at room temperature. The alkylating mixture was removed and the gel pieces were dehydrated in 100 μl of acetonitrile. After removal of the acetonitrile, the gel pieces were rehydrated in 100 μl of 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Gel pieces were again dehydrated in 100 μl of acetonitrile. After removal of the acetonitrile, gel pieces were fully dried by vacuum centrifugation. Dried gel pieces were rehydrated on ice for 10 min in a solution containing 20 μg of trypsin/ml in 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate. Excess trypsin-containing solution was removed and an additional 20 μl of 0.05 m ammonium bicarbonate was added. This sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted from the polyacrylamide gel matrix with two 30-μl aliquots of 50% acetonitrile in 5% formic acid. Extracts were combined and evaporated to a volume of 25 μl for further analysis. The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system consisted of a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer with a Protana nanospray ion source that was interfaced with a self-packed Phenomenex Jupiter 10 μm C18 reversed-phase capillary column (8 cm × 75 μm inner diameter). Samples of the extract (0.5 to 5 μl) were injected on the column that was eluted with an acetonitrile, 0.1 m acetic acid gradient at a flow rate of 0.25 μl/min. The nanospray ion source operated at 2.8 kV. The extracts were analyzed using the instrument's double play capability. Here, full scan mass spectra were acquired to determine the molecular weights of peptides and product ion spectra were acquired to determine the amino acid sequence in sequential scans. This mode of analysis yields about 400 CAD spectra of ions that range in abundance over several orders of magnitude. Data were analyzed by data base searching using the Sequest search algorithm. Peptides that were not matched by this algorithm were interpreted manually and searched in the EST data bases using the Sequest algorithm. Total RNA was isolated from the livers of adult male Fischer 344 rat using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was treated with DNase (Invitrogen) and cDNA was made using Promega Reverse Transcriptase System. A set of degenerate oligonucleotide primers for use in polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were designed on the basis of the translation of peptide sequences from S-adenosyl-l-methionine:arsenic(III) methyltransferase. With these primers, the cDNA was amplified using Hot Start PCR and Ampli Taq Gold enzyme (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). PCR products were purified using QIAquick PCR purification. A 900-base sequence was obtained and was sequenced at the UNC-CH Automated DNA Sequencing Facility on a Model 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using the ABI PrismTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. Using this sequence information, the sequences of the 5′ and 3′ ends were obtained using the GeneRacer system (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNAs were sequenced, providing the entire mRNA sequence. Adult male Fischer 344 rats were euthanized by cardiac exsanguination under nembutal anesthesia. Tissues were quickly harvested, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −65 °C. RNA was also isolated from two human cell lines. HepG2 cells were grown in an amended Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g of glucose and 110 mg of sodium pyruvate per liter) with 15% fetal bovine serum and UROtsa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. RNA was isolated from both cell lines using Trizol reagent. RNA was treated with DNase (Promega) and further purified with an RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen). mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA which was used for PCR reactions for detection of S-adenosyl-l-methionine:arsenic(III) methyltransferase and β-actin. PCR was performed on a PerkinElmer Geneamp 9700 thermal cycler and PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. A combination of acid treatment of cytosol, chromatofocusing, and affinity chromatography on an S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine-Sepharose gel column allowed 9300-fold enrichment of S-adenosyl-l-methionine:arsenic(III) methyltransferase activity from rat liver cytosol (Table I). Notably, the total activity of S-adenosyl-l-methionine:arsenic(III) methyltransferase recovered in this purification scheme increased as the specific activity of the fractions increased. The enhanced yield may reflect removal of an endogenous inhibitor of the enzyme's activity in the purification scheme or an altered ratio of enzyme to DTT as purification progresses. A critical factor in the success of this purification scheme was inclusion of GSH and DTT in all buffers. Earlier work demonstrated that GSH was critical to the maintenance of arsenic methylating activity in an in vitro reaction system that contained rat liver cytosol (33.Buchet J.P. Lauwerys R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3149-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34.Styblo M. Delnomdedieu M. Thomas D.J. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1996; 99: 147-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and that DTT promoted the dimethylation reaction catalyzed by the purified rabbit liver protein (10.Zakharyan R. Wu Y. Bogdan G.M. Aposhian H.V. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1995; 8: 1029-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). S-Adenosyl-l-homocysteine-Sepharose affinity chromatography yielded a single Coomassie Blue staining band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1).

Open table in a new tab Fig. 2A illustrates the time course of the production of methylated and dimethylated arsenicals in a system that contained 25 μg of enzyme, 0.1 μm[73As]iAsIII, 1 mm AdoMet, 5 mm GSH, and 1 mm DTT in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer with 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4. Here, incubation at 37 °C for intervals up to 120 min lead to the appearance of both methylated species. Notably, the appearance of methylated arsenic preceded the appearance of dimethylated arsenical. This pattern was consistent with the stepwise formation of73As-labeled methylated arsenic from [73As]iAsIII and of 73As-labeled dimethylated arsenic from 73As-labeled methylated arsenic. A three-compartment kinetic model with the structure shown in Fig. 2A was constructed using SAAMII (version 1.1.1), a program for compartmental analysis (SAAM Institute, University of Washington). This model provided estimates of the overall rates for the appearance of methylated and dimethylated arsenic in this assay system. Based on the reduction in the residual sum of squares, k2,1 was estimated as 0.00443% per minute and k3,2 as 0.183% per minute. Under similar conditions, neither arsenate (AsV) nor methylarsonic (AsV) acid was methylated (data not shown). In other studies, the conversion of MAsIIIO to dimethylated arsenic was assessed using anion exchange chromatography-hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry to quantify the substrate and the product. Here, reaction mixtures contained up to 5 μm MAsIIIO, 25 μg of purified enzyme, 0.2 mm AdoMet, 5 mm GSH, and 1 mm DTT in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, with 5% (v/v) glycerol. Following incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, reactions were stopped by snap freezing on dry ice and stored at −20 °C. A double-reciprocal plot of the dependence of the reaction rate on the concentration of methylarsine oxide is shown in Fig. 2B. This analysis yielded an estimated Km of 250 nm and a Vmax of 68 pmol/mg of protein per min. The activity of the purified S-adenosyl-l-methionine:arsenic(III) methyltransferase was dependent on the concentration of AdoMet in the reaction mixture. Because buffer containing 1 mm AdoMet was used to elute the enzyme from S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine-Sepharose gel, the pooled active fraction in AdoMet-containing buffer was dialyzed against 50 mm Na phosphate buffer containing 5 mm GSH, 1 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4, using dialysis tubing with a nominal molecular weight cutoff of 12,000. The dialysate was used in a reaction mixture that contained 25 μg of enzyme, 0.1 μm [73As]iAsIII, 5 mm GSH, 1 mm DTT, and up to 1000 μm AdoMet in 50 mm Na phosphate buffer with 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4. Following a 12-min incubation at 37 °C, reaction mixtures were processed for analysis of methylated arsenicals. Fig. 3A shows the influence of AdoMet concentration on the extent of methylation of arsenic. Maximal conversion of arsenic to methylated products occurred at 50 μm AdoMet; yield fell at higher AdoMet concentrations. In the absence of added AdoMet, methylated arsenicals were not detected in reaction mixtures (data not shown). The pH dependence of the arsenic methylating activity of the protein was examined over the pH range of 5 to 11 (Fig. 3B). Here, 2.5 μg of purified enzyme in 50 mm Na phosphate buffer containing 0.1 μm[73As]iAsIII, 5 mm GSH, 1 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.4, was diluted into 95 μl of buffer at the desired final pH. AdoMet concentration was 50 μm in the final reaction mixture. Substantial activity was found between pH 7.5 and 10 with peak activity at pH 9.5. Mass spectrometry of the purified protein provide 15 unique peptide sequences (Table II). BLASTP analysis found a high degree of identity between these peptides and the predicted sequences of two proteins (NCB accession number NP065602 and NP05733). These proteins of mouse and human origin, respectively, have been provisionally identified as methyltransferases and designated as Cyt19. Using peptide sequence data, a set of degenerate oligonucleotide primers was designed for PCR and subsequent sequencing of the products (Table III). Based on initial sequence results, additional oligonucleotide primers were synthesized to complete the sequencing of the full-length cDNA. The sequence of the full-length cDNA for S-adenosyl-l-methionine:arsenic(III) methyltransferase and its conceptual translation are shown in Table IV. The predicted protein contains 369 amino acids and has a calculated molecular mass of 41,056.Table IIAmino acid sequences of peptides generated by the trypsin digestion of purified S-adenosyl-l-methionine:arsenic (III) methyltransferase as determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometryPeptideMeasured molecular mass (M+H+, Da)Sequence1729.2 +2DLAVIAK2827.8 +2FVSATFR3833.3 +2GVPEYIR4846.4 +2IGFCPPR5878.2 +2YXNEVXK6974.5 +2ILDLGSGSGR71088.5 +2GHXTGIDM(o)TK81242.7 +2LVTANIITVGNK91312.6 +2DVQNYYGNVLK101344.7 +2ELIFDANFTFK111409.7 +3DCYVLSQLVGKK121410.7 +3SLQNVHEEVXSR131608.7 +3CKVVYDGGI—K141731.2 +2EGEAVEVDEETAAXLR152232.2 +3FAHDFLFTPVEASLXAA— Open table in a new tab Table IIIPeptide sequences and oligonucleotide primersNameDescriptionSequencemtf1FPeptideQNYYGNVLKOligonucleotide (5′ → 3′)RAAYTAYGGNAAYGTNYTNAAaDegeneracies indicated as R = A + G, Y = C + T, M = A + C, K = G + T, S = G + C, W = A + T, H = A + T + C, N = A + C + G + T.mtf2FPeptideSLQNVHEEOligonucleotideWSNYTNCARAAYGTNCAYGARGARmtf3FPeptideILDLGSGSOligonucleotideATHYTNGAYYTNGGNWSNGGNWSNmtf4FPeptideFCPPRLVTOligonucleotideTYTGYCCNCCNMGNYTNGTNACNmtf5FOligonucleotideAAGTGGATGAGGAGACGGCAGmtf6FOligonucleotideGGTGGCTAAAGGGCAGTCACAAmtf7FOligonucleotideTTCAGAGTTCTGGCGCCACCTAmtf1RPeptideLSAEVPTFOligonucleotideARNSWNGCYTCNACNGGNGTRAAmtf2RPeptideAATEEDVEOligonucleotideNGCNGCNGTYTCYTCRTCNACYTCmtf3RPeptideTVLRPPCFOligonucleotideNGTNACNARNCKNGGNGGRCARAmtf-4ROligonucleotideAGCCACTTCCACCTGGACCTTApoly dTOligonucleotideTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTa Degeneracies indicated as R = A + G, Y = C + T, M = A + C, K = G + T, S = G + C, W = A + T, H = A + T + C, N = A + C + G + T.

In HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, this mRNA was detected after 35 or 45 cycles of amplification. However, in UROtsa cells, an immortalized cell line derived from normal human urothelium, S-adenosyl-l-methionine:arsenic(III) methyltransferase mRNA was not detected after 45 cycles of amplification (Fig. 4B). Notably, both sets of forward and reverse primers amplified mRNA in rat tissues and in HepG2 cells and failed to amplify mRNA in UROtsa cells. The results shown for rat tissues and HepG2 cells are for the primer sets that gave maximal amplification.

https://openalex.org/W2170598964,"Control and treatment of chronic pain remain major clinical challenges. Progress may be facilitated by a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain processing. Here we show that the calcium-sensing protein DREAM is a transcriptional repressor involved in modulating pain. dream−/− mice displayed markedly reduced responses in models of acute thermal, mechanical, and visceral pain. dream−/− mice also exhibited reduced pain behaviors in models of chronic neuropathic and inflammatory pain. However, dream−/− mice showed no major defects in motor function or learning and memory. Mice lacking DREAM had elevated levels of prodynorphin mRNA and dynorphin A peptides in the spinal cord, and the reduction of pain behaviors in dream−/− mice was mediated through dynorphin-selective kappa (κ)-opiate receptors. Thus, DREAM appears to be a critical transcriptional repressor in pain processing."
https://openalex.org/W2091663316,"Plakophilins are a subfamily of p120-related arm-repeat proteins that can be found in both desmosomes and the nucleus. Among the three known plakophilin members, plakophilin 1 has been linked to a genetic skin disorder and shown to play important roles in desmosome assembly and organization. However, little is known about the binding partners and functions of the most widely expressed member, plakophilin 2. To better understand the cellular functions of plakophilin 2, we have examined its protein interactions with other junctional molecules using co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assays. Here we show that plakophilin 2 can interact directly with several desmosomal components, including desmoplakin, plakoglobin, desmoglein 1 and 2, and desmocollin 1a and 2a. The head domain of plakophilin 2 is critical for most of these interactions and is sufficient to direct plakophilin 2 to cell borders. In addition, plakophilin 2 is less efficient than plakophilin 1 in localizing to the nucleus and enhancing the recruitment of excess desmoplakin to cell borders in transiently transfected COS cells. Furthermore, plakophilin 2 is able to associate with β-catenin through its head domain, and the expression of plakophilin 2 in SW480 cells up-regulates the endogenous β-catenin/T cell factor-signaling activity. This up-regulation by plakophilin 2 is abolished by ectopic expression of E-cadherin, suggesting that these proteins compete for the same pool of signaling active β-catenin. Our results demonstrate that plakophilin 2 interacts with a broader repertoire of desmosomal components than plakophilin 1 and provide new insight into the possible roles of plakophilin 2 in regulating the signaling activity of β-catenin.

Each is composed of a basic N-terminal head domain followed by a series of 10 imperfect 42-amino acid repeats (arm repeats) and a short C-terminal tail (3Bonne S. van Hengel J. Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2265-2276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two splice variants have been identified for PKP1 and PKP2, a shorter “a” form and a longer “b” form. Although the N-terminal head domains of PKPs exhibit relatively greater sequence diversity than the arm-repeat domains, a consensus sequence termed HR2 is shared by all the PKP head domains (3Bonne S. van Hengel J. Nollet F. Kools P. van Roy F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2265-2276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schmidt A. Langbein L. Pratzel S. Rode M. Rackwitz H.R. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1999; 64: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). PKP1 is concentrated in desmosomes of the suprabasal layers of stratified and complex epithelia (5Schmidt A. Langbein L. Rode M. Pratzel S. Zimbelmann R. Franke W.W. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 290: 481-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). PKP3 can be detected in desmosomes of most simple and almost all stratified epithelia with the exception of hepatocytes and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (3Bonne S. van Hengel J. Nollet F.

PKP2 has the broadest tissue distribution in desmosomes of all simple, complex, and stratified epithelia as well as non-epithelial tissues such as myocardium and lymph node follicles, in which PKP1 was not detected in desmosomes. PKP2 is concentrated in the basal layer of most stratified squamous epithelia, whereas PKP1 is mostly concentrated in desmosomes of the upper layers (2Mertens C. Kuhn C. Franke W.W. J.

PKPs have been detected in both desmosomes and nuclei in desmosome-possessing cells and only in nuclei in desmosome-lacking cells, but the mechanisms responsible for this dual location and their functions in these two different environments are still poorly understood.Members of the armadillo family, to which PKPs belong, play critical structural and regulatory roles through their interactions with proteins in two related intercellular adhesive junctions, desmosomes and adherens junctions, which anchor intermediate filament (IF) networks and actin filaments to sites of cell-cell contact (7Cowin P. Burke B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 8Garrod D. Chidgey M. North A. Curr. Opin.

The best characterized interactions of the desmosomal armadillo proteins are those in which plakoglobin (Pg) participates. Pg associates directly with the cytoplasmic domains of the desmosomal cadherins, transmembrane glycoproteins of desmosomes that are further subdivided into the desmoglein (Dsg) and desmocollin (Dsc) subfamilies. Three isoforms exist for each of these subfamilies, which are expressed in a cell type- and differentiation-dependent manner (8Garrod D. Chidgey M. North A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 670-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 11Buxton R.S. Cowin P. Franke W.W. Garrod D.R. Green K.J. King I.A. Koch P.J. Magee A.I. Rees D.A. Stanley J.R. J.

Plakoglobin links desmosomal cadherins to IF through its interactions with the plakin family member desmoplakin (DP). Functionally, loss of Pg function through mutation or genetic ablation leads to heart and skin defects, supporting the fact that this link between the cadherins and the IF-desmoplakin complex plays a key role in tissue integrity (13Ruiz P. Brinkmann V. Ledermann B. Behrend M. Grund C. Thalhammer C. Vogel F. Birchmeier C. Gunthert U. Franke W.W. Birchmeier W. J.

Whereas DP in normal epidermis is concentrated in desmosomes, this plaque protein exhibits a largely diffuse, cytoplasmic distribution in PKP1 null patients. This observation raises the possibility that PKP1 is required for the efficient association of DP with the junctional plaque. Subsequent studies provided evidence supporting this hypothesis, showing that PKP1 can directly interact with the DP N terminus and enhance its recruitment to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, PKP1 collaborates with Pg and DP to promote the clustering of desmosomal plaque complexes at cell-cell borders and to enhance IF association with the plaque (17Bornslaeger E.A.

Together, these results have led to the proposal that PKP1 is important in strengthening the desmosomal plaque by enhancing lateral protein-protein interactions. However, virtually nothing is known about the roles of other PKPs in desmosomes and how their participation in desmosomes affects the specific organization or functions of desmosomes in different tissues and stages of differentiation.In addition to their function in intercellular junctions, some armadillo family members also play roles in cellular activities outside of the junctions. Both Pg (20Simcha I. Shtutman M. Salomon D. Zhurinsky J. Sadot E. Geiger B. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and p120 (21van Hengel J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar); however, the best-studied example is β-catenin. This close relative of Pg connects the cytoplasmic tails of classical cadherins with actin-binding proteins such as α-catenin to provide the linkage between actin filaments and adherens junctions (27Jou T.S. Stewart D.B. Stappert J. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Besides its important roles in cell-cell adhesion, β-catenin is a critical downstream effector of the Wnt-signaling pathway, which mediates a large variety of developmental processes (28Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 29Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). The cellular level of β-catenin is tightly controlled by a complex of proteins that facilitates its rapid degradation, whereas activation of the Wnt-signaling pathway antagonizes the degradation process and leads to the accumulation of free, cytoplasmic β-catenin. β-Catenin can then translocate into the nucleus and activate target gene transcription in association with TCF/Lef1 transcription factors (30Dierick H. Bejsovec A. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 153-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Since the recognition of its role in Wnt signaling, an increasing number of proteins have been discovered to interact with β-catenin and regulate its signaling activity through various mechanisms (31Zhurinsky J. Shtutman M. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3127-3139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKPs, like their armadillo family relatives, are also found in the nucleus. So far evidence for participation of PKPs in β-catenin-dependent signaling has not been reported. A recent study showed that nuclear PKP2 is complexed with the RNA polymerase III holoenzyme and interacts directly with its largest subunit RPC155 in vitro, opening up additional possibilities for the nuclear activity of PKP2 (32Mertens C. Hofmann I. Wang Z. Teichmann M. Chong S.S. Schnolzer M. Franke W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7795-7800Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, because only a subset of PKP2 was observed in these complexes, other nuclear functions for this arm-repeat subfamily of proteins may exist.PKP2 is the most ubiquitously expressed PKP family member, suggesting that it has broad cellular functions. In this study, to elucidate the biological functions of PKP2, we have characterized its protein interactions with other junctional molecules. Here we show that PKP2 interacts directly with the obligate desmosome components Pg and DP as well as the desmosomal cadherins Dsg1, Dsg2, Dsc1a, and Dsc2a and may interact indirectly with Dsg3. PKP2 is less efficient than PKP1 in enhancing the recruitment of excess DP to cell borders, which is consistent with the weaker interaction observed between PKP2 and DP and indicates distinct roles for these two PKPs in desmosome assembly. In addition, PKP2 can associate with non-cadherin-bound β-catenin and regulate its signaling activity in TOPFLASH reporter assays. This novel association with a component of adherens junctions and the Wnt-signaling pathway raises the possibility that PKP2 might participate in cross-talk between the two major types of intercellular junctions and signal transduction pathways connecting the cell surface and the nucleus.DISCUSSIONPKPs represent a family of arm-repeat proteins present in both desmosomes and the nucleus. Commonly found in stratified and complex epithelia, PKPs exhibit cell type- and differentiation-dependent patterns of desmosomal localization, suggesting distinct roles in the regulation and function of desmosomes. Their constitutive nuclear localization independent of their presence in desmosomes points to possible novel functions in the nucleus. The identification of human patients bearing PKP1 gene mutations has provided compelling evidence for its critical involvement in organizing and stabilizing desmosomes and further catalyzed the study on its role in desmosomes. However, little is known about the function of its most widely expressed relative, PKP2. In the present study, we investigated the ability of PKP2a to interact with other junctional molecules and conducted functional analyses on its role in desmosome formation and regulation of β-catenin-signaling activity.PKP1a has been shown to interact directly with DP, Dsg1, and keratin (18Hatzfeld M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18145-18148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We showed here by co-immunoprecipitation from co-transfected cells that PKP2a associates with DP, Pg, Dsg1, and Dsg2. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated furthermore that interactions with DP, Pg, Dsg1, and possibly Dsg2 are direct and further uncovered Dsc1a and 2a as PKP2a interaction partners. Pg co-precipitated with PKP2a and the deletion of either the N-terminal head or C-terminal tail of Pg failed to abrogate this interaction, suggesting that it is primarily mediated by the arm-repeat domain of Pg. Intriguingly, the association between Pg and PKP2a was further enhanced by deletion of the Pg C-terminal end domain. Previous work showed that PgΔC expression in A431 cells caused formation of longer desmosomes or groups of tandemly linked desmosomes that were still attached to keratin intermediate filaments (34Palka H.L. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was proposed that deletion of the Pg C terminus might enhance interactions with other desmosomal components and lead to generation of longer desmosomes. Together with our data, it thus seems possible that enhanced interaction between PgΔC and PKP2a could contribute to the effect on desmosome morphology previously attributed to PgΔC expression.PKP2a co-immunoprecipitated Dsg1 and Dsg2, but not Dsg3 in co-transfected COS cells, and its interaction with Dsg1 was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assays as being directly mediated by the PKP2a head domain. It is unclear why we detected a direct interaction between the Dsg2 cytoplasmic domain and the PKP2a head domain but not full-length PKP2a in yeast two-hybrid assays, but it seems likely that a direct binding site for Dsg2 is contained in the head domain of PKP2a in light of the abilities of both PKP2a and PKP2a-H to co-precipitate Dsg2 in transfected cells. The fact that increasing the level of cellular Pg does not enhance the association between PKP2a and Dsg2 (Fig.5 B) is consistent with the hypothesis that Pg does not interact with PKP2a and Dsg2 simultaneously. The binding sites in Pg for Dsg1 and Dsc1a reside in its arm-repeat domain (40Wahl J.K. Sacco P.A. McGranahan-Sadler T.M. Sauppe L.M. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), as does the binding site for PKP2a as we show here. Thus, it is possible that desmosomal cadherins and PKP2a compete with each other for binding to Pg. How the observed direct interactions discussed here translate into the formation of the physiological complexes in cells may depend on other factors, including the availability of specific protein partners in specific cell types. For instance, although direct interactions with Dsg3 were not observed in co-transfection or yeast two-hybrid assays, Dsg3 was present in an endogenous complex with ectopic PKP2, whereas Dsg2 was not (Fig. 5 D). Together these data suggest that Pg or other unknown proteins may mediate an indirect association between PKP2a and Dsg3 but not Dsg2. The absence of an identifiable complex between ectopic PKP2a and endogenous Dsg2 by co-immunoprecipitation may also indicate that in SCC9 cells, which express both Dsg3 and Dsg2, Dsg3 may compete more effectively for PKP2 due to its relative abundance compared with Dsg2 in the detergent-soluble pool or other factors favoring this interaction.The presence of PKP2 in desmosomes is widespread as it is found in all simple epithelia and in complex epithelia where it is localized throughout the layers and concentrated in desmosomes of the basal layer. These localization data are consistent with our observations, and together they suggest that PKP2a can associate with all Dsg isoforms, either directly or indirectly. Thus PKP2 may be involved in desmosome function on a much broader scale than PKP1, and it is intriguing to consider that it may serve different functions when it is associated with different desmosomal cadherins.In COS cells, ectopic PKP1a efficiently enhances the recruitment of DPNTP to cell borders, and this ability is conferred by the PKP1a head domain (19Kowalczyk A.P. Hatzfeld M. Bornslaeger E.A. Kopp D.S. Borgwardt J.E. Corcoran C.M. Settler A. Green K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18145-18148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because DPNTP contains only the first 584 amino acids of DP and does not bind to IF, we compared the ability of PKP1a and PKP2a to enhance the cell border recruitment of full-length DP that is sequestered along the IF network. Co-expression of PKP1a with DP in COS cells resulted in a pattern of DP distribution vastly different from that when DP was expressed alone. Instead of exhibiting extensive co-alignment with the IF network and occasional border localization, DP was mostly concentrated along the borders, colocalizing with PKP1a. In contrast, the majority of DP remained sequestered along IF in cells co-expressing PKP2a and DP. The fact that both PKPs enhanced the border localization of endogenous DP to a similar level (Fig. 7 A,a and b) could be due to a limiting amount of endogenous DP available for recruitment and that to reveal the higher capacity of PKP1a to recruit DP requires that excess DP be expressed.The different abilities of PKP1 and PKP2 to enhance cell border recruitment of ectopic DP in COS cells might be explained by several mechanisms. Biochemical evidence suggested that DP interacts with PKP2a less robustly than with PKP1a, and an interaction with a certain strength could be required to directly recruit DP to cell borders by PKPs. Secondly, the two PKPs might enhance DP recruitment indirectly through their differential ability to recruit other desmosomal components or as yet unidentified proteins. Furthermore, PKP2a could differ from PKP1a in its propensity to incorporate into desmosomes, and PKP1a may preferentially assemble into desmosomes in COS cells. Because PKP2 has been found mostly concentrated in desmosomes in the basal layer of various stratified epithelial tissues (2Mertens C. Kuhn C. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1009-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), perhaps the participation of PKP2 in desmosomes of the basal layer contributes to the formation of smaller (52White F.H. Gohari K. J. Cell Sci. 1984; 66: 411-429PubMed Google Scholar) and possibly more dynamic desmosomes that are suitable for the amplification and generation of new cells from the basal layer. This may partly be achieved through the reduced capacity of PKP2 to recruit and stabilize other desmosomal components such as DP.Another striking difference between PKP1a and PKP2a is their ability to accumulate in the nucleus in cells overexpressing these proteins. PKP1a and its head domain efficiently concentrated in the nuclei when expressed in a variety of cell lines (17Bornslaeger E.A. Godsel L.M. Corcoran C.M. Park J.K. Hatzfeld M. Kowalczyk A.P. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 727-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hatzfeld M. Haffner C. Schulze K. Vinzens U. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 18145-18148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here we show that PKP2a is mostly excluded from the nucleus in transiently overexpressing cells. The PKP2a head domain can localize to the nucleus more efficiently than full-length PKP2a, indicating that the arm-repeat domain of PKP2a either contains nuclear export signals or has the ability to retain PKP2a in the cytoplasm through interactions with other proteins.Besides interacting with other desmosome plaque proteins, PKP2a is also capable of associating with β-catenin mainly through the PKP2a head domain. Co-expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and PKP2a led to the formation of mutually exclusive complexes that contained β-catenin with either E-cadherin or PKP2a, suggesting that PKP2a is unlikely to interact with β-catenin in the adherens junction. However, ectopic PKP2a formed complexes with endogenous E-cadherin and β-catenin but not with α-catenin in SCC9 cells. This result suggests that other proteins such as Pg could mediate the association between E-cadherin and PKP2a. Because this complex lacks α-catenin, it is unlikely to be found in mature adherens junctions, but it perhaps represents a junction intermediate involved in sorting and segregation of components during the early stages of junction formation or during the dynamic regulation of junctional structures. Even though we were unable to detect colocalization of endogenous PKP2a and β-catenin in SCC9 cells, we did observe extensive colocalization of ectopic PKP2a and its head domain with endogenous β-catenin along the cell borders. It has been shown previously that there is a pool of β-catenin localized in the lateral membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells that does not contain E-cadherin (53Nathke I.S. Hinck L. Swedlow J.R. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), so possibly ectopic PKP2a could interact with this pool of β-catenin at the membrane but not the E-cadherin bound pool of β-catenin.Despite a lack of apparent effect on the total level of β-catenin, PKP2a overexpression resulted in a modest, but reproducible increase in the level of endogenous β-catenin/TCF signaling in SW480 cells. Because we could only achieve about 15% transfection efficiency in SW480 cells, some moderate effect on β-catenin protein level by expression of PKP2a may not have been detectable in the total cell population. PKP2a expression did not seem to change the subcellular localization of β-catenin in transfected cells, and experiments using COS cells and HEK293 cells, which could be transfected at efficiencies greater than 50%, did not reveal any significant effect by PKP2a expression on either the total level of β-catenin or its partitioning into different detergent soluble pools (data not shown). These results suggest that PKP2a modulates β-catenin signaling through mechanisms other than regulating its stability, as have been suggested for several regulators of β-catenin/TCF signaling (54Young C.S. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Nelson R.W. Gumbiner B.M. J.

Expression of ectopic E-cadherin inhibited endogenous β-catenin/TCF signaling and suppressed PKP2a-dependent increases in β-catenin/TCF signaling in SW480 cells. A recent paper presented evidence for the existence of a small pool of transcriptionally active β-catenin among the much larger pool of cytosolic but transcriptionally inactive β-catenin in SW480 cells (47Gottardi C.J.

Although progress in evaluating the functions of other MAPKs has been facilitated by the characterization of specific inhibitors, no JNK-directed inhibitor is commercially available. We have identified a 21-amino acid peptide inhibitor of activated JNKs, based on amino acids 143–163 of the JNK-binding domain (JBD) of the JNK scaffolding protein, JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1). This peptide, I-JIP (Inhibitor of JNK-based on JIP-1), inhibited JNK activity in vitro toward recombinant c-Jun, Elk, and ATF2 up to 90%. A truncated I-JIP (TI-JIP), the C-terminal 11 amino acids of I-JIP, directly interacted with recombinant JNKs but not its substrates as shown by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Scanning alanine replacement within truncated I-JIP identified 4 residues (Arg-156, Pro-157, Leu-160, or Leu-162) as independently critical for inhibition. JBD peptide sequences from JIP-2 and JIP-3 shared these critical residues and accordingly were effective JNK inhibitors. In contrast, peptides based on the JBDs of ATF2 and c-Jun inhibited JNK activity by <40%, which agreed with their lack of homology to the critical Arg-156 and Pro-157. These studies thus define a small peptide inhibitor sequence of JNKs based on the JIP proteins."

Moreover, during development, α-synuclein expression is up-regulated (19.Hsu L. Mallory M. Xia Y. Veinbergs I. Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Thal L. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J.

In contrast, neuronal cell lines expressing α-synuclein that contains mutations (A30P and A53T) associated with familial Parkinsonism and increased misfolding of α-synuclein (9.Conway K. Harper J.

Thus, under some circumstances, increased expression of α-synuclein might protect against oxidative stress and promote regeneration, whereas under pathological conditions, misfolding of α-synuclein might lead to cell death. In this context the main objective of this study was to determine the signaling events involved in protecting cells expressing wild type α-synuclein against oxidative stress. Neuronal response to oxidative stress involves regulation of multiple kinases including several members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family (27.Harper S.J. LoGrasso P. Cell Signalling. 2001; 13: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).

The extracellular signal-regulated kinases are activated by receptor tyrosine kinases and relay proliferation and differentiation signals, whereas p38 and JNK are activated predominantly by stress signaling and are involved in cell survival and cell death (28.Davis R.

Finally although activation of JNK stress-signaling pathways has been shown to play a role in cell death in PD (30.Saporito M.S. Thomas B.A. Scott R.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), inactivation of JNK protects against cell death (31.Xia X.G. Harding T. Weller M. Bieneman A. Uney J.B. Schulz J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10433-10438Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For the present study we found that α-synuclein might protect neuronal cells against oxidative stress damage by down-regulating the JNK pathway. As previously described (24.Hsu L.J. Sagara Y. Arroyo A. Rockenstein E. Sisk A. Mallory M. Wong J. Takenouchi T. Hashimoto M. Masliah E. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), experiments were performed with the glucose transporter (GT) 1–7 murine hypothalamic tumor cell line (kindly provided by Dr. Pam Mellon, University of California San Diego, Department of Neurosciences) maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin. This neuronal cell line was selected because of its ability to express many neuronal markers and form synapses and because it has neurosecretory properties (32.Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P.C. Padula C.A. Roberts J.L. Weiner R.I. Neuron. 1990; 5: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar). Furthermore, α-synuclein overexpression in this cell line resulted in oxidative stress, mitochondrial alterations, and formation of intraneuronal inclusions (24.Hsu L.J. Sagara Y. Arroyo A.

Pathol. 2000; 157: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In addition, experiments were also performed with stable transfected GT1–7 cells overexpressing β-synuclein or JIP-1b/IB1. For this purpose, cDNA templates for murine β-synuclein were generated from total RNA extracted from the mouse brain by reverse transcriptase-PCR and inserted into pCR3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). The murine β-synuclein sequence differs from the human sequence by 3 amino acid substitutions and one deletion (from human to mouse: R45S, E46S and a deletion, A86K, and P122S) (33.Jakes R. Spillantini M. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). To create a stable cell line expressing β-synuclein, GT1–7 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). For stable cell clones, selection was carried out for several weeks in growth medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) until ∼20 resistant colonies were obtained. Clones were screened by immunoblotting and ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) to determine β-synuclein expression (34.Takenouchi T. Hashimoto M. Hsu L. Mackowski B. Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35.Rockenstein E. Hansen L.A. Mallory M. Trojanowski J.Q. Galasko D. Masliah E. Brain Res. 2001; 914: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). For JNK-interacting protein (JIP)-1b/islet-brain (IB)1 (JIP-1b/IB1), GT1–7 cells were transfected with pKB expression vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with or without the insertion of rat IB-1 (homologue to human JIP-1b) cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Christophe Bonny, CHUV University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland) (36.Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection and selection were performed as described above, and JIP-1b/IB1 expression was screened by RPA and immunoblot analysis. Total cell homogenates or cells homogenates fractionated into cytosolic and particulate fractions were prepared as previously described (34.Takenouchi T. Hashimoto M. Hsu L. Mackowski B. Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and used for immunoblot analysis. For the JNK immunoblot analysis, cells were dissolved in extraction buffer (described in the immunocomplex kinase assay), and the Triton-soluble fractions were used. Protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce). Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as previously described (34.Takenouchi T. Hashimoto M. Hsu L. Mackowski B. Rockenstein E. Mallory M. Masliah E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schunell). Transfers were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl) followed by incubation in primary antibodies diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS. Membranes were then incubated with either125I-proteinA (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and analyzed with the PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) or subjected to detection using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The primary antibodies used were as follows: JNK (C-17; rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), JIP-1b/IB1(E-19; goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), C-terminal α-synuclein (amino acids 101–124; rabbit polyclonal) (16.Iwai A. Masliah E. De Yoshimoto M. Silva R. Ge N. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1994; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1134) Google Scholar), phospho-JNK (pJNK) (G-7; mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz), and α-actin (mouse monoclonal, Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The blots were then stripped and reprobed with monoclonal anti-actin antibody (clone number AC-40, Sigma, 1:1000), followed by incubation with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:10,000; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and ECL. To analyze the effects of α-synuclein in the activity of JNK pathway, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested with extraction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin A) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were separated, and the protein contents were estimated with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Cell lysates (200 μg) were incubated with specific antibodies for 3 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The kinase complexes were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in JNK assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmglycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmdithiothreitol) containing glutathione S-transferase-c-JUN1–79 (Calbiochem) as a substrate (5 μg/sample) and 1.0 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and exposed to film or phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). Total RNA was isolated from snap-frozen cell cultures using the TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH). 32P-Labeled antisense riboprobes were used to identify specific mRNAs. Briefly, as previously described, riboprobe templates were amplified by PCR (19.Hsu L. Mallory M. Xia Y. Veinbergs I. Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Thal L. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For the murine α-synuclein template, primers started at nucleotides 145 and 490 of mouse α-synuclein (GenBankTM accession number AF044672). For murine β-synuclein template, primers started at nucleotides 256 and 484 (GenBankTM accession number NM-033610); for JIP-1b, primers started at nucleotides 1532 and 1901 (GenBankTM accession number AF109768). An actin riboprobe that is complementary to nucleotides 480–565 of mouse β-actin was used (GenBankTM accession number X03672). RPAs were carried out with [32P]-labeled antisense riboprobes, and signals were quantitated with a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant software, as previously described (35.Rockenstein E. Hansen L.A. Mallory M. Trojanowski J.Q. Galasko D. Masliah E. Brain Res. 2001; 914: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Actin signals were used to correct for variations in mRNA content and loading. To analyze the effects of a-synuclein on JIP-1b/IB1 DNA binding activity, nuclear extracts for EMSA were prepared by a mini-extraction protocol (37.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). An assay was performed by a previously described method (36.Bonny C. Thompson N. Nicod P. Waeber G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1413-1426PubMed Google Scholar) with the some modifications. Briefly, nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 20 μl of 2 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 32P-oligonucleotides (30,000 counts/min). For competition studies, before the addition of the labeled probe, nuclear extracts were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled (cold) oligonucleotides. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× TGE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) followed by vacuum-drying and autoradiography. The sequences of the sense strands of the oligonucleotides used in the EMSAs were as follows: GTII, 5′-GTAAAGGGTGTATTGATTGGATTACCATCAATACTCAGCTTCT-3′ mutant GTII, 5′-GTAAAGGGTGTACCACGTGGATTACCAGTGGCACTCAGCTTCT-3′. To study the fate of the transfected cells treated with hydrogen peroxide, cell viability was measured by the trypan blue exclusion assay. After the addition of 0.4% trypan blue for 2 min (Sigma), the percent of dead cells (trypan blue-stained) was recorded within 10 min and visualized with an Axiovert inverted microscope. In addition, a DNA fragmentation assay was performed as previously described (38.Van Uden E. Sagara Y. Van Uden J. Orlando R. Mallory M. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20525-30530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (1 × 106) were washed and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in TE buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA) containing 0.5% v/v Triton X-100 for 20 min at 4 °C, and the high molecular weight DNA was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min in the presence of 0.1% SDS. The supernatants were then extracted with a mixture of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform. After precipitation with ethanol, samples were resuspended in TE buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A for 3 h at 30 °C and analyzed on 1.8% agarose gels. Cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, grown to 60% confluence, and fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were first incubated overnight at 4 °C with the antibody against murine α-synuclein (rabbit polyclonal, 1:10,000) or the goat polyclonal anti-JIP-1b/IB1 (E-19, Santa Cruz) and detected with the Tyramide Signal Amplification™-Direct (Red) system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (19.Hsu L. Mallory M. Xia Y. Veinbergs I. Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Thal L. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Then, cells were incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2, dendritic and neuronal marker, 1:50) (Chemicon) or growth- associated protein 43 (growth cone marker, 1:1000) (Sigma) followed by detection with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA. Coverslips were air-dried overnight, mounted on slides with anti-fading media (Vector), and imaged with the laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) (Bio-Rad, MRC1024) (19.Hsu L. Mallory M. Xia Y. Veinbergs I. Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Thal L. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To determine whether stress associated with α-synuclein accumulation activates the JNK pathway, levels of pJNK immunoreativity by immunoblot (Fig. 1A) and immunocomplex kinase assay (Fig. 1B) was determined in α- or β-synuclein-overexpressing and vector-transfected cells (Fig. 2A). These cell lines have been previously characterized (19.Hsu L. Mallory M. Xia Y. Veinbergs I. Hashimoto M. Yoshimoto M. Thal L. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and levels of synuclein expression were confirmed by RPA (Fig. 2, A and B). Under basal conditions no differences in pJNK immunoreactivity (Fig. 1A) or activity (Fig. 1B) were observed among α-synuclein, β-synuclein, or vector-alone-transfected cells. However, after hydrogen peroxide (∼200 μm) treatment for 30 min, β-synuclein-overexpressing and vector-transfected cells showed a significant increase in pJNK immunoreactivity (Fig. 1A) and JNK activity (Fig. 1B), whereas in the α-synuclein-transfected cells peroxide challenge did not activate the JNK pathway. Because peroxide treatment activated the JNK pathway in the β-synuclein-overexpressing and vector-transfected cells but not in the α-synuclein-transfected cells and because JNK activation has been generally associated with cell death, both trypan blue exclusion and DNA fragmentation assays were performed to assess cell viability (Fig. 1, C and D). These studies showed that although α-synuclein-overexpressing cells were resistant to hydrogen peroxide treatment, both β-synuclein-overexpressing and vector-transfected cells were vulnerable to hydrogen peroxide treatment (Fig. 1, C and D). Taken together, these results indicate that JNK inactivation might confer resistance to peroxide and cell death in α-synuclein-overexpressing cells.Figure 2Analysis of synuclein and JIP-1b/IB1 mRNA expression levels by RPA. A, representative autoradiogram showing that α-synuclein was identified as a 345-base pair (bp) band, β-synuclein was identified as a 229-base pair band, and actin was identified as a 85-base pair band. RPA was performed in synuclein (half of the image to the left)- and JIP-1b/IB1 (half of the image to the right)-transfected GT1–7-transfected cell lines. Controls exist on cells transfected with vector alone. The first lane to the left corresponds to undigested probes (U), and last lane to the right corresponds to mouse brain (M). B, levels of α-synuclein expression were estimated in dried gels that were exposed to Biomax® film (Eastman Kodak Co.), and signals were quantitated with a PhosphorImager SF (Molecular Dynamics) using the ImageQuant software and expressed as integrated pixel intensities over defined volumes. Final values were expressed as ratios of (specific signal background)/(actin signal background) to correct for differences in RNA content/loading across samples. C, representative autoradiogram showing that JIP/1B was identified as a 339-base pair band. RPA was performed in synuclein (half of the image to the left)- and JIP-1b/IB1 (half of the image to the right)transfected GT1–7-transfected cell lines. D, levels of JIP1b/IB1 in synuclein and JIP1b/IB1transfected cells. α-Synuclein-overexpressing cells displayed increased expression of JIP1b/IB1 compared with vectortransfected cells, whereas the β-synuclein-overexpressing cells exhibited decreased JIP-1b expression. E, reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis to differentiate JIP-1a and JIP-1b mRNA expression. Rat JIP-1b/IB1 cDNA was used as a positive control.

https://openalex.org/W2050708164,"We have investigated the effects of the myotoxic local anesthetic bupivacaine on rat skeletal muscle mitochondria and isolated myofibers from flexor digitorum brevis, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, and from the proximal, striated portion of the esophagus. In isolated mitochondria, bupivacaine caused a concentration-dependent mitochondrial depolarization and pyridine nucleotide oxidation, which were matched by an increased oxygen consumption at bupivacaine concentrations of 1.5 mm or less at pH 7.4, whereas respiration was inhibited at higher concentrations. As a consequence of depolarization, bupivacaine caused the opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP), a cyclosporin A-sensitive inner membrane channel that plays a key role in many forms of cell death. In intact flexor digitorum brevis fibers bupivacaine caused mitochondrial depolarization and pyridine nucleotides oxidation that were matched by increased concentrations of cytosolic free Ca(2+), release of cytochrome c, and eventually, hypercontracture. Both mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release were inhibited by cyclosporin A, indicating that PTP opening rather than bupivacaine as such was responsible for these events. Similar responses to bupivacaine were observed in the soleus, which is highly oxidative. In contrast, fibers from the esophagus (which we show to be more fatigable than flexor digitorum brevis fibers) and from the highly glycolytic extensor digitorum longus didn't undergo pyridine nucleotide oxidation upon the addition of bupivacaine and were resistant to bupivacaine toxicity. These results suggest that active oxidative metabolism is a key determinant in bupivacaine toxicity, that bupivacaine myotoxicity is a relevant model of mitochondrial dysfunction involving the PTP and Ca(2+) dysregulation, and that it represents a promising system to test new PTP inhibitors that may prove relevant in spontaneous myopathies where mitochondria have long been suspected to play a role."

These observations indicate that HS modifications do not occur randomly but that a controlled expression of specific domains/sequences in HS exists.

Antibody production was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Plates were centrifuged, and the supernatant containing soluble antibodies was applied to wells of polystyrene microtiter plates previously coated with HS. Bound antibodies were detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) directed against the c-Myc tag followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Bacteria expressing anti-HS antibodies were analyzed for the presence of full-length inserts by 25 cycles of PCR using plasmid DNA as template (15.van Kuppevelt T.H.

Fingerprinting was performed using BstNI (CC(A/T)GG) as the restriction enzyme. PCR and fingerprinting analysis were performed using 1% (w/v) and 4% (w/v) agarose gels, respectively. To establish the complementarity determining region 3 and the germ line VHgene DNA segments, unique clones were sequenced using FOR LINK SEQ RIC (5′-GCCACCTCCGCCTGAACC) as the primer (located in the linker region between the VH and the VL gene). For this purpose, double-stranded DNA was isolated using standard procedures. To obtain optimal amounts of soluble anti-HS antibodies, phages were allowed to infect the non-suppressor E. coli strain HB2151. The periplasmic fraction of bacteria was used as the source of antibodies (15.van Kuppevelt T.H. Dennissen M.A.B.A. van Venrooij W.J. Hoet R.M.A. Veerkamp J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12960-12966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were grown at 37 °C until an optical density of 0.5–0.8 was reached. Induction was obtained by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After incubation at 30 °C for 3 h, the culture was harvested, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 mm sodium borate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 160 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. After centrifugation, the supernatant was filtered and dialyzed versus PBS. The preparation thus obtained is the periplasmic fraction. Reactivity of the anti-HS antibodies with various molecules was evaluated in ELISA in two ways: (a) by the application of antibodies to wells of polystyrene plates coated with the test molecules and (b) by an inhibition assay in which the antibodies were incubated with the test molecule for 16 h at 22 °C followed by transfer to wells previously coated with HS (bovine kidney, (15.van Kuppevelt T.H.

Test molecules included HS from bovine kidney, aorta, lung, intestine, human aorta, pig intestine, and whale lung; heparin, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfate, keratan sulfate, dextran sulfate, hyaluronate, and K5 polysaccharide from E. coli; bovine serum albumin; marvel (the non-fat milk preparation using as a blocking reagent during panning); and DNA. To analyze which chemical groups in HS are involved in antibody binding, a large number of modified HS preparations and synthetic HS-oligosaccharides were evaluated. They included HS from bovine kidney, which was digested with heparinase I, II, or III or with HNO2 at pH 1.5, and chemically modified HS (bovine kidney) and heparins (porcine intestine). The latter included preparations that were completely desulfated and N-acetylated, preparations that were completely O-desulfated and N-sulfated, and preparations that were N-desulfated and N-acetylated. The antibodies were also analyzed using a panel of 12 defined synthetic HS oligosaccharides. Bound antibodies were detected using anti c-Myc tag mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody. Enzyme activity was detected using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate, and absorbance was read at 405 nm. Various rat tissue specimens (Wistar, male, 3 months old) were snap-frozen in liquid isopentane cooled with liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Cryosections (5 μm) were rehydrated for 10 min in PBS, blocked with PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and incubated with anti-HS antibodies for 90 min at 22 °C. As a control, antibodies from non-related clones were used. These antibodies did not stain rat tissue sections. Antibodies were detected by incubation with mouse anti-c-Myc tag antibodies (9E10, culture supernatant) followed by Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin), both for 90 min at 22 °C. After each incubation, sections were washed in PBS (three times for 10 min). Additional controls were the omission of primary or conjugated antibody. To evaluate the specificity of the antibodies, cryosections were pretreated with heparinase III (digests HS) and with chondroitinase ABC (digests dermatan and chondroitin sulfates). As control, sections were incubated in the reaction buffer without enzyme. After rinsing and blocking, the sections were incubated with antibodies and processed for immunofluorescence as described. The efficacy of heparinase III treatment was analyzed using antibodies (3G10) against HS stubs generated by heparinase III. The efficacy of chondroitinase ABC treatment was evaluated by incubation of sections with antibodies (2B6) against chondroitin sulfate stubs generated by chondroitinase ABC. Specificity of the anti-HS antibodies was further tested by overnight preincubation of the antibodies with various molecules, viz.HS (bovine kidney), heparin, dermatan sulfate, chondroitin 4- and 6-sulfate, keratan sulfate, dextran sulfate, hyaluronate, and DNA as described (15.van Kuppevelt T.H.

Five antibodies were obtained against bovine kidney HS (antibodies HS3A8, HS3B7, HS4A5, HS4D4, and HS4E4), and three antibodies were obtained against human lung HS (antibodies EV3B2, EV3D1, and EV3C3). The antibodies against mouse and human skeletal muscle HS (antibodies AO4B08 and RB4EA12, respectively) have been described previously (16.Jenniskens G.J. Oosterhof A. Brandwijk R.

Using ELISA, antibodies were shown to be specific for HS and heparin and not to be reactive with other glycosaminoglycans such as dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates, hyaluronate, and keratan sulfate nor with other polyanionic molecules such as dextran sulfate and DNA. Antibodies show a characteristic reactivity with HS preparations isolated from various sources such as bovine kidney, aorta, lung, and intestine, human aorta, and whale lung (Table II). None of the antibodies is reactive with the bacterial capsular polysaccharide K5, which is similar to the HS precursor polysaccharide. Therefore, all 10 antibodies recognize specific structural modifications.Table IIReactivity of anti-HS antibodies with various HS preparations (ELISA)PreparationAntibodyHS3A8HS3B7HS4A5HS4D4HS4E4EV3B2EV3C3EV3D1AO4B08RB4EA12HS, bovine kidney100100100100100100100100100100K5, capsular polysaccharideaSimilar to the HS precursor polysaccharide.

Open table in a new tab Values (in % of reactivity with HS from bovine kidney) represent mean ± SD (n = 3). The ratio of sulfate groups to disaccharide is indicated in parentheses. Antibodies were tested for reactivity with modified HS/heparin preparations (Table III) and with various synthetic HS oligosaccharides (Table IV) to identify which modifications in HS are involved in binding. Results show that all antibodies recognize different structures in HS. In all cases, sulfate groups are essential. HS and heparin stripped from their O- and N-sulfate groups are not reactive with the antibodies. Treatment of HS with HNO2 at pH 1.5 (cleavage at N-sulfated glucosamine residues (GlcNS) and the rare N-unsubstituted glucosamine residues) abolishes antibody binding. Treatment of HS with heparinase I (cleaves at sulfated domain structures) results in the loss of binding activity of eight out of 10 antibodies. For a number of antibodies, structural modifications of HS important for binding could be identified (Tables III and IV). HS3A8 recognizes highly sulfated domains within HS since it reacts only with highly sulfated oligosaccharides. The antibody strongly prefers 6-O-, N-sulfated glucosamine (GlcNS6S) and prefers sulfated iduronic acid (IdoUA2S) over non-sulfated iduronic acid (IdoUA). The preferred sequence (starting at the non-reducing end) is GlcNS6S-IdoUA2S-GlcN6S6. Antibodies HS3B7 and RB4EA12 recognize IdoUA-GlcNS6S containing domains, 2-Osulfation of IdoUA impeding binding (compare compounds 10 and 12 and compounds 11 and 12, Table IV). Differences in topological distribution (see below), however, indicate that each antibody recognizes a different epitope. Antibody HS4A5 recognizes various sequences, and the preferred sequence can best be described as GlcNS ± 6S − IdoU ± 2S − GlcNS ± 6S. N-sulfation alone is not sufficient for binding (Table III). This generic sequence may indicate the recognition of a wide variety of structures, but the restricted topological distribution (blood vessel-associated basement membranes only, see below) argues against this (Fig. 1). Antibodies HS4D4 and AO4B08 are reactive with domains containing GlcNS6S-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S sequences. Non-sulfated IdoUA impedes binding (compare compounds 10 and 12, Table IV). For AO4B08, an additional 3-O-sulfate group on GlcNS6S has no influence (compare compounds 9 and 10, Table IV). HS4D4, however, requires an additional modification, possibly 3-O sulfation of GlcNS6S (compare the reactivity of HS4D4 and AO4B08 for compounds 5, Table IV). N-sulfation seems of minor importance (Table III). HS epitopes recognized by the two antibodies have a different topological distribution (see below). Antibody HS4E4 is not reactive with any of the synthetic HS oligosaccharides tested. It is the only antibody that reacts with completely desulfated/N-sulfated heparin/HS (Table III), suggesting that N-sulfation is of major importance. It reacts strongly with human aorta HS (Table II), which is largely devoid of 6-O-sulfation (18.Safaiyan F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10823-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and which may indicate that this modification is inhibitory. Taken together, these data suggest that HS4E4 recognizes GlcNS-IdoUA2S-containing domains. EV3B2 recognizes domains containing GlcNS ± 6S − UA − GlcNS ± 6S, where UA represents GlcUA or IdoUA. 2-O-sulfation of IdoUA improves binding (compare compounds 10 and 12, Table IV); 3-O-sulfation of GlcNS seems to be of no importance (compare compounds 9 and 10, Table IV). EV3D1 needs GlcUA in a certain chemical context, preferably flanked by a GlcNS (±6S) but not by a non-sulfated IdoUA (compare compounds 6 and 7 and compounds 10 and 12, Table IV). The final antibody, EV3C3, recognizes HS structures that could not be clearly identified. All antibodies, except EV3C3, EV3D1, and EV3B2, bind to perlecan, an HS-proteoglycan isolated from the extracellular matrix of the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma (19.Hassell J.R. Robey P.

In the kidney, the anti-HS antibodies primarily stain basement membranes (Fig. 1, Table V). Antibodies HS4A5, RB4EA12, and HS4E4/AO4B08 (both have a similar topology) recognize structures with a clearly differently topological distribution as compared with structures recognized by the other antibodies. These antibodies show a more or less similar tissue distribution, although with some difference in staining intensity. Some antibodies (HS3A8 and HS4D4) show a similar topological staining in renal tissue but a differential distribution in testicular tissue (Fig. 1).Table VDistribution of HS-epitopes defined by antibodies in rat kidney.Basement membraneAntibodyHS3A8HS3B7HS4A5HS4D4HS4E4EV3B2EV3C3EV3D1AO4B08RB4eA12Glomerulus+++++++–++++++––Bowman's capsule+++–++++++++++++–Peritubular capillaries++++++++++++++++–Cortical tubules++++–++++++++++++++aOnly a subset of tubules is stained.Smooth muscle cells++–++++++++–Large blood vessel endothelium++++++++/−+/−+–Cryosections were processed for immunofluorescence as described (17.Tomlinson I.M.

Staining of all the antibodies was abolished by pretreatment of sections with heparinase III but not with chondroitinase ABC. Preincubation of antibodies with HS and heparin precluded staining. Incubation with other glycosaminoglycans, with dextran sulfate, or with DNA has no effect. Next to proteins and nucleic acids, polysaccharides may form a third group of information-dense biopolymers. This especially holds for HS, a class of linear polysaccharides involved in many basic cellular phenomena. Theoretically, cells can generate a large potential of different monosaccharide sequences (domains) in HS (see below). To study whether such a potential indeed exists in vivo, we selected 10 anti-HS antibodies by phage display technology. This technology has proven to be very useful for obtaining antibodies against HS, which are almost non-immunogenic (15.van Kuppevelt T.H. Dennissen M.A.B.A. van Venrooij W.J.

All 10 antibodies recognize a unique epitope structure, the position of sulfate groups being of major importance. Together with the five anti-HS antibodies already described (15.van Kuppevelt T.H.

All epitope structures have a defined topological tissue distribution, indicating that in vivo, a tightly controlled biosynthetic apparatus for HS exists. This may also be true for chondroitin sulfates since a number of anti-chondroitin sulfate antibodies have been generated that show a specific distribution in tissues (22.Couchman J.R. Caterson B. Christner J.E. Baker J.R. Nature. 1984; 307: 650-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 23.Sorrell J.M. Mahmoodian F. Schafer I.A. Davis B. Caterson B. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1990; 38: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of HS allows for a large number of different sequences. The HS precursor polysaccharide chain is made up of repeating disaccharide units that consist of a glucuronic acid and a GlcNAc residue. These disaccharide units, of which there can be up to a 150 in HS, can undergo a number of modifications. Some GlcNAc residues are N-deacetylated and subsequently N-sulfated, and this step serves as a trigger for further modifications such as epimerization of GlcUA to IdoUA, 2-O-sulfation of GlcUA and IdoUA, and 6-O- and/or 3-O-sulfation of GlcN. Modification occurs in specific regions of the polysaccharide chain leading to highly modified domains (N- and O-sulfate rich) interspaced by less modified domains (1.Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar, 4.Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The number of disaccharide units and their possible modifications can (theoretically) give rise to a tremendous structural variation. An octasaccharide, for instance, already has over a million possible monosaccharide sequences. The importance of specific modifications in vivo have been demonstrated. Genetic studies in Drosophila, mice, and humans reveal the involvement of HS in cell differentiation and morphogenesis. In Drosophila, mutations in genes encoding enzymes involved in HS biosynthesis (sugarless, sulfateless, and tout-velu) lead to a loss of specific signaling pathways (FGF, Wingless, and Hedgehog), resulting in severe alterations in phenotype. In mice, a mutation in the gene encoding 2-O-sulfotransferase leads to multiple developmental abnormalities, whereas targeted gene disruption in the genes encoding glucosaminyl N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 and -2 result in lethal respiratory distress and mast cell abnormalities, respectively (24.Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). In humans, mutations in glycosyltransferases involved in HS biosynthesis (EXT1 and EXT2) lead to hereditary multiple exostoses (25.McCormick C. Leduc Y. Martindale D. Mattison K. Esford L.E. Dyer A.P. Tufaro F. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that specific HS modifications play a crucial role in developmental processes. Our data indicate that indeed a large number of HS epitopes exist in vivo and that these do not occur randomly but are tightly, topologically, regulated. This indicates the existence of a tightly controlled pattern of modifications occurring during the biosynthesis of HS. Aberrations in HS fine structure have been implied in various pathological conditions including nephropathies, cancer, and bacterial and viral infections (21.Raats C.J.I. van den Born J.

https://openalex.org/W2080704341,"In some cell types either DNA damage or p53 expression leads to minimal cell death, while combining the two leads to a strong apoptotic response. To further understand features of p53 that contribute to this increased cell death we used clones of H1299 cells that express wild-type or several mutant forms of p53 under a tetracycline-regulated promoter. In these cells the induction of wild-type p53 leads to significant apoptosis only when combined with exposure to a number of chemotherapeutic agents. A common target of p53, p21, is itself not sufficient to cause apoptosis in the presence of these chemotherapeutic compounds. Many agents also effectively increase cell death when a transcriptionally-defective p53, p53[gln22ser23], is induced, although a dramatic exception is treatment with 5-FU, which strongly cooperates with wild-type but not p53[gln22ser23]. Our results with 5-FU thus show that genetically separable functions of p53 are involved in its ability to respond to DNA-damaging agents to induce apoptosis. Notably as well, deleting the C-terminal 30 amino acids of p53 does not affect this cooperative effect with DNA-damaging agents. By contrast, a p53 mutant lacking the PXXP-domain between residues 60–90, while at least partially transcriptionally-competent, cannot be rendered apoptotic by any compounds that we tested. Thus the PXXP domain provides an essential component of the ability of p53 to respond to DNA-damaging agents to cause cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2168726708,"In Jurkat cells Bid was cleaved upon activation of the Fas receptor with an anti-Fas antibody. The caspase-8 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-CH2F (IETD) prevented the cleavage of Bid and the loss of viability. The nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) was also cleaved upon the activation of caspases, and IETD similarly prevented PARP cleavage. The PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB) restored the cell killing in the presence of IETD, an effect that occurred without restoration of the cleavage of Bid or PARP. In the presence of 3-AB and IETD, translocation occurred of full-length Bid to the mitochondria. The induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) was documented by the cyclosporin A (CyA) sensitivity of the release of cytochrome c, the release of malate dehydrogenase from the mitochondrial matrix, the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, and the pronounced swelling of these organelles, as assessed by electron microscopy. In addition to preventing all evidence of the MPT, CyA prevented the loss of cell viability, without effect on the cleavage of either Bid or PARP. The prevention of PARP cleavage by inhibition of caspase-3 resulted in a 10-fold activation of the enzyme and a resultant depletion of NAD and ATP. The PARP inhibitor 3-AB prevented the loss of NAD and ATP. Depletion of ATP by metabolic inhibitors similarly prevented the cell killing. It is concluded that the cleaving of PARP in Fas-mediated apoptosis allowed expression of an energy-dependent cell death program that included the translocation of full-length Bid to the mitochondria with induction of the MPT.

A substantial recent effort has addressed both the interdependence of these proteins and the nature of their action on the mitochondria, whether individually or as components of a proapoptotic cascade. Bax and Bak are members of the Bcl-2 family and share 3 homology domains that are designated BH1 to BH3 (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4819) Google Scholar, 2Gross A. MCDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar). By contrast, Bid and Bik share sequence homology with the other Bcl-2 proteins only at the BH3 or “death” domain (BH3-only proteins) (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4819) Google Scholar, 2Gross A. MCDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar). This feature suggested that Bid might function to receive death signals in the cytosol from upstream events and then, upon translocation to the mitochondrion, interact with membrane-bound downstream effector pathways (3Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Several different scenarios have been proposed that involve Bid acting alone or in association with other proapopotic proteins, specifically Bax or Bak. In staurosporine-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, it is argued that Bid interacts with Bax to trigger a change in Bax conformation that leads, in turn, to the insertion of Bax into the outer mitochondrial membrane (4Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 5Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). In this model, Bid-induced Bax membrane insertion is independent of caspase activation (4Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). An association of Bid and Bax on the surface of the mitochondrial outer membrane is proposed to bring about changes in the conformation of Bax that are required for membrane insertion and activation. It deserves note, however, that embryonic fibroblasts prepared from mice deficient in Bid are not resistant to the cell killing by staurosporine (6Yin X.-M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Bid has been implicated in the TNF1 and Fas death signal pathways. It is held that cytosolic p22 Bid represents an inactive conformation of the molecule that is cleaved by proteolysis to generate an active p15 or truncated Bid (tBid) (7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 8Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1155-1163Google Scholar). Engagement of either the TNF or Fas receptor recruits first FADD and then the proenzyme form of caspase-8. Activated caspase-8 then cleaves Bid to generate tBid that translocates to the mitochondria. tBid induces release of cytochromec by a mechanism that is independent of the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (4Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.-C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar, 5Eskes R. Desagher S.

A. 2000; 97: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The ability of caspase-8 inhibitors to block Fas and TNF signaling is explained by the disruption of Bid processing. Hepatocytes, fibroblasts, or thymocytes derived from Bid-deficient mice activate caspase-8 but survive longer upon treatment with anti-Fas antibody or TNF (6Yin X.-M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Other inducers of apoptosis, including staurosporine, dexamethasone, and γ-radiation, which presumably do not act by activating either the TNF or Fas receptors, kill Bid-deficient cells to the same extent as wild type ones (6Yin X.-M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). An interaction of Bid with Bak has also been proposed. tBid could not cause cytochrome c release from isolated Bak-deficient mitochondria (12Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2060-2071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Resident in mitochondrial membranes, Bak is envisioned to undergo allosteric activation as a result of a conformational change induced by its interaction with tBid. In the present study, we have utilized Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell line, to re-examine the role of Bid in the cell killing that occurs subsequent to activation of the Fas receptor. Jurkat cells are very sensitive to activation of the Fas receptor. Caspase inhibitors readily prevent the resulting apoptosis. In addition, Jurkat cells do not contain Bax. The data presented below argue that upon activation of the Fas receptor full-length Bid translocates to the mitochondria, where it produces the release of cytochrome c as a result of induction of the MPT. The ability of caspase inhibitors to prevent the killing of Jurkat cells cannot be attributed to an inhibition of Bid processing. Rather, the likely basis of their anti-apoptotic effect is the prevention of PARP cleavage and the resultant activation of the enzyme. Jurkat cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in 25-cm2 polystyrene flasks (Corning Glass) with RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA), containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells (ATCC-CC-1) were maintained in 25-cm2 polystyrene flasks with 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Inc.) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cells were incubated under an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. For all experiments, Jurkat cells were centrifuged, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in RPMI medium without fetal bovine serum. Experiments were performed 18–20 h after plating the cells. In all experiments anti-Fas/APO-1 human monoclonal antibody, clone CH-11 (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) was added to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Ceramide (Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was dissolved in Me2SO and added at a final concentration of 10 μm. Where indicated the cells were pretreated for 30 min with one or more of the following reagents before addition of either anti-Fas antibody or ceramide. The caspase-8 inhibitorZ-Ile-Glu(OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-CH2F (IETD) (Kamiya Biomedical Co., Seattle, WA) was dissolved in Me2SO and added at 50 μm. Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-aspartic acid aldehyde, (DEVD) (Bachem Bioscience, King of Prussia, PA), a caspase-3 inhibitor, and 3-aminobenzamide (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the cells at 200 μm. CyA (Biomol) was dissolved in Me2SO and added at a final concentration of 5 μm. ArA (Biomol) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline and added at a final concentration of 50 μm. In all cases the vehicles used to prepare stock solutions of the reagents had no effect (at 0.1% v/v) on the cells or the parameters measured. Cells (1 × 106) were pelleted at 700 × g (5 min at 4 °C) and lysed in 100 μl of cell lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After 30 min on ice, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). Equivalent amounts of protein (40 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Kaleidoscope Prestained Standards (Bio-Rad) were used to determine molecular weight. The gels were then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Bid was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). Bax was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (N-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Bik was detected with a goat polyclonal antibody (N-19) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bak was detected with a goat polyclonal antibody (N-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Bad was detected with a mouse monoclonal antibody (C-7) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In each case, the relevant protein was visualized by staining with the appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. To analyze Bid, Bax, and Bak RNA by RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from Jurkat and HeLa cells. The following sense and antisense primers were designed and utilized for reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cDNA for Bid, Bax, and Bak from the isolated total RNA: ATGGACTGTTGAGGTCAACAAC (sense) and TCAGTCCATCCCATTTCTGGCT (antisense) for Bid; ATGGACGGGTCCGGGGAGCAG (sense) and TCAGCCCATCT-TCTTCCAGAT (antisense) for Bax; and ATGGCTTCGGGGCAAGGCCCAGGTCCTCCC (sense) and TCATGATTTGAAGAATCTTCGTACCACAAA (antisense) for Bak. The PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel using a 100-bp marker (MBI Fermentas, Hanover, MD) as a standard. Jurkat cells were plated at a density of 105 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Cell viability was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt and phenazine methosulfate according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The absorbance was determined at 490 nm on a Titertek Multiscan Plus plate reader. Cells (25 × 106) were plated in 75-cm2polystyrene flasks. Following treatment the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 250 mm sucrose. The cells were broken open with 6 passages through a 26-gauge needle applied to a 1-ml syringe. The homogenate was centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was transferred to a high speed centrifuge tube. Centrifugation was conducted at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting mitochondrial pellet was lysed in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. The supernatant from the 10,000 × g spin was centrifuged at 100,000 × g (60 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was used for preparation of cytosol. The cytosolic fraction was concentrated through a Microcon YM-10 Centrifugal Filter Device (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Protein content of the fractions was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions (equal amounts from 20 to 40 μg of protein) were analyzed by electrophoresis and electroblotting as described above. Cytochrome c was detected by a monoclonal antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). MDH was detected with a sheep polyclonal horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). To ensure that the same content of mitochondrial and cytosolic protein was loaded in each case, the same nitrocellulose blots used for the determination of cytochromec or MDH were also stained for either both cytochromec oxidase subunit IV (Cox4) or β-actin (antihuman mouse monoclonal antibodies against either Cox4 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) or β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition was determined in intact cells as the CyA-sensitive release of 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) by modification of the method of Krippner et al. (13Krippner A. Matsuno-Yagi A. Gottlieb R.A. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21629-21636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells in 500 μl of serum-free RPMI medium were plated in 24-well plates. After overnight incubation, the cells were treated as described above. During the last 30 min of treatment, the cells were loaded with a final concentration of 100 nmof DiOC6 (3Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Afterward the cells were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed by resuspension in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The washed pellet was lysed by the addition of 600 μl of distilled, deionized water and was then homogenized. The fluorescence of DiOC6(3) in the homogenate was then read in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-5 fluorescence spectrophotometer at 488 nm (excitation) and 500 (emission). Values for deenergized mitochondria were determined by simultaneous treatment of cells with 10 μm CCCP and DiOC6(3). CCCP was dissolved in ethanol and added at a volume of 0.5%. PARP activity was determined in Jurkat cells by a modification of the methods of Zingarelli et al. (14Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Wong H. Salzman A.L. Szabo C. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 139-176Google Scholar) and Wielckens and Delfs (15Wielckens K. Delfs T. Endocrinology. 1986; 119: 2383-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells in 500 μl of serum-free RPMI medium were plated in 24-well plates. After overnight incubation, the cells were treated as described above. Following treatment, the cells were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 8,000 ×g for 10 min. The medium was removed, and 500 μl of a buffer containing 56 mm HEPES, 28 mm KCl, 28 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml digitonin, with 1.0 μCi of [3H]NAD+ (4.5 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. The cells were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 200 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid. After 30 min at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet washed with 500 μl of 3% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was then solubilized with 1 ml of 2% SDS in 0.1 n NaOH. The samples were transferred to scintillation vials, and following neutralization with sufficient glacial acetic acid, the samples were counted in 10 ml of scintillation fluid on a Beckman LS 3801 scintillation counter. The cellular ATP content was determined by modification of the firefly luciferin-luciferase method as described previously (16Kane A.B. Petrovich D.R. Stern R.O. Farber J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: C256-C266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in RPMI medium from 24-well plates were transferred into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and 20 μl of trichloroacetic acid was added to give a final concentration of 3%. After 30 min at 4 °C, the cells were centrifuged at 14,000 × g. An aliquot of the supernatant (250 μl) was removed and neutralized with KOH. The volume was brought to 1 ml with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. One hundred μl of a firefly extract (2 mg/ml in 50 mmK2HAsO4 and 20 mmMgSO4, pH 7.4, and then filtered through 0.45-micron filter) was injected into a tube containing 20 μl of sample. The resulting light emission was measured in an LB 9501/16 Lumat (EG & G Berthold Co.). ATP standards were placed in acidified medium and processed in identical fashion as the samples. The protein content of the pellet was determined by using bicinchoninic acid with bovine serum albumin as the standard (17Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18709) Google Scholar). The cellular NAD+ content was determined by modification of the cycling assay (18Bernofsky C. Swan M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 452-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 19Stubberfield C.R. Cohen G.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 3967-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Yammamoto K. Farber J.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1119-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After treatment cells were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 8,000 × g to pellet the cells. The supernatants were removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 3% trichloroacetic acid. After 30 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g. The supernatant was removed and neutralized with 100 μl of 800 mm KOH containing 200 mm Tris. The reaction mixture contained 900 μl of 66.7 μm of the tetrazolium salt of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, 266 μm phenazine methosulfate, 160 mm ethanol (in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4), 200 μl of sample or NAD+ standard, and 100 μl of 180 units/ml alcohol dehydrogenase. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C in the dark for 1 h. After cooling, the absorbance was read at 570 nm on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 1 UV-visible spectrophotometer. After treatment the cells were trypsinized and pelleted. The cells were then suspended and fixed overnight at 4 °C in 2% glutaraldehyde with 1% tannic acid in 0.1m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.3. The cells were rinsed 3 times in the sodium cacodylate buffer and then incubated in 2% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were then rinsed 3 times in distilled water and exposed to 1% uranyl acetate in water for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were rinsed twice in distilled water, spun down into 3% agarose at 45 °C, and cooled to form blocks. The agarose blocks were dehydrated in graded steps of acetone and embedded in Spurr's low viscosity media. Following polymerization overnight at 65 °C, 80-nm sections were cut on a Reighert-Jung Ultra cut E ultramicrotome and picked up on copper grids. The grids were post-stained in uranyl acetate and bismuth subnitrate. The sections were observed in a Hitachi 7000 STEM and micrographs recorded on Kodak 4489 sheet film. Jurkat cells (8 × 106) were plated in 25-cm2 polystyrene flasks. After treatment the cells were lysed in 100 μl of cell lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). After 30 min on ice, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). Equivalent amounts of protein (40 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gel was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. PARP was visualized by staining with a mouse monoclonal antibody (C-2–10, Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) and enhanced chemiluminescence. All experiments using Western blotting were repeated three times (cytochrome c, MDH, Bid, Bik, Bak, Bad, Cox4, β-actin, and PARP as above). The immunoblots from each experiment were scanned with an Image Station-440CS densitometer (Eastman Kodak Co.). The relative densities with respect to the appropriate controls were calculated. In all cases below, statements regarding changes in the intensity of Western blot staining are based on comparisons of the calculated relative densities rather than simply from visual inspection of the gels. The Jurkat cell is a human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma that is frequently used to study the mechanisms mediating Fas-induced apoptosis. Accordingly, the content of proapoptotic proteins in these cells is of significant concern. Fig. 1 A contrasts the Jurkat cell with a malignant human epithelial cell, the HeLa cell, with respect to the content of Bax, Bid, Bik, and Bak. Jurkat cells contain Bid, Bak, and Bik but not Bax. By contrast, HeLa cells contain predominantly Bax and Bak. In the HeLa cell, there is no Bik and much less Bid than in the Jurkat cell. The absence of the Bax protein in Jurkat cells was reported (21Brimmell M. Mendiola R. Mangion J. Packham G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1803-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) to be a consequence of single base deletions and additions in a polyguanine tract within the Bax open reading frame. RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA for Bax, Bid, and Bak in both the Jurkat and HeLa cells. A 579-bp species that corresponds to Bax α RNA was present in HeLa cells but not in Jurkat cells (Fig. 1 B). By contrast, Jurkat cells contain a 433-bp species that likely represents the RNA of the Bax δ isoform. Bid and Bak RNA were readily detectable in both Jurkat and HeLa cells (Fig. 1 B). There was no detectable Bax δ protein in the Jurkat cells (data not shown). Interestingly, the Bax δ protein was not detectable in DG75 cells that overexpressed Bax δ RNA (21Brimmell M. Mendiola R. Mangion J. Packham G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1803-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), a finding suggesting that the mRNA was unstable. Alternatively, at least in the Jurkat cells, the Bax δ gene may be mutated. Bid was cleaved by activated caspase-8 upon the initiation of Fas signaling (7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 8Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J.

Barber M.J. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39474-39481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We report here a dissociation of the cleavage of Bid from the killing of Jurkat cells upon Fas receptor activation. Fig. 2 details the content of full-length Bid (p22) and its main cleavage product (p15) under a number of experimental conditions. Within 3 h of the activation of the Fas receptor by an anti-Fas antibody, the content of full-length Bid was reduced, and the cleavage fragment was present. By 6 h both these changes were more prominent. The caspase-8 inhibitor IETD (22Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) prevented the accumulation of the p15 cleavage fragment and maintained the content of full-length Bid at both 3 and 6 h. The PARP inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide had no effect on the cleavage of Bid. With both IETD and 3-AB, no evidence of Bid cleavage was seen at either 3 or 6 h. The effect of these same manipulations on the extent of cell killing is shown in Fig. 3. Within 6 h of activation of the Fas receptor, 60% of the Jurkat cells were dead. IETD completely prevented the cell killing. In the presence, however, of both IETD and 3-AB, the cell killing was restored. In other words, the addition of 3-AB reversed the ability of the caspase inhibitor to prevent the cell killing. Importantly, 3-AB alone (in the absence of IETD) had no effect on the rate or extent of the cell killing (data not shown). PARP is another well documented substrate for activated caspases, and PARP cleavage occurred upon activation of the Fas receptor (23Tewari M.L.T. Quan K. O'Rourke S. Desnoyers Z. Zeng D.R. Beidler G.G. Poirier B.S. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Fig.4 illustrates that the details of PARP cleavage were similar to those of the cleavage of Bid in Fig. 2. PARP cleavage was readily evident within 2 h and complete within 4 h. IETD prevented PARP cleavage, whereas 3-AB alone did not. As with the cleavage of Bid (Fig. 2), PARP cleavage was not seen in the presence of both IETD and 3-AB. The data in Figs. 2 and 3 document a condition under which the Jurkat cells were killed in the absence of Bid cleavage upon activation of the Fas receptor. Rather, we show below that the cell killing correlated more closely with the translocation of full-length Bid from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Fig.5 details the mitochondrial content of both full-length Bid (p22) and its cleavage fragment (p15). Within 2 h of activation of the Fas receptor, the content of full-length Bid had increased, as well as that of the cleavage product. The caspase-8 inhibitor IETD prevented both the accumulation of full-length Bid and its cleavage product. In the presence of both IETD and 3-AB, there was more full-length Bid associated with the mitochondria than occurred with IETD alone. In other words, the ability of 3-AB to reverse the protection afforded by the caspase inhibitor IETD correlated with the translocation of full-length Bid to the mitochondria. Fig. 5 also shows that the content of the mitochondrial marker Cox4 did not vary under the"
https://openalex.org/W2137188051,"The LXR nuclear receptors are intracellular sensors of cholesterol excess and are activated by various oxysterols. LXRs have been shown to regulate multiple genes of lipid metabolism, including ABCA1 (formerly known asABC1). ABCA1 is a lipid pump that effluxes cholesterol and phospholipid out of cells. ABCA1 deficiency causes extremely low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, demonstrating the importance of ABCA1 in the formation of HDL. The present work shows that the acetyl-podocarpic dimer (APD) is a potent, selective agonist for both LXRα (NR1H3) and LXRβ (NR1H2). In transient transactivation assays, APD was ∼1000-fold more potent, and yielded ∼6-fold greater maximal stimulation, than the widely used LXR agonist 22-(R)-hydroxycholesterol. APD induced ABCA1mRNA levels, and increased efflux of both cholesterol and phospholipid, from multiple cell types. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements demonstrated that APD stimulated efflux of endogenous cholesterol, eliminating any possible artifacts of cholesterol labeling. For both mRNA induction and stimulation of cholesterol efflux, APD was found to be more effective than was cholesterol loading. Taken together, these data show that APD is a more effective LXR agonist than endogenous oxysterols. LXR agonists may therefore be useful for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, especially in the context of low HDL levels."

Mice that are deficient in adipose tissue expression of lipoprotein lipase (LpL) also have less fat, but only when crossed with ob/ob mice. We hypothesized that the VLDLr, a protein that will bind and transport LpL, is required for optimal LpL actions in vivo and that hypertriglyceridemia due to VLDLr deficiency is exacerbated by either LpL deficiency or VLDL overproduction. Fasted VLDLr knockout (VLDLr0) mice were more hypertriglyceridemic than controls (2-fold greater triglyceride levels). The hypertriglyceridemia due to VLDLr0 was even more evident when VLDLr0 mice were crossed with heterozygous LpL-deficient (LpL1) and human apolipoprotein B (apoB) transgenic mice. This was due to an increase in apoB48-containing VLDL. [3H]VLDL turnover studies showed that VLDL-triglyceride clearance in VLDLr0/LpL1 mice was impaired by 50% compared with LpL1 mice.

Infection of mice with an adenovirus-expressing receptor-associated protein, an inhibitor of the VLDLr, reduced LpL activity in wild type but not VLDLr0 mice.

Despite the similarity of the VLDLr to other molecules that regulate circulating plasma lipoproteins, the role of this receptor in triglyceride (TG) and/or cholesterol metabolism in vivo is still unclear. In an effort to understand the physiologic function of the VLDLr, a number of genetically modulated mice have been produced (5Frykman P.K. Brown M.S. Yamamoto T. Goldstein J.L. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 6Tacken P.J. Teusink B. Jong M.C. Harats D. Havekes L.M. van Dijk K.W. Hofker M.H. J.

When the VLDLr was knocked out, the resulting mice were fertile and had no obvious lipoprotein metabolic abnormalities (5Frykman P.K. Brown M.S. Yamamoto T. Goldstein J.L. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

They did, however, appear to gain weight more slowly postnatally, a period in which pups ingest only milk and, therefore, have fat as their primary source of calories. In addition, VLDLr knockout (VLDLr0) mice were resistant to the development of obesity both when fed a high calorie diet (5Frykman P.K. Brown M.S. Yamamoto T. Goldstein J.L. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and when crossed with ob/ob mice (7Goudriaan J.R. Tacken P.J. Dahlmans V.E. Gijbels M.J. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Jong M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LDL receptor knockout mice that also had a knockout of the VLDLr developed increased plasma TG levels when fed a high fat diet (6Tacken P.J. Teusink B. Jong M.C. Harats D.

Prolonged fasting in chow-fed mice also led to hypertriglyceridemia (7Goudriaan J.R. Tacken P.J. Dahlmans V.E. Gijbels M.J. van Dijk K.W. Havekes L.M. Jong M.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mechanism responsible for the changes in obesity and the hypertriglyceridemia is unknown. In many respects, these phenotypes resemble those of mice with defects in LpL production. Mice that only produce LpL in the liver have neonatal growth retardation (8Merkel M. Weinstock P.H. Chajek-Shaul T. Radner H. Yin B. Breslow J.L. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Those expressing LpL in muscle but not adipose tissue are resistant to obesity (9Weinstock P.H. Levak-Frank S. Hudgins L.C. Radner H. Friedman J.M. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10261-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Because VLDLr and LpL interact, we postulated that VLDLr deficiency leads to abnormal LpL regulation. Further support for this hypothesis comes from studies of overexpression of receptor-associated protein (RAP) in mice. RAP is a 39-kDa protein that inhibits the LDL receptor-related protein and the VLDLr (10Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of RAP via adenoviral infection led to hypertriglyceridemia in a number of mouse models (12Veniant M.M.

This hypertriglyceridemia was associated with a decrease in postheparin plasma LpL activity. Thus, inhibition of the VLDLr or some other action of RAP was responsible for changes in LpL activity. RAP does not directly inhibit LpL activity (4Obunike J.C. Lutz E.P. Li Z. Paka L. Katopodis T. Strickland D.K. Kozarsky K.F. Pillarisetti S. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol.

It does, however, block the removal of LpL protein from the bloodstream, leading to high plasma levels of inactive LpL. The VLDLr is uniquely expressed in sites that are involved in regulation of LpL and, consequently, the peripheral metabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins. In most endothelial cells, the VLDLr is the most highly expressed of the LDL receptor family members (15Tacken P.J. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. van Dijk K.W. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). VLDLr is increased in hearts during fasting (16Kwok S. Singh-Bist A. Natu V. Kraemer F.B. Horm. Metab. Res. 1997; 29: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a time when LpL activity increases and allows more delivery of fatty acids. To test the hypothesis that the VLDLr regulates catabolism of TG-rich lipoproteins, we studied lipoproteins in VLDLr0 mice and then crossed these animals with mice that had a heterozygous deletion of LpL (denoted LpL1) and mice that overexpress human apoB (HuB). Previous studies showed that the effects of transgenic LpL expression on plasma lipoproteins were most evident when placed on the LpL1 background (17Merkel M. Kako Y. Radner H. Cho I.S. Ramasamy R.

This was presumably because normal mice produce so much LpL that it is not rate-limiting in most circumstances. We found that VLDLr0 leads to defective VLDL catabolism associated with reduced activity of LpL. VLDLr0 (5Frykman P.K. Brown M.S. Yamamoto T. Goldstein J.L. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To obtain VLDLr0/LpL1 mice, VLDLr0 mice were cross-bred with LpL1 mice to produce mice that were heterozygous for the disrupted alleles of both VLDLr (VLDLr1) and LpL (LpL1). VLDLr1/LpL1 mice were further bred to VLDLr1 littermates to produce a set of wild type, VLDLr0, LpL1, and VLDLr0/LpL1 mice. To produce VLDLr0 mice overexpressing HuB (VLDLr0/HuB), VLDLr0 mice were bred with HuB transgenic mice. The resultant pups, which overexpressed the HuB transgene and were heterozygous for the mutant VLDLr locus, were further bred to VLDLr1 littermates to obtain VLDLr0 mice with the HuB transgene. Three-month-old male mice fasted for 16 h were used for experiments, and littermates were used as controls. The parent VLDLr0 mice were F2 hybrid between 129/Sv and C57BL/6; LpL1 and HuB mice were back-crossed to C57BL/6 seven times. Therefore, 75% of the genetic background of the mice was derived from C57BL/6 and 25% from 129/Sv strains. All mice were housed in a temperature-controlled (25 °C) facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and given free access to food. Two diets were used: (i) normal chow diet that contained 4.5% (w/w) fat with 0.02% (w/w) cholesterol and (ii) high fat/cholic acid diet containing 1.25% (w/w) cholesterol, 15% (w/w) fat, and 0.5% (w/w) cholic acid (20Paigen B.

Lipoproteins, VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml), intermediate/low density lipoproteins (IDL/LDL) (d = 1.006–1.063 g/ml), and high density lipoproteins (HDL) (d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml), were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation using a TLA 100 rotor (Beckman Instruments). Cholesterol and TG concentrations in plasma or lipoprotein fractions were determined enzymatically by kits (Sigma) in duplicate. Fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) analyses of plasma lipoproteins were performed as described (21Kako Y. Huang L.S. Yang J. Katopodis T. Ramakrishnan R. Goldberg I.J. J.

Total RNA was isolated from hearts of LpL1 and VLDLr0/LpL1 mice using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Ten μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing formamide and transfer to a nylon filter (Hybond N; Amersham Biosciences). A murine LpL cDNA probe was kindly provided by C. F. Semenkovich (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and radiolabeled with [α-32P]deoxy-CTP.

For Ad-RAP infection, 2.0 × 109 plaque-forming units in a total volume of 100 μl (diluted with phosphate-buffered saline) were injected into tail veins of wild type and VLDLr0 mice. Eighty μl of pre- and postheparin blood was obtained 5 days before and after virus injection. Plasma lipids and postheparin plasma LpL activity were measured as described above. Western blot was performed to verify that each of these mice had a high level of RAP in the circulation. At the age of 3 months, HuB and VLDLr0/HuB male mice were fed a high fat/cholic acid diet. Blood was taken after 16 weeks, and lipoprotein profiles were determined. Mice were sacrificed at 16 weeks, and atherosclerosis was determined as described previously (29Voyiaziakis E. Goldberg I.J.

Student's t test and analysis of variance were used to compare the mean values between two and four groups, respectively. Plasma lipids and lipoprotein levels were compared between wild type, VLDLr0, LpL1, and VLDLr0/LpL1 mice. VLDLr0 mice had 2.2-fold greater levels of plasma TG than wild type mice and VLDLr0/LpL1 mice had 1.8-fold higher TG levels than LpL1 mice (Table I). Cholesterol levels were significantly higher in VLDLr0 than wild type mice, but not VLDLr0/LpL1 compared with LpL1 mice. FFA and glucose levels did not differ between the four genotypes (TableII). VLDLr0/HuB mice had >2-fold greater TG levels than HuB mice, 340 versus 162 mg/dl (Table I). Thus, VLDLr0 led to more TG when bred onto LpL1, a model of defective lipoprotein metabolism, and HuB, a model of lipoprotein overproduction.Table IPlasma lipids in VLDLr0, VLDLr0/LpL1, and VLDLr0/HuB micenCholesterolTGmg/dlChowWild type8104 ± 16141 ± 48VLDLr08141 ± 341-ap < 0.05 versus wild type.316 ± 711-bp < 0.01 versus wild type.LpL19146 ± 341-ap < 0.05 versus wild type.296 ± 1171-bp < 0.01 versus wild type.VLDLr0/LpL113151 ± 241-bp < 0.01 versus wild type.544 ± 122 b,cp < 0.01 versus LpL1.,dp < 0.01 versus VLDLr0.ChowHuB5141 ± 22162 ± 21VLDLr0/HuB9135 ± 24340 ± 1251-ep <0.01 versus HuB.HF1-fHF, high fat/cholic acid diet.HuB9453 ± 11979 ± 16VLDLr0/HuB8420 ± 104105 ± 33Blood was taken from 16-h fasted mice.

We also assessed lipids in HuB and VLDLr0/HuB mice fed a high fat/cholic acid-containing diet. Total plasma lipids in the two genotypes were not significantly different (Table I). FPLC analyses on the pooled plasma collected from 3–5 mice are shown in Fig.1. Cholesterol and TG levels in the VLDL fraction were increased in VLDLr0 compared with wild type mice (Fig. 1,A and B). A similar effect of VLDLr deficiency was noted when VLDLr0/LpL1 mice were compared with LpL1 mice (Fig. 1,C and D). There were no changes in IDL/LDL and HDL fractions between the two types of mice. VLDLr0/HuB mice also had much greater cholesterol and TG levels in the VLDL fraction than HuB mice (Fig. 1, E and F). There were no changes in HDL. Despite the lack of changes in total plasma lipids with high fat feeding (Table I), lipoprotein distribution was altered in VLDLr0/HuB mice. They had less IDL/LDL cholesterol and more VLDL-TG than HuB mice (Fig. 1, G and H). Lipoprotein analysis by ultracentrifugation was also performed as a second method of assessing the distribution of lipoproteins in plasma. TG levels in isolated VLDL were increased by 2.5-fold in VLDLr0/LpL1 mice compared with those in LpL1 mice (382 versus 152 mg/dl,p < 0.01) (Table III). VLDL-cholesterol levels were also significantly higher in VLDLr0/LpL1 mice (39 versus 22 mg/dl, p < 0.01). Therefore, the ratio of TG/cholesterol in VLDL increased from 6.9 to 9.8. There were no significant differences in HDL or IDL/LDL. Similarly, VLDLr0/HuB mice had >3-fold more VLDL-TG than HuB mice (258versus 84 mg/dl, p < 0.01), the ratio of VLDL-TG/cholesterol increased from 7 to 9.6, and there was no change in IDL/LDL or HDL (Table III). With high fat feeding, the increase in VLDL and reduction of IDL/LDL noted by FPLC was confirmed (Table III). Thus, VLDLr0 mice had a specific increase in VLDL that must have resulted from either increased VLDL production or decreased catabolism.Table IIIPlasma lipoproteins in VLDLr0/LpL1 and VLDLr0/HuB micenCholesterolTGVLDLIDL/LDLHDLVLDLIDL/LDLmg/dlmg/dlChowmg/dlLpL1922 ± 922 ± 1176 ± 18152 ± 5658 ± 24VLDLr0/LpL11339 ± 93-ap < 0.01 versus LpL1.20 ± 677 ± 13382 ± 1113-ap < 0.01 versus LpL1.60 ± 15ChowHuB512 ± 333 ± 1075 ± 984 ± 2067 ± 16VLDLr0/HuB927 ± 83-bp ≤ 0.01 versus HuB.26 ± 864 ± 11258 ± 1063-bp ≤ 0.01 versus HuB.65 ± 10HF3-cHigh fat/cholic acid diet.HuB9125 ± 48249 ± 9274 ± 1237 ± 729 ± 10VLDLr0/HuB8179 ± 73163 ± 553-bp ≤ 0.01 versus HuB.64 ± 1165 ± 233-bp ≤ 0.01 versus HuB.28 ± 10Lipoproteins were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation individually.

The hypertriglyceridemia found in LpL1 and VLDLr0/LpL1 mice was associated with an increase in apoB48-containing VLDL (Fig. 2). VLDLr0/LpL1 mice had more apoB48-VLDL than either LpL1 or wild type mice. This increase in apoB48 was not found in IDL/LDL and was not associated with a change in LDL receptor expression levels between LpL1 and VLDLr0/LpL1 mice (data not shown). VLDLr deficiency led to slower clearance of radiolabeled VLDL. The most rapid turnover occurred in wild type mice (fraction catabolic rate, 11.2 ± 2.3 pools/h). VLDLr0 and LpL1 mice cleared the tracer at almost identical rates, 6.2 ± 2.1 and 7.2 ± 2.2 pools/h, respectively (p = 0.4). VLDL removal was significantly slower in VLDLr0/LpL1 mice than that in either VLDLr0 or LpL1 mice (Fig.3 A) (fraction catabolic rate of LpL1/VLDLr0 = 3.6 ± 1.5 pools/h, p < 0.03 compared with VLDLr0 and p < 0.01 compared with LpL1). This corresponded to a significant reduction in tissue uptake of labeled VLDL by heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 3 B); differences in tracer uptake into adipose and liver were not significant. It should be noted (see Fig. 2) that most of the VLDL in this preparation contains apoB48. Thus, these changes were consistent with a defect in VLDL lipolysis leading to reduced muscle TG uptake. VLDLr0 mice had significantly less postheparin plasma LpL activity. VLDLr0 mice had 37% less activity than wild type, and VLDLr0/LpL1 mice had 26% less activity than LpL1 mice (Fig. 4 A). Postheparin plasma LpL mass paralleled these changes in activity (Fig.4 B). VLDLr0/HuB mice also had lower LpL activity and mass than HuB mice (Fig. 4, C and D). Therefore, the VLDL increase with loss of the VLDLr corresponded to changes in LpL. With fasting, muscle becomes relatively more important than adipose as a source of LpL activity (30Zechner R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine whether the reduced LpL was associated with changes in only one tissue (e.g. muscle), LpL activity was measured in tissues obtained from LpL1 and VLDLr0/LpL1 mice. Both heart and skeletal muscle LpL activities were significantly lower in VLDLr0/LpL1 than LpL1 mice; adipose LpL was also reduced by 26%, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Fig.5 A). Although LpL protein in skeletal muscle and adipose could not be assessed due to its lower protein levels in both groups of mice, VLDLr0/LpL1 mice had significantly less LpL protein in heart than LpL1 mice (Fig.5 B). Northern blot analysis showed no difference in LpL mRNA in the heart (Fig. 5 C). Thus, reduced LpL appeared to be due to a posttranscriptional process. Previous studies have shown that RAP leads to reduced LpL activity compared with control virus (14van Vlijmen B.J. Rohlmann A. Page S.T. Bensadoun A. Bos I.S. van Berkel T.J. Havekes L.M. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35219-35226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To test whether this was due to inhibition of the VLDLr, changes in LpL with RAP were assessed in mice deficient in VLDLr. Infection with Ad-RAP led to a 31% decrease in LpL activity in wild type mice (Fig. 6 A) but no change in LpL activity in VLDLr0 mice. The effects of RAP on plasma TG levels reflected, in part, the changes in LpL activity (Fig. 6 B). A greater increase in TG occurred in wild type mice that also had greater reduction of LpL. However, VLDLr0 mice also had an increase in plasma TG. Thus, RAP probably increases plasma lipids due both to changes in LpL and to effects on lipoprotein receptors. It has been postulated that VLDLr expression in macrophages allows for foam cell development in atherosclerotic lesions (31Kosaka S. Takahashi S. Masamura K. Kanehara H. Sakai J. Tohda G. Okada E.

Atherosclerosis was, however, not different between HuB and VLDLr0/HuB mice (37,000 versus27,000 μm2, p = 0.5, Fig.7) after 4 months of an atherogenic diet.

Genet. 1996; 13: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). BSC1 belongs to the superfamily of electroneutral cation-coupled chloride cotransporters for which eight genes have been identified (8.Gamba G. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Two of these genes encode for Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporters: BSC1, a kidney-specific cotransporter expressed only at the apical membrane of the TALH, and BSC2 (also known as NKCC1), a ubiquitously expressed gene at the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells, which is also expressed in several nonepithelial cells. The degree of identity between these proteins is ∼60%, and in humans, the BSC1 and BSC2 genes are localized in chromosomes 15 and 5, respectively. The murine BSC1 gene gives rise to six alternatively spliced isoforms caused by the combination of two splicing mechanisms. One results from the existence of three mutually exclusive cassette exons of 96 bp named A, B, and F, which encode 31 amino acid residues that are part of the putative transmembrane segment 2 and the connecting segment between transmembrane segments 2 and 3 (6.Payne J A Forbush III B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4544-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 7.Igarashi P Vanden Heuver G B Payne J A Forbush III B. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Fluid Electrolyte Physiol. 1995; 269: F406-F418Crossref Google Scholar). The other splicing mechanism is a polyadenylation signal in the intron between exons 16 and 17 producing a COOH-terminal truncated isoform that lacks the last 327 amino acid residues but contains 55 residues at the end which are not present in the longer isoforms (9.Mount D.B. Baekgard A. Hall A.E. Plata C. Xu J. Beier D.R. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 276: F347-F358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the two splicing mechanisms are independent of each other, six isoforms are present in the TALH cells: three isoforms with a long COOH-terminal domain (A, B, and F) and three with a short COOH-terminal domain (A, B, and F) (9.Mount D.B. Baekgard A. Hall A.E. Plata C. Xu J. Beier D.R. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 276: F347-F358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Gamba G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F781-F794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The splicing at the COOH-terminal domain in mouse BSC1 has remarkable effects on the cotransporter properties. Whereas the three longer isoforms (A, B, and F) function as bumetanide-sensitive Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporters which are partially inhibited by hypotonicity (5.Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M.

Renal Physiol. 1999; 276: F359-F366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the shorter isoform operates as a K+-independent, but nevertheless bumetanide-sensitive Na+:Cl− cotransporter that is activated by hypotonicity (12.Plata C. Meade P. Hall A.E. Welch R.C. Vazquez N. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F574-F582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both transporters are equally sensitive to loop diuretics. In addition, the shorter isoform is sensitive to cAMP and exerts a dominant-negative effect upon the Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter which can be abrogated by cAMP (11.Plata C. Mount D.B. Rubio V. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 276: F359-F366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, splicing of the COOH-terminal domain changes the type and stoichiometry of the cotransported ions, the response to cell swelling, and provides a potential regulatory mechanism of the Na+:K+:2Cl−cotransporter activity. The functional effect of splicing of the mutually exclusive cassette exons A, B, and F, encoding part of the transmembrane segment 2, is still unknown, but it has been suggested that the exons could affect the transport properties of the cotransporter.

Acta. 1985; 821: 461-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) when mTALH was used. In this regard, it has been shown that the splicing isoforms A, B, and F exhibit axial distribution along the TALH. The F isoform is absent in the cTALH and present in the mTALH, with higher expression in the inner stripe of the outer medulla. The A isoform is present in both cTALH and mTALH, with higher expression in the outer stripe of the outer medulla, and the B isoform is present only in the cTALH (6.Payne J A Forbush III B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4544-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 7.Igarashi P Vanden Heuver G B Payne J A Forbush III B. Am. J. Physiol.

Thus heterogeneity in the salt transport along the TALH could be caused by the axial distribution of the three isoforms A, B, and F of the Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter. However, the functional characterization of these isoforms has not been addressed. In the present study, we show a functional characterization of the longer isoforms A, B, and F of the murine Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter using the Xenopus laevis oocytes as an heterologous expression system. Our data revealed significant differences in the affinity for Na+, K+, and Cl− among isoforms as well as in the sensitivity to bumetanide and response to hypotonicity. Adult female X. laevis frogs were obtained from Nasco (Fort Atkinson, MI). Oocytes were harvested by surgery under 0.17% tricaine and incubated for 1 h in the frog Ringer ND96 (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl, and 5 HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4) in the presence of 2 mg/ml collagenase B. Then, oocytes were washed four times in ND96, defolliculated manually, and incubated overnight in the same medium at 18 °C supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate and 5 mg/100 ml gentamicin. The next day, stage V–VI oocytes (22.Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1970; 136: 153-180Crossref Scopus (1428) Google Scholar) were injected with 50 nl of water or cRNA at a concentration of 0.5 μg/μl (25 ng of cRNA/oocyte). After injection, oocytes were incubated for 3–4 days in ND96 with sodium pyruvate and gentamicin. The incubation medium was changed every 24 h. The night before the uptake experiments were performed, oocytes were incubated in Cl−-free ND96 (in mm: 96 sodium isothionate, 2 potassium gluconate, 1.8 calcium gluconate, 1.0 magnesium gluconate, 5 mm HEPES, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, 5 mg% gentamicin, pH 7.4) (23.Gamba G. Saltzberg S.N. Lombardi M. Miyanoshita A. Lytton J. Hediger M.A. Brenner B.M. Hebert S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2749-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The cloning and preparation of mouse mBSC1 cDNA used in the study have been reported previously (9.Mount D.B. Baekgard A. Hall A.E. Plata C. Xu J. Beier D.R. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 276: F347-F358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, mBSC1-F and mBSC1-A isoforms were cloned by homology from a mouse outer medulla cDNA library, using the flounder thiazide-sensitive Na+:Cl− cotransporter cDNA as a probe (5.Gamba G.

Xu J. Beier D.R. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 276: F347-F358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The short B cassette cDNA was lengthened by PCR and ligated into the BsmI and NsiI sites of the mBSC1-F isoform (9.Mount D.B. Baekgard A. Hall A.E. Plata C. Xu J. Beier D.R. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 276: F347-F358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the mBSC1 isoforms used in the present study are inserted in the plasmid pSPORT1 (Invitrogen). To prepare cRNA, each isoform cDNA was linearized at the 3′-end using NotI from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and cRNA was transcribed in vitro, using the T7 RNA polymerase mMESSAGE kit (Ambion). Transcription product integrity was confirmed on agarose gels, and the concentration was determined by absorbance reading at 260 nm (DU 640, Beckman, Fullerton, CA). cRNA was stored frozen in aliquots at −80 °C until used. The function of the Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter was assessed by measuring tracer 86Rb+ uptake (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in groups of at least 15 oocytes following this general protocol: a 30-min incubation in isotonic K+- and Cl−-free medium (in mm: 96 sodium gluconate, 6.0 calcium gluconate, 1.0 magnesium gluconate, 5 HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4) with 1 mm ouabain followed by a 60-min uptake period in the presence of Na+, K+, and Cl−. For most experiments the isotonic medium contained (in mm): 96 NaCl, 10 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, pH 7.4, supplemented with 1 mmouabain and 2.0 μCi of 86Rb+. Because X. laevis oocytes express an endogenous Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter (5.Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S. Hediger M.A. Hebert S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17713-17722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) every experiment included the appropriate groups of water-injected oocytes. To analyze the ion transport kinetics of the Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter isoforms, experiments were performed varying the concentrations of Na+, K+ and Cl−. For Na+ kinetics, the extracellular K+ and Cl− concentrations were fixed at 10 and 90 mm, respectively. For K+ kinetics, Na+ and Cl− were fixed at 90 mm, and for Cl− kinetics the Na+ and K+concentrations were fixed at 90 and 10 mm, respectively. To maintain osmolarity and ionic strength, N-methyl-d-glucamine was used as an Na+ and K+ substitute, and gluconate was used as a Cl− substitute. The transport kinetics for a single ion (Na+, K+, or Cl−) was assessed for the three mBSC1 isoforms at the same time, with the same batch of oocytes and solutions. In the same experiment uptake was also measured for each point in water-injected oocytes (data not shown), and the mean values for water groups were subtracted in corresponding mBSC1 groups to analyze only the 86Rb+ uptake because of the injected mBSC1 isoform. Kinetic analysis was performed by estimating the EC50 values for each ion. The EC50 values were calculated from log[ion concentration] versus V/Vmax plots using GraphPad Prism software and an uphill dose-response equation with variable slope (the latter allows the Hill slope to vary from unity). The sensitivity and kinetics for bumetanide were assessed by exposing groups of mBSC1 cRNA-injected oocytes to bumetanide at concentrations varying from 10−9 to 10−4m. The desired concentration of the loop diuretic was present in both the incubation and uptake periods. Finally, we also assessed the effect of osmolarity upon the function of mBSC1 isoforms using the following conditions during uptake: hypotonicity of 160, isotonicity of 210, and hypertonicity of 260 mosmol/kg. For these experiments the three mBSC1 isoforms were also analyzed at the same time, and all solutions contained 65 mm NaCl and 5 mm KCl, which resulted in an osmolarity of ∼ 160 mosmol/kg. To prepare the solutions with 210 and 260 mosmol/kg we added 45 and 90 mmsucrose, respectively. All uptakes were performed at 30 °C. At the end of the uptake period, oocytes were washed five times in ice-cold uptake solution without isotope to remove extracellular fluid tracer. After the oocytes were dissolved in 10% SDS, tracer activity was determined for each oocyte by β-scintillation counting. The surface expression of each mBSC1 isoform in the oocyte plasma membrane was measured by fluorescence using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-mBSC1 fusion constructs. To make the GFP-mBSC1 fusion constructs, the fragment containing the full-length mBSC1-A cDNA was removed from pSPORT1-BSC1, with the restriction enzymes SalI and NotI, gel isolated and ligated into pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), resulting in the plasmid pEGFP-C1/BSC1, which contains an in-frame fusion of the mBSC1-A ligated into the COOH terminus of GFP. Then, the cDNA fragment containing the GFP-mBSC1-A was removed from pEGFP-C1/BSC1 by restriction enzyme digestion with AgeI and NotI and ligated into pSPORT1. To obtain GFP-mBSC1-B and GFP-mBSC1-F, the fragment SalI to NsiI of GFP-mBSC1-A, which contains the entire GFP sequence and part of mBSC1 sequence before the second transmembrane domain, was ligated into mBSC1-B and mBSC1-F, which were already in pSPORT1 (9.Mount D.B. Baekgard A. Hall A.E. Plata C. Xu J. Beier D.R. Gamba G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1999; 276: F347-F358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GFP-mBSC1-A, GFP-mBSC1-B, and GFP-mBSC1-F cRNA was transcribed in vitro and microinjected into X. laevis oocytes (25 ng/oocyte). Water and non-GFP mBSC1-F-injected oocytes were used as control. After 4 days of incubation in regular ND96, oocytes were monitored for GFP fluorescence using a Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope (objective lens ×10, Nikon). Light of excitation wavelength 488 nm and emission 515–565 nm was used to visualize GFP fluorescence. Plasma membrane fluorescence was quantified by determining the pixel intensity around the entire oocyte circumference using SigmaScan Pro image analysis software. The significance of the differences between groups was tested by one-way analysis of variance with multiple comparison using Bonferroni correction or by the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks with the Dunn method for multiple comparison procedures, as needed. The results are presented as mean ± S.E. We and others (5.Gamba G. Miyanoshita A. Lombardi M. Lytton J. Lee W.S. Hediger M.A. Hebert S.C. J. Biol.

Res. 2000; 31: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) have shown previously that Xenopus oocytes exhibit an endogenous expression of the bumetanide-sensitive Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter. As shown in Fig. 1,86Rb+ uptake in H2O-injected oocytes was 2,113 ± 346 pmol·oocyte−1·h−1 in control conditions and 417 ± 202 pmol·oocyte−1·h−1 in the presence of a 10−4m concentration of the loop diuretic bumetanide. Background 86Rb+uptake was, however, increased by microinjection of X. laevis oocytes with mBSC1-A, mBSC1-B, or mBSC1-F cRNA. The uptake was reduced significantly in all groups in the presence of bumetanide. Thus, to analyze the 86Rb+ uptake induced only by each mBSC1 isoform, in all experiments performed for this study,86Rb+ uptake was measured simultaneously in water-injected oocytes, and the mean values for the water groups were subtracted in corresponding mBSC1 groups. As shown in Fig. 1, 86Rb+ uptake in mBSC1-A-injected oocytes was 19,395 ± 1,997 pmol·oocyte−1·h−1, whereas in mBSC1-B oocytes it was 13,229 ± 1,640 pmol·oocyte−1·h−1, and in mBSC1-F it was 12,088 ± 1,561 pmol·oocyte−1·h−1. Thus 86Rb+ uptake in the mBSC1-A isoform is significantly higher than in mBSC1-B and mBSC1-F isoforms (p < 0.001). The results shown in Fig. 1 are the pooled data from 11 different experiments, using oocytes from different frogs, with an average of 18 oocytes/group in each experiment. The cRNA used was obtained from three different batches, and every time oocytes were injected with the same amount of cRNA (25 ng/oocyte). The cDNA of the three isoforms used were inserted in the same vector (pSPORT1), contained the same 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions, and cRNA was transcribed in vitro for the three isoforms simultaneously, using the same T7 RNA polymerase. Thus, differences among isoforms in Fig. 1 are unlikely to be the result of injecting mBSC1-A oocytes with a better quality cRNA, with higher concentration of cRNA/oocyte or that mBSC1-A cRNA was better translated than the other two. Instead, these results suggest that the mBSC1-A isoform exhibits either higher surface expression or higher capacity of transport than the mBSC1-B and mBSC1-F isoforms. To determine whether the differences in functional expression were caused by variation in the surface expression of the Na+:K+:2Cl− cotransporter isoforms, X. laevis oocytes injected with GPF-mBSC1-A, GFP-mBSC1-B, or GFP-mBSC1-F cRNA isoforms were analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Figs. 2, A–D, present a representative picture of oocytes injected with each isoform, and Fig. 2Eshows the result of these experiments in which at least 40 oocytes/isoform were evaluated. As shown in Fig. 2E, although numbers were smaller on mBSC1-F-injected oocytes (31,212 ± 4,165; n = 48) than in those injected with mBSC1-A (48,888 ± 8,042; n = 50) or mBSC1-B (43,995 ± 8,495; n = 40), analysis of variance showed no significant differences in surface expression among the three isoforms. Thus, under our experimental conditions it is unlikely that the type of mutually exclusive cassette exon affects the surface expression of the cotransporter in oocytes. This observation supports the hypothesis from Fig. 1 that mBSC1-A might be the isoform with the highest capacity of transport. The kinetic transport properties for each ion were assessed for the three isoforms simultaneously, in the same batch of injected oocytes. Fig. 3A shows the Na+transport kinetics of each isoform, and panels B, C, and D depict the Hill coefficient plots for Na+ in mBSC1-B, mBSC1-A, and mBSC1-F, respectively. The Na+ dependence of 86Rb+ uptake was assessed with fixed concentrations of K+ and Cl− at 10 and 96 mm, respectively, with changing concentrations of Na+ from 0 to 80 mm.86Rb+ uptake increased as the Na+concentration was increased until a plateau phase was reached, compatible with Michaelis-Menten behavior. Table I shows the EC50 and Hill coefficient values. The EC50 values for Na+were similar between mBSC1-A and mBSC1-B isoforms but different from the values observed for the mBSC1-F isoform. Fig. 4A shows the K+transport kinetics of each isoform, and panels B, C, and D depict the Hill coefficient plots for K+ in mBSC1-B, mBSC1-A, and mBSC1-F, respectively. The experiments were performed with fixed concentrations of Na+ and Cl− at 96 mm, with increased concentrations of K+ from 0 to 10 mm. The86Rb+ uptake increased as the K+concentration increased in the extracellular medium until a plateau phase was reached. EC50 and Hill coefficients are shown in Table I. As with Na+ transport kinetics, the EC50 values observed in mBSC1-A and mBSC1-B were similar, whereas the EC50 for K+ in mBSC1-F isoform was higher. Fig. 5A depicts the Cl− transport kinetics for each mBSC1 isoform, and panels B, C, and D show the Hill plots for Cl−. These experiments were carried out with Na+ and K+ concentrations fixed at 96 and 10 mm, respectively, with increased Cl−concentrations from 0 to 96 mm.86Rb+ uptake increased as a function of the Cl− concentration. The plateau phase was reached in mBSC1-A and mBSC1-B, but not in mBSC1-F. As shown in Table I, the EC50 value for Cl− was higher in mBSC1-F than in mBSC1-A or mBSC1-B. Hill coefficients for Na+ and K+ in the three isoforms were close to unity, whereas Hill coefficients for Cl− were above unity, consistent with the 1Na+, 1K+, and 2Cl− stoichiometry. As Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 show, in general mBSC1-A and mBSC1-B exhibit very similar kinetic properties for the three cotransported ions, suggesting that affinity for each ion is similar between these two isoforms. In contrast, the EC50 values for Na+, K+, and Cl− in mBSC1-F-injected oocytes were higher, suggesting that this is the isoform with the lowest affinity for the cotransported ions.Table IEC50 values and Hill coefficient for Na+,K+, and Cl− transport in mBSC1 isoformsSodiumPotassiumChlorideEC50HillEC50HillEC50HillmBSC1-B3.0 ± 0.61.09 ± 0.10.76 ± 0.071.00 ± 0.111.6 ± 0.71.53 ± 0.06mBSC1-A5.0 ± 3.91.16 ± 0.10.96 ± 0.160.83 ± 0.0922.2 ± 4.81.93 ± 0.31mBSC1-F20.6 ± 7.20.78 ± 0.11.54 ± 0.160.95 ± 0.0529.2 ± 2.12.85 ± 0.25 Open table in a new tab Figure 4Kinetic transport analysis for K+in mBSC1 isoforms.

Synchronized cells transfected with the aurora A promoter-luciferase constructs revealed that the promoter activity of aurora A increased in the S phase and peaked at G2/M. In addition, we identified a tandem repressor element, CDE/CHR, just downstream of the CTTCCGG element, and mutation within this element led to a loss of cell cycle regulation.

Several members of the aurora/Ipl1p kinase family, such as Ipl1p in S. cerevisiae, aurora B (AIR2) in C. elegans, aurora B (IAL) inDrosophila, and aurora A in Xenopus, play important roles in the entry into mitosis through the phosphorylation of histone H3 (21Giet R.

Human aurora A (also known as aurora2, STK15, BTAK, and AIK) was first identified as a human homologue of the aurora/Ipl1p kinase family: it is cell-cycle regulated, mapped to chromosome 20, and highly expressed in colon and breast cancers and several other tumors (5Sen S.

The full-length aurora A cDNA contains a 1209-bp open reading frame that encodes 403 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 45.8 kDa. Aurora A protein shares 43 and 41% amino acid identities over its entire length and 62 and 49% identities over its kinase domain with Drosophila aurora A and yeast Ipl1p, respectively (7Bischoff J.R.

The 2.4-kb aurora A transcripts are abundant in mitotically active cells, embryonic cells, and meiotically active germ cells (7Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B.

Levels of mRNA, protein, and kinase activity are low in G1/S, accumulate during G2/M, and decrease rapidly after mitosis (7Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B.

Aurora A protein is localized in the centrosomes of interphase cells and in the spindle of mitotic cells (6Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar,7Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M.

Ectopic expression of aurora A leads to an increase in centrosome number, causes catastrophic loss or gain of chromosomes, and then results in either cell death or survival through malignant transformation (6Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Indeed, aurora A is expressed at high levels in human cancer cells and in most human tumor cell lines (5Sen S. Zhou H. White R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2195-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 6Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat.

In contrast, aurora A-deficient cells can form a bipolar mitotic spindle, but chromosomes fail to align on the metaphase plate (27Bischoff J.R. Plowman G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 454-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). These data suggest that aurora A is required for segregation of chromosomes but not for separation of centrosomes. Because this protein seems to play key roles in mitotic events such as chromosome segregation and oncogenesis, the regulatory mechanism of aurora A's G2/M-specific expression has been a focus of interest. Honda et al. (28Honda K. Mihara H. Kato Y. Yamaguchi A. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Furukawa K. Urano T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2812-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) recently reported that aurora A was degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Because the level of aurora A mRNA varies during the cell cycle, another mechanism must be involved in the cell-cycle-dependent expression of aurora A. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of the human aurora A gene. HeLa, NIH3T3, and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone). Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Untransfected and transiently transfected HeLa cells were grown in 12-well plates to 3 × 104 cells/well and synchronized at the G1/S boundary by a double thymidine block protocol previously described (29Rao P.N. Johnson R.T. Nature. 1970; 225: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In brief, thymidine (Sigma) was added to the media to a final concentration of 2 mm as the first block. After a 16-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) and incubated in complete growth media for an additional 8 h at 37 °C. Thymidine then again was added to the media as the second block. After a 16-h block, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, then complete growth media were added to release them from the block. This time point was designated time 0. Cells were harvested at various times and used for laser-scanning cytometry, luciferase assays, electromobility shift assays (EMSAs),1 and Northern blot analysis. To synchronize them at M phase, HeLa cells were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml nocodazole for 16 h. To obtain the aurora A cDNA probe, a 344-bp aurora A cDNA fragment was amplified from the Jurkat cDNA library (CLONTECH) by using the oligonucleotides 5′-ATGGACCGATCTAAAGAAAA-3′ and 5′-GCCAGTTCCTCCTCAGGATT-3′ as primers according to a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides we used were chemically synthesized and column-purified (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). After gel purification, the probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by using a Random Primer Labeling Kit version 2 (Takara). Total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells by using an Isogen RNA extraction kit (Nippon Gene), then electrophoresed and blotted onto a Nytran 0.45 nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeledaurora A cDNA probe. After hybridization, the blots were washed then exposed to XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak) with an intensifying screen at −80 °C (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Laser-scanning cytometry was performed as previously reported (31Miyazaki M. Furuya T. Shiraki A. Sato T. Oga A. Sasaki K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5283-5285PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, HeLa cells were cultured on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and synchronized by using the described double thymidine block and release. At the time 0, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 h from release, the monolayer cells on coverslips were fixed with 100% ethanol. The coverslips then were dipped in a propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) (Sigma) containing 0.2% RNase (Sigma) and placed on a slide with 90% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. DNA content was measured by using a laser-scanning cytometer (LSC101; Olympus). Usually, more than 5000 cells were examined in each sample. The cell-cycle stages were determined according to DNA content. The gene encoding aurora A is mapped on chromosome 20q13.2, and the sequence is available from the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM data base (accession number AL121914). To obtain the gene encoding the 5′-flanking region of the aurora A gene, human genomic DNA was extracted from Jurkat cells by using a method previously reported (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). By using this genomic DNA as template, 1.8 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence of the aurora A gene (including the first exon) was amplified using a standard PCR method with the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GGGGGATCCTCACATGAGAGATTAGAGGC-3′ (sense strand) and 5′-GGGGGATCCCTCTAGCTGTAATAAGTAAC-3′ (antisense strand). ABamHI linker was incorporated into the 5′ end of each primer. The resulting fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript II SK(−) (Strategene) to generate pBlue1486, which was subjected to sequencing and further plasmid constructions. An oligonucleotide (5′-ACCTGCGACCCAAGGACCCAA-3′) that was complementary to the region from +8 to +28 of the aurora A cDNA (6Zhou H. Kuang J. Zhong L. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Sahin A. Brinkley B.R. Sen S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar) was radiolabeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Aliquots (8 μg) of total RNA isolated from HeLa and HEK293 cells were denatured at 65 °C and incubated in a reaction buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.5 ng of the labeled oligonucleotide, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (200 units) (Invitrogen), and deoxynucleotide triphosphates (0.25 mm each) at 37 °C for 1 h. The synthesized cDNAs were denatured at 65 °C and analyzed by electrophoresis thorough 6% acrylamide gels. The same primer was used for the DNA sequence ladder run on the same gels. pGL3-basic (Promega) was used to construct aurora A-pGL hybrids for luciferase assays. To obtain pGL1486, the DNA fragment corresponding to −1486 to +354 of the 5′-flanking sequence was excised from pBlue1486 by usingBamHI. The fragment was gel-purified and cloned into theBalII site of pGL3-basic. The plas- mids pGL415, pGL189, and pGL+17 were constructed from pGL1486 by removing fragments from −1486 to −416, −1486 to −190, and −1486 to +16, respectively, by using appropriate restriction enzymes. To obtain pGL124, pGL90, pGL75, pGL61, and pGL18, the DNA fragments corresponding to −124 to +354, −90 to +354, −75 to +354, −61 to +354, and −18 to +354, respectively, were amplified by PCR with sense oligonucleotide primers that corresponded to the regions −124 to −105 (5′-GGGGGATCCTGGGACTGCCACAGGTCTGG-3′), −90 to −71 (5′-GGGGGATCCCACCACTTCCGGGTTCTTAG-3′), −75 to −56 (5′-GGGGGATCCCTTAGGGAGCAAGTCGCCTG-3′), −61 to −42 (5′-GGGGGATCCCGCCTGCGCGCGGTGTGCGC-3′), and −18 to +2 (5′-GGGGGATCCGGGTTTGTTGTCAACCAATC-3′) and a antisense oligo- nucleotide primer that corresponded to the region +335 to +354 (5′-GGGGGATCCCTCTAGCTGTAATAAGTAAC-3′). A BamHI linker was incorporated into the 5′-end of the sense and antisense primers. pBlue- 1486 was used as the PCR template. The BamHI-digested PCR products were subcloned into the BalII site of pGL3-basic. The mutated constructs pGL189M1, pGL189M2, pGL189M3, pGL189M4, pGL189M5, pGL189M6, pGL189-mCDE, and pGL189-mCHR were obtained by a two-step PCR mutagenesis method (32Chen B. Przybyla A.E. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659PubMed Google Scholar) with the chemically synthesized mutated sense oligonucleotides mPRE1 (5′-GTTGGCTCCATGGCTTCCGGGTT-3′), mPRE2 (5′-GGCTCCACCATGGCCGGGTTCTT-3′), mPRE3 (5′-CACCACTTCGAAGTTCTTAGGGAGCAAGTC-3′), mPRE4 (5′-CACCACTTCCGGTACCTTAGGGAGCAAGTC-3′), mPRE5 (5′-CACCACTTCCGGGTTAACAGGGAGCAAGTC-3′), mPRE6 (5′-CACCACTTCCGGGTTCTTCTAGAGCAAGTC-3′), mCDE (5′-CGCGCGGTGGGATCCCTTAAACGCGA-3′), and mCHR (5′-GGTGTGCGCCCTGCAGCGCGACTCAA-3′). The expression vectors pCAGGS-E4TF1–60 and pCAGGS-E4TF1–53 were constructed as previously reported (33Kamura T. Handa H. Hamasaki N. Kitajima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11361-11368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells (5 × 106 per well of a 12-well plate) were transiently transfected with 1.0 μg of a luciferase construct and 0.25 μg of pSV-β galactosidase plasmid DNA (Promega) by using the Gene PORTER Transfection Reagent (Gene Therapy Systems), and at least three different batches of plasmid were tested per construct. Where indicated, 0.25 μg of pCAGGS-E4TF1–60 and/or 0.25 μg of pCAGGS-E4TF1–53 were co-transfected with pGL189. After a 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured by using the luciferase assay system (Promega). The resulting luciferase activity was corrected in light of the β-galactosidase activity of the cell extract (34Nielsen D.A. Chou J. MacKrell A.J. Casadaban M.J. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5198-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared by using a method previously reported (35Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and aliquots were frozen at −80 °C. EMSA was conducted according to a previously reported method (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) by using a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE buffer (22.5 mmTris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA). The probes were prepared by annealing the appropriate sense oligonucleotides with the antisense oligonucleotide. The binding reaction was performed at 20 °C for 30 min in 10 μl 1× binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 25 fmol of each probe end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, 2 μg of herring testis DNA, and 2 μg of each nuclear extract. For the competition assay, 20- or 200-fold excess amounts of the appropriate unlabeled probe were added to the binding reaction mixtures. Gel electrophoresis was carried out in a prerun at 200 V for 30 min and then at 200 V for 2 h 30 min. For the supershift assay, 1 μl of antibody against E4TF1–60 (Dr. Hiroshi Handa, Faculty of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan) or Ets-1 (Transduction Laboratories) was added to the reaction mixture. We confirmed the cell-cycle-regulated transcription of aurora A mRNA through Northern blot analysis by using synchronized cell populations. HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by double thymidine block followed by release. Laser-scanning cytometry confirmed that more than 60% of the cells were arrested in G1. After release from the thymidine block, about 50% of the cells immediately entered into the S phase. The cells were predominantly in the G2 phase at 8 h and entered G1 again at 12 h (Fig.1 B). Northern analysis of the cells (Fig. 1 A) showed that aurora A mRNA accumulated in late S phase (lane 2), peaked during G2/M (lanes 3 and 4), and decreased as the cells entered the G1 phase (lanes 5–7). Our results confirmed those of a previous investigation (7Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M. Slamon D.J. Plowman G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3052-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). We then amplified the 5′-flanking sequence of the aurora A gene by means of a standard PCR method. Primers were designed on the basis of the sequence of chromosome 20q13.2 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM accession number AL121914), on which the human aurora A gene is located (5Sen S. Zhou H. White R.A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2195-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 7Bischoff J.R. Anderson L. Zhu Y. Mossie K. Ng L. Souza B. Schryver B. Flanagan P. Clairvoyant F. Ginther C. Chan C.S. Novotny M. Slamon D.J. Plowman G.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3052-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). The resulting 1.8-kb fragment was cloned in pBluescript II SK(−) and sequenced. The sequence was identical to that of chromosome 20q13.2 except for 12 substituted bases. At least four pseudogenes were revealed by a BLAST homology search, and the aurora A gene comprised nine exons and nine introns (Fig. 2 A). One pseudogene, on chromosome 1, has an entire open reading frame in a single exon. Two pseudogenes were mapped to chromosome 10, both consisting of exon 6 and its downstream sequence. The last pseudogene is on chromosome 20 and also consists of exon 6 and its downstream sequence. We confirmed that the 5′-flanking sequence of theaurora A gene was indeed different from those of the pseudogenes (Fig. 2 B). These findings indicated that the cloned 1.8-kb fragment was the 5′-flanking region of the aurora A gene. Using HeLa and HEK293 cells as sources of total RNA, we next performed primer extension analysis to define the transcriptional initiation site of the aurora A gene and detected one major band (Fig. 3). We were unable to identify the putative TATA box around the transcriptional initiation region. Our results indicate that transcription of the aurora A gene is initiated from the site designated +1 in Fig. 2 B.Figure 3Determination of the transcription initiation site of the aurora A gene. The transcriptional initiation site was determined by primer extension using a γ-32P-labeled 21-base oligonucleotide primer. The labeled oligonucleotide was annealed to 8 μg of mRNA from HeLa and HEK293 cells. The sequence ladder (lanes G, A,T, and C) was obtained with the same primer.Solid triangle, transcription initiation site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To clarify the regions responsible for transcriptional regulation of aurora A, we transiently transfected HeLa and NIH3T3 cells with several luciferase constructs containing the progressively deleted 5′-flanking region of theaurora A gene and then measured the luciferase activity of the resulting cell extracts (Fig. 4). Luciferase activity was normalized in light of the activity of β-galactosidase; this gene was co-transfected into the HeLa and NIH3T3 cells. Extracts of both cell lines transfected with pGL1486 (containing the full-length 5′-flanking region) had high levels of luciferase activity. A deletion of the 5′-flanking sequence from −1486 to −124 did not affect the luciferase activity. An additional deletion to −90 resulted in about a 50% decrease of activity in HeLa cells, whereas it did not affect the activity in NIH3T3 cells. Further deletion to −75 resulted in about 90% decrease of activity in both HeLa and NIH3T3 cells. These results suggest that the transcription of the aurora A gene was positively regulated by a region (positive regulatory element; PRE) located between −90 and −75. A tissue-specific factor might regulate aurora A transcription through a cis-element located between −124 and −90. To characterize the positive regulatory element-binding proteins (PREBs), EMSA was performed with the nucleotide probe −90/−61, which corresponded to the sequence from −90 to −61 (Table I). We identified four PREBs (PREB-1, -2, -3, and -4) that bound to −90/−61 by using nuclear extracts from HeLa cells (Fig. 5,lane 2). The −90/−61-PREB1 was the major band; the other bands seemed to be minor. Formation of these complexes was inhibited by the addition of excess (20- and 200-fold) amounts of unlabeled probe (lanes 3 and 4). No specific protein binding was detected when we used a nucleotide probe from −124 to −91 (data not shown).Table IOligonucleotide probes used in EMSAsProbeSequenceRef.−90/−61CACCACTTCCGGGTTCTTAGGGAGCAAGTCM1––TGG–––––––––––––––––––––––––M2–––––TGG––––––––––––––––––––––M3–––––––––GAA––––––––––––––––––M4––––––––––––TAC–––––––––––––––M5–––––––––––––––AAC––––––––––––M6––––––––––––––––––CTA–––––––––NF-κ"
https://openalex.org/W2016277586,"Recently, a novel enzyme, 1-O-acylceramide synthase (ACS), was purified and characterized from bovine brain. This enzyme has both calcium-independent phospholipase A2 and transacylase activities. The discovery of this enzyme led us to propose a new pathway for ceramide metabolism in which the sn-2-acyl group of either phosphatidylethanolamine or phosphatidylcholine is transferred to the 1-hydroxyl group of ceramide. In this study, the partial amino acid sequences from the purified enzyme revealed that the enzyme contains amino acid sequences identical to those of human lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase-like lysophospholipase (LLPL). The coding sequences of the mouse, bovine, and human genes were obtained from the respective kidney cDNAs by PCR. The open reading frames of LLPL were cloned into pcDNA3 to generate carboxyl-terminally tagged proteins. The expression of mouse LLPL in COS-7 cells demonstrated that transfected cells had higher transacylase and phospholipase A2 activities than did non-transfected cells. Immunoprecipitation confirmed that LLPL had ACS activity. There were no significant lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase and lysophospholipase activities in the mouse LLPL-transfected cells under either acidic or neutral conditions. Amino acid sequences from cDNAs of mouse, human, and bovine LLPLs demonstrated a signal peptide cleavage site, one lipase motif (AXSXG), and several N-linked glycosylation sites in each LLPL molecule. The replacement of serine with alanine in the lipase motif of mouse LLPL resulted in elimination of enzyme activity, indicating that the serine residue is part of the catalytic site. Deglycosylation of mouse, human, and bovine LLPLs yielded core proteins with a molecular mass of 42 kDa without change in enzyme activities. LLPL was post-translationally modified by signal peptide cleavage and N-linked glycosylation, and each mature LLPL had the same size core protein. Subcellular fractionation demonstrated that ACS activity co-localized withN-acetylglucosaminidase. Therefore, LLPL encodes a novel lysosomal enzyme, ACS.

Deglycosylation of mouse, human, and bovine LLPLs yielded core proteins with a molecular mass of 42 kDa without change in enzyme activities. LLPL was post-translationally modified by signal peptide cleavage and N-linked glycosylation, and each mature LLPL had the same size core protein. Subcellular fractionation demonstrated that ACS activity co-localized withN-acetylglucosaminidase. Therefore, LLPL encodes a novel lysosomal enzyme, ACS. N-acetylsphingosine Madin-Darby canine kidney phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylcholine 1-O-acylceramide synthase lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase LCAT-like lysophospholipase hemagglutinin 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid polyvinylidene difluoride high performance thin-layer chromatography expressed sequence tag For the last decade, ceramide has been thought to play an important role in cell signal transduction involving cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, stress responses, and apoptosis (1Hannun Y.A. Luberto C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 73-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The ceramide levels within cells are regulated by several well defined metabolic pathways. We recently studied the metabolism ofN-acetylsphingosine (NAS)1 in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (2Abe A. Shayman J.A. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14383-14389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In that study, NAS was actively metabolized and was not an inert compound, as had been previously suggested (3Okazaki T. Bielawska A. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15823-15831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NAS was converted to other sphingolipids, including sphingosine, C2-sphingomyelin, C2-glucosylceramide, long-chain ceramide, long-chain sphingomyelin, and long-chain glucosylceramide. An unexpected product was also detected. This metabolite was a highly nonpolar compound and identified as 1-O-acyl-NAS.This discovery led to the discovery of a new enzyme activity, one that catalyzes the esterification of the hydroxyl group at C-1 in the ceramide molecule under acidic conditions. The enzyme does not require divalent cations for its activity. Glycerophospholipids (in particular, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC)) were identified as acyl group donors in the reaction. The acyl group at thesn-2-position in the phospholipid is transferred to an acceptor molecule, e.g. ceramide or water. If the acceptor is ceramide, 1-O-acylceramide is formed. However, if the acceptor is water, free fatty acid is released. It was also observed that a short-chain rather than a long-chain ceramide is preferred as an acceptor. These observations raised the possibility that this new enzyme regulates a novel pathway of ceramide metabolism.The new enzyme, named 1-O-acylceramide synthase (ACS), was purified from bovine brain and further characterized (4Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8467-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ACS is a water-soluble glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 45 kDa and a single polypeptide chain, which specifically binds to concanavalin A-conjugated agarose. The enzyme has a pH optimum at 4.5 and has both phospholipase A2 and transacylase activities. The enzyme activity is calcium-independent. Therefore, ACS may be classified as a calcium-independent phospholipase A2.In this study, we report that a BLAST search revealed that the peptides obtained from ACS purified from bovine brain share amino acid sequences with a recently reported human gene termed lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT)-like lysophospholipase (LLPL) (5Taniyama Y. Shibata S. Kita S. Horikoshi K. Fuse H. Shirafuji H. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To understand the biological function of ACS, the ACS gene was sequenced on the basis of its similarity to LLPL, and the gene products were characterized.DISCUSSIONThis cloning study revealed that the previously reported LLPL gene encodes ACS. The gene product expressed in LLPL-transfected cells has both transacylase and phospholipase A2 activities under acidic conditions, but lacks significant LCAT and lysophospholipase activities under either acidic or neutral conditions.Previously, Taniyama et al. (5Taniyama Y. Shibata S. Kita S. Horikoshi K. Fuse H. Shirafuji H. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that human LLPL expressed in COS-7 cells is a secreted protein that has lysophospholipase activity under neutral conditions. In this study, we failed to observe any significant increase in lysophospholipase activity in the cultured medium of COS-7 cells transfected with recombinant LLPL DNA. This was true even when lysophospholipase activity was assayed at concentrations exceeding the critical micellar concentration of lyso-PC. A very slight but significant increase in lysophospholipase activity in the soluble fraction of the LLPL-transfected cells was observed when assayed at lyso-PC concentrations greater than the critical micellar concentration. The specific activity of lysophospholipase was significantly lower than that of ACS. Purified ACS from bovine brain has weak enzyme activity as a phospholipase A1 (4Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8467-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, the lysophospholipase activity observed in recombinant LLPL probably reflects the minor phospholipase A1 activity of ACS. We conclude that the LLPL gene product mainly functions as ACS or as a phospholipase A2, but not as a lysophospholipase.Human recombinant LLPL is inactivated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate, indicating that the active site contains a serine residue (5Taniyama Y. Shibata S. Kita S. Horikoshi K. Fuse H. Shirafuji H. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In our study, the replacement of serine with alanine within the lipase motif (AXSXG) of recombinant LLPL resulted in a loss of the phospholipase A2 and transacylase activities. Therefore, the serine residue in the lipase motif must be essential for enzyme activity. As reported for human LLPL (5Taniyama Y. Shibata S. Kita S. Horikoshi K. Fuse H. Shirafuji H. Sumino Y. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 14Jonas A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), the catalytic triad of serine 181, aspartic acid 345, and histidine 377 of LCAT is also conserved in mouse and bovine LLPLs (Fig. 1). This observation is consistent with the view that the serine residue in the motif is an active site and that the enzyme forms an acyl-enzyme intermediate via the hydroxyl group of the serine (Fig.10).The deduced amino acid sequences of mouse, human, and bovine LLPLs indicate that each entire sequence has a signal sequence cleavage site and N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1). Based on the presence of the cleavage site, the processed LLPL would be predicted to consist of 379 amino acid residues, corresponding to a molecular mass of 43 kDa. This value is in agreement with the observed results following treatment of each recombinant LLPL with endoglycosidase F1. Based on amino-terminal sequence analysis of bovine brain LLPL, bovine LLPL is presumed to consist of 378 amino acid residues. These data support the interpretation that the precursor protein of LLPL is post-translationally modified by both signal peptide cleavage and N-linked glycosylation.The observations that ACS has an acidic pH optimum andN-linked oligomannose and co-localizes with β-hexosaminidase in MDCK cells strongly indicate that ACS is a lysosomal enzyme. Deglycosylation of recombinant LLPLs had no effect on ACS activity. Thus, the oligomannose in ACS is probably involved in sorting ACS to lysosome.The family of phospholipase A2 enzymes has expanded greatly in recent years (15Six D.A. Dennis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1488: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). With this expansion, the criteria for recognition of an enzyme as a phospholipase A2 and its assignment to one of the 11 currently recognized groups have become more stringent. Currently, there are no lysosomal phospholipases A2 that meet such criteria. In 1997, a calcium-independent phospholipase A2 activity that was inhibited by serine hydrolase inhibitors was described (16Kim T.S. Sundaresh C.S. Feinstein S.I. Dodia C. Skach W.R. Jain M.K. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2542-2550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This enzyme was subsequently identified as a 1-cysteine peroxiredoxin (17Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar); and thus, its characterization as a phospholipase A2 has been challenged.We conclude that the product of the gene encoding LLPL is not a lysophospholipase, but ACS. Moreover, ACS is identified as a lysosomal enzyme and has the dual enzyme activities of a calcium-independent transacylase and phospholipase A2. A reaction mechanism for ACS is proposed (Fig. 10). In this model, the enzyme reacts with phospholipid and forms an acyl-enzyme intermediate at serine 165 of the mature protein based on the putative cleavage site. The acyl group of the intermediate is then transferred to a hydroxyl group of water or lipophilic alcohol such as ceramide.We believe that ACS is a lysosomal phospholipase A2, but its biological function is unknown. Several possible functions may be entertained, but remain to be tested. ACS may play a primary role in regulating the levels of ceramide within cells. Many investigators have postulated that ceramide may mediate cell differentiation and death responses. A means for regulating ceramide content, particularly through lysosome-mediated pathways, may be important in such a system. In this regard, ACS may function to terminate the biological activities of ceramide generated through signaling pathways perhaps by sequestering ceramide within lysosomes or by facilitating its movement across membrane leaflets. Alternatively, ACS produces a novel metabolite, 1-O-acylceramide. We have previously observed that phospholipids containing arachidonate can serve as the acyl donor for the transacylase reaction (2Abe A. Shayman J.A. Radin N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14383-14389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether 1-O-arachidonylceramide is a source for biologically active arachidonic acid in cells. Finally, it is also conceivable that water is the usual acceptor for ACS and that its primary function is to serve as a lysosomal phospholipase A2 with PE and PC as preferred substrates and their respective lysolipids and free fatty acids as products.Based on the characterization reported in this study, the nomenclature used to refer to this lysosomal phospholipase is inaccurate. LCAT-like lysophospholipase does not describe the primary activity of this protein and should probably be discarded. Similarly, 1-O-acylceramide synthase may not reflect the primary lipid pathway catalyzed by the phospholipase because its in vivoactivity has yet to be established. We propose therefore that the name lysosomal phospholipase A2 be used in reference to this enzyme. For the last decade, ceramide has been thought to play an important role in cell signal transduction involving cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, stress responses, and apoptosis (1Hannun Y.A.

https://openalex.org/W2075905225,"Prostate cancer metastasis to bone marrow involves initial adhesion of tumor cells to the bone marrow endothelium, followed by transmigration and proliferation within the marrow. Rapid, specific adhesion of highly metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma cells (PC3M-LN4) to bone marrow endothelial cell (BMEC) lines requires a pericellular hyaluronan (HA) matrix and correlates with dramatically up-regulated HA synthase (HAS) expression. Non-metastatic prostate tumor cells (LNCaP) do not assemble a HA matrix, adhere poorly to BMECs, and express normal levels of HAS. Preferential bone metastasis of prostate carcinoma cells may therefore be facilitated by tumor cell HA biosynthesis. In this report, HAS gene expression was manipulated to investigate the direct impact of prostate tumor cell HA production on adhesion to BMECs. PC3M-LN4 cells stably transfected with antisense HAS2 and HAS3 failed to form pericellular matrices. Adhesion of these transfectants to BMECs was significantly diminished, comparable to the low level exhibited by LNCaP cells. Upon transfection with full-length HAS2 or HAS3, the non-adherent LNCaP cells retained pericellular HA and adhered to BMECs. The results of this study are consistent with a model in which HA matrix formation, BMEC adhesion, and metastatic potential are mediated by HAS expression. Prostate cancer metastasis to bone marrow involves initial adhesion of tumor cells to the bone marrow endothelium, followed by transmigration and proliferation within the marrow. Rapid, specific adhesion of highly metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma cells (PC3M-LN4) to bone marrow endothelial cell (BMEC) lines requires a pericellular hyaluronan (HA) matrix and correlates with dramatically up-regulated HA synthase (HAS) expression. Non-metastatic prostate tumor cells (LNCaP) do not assemble a HA matrix, adhere poorly to BMECs, and express normal levels of HAS. Preferential bone metastasis of prostate carcinoma cells may therefore be facilitated by tumor cell HA biosynthesis.

The preferential homing of circulating prostate tumor cells to bone marrow is thought to involve an initial rapid adhesion to cells of the bone marrow endothelium, followed by transmigration of the endothelium, engagement of specific receptors, and subsequent proliferation within the bone marrow microenvironment. Molecular mechanisms underlying these processes are poorly understood, but there is evidence that tumor cells may exploit existing pathways utilized by circulating blood cell progenitors to gain access to bone marrow. To identify potential cell adhesion molecules involved in prostate tumor bone metastasis, research in our laboratory has focused on the interaction of prostate carcinoma cells with bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs).1 Highly metastatic PC3M-LN4 cells (1Pettaway C.A. Pathak S. Greene G. Ramirez E. Wilson M.R. Killion J.J. Fidler I.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1627-1636PubMed Google Scholar) were found to adhere rapidly to human bone marrow-derived sinusoidal endothelial cell lines, whereas poorly metastatic LNCaP cells were only weakly adherent (2Simpson M.A. Reiland J.

This adhesion, specific for BMECs relative to other endothelial cells, was subsequently found to depend upon the presence of a pericellular hyaluronan (HA) matrix assembled on the PC3M-LN4 cells. The presence of pericellular HA further correlated with elevated HA synthesis and expression of HA biosynthetic enzymes in the metastatic cells. Collectively, our results may implicate tumor cell-associated HA and up-regulation of HA synthase (HAS) in prostate cancer progression, possibly by facilitating arrest in the bone microvasculature and/or preferential tissue colonization of individual tumor cells. HA is a ubiquitous polysaccharide component of extracellular and cell-associated matrices (3Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.

Formby B. Stern R. Development. 1997; 124: 3987-3997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some cell types, this requirement entails assembly of a pericellular HA matrix (8Knudson C.B. Toole B.P. Dev.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Cell-associated HA is thought to stimulate cellular detachment during proliferation and migration, and HA deposition is associated with normal and transformed cell growth and migration in several species (10Koochekpour S. Pilkington G.J. Merzak A. Int. J Cancer. 1995; 63: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of HA in urine and serum often correlate with advanced cancer (11Delpech B.

Pathol. 1987; 40: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Production of HA is thought to be directly involved in prostate cancer progression. In human cancerous prostates, HA levels are increased on the carcinoma cells and correspond to dedifferentiation of the cancer (13De Klerk D.P. Prostate. 1983; 4: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14De Klerk D.P. Lee D.V. Human H.J. J. Urol. 1984; 131: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HA biosynthesis is catalyzed by transmembrane HAS enzymes (15Weigel P.H. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13997-14000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Three human isoforms have been identified and cloned (HAS1(16Shyjan A.M. Heldin P. Butcher E.C. Yoshino T. Briskin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23395-23399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), HAS2 (17Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22945-22948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and HAS3 (18Spicer A.P. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1923-1932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar)). The cDNA of each isoform is capable of conferring HA synthesis and pericellular HA retention to transfected cells. HAS expression is ubiquitous, but isoforms exhibit temporal and tissue-specific distribution. HAS2, for example, is essential for mouse pericardial endothelial cell migration and transformation to mesenchyme during cardiac development (19Camenisch T.D. Spicer A.P. Brehm-Gibson T. Biesterfeldt J. Augustine M.L. Calabro Jr., A. Kubalak S. Klewer S.E. McDonald J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). HAS2 is also specifically up-regulated in response to wounding in a mesothelial cell model (20Yung S. Thomas G.J. Davies M. Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 1953-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of HAS2 in fibrosarcoma cells or HAS3 in prostate carcinoma cells yields significantly larger subcutaneous tumors in nude mice (21Kosaki R. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1141-1145PubMed Google Scholar, 22Liu N. Gao F. Han Z. Xu X. Underhill C.B. Zhang L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5207-5214PubMed Google Scholar). Mammary carcinoma cells transfected with HAS1 are more metastatic than control cells (23Itano N. Sawai T. Miyaishi O. Kimata K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2499-2504PubMed Google Scholar). In a melanoma model, tumor cells selected for abundant cell-surface HA were highly tumorigenic and metastatic, whereas tumor cells bearing little or no surface HA, although equally tumorigenic, did not metastasize (6Zhang L. Underhill C.B. Chen L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 428-433PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter model, however, HAS isoform expression was not characterized. Collectively, these results suggest involvement of HA in tumor growth and metastasis and imply that specific HAS isoforms and/or expression levels of those isoforms may mediate these processes. Expression of HAS appears to correlate directly with HA synthesis (24Jacobson A. Brinck J. Briskin M.J. Spicer A.P. Heldin P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), suggesting that elevated HA in tumor cells is probably a reflection of HAS gene expression. In our previous report, we determined that HAS2 and HAS3, normally present at low levels in the prostate, are strongly up-regulated in metastatic prostate tumor cells (2Simpson M.A. Reiland J. Burger S.R. Furcht L.T. Spicer A.P. Oegema Jr., T.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17949-17957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In this report, we have used thein vitro BMEC adhesion model to examine the role of these enzymes and their product in prostate cancer bone metastasis. Specifically, we have manipulated expression of HAS2 and HAS3 in tumor cell lines and evaluated them for HA synthesis, pericellular HA retention, and HA-dependent adhesion to BMECs. Individual inhibition of HAS2 or HAS3 expression in metastatic PC3M-LN4 cells was found to diminish pericellular HA retention and BMEC adhesion; however, complete inhibition of HA-mediated adhesion was obtained by double antisense expression. Conversely, we found that overexpression of either HAS2 or HAS3 in non-metastatic LNCaP cells conferred pericellular HA retention and HA-mediated adhesion to BMECs. These results definitively implicate HAS expression in rapid adhesion of prostate carcinoma cells to BMECs, which may thereby impact the bone metastatic potential of circulating tumor cells. LNCaP human prostate adenocarcinoma cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The PC3 derivative cell line PC3M-LN4 (also a human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line) was kindly provided by Dr. Isaiah J. Fidler (M. D. Anderson Hospital Cancer Center, Houston, TX) and was maintained in MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate, and nonessential amino acids. Prostate carcinoma cells were plated 2 days prior to experiments and used at ∼70% confluence. Transformed human BMECs (TrHBMECs) were a gift from Dr. Karin Schweitzer (Free University Hospital Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (25Schweitzer K.M. Vicart P. Delouis C. Paulin D. Drager A.M. Langenhuijsen M.M. Weksler B.B. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 25-36PubMed Google Scholar). Aggrecan was prepared as previously described (26Knudson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) from Swarm rat chondrosarcoma. Full-length human HAS3 cDNA was subcloned by PCR using oligonucleotides that incorporated flankingSacI and EcoRI restriction sites. HAS2 cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR from PC3M-LN4 mRNA using oligonucleotides that incorporated NheI and BamHI restriction sites. Full-length cDNAs were inserted in pIRES2-EGFP (CLONTECH) via the NheI/BamHI (HAS2) or SacI/EcoRI (HAS3) restriction sites. The sequences were verified and found to be identical to the published sequence. For antisense constructs, HAS2 or HAS3 plasmid DNA was used as the template to amplify the first 300 bases of each isoform sequence, including the ATG start codon, which was then subcloned in the antisense orientation into pIRES-Hyg (CLONTECH). For double antisense HAS inhibition, we expressed antisense HAS2 as a bicistronic message with GFP (pIRES2-EGFP vector) and antisense HAS3 with hygromycin resistance (pIRES-Hyg). LNCaP cells were transfected with Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium according to the manufacturer's protocol and allowed to recover in complete standard culture medium for 24–48 h before assaying. GFP expression was verified in LNCaP cells by flow cytometry, and expression of HAS2 and HAS3 RNAs was ascertained by RT-PCR as described below. PC3M-LN4 cells were incubated for 30 min in serum-free minimal essential medium containing 0.5 units/ml chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) to remove inhibitory glycosaminoglycans and subsequently transfected with FuGENE 6 liposome-mediated transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PC3M-LN4 cells were cotransfected with pIRES2-EGFP and pIRES-Hyg for the vector-transfected control, termed GFP. Individual antisense HAS2 or HAS3 transfectants were created by cotransfection of pIRES2-EGFP and HAS2-Hyg or HAS3-Hyg, respectively. Double antisense HAS transfectants received HAS2-GFP and HAS3-Hyg. All transfectants were selected through multiple rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and antibiotic selection in 1 mg/ml G418 and 0.8 mg/ml hygromycin until the final cell populations were 85–95% positive for GFP expression. Once established, stable transfectants were maintained in the parental medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 and 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin. HAS isoform and relative level of expression in prostate carcinoma cell lines was semiquantitatively assayed by RT-PCR as previously described (2Simpson M.A. Reiland J. Burger S.R. Furcht L.T. Spicer A.P. Oegema Jr., T.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17949-17957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from subconfluent LNCaP and PC3M-LN4 transfectants with the Oligotex mRNA isolation kit (QIAGEN Inc.) and quantitated by Ribogreen fluorescence (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). 20 ng of each mRNA template was reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dT) primer using the Sensiscript kit (QIAGEN Inc.). PCR oligonucleotides specific for HAS2 and HAS3 messages were designed from the sequence data base; expected product sizes are 980 base pairs for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) message, 210 base pairs for HAS2 message, and 410 base pairs for HAS3 message. GAPDH was amplified with each reaction to standardize conditions using oligonucleotides available from Invitrogen. Cycling conditions for HAS2 and HAS3 amplification from PC3M-LN4 cells were optimized independently as follows: 1-min initial denaturation at 95 °C; 33 cycles (HAS2) or 25 cycles (HAS3) of 30-s denaturation, 30-s annealing at 60 °C, and 30-s polymerization at 72 °C; and 5-min final extension at 72 °C. For cDNA amplification from LNCaP transient transfectant mRNA, 30 cycles of the above conditions were uniformly employed. A 15-μl aliquot of each reaction was electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and digitally photographed. LNCaP transfectants were analyzed in suspension for the retention of cell-surface HA. 2 days post-transfection, cells were released with PBS containing 3 mm EDTA, washed with FACS buffer (PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2), passed twice through a mesh cell filter to remove aggregates, and resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml in FACS buffer with or without 16 units/ml Streptomyceshyaluronidase (HAase) (Calbiochem). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then washed and resuspended in FACS buffer containing biotinylated HA-binding protein (HABP) (Seikagaku America, Inc.) at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Following a 90-min room temperature incubation with agitation, cells were washed with FACS buffer, resuspended in streptavidin-conjugated perCP (PharMingen) at a final dilution of 1:200, and incubated for an additional 1 h under the same conditions. After a final wash in FACS buffer, cells were resuspended in 0.3 ml of FACS buffer and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Results were gated to include only GFP-fluorescing cells and plotted as a histogram for HABP positivity. The concentration of HA in transfected cell culture supernatants was determined in a competitive binding assay (27Lokeshwar V.B. Obek C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 773-777PubMed Google Scholar). Immulon 96-well microtiter plates were coated with human umbilical cord HA at 50 μg/ml in 200 mm carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) overnight at 4 °C. Excess HA was removed, and wells were blocked with four washes of Pierce Superblock reagent. Prostate carcinoma cells (30,000 cells/well) were plated overnight in 24-well plates. Cells were washed, given fresh media, and incubated for an additional 20–24 h. Overnight conditioned culture media were harvested, and cell counts were determined by trypsin release and manual counting in a hemocytometer. Cell culture supernatants were centrifuged to remove cellular material or particulates, boiled for 20 min to inactivate protein components, and serially diluted in PBS and 0.05% Tween 20. Equal volumes of each dilution were combined with biotinylated HABP (Seikagaku America, Inc.) to a final HABP concentration of 1 μg/ml and incubated in the HA-precoated wells at room temperature for 6–8 h. The plate was washed four times with PBS and Tween 20 and developed using an avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase system (Vector Laboratories ABC-HRP PK-4000 kit) with tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) as substrate, and absorbance was read at 650 nm. HA concentration was interpolated from a standard curve of absorbance values corresponding to known HA quantities. The mean HA concentration for each sample of culture supernatant was calculated, and results were normalized to cell number. Data are presented as mass of HA (in micrograms)/106 cells. Subconfluent prostate carcinoma cells were PBS/EDTA-released, washed with adhesion medium (RPMI 1640 medium with 0.1% BSA and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), maintained throughout the assay at 37 °C), and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in adhesion medium. Cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml calcein/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.; a compound that is converted to a fluorophore only upon uptake and metabolism by living cells) for 20 min, washed with adhesion medium, and resuspended at 1 × 105 cells/ml. TrHBMECs were seeded 100% confluent (∼40,000 cells/well) in 48-well plates overnight and washed twice with adhesion medium prior to the assay. Prostate carcinoma cells (300 μl/well) were added to the confluent endothelial cell monolayers and incubated for 12 min at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. Non-adherent cells were removed with two washes done by gently pipetting 2 × 0.5 ml of adhesion medium and immediately decanting. Viability of non-adherent cells was verified by trypan blue exclusion. Adherent cells were solubilized with PBS containing 0.2n NaOH and 1% SDS and quantified in a Cytofluor II fluorescence plate reader at 485/530 nm (Biosearch Inc., Bedford, MA). Calcein/AM-labeled prostate carcinoma cell suspensions (5 × 105 cells/ml) were preincubated with 16 units/ml Streptomyces HAase for 25 min and diluted to 1 × 105 cells/ml with adhesion medium prior to the assay. HAase was present throughout the assay. Pericellular HA matrices were visualized as described (8Knudson C.B. Toole B.P. Dev. Biol. 1985; 112: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, prostate carcinoma cells cultured overnight in 48-well plates were washed and treated for 25 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of Streptomyces HAase (16 units/ml in phenol red-free MEM with 0.1% BSA). This medium was removed, and cells were incubated for 90 min with 2 mg/ml aggrecan in MEM and 0.1% BSA at 37 °C. The aggrecan solution was removed, and 1 × 108 glutaraldehyde-fixed sheep red blood cells (Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp.) in PBS and 1% BSA were added, allowed to settle for 15 min, and then viewed by phase-contrast microscopy. The HA matrix was evidenced by halos surrounding the cells from which the fixed erythrocytes were excluded. Representative cells were photographed at a magnification of ×400. To quantify matrix retention, outlines of matrices and cellular boundaries from 10–15 individual cells of each type were traced, and relative areas were calculated using NIH Image software. HA matrix thickness is presented as the ratio of matrix area to cell area for each transfectant or condition. Values for individual cell tracings were plotted, with mean values represented in each distribution by a horizontal bar. A ratio of 1 indicates complete absence of pericellular clearing. In our previous work (2Simpson M.A. Reiland J. Burger S.R. Furcht L.T. Spicer A.P. Oegema Jr., T.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17949-17957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we correlated overexpression of mRNA for HAS2 and HAS3 with aggressive prostate carcinoma cell lines. We reasoned that altered HA synthesis and/or pericellular HA matrix assembly by prostate carcinoma cells could contribute to tumorigenic or metastatic behavior, either by overall HAS expression level or in an isoform-specific fashion. To establish a functional correlation, we decided to overexpress full-length cDNA for HAS2 or HAS3 in LNCaP cells, which synthesize little or no HA, and to inhibit HAS2 or HAS3 expression in PC3M-LN4 cells, which have a thick pericellular HA matrix. We chose the pIRES2-EGFP eukaryotic expression vector, which expresses inserted cDNA as a bicistronic message with GFP, so cells expressing GFP can be separated from untransfected cells by flow cytometry. Expression of GFP therefore requires the transcription of HAS message and provides a useful detection mechanism for transfected cells expressing high levels of that message. This is particularly critical for antisense RNA expression, where it is frequently difficult to verify the presence of antisense message. The vector also provides an antibiotic resistance gene for stable selection. LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with vector alone (GFP) or with vector containing cDNA encoding full-length human HAS2 or HAS3. Transfection efficiencies in the population as measured by flow cytometric analysis of GFP expression were consistently 7–10% for HAS2 cDNA and 15–20% for HAS3 cDNA. Expression of HAS mRNA in the transfected cells was verified by RT-PCR (Fig.1). Consistent with our previous characterization of the LNCaP cell line (2Simpson M.A. Reiland J. Burger S.R. Furcht L.T. Spicer A.P. Oegema Jr., T.R. McCarthy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17949-17957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), GFP control transfectants did not yield detectable amounts of HAS2 product and only small quantities of HAS3 (lanes 4 and 9, respectively). Easily amplified HAS2 and HAS3 products were found only in the respective transfected cell types: lanes 5 and 10in Fig. 1 correspond to HAS2 transfectants, and lanes 6 and11 are HAS3 transfectants. Simultaneous control amplification of the GAPDH housekeeping gene from each transfectant is provided in lanes 1–3, and HAS2 (lanes 7 and8) and HAS3 (lanes 12 and 13) plasmid constructs were amplified as positive controls for specificity of the reactions. To evaluate functionality of the expressed HAS2 and HAS3 proteins, HA synthesis was measured. It has been shown previously that the majority of HA synthesized by cells in culture is secreted to the culture medium (17Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22945-22948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We analyzed HA secretion by LNCaP transient transfectants in a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” LNCaP GFP transfectant culture supernatants were found to contain ≈0.5 μg of HA/106cells (Fig. 2), in close agreement with levels detected in untransfected LNCaP cultures. Following transfection with HAS2 and HAS3 constructs, culture media contained nearly 3- and 4-fold increased HA levels, respectively, confirming enzymatic activity of the transfected cDNA products. Remarkably, the quantity of HA detected in HAS-transfected supernatants was greater by 1–1.5 μg/106 cells than in controls. Normalized to the 10–15% transfection efficiency of the cells, this HA increase corresponds to a synthesis rate of ≈10–15 μg/106 transfected cells, which is on the order of catalysis measured for the PC3M-LN4 cell line (see Fig. 7).Figure 7Inhibition of HAS2 and/or HAS3 expression in PC3M-LN4 cells by stable antisense transfection reduces HA synthesis and secretion. PC3M-LN4 cells were selected as described under “Experimental Procedures” for stable expression of control vectors alone (GFP) or vectors encoding antisense HAS2 RNA (H2as), antisense HAS3 RNA (H2as), or double antisense HAS2/HAS3 RNA (H2/3as). Transfectants were seeded in triplicate wells of a 24-well plate (30,000 cells/well). Seeding media were removed the following day; cells were washed; and fresh medium was applied. These overnight conditioned media were then harvested and analyzed for HA content by competitive binding assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HA quantity was normalized to cell number as determined by trypsin release and manual counting in a hemocytometer. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. of three independent HA quantitations performed on triplicate culture supernatants for each transfectant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess potential cell-surface HA retention resulting from enhanced HA production, we used particle exclusion. In this assay, cells were preincubated with a specific HA-binding proteoglycan (aggrecan), and small red blood cells were allowed to settle around the much larger prostate cells. Those cells with surface-associated HA exhibited surrounding clear zones. Both the HAS2- and HAS3-transfected LNCaP cells were clearly observed to have a halo (Fig.3, B and C, respectively), whereas the GFP control (Fig. 3 A) lacked such a pericellular zone of exclusion, indicating that transfection of LNCaP cells with HAS2 or HAS3 also conferred surface HA retention. Cells did not appear to exhibit any isoform specificity with regard to the thickness of the matrix as measured in this assay. However, there was a definite correlation between intensity of GFP fluorescence (indicative of transfected cells) and matrix size (data not shown). To verify the HA content of the matrices produced by HAS-transfected cells, transfectants were digested with HAase prior to addition of aggrecan, upon which the pericellular clear zones were no longer visible (Fig. 3,D–F). To verify retention of cell-associated HA in suspended cells, we performed a two-color FACS analysis. Single cell suspensions of LNCaP cells transiently transfected with GFP control, HAS2, or HAS3 constructs were incubated with a biotinylated HABP probe, detected with a streptavidin-conjugated fluorophore, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were gated to include only GFP-positive transfectants and plotted to illustrate HA binding (Fig. 4,solid line). HAase sensitivity of the HABP probe demonstrated the specificity of its reactivity with HA and affirmed the HA content of the matrix retained by LNCaP HAS2 and HAS3 transfectants in suspension (dotted line). Using this assay, it was apparent that although both HAS transfectants possessed surface HA, LNCaP HAS3 transfectants (Fig. 4 B), relative to HAS2-transfected cells (Fig. 4 A), retained considerably more matrix with HABP-binding potential composed of HAase-sensitive material. Gating on very high GFP-expressing cells, which would be assumed to represent the highest HAS-expressing population, increased the amount of HABP signal intensity in HAS2 transfectants, but not to the level of HAS3 transfectants (data not shown). Reduced apparent transfection efficiency of HAS2 rendered it difficult to obtain significant numbers of highly GFP-positive cells to analyze, however; so this difference may reflect greater transfected message instability rather than inherent isoform-specific matrix formation. To determine whether surface HA retention could mediate adhesion to BMECs, LNCaP HAS2 and HAS3 transfectants and corresponding GFP controls were labeled and applied to confluent TrHBMEC monolayers. Like the parental LNCaP cells, ad"
https://openalex.org/W2061516091,"The incidence of neurological disabilities ascribable to perinatal injury is rising in Western countries, raising ethical and financial problems. No curative treatments are available. The pathophysiology of brain lesions of hypoxic-ischemic or inflammatory origin involves various neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. Among these, glutamate plays a key role. By overactivating N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, it triggers the excitotoxic cascade. Although addictive, nicotine prevents excitotoxic neuronal death in adult animals. Its potential neuroprotective effects have not been evaluated in neonates. We found that nicotine is neuroprotective in vivo, in a murine model of neonatal excitotoxic brain injury, and in vitro, in primary cultures of cortical neurons. We investigated the respective roles in nicotine-related neuroprotection of the two dominant nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) isoforms, namely, alpha4beta2 (heteropentameric) and alpha7 (homopentameric). Inhibition of alpha4beta2, either pharmacological (i.e., an alpha4beta2 nAChR antagonist) or molecular (beta2-/- knockout mice), abolished the protective effect of nicotine in vivo and in vitro, suggesting the involvement of alpha4beta2 nAChR in neonatal nicotine-related neuroprotection. In contrast, activation of alpha7 nAChR, which is protective in adult animals, was deleterious in our neonatal model, whereas its blockade, either pharmacological or molecular (alpha7-/- knockout mice) provided neuroprotection. Neuroprotective strategies must consider these opposite properties of distinct nAChR isoforms in neonates."
https://openalex.org/W2120254637,"The principal regulator of p53 stability is HDM2, an E3 ligase that mediates p53 degradation via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway. The current model holds that p53 degradation occurs exclusively on cytoplasmic proteasomes and hence has an absolute requirement for nuclear export of p53 via the CRM-1 pathway. However, proteasomes are abundant in both cytosol and nucleus, and no studies have been done to determine under what physiological circumstances p53 degradation might occur in the nucleus. We analyzed HDM2-mediated degradation of endogenous p53 in the presence of various nuclear export inhibitors of CRM-1, including leptomycin B (LMB), a noncompetitive, specific, and fast-acting inhibitor; and HTLV1-Rex protein, a potent competitive inhibitor. We found that significant HDM2-mediated p53 degradation took place in the presence of LMB or HTLV1-Rex, indicating that endogenous p53 degradation occurs locally in the nucleus, in parallel to cytoplasmic degradation. Moreover, p53 null cells that coexpressed export-defective mutants of p53 and HDM2 retained partial competence for p53 degradation. It is important that nuclear degradation of p53 occurred during the poststress recovery phase of a p53 response, after DNA damage ceased. We propose that the capability of local p53 degradation within the nucleus provides a tighter and faster control during the down-regulatory phase, when an active p53 program needs to be turned off quickly."
https://openalex.org/W2040201685,"Recent experimental findings involve corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the cellular response to noxious stimuli and possibly apoptosis. The aim of the present work was to examine the effect of CRH on apoptosis and the Fas/Fas ligand system in an <i>in vitro</i> model, the PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cell line, which is widely used in the study of apoptosis and at the same time expresses the CRH/CRH receptor system. We have found the following. CRH induced Fas ligand production and apoptosis. These effects were mediated by the CRH type 1 receptor because its antagonist antalarmin blocked CRH-induced apoptosis and Fas ligand expression. CRH activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which was found to be essential for CRH-induced apoptosis and Fas ligand production. CRH also promoted a rapid and transient activation of ERK1/2, which, however, was not necessary for either CRH-induced apoptosis or Fas ligand production. Thus, CRH promotes PC12 apoptosis via the CRH type 1 receptor, which induces Fas ligand production via activation of p38."
https://openalex.org/W2110606946,"Pax6 is a transcription factor that regulates the development of the visual, olfactory, and central nervous systems, pituitary, and pancreas. Pax6 is required for induction, growth, and maintenance of the lens; however, few direct Pax6 target genes are known. This study was designed to identify batteries of differentially expressed genes in three related systems: 8-week old Pax6 heterozygous lenses, 8-week old Pax6 heterozygous eyes, and transgenic lenses overexpressing PAX6(5a), using high throughput cDNA microarrays containing about 9700 genes. Initially, we obtained almost 400 differentially expressed genes in lenses from mice heterozygous for a Pax6 deletion, suggesting that Pax6 haploinsufficiency causes global changes in the lens transcriptome. Comparisons between the three sets of analyses revealed that paralemmin, molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase, Tel6 oncogene (ETV6), a cleavage-specific factor (Cpsf1) and tangerin A were abnormally expressed in all three experimental models. Semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis confirmed that all five of these genes were differentially expressed in Pax-6 heterozygous and Pax6(5a) transgenic lenses. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that paralemmin is found at high levels in the adult lens and confirmed its down-regulation in the Pax6(5a)-transgenic lenses. Collectively, our data provide insights into the genetic programs regulated by Pax6 in the lens.

Collectively, our data provide insights into the genetic programs regulated by Pax6 in the lens. Pax6 is among the most widely studied transcription factors because of its participation in the organogenesis of the eye, brain, head, and pancreas (1.Glaser T. Walton D.S. Cai J. Epstein J.A.

The essential role of Pax6 in early eye induction is conserved throughout the evolution of multicellular animals with ectopic expression able to direct conversion of wing imaginal disks to eyes in Drosophila melanogaster (2.Callaerts P.

In the vertebrate eye, Pax6 is required for lens placode formation, growth of the lens (6.Van Raamsdonk C.D. Tilghman S.M. Development. 2000; 127: 5439-5448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), correct placement of a single retina in the eye (7.Ashery-Padan R. Marquardt T. Zhou X Gruss P.

The diverse functions of Pax6 appear to originate from both the complex regulatory mechanisms controlling the tissue-specific transcription and splicing of the Pax6 mRNA as well as its ability to participate in multiple molecular interactions. A prevailing form of Pax6 in mouse embryos contains two DNA-binding domains, the paired domain and homeodomain (HD), 1The abbreviations used are: HDhomeodomainRTreverse transcriptionESTexpressed sequence tagMOCS3molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase 1The abbreviations used are: HDhomeodomainRTreverse transcriptionESTexpressed sequence tagMOCS3molybdopterin synthase sulfurylase which can interact both independently and cooperatively with DNA, whereas the C terminus comprises the transcriptional activation domain (9.Jun S.

Development. 1996; 122: 2639-2650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A splice variant, Pax6(5a), has an additional 14 amino acids inserted into the PAI subdomain. This results in its recognition of only a subset of Pax6 binding sites (11.Epstein J.A. Glaser T. Cai L. Jepeal L Maas R.L.

Recent evidence suggests that Pax6 function is further modulated by interactions of its homeodomain with a diverse set of proteins, including the homeodomain-containing proteins Six3, Prox1, and Lhx2 (15.Mikkola I.

Genetic evidence suggests that the genes for the eye development regulators Eya1 and -2 (22.Xu P.X. Woo I. Her H. Beier D.R. Maas R.L.

In addition to these developmental regulators, Pax6 can directly regulate the insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin genes expressed in the pancreas (22.Xu P.X. Woo I. Her H. Beier D.R. Maas R.L.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the lens. Our studies demonstrate the usefulness of microarray analysis for the analysis of gene expression in pathological conditions and give some insight into the function of Pax6 in the mature lens. NMRI mice heterozygous for a Pax6 knockout/lacZ knock-in allele were generously provided by Dr. Peter Gruss (Max-Planck-Institute of Biophysical Chemistry, Gottingen, Germany) (34.St-Onge L. Sosa-Peneda B. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar), while wild type NMRI mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (L'Arbresle, France). FVB/N mice overexpressing Pax6(5a) in lens fiber cells under the control of the mouse αA-crystallin promoter and wild type strain matched controls were described previously (14.Duncan M.K. Kozmik Z. Cveklova K. Piatigorsky J. Cvekl A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lenses and eyes from which lenses were surgically removed were isolated from 8-week-old Pax6 heterozygous and wild type mice and stored in RNAlater (Ambion, Woodlands, TX) until RNA isolations were performed using the Totally RNA kit (Ambion). The genotype of Pax6 heterozygous lenses was confirmed by assaying the expression of Pax6 and lac Z using RT-PCR using primers designed to amplify Pax6 (5′-TTT AAC CAA GGG CGG TGA GCA G-3′ and 5′-TCT CGG ATT TCC CAA GCA AAG ATG-3′) and lacZ mRNAs (5′-GTC AGG TCA TGG ATG AGC AG-3′ and 5′-CAC TAC GCG TAC TGT GAG C-3′) employing the One Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). The initial RT step was conducted at 50 °C for 30 min, and amplifications were conducted at the annealing temperature of 58 °C. Lenses were isolated from 3- and 8-week mice overexpressing PAX6(5a) in lens fiber cells and strain-matched controls as described (14.Duncan M.K. Kozmik Z. Cveklova K. Piatigorsky J. Cvekl A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and RNA was immediately prepared using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison, WI). cDNAs were generated using 2–5 μg of total RNA and indirectly labeled with Cy3- and Cy5-specific dendrimers, employing the 3DNA detection system from Genisphere, Inc. (Montvale, NJ) (35.Stears R.L. Getts R.C. Gullans S.R. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 3: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Glass slide microarrays containing about 9700 mouse sequence verified genes were described elsewhere (36.Cheung V.G. Morley M. Aguilar F. Massimi A. Kucherlapati R. Childs G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21S: 15-19Crossref Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The hybridizations were performed at 50 °C, with three subsequent washes of the slides performed in 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS; 2× SSC; and 0.2× SSC buffers. The chips were scanned using the GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), and primary data were analyzed using the Genepix 3.02 software. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate. Control self-hybridizations were performed using wild type RNA to determine S.D. values that were used to determine the eventual cut-off values. Primary data were flagged using four default parameters set in the Genepix 3.0 program. Intensity data for both channels were normalized by the widely used global intensity normalization method (37.Zavadil J. Bitzer M. Liang D. Yang Y.-C. Massimi A. Kneitz S. Piek E. Bottinger E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6686-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The intensity of each spot in each channel was adjusted by subtracting the local background from the observed intensity (I′ij =Iij − Bij, where I′ij, Iij, and Bij are the adjusted intensity, observed intensity, and background for the jth gene (j = 1, 2, … n) in the ith channel (i = 1, 2), respectively), and then subjected to log transformation (ln(I′ij)). The overall intensity for each channel was calculated by taking the power of the average of the log of the adjusted intensity for all genes (ICh1 =eln(I′1j)/n, and ICh2 =eln( I′2 j)/n, where n is the number of genes, and ICh1 and ICh2 are the overall intensity for channel 1 and channel 2, respectively). The intensities for both channels were therefore balanced by multiplying the adjusted intensity of each spot in channel 2 by the ratio of the overall intensity in channel 1 over that in channel 2 (r =ICh1/ICh2). Means and S.D. values were calculated for those genes with no more than one flagged data point. For normalized data tables, see the Supplemental Material. Genes were classified into 12 functional groups (38.Gerstein M. Jansen R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using annotations from the Swissprot data base (available on the World Wide Web at ca.expasy.org/sprot). The tangerin A was identified from ESTAA217475 using the Gencarta data base (Compugen Ltd., Tel Aviv, Israel). All transcripts studied were reverse-transcribed and amplified using the One Step RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). The initial reverse transcriptase step was conducted at 50 °C for 30 min. The annealing temperatures used for individual experiments are indicated in Table I. All amplifications shown here were performed at 29 cycles. All primers used in this study (Table I) were designed to cross intron-exon boundaries and were tested in the absence of reverse transcriptase. Control reactions were performed initially to ensure linearity of amplification over concentrations of total RNA ranging from 5 to 100 ng.Table IPrimers used in this studyPrimer nameSequence (5′–3′)Product lengthAnnealing temperaturebp°CArgininosuccinate synthetaseGAAGCTTGGGGCCAAAAAGG10653ATAGCGGTCCTCGTAGAGTGUridine monophosphate kinaseTGGAAGTGCCCTTTGCTGTC14155CAGTTCAACAAAACCAGCCCAGUbiquitin-conjugating enzymeACTAGACACCCGACCCTTAC13654.9AAAGGATGAGGCTGTGGTGGCoq7/clk1GAAGAGGATTATCCAGGCCG12550.3CCTCCTCCACAAATATCACTCPax6/Pax6(a)CGGCAGAAGATCGTAGAG289/33156GATGACACACTGGGTATGParalemminCGACGAGGACATGAGGAAAC14055.3CTGAATTCTCCTTTGAGGCAGCTangerin AAGTAACCCTGGTGGACAAG29254.8GAGAAGAGGAAATGGGGGAGMOCS3CCCGGTGTATGTGATTTGC14954.6TCCCATCAATTCTGACGGCEtv6TGTGCAGCAGAGACATCTCC14054.8CCGGCAATACACTCCTTACAGCspf1TTGGACAGCCCACTACACAAGG10055CTTCCCAGAGCAACCAACAACAC Open table in a new tab Lenses were dissected from 6-week-old Pax6(5a) transgenic and wild type litter mates and homogenized in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.575 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 45 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Supernatants were collected following two spins at 10,000 × g. Protein concentrations were immediately determined using Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and 56 μg of protein were loaded on each lane of a 10% discontinuous SDS-PAGE gel. The protein was transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-paralemmin rabbit crude serum (39.Kutzleb C. Sanders G. Yamamoto R. Wang X. Lichte B. Petrash-Parwez E. Kilimann M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 795-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Bound antibodies were detected with 1:2000 horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (New England BioLabs). Blots were developed using LumiGLO (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA) and exposed to film. Mouse eyes were enucleated and embedded in Tissue Freezing Medium (Triangle Biomedical Sciences, Durham, NC), and 16-μm frozen sections were prepared. Sections were then fixed in 1:1 acetone/methanol for 10 min at −20 °C and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at RT. Paralemmin and preimmune paralemmin primary antibodies (39.Kutzleb C. Sanders G. Yamamoto R. Wang X. Lichte B. Petrash-Parwez E. Kilimann M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 795-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were prepared in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline at dilutions of 1:150. The bound primary antibodies were visualized following incubation with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 (1:50 dilution in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The cell nuclei were detected by counterstaining with SYTO-13 (1:1000 dilution; Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Königsallee, Göttingen, Germany) configured with an argon/krypton laser (488- and 568-nm excitation lines). A more detailed protocol may be found in Reed et al.(40.Reed N.A. Oh D.-J. Czymmek K.J. Duncan M.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 253: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Initially, lens RNA obtained from 8-week-old NMRI mice was labeled with either Cy5- or Cy3-labeled dendrimers (35.Stears R.L. Getts R.C. Gullans S.R. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 3: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and self-hybridized to cDNA microarrays containing about 9700 sequence-verified genes (36.Cheung V.G. Morley M. Aguilar F. Massimi A. Kucherlapati R. Childs G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21S: 15-19Crossref Scopus (565) Google Scholar) to determine the S.D. value of the hybridization ratios (Cy5/Cy3). Since the S.D. obtained from three independent hybridizations was 0.28–0.31, expression ratios more than 1.60 for up-regulated and less than 0.63 for down-regulated genes are statistically significant, since they represent values that differ by two S.D. values. Genes differentially expressed in Pax6 heterozygous lenses as compared with normal lenses were determined by labeling cDNAs from the two samples with Cy3- and Cy5-specific dendrimers before simultaneously probing onto the cDNA microarrays described above. A representative scatter plot from one experiment showing the distribution of hybridization signals generated using GeneSpring 3.02 software (Silicon Genetics, San Carlos, CA) is shown in Fig. 1A. To demonstrate the reproducibility of data using the 3DNA labeling technology (35.Stears R.L. Getts R.C. Gullans S.R. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 3: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we randomly selected six genes (GenBankTM accession numbersAA387340, AA120030, AA445775, AA238399, AA260490, and AA000249), and their ratios of expression from triplicate microarrays are given in Fig. 1B. This is the first report, to our knowledge, using the 3DNA detection system (Genisphere) and poly-l-lysine-coated slides used to print the microarrays, allowing one to work with 2–5 μg of total RNA without any mRNA amplification step (33.Livesey F.J. Furukawa T. Steffen M.A. Church G.M. Cepko C.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 301-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In addition, the standard deviation of the control experiment, 0.28–0.31, was comparable with direct incorporation methods employing Cy3′ and Cy5′ modified UTP, which typically yielded values between 0.19 and 0.21. 2B. K. Chauhan and A. Cvekl, unpublished data. Normalized data tables can be obtained on the World Wide Web at www.aecom.yu.edu/thecvekllab. Some of the data were flagged due to the unacceptable signal intensity above background intensity (i.e. if the signal intensity above background intensity was less than 100, then the spot would be flagged). This resulted in the identification of more than 400 differentially expressed genes; the vast majority of them were down-regulated, consistent with Pax6 roles as an activator of transcription. From these data, three lists of genes were generated. The first list, shown in Table II, includes genes with known functions classified into 12 subcategories (38.Gerstein M. Jansen R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 574-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), flagged no more than once, and expressed in Pax6 heterozygous lenses at reduced levels up to a factor of 0.63 and up-regulated genes by a factor of at least 1.6. When a single flag was found, we included the data if mean and median values were similar.

Small molecular weight synthetic inhibitors for these enzymes are highly sought for potential use as anti-metastatic agents. Virtually all of the known inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are broad spectrum. We report herein the synthesis and kinetic characterization of two compounds, 4-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)butane-1,2-dithiol (compound 1) and 5-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)pentane-1,2-dithiol (compound 2), that are potent and selective gelatinase inhibitors. These compounds are slow, tight-binding inhibitors of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) with Ki values in the nanomolar range. In contrast, competitive inhibition of the catalytic domain of membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase (MMP-14cat) with comparable Ki values (Ki ∼200 nm) was observed. Binding to stromelysin (MMP-3) was substantially weaker, with Ki values in the micromolar range (Ki ∼10 μm). No binding to matrilysin (MMP-7) and collagenase 1 (MMP-1) was detected at inhibitor concentrations up to 60 μm. We have previously shown that synthetic MMP inhibitors work synergistically with TIMP-2 in the promotion of pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP in a process that depends on the affinity of the inhibitor toward MT1-MMP. It is shown herein that the dithiols are significantly less efficient (>100-fold) than marimastat, a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, in enhancing pro-MMP-2 activation in cells infected to express MT1-MMP, consistent with the lower affinity of the dithiols toward MT1-MMP. Thus, in contrast to broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors, the dithiols are less likely to promote MT1-MMP-dependent pro-MMP-2 activation in the presence of TIMP-2, while maintaining their ability to inhibit active MMP-2 effectively.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumMe2SOdimethyl sulfoxideMT-MMPmembrane-type MMPTIMPtissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase are zinc-dependent endopeptidases known to play key roles in normal and pathological conditions involving remodeling and turnover of extracellular matrix, such as embryonic development, wound healing, angiogenesis, arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. In cancer, MMPs are known to be required at all stages of tumorigenesis, including tumor establishment and growth, neovascularization, intravasation, extravasation, and metastasis (1.Kleiner D.E. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 43: S42-S51Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar,2.McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). MMPs are expressed as zymogenic latent enzymes. The zymogenic form has a propeptide that achieves coordination to the catalytic zinc ion by a strictly conserved cysteine residue (for a comparative review of MMP structures see Ref. 3.Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). MMP activation occurs when the cysteine thiolate-zinc ion coordination is broken, usually as a consequence of two proteolytic cleavages of the propeptide, either by autolysis or by hydrolytic action of other proteinases (4.Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Murphy G. Stanton H. Cowell S. Butler G. Knauper V. Atkinson S. Gavrilovic J. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol.

Soc. 2001; 123: 3108-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MMPs are inhibited by the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), a family of four proteins that are the natural inhibitors of MMPs. matrix metalloproteinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium dimethyl sulfoxide membrane-type MMP tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase A subgroup of the MMP family, gelatinases A and B (MMP-2 and MMP-9, respectively), has been shown to play a key role in angiogenesis and tumor metastasis (7.Moses M.A. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8.Nguyen M. Arkell J. Jackson C.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 960-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). MMP-2 has been the subject of intense investigation since the observation was made that its activation correlates with tumor spread and poor prognosis (9.Seiki M. Acta Pathol. Microbiol. Immunol. Scand. 1999; 107: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Latent MMP-2 (pro-MMP-2) is activated by membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs) (10.Polette M. Birembaut P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 1195-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 11.Ellerbroek S.M. Stack M.S. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 940-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), a unique MMP subfamily currently comprising six members (MT1- to MT6-MMP). Contrary to the other MMPs, which are secreted into the extracellular milieu, the MT-MMPs are tethered to the plasma membrane either by a transmembrane domain (MT1-, MT2-, MT-3 and MT5-MMP) or by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (MT4- and MT6-MMP). MT1-MMP (MMP-14) (12.Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2377) Google Scholar) is known to be the primary pro-MMP-2 physiological activator through a highly regulated mechanism (13.Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) involving TIMP-2 (14.Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). It has been shown that TIMP-2 binds active MT1-MMP through the N-terminal cysteine residue (15.Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 16.Butler G.S. Butler M.J. Atkinson S.J. Will H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 871-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), whereas the C-terminal domain of TIMP-2 interacts with the hemopexin-like domain of pro-MMP-2 (17.Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), forming a ternary complex (18.Strongin A.Y. Collier I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) that efficiently concentrates pro-MMP-2 on the cell surface, thereby promoting its interaction with a neighboring TIMP-2-free MT1-MMP. MT1-MMP cleaves pro-MMP-2 at the Asn37–Leu38 peptide bond, generating an inactive 64-kDa intermediate. Subsequently, a second autolytic cleavage at Asn80–Tyr81 bond achieves the full activation of pro-MMP-2 (19.Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). This process requires protonation of the coordinated cysteine thiolate before its dissociation from the active site zinc ion (6.Kotra L.P. Cross J.B. Shimura Y. Fridman R. Schlegel H.B. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3108-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The key role that MMPs play in neovascularization and metastasis has made these enzymes major targets for therapeutic intervention, and therefore synthetic small molecular weight MMP inhibitors are highly sought. Several orally active MMP inhibitors were synthesized and tested in animal models yielding encouraging results (20.Shalinsky D.R. Brekken J. Zou H. Bloom L.A. McDermott C.D. Zook S. Varki N.M. Appelt K. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1905-1917PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Price A. Shi Q. Morris D. Wilcox M.E. Brasher P.M. Rewcastle N.B. Shalinsky D. Zou H. Appelt K. Johnston R.N. Yong V.W. Edwards D. Forsyth P. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 845-854PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these MMP inhibitors, including the broad-spectrum hydroxamate-based batimastat and marimastat (22.Rasmussen H.S. McCann P.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 23.Brown P.D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 52: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), reached phase 3 of clinical trials. However, administration of these inhibitors, either alone or in combination with standard chemotherapeutic agents, to cancer patients produced severe side effects and showed no clinical efficacy. The current view is that these trials were misguided because the subjects had pre-existing metastasis and improved survival rates should not have been anticipated (24.Zucker S. Cao J. Chen W.T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6642-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a recent study (25.Kruger A. Soeltl R. Sopov I. Kopitz C. Arlt M. Magdolen V. Harbeck N. Gansbacher B. Schmitt M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1272-1275PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that batimastat administration led to liver metastasis in mice inoculated with human breast carcinoma cells. Results from our laboratories (26.Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Soloway P.D. Wang Z. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. DeClerck Y.A. Tschesche H. Cher M.L. Brown S. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41415-41423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) showed that both batimastat and marimastat, in concert with TIMP-2, enhanced MT1-MMP-dependent pro-MMP-2 activation when compared with the activation observed with TIMP-2 alone. On the cell membrane, active MT1-MMP (57 kDa) undergoes autolysis and shedding of the catalytic domain, yielding a major membrane-bound species of 44 kDa, which is devoid of proteolytic activity (27.Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M. Gervasi D.C. Raz Y. Sang Q.A. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12080-12089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Binding of TIMP-2 or of a synthetic MMP inhibitor to active MT1-MMP prevents autolysis, resulting in accumulation of enzyme on the cell surface. We have shown that in the presence of TIMP-2 accumulation of active MT1-MMP by synthetic MMP inhibitors can generate MT1-MMP·TIMP-2 complexes on the cell surface, which then promote pro-MMP-2 activation (26.Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Soloway P.D. Wang Z. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. DeClerck Y.A. Tschesche H. Cher M.L. Brown S. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41415-41423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, under certain conditions, synthetic MMP inhibitors with high affinity toward MT1-MMP can enhance the effects of TIMP-2 in pro-MMP-2 activation by MT1-MMP. We have recently reported the first mechanism-based inhibitor (“suicide substrate”) for MMPs, SB-3CT (28.Brown S. Bernardo M.M. Li Z.-H. Kotra L.P. Tanaka Y. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6799-6800Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 29.Kleifeld O. Kotra L.P. Gervasi D.C. Brown S. Bernardo M.M. Fridman R. Mobashery S. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17125-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which exhibits high selectivity for the gelatinases but poor affinity for MT1-MMP. Consistently, SB-3CT does not enhance the MT1-MMP-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2 in the presence of TIMP-2 (26.Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Soloway P.D. Wang Z. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. DeClerck Y.A. Tschesche H. Cher M.L. Brown S. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41415-41423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, selective inhibitors for gelatinases may have clinical advantages by reducing side effects and improving efficacy. We report herein the synthesis and kinetic characterization of two novel inhibitors, 4-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)butane-1,2-dithiol (1) and 5-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)pentane-1,2-dithiol (2), which also exhibit selectivity toward gelatinases. However, their mechanisms of inhibition are different. A comparative study of these compounds on the activation of pro-MMP-2 in cells expressing MT1-MMP shows that, when compared with marimastat, significantly higher dithiol concentrations are required for active MT1-MMP binding and enhancement of pro-MMP-2 activation in the presence of TIMP-2. Moreover, at higher concentrations both marimastat and the dithiols inhibit MMP-2, leading to accumulation of the 64-kDa MMP-2 inactive intermediate and preventing further MMP-2 generation. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on either a Varian Gemini-300, a Varian Mercury-400, or a Varian Unity-500 spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm from tetramethylsilane on the δ scale. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 680 DSP spectrophotometer. Mass spectra were recorded on a Kratos MS 80RFT spectrometer. Melting points were taken on an electrothermal melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. Thin-layer chromatography was performed with Whatman 0.25-mm silica gel 60-F plates. All other reagents were purchased from either Aldrich or Across Organics. 2-(4-Phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)ethylthiirane and 3-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)propylthiirane were prepared according to the method reported previously (28.Brown S.

A solution of sodium hydrosulfide (13 mg, 0.18 mmol) in methanol (0.5 ml) was cooled to 0 °C. Hydrogen sulfide gas was then bubbled slowly through the solution for 5 min. To this solution was added 2-(4-phenoxyphenylsulfonyl)ethylthiirane (39 mg, 0.12 mmol) in chloroform/methanol (1:2, 0.8 ml) over a period of 10 min, with continuous bubbling of hydrogen sulfide. This mixture was stirred at 0 °C for a further 30 min and then at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was poured into water (20 ml) and then acidified with a few drops of sulfuric acid (1 m) before extraction with ether (3 × 10 ml). The combined organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated to give the desired product as a waxy, white solid (42 mg, 99%). 1H (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ7.86–7.83 (m, 2H), 7.44–7.40 (m, 2H), 7.26–7.22 (m, 1H), 7.10–7.06 (m, 5H), 3.41–3.34 (m, 1H), 3.25–3.18 (m, 1H), 3.02–2.93 (m, 1H), 2.84–2.69 (m, 2H), 2.36–2.26 (m, 1H), 1.90–1.80 (m, 1H), 1.66 (d, J6 Hz, 1H), 1.64 (t, J8.8 Hz, 1H); 13C (100 MHz, CDCl3) δ162.94, 155.02, 132.54, 130.55, 130.51, 125.48, 120.70, 117.94, 54.57, 42.44, 34.13, 29.91; m/z (EI) 320 ([M − SH2]+, 30%), 235 (40.Holmquist B.

Heat-activated human stromelysin 1 (MMP-3) was generously provided by Dr. Paul Cannon (Center for Bone and Joint Research, Palo Alto, CA). Pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 were activated by incubation with p-aminophenylmercuric acetate and heat-activated stromelysin 1, respectively, as described previously (28.Brown S. Bernardo M.M. Li Z.-H.

The recombinant catalytic domain of human MT1-MMP (MMP-14cat) encompassing residues Ile114–Ile318 expressed in Escherichia coli (33.Lichte A. Kolkenbrock H. Tschesche H.

Recombinant human active matrilysin (MMP-7) was obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Human recombinant interstitial collagenase (pro-MMP-1) was a generous gift from Dr. William Parks (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Pro-MMP-1 was activated by incubation with p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (1 mm) in a buffer consisting of 0.1 m Tris, 10 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5. The concentrations of heat-activated stromelysin 1 and MMP-9 were determined by active site titration with recombinant TIMP-1, whereas MMP-2, MMP-7, and MT1-MMPcatconcentrations were obtained by titration with recombinant TIMP-2. The hydroxamate-based inhibitors marimastat (BB-2516) and batimastat (BB-94) were obtained from British Biotech (Annapolis, MD). Stock solutions of marimastat, batimastat, and the dithiol compounds were prepared in Me2SO in the millimolar concentration range. Fluorescence was measured with a PTI spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International) interfaced to a Pentium computer equipped with RadioMasterTM and FeliXTM hardware and software, respectively. The assays were carried out at 25.0 °C, and the cuvette holder was thermostatted at the same temperature. Excitation and emission band passes of 1 and 3 nm, respectively, were used. Fluorescence measurements were taken every 4 s. MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-7, and MT1-MMP activities were monitored with the fluorescence-quenched substrate MOCAcPLGLA2pr(Dnp)AR-NH2 at excitation and emission wavelengths of 328 and 393 nm, respectively. MOCAcRPKPVE(Nva)WRK(Dnp)NH2 was the fluorogenic substrate used to monitor MMP-3 enzymatic activity at 325 and 393 nm. MMP-1 activity was assayed with the fluorogenic synthetic substrate (Dnp)P(Cha)GC(Me)HAK(NMa)NH2 at 340 and 440 nm. All fluorogenic substrates were obtained from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, KY). Less than 10% hydrolysis of the substrates was monitored as described by Knight (34.Knight C.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The assays were performed as described previously (35.Olson M.W. Bernardo M.M. Pietila M. Gervasi D.C. Toth M. Kotra L.P. Massova I. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol.

Progress curves for slow-binding inhibition analysis were obtained by adding enzyme (0.5–1 nm) to a mixture of MOCAcPLGLA2pr(Dnp)AR-NH2(7 μm) and varying concentrations of the dithiol inhibitors in buffer R (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Brij-35, and 5% Me2SO; final volume 2 ml) in acrylic cuvettes with stirring. Hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate was monitored for 15 to 30 min. The progress curves were nonlinear least squares fitted to Equation 1 (36.Muller-Steffner H.M. Malver O. Hosie L.

The obtained k values, vo and vs, were further analyzed according to Equations 2 and 3 for a one-step association mechanism. k=koff+kon[I]/(1+[S]/Km)Equation 2 (vo−vs)/vs=[I]/(Ki(1+[S]/Km))Equation 3 The Km values used for the reaction of MMP-2 and MMP-9 with the fluorogenic substrate were 2.46 ± 0.34 and 3.06 ± 0.74 μm, respectively (17.Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Intercept and slope values, obtained by linear regression of the k versusinhibitor concentration plot (Eq. 2), yielded the association and dissociation rate constants kon and koff, respectively, and the inhibition constant Ki(koff/kon). Alternatively, Ki was determined from the slope of the (vo − vs)/vsversus [I] plot according to Equation 3. The dissociation rate constants were determined independently from the enzyme activity recovered after dilution of a preformed enzyme-inhibitor complex. Thus, 200–400 nm enzyme was incubated with ∼100 μm inhibitor for at least 45 min at 25.0 °C. The complex was diluted 400-fold into 2 ml of buffer R containing fluorogenic substrate (10 μm final concentration). Recovery of enzyme activity was monitored for 60 min. The data were analyzed as described elsewhere (26.Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Gervasi D.C. Soloway P.D. Wang Z. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. DeClerck Y.A. Tschesche H. Cher M.L. Brown S. Mobashery S. Fridman R.

For competitive inhibition, the initial rates were obtained by adding enzyme (0.5 nm) to a mixture of fluorogenic substrate (7 μm) and varying concentrations of inhibitor in buffer R (final volume 1 ml) in quartz semi-micro cuvettes and monitoring the increase in fluorescence with time for 5–10 min. The initial velocities were determined by linear regression analysis of the fluorescence versus time traces using FeliXTM. The initial rates were fitted to Equation 4(37.Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics.

After infection the cells were rinsed with serum-free DMEM supplemented with l-glutamine and antibiotics and incubated in the same medium containing varying concentrations of synthetic inhibitors. After ∼16 h the inhibitor-containing media were aspirated, and the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with Opti-MEM, without phenol red, supplemented with pro-MMP-2 (25 nm). At varying times, media aliquots were removed and MMP-2 activity was assayed with MOCAcPLGLA2pr(Dnp)AR-NH2, as described (35.Olson M.W. Bernardo M.M. Pietila M. Gervasi D.C. Toth M. Kotra L.P.

After 4–6 h the remaining media were collected, and the cells were rinsed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 100 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (1 pellet of Complete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Diagnostics/10 ml of buffer). The media and lysate samples were analyzed for pro-MMP-2 cleavage by gelatin zymography. The lysates were also subjected to immunoblot analysis to ascertain the level of MT1-MMP expression and processing as described below. Gelatin zymography was performed using 8% Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin under nonreducing conditions as described previously (38.Toth, M., Gervasi, D. C., and Fridman, R. (1997) p. 105, @@[email protected]@Cancer [email protected]@/[email protected]@ 57, 3159–3167Google Scholar). The samples for immunoblot analysis were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The transferred proteins were developed using rabbit polyclonal antibody 437 to MT1-MMP (39.Gervasi D.C. Raz A. Dehem M. Yang M. Kurkinen M. Fridman R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

https://openalex.org/W2111016560,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is known for its potent effect on neuronal survival, but its role in the development and function of synapses is not well studied. Using Xenopus nerve-muscle co-cultures, we show that GDNF and its family member neurturin (NRTN) facilitate the development of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Long-term application of GDNF significantly increased the total length of neurites in the motoneurons. GDNF also caused an increase in the number and the size of synaptic vesicle clustering, as demonstrated by synaptobrevin-GFP fluorescent imaging, and FM dye staining. Electrophysiological experiments revealed two effects of GDNF on synaptic transmission at NMJ. First, GDNF markedly increased the frequency of spontaneous transmission and decreased the variability of evoked transmission, suggesting an enhancement of transmitter secretion. Second, GDNF elicited a small increase in the quantal size, without affecting the average rise and decay times of synaptic currents. Imaging analysis showed that the size of acetylcholine receptor clusters at synapses increased in muscle cells overexpressing GDNF. Neurturin had very similar effects as GDNF. These results suggest that GDNF and NRTN are new neuromodulators that regulate the development of the neuromuscular synapse through both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms.

Subsequent experiments from many laboratories have demonstrated regulatory effects of neurotrophins on synapses in a variety of model systems. For example, changes in the level of BDNF in the visual cortex alter the development of ocular dominance synapses (5Cabelli R.J. Horn A. Shatz C.J.

Despite of the rapid progress, a number of important issues still await to be addressed. For example, while the acute effects of neurotrophic factors on synaptic transmission have attracted a great deal of interest, much less is known about cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the long-term synaptotrophic effects. The relationships between the acute and long-term neurotrophic effects remain unclear. Furthermore, the synaptic functions of trophic factors other than neurotrophins were largely unexplored. In this paper, we study the long-term effects of GDNF and its family member neurturin on the development of the neuromuscular synapse, and their potential mechanisms. GDNF belongs to a newly identified family of neurotrophic factors, which include GDNF, NRTN, artemin, and persephin (27Lin L.F. Doherty D.H. Lile J.D. Bektesh S. Collins F.

The functions of GDNF ligands are mediated by a two-component receptor complex. One is a common signaling component, the c-Ret receptor tyrosine kinase, and the other a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein called GFR-α, which binds ligand with high affinity and determines the specificity (for review, see Refs. 31Baloh R.H.

One of the major targets of GDNF is the motoneuron in the spinal cord. Several lines of evidence suggest that GDNF attenuates programmed cell death of motoneurons during development (37Henderson C.E.

Parsadanian A.S. Snider W.D. Lichtman J.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1725-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). While these results raise the possibility that GDNF and NRTN produced in the target muscle cells may retrogradely regulate spinal motoneurons, the exact role of these GDNF ligands in the development and/or function of the NMJ remains to be established. Because of its simplicity and easy accessibility for molecular manipulation at pre- and postsynaptic sites, the NMJ has long been an excellent model system to study synaptic transmission and synapse development (50Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). One area that the NMJ preparation is particularly useful is to study the development of quantal transmission mechanism. Experiments using Xenopus nerve-muscle cultures have described a series of physiological and morphological events associated with the developmental process (51Kullberg R.W. Lentz T.L. Cohen M.W. Dev. Biol. 1977; 60: 101-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 52Nakajima Y. Kidokoro Y. Klier F.G. Dev. Biol. 1980; 77: 52-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The physiological events include a gradual increase of the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous synaptic currents (SSCs) (53Evers J. Laser M. Sun Y.-A. Xie Z.-P. Poo M.-M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1523-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a striking transition from a skew to a bell-shaped distribution of SSC amplitudes (54Kidokoro Y. Neurosci. Res. 1984; 1: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 55Lu B. Greengard P. Poo M.-M. Neuron. 1992; 8: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, the amplitudes of impulse-evoked synaptic currents (ESCs) become much larger and more consistent (53Evers J. Laser M. Sun Y.-A. Xie Z.-P. Poo M.-M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1523-1539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 54Kidokoro Y. Neurosci. Res. 1984; 1: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 55Lu B. Greengard P. Poo M.-M.

Morphologically, synaptic vesicles gradually aggregate to form synaptic varicosities, both pre- and postsynaptic membranes thicken, and basal lamina material appears in the synaptic cleft (51Kullberg R.W. Lentz T.L. Cohen M.W. Dev. Biol. 1977; 60: 101-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 52Nakajima Y. Kidokoro Y. Klier F.G. Dev.

Moreover, ACh receptors (AChR) gradually cluster on the postsynaptic membrane at the NMJ (56Kidokoro Y. Anderson M.J. Gruner R. Dev. Biol. 1980; 78: 464-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A series of recent studies have demonstrated the long-term enhancement of synaptic efficacy at the neuromuscular synapse by neurotrophins. These effects may involve changes in both the quantal secretion mechanism in the presynaptic site (23Wang T. Xie K.W. Lu B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4796-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Liou J.C. Yang R.S. Fu W.M. J. Physiol. i. 1997; 503: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Liou J.C. Fu W.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2459-2468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the AChR channel properties in the postsynaptic site (20Wang X.H. Poo M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 825-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 60Gonzalez M. Ruggiero F.P. Chang Q. Shi Y.J. Rich M.M. Kraner S. Balice-Gordon R.J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 567-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the role of the GDNF family of neurotrophic factors in the development of the neuromuscular synapse. We found that long-term treatment of the Xenopus nerve-muscle co-culture with GDNF or NRTN significantly promotes axonal growth, and facilitates aggregation of synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic terminals. Furthermore, we show that GDNF and NRTN enhance not only transmitter release, but also AChR clustering. These results define a new role of GDNF and NRTN in quantal synaptic transmission, and provide new insights into how long-term regulation of synapse development can be achieved. Human GDNF, NRTN, or enhanced green fluorescence protein (GFP) (from CLONTECH) cDNA was subcloned into the pSP6TS vector containing the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of theXenopus β-globin gene (kindly provided by Yi Rao, Washington University). The cDNA for synaptobrevin-GFP (GFP fused in-frame at the C terminus of synaptobrevin, cloned in pS65T vector) was a gift from Susana Cohen-Cory of UCLA. The plasmids were linearized and extracted by phenol/chloroform. Capped mRNAs for GDNF, NRTN, GFP, and synaptobrevin-GFP were prepared by in vitrotranscription using the linearized plasmids, RNA polymerase (SP6 or T3), and mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion). Quality of mRNA was determined first by RNA agarose gel, and then by an in vitrotranslation system (TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate). GDNF or NRTN mRNA, but not GFP-synaptobrevin mRNA, was mixed with GFP mRNA at 1:1 ratio. The mRNAs were injected into one of the blastomeres at the 2–4-cell stage using a Picrospritzer. The final concentration of the mRNAs within an injected blastomere was ∼5 ng/μl, and injection volume was ∼1.5 nl. After injection, the injected embryos were placed in a 25 °C incubator for 1 day, and neural tube and associated myotomal tissues from stage 20 to 22 embryos were used to prepare nerve-muscle cultures. Xenopus nerve-muscle cultures were prepared according to the procedure described previously (55Lu B. Greengard P. Poo M.-M. Neuron. 1992; 8: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, neural tube and associated myotomal tissue of stage 20 to 22 Xenopus embryos were dissociated in Ca2+-Mg2+-free saline supplemented with EDTA (58.2 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm KCl, 0.3 mmEDTA, pH 7.4) for 15–20 min. Cells were plated on glass coverslips, and grown in the presence or absence of different factors for 1–3 days at room temperature (20 °C). The culture medium consisted (v/v) of 50% L-15 medium (Sigma), 1% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and 49% Ringer's solution (115 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Various neurotrophic factors (human GDNF, NRTN, or transforming growth factor-β1, etc. from PeproTech or Amgen) and/or antibodies (anti-GFR-α1, or anti-GFR-α2, Santa Cruz) were added to the cultures after cells were completely settled (6 h after plating), and kept in the medium until the time of experiments (1 day, 1-day). For longer term experiments (2–3 days), the factors were added every 12–24 h. Fluorescent images of GFP-synaptobrevin were acquired by a MicroMax 1300 cool CCD camera (Roper Scientific) mounted on a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope and analyzed using IPLab software (Scanalytics). Fluorescence images were taken with 1-s exposure time with a ×40, 0.85NA objective. The pseudo color (green) was assigned to fluorescent images and the superimposed DIC and fluorescence images were created by the IPLab software. For quantitative analysis, we first calculated background intensity by averaging the numbers obtained from three non-fluorescent areas along an axon. Next we set the threshold for detecting fluorescent spots to 50% above the background intensity of that cell, and normalized the intensity of the fluorescent spots (50% above the threshold) to the background intensity. Fluorescent spots larger than 2.3 (1.52 = 2.25) μm2 were defined as synaptic vesicle clusters. The number, size, and intensity of the fluorescence spots were measured, using the region-of-interest tools in the IPLAB program. The FM dye labeling was carried out as described (61Betz W.J. Mao F. Bewick G.S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 363-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 62Ryan T.A. Reuter H. Wendland B. Schweizer F.E. Tsien R.W. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fluorescent styryl membrane dye FM 1–43 (Molecular Probes) was loaded into the spinal neurons by incubating the control, GDNF-, or NRTN-treated cultures with high K+ loading solution containing (KCl, 60 mm;NaCl, 57.6 mm; CaCl2, 3.5 mm;Hepes, 10 mm, pH 7.6; FM 1–43, 2 μm) for 2 min. Cells were then rinsed extensively with Ringer's solution, lightly fixed (2% paraformaldehyde in Ringer's), and rinsed again. The culture coverslips were mounted onto glass slides, and imaged under an upright fluorescence microscope with a standard GFP filter set, and a ×60 oil emersion objective (N.A. 1.5). The images were acquired by the MicroMax camera and analyzed by the IPLab software as described above. Synaptic currents were recorded from innervated muscle cells using whole cell recording techniques at room temperature in culture medium (55Lu B. Greengard P. Poo M.-M. Neuron. 1992; 8: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The solution inside the whole cell recording pipette contained 150 mm KCl, 1 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.2). To elicit evoked synaptic currents, square current pulses (0.5 ms, 0.5–5 volts, 0.05 Hz) were applied with a patch electrode filled with Ringer's solution at neuronal somata under loose seal conditions. All data were collected using a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7), with a current signal filtered at 3 kHz. The data were stored on a videotape recorder for later playback on a storage oscilloscope (Textronic TDS 420) and a chart recorder (Gould EasyGraf 240), or analysis by a desktop computer. The amplitude, rise, and decay times of SSCs and ESCs were analyzed using the SCAN program (Dagan, Inc.). The Xenopus cultures were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.125% glutaraldehyde (EM Science) for 15 min at room temperature, and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For phospho-Akt (pAkt), the cells were permeabilized with 0.125% Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 5 min. For cell surface protein (GFR-α1, GFR-α2, and c-Ret), the permeabilization step was eliminated. All cultures were incubated with 10% H2O2 in PBS overnight at 4 °C to block the endogenous peroxidase activity and rinsed again for 3 times in PBS. The cultures were treated with a blocking solution (50% normal goat serum in PBS) for 3 h in room temperature, and then incubated with the following primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight: c-Ret, GFR-α1, or GFR-α2 (all goat antibodies from Santa Cruz, diluted in PBS by 1:500, or 0.4 μg/ml), and pAkt (rabbit antibody from Promega, diluted at 1:100 in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS). Pretreatment of the cultures with the peptides used to generate the antibodies against GFR-α1 and GFR-α2 (N-18 and C-20, 4 μg/ml, overnight at room temperature), respectively, prevented the specific stainings by the primary antibodies. Thus, these antibodies were capable of detecting endogenousXenopus GFR-α1 and GFR-α2. After incubation with primary antibodies, the cultures were extensively washed (5 times in PBS), incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit for GDNF receptors and horse anti-goat for pAkt, 1:1000, all from Vector) in PBS for 30 min, rinsed 5 times again, and reacted with ABC reagent according to manufacturer's instructions (ABC kit, Vector), all done in room temperature. The cultures were then washed 5 times in PBS, and 2 times in TBS, reacted with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride at low concentration for 1 min, and washed again 2 times in PBS. The cells were dehydrolyzed with alcohol and xyline and the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with a mounting solution (Fisher). The images of immunocytochemistry were viewed using a DIC microscope with a ×40 objective, captured by the Optronics CCD camera and exported to a desktop computer. At least 20 neurons from several different batches of cultures were examined for each condition, and consistent results were obtained. AChR clusters were labeled with rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX), as previously described (63Peng H.B. Cheng P.C. J. Neurosci. 1982; 2: 1760-1774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the nerve-muscle cultures (1-day old) were incubated with α-BTX (0.2 μm, Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Following labeling, the cultures were rinsed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde (EM Sciences) in PBS for 15 min. The fixed cells then were rinsed with PBS and distilled water for 5 min, respectively, dehydrolyzed, and mounted onto glass slides with a mounting solution (Fisher). Images of AChR clusters on either isolated or innervated myocytes were acquired in the same way described above. The numbers, intensity, and area of the clusters were analyzed using the region-of-interest tools in the IPLAB program. In an attempt to thoroughly characterize the role of GDNF or NRTN in neuromuscular development, we first examined whether these factors can induce any morphological changes in the presynaptic motoneurons. The nerve-muscle co-cultures were grown in the absence or presence of GDNF or NRTN for 1–3 days. We measured total neurite length (summation of the lengths of all neurites per neuron). Long-term treatment of the cultures with GDNF (1 ng/ml, in this and all other experiments unless indicated otherwise) resulted in a dramatic increase in total neurite length of the motor axons (Fig. 1, A andB). The effects could be observed as short as 1 day, but longer treatments (2–3 days) elicited more pronounced effects. Quantitation of data from 1-day cultures indicates that treatment with GDNF increased the total neurite length by 83% (Fig. 1 D). Neurturin had similar effects but required a higher concentration (10 ng/ml, Fig. 1). In these cultures, many neurons exhibited “morphological varicosities” (enlargements larger than 2 times axon diameter) along their axons, resembling synaptic varicosities (Fig. 1). Treatment with GDNF and NRTN also increased the number of these morphological varicosities. Synaptic varicosities contain clusters of synaptic vesicles as well as other presynaptic elements such as machineries for exocytosis and endocytosis, and therefore are considered as the morphological basis of nerve terminals. To determine whether synaptic vesicles were indeed clustered in these morphological varicosity, we labeled all synaptic vesicles and their precursors using the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin fused with green fluorescence protein at its C terminus (synaptobrevin-GFP). Messenger RNA for the synaptobrevin-GFP fusion protein was injected into one of the Xenopus blastomeres at the 2-cell stage. Neurons and muscle cells derived from the injected embryos were plated at low density on glass-bottom culture dishes. Live cells grown in the presence or absence of GDNF or NRTN for 2 days were imaged in an inverted fluorescence microscope. Fig.2 A shows an example of a motoneuron exhibiting synaptobrevin-GFP fluorescent spots along their axons. Single vesicles are too small to be resolved by light microscopy. These spots therefore represent clusters of synaptobrevin-GFP containing synaptic vesicles or “pre-assembled terminals” (64Ahmari S.E. Buchanan J. Smith S.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Comparis"
https://openalex.org/W2326300557,The aim of this study was to determine whether constitutive ErbB2 activation controls growth and apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Growth arrested GEO cells showed constitutive activation of ErbB2 in the absence of exogenous growth factors or serum supplementation. Higher levels of heregulin and ErbB2 activation were observed in the growth-arrested state and cell cycle re-entry was independent of exogenous growth factors. Blockade of ErbB2 activation by heregulin neutralizing antibodies and by AG879 resulted in prevention of cell cycle re-entry. This indicated that autocrine heregulin activity was responsible for growth factor independence and for cell cycle re-entry. Activation of ErbB2 was the result of heregulin mediated interaction with ErbB3 and generated downstream activation of the ERK and the PI3K/AKT pathways. Heregulin neutralizing antibody treatment of growth arrested GEO cells also generated apoptosis as reflected by PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation indicating a cell survival signal was also induced by the constitutively activated ErbB2. The activation of AKT but not the MAPK pathway was responsible for cell survival in these cells.
https://openalex.org/W2112840365,"A library of fluorescently labeled protein kinase C (PKC) peptide substrates was prepared to identify a phosphorylation-induced reporter of protein kinase activity. The lead PKC substrate displays a 2.5-fold change in fluorescence intensity upon phosphorylation. PKC activity is readily sampled in cell lysates containing the activated PKCs. Immunodepletion of conventional PKCs from the cell lysate eliminates the fluorescence response, suggesting that this peptide substrate is selectively phosphorylated by PKCα, β, and γ. Finally, living cells microinjected with the peptide substrate exhibit a 2-fold increase in fluorescence intensity upon exposure to a PKC activator. These results suggest that peptide-based protein kinase biosensors may be useful in monitoring the temporal and spatial dynamics of PKC activity in living cells.

Protein kinases, as well as the signal transduction pathways in which they participate, are now recognized to be medicinally attractive targets of opportunity (1.Sebolt-Leopold J.S.

Inhibitors of the protein kinase family not only hold great promise as therapeutic agents but are also of profound utility in the characterization of signaling pathways (5.Lawrence D.S. Niu J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 81-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The direct visualization of protein kinase activity in living cells would provide a genuine assessment of the efficacy and selectivity of these inhibitors in a physiological setting. In addition, the ability to visualize the activity of a protein kinase in real time would furnish a direct measurement of the activation of specific signaling pathways in response to extracellular stimuli. A variety of different strategies have been described to assess protein kinase activity in cell-based systems. Ng et al. (6.Ng T. Squire A. Hansra G. Bornancin F. Prevostel C. Hanby A. Harris W.

Phosphorylation of this protein generates a 23% decrease in fluorescence energy resonance transfer between the two green fluorescent proteins. By contrast, previous attempts to obtain phosphorylation-responsive fluorescently tagged peptides have been disappointing. The phosphorylation-induced change in fluorescence intensity in these systems is modest (<20%) (8.Post P.L. Trybus K.M. Taylor D.L. J. Biol.

Nonetheless, peptide substrates possess a number of inherent advantages, including ready synthetic availability, straightforward modification with the wide array of commercially available fluorophores (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the potential for complete temporal and spatial control over both when and where the substrate is phosphorylated (11.Wood J.

We describe herein a conceptually different, library-based approach for the construction and identification of peptide-based reporters of protein kinase activity. The lead fluorophore-tagged peptide from this library displays a phosphorylation-induced change in fluorescence that is an order of magnitude greater than previously described fluorophore-bearing peptide/protein substrates of protein kinases. Indeed, this lead compound serves as an effective fluorescent sensor of protein kinase activity in both cell lysates and living cells. protein kinase C benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl high performance liquid chromatography 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid protein kinase C benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl high performance liquid chromatography 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid All chemicals were obtained from Aldrich, except for [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), bovine serum albumin, protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), protected amino acid derivatives and Rink resin (Advanced ChemTech), antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Liquiscint (National Diagnostics). The α-, βII-, and γ-isoforms of protein kinase C were purchased from Panvera. Peptides and peptide libraries were synthesized using protocols analogous to those described previously (24.Yan X. Curley K. Lawrence D.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A standard Fmoc/benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (Bop) peptide synthesis protocol was employed to synthesize this peptide on the Rink resin via an automated peptide synthesizer. Each amino acid was attached according to the following program (for a 2-g resin scale): (a) 3 × 30 ml of CH2Cl2; (b) 1 × 20 ml of 30% piperidine in CH2Cl2 (1 min); (c) 1 × 30 ml of 30% piperidine in CH2Cl2 (20 min); (d) 2 × 30 ml of CH2Cl2; (e) 1 × 30 ml of isopropyl alcohol; (f) 3 × 30 ml of CH2Cl2; (g) 1 × 30 ml of four equivalents of N-methyl morpholine in CH2Cl2; (h) three equivalents of Fmoc-protected amino acid, Bop, hydroxybenzotriazole, and six equivalents of N-methyl morpholine in 30 ml of CH2Cl2/N, N-dimethylformamide (1:1) (60–90 min) (the coupling time was 90 min for all the Arg residues and 60 min for the other residues); (i) 3 × 30 ml of CH2Cl2; (j) 3 × 30 ml of 33% ethanol in CH2Cl2.; (k) 2 × 30 ml of CH2Cl2. After completion of the desired amino acid sequence, the Fmoc group was removed with 30 ml of 30% piperidine (30 min), and the resulting side chain-protected species, H2N-Ser(tBu)-Phe-[Arg(Mtr)]4-Lys(Boc)-[Rink Resin], was treated with 10 equivalents of NBD-Cl and N-methyl morpholine in 1:1 CH2Cl2/N, N-dimethylformamide (2 ml) for 24 h to furnish the resin-linked NBD-modified peptide: NBD-HN-Ser(tBu)-Phe-[Arg(Mtr)]4-Lys(Boc)-[Rink Resin]. The protocol employed for peptide 2 was likewise used to synthesize 3 with the following exceptions:N-α-Fmoc-N-ε-1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohex-1-ylidene)ethyl-Lys (“Fmoc-Lys(Dde)”) was used in place of Fmoc-Lys(tBoc). Upon synthesis of the Ac-HN-Ser(tBu)-Phe-[Arg(Mtr)]4-Lys(Dde)-[Rink Resin], the Dde protecting group was removed with hydrazine and the ε-amino moiety of Lys modified with NBD-Cl as described above. The NBD-peptide-Rink resins (i.e. 2 and 3) were deprotected and cleaved as follows: each peptide resin (100 mg) was individually transferred to a small reaction vessel containing 1 ml of a 9:1 trifluoroacetic acid/thioanisole mixture. The reaction vessel was then shaken at room temperature for 10 h. The resin was filtered under reduced pressure and then washed twice with trifluoroacetic acid. The filtrates were then combined (∼5 ml), and an 8–10-fold volume of cold anhydrous ether (∼ 50 ml) was added in a dropwise fashion. The mixture was kept at 4 °C for at least 1 h. The precipitated peptide was then collected via filtration through a fine sintered glass filter funnel under a light vacuum. The precipitate was washed with cold anhydrous ether (2 × 5 ml), dissolved in 10 ml of water, and finally lyophilized to provide the crude peptide. The peptides were then purified on a preparative HPLC using three Waters radial compression modules (25 × 10 cm) connected in series (gradient A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; solvent B: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile): 0–3 min (100% gradient A); a linear gradient from 3 to 20 min (75% gradient A and 25% solvent B); a steep final linear gradient to 90% solvent B for cleaning purposes). Peptides 2 and 3 were characterized by mass spectrometry. In the case of the 417-member library, peptide 1 was cleaved from the Rink resin with 90% trifluoroacetic acid/10% thioanisole, purified by HPLC, and then separately acylated with fluorescent carboxylic and sulfonic acids (I), condensed with aryl aldehydes (II), or directly ary- lated (III) via nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Carboxylic, sulfonic, and related acid derivatives are as follows: fluorescamine, acridine-9-carboxylic acid, 5-dimethylamino-naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, N, N′-diBoc-3-guanidino-naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, 3-amino-naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, 1-hydroxy-naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, 3-di-tert-butoxycarbonylmethylamino-naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, quinoline-2-carboxylic acid, quinoline-8-carboxylic acid, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine succinimidyl ester, and 1-(3-(succinimidyloxycarbonyl)benzyl)-4-(5-(4-methoxyphenyl) oxazol-2-yl) pyridinium bromide.

Aryl halides and related derivatives are as follows: NBD-Cl, 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitro-benzene, 6-chloro-5-nitro-quinoline, 2-chloro-5-trichloromethyl-nicotinonitrile, 2-bromo-pyrimidine, 2-bromo-4,6-bis-(4-chloro-phenyl)-pyrimidine, 4-chloro-3,5-dinitro-benzonitrile, 2-fluoro-5-nitro-benzoic acid, 5-fluoro-2,4-dinitro-phenylamine, 1-fluoro-4-nitro-2-trifluoromethyl-benzene, 4-chloro-2,8-bis-trifluoromethyl-quinoline, 4-chloro-2-phenyl-quinazoline, and 2-chloro-3,5-dinitro-pyridine. A description of the complete library of 417 compounds is available online as supplemental material. Radioactive assays were performed in duplicate at 30 °C. The final assay volume totaled 40 μl and contained 62.5 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 0.75 mm CaCl2, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 7.5 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 1.6 μg/ml diacylglycerol, and 10 ng of PKC. For the determination of the kinetic constants, the following concentrations were employed: 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (500–5000 cpm/pmol) and a substrate concentration that varied over a 10-fold range around the apparent Km. Phosphorylation reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μl of PKC from a stock solution (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.75 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) into 30 μl of assay buffer containing peptide substrate. Reactions were terminated after 5 min by spotting 25-μl aliquots onto phosphocellulose paper disks (2.1 cm in diameter). After 10 s, the disks were immersed in 10% glacial acetic acid and soaked with occasional stirring for at least 1 h. The acetic acid was decanted, and the disks were collectively washed with four volumes of 0.5% H3PO4, 1 volume of water followed by a final acetone rinse. The disks were air dried and then counted in a Beckman LS scintillation counter. Fluorescence assays were performed in triplicate at 30 °C and initiated by the addition of ATP to a 100-μl cuvette containing a 50-μl solution of PKC and peptide substrate 2. Final conditions are as follows: 62.5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.1 μg/ml diacylglycerol, 1 mm ATP, and 13 nm PKC. After the addition of ATP, the solution was gently mixed, and the time-dependent change in fluorescent intensity (excitation, 520 nm; emission, 560 nm) was continuously monitored with a Photon Technology QM-1 spectrofluorimeter. HeLa cells were synchronized for 16 h in the presence of 250 ng/ml nocodazole, and mitotic cells were collected by selective detachment. Nocodazole was removed prior to lysis by washing the cells two times with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mmNa2HPO4/7 H2O, 2.6 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl). The cells were then resuspended in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Pipes, pH 7.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1m glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin and a 1:100 dilution of phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 (microcystin LR, cantharidin, and (−)-p-bromotetramisole) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2 (sodium vanadate, sodium molybdate, sodium tartrate, and imidazole) (Sigma). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 16,000 × g, and the concentration of the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The supernatant was diluted with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithithreitol, 10 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures 1 and 2 as described above) to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml. The PKC assay was initiated via the addition of 10 μl of HeLa mitotic lysate to a cuvette containing a preincubated (30 °C) 110-μl assay solution containing (final concentration) 10 μm peptide 2, 10 mm ATP, 750 μm CaCl2, 12.5 mmMgCl2, 500 μm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 7.5 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 1.6 μg/ml diacylglycerol in 20 mm Tris at pH 7.5. The time-dependent change in fluorescent intensity (excitation, 520 nm; emission, 560 nm) was continuously monitored with a Photon Technology QM-1 spectrofluorimeter. The conventional PKCs α, β, and γ were immunodepleted from the HeLa cell lysate via (i) preclearance with protein A-Sepharose, (ii) incubation with the monoclonal cPKC antibody PKC(MC5) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), (iii) addition of protein A-Sepharose and subsequent centrifugation, and (iv) repetition of steps iii and iv. Protein A-Sepharose was used for mock immunodepleted lysates. The absence of PKCs α, β, and γ was confirmed by Western blot analysis using antibodies targeted against the individual isoforms (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Subconfluent, serum-starved (24 h), HeLa cells were cultured on 22-mm coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The NBD-containing peptide 2 (200 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, was prefiltered through a 0.22-μm filter. Microinjections were performed with an Eppendorf (Brinkman Instruments, Westbury, NY) 5246 microinjection apparatus mounted on the microscope inside the environmental chamber. We estimate a 10-fold dilution of the peptide upon microinjection from the equation for volume (V) flow through a capillary tube as shown in Eq.1. Vt=πpr48lηEquation 1 where p is the difference in pressure at the ends of the tube (290 hPa), r is the radius (0.05 μm), l is the length (10 μm) of the tube, η is the viscosity of the injected solution (0.69 × 10−2 g/cm-sec), and t is the total injection time (0.3 s). The average volume of a fibroblast was taken as 2 picoliters (18.Kislauski E.H. Zhu X.-C. Singer R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). TPA (1 μm) was added to the media following microinjection to stimulate PKC activity. Time-lapse images were collected with 2 × 2 binning using a Photometrics (Tuscon, Az) Sensys cooled CCD camera mounted on an Olympus IX 70 inverted microscope (Melville, NY) with a PlanApo 40X N. A. 0.75 objective Ludl shutters (Hawthorne, NY) and a filter set with an excitation wavelength of 460–500 nm and an emission wavelength of 510–560 nm. Images were collected at 30-s intervals (300-ms exposure time). Fluorescence intensity measurements were corrected using values from a standard photobleaching curve generated from control experiments with microinjected HeLa cells that had not been treated with TPA. Analysis of cell intensities over time was conducted using I. P. Lab and Microsoft Excel (Redmond, OR). For experiments with the PKC inhibitor, the bisindolylmaleimide derivative GF 109203X (20 μmestimated intracellular concentration) was microinjected along with the NBD-peptide 2. The design of a fluorescent sensor of protein kinase activity requires a substrate that contains a fluorophore positioned either near the site of phosphorylation or at a more remote site that responds to phosphorylation via a conformational change. We have shown previously that, in addition to Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues, protein kinases will catalyze the phosphorylation of a wide variety of unnatural amino acid analogs in active site-directed peptides (19.Lee T.R. Niu J. Lawrence D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5375-5380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20.Kwon Y.-G. Mendelow M. Lawrence D.S. J. Biol.

Niu J. Lawrence D.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4245-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The synthesis of these substrates is abetted by the fact that protein kinases phosphorylate alcohol-containing residues attached to the C and/or N terminus of appropriately designed peptides. Consequently, a wide variety of Ser analogs can be easily prepared and incorporated into the peptide substrate. For example, the peptide Ser-Phe-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-amide contains an N-terminal serine moiety that can be readily substituted with a virtually unlimited array of functional groups. Indeed, numerous N-substituted analogs of this peptide serve as highly efficient substrates for the α, β, and γ isoforms of PKC (24.Yan X. Curley K. Lawrence D.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We reasoned that a peptide of the general structure fluorophore-Ser-Phe-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-amide would also function as an effective PKC substrate. The single compact fluorophore-serine residue contains a fluorescent reporter that is confined to within a few angstroms of the hydroxyl moiety, the site of imminent phosphorylation. Consequently, phosphorylation of the serine alcohol could exert a dramatic affect on the photophysical properties of the adjacent fluorophore. The peptide H2N-Ser-Phe-Arg-Arg-Arg-Arg-Lys-amide (1) was prepared using an Fmoc-based protocol, spatially segregated, and the free N-terminal amine was subsequently modified with an array of fluorophore-containing carboxylic acids (I), aromatic aldehydes (II), and electron-deficient aryl halides (III). The imines generated in II were also reduced to the corresponding secondary amines IV (NaCNBH3) and transformed via aromatic nucleophilic substitution to a variety of tertiary amines V (Scheme I). This spatially segregated fluorophore-substituted peptide-based library contains a total of 417 distinct chemical entities and was screened for changes in fluorescence intensity in the presence of PKC and ATP under activating conditions (the structures of all 417 members of this library are provided in online supplemental material). Interestingly, the overwhelming majority (414) of these peptide-linked fluorophores displayed little (<10%) or no fluorescence change upon exposure to PKC. The obvious explanation is that phosphorylation of the peptide fails to induce the desired change in photophysical properties of the appended fluorophore. However, it is also possible that the introduction of fluorophores, at various sites along the peptide framework, interferes with PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation. We viewed the latter possibility as unlikely, particularly for simple N-monosubstituted peptides since we found previously that PKC will phosphorylate peptides containing a wide variety of structurally diverse functionality attached at and/or near the phosphorylatable serine moiety (24.Yan X. Curley K. Lawrence D.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we evaluated in-depth a few representative members of the library (Table I). The NBD derivative 2 displays the greatest change in fluorescence intensity. By contrast, the dansyl and acridine derivatives exhibit phosphorylation-induced changes in fluorescence that are an order of magnitude less than that of NBD. The corresponding fluorescamine-treated peptide displays no fluorescence change as does the naphthalene-2,3-dicarbaldehyde/cyanide-treated species. Is the poor fluorescence response to PKC/ATP due to the fact that these peptides serve as poor PKC substrates? We addressed this question by obtaining the PKCα-catalyzed Km and Vmax values using the [γ-32P]ATP radioactive method (25.Glass D.B. Masaracchia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). As is clear from Table I, all five peptides are reasonably effective substrates for PKCα.Table IPKCα-catalyzed phosphorylation of selected library membersFluorescence enhancement upon phosphorylation (% Change) was obtained by spectrofluorimetry, and Km and kcat values were acquired using the standard [γ-32P]ATP radioactive assay (25.Glass D.B.

Masaracchia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The NBD-substituted peptide was subsequently examined in greater detail. The C-terminal-positioned Lys moiety allowed us to compare fluorescence changes in response to phosphorylation as a function of NBD position (peptides 2 and 3; Scheme II) relative to the serine moiety. We initially assessed the efficacy of 2 and 3 as PKC substrates using the radioactive ATP assay (25.Glass D.B. Masaracchia R.A. Feramisco J.R. Kemp B.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Both peptides serve as efficient substrates for pure recombinant PKCα, β, and γ with Km and kcat values similar to other PKC peptide substrates (Table II).Table IIKinetic constants associated with the phosphorylation of peptides2 and 3 by recombinant human PKCs α, β, and γSubstrateAssayKinetic constantsPKCαPKCβPKCγKm(μm)9.0 ± 1.09.2 ± 0.45.0 ± 1.0NBD-SFR4K (2)Radioactivekcat(min−1)380 ± 20180 ± 10210 ± 20kcat/Km(min−1 μM−1)42 ± 523 ± 242 ± 9Km (μm)29 ± 327 ± 430 ± 5Fluorescencekcat(min−1)170 ± 3094 ± 9190 ± 40kcat/Km(min−1 μM−1)5.9 ± 13.5 ± 0.66.3 ± 1.7Km(μm)19 ± 1SFR4K(ε-NBD) (3)Radioactivekcat(min−1)210 ± 10Not determinedNot determinedkcat/Km(min−1 μm−1)11 ± 1Km (μm)Fluorescencekcat(min−1)No Fluorescence Intensity Changekcat/Km(min−1 μm−1) Open table in a new tab The excitation and emission spectra of peptide 2 and its phosphorylated counterpart are furnished in Fig. 1. The most dramatic difference in the excitation spectra of the substrate and phosphorylated product is observed in the long wavelength region. Excitation of both NBD-peptide2 and the corresponding phosphorylated derivative at 460 nm (λmax) furnished a greater than 2-fold emission enhancement (>100%) in favor of the phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 1B). In addition, we found that excitation at a longer wavelength (520 nm) produced an even larger (2.5-fold) relative enhancement in the emission intensity of the NBD fluorophore bound to the phosphorylated peptide. By contrast, we failed to detect any change in fluorescence intensity following phosphorylation of peptide3. The kcat and Kmvalues determined via spectrofluorometry are modestly different from those acquired by the corresponding radioactive method (Table II). These differences may reflect the slightly different conditions used in these assays, which were optimized to enhance fluorescence intensity changes (spectrofluorometric assay) or kcat/Km (radioactive assay). We note that the variance between the kinetic constants generated by these two different assays is small and that, using either assay, peptide 2 exhibits favorable properties as a PKC substrate for the α, β, and γ isoforms. Several laboratories have reported the up-regulation of PKC activity during mitosis (26.Goss V.L. Hocevar B.A. Thompson L.J. Stratton C.A. Burns D.J. Fields A.P. J. Biol.

Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently shown that PKC mediates the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin II during mitosis (30.Varlamova O. Spektor A. Bresnick A.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Consequently, we examined the ability of peptide2 to report PKC activity in mitotic lysates from HeLa cells. Crude mitotic cell extracts were prepared as described previously (30.Varlamova O. Spektor A. Bresnick A.R. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and the PKC assay was initiated via addition of the cell lysate to an assay buffer containing 2. As shown in Fig. 2, a linear increase in fluorescence intensity is observed in the first 10 min following the addition of the cell lysate, which plateaus at ∼1.7-fold above background. The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine blocks the increase in fluorescence intensity observed upon mitotic cell lysate addition. Staurosporine (31.Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 181-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), like many protein kinase inhibitors (32.Lingameneni R. Vysotskaya N. Duch D.S. Hemmings Jr., H.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 33.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 351: 95-105Crossref Google Scholar), targets a variety of protein kinases. Consequently, from these experiments, it is not clear whether the staurosporine-induced block of fluorescence is due to the inhibition of PKC activity or the inhibition of other protein kinases that also catalyze the phosphorylation of peptide 2. We addressed whether the peptide substrate 2 is selective for the conventional PKCs by immunodepleting the mitotic cell lysates of PKCs α, β, and γ using a commercially available antibody that recognizes all three PKC isoforms. Depletion of the individual α, β, and γ isoforms from the cell lysate was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using isoform-specific antibodies (shown for PKCα in Fig. 3). Analogous Western blots were performed for the β and γ PKC isoforms as well (data not shown). The immunodepleted lysate (Fig. 3, lane 3) was examined for PKC activity in the fluorescence assay. We did not detect any change in fluorescence intensity over the course of 1 h (Fig. 2, plot D). The latter observation is consistent with the notion that the fluorescence enhancement observed with crude mitotic lysates is due to PKC. It is unlikely that a protein kinase downstream from PKC is responsible for the observed enhancement in fluorescence since this putative downstream kinase would have already been activated in the cell lysate prior to immunodepletion of the conventional PKCs. Given the enzymological and photophysical behavior displayed by peptide2, we examined the in vivo visualization of PKC activity in live cells. Serum-starved HeLa cells were microinjected with the NBD-modified peptide, and the cells were subsequently exposed to TPA, a tumor-promoting phorbol ester that potently and specifically activates PKC (34.Gschwendt M. Kittstein W. Marks F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A change in fluorescence intensity is evident within 4 min of TPA exposure and significantly so by 8 min (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 serves as a link to a video file that is available online. In this video, four cells that have been microinjected with peptide 2 are shown responding in a fluorescently sensitive fashion to the TPA stimulus. A comparison of the curves generated in the lysate (Fig. 2) and live cell (Fig. 5) assays demonstrate that both curves display an essentially linear increase in fluorescence intensity within the first 10 min of exposure to activated PKC followed by a plateau phase shortly thereafter. The overall enhancement in fluorescence intensity displayed by peptide 2 in living cells is 2-fold, whereas the cell lysate-based experiments furnish an overall 1.7-fold increase in fluorescence. In an additional series of experiments, the NBD-peptide PKC substrate was co-injected with the known PKC inhibitor, GF 109203X (35.Goekjian P.G. Jirousek M.R. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 877-903PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibitor effectively blocks the TPA-induced enhancement in cellular fluorescence. Although the Ki value for GF 109203X is in the low nanomolar range, micromolar concentrations of GF 109203X were used to block in vivo PKC activity due to the presence of high intracellular levels of ATP.Figure 5TPA-induced time-dependent change in fluorescence intensity in HeLa cells containing the microinjected peptide 2 (A) and the microinjected peptide 2 in the presence of 20 μm GF 109203X (B).

A library of fluorescently labeled PKC peptide substrates was prepared. The lead derivative displays a phosphorylation-induced fluorescence change that allows the visualization of real time PKC activity in both cell lysates and living cells. Furthermore, immunodepletion experiments suggest that the fluorescently tagged peptide is selectively, if not exclusively, phosphorylated by the conventional PKCs. The PKC biosensor strategy outlined herein takes advantage of the ease with which peptides can be modified to create libraries of structurally altered analogs. However, the inherent synthetic mutability of peptides is not just limited to library construction. For example, it may be possible to simultaneously monitor more than one protein kinase by affixing fluorophores with distinct photophysical properties to the N or C termini of appropriately designed active site-directed peptides. Furthermore, there exists the potential for temporal and spatial control over when and where the substrate is phosphorylated via the preparation of “caged” analogs (11.Wood J. Koszelak M. Liu J.

It is the most intensely studied member of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily and serves as a model for understanding the structure and function of related ion conducting channels including glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid type A, γ-aminobutyric acid type C, and type 3 serotonin receptors. nAChRs are pentameric complexes that assemble in the membrane with 5-fold symmetry. Each subunit contains an N-terminal extracellular domain about 200 amino acids long followed by four membrane-spanning segments (M1–M4) with an intracellular loop of variable length between M3 and M4. The second transmembrane region from each subunit contributes to the formation of the wall lining the channel pore. In muscle and Torpedo electric organ, the subunit composition is (α1)2βγδ and (α1)2βεδ in embryonic and adult tissue, respectively (for review, see Ref. 1.Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1331-1344Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Neuronal nAChR subunits (α2-α10 and β2-β4) apparently can assemble in various combinations giving rise to multiple receptor subtypes. In heterologous expression systems, particular subunit combinations form functional hetero-pentamers (e.g.(α4)2(β2)3) whereas the α7-α9 subunits form functional homo-pentamers (2.Sargent P. Annu.

Academic Press, New York1993: 65-128Google Scholar). Short chain neurotoxins have 60–62 amino acids. Long chain toxins have 66–74 amino acids and a fifth disulfide at the tip of the second loop. Solution NMR and x-ray crystallographic studies (e.g. Refs. 6.Zinn-Justin S. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Bontems F. Ménez A. Toma F.

An NMR dynamics study of a short α-neurotoxin reveals “disorder” at the tips of fingers I and II reflecting localized mobility on the picosecond to nanosecond time scales (9.Connolly P.J. Stern A.S. Hoch J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The significance of this mobility is highlighted by evidence that mutation of residues at these locations in other related toxins produces large effects on binding (11.Trémeau O. Lemaire C.

The three-dimensional structure of Bgtx, determined by x-ray crystallography (12.Love R.A. Stroud R.M. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), differed from solution and x-ray structures of related short and long toxins particularly in the length of the highly conserved central β-sheet in finger II (6.Zinn-Justin S. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Bontems F. Ménez A. Toma F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11335-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7.Leroy E. Mikou A. Yang Y. Guittet E. J. Biomol. Struct.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21530-21536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, an NMR-based investigation of the secondary structure in Bgtx indicated that the structure of Bgtx in solution most likely resembles that of other α-neurotoxins (13.Basus V.J. Billeter M. Love R.A. Stroud R.M. Kuntz I.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2763-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although this study paved the way to a better understanding of the solution structure of Bgtx, an adequately high resolution structure of Bgtx has not been available until now. The high resolution three-dimensional structure of unbound Bgtx presented here greatly facilitates the investigation of conformational changes that Bgtx undergoes as it binds nAChR-derived and engineered sequences, the subject of recent structural studies (14.Basus V.J.

Sussman J.L. Fuchs S. Neuron. 2001; 32: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Photolabeling and mutagenesis studies indicate that the ligand-binding site on the nAChR is formed at subunit interfaces in the N-terminal extracellular region of the receptor (1.Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1331-1344Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The major structural determinants of ligand binding are found on the α subunit with additional contributions made by residues of adjoining subunits. Strongly conserved residues from three discontinuous regions of the α subunit (designated loops A–C) contribute to the binding pocket. In the crystal structure of the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), a snail homologue of the extracellular domain of a homo-pentameric nAChR, loops A–C contribute to a relatively hydrophobic cavity at the subunit interface (21.Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Earlier studies (22.Wilson P.T. Lentz T.L. Hawrot E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8790-8794Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have shown that the major determinants of Bgtx binding lie between positions 173 and 204 on the α1 subunit, coincident with loop C. This region includes the highly conserved aromatic residues Tyr190 and Tyr198and, in addition, Cys192 and Cys193 (in α1 numbering) which form an uncommon disulfide. Synthetic peptide binding studies have suggested that the Bgtx-binding site on the α7 subunit is in the homologous region (α7 178–196) (23.McLane K.E. Wu X. Schoepfer R. Lindstrom J.M. Conti-Tronconi B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15230-15239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of this region in toxin binding was further highlighted by the observation that six residues from this region of α7 could confer Bgtx sensitivity when placed into the corresponding positions of the Bgtx-insensitive α3 subunit (24.Levandoski M.M. Lin Y. Moise L. McLaughlin J.T. Cooper E. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26113-26119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Additionally, mutation of loop C residues, Tyr187 and Tyr194 of α7, to Phe reduced Bgtx blockade of ACh-evoked currents in heterologously expressed receptors (25.Galzi J.-L. Bertrand D. Devillers-Thiéry A. Revah F. Bertrand S. Changeux J.P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 294: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This is consistent with a 60-fold reduction in Bgtx binding observed in synthetic peptides where Tyr190of α1 (which corresponds to Tyr187 of α7) was mutated to Phe, showing the important role of Tyr190 in binding Bgtx (26.Pearce S.F.A. Preston-Hurlburt P. Hawrot E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported NMR solution structures for two α1 subunit-derived peptides, an α12-mer (α185–196) and an α18-mer (α181–198), in complex with Bgtx (14.Basus V.J. Song G. Hawrot E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12290-12298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15.Gentile L.N. Basus V.J. Shi Q.-L. Hawrot E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Chem. 2001; 276: 22930-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we extend our analysis of the Bgtx-binding site to the corresponding 19-amino acid segment on the neuronal nAChR α7 subunit (α7 178–196) with an original solution NMR structure of the α7 19-mer in complex with Bgtx. Our primary goals are to determine an energetically favorable conformation for a region of the neuronal nAChR important in agonist and antagonist binding and to understand the structural basis for the strong interaction between Bgtx and the α7 nAChR. In addition, we present a new high resolution analysis of the secondary structure-rich core of Bgtx, significantly extending the initial NMR structural studies of this toxin (13.Basus V.J. Billeter M. Love R.A. Stroud R.M. Kuntz I.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2763-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We prepared a synthetic gene encoding residues 178–196 (IPGKRTESFYECCKEPYPD) of the chick neuronal nAChR α7 subunit (27.Courtier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.M. Hernandez M.C. Bertrand S. Millar N. Valera S. Barkas T. Ballivet M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) using mutually priming oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were designed according to the specifications of the pET-31 Peptide Expression System (Novagen) with 3′ overhangs encoding methionine (28.Kuliopulos A. Walsh C.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4599-4607Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The sequences of the two oligonucleotides are 5′-ATTCCGGGCAAACGTACCGAAAGCTTCTATGAATGCTGCAAAGAACCGTATCCGGATATG-3′ and 5′-ATCCGGATACGGTTCTTTGCAGCATTCATAGAAGCTTTCGGTACGTTTGCCCGGAATCAT-3′. Two copies of this expression cassette were ligated in tandem into pET-31b(+), and the construct was authenticated by DNA sequencing in the forward and reverse directions. The α7 19-mer was expressed as a ketosteroid isomerase fusion protein with a C-terminal polyhistidine tag in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen). Isotopically labeled α7 19-mer was produced in E. coli using M9 minimal medium with (15NH4)2SO4 and 13C6-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as the sole sources of nitrogen and carbon, respectively (29.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.3Google Scholar). The medium was supplemented with vitamins according to Ref. 30.Venters R.A. Farmer B.T. Fierke C.A. Spicer L.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1101-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar. Detailed methods for expression and purification of the α7 19-mer have been reported previously (16.Zeng H. Moise L. Grant M.A. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22930-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) for a similar nAChR recombinant peptide. Briefly, ketosteroid isomerase-α7 19-mer fusion protein was isolated from resolubilized inclusion bodies by nickel affinity chromatography. The fusion protein was then treated with CNBr and the reaction products separated by RP-HPLC. α7 19-mer was isocratically eluted from a semi-preparative C18RP-HPLC column (Vydac) at 5 ml/min in 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectrometric analysis of HPLC fractions identified purified α7 19-mer (HHMI Biopolymer/Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University School of Medicine). The redox status of the adjacent cysteine residues, Cys189–Cys190, was determined by RP-HPLC analysis of N-ethylmaleimide-treated α7 19-mer in its condition after purification and following pretreatment with dithiothreitol. Typical yields of isotopically labeled α7 19-mer were 2–4 mg/liter. Purified peptide was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. The KD value for the α7 19-mer-Bgtx interaction was determined by measurement of inhibition of the initial rate of Bgtx binding to nAChR-enriched Torpedo membranes following preincubation of Bgtx with α7 19-mer (26.Pearce S.F.A. Preston-Hurlburt P. Hawrot E. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1990; 241: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). 125I-Labeled Bgtx (2.5 nm) was incubated over a wide range of concentrations of α7 19-mer in 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 30 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, for 18 h at room temperature. 100 μl of the peptide/toxin mixture was added to microtiter plate wells coated with 2 μg of Torpedo membranes that were pre-blocked with 200 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Following a 5-min incubation, the binding reaction was aspirated, and wells were washed 4 times with 200 μl of 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 30 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Torpedo membrane-bound 125I-Bgtx was measured in a γ counter. All measurements were done in triplicate. The effect of pH was also assessed by preparing samples in 30 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, to replicate the buffer conditions of the NMR sample (see below). Hydrated Bgtx (Sigma) was used to resuspend the α7 19-mer in order to facilitate formation of a 1:1 peptide-toxin complex. Uniformly 15N-labeled and uniformly15N,13C-double-labeled α7 19-mer·Bgtx samples were prepared at a concentration of 1.5–2.0 mm. These samples contained 30 mm sodium phosphate and 50 μm sodium azide in 95% H2O, 5% D2O at pH 5.5. Sodium 3-trimethylsilylpropionate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was added at 50 μm as an internal calibration standard. For deuterium exchange experiments, the complex was lyophilized and reconstituted in 99.9% D2O at pH 5.5 (isotope effect unaccounted). Preparation of the free Bgtx samples was described previously (13.Basus V.J. Billeter M. Love R.A. Stroud R.M. Kuntz I.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2763-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). NMR experiments were carried out at1H frequencies of 400 and 600 MHz on Bruker Avance spectrometers at Brown University and at 500 MHz on a GE spectrometer equipped either with a GN console with a Nicolet computer or an Omega console with a Sun 3/160 computer at the University of California, San Francisco. For free Bgtx, the following spectra in H2O were acquired at 15, 25, and 35 °C, and pH 5.79: DQF-COSY (31.Rance M. Sørensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar), TOCSY (70 ms MLEV-17 spin-lock sequence) (32.Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3104) Google Scholar), and NOESY spectra (160-ms mixing time) (33.Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4828) Google Scholar) using the water suppression scheme described in Basus (34.Basus V.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 60: 138-142Google Scholar). No significant shifts in free Bgtx proton resonances were observed between samples at pH 5.5 and 5.79, suggesting that the chemical environment is comparable at both pH conditions. In addition, NOESY (160-ms mixing time) and E-COSY spectra (35.Griesinger C. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 6394-6396Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar) at 25 and 35 °C in D2O were acquired. Distance restraints were calculated from experimental NOESY intensities using the program MARDIGRAS version 2.0 (36.Borgias B.A. James T.L. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 176: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 37.Borgias B.A. James T.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 87: 475-487Google Scholar) which uses the complete relaxation matrix to produce an upper and lower distance bound for each experimental intensity. To make use of this procedure that determines accurate distances from the integrated intensities of the NOESY cross-peaks, a value for the rotational correlation time, τc, must be defined. For free Bgtx the correlation time was determined by measurement of the 13C T1 and T2relaxation times at natural abundance, using a sample dissolved in 99.96% D2O. These experiments were carried out using a double-DEPT technique with proton detection for maximum sensitivity. For T1, we used the double-DEPT sequence with inversion recovery (38.Sklenár V. Torchia D. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 73: 375-379Google Scholar), and for T2, we used the double-DEPT sequence with a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill modification using a series of 180° pulses with a repetition rate of 1 ms to replace the single 180° refocusing pulse in the sequence of Nirmala and Wagner (39.Nirmala N.R. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 82: 659-661Google Scholar). The sum of the resonances at different portions of the spectra was used to determine the relaxation times. The data were analyzed by fitting to a single exponential decay function. Peak volumes from D2O and H2O NOESY spectra were obtained by fitting the peak or peaks to be integrated to a Gaussian line shape in Sparky. In the case of peaks with low signal to noise ratio, the points within a manually selected rectangular or elliptical area surrounding the cross-peak were summed using Sparky (40.Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2001Google Scholar). In NOESY spectra the 3 JHNα coupling constants were determined by line fitting as described above, using Sparky. These values were used as the minimum values, because the apparent coupling constant in NOESY spectra will be smaller than the actual coupling constant. In DQF-COSY spectra, coupling constants were determined by line fitting the antiphase multiplets, followed by measurement of the separation between the simulated anti-phase multiplets (35.Griesinger C. Sørensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 6394-6396Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These values were used as maximum values, because the apparent coupling in DQF-COSY spectra is larger than the actual coupling constant due to the summation of anti-phase cross-peaks. Exchange rates were measured at 25 °C for Bgtx lyophilized from H2O and re-dissolved in D2O. Immediately following this procedure, the sample was placed in the spectrometer, and one-dimensional and TOCSY spectra (40 ms mixing time) were alternately acquired. The first one-dimensional spectrum was acquired 14 min after dissolving the lyophilized powder in D2O, and the first TOCSY spectrum was started 1 min later. Several spectra were obtained up to 36 h after starting the exchange, and further spectra were obtained 1 and 2 weeks later with the sample maintained at 25 °C. The cross-peaks in the resulting spectra were integrated, and cross-peaks between α- and β-protons were integrated for use as intensity references to eliminate variations of the spectrometer conditions after the sample was removed and re-inserted in the magnet for the last time points. For the α7 19-mer·Bgtx complex, 1H-15N three-dimensional NOESY-HSQC (120-ms mixing time) (41.Marion D. Driscoll P.C. Kay L.E. Wingfield P.T. Bax A. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M.

Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1048) Google Scholar) experiments were collected at 35 °C using a uniformly15N-labeled α7 19-mer·Bgtx sample in order to assign resonances. To clarify ambiguities in the assignments, an HNCA experiment (43.Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 432-440Google Scholar) was performed using uniformly15N/13C double-labeled α7 19-mer.1H homonuclear NOESY (120-ms mixing time) (33.Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4828) Google Scholar) and TOCSY (60-ms MLEV-17 spin-lock sequence) (32.Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3104) Google Scholar) experiments were performed with15N decoupling to assign bound Bgtx resonances. NOESY and TOCSY experiments were performed at 15, 25, and 35 °C and with different mixing times to resolve ambiguities and facilitate the assignment process. Water was suppressed using the WATERGATE method, incorporating a 3-9-19 refocusing pulse sequence with pulsed field gradients (44.Sklenár V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Deuterium exchange was performed to identify slowly exchanging amide protons involved in secondary structure. Following a two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC (45.Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2417) Google Scholar), five (sequential) homonuclear TOCSY spectra were collected over 16 h following reconstitution of the α7 19-mer·Bgtx complex in D2O. The stoichiometry of the α7 19-mer·Bgtx complex was determined in a mole ratio titration of the α7 19-mer using two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC experiments. NMR data were processed by XWIN-NMR (Bruker) or NMRPipe (46.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11450) Google Scholar), and resonance assignments were made in Sparky (40.Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2001Google Scholar). 1H chemical shifts were referenced to sodium 3-trimethylsilylpropionate (0.0 ppm). The1H, 15N, and 13C assignments will be deposited in the BioMagResBank chemical shift data base. For free Bgtx, distance geometry calculations were performed on the Cray Y-MP at the San Diego Supercomputer Center using the distance geometry program VEMBED (47.Kuntz I.D. Thomason J.F. Oshiro C.M.

Computer modeling of human IL-18 identified two charged residues, Glu-42 and Lys-89, which interact with oppositely charged amino acid residues buried in a large hydrophobic pocket of IL-18BP. The cell surface IL-18 receptor α chain competes with IL-18BP for IL-18 binding, although the IL-18 receptor α chain does not share significant homology to IL-18BP. In the present study, Glu-42 was mutated to Lys and Lys-89 to Glu; Glu-42 and Lys-89 were also deleted separately. The deletion mutants (E42X and K89X) were devoid of biological activity, and the K89E mutant lost 95% of its activity. In contrast, compared with wild-type (WT) IL-18, the E42K mutant exhibited a 2-fold increase in biological activity and required a 4-fold greater concentration of IL-18BP for neutralization. The binding of WT IL-18 and its various mutants to human natural killer cells was evaluated by competition assays. The mutant E42K was more effective than WT IL-18 in inhibiting the binding of 125I-IL-18 to natural killer cells, whereas the three inactive mutants E42X, K89E, and K89X were unable to compete with 125I-IL-18 for binding. Similarly, WT IL-18 and the E42K mutant induced degradation of Iκ-Bα, whereas the three biologically inactive mutants did not induce degradation. The present study reveals that Glu-42 and Lys-89 are critical amino acid residues for the integrity of IL-18 structure and are important for binding to cell surface receptors, for signal transduction, and for neutralization by IL-18BP.

Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 591Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Although the hallmark for IL-18 activity is the induction of Th1 cytokines, e.g. interferon-γ (IFNγ), IFNγ production by IL-18 requires co-stimuli, such as IL-2, IL-15, or more commonly IL-12. IL-12 enhances the induction of IFNγ by increasing the expression of both IL-18Rα and IL-18Rβ chains (5.Kim S.H. Reznikov L.L. Stuyt R.J. Selzman C.H. Fantuzzi G. Hoshino T. Young H.A. Dinarello C.A.

The IL-18 and IL-1 receptor chains share structural homology in their extracellular domains, which consist of three immunoglobulin-like repeats (9.Schreuder H. Tardif C. Trump-Kallmeyer S.

The IL-18Rβ chain was similarly identified by homology to the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (8.Born T.L. Thomassen E. Bird T.A. Sims J.E. J. Biol.

Of these, IL-1H4 binds to IL-18Rα chain (17.Pan G. Risser P. Mao W. Baldwin D.T. Zhong A.W. Filvaroff E. Yansura D. Lewis L. Eigenbrot C. Henzel W.J. Vandlen R. Cytokine. 2001; 13: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP) is a secreted protein that binds IL-18 and neutralizes its biological activities. IL-18BP has a single Ig domain but bears little homology to either chain of the IL-18R complex. It binds IL-18 with a high affinity (400 pm) and neutralizes the biological activity of IL-18 in vitro and in vivo (18.Novick D. Kim S.H. Fantuzzi G. Reznikov L.L. Dinarello C.A. Rubinstein M.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). IL-18BP is constitutively expressed in healthy subjects and circulates at plasma concentrations of 2–5 ng/ml (20.Novick D. Schwartsburd B. Pinkus R. Suissa D. Belzer I. Sthoeger Z. Keane W.F. Chvatchko Y. Kim S.H. Fantuzzi G. Dinarello C.A. Rubinstein M. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). IL-18BP is induced by IFNγ in various cells, suggesting that it serves as a negative feedback inhibitor of the Th1 immune response (21.Muhl H. Kampfer H. Bosmann M. Frank S. Radeke H. Pfeilschifter J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Viral homologues of IL-18BP are encoded by Molluscum contagiosum as well as other members of the Poxvirus family (18.Novick D. Kim S.H. Fantuzzi G. Reznikov L.L. Dinarello C.A. Rubinstein M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Viral IL-18BP was expressed and was shown to bind and neutralize human IL-18 (22.Xiang Y. Moss B. Virology. 1999; 257: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, skin infections of M. contagiosumexhibit a paucity of macrophages and T-cells despite a large number of infected epithelial cells, suggesting a natural viral defense against immune-mediated elimination by the host. The lack of sequence similarity between IL-18BP and the ligand-binding IL-18Rα chain is a challenge to identifying amino acid residues that are critical for binding of IL-18 and inhibiting its biological activity. Many cytokines have circulating soluble receptors constituting the ligand-binding extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor. These soluble receptors are produced either from receptor mRNA splice variants or by proteolytic cleavage of the cell surface receptor. Circulating soluble receptors exhibit lower affinity for their ligands compared with the cell surface receptors. In contrast, IL-18BP is not the counterpart of the cell surface IL-18Rα chain, and its affinity is comparable with the cell surface IL-18 receptor. 2K. Soo-Hyun, T. Azam, D. Novick, D.-Y. Yoon, L. L. Reznikov, P. Bufler, M. Rubinstein, and C. A. Dinarello, unpublished data. The molecular modeling of IL-18 and IL-18BP predicts regions of interaction having matching hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions on the two counterparts (19.Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L.

In the present study, we performed a mutational analysis to study the role of human IL-18 residues Glu-42 and Lys-89 in binding and biological activity. These amino acid residues were selected based on the molecular modeling. Glu-42 was mutated to Lys and Lys-89 to Glu. In addition, deletion mutants of these amino acids were studied. The functionality of the IL-18 mutants was assessed by induction of cytokines, induction of IκB degradation, competition for receptor binding using 125I-IL-18, and neutralization by IL-18BP. The results reveal the importance of Glu-42 and Lys-89 in IL-18 structure and function. RPMI 1640 culture medium was purchased from Invitrogen and supplemented with 10 mml-glutamine, 24 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Cellgro, Waukesha, WI). FBS was obtained from Invitrogen. IL-2 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human IL-12, IL-15, and TNF-α were gifts provided by PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Recombinant IL-18BP was a gift provided by Serono pharmaceutical research institute (SPRI, Geneva, CH). All restriction endonucleases and Taq DNA polymerase were purchased from Invitrogen. Talon affinity resin was obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) and used as recommended. For Western blot analysis, polyclonal rabbit anti-Iκ-Bα was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The secondary antibody, donkey anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugated antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA) and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Mature human IL-18 (10 μg) in borate buffer was radiolabeled with 125I Bolton-Hunter reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was stopped with excess glycine. Unbound125I was removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 equilibrated in PBS containing 0.25% gelatin and 0.02% sodium azide. Each fraction was counted, and the protein peak fractions were pooled. The pooled radiolabeled 125I-IL-18 contained ∼4.2 × 107 cpm/μg and was used for competition binding assays and for cell surface receptor cross-linking. Mutations were introduced into the human IL-18 precursor (proIL-18) cDNA by a two-step PCR. In addition, the caspase-1 cleavage site of proIL-18 was mutated into a Factor Xa site as described (23.Liu B. Novick D. Kim S.H. Rubinstein M. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotide primers were used: primer 1 (sense), 5′-ATATGAATTCATGGCTGCTGAACCAGTAG-3′; primer 2 (reverse), 5′-TAATTTAGATTTAAGCTTGCC-3′; primer 3 (sense), 5′-GGCAAGCTTAAATCTAAATTA-3′; primer 4 (reverse), 5′-ATATGGATCCTAGTCTTCGTTTTGAACAGTG-3′; primer 5 (sense), 5′-GGCAAGCTTTCTAAATTA-3′; primer 6 (sense), 5′-AGTATGTATGAAGATAGCCAG-3′; primer 7 (sense), 5′-AGTATGTATGATAGCCAG-3′. Primer 1 corresponds to the 5′ open reading frame of proIL-18 cDNA, extended at its 5′with an EcoRI site. Primer 2 contained a Glu-42 to Lys mutation. PCR with these primers provided the 5′half of the proIL-18 cDNA. The 3′ half of the proIL-18 cDNA was prepared by PCR with primers 3 and 4. Primer 3 contained the Glu-42 to Lys mutation, whereas primer 4 corresponded to the 3′ end of the proIL-18 cDNA, extended by a BamHI site. The two PCR products were purified by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel, and the bands were eluted using a gel extraction system (Invitrogen). These two cDNA segments were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and used as the template for the second-step PCR to generate a complete human IL-18 cDNA in which Glu-42 is mutated to Lys. The complete E42K proIL-18 cDNA was ligated into Bluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the EcoRI and BamHI (Invitrogen) restriction sites. The following mutants, Glu-42 to deletion (E42X), Lys-89 to Glu (K89E), and Lys-89 to deletion (K89X), were generated in the same manner using primers 5, 6, and 7, respectively, instead of primer 3. For Escherichia coli expression, each of the five IL-18 cDNA inserts was ligated into pPROEXTMHTa vector, which adds an His6 tag at the N terminus of proIL-18 (Invitrogen) using the EcoRI and XbaI sites. Each of the five pPROEXTMHTa/IL-18 plasmids was transformed into the competent E. coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) and expressed as described previously (23.Liu B. Novick D. Kim S.H. Rubinstein M. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An overnight culture (25 ml) was added to 450 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and was grown to a density of 0.6–1 A600. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropylthiogalactoside (0.3 mm), and incubation continued at 37 °C with shaking for 3 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C), and the pellet was suspended in 30 ml of Talon buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8). Cells were lysed by sonication (2 × 30-s bursts) on ice. The soluble protein was clarified by centrifugation (4,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and applied to a 2-ml mini-Talon column. The column was washed with 30 bed volumes of Talon buffer and eluted with 6 ml of 100 mm imidazole in Talon buffer. The elutant was dialyzed against Factor Xa buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2) at 4 °C for 20 h. Aliquot (0.2 ml) of the dialyzed protein was incubated with 4 μg of Factor Xa (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 4 h at room temperature in the presence of 2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Invitrogen). The mixture was dialyzed in Talon buffer and passed over a Talon column to remove the pro-piece and uncleaved proIL-18, yielding mature IL-18 mutants. Purity and quantitation of the products was determined by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and by staining with Coomassie Blue. The original NK92 cell line was derived from a patient and obtained as a kind gift from Dr. Hans Klingerman (Rush Medical Center, Chicago, IL). The human NK cell line used in the present studies was a subclone of the original cell line (24.Hoshino T. Winkler-Pickett R.T. Mason A.T. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 51-59PubMed Google Scholar). NK cells were maintained in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 50 pg/ml IL-2 and 200 pg/ml IL-15 (Peprotech). The KG-1 cell line was obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. For bioassays, NK and KG-1 cells were suspended at 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in the RPMI 1640 medium (0.2 ml) in 96 flat well plates in the presence of 0.5 ng/ml IL-12 or 10 ng/ml TNF-α, respectively. Different concentrations of IL-18 mutants were then added, and after 16–20 h at 37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2 the culture supernatants were collected for cytokine measurements. The liquid-phase electrochemiluminescence method was used to measure IFNγ (25.Puren A.J. Razeghi P. Fantuzzi G. Dinarello C.A. J. Infect.

Invest. 1998; 101: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) in cell culture supernatants. The electrochemiluminescence assay for IL-6 was developed using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies purchased from R&D Systems. The monoclonal anti-human IL-6 was biotinylated, and the affinity-purified goat anti-human IL-6 was labeled with ruthenium as previously described (26.Puren A.J. Fantuzzi G. Gu Y. Su M.S. Dinarello C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The amount of electrochemiluminescence was determined using an Origen Analyzer (Igen, Gaithersburg, MD). The limit of detection for IFNγ was 62 pg/ml, and the limit of detection for IL-6 and IL-8 was 40 pg/ml. KG-1 or NK cells (3 × 106cells) were individually stimulated with WT IL-18 or the different IL-18 mutants for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS. The cell pellets were suspended in 3× the packed cell volume in buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.4m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 2 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. The suspended cells were then subjected to three freeze and thaw cycles. Soluble protein was obtained by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). Each 20-μl sample protein was electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose paper, and incubated with rabbit antibody to Iκ-B (0.2 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG was added and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. 125I-IL-18 (2 × 106 cpm/50 ng) was incubated with 107 NK cells in the absence or presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled IL-18 for 1 h at 4 °C. For chemical cross-linking, disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) was added as described (18.Novick D. Kim S.H. Fantuzzi G. Reznikov L.L. Dinarello C.A. Rubinstein M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 127-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar) for 20 min. After chemical cross-linking, the cells were washed twice in PBS and then processed for extraction of membrane proteins. Briefly, 0.5 ml of PBS was added to the cell pellet then homogenized for ten bursts on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C. The membrane protein pellet was dissolved in sample buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. NK cells were suspended in a binding solution of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% FBS and 0.02% sodium azide at 1 × 106 cells/0.2 ml. The cells were incubated with 100 ng of unlabeled WT IL-18 or IL-18 mutants for 10 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, 125I-IL-18 (2 × 105 cpm/4.5 ng) was added for 20 min on ice. The cells were then washed twice with the binding solution, and bound radioactivity was determined in the cell pellet. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Group means were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Fisher's least significant difference. Statistical significance was accepted within 95% confidence limits. ANOVA and correlation analyses were performed with the statistical packages StatviewTM512+ (Brain Power, Inc., Calabasas, CA). The amino acid sequences of human and mouse IL-18 as well as the human IL-1H4 short variant (IL-1H4s) are shown in Fig. 1. The amino acid sequences of human and mouse IL-18 and human IL-1H4 short variant reveal a 16.8% identity. The short IL-1H4 mRNA spliced variant (17.Pan G. Risser P. Mao W. Baldwin D.T. Zhong A.W. Filvaroff E. Yansura D. Lewis L. Eigenbrot C. Henzel W.J. Vandlen R. Cytokine. 2001; 13: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) has a higher degree of alignment with the human IL-18 amino acid sequence than the long form splice variant of IL-1H4 (not shown). The ICE (caspase-1) cleavage site of IL-18 and a potential ICE cleavage site of IL-1H4 are underlined, respectively. Glu-42 and Lys-89 (shown in bold) are two amino acid residues predicted to be involved in the binding of human IL-18 to IL-18BP (19.Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These two amino acids are conserved between human IL-18 and human IL-1H4s. The Lys-89 residue is conserved in the mouse IL-18 as well (Fig. 1). These conserved residues were chosen for site-directed mutagenesis within human IL-18. We first generated the IL-18 precursor (proIL-18) and exchanged the ICE cleavage site for a Factor Xa site for the purpose of producing mature IL-18 mutants by Factor Xa cleavage (23.Liu B. Novick D. Kim S.H. Rubinstein M. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1519-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition to the WT proIL-18, a two-step PCR procedure was used to generate four proIL-18 mutants: Glu-42 to Lys (E42K), Glu-42 to deletion (E42X), Lys-89 to Glu (K89E), and Lys-89 to deletion (K89X). The proIL-18 mutant contained a His6 tag in its N terminus to facilitate affinity purification. Following expression in E. coli, each of the five proIL-18 recombinant proteins was soluble and could be purified using Talon affinity chromatography. The affinity-purified proIL-18 was first cleaved with Factor Xa, and then the N terminus His6tag pro-piece of IL-18 was removed by a second Talon affinity purification. The mature IL-18, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, revealed the 18-kDa mature IL-18 protein and its various point mutants (Fig. 2). WT IL-18 and its four mutants were tested for biological activity in NK and KG-1 cells by the ability to induce IFNγ and IL-6 in the presence of IL-12 or TNF-α, respectively (as co-stimulants), as well as IL-8 in the absence of any co-stimulant. WT IL-18 and E42K were active in both cell lines in all of the assays, whereas E42X and K89E mutants were inactive even at high concentrations. Interestingly, the E42K mutant was more potent than WT IL-18 (Fig. 3, A–D). The four mutants and WT IL-18 were then examined for the ability to be neutralized by increasing concentrations of IL-18BP. As shown in Fig. 4, E42K required a 4-fold greater concentration of IL-18BP compared with the amount of IL-18BP needed to neutralize the WT IL-18. This difference was observed at the sensitive segment of the IL-18BP dose-response (50% inhibition). We also observed this difference over the entire dose-response range of IL-18BP. For example, WT IL-18 at 40 ng/ml is completely neutralized by 28 ng/ml of IL-18BP, whereas the E42K mutant required 112 ng/ml (also a 4-fold difference). 125I-IL-18 was chemically cross-linked to NK cells in the presence or absence of the unlabeled WT IL-18. SDS-PAGE of the solubilized cell membranes revealed a cross-linked complex having an apparent molecular mass of 93 kDa. This band was not seen when cross-linking was performed in the presence of a 100-fold excess unlabeled WT IL-18 (Fig. 5A). The apparent molecular mass of the band corresponded to a 1:1 complex of IL-18 and IL-18Rα chain. A weaker band (>200 kDa) was seen as well, and it probably corresponds to the ternary complex of IL-18 and the two receptor chains. The results of the cross-linking of 125I-IL-18 provided a basis for competition assays of 125I-IL-18 binding with each of the four mutants on NK cells. The two biologically active forms of IL-18, WT IL-18 and E42K, specifically competed with125I-IL-18 for binding. In contrast, the three biologically inactive mutants did not affect the binding of 125I-IL-18 to the NK cells even when present in the same high molar excess as the unlabeled WT IL-18 and E42K (Fig. 5B). To further localize the effect of IL-18 mutations to the receptor-binding level, we tested the IL-18-induced degradation of Iκ-Bα in both KG-1 and NK cells. Following activation by either WT IL-18 or E42K phosphorylated Iκ-Bα was rapidly degraded in KG-1 and in NK cells as determined by immunoblotting with anti Iκ-Bα antibody (Fig. 6, A and B). In contrast, the IL-18 mutants E42X, K89E, and K89X, which are inactive in stimulating the production of IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-8, were unable to induce degradation of Iκ-Bα. Iκ-Bα appears as a double band (indicated by an arrow) representing two Iκ-Bα isoforms likely derived from mRNA splicing. The upper band of the doublet is degraded upon treatment of either cell type with biologically active forms of IL-18. The higher molecular mass band at ∼100 kDa is nonspecific and indicates that an equal amount of protein was present in each lane. The biological responses to IL-18 were initially focused on its ability to induce IFNγ and to act as a Th1 cytokine. However, recent studies have shown that IL-18 also contributes to the Th2 immune response (reviewed in Ref. 27.Nakanishi K. Yoshimoto T. Tsutsui H. Okamura H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 423-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). For example, IL-18 plays an important role in IgE synthesis (28.Hoshino T. Yagita H. Ortaldo J.R. Wiltrout R.H. Young H.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1998-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and induces IL-13 (24.Hoshino T. Winkler-Pickett R.T. Mason A.T. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 51-59PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, IL-18 exhibits inflammatory properties that are independent of induction of IFNγ (29.Joosten L.A. van de Loo F.A. Lubberts E. Helsen M.M. Netea M.G. van der Meer J.W. Dinarello C.A. van den Berg W.B. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6553-6558Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). IL-18 also participates in the pathological processes that follow ischemia re-oxygenation (30.Pomerantz B.J. Reznikov L.L. Harken A.H. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2871-2876Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Therefore, interest in IL-18 has broadened to include diverse biological functions. Hence, the present studies were intended to have a better understanding of ligand-receptor interactions for the response to IL-18. We introduced point mutations and deletions in IL-18 to identify amino acid residues involved in binding to the IL-18 receptor. Point mutations are useful in understanding and manipulating protein-protein interactions. For example, single point mutations in IL-1β, IL-5, or IL-6 have converted these molecules from being potent agonists to functional receptor antagonists (31.Ehlers M. de Hon F.D. Bos H.K. Horsten U.

Devos R. van der Heyden J. Guisez Y. Oefner C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5194-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the case of IL-18, molecular modeling of the IL-18/IL-18BP complex predicted two amino acid residues in IL-18 (Glu-42 and Lys-89) that are critical for binding to IL-18BP (19.Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We show here that mutations of these amino acid residues affect the biological activity of IL-18, as measured in two cell types, KG-1 and NK cells (Fig. 3, A–D). The importance of these two charged amino acid residues is also suggested by their conservation in human and mouse IL-18, as well as in human IL-1H4 (Fig. 1). IL-1H4, a homologue of IL-1, binds to the IL-18Rα chain (17.Pan G. Risser P. Mao W. Baldwin D.T. Zhong A.W. Filvaroff E. Yansura D. Lewis L. Eigenbrot C. Henzel W.J. Vandlen R. Cytokine. 2001; 13: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that exchanging Glu-42 or Lys-89 to Ala increased the biological activity of the resulting mutants severalfold (34.Kim S.H. Azam T. Yoon D.Y. Reznikov L.L. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that exchanging Glu-42 to Lys and Lys-89 to Glu or the deletion of either Glu-42 or Lys-89 resulted in distinctly different biological activities. The exchange of Lys-89 to Glu abolished IL-18 activities. The deletion of Glu-42 or Lys-89 resulted in nearly inactive molecules, suggesting the importance of these residues in binding to the IL-18 receptor. On the other hand, the exchange of Glu-42 to Lys enhanced biological activity compared with WT IL-18. The biological activities of the mutants were consistent using two cell lines for the induction of IL-8, IL-6, and IFNγ. Moreover, the induction of IFNγ by the mutants was also consistent using primary cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (data not shown). The present data suggest that these point mutations resulted in significant structural changes affecting the affinity of IL-18 for the IL-18Rα chain. The amino acids Glu-42 and Lys-89 of IL-18 were initially identified by molecular modeling as putative binding sites for IL-18BP (19.Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, IL-18BP does not share significant homology to the IL-18Rα chain (15.1%). In fact, the third domain of IL-1RI and IL-18Rα share a greater identity (20.7%), and both consist of three Ig-like domains. In contrast, there is only one Ig-like domain in IL-18BP (19.Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although there are differences in primary amino acid sequences of IL-18BP and IL-18Rα, the mutants suggest that IL-18Rα chain and IL-18BP likely share a three-dimensional similarity. Mutant E42K exhibits enhanced biological activity as well as increased resistance to neutralization by IL-18BP (Fig. 4). In fact, the Glu-42 to Lys mutant was 4-fold less sensitive to neutralization by IL-18BP as compared with WT IL-18. These data indicate that Glu-42 and Lys-89 in IL-18 are critical for binding to both IL-18Rα and IL-18BP. The binding of IL-1H4 to IL-18Rα may also include similar binding sites because the Glu-42 and Lys-89 are conserved amino acid residues present in IL-1H4 (Fig. 1). Although IL-1H4 binds to IL-18Rα chain (17.Pan G. Risser P. Mao W. Baldwin D.T. Zhong A.W. Filvaroff E. Yansura D. Lewis L. Eigenbrot C. Henzel W.J. Vandlen R. Cytokine. 2001; 13: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), to date there are no reports of an activity for IL-1H4. We have also demonstrated that the inactive mutants failed to compete with 125I-IL-18 for binding to receptors on NK cells, thereby identifying those amino acid residues needed for binding to the IL-18 cell surface receptors (Fig. 5B). The biological activities of cytokines usually correlate with the receptor binding affinities of the ligands; however, exceptions exist. For example, the human IL-18BP isoform c, which has an affinity for IL-18 of ∼10-fold less than for human IL-18BP isoform a, exhibits a similar ability to neutralize IL-18 (19.Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In the case of IL-1 mutants, receptor affinities are either unchanged or modestly lower, but the biological activities are decreased 100-fold (35.Evans R.J. Bray J. Childs J.D. Vigers G.P.

IL-18 induces the activation of several transcription factors: NFκ-B, STAT3, and AP-1 following the cascade of kinases MYD88, IRAK, and TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF-6) (36.Kalina U.

We observed a consistent difference between biologically active (WT IL-18 and E42K) and inactive (E42X, K89E, and K89X) IL-18 mutants and the degradation of Iκ-Bα. Thus, we conclude that IL-18-dependent Iκ-Bα degradation in KG-1 and NK cells fails to release NFκ-B for nuclear translocation, which results in the induction of IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-8 in either KG-1 or NK. It is unlikely, however, that the IL-18 point mutations described in this paper are receptor antagonists since they were unable to prevent the binding of 125I-IL-18 to NK cells even at 20-fold molar excess.

To understand the role of E2F-1 in the epidermis, we screened wild type and E2F-1−/− keratinocyte mRNA for genes differentially expressed in the two cell populations. We demonstrate the reduced expression of integrins α5, α6, β1, and β4 in E2F-1−/− keratinocytes associated with reduced activation of Jun terminal kinase and Erk upon integrin stimulation. As a consequence of altered integrin expression and function, E2F-1−/− keratinocytes also show impaired migration, adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, and a blunted chemotactic response to transforming growth factor-γ1. E2F-1−/− keratinocytes, but not dermal fibroblasts, exhibit altered patterns of proliferation, including significant delays in transit through both G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. Recognizing that proliferation and migration are key for proper wound healing in vivo, we postulated that E2F-1−/− mice may exhibit abnormal epidermal repair upon injury. Consistent with our hypothesis, E2F-1−/− mice exhibited impaired cutaneous wound healing. This defect is associated with substantially reduced local inflammatory responses and rates of re-epithelialization.

E2F belongs to a network that also includes cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk), cdk inhibitors, and the retinoblastoma family of proteins (for review, see Refs. 1Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol.

The E2F multigene family consists of two subgroups termed E2F and DP. Functional E2F units are heterodimers composed one E2F and one DP protein. Mammalian E2F-1–5 also have a C-terminal transactivation domain, which mediates binding to retinoblastoma family proteins (for review, see Refs. 1Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol.

The precise biological roles played by each E2F protein are poorly understood. To address this issue, mice with targeted inactivation of E2F genes have been generated. These studies have shown that E2F proteins can fulfil tissue-specific functions. For example, E2F-1 is necessary for thymocyte apoptosis and selection (5Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F. Zubiaga A.M.

Balazsi K. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23531-23538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Mech. Dev. 1997; 66: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Terminal differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes results in pronounced down-regulation of E2F-1 transcripts and protein, and ectopic expression of E2F-1 is sufficient to promote entry into S phase in keratinocytes at any stage of differentiation (14D'Souza S.J.A. Pajak A. Balazsi K. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23531-23538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These properties are consistent with a role for E2F-1 in maintenance of the proliferative state in these cells. A fundamental property of the epidermis is its constant state of self-renewal (for review, see Ref. 16Fuchs E. Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1994; 24: 290-302PubMed Google Scholar). This is accomplished through keratinocyte stem cells, which divide to give rise to new stem cells or to differentiating keratinocytes. The epidermis also has the ability to regenerate upon injury through a dynamic process that involves multiple cell types and responses (for review, see Refs. 17Singer A.J. Clark R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar and 18Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3691) Google Scholar). Cutaneous repair requires blood clotting, inflammation, re-epithelialization, and tissue remodeling. Multiple signals control these processes, including cell interactions with other cells or with the extracellular matrix as well as secretion of and responses to a variety of cytokines. To determine the role that E2F-1 plays in epidermal homeostasis, morphogenesis, and repair, we examined the proliferative and regenerative properties of keratinocytes isolated from E2F-1−/− mice. Our studies demonstrate that E2F-1 is indispensable for normal keratinocyte proliferation in culture and cutaneous wound repair in vivo. Our studies also show a novel, previously unidentified biological role of E2F-1 beyond cell proliferation, which includes modulation of cell adhesion, migration, and chemotaxis through integrin expression and function. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from total RNA obtained from wild type or E2F-1−/−keratinocytes by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Representational difference analysis was performed on the cDNAs prepared as described (20Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). E2F-1−/− keratinocyte cDNA was subtracted three times against wild type cDNA (1:100, 1:400, and 1:800) to generate the final difference products. Integrin mRNA levels were measured using a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR method (21Dagnino L. Lavigne J.P. Nemer M. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) from total RNA prepared from freshly isolated or from cultured keratinocytes. Reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification was conducted on at least two different RNA samples (1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed, and cDNA equivalent to 0.1 μg of RNA was used in each PCR reaction). The primers used were: α5integrin, 5′-CATTTCCGAGTCTGGGCCA and 5′-TGGAGGCTTGAGCTGAGCTT (22Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterop J.J. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar); α6 integrin, 5′-TAGAGCCAGCATCAGAATCCC and 5′-GCTAAGCCTTCGCAGGTGTAT; β1 integrin, 5′-TGTTCAGTGCAGAGCCTTCA and 5′-CCTCATACTTCGGATTGACC (22Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterop J.J. Mizel D.E. Anzano M. Greenwell-Wild T. Wahl S.M. Deng C. Roberts A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar); β4 integrin, 5′-GAGGATCTCCTGCCTAACTAC and 5′-ACTGTTGGTCCATATGAGTGC; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC and 5′-GTTGCCATCAACGACCCCTT or 5′-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATGTCATC and 5′-GTTGCCATCAACGACCCCTT. PCR fragments obtained at 18, 20, 22, and 24 amplification cycles were resolved by electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to appropriate 32P-labeled probes. The signals were detected and quantified using a Canberra-Packard phosphorimager, as described (21Dagnino L. Lavigne J.P. Nemer M. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Dagnino L. Drouin J. Nemer M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase products amplified in the same reactions. For each cDNA, amplification was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis at multiple PCR cycles (18–24 cycles). Amplification of all cDNAs tested was logarithmic within these parameters. In situ hybridization experiments were conducted as described (15Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Mech. Dev. 1997; 66: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using 8-μm frozen sections from wound tissue samples obtained after debridement. Primary keratinocytes were isolated from 1–3-day-old E2F-1−/−, E2F-1+/+, or E2F-1+/− mice (5Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F. Zubiaga A.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Orkin S.H. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) and cultured under non-differentiating conditions as described (14D'Souza S.J.A. Pajak A. Balazsi K. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23531-23538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were conducted on triplicate samples 3–5 days after initial plating in cultures that were 70–80% confluent by the end of the experiment. For proliferation experiments, 2 × 105 cells/well were plated in 12-well culture dishes, and cell numbers were determined daily. To measure DNA synthesis, keratinocyte cultures were incubated with 1.5 μCi/ml [3H]dThd for 3 h, and incorporation into DNA was measured by liquid scintillation counting of trichloroacetic acid-insoluble cell fractions. The 3H activity was normalized to cell numbers. For flow cytometric analyses, 5 × 106 cells/10-cm tissue culture dish were plated and collected at the indicated intervals. Each experiment was conducted on triplicate samples. Pharmacological treatments included culture with human TGF-β1 (Life Science Technologies) at 1, 5, or 10 ng/ml (final), as indicated in individual experiments. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated Primary keratinocytes cultured for 2 days in low calcium medium (0.05 mm CaCl2) were trypsinized, washed, resuspended at 1.5 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free calcium-free Eagle's minimum essential medium, and 200 μl of this cell suspension were added to tissue culture inserts (8-μm pore size, Becton and Dickinson). Test medium in the lower chamber included EMEM, conditioned medium from E2F-1−/−or E2F-1+/+ keratinocytes, or TGF-β11 (1 ng/ml, final). Cells were cultured at 37 °C for 7 h, and those cells that migrated through the membrane were stained with Hemacolor (EM Science) and counted from microscope images obtained with a Leica DMIRBE photomicroscope. Adhesion experiments were conducted on keratinocytes briefly trypsinized and re-plated (100,000 cells/cm2) for 1 h in non-coated culture dishes or on dishes coated with fibronectin, collagen IV (Becton-Dickinson), or laminin as described (24Hertle M.D. Jones P.H. Groves R.W. Hudson D.L. Watt F.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 260-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted on triplicate samples. To obtain ligation of integrins in the absence of other stimuli, keratinocytes were cultured in 0.1% serum and growth factor-free medium for 24 h, detached, and resuspended in serum-free medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated in suspension for 45 min and plated onto dishes previously coated with fibronectin (0.5 mg/ml stock) and collagen I (3 mg/ml stock) or with laminin 5-enriched matrix, prepared as described (25Jones P.H. Watt F.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 713-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). The cells attached and spread equally well on all matrices. Cell lysates from adherent and non-adherent cells were prepared 30 min after plating and subjected to biochemical analysis. Lysis buffer contained 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmγ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Positive controls for JNK and Erk activation were prepared using cell lysates from serum-free adherent cultures exposed to UV irradiation, as described (26Mainiero F. Murgia C. Wary K.K. Curatola A.M. Pepe A. Blumenberg M. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). JNK activity was assessed by measuring phosphorylation of glutathioneS-transferase-Jun fusion proteins with a stress-activated protein kinase/JNK assay kit (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's instructions or from immunoblots prepared from 50 μg of cell lysates/sample and probed with an anti-phospho-JNK antibody (New England Biolabs). Erk activity was measured from immunoblots using a phospho-Erk antibody (New England Biolabs). Signals from the blots were normalized with anti-tubulin or with anti-Erk (total) antibodies (New England Biolabs). The results shown are representative of results obtained from experiments conducted on duplicate samples and repeated four times. Groups of sixteen 6-week-old mice (8 males and 8 females; E2F-1+/+or E2F-1−/−) were used for each time analyzed after wounding. For wound-healing measurements, tails were clipped with a single stroke of a scalpel blade in halothane-anesthetized animals, following a described procedure (27Guo L. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 28Mann G.B. Fowler K.J. Gabriel A. Nice E.C. Williams R.L. Dunn A.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 249-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The animals were sacrificed at the indicated times after tail amputation, and tail stumps containing the healing areas were removed, embedded in OCT compound (Miles), and frozen. The tissue was then used to prepare frozen histological sections. Tissue sections (8 μm) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with hematoxylin and eosin following standard procedures. Measurements of cell numbers/unit area or wound area (measured below the clot) and re-epithelialization were done using Openlab software (Improvision). Representative photographs of sections traversing the tissue in its mid-portion were recorded. Following this approach, % re-epithelialization was calculated from the percentage of distance migrated by newly formed epidermis relative to upper wound width. The values shown in Table I for re-epithelialization at any given time represent the minimum and maximum fraction of epithelialized tissue found per animal in each group of 16 mice. A single value of 100% indicates full re-epithelialization in all 16 animals. Inflammation in tissue sections was assessed by determining the number of inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils) per unit area in Giemsa-stained tissue from wild type and mutant animals, as described (29Ashcroft G.S. Lei K. Jin W. Longenecker G. Kulkarni A.B. Greenwell-Wild T. Hale-Donze H. McGrady G. Song X.-Y. Wahl S.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We scored as (+++) the maximum number of cells observed in wild type wounds (505 ± 79 cells/unit area, mean ± S.E., which were observed at days 1 and 2 post-wounding). Average cell number values in the range 50–166 cells/unit area and 167–333 cells/unit area were scored, respectively, as (+) and (++) in Table I.Table IDelayed wound healing in E2F-1 null miceGenotypeDay 1Day 2Day 3Day 4Day 5Wild typeInflammatory cells (neutrophils, macrophages) (+++)Inflammation (+++)Re-epithelialization 10–15%Partial re-epithelialization 60–70%Re-epithelialized 100%Granulation tissue (++)No re-epithelializationE2F-1−/−Few infiltrating cells (+)Inflammation (+)Inflammation (+++)Granulation tissue (++)Partial re-epithelialization 40–55%1-aFull re-epithelialization at days 7–8.Granulation tissue (+)Granulation tissue (+)Slight re-epithelialization 10–15%No re-epithelializationNo re-epithelializationSixteen age-matched (6-week-old) mice were used per group, 8 males and 8 females.

Average cell number values in the range 50–166 cells/unit area and 167–333 cells/unit area were scored, respectively as (+) and (++). To gain insight into the role of E2F-1 in epidermal morphogenesis, we employed representational difference analysis (20Hubank M. Schatz D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5640-5648Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) to identify genes differentially expressed in E2F-1−/− versus wild type undifferentiated primary keratinocytes. We identified 11 distinct products and compared their sequences with those available in GenBankTM (NCBI) using the FASTA program. The isolated products correspond to nine known and two potentially novel cDNAs down-regulated in mutant keratinocytes. 2S. Murkherjee and L. Dagnino, unpublished data. Four of these cDNAs correspond to integrin gene products, specifically integrins α5, α6, β1, and β4. To confirm that the above described integrins are indeed down-regulated in mutant keratinocytes, we isolated RNA from wild type and E2F-1−/− primary undifferentiated keratinocytes and epidermis and estimated integrin mRNA abundance using a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR approach (21Dagnino L. Lavigne J.P. Nemer M. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Dagnino L. Drouin J. Nemer M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The results of these experiments confirmed that the transcript levels of integrins α5, α6, β1, and β4 are 2–3-fold lower in mutant keratinocytes (Fig. 1 A). We next examined whether decreased integrin transcript levels resulted in altered signaling via integrin heterodimers. Undifferentiated keratinocytes express several integrin heterodimers, including α6β4 and α5β1integrins, which mediate adhesion to and are stimulated by laminin-5 and fibronectin or collagen, respectively. Stimulation of α6β4 integrin by laminin-5 induces activation by phosphorylation of JNK and is key for normal keratinocyte proliferation (26Mainiero F. Murgia C. Wary K.K. Curatola A.M. Pepe A. Blumenberg M. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). To begin to understand the functional consequences of reduced α6 and β4 integrin expression in mutant keratinocytes, we first analyzed the degree of activation of JNK by laminin stimulation of integrin α6β4 in wild type and E2F-1−/− cells. We first compared the abundance of phosphorylated JNK in wild type or E2F-1−/−keratinocyte lysates prepared from suspended keratinocytes (to preclude integrin engagement) or from cells plated on laminin-5. We found that phospho-JNK levels were substantially decreased in laminin-5-stimulated mutant keratinocytes, relative to wild type cells (Fig. 1 B). To confirm these observations, we measured the ability of JNK immunoprecipitates prepared from these lysates to phosphorylatein vitro a glutathione S-transferase-Jun fusion protein. We also found correspondingly similar decreases in phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase-Jun in mutant lysates (data not shown). Thus, the reduced expression of α6 and β4 integrin subunits in mutant keratinocytes is associated with decreased signaling through α6β4 dimers and activation of the JNK pathway. Notably, this phenotype is specific to JNK activation via the integrin pathway, as UV irradiation of quiescent, adherent wild type, and mutant cells resulted in similar degrees of JNK activation (Fig.1 B). Similar to the activation of JNK by laminin, ligation of α5β1 integrin in keratinocytes by fibronectin and/or collagen results in activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, with phosphorylation and consequent activation of Erk (p42 and p44). We measured the levels of active phospho-Erk p42/p44 in lysates from keratinocytes in suspension or plated on fibronectin/collagen I-coated dishes (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with the alteration in integrin α5 and β1 levels, phospho-Erk abundance in E2F-1−/− keratinocytes was substantially lower than in wild type cells. To determine whether the reduced Erk activation was specifically associated with integrin signaling, we measured phosphorylated Erk abundance in quiescent, adherent cells exposed to UV radiation. Irradiated mutant cells exhibited similar levels of Erk phosphorylation than those observed in normal keratinocytes, indicating a selective reduction in Erk activation associated with integrin stimulation. Integrins are central for cell adhesion and migration. Having determined alterations in integrin signaling pathways consequent to E2F-1−/− inactivation, we then examined the consequences of reduced integrin levels and function on keratinocyte migration in response to chemotactic agents. Thus we measured the ability of cells to migrate through culture inserts placed over wells in the presence or absence of chemoattractants (Fig.2 A). Wild type keratinocytes showed the same extent of increased migration toward conditioned media from normal or from E2F-1−/− cultures, indicating that disruption of the E2F-1 gene does not appreciably alter the ability of keratinocytes to secrete chemoattractant factors. TGF-β1 was strongly chemotactic toward normal cells. In contrast, E2F-1−/−keratinocytes exhibited greatly reduced migration both toward TGF-β1 and toward growth factors present in keratinocyte-conditioned media (Fig. 2 A). To investigate whether other responses of E2F-1−/− keratinocytes to TGF-β1 were affected, we also measured the ability of this cytokine to inhibit proliferation of cultured mutant and wild type keratinocytes. Treatment with TGF-β1 for 24 or 48 h inhibited DNA synthesis by 80–90% in both cell types (Fig. 2 B). Thus, E2F-1 inactivation and integrin signaling defects in keratinocytes specifically affect chemotaxis but not proliferative responses to TGF-β1. Keratinocyte migration and adhesion to the extracellular matrix are jointly regulated by integrins. Therefore, we determined the integrin-mediated adhesion properties of wild type and E2F-1−/− keratinocytes toward various extracellular matrix proteins using conventional short term adhesion assays. Primary keratinocytes maintained as basal cells in 0.05 mmextracellular Ca2+ for 3 days were re-plated onto untreated plates or plates coated with fibronectin, collagen IV, laminin-1, or laminin-5. Wild type cells adhered more efficiently to non-coated plates than E2F-1−/− keratinocytes (Fig.3). The numbers of wild type cells that adhered extracellular matrix-coated plates were substantially higher than those on uncoated culture dishes (Fig. 3). In contrast, E2F-1−/− keratinocytes exhibited significantly smaller increases in adhesion in the presence of the extracellular matrix proteins (Fig. 3). Thus, decreased integrin expression appears to be a contributing factor to the impaired migration and adhesion exhibited by mutant keratinocytes. One of the most thoroughly characterized functions of E2F-1 is its ability to promote transit to S phase and cell proliferation (for review, see Ref. 1Nevins J.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). In addition, integrin stimulation is necessary for normal keratinocyte growth (26Mainiero F. Murgia C. Wary K.K. Curatola A.M. Pepe A. Blumenberg M. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Giancotti F.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2365-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 30Haase I. Hobbs R.M. Romero R. Broad S. Watt F.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Hence, we next characterized the proliferative capacity of primary epidermal keratinocytes as well as dermal fibroblasts isolated from wild type, E2F-1+/−, and E2F-1−/−mice. We first measured the growth rates of primary cultured keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Wild type and heterozygote E2F-1+/− keratinocytes proliferated at similar rates throughout the experiment (8 days), with a mean doubling time of about 33 h (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, E2F-1−/− keratinocytes did not complete a population doubling within 8 days after plating (Fig. 4 A). Based on the experimental data obtained, the estimated doubling time of these cells in culture is 250 h, about 7-fold greater than that in wild-type cells. This failure of E2F-1−/− keratinocytes to divide was accompanied by a reduced capacity to synthesize DNA (Fig.4 B). DNA synthetic capacity was not altered in E2F-1+/− keratinocytes, indicating the lack of gene dosage effects. The low proliferation rates and DNA synthetic capacity in E2F-1−/− keratinocytes did not arise from increased cell loss, as evidenced by the ability to exclude trypan blue of >95% of cells"
https://openalex.org/W2164200714,"293 kidney embryonic cells feature very low levels of the anti-apoptotic protein PED. In these cells, expression of PED to levels comparable with those occurring in normal adult cells inhibits apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation and by exposure to H(2)O(2) or anisomycin. In PED-expressing 293 cells (293(PED)), inhibition of apoptosis upon growth factor deprivation was paralleled by decreased phosphorylation of JNK1/2. In 293(PED) cells, decreased apoptosis induced by anisomycin and H(2)O(2) was also accompanied by block of JNK1/2 and p38 phosphorylations, respectively. Impaired activity of these stress kinases by PED correlated with inhibition of stress-induced Cdc-42, MKK4, and MKK6 activation. At variance with JNK1/2 and p38, PED expression increased basal and growth factor-stimulated Ras-Raf-1 co-precipitation and MAPK phosphorylation and activity. Treatment of 293(PED) cells with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylations with no effect on inhibition of JNK1/2 and p38 activities. Complete rescue of JNK and p38 functions in 293(PED) cells by overexpressing JNK1 or p38, respectively, enabled only partial recovery of apoptotic response to growth factor deprivation and anisomycin. However, simultaneous rescue of JNK and p38 activities accompanied by block of ERK1/2 fully restored these responses. Thus, PED controls activity of the ERK, JNK, and p38 subfamilies of MAPKs. PED anti-apoptotic function in the 293 cells requires PED simultaneous activation of ERK1/2 and inhibition of the JNK/p38 signaling systems by PED."

These structures also contain Pex14p and can develop into functional peroxisomes after subsequent reintroduction of the full-length Pex3p protein.

We discuss the significance of this finding in relation to peroxisome reintroduction, e.g. in case peroxisomes are lost due to failure in inheritance. Peroxisomes are remarkable among the various classes of cell organelles in that their function and abundance varies dependent on the organism, the environmental conditions, and the physiological state of the cell. Yeast are favorable model organisms to study peroxisome biogenesis because of a number of properties. Firstly, peroxisome proliferation can be strictly regulated by growth conditions, ranging from one small organelle when cells are grown in rich media containing glucose, to over 20 during growth of cells on oleate (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Yarrowia lipolytica, and Pichia pastoris) or methanol (Hansenula polymorpha, P. pastoris) (1.Veenhuis M. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1992; 10: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2.Kunau W.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, peroxisomes house the key enzymes involved in the metabolism of these carbon sources. Secondly, peroxisomes are not essential for yeast cell viability when they are grown under peroxisome-repressing conditions in rich media. This feature has led to the isolation of various yeast peroxisome assembly (pex)-deficient mutants that are unable to utilize either oleate or methanol for growth (3.Erdmann R. Veenhuis M. Kunau W.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 400-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4.Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 5.Hettema E.H. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). With few exceptions (see below), these pex mutant cells still contain peroxisomal membrane remnants (“ghosts”). Through genetic complementation, 23PEX genes have currently been characterized (5.Hettema E.H. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Data base searches using the yeast genes have presently revealed 13 human orthologues of yeast PEX genes. Mutations in 11 of these human PEX genes have been characterized and shown to be the molecular basis for inherited peroxisome biogenesis disorders, including Zellweger Syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum's disease and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata (6.Braverman N. Dodt G. Gould S.J. Valle D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1791-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7.Wanders R.J. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 565-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The analysis of the PEX genes and the peroxins they encode has predominantly shed light on the molecular components involved in peroxisomal matrix protein import (reviewed in Refs. 4.Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 5.Hettema E.H. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 17-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Relatively less is known of the biogenesis of the peroxisomal membrane and the sorting mechanisms of the proteins it contains. Earlier work showed that peroxisomal membrane proteins, like peroxisomal matrix proteins, are synthesized on free polysomes in the cytosol and are posttranslationally transported to the peroxisome (8.Fujiki Y. Rachubinski R.A. Lazarow P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7127-7131Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Together with morphological studies on peroxisome proliferation, these data have led to the hypothesis that peroxisomes develop by fission from preexisting ones (9.Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev.

Several recent studies have assessed the question of the origin of the peroxisomal membrane upon reappearance of the organelles in pex-mutants lacking peroxisomal membranes. We studied this process in a temperature-sensitive pex mutant of the yeast H. polymorpha (15.Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Swaving G.J. Harder W. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4785-4794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal membrane remnants were undetectable in these cells when grown at restrictive temperatures (43 °C). Shifting these cells to permissive conditions (37 °C) led to a rapid (within 30 min) reappearance of peroxisomes. Concurrently, South and Gould (20.South S.T. Gould S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), Matsuzono et al. (19.Matsuzono Y. Kinoshita N. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Hamasaki M. Ghaedi K. Wanders R.J. Suzuki Y. Kondo N.

Peroxisomal remnants were absent in these cells also, but intact organelles were assembled upon reintroduction of the complementing gene. As suggested before by Waterham et al. (15.Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Swaving G.J. Harder W. Veenhuis M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4785-4794Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), these studies revealed that peroxisomes do not necessarily derive from preexisting ones, but failed to identify the alternative origin. Therefore, we set out to study the reappearance of peroxisomes in H. polymorpha pex3 cells in detail upon reintroduction of full-length Pex3p, a peroxisomal membrane protein, and hybrid proteins consisting of N-terminal fragments of Pex3p and either GFP or β-lactamase. Here we show that the N-terminal 50 amino acids of Pex3p induce the formation of vesicles in the vicinity of the nuclear membrane. These Pex3p1–50 vesicles are the specific target for peroxisome development after subsequent synthesis of full-length Pex3p. H. polymorphaNCYC495 (leu1.1) and derivatives of this strain (listed in Table I) were grown at 37 °C in batch cultures in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone, 2% glucose) or in mineral medium (22.van Dijken J.P.

In addition to the standard sucrose density gradients routinely used to purify peroxisomes from WT H. polymorpha, we used a modified gradient consisting of 4 ml 65%, 4 ml 50%, 4 ml 46%, 8 ml 40% 4 ml 35% and 4 ml 30% (w/v)-sucrose in buffer B (5 mm MES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm KCl, pH 5.5) loaded with an organellar pellet resuspended in 5 ml of homogenization buffer (5 mm MES, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm KCl, 1.2m sorbitol, pH 5.5) and centrifuged for 3 h at 33,000 × g.

Whole cells and organellar fractions were fixed and prepared for electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry as described previously (34.Douma A.C. Veenhuis M. Sulter G.J. Harder W. Arch.

Immunolabeling was performed on ultrathin sections of unicryl-embedded cells, using specific antibodies against various H. polymorpha proteins, GFP and β-lactamase, and gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (GAR-gold) antibodies according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Double immunocytochemical labeling using two polyclonal antisera and different-sized gold particles (5-nm and 15-nm GAR-gold) was performed according to Bendayan (36.Bendayan M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1982; 30: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Similar to pex3 cells from other organisms, H. polymorpha pex3 cells grown in batch cultures on methanol do not contain detectable peroxisomal membrane remnants, and proteins normally residing in the peroxisomal matrix accumulate in the cytosol. However, normal peroxisomes rapidly reappear in such cells upon reintroduction of the complementing PEX3 gene (16.Baerends R.J.S. Rasmussen S.W. Hilbrands R.E. van der Heide M. Faber K.N. Reuvekamp P.T. Kiel J.A.K.W. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8887-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In an attempt to shed light on the origin of these organelles, we introduced hybrid genes encoding N-terminal fragments of Pex3p (containing its putative peroxisomal targeting signal) and a reporter gene (GFP or β-lactamase) in pex3 cells and determined the subcellular location of the gene products. Pex3 cells producing the Pex3p1–50GFP hybrid protein (strain HF78) contained one or few bright fluorescent spots (Fig. 1B, right panel); in WT controls (strain HF75) this protein was efficiently targeted to peroxisomes (Fig. 1A, right panel; Ref. 27.Baerends R.J.S. Faber K.N. Kram A.M. Kiel J.A.K.W. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9986-9995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy showed that HF78 cells contained a cluster of small vesicular structures in close proximity to the nucleus (Fig. 1C). These structures were never observed in the pex3 parental strain (not shown, cf. Ref. 16.Baerends R.J.S. Rasmussen S.W. Hilbrands R.E. van der Heide M. Faber K.N. Reuvekamp P.T. Kiel J.A.K.W. Cregg J.M. van der Klei I.J. Veenhuis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8887-8894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or in WT cells. These membrane structures were the subcellular site of the Pex3p1–50GFP hybrid protein as was shown by immunocytochemistry using α-GFP antibodies (Fig. 1D). The presence of these membranes was not the result of the overproduction of the hybrid protein. Similar patterns of fluorescence (Fig. 1C, inset) and membrane vesicles (not shown) were observed when the Pex3p1–50GFP protein was produced by the PEX3-promoter element, though less abundantly. These data show that synthesis of the 50 N-terminal amino acids of Pex3p fused to a reporter protein, induces proliferation of membranous structures. From here, we refer to these membrane structures as Pex3p1–50 vesicles. To determine the nature of the Pex3p1–50 vesicles, we set out to purify them, using GFP as a marker protein. The conventional biochemical procedure for the isolation of intact peroxisomes from H. polymorpha WT cells (homogenization of protoplasts followed by sucrose-density gradient centrifugation of a postnuclear supernatant (PNS)) applied on HF78 cells resulted in a distinct localization of Pex3p1–50GFP at densities of ∼30–40% sucrose, colocalizing with ER and mitochondrial marker proteins (Fig. 2). To separate the Pex3p1–50 vesicles from other cell constituents, we adjusted the sucrose density profile of the gradient to obtain a better separation at sucrose concentrations of 30–40% and loaded the gradient with an organellar fraction instead of a PNS. Fig. 3 shows that a clear separation was achieved between the Pex3p1–50 vesicles (peak fractions at 32–36% sucrose) and the mitochondria (peak fractions at 36–42% sucrose). Comparison of the fractions most enriched for Pex3p1–50GFP, mitochondria, and ER marker proteins (peak fractions at 38–41% sucrose) revealed that Pex14p, a peroxisomal membrane protein that is mislocalized to mitochondria in pex3 cells (27.Baerends R.J.S.

This finding was further substantiated by immunocytochemical analysis of the organellar fraction (Fig. 4, A and B) and whole cells (Fig. 6E, see below). The Pex3p1–50 vesicles were readily identifiable in the organellar fraction by immunocytochemistry, using specific antibodies against GFP, and were clearly distinct from other structures in these fractions, such as mitochondria and plasma membrane vesicles (Fig. 4A). Clearly, αPex14p-dependent-specific labeling was only found on the Pex3p1–50 vesicles (Fig. 4B). In addition, co-localization of Pex31–50β-lactamase and endogenous Pex14p on the Pex3p1–50 vesicles was observed in double-labeling experiments performed on ultrathin sections of pex3 cells producing Pex31–50β-lactamase (Fig. 6E).Figure 3Pex3p1–50 vesicles harbor peroxisomal characteristics. A, a sucrose density gradient with an adapted sucrose density profile was used to fractionate an organellar pellet fraction prepared from glycerol/methanol-grown HF78 cells. Individual fractions were analyzed for sucrose density (+), protein concentration (○), and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity (▾).

To this end, HF75 (WT::PAOX-PEX31–50 GFP) and HF78 cells (pex3::PAOX-PEX31–50 GFP) were grown in glycerol/methanol-containing media to induce peroxisome and Pex3p1–50 vesicle formation, respectively. Next, these cells were transferred to fresh glucose media, thus repressing peroxisome and vesicle formation, and the fate of AO and GFP was followed in time. As expected, in HF75 control cells both the level of peroxisomal AO and Pex3p1–50GFP decreased significantly (Fig. 3C), and after 4 h of induction in glucose medium, a few small peroxisomes were observed by fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy (data not shown).

The oncogenic tyrosine kinase Bcr-Abl has been shown to activate Rac-1, which is important for Bcr-Abl induced leukemogenesis. Previous studies by Matsuguchi et al. (Matsuguchi, T., Inhorn, R.

Here, we report the identification of a direct complex between Vav and Bcr-Abl in yeast, in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we show tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav by Bcr-Abl. Mutational analysis revealed that the SH2 domain and the C-terminal SH3 domain as well as a tetraproline motif directly adjacent to the N-terminal SH3 domain of Vav are important for establishing this phosphotyrosine dependent interaction. Activation of Rac-1 by Bcr-Abl was abrogated by co-expression of the Vav C terminus encoding the SH3-SH2-SH3 domains as a dominantnegative construct. Bcr-Abl transduced primary bone marrow from Vav knock-out mice showed reduced proliferation in a culture cell transformation assay compared with wild-type bone marrow. These results suggest, that Bcr-Abl utilizes Vav as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor to activate Rac-1 in a process that involves a folding mechanism of the Vav C terminus. Given the importance of Rac-1 activation for Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis, this mechanism may be crucial for the molecular pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia and of importance for other signal transduction pathways leading to the activation of Rac-1.

Vav has been shown to be important for the transduction of signals from the T-cell receptor; Vav knock-out animals have defects in T cell development, and their T-cells proliferate poorly and produce little IL-2 in response to T-cell receptor stimulation (4.Turner M.

In addition, Vav-deficient T-cells have specific defects in T-cell receptor-induced calcium fluxes and in the activation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and NF-κB pathways (8.Costello P.S.

Vav is phosphorylated in response to T-cell receptor stimulation and to cytokines and growth factors like IL-3, SCF, platelet-derived growth factor, or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, suggesting that it is also involved in the signal transduction pathways activated by these receptors (9.Margolis B.

Through this mechanism, the SH2 domain of Vav mediates association with the tyrosine kinase receptor itself or with cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases like Lyn, JAK, or ZAP-70 (3.Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell.

Vav has been shown to be a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) for members of the Rho family of GTPases (14.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav in vitro and in vivo by the tyrosine kinase Lck can activate its Rac GEF activity (14.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The GEF activity of Vav is encoded by the Dbl homology domain. In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, products of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase activation have been proposed to contribute to the GEF activation of Vav via the PH domain (15.Han J.

Among them, as mentioned above, are tyrosine kinases such as Lck, JAK-2, and ZAP-70, which bind to the SH2 domain, and adapter molecules like Cbl, Grb2, and SLB70, binding to the SH3 domain. In addition, heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP), the focal adhesion protein zyxin, Ku-70, hnRNP-c, and hSiah2 have been identified as binding partners of Vav (reviewed in Ref. 3.Bustelo X.R.

The chimeric oncogene Bcr-Abl is crucial for the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (16.Sawyers C.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 1330-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). The dysregulated tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl has been shown responsible for the transformation of fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells and for the induction of a CML-like disease in mice (17.Daley G.Q. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9312-9316Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 18.Daley G.Q. Van Etten R.A. Baltimore D.

Bcr-Abl contains several autophosphorylation sites, which can serve as docking sites for SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules, some of which may be critical for the transformation ability of Bcr-Abl. One of the best studied and defined interactions is the binding of Grb2 to tyrosine 177 in the Bcr part of Bcr-Abl, which links Bcr-Abl to Sos/Ras pathway (21.Puil L. Liu J. Gish G. Mbamalu G.

In addition, a multitude of other adapter proteins and substrates of Bcr-Abl have been identified such as Grb10, Grb4, SHC, Crk, Crkl, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription), which are thought to be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of CML (23.Bai R.

Thus, screening for Bcr-Abl-interacting proteins seems an efficient method of identifying molecules important for Bcr-Abl-induced leukemia. Recently it has been shown that Bcr-Abl expression in Mo7e cells results in constitutive phosphorylation of Vav (11.Matsuguchi T. Inhorn R.C. Carlesso N. Xu G. Druker B. Griffin J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, the authors could not detect coprecipitation of Vav and Bcr-Abl. Instead it was reported that Vav associates and is phosphorylated by JAK-2 in these cells (11.Matsuguchi T. Inhorn R.C. Carlesso N. Xu G. Druker B. Griffin J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this paper, in contrast to the previous report, we demonstrate that Vav interacts directly with Bcr-Abl. This interaction is dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl and an unusual binding mechanism involving a proline-rich region and the two SH3 domains framing the SH2 domain of Vav. We present evidence that complex formation of Bcr-Abl and Vav is necessary for activation of the Rac pathway by Bcr-Abl, which has been shown to be crucial for Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis (34.Skorski T. Wlodarski P. Daheron L. Salomoni P. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Majewski M. Wasik M. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11858-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The DNA for Bcr-AblΔSal was cloned into the yeast expression vector BTM116 (35.Weidner K.M. Di C.S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). A cDNA library derived from K562 cells was used (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) as the prey. Various Bcr-Abl mutants were used in the screen as described previously (23.Bai R. Jahn T. Schrem S. Munzert G. Weidner K. JYJ W. Duyster J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24.Coutinho S. Jahn T. Lewitzky M. Feller S. Hutzler P. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 618-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro translation and expression in 293 cells, the cDNAs of Bcr-Abl WT, Bcr-Abl mutants, F46Wt, and the F46 mutants were cloned in pcDNA 3.1, a mammalian expression vector containing the cytomegalovirus promoter and the SV40 origin of replication (Invitrogen). Cloning of the corresponding human F46/Vav mutant into the full-length murine Vav c-DNA generated VavR696L and VavAAΔCSH3. Expression of these chimerical constructs was performed using the pCMV Tag II vector (Invitrogen). Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants Bcr-Abl/115F, Bcr/177F-Abl, Bcr/246F-Abl, Bcr/246F-Abl/449F, Bcr/246F-Abl/342F, 449F, Bcr/246F-Abl/353F, 449F, and Bcr/177F-Abl/393 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using overlapping oligonucleotides and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). The numbers correspond to the human Bcr and murine c-Abl sequence. The Bcr-Abl temperature-sensitive mutant (TSBcr-Abl) was generated by subcloning a temperature-sensitive v-Abl mutant (DP) into Bcr-Abl (23.Bai R. Jahn T. Schrem S. Munzert G. Weidner K. JYJ W. Duyster J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The Bcr/1–509-Abl, Bcr/1–242-Abl, and Bcr/1–63-Abl constructs have been described previously (4.Turner M. Mee P.J. Walters A.E. Quinn M.E. Mellor A.L. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Point mutations of the F46/Vav cDNA were conducted using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit following the instructions of the supplier (Stratagene), and deletion mutants were made by PCR using oligonucleotides containing EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites and standard cloning procedures. All constructs derived from site-directed mutagenesis and PCR were verified by automatic sequence analysis. 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% FCS and penicillin/streptomycin (200 units of penicillin/ml and 200 μg of streptomycin/ml). K562, Jurkat, Mo7e, and Mo7e/p210 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed, Berlin, Germany) and penicillin/streptomycin. The medium for Mo7e was supplemented with granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R&D Systems DPC Bierman GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany). SCF stimulation of Mo7e cells was performed at a final concentration of 200 ng/ml SCF at 37 °C for 5 min and subsequent resuspension in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Transfections were performed with the DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cDNAs of F46/Vav and F46/Vav mutants were cloned in-frame into the vector pGEX KG to make GST (glutathione S-transferase) fusion proteins. WT and mutant Bcr-Abl proteins were in vitro translated and 35S-radiolabeled using the TNT system (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). The translation mix was diluted to a final concentration of 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm cold ATP and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C to allow for autophosphorylation of the translated proteins. Reactions were stopped by dilution to a final concentration of 10 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each phenantroline, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (lysis buffer). GST fusion proteins were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were collected on glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), washed thoroughly with NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris·HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine), and subjected to SDS-PAGE. In vitro translated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For binding experiments with cell extracts, 1 × 107 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer, precleared with glutathione-beads, and incubated with the GST fusion protein for 3 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes were collected on glutathione-beads, washed thoroughly with lysis buffer or NETN buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with the antibodies indicated. Bcr-Abl and Abl was detected by immunoblotting using an Abl-specific antibody 8E9 (BD PharMingen, Hamburg, Germany). Tyrosine phosphorylation was detected with the monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and PY20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Polyclonal anti-Vav and anti-Rac-1 antibodies came from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany. Monoclonal anti-Xpress® and anti-Flag antibodies were from Invitrogen. Immunoprecipitation was done as described previously (36.Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each phenantroline, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. After clarification by centrifugation, antibody-protein complexes were brought down with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Immunoprecipitations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Abl (8E9), monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology), PY20 (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Flag (Invitrogen), and polyclonal anti-Vav antibodies (Santa Cruz) as described previously (36.Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Bands were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Bcr-Abl and kinase-defective Bcr-Abl were in vitro translated using the TNT system (Promega). The translation mix was diluted to a final concentration of 10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each phenantroline, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 2 μg of anti-Abl (Ab-3). The immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads, washed twice each with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, lysis buffer plus 100 mm NaCl, and lysis buffer alone and twice with kinase buffer containing 25 mm Tris· HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer with 1 μg of GST-F46/Vav as a substrate. Reactions were started by the addition of 15 μm cold ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer, heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. 293 cells (3 × 105) were cotransfected in 60-mm dishes using the DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 3 μg of plasmid encoding Rac-1, 2.5 μg of the plasmid expressing WT-Bcr-Abl, KD-Bcr-Abl, or the control vector, and 5 μg of the dominant-negative construct Vav/F46 or Vav/F46AAΔCSH3 or the control vector. 65 h post-transfection, cells were starved in FCS-free media and harvested 12 h later. Cell lysates were precleared with glutathione-beads and incubated with equal amounts of GST-PAK for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were detected with a Rac-1 specific antibody (Santa Cruz). To normalize transfection efficiencies, lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Rac-1 (Santa Cruz), anti-Abl 8E9 (BD PharMingen), and anti-Xpress® (Invitrogen). Retroviral supernatant was produced by transiently transfecting the Phoenix ecotropic producer line (Gary Nolan, Stanford, CA) with the Mig-p210 or Mig vectors (W. Pear, Philadelphia, PA) as described previously (37.Bai R.Y. Ouyang T. Miething C. Morris S.W. Peschel C. Duyster J. Blood. 2000; 96: 4319-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Medium was changed at 36 h after transfection and collected after 48 h. Titers of ∼1 × 105-1 × 106 helper virus-free viral particles were obtained as measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter titer of EGFP-positive infected Rat-1 cells. 2 × 104 cells were seeded onto each 60-mm culture dish in IMDM containing 10% FCS and 0.1% agarose on a base of bottom agar (IMDM, 10% FCS, 0.6% agar). The growth layer was allowed to harden and was subsequently overlaid with a top agar layer (IMDM, 10% FCS, 0.1% agar). Colonies were analyzed ∼2 weeks after plating. Wild-type and Vav−/− mice (4.Turner M. Mee P.J. Walters A.E. Quinn M.E. Mellor A.L. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 451-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) were treated with 150 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil 4 days prior to bone marrow harvest. BM cells flushed from tibia and femur were preincubated for 1 day in bone marrow medium (IMDM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 30% FCS (Seromed), 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% glutamine, 0,5% penicillin-streptomycin, 100 μm2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μm hydrocortisone) 50 ng/ml mouse SCF, 8 ng/ml mouse IL-3, and 12 ng/ml human IL-6 (all from R&D Systems). After 1 day of preincubation, 1 × 106 bone marrow cells were coincubated with 3 ml of viral supernatant and 1 ml of new medium in the presence of the above mentioned growth factors and 4 μg/ml polybrene. New supernatant was added after 24 h. 3 days after infection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Transformation of bone marrow cells in liquid culture was determined as described previously (39.Afar D.E. Han L. McLaughlin J. Wong S. Dhaka A. Parmar K. Rosenberg N. Witte O.N. Colicelli J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 105 infected cells were plated in bone marrow medium in 12-well plates in a volume of 2 ml. Nonadherent cells were counted after 9 days. To isolate signaling intermediates important for the oncogenic signal transduction of Bcr-Abl, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed using Bcr-(1–509)-Abl/Lex A as a bait and a cDNA library obtained from a cell line established from a CML patient in blast crisis of the disease (K562). An identical 800-bp clone was isolated four times, which encoded the C-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3 region of p95 Vav (F46/Vav, amino acids 560–845) (Table I). Co-expression of kinase-active Bcr-Abl and F46/Vav resulted in histidine autotrophy and growth of the yeast cells, indicating interaction of Bcr-Abl with F46/Vav (Fig. 1A). The interaction of Vav/F46 and Bcr-Abl was specific, as the control protein lamin showed no binding (Fig. 1A). Yeast cells co-expressing F46/Vav and a tyrosine kinase-defective mutant of Bcr-Abl (KDBcr-Abl) failed to grow, indicating that Bcr-Abl autophosphorylation is required for this interaction (Fig. 1A). Binding of F46/Vav to Bcr-Abl in yeast suggested a direct interaction between Vav and Bcr-Abl. To confirm a direct association of Bcr-Abl and Vav/F46, we tested the ability of GST-Vav/F46 to bind to in vitro translated Bcr-Abl. Fig. 1B shows that Vav/F46 is able to directly bind to Bcr-Abl in vitro. Moreover, we found two constructs carrying internal deletions in the Bcr part of Bcr-Abl (BCR/1–242-Abl and BCR/1–63-Abl) to bind to GST-Vav/F46 (data not shown). Bcr/1–63-Abl is missing the autophosphorylation site Tyr177 responsible for the binding of Bcr-Abl to Grb2, indicating that an Abl phosphorylation site other than Tyr177 is responsible for this phosphotyrosine-dependent interaction. These results together with the data obtained in yeast suggested that the Vav SH2 domain binds to an autophosphorylation site located in the Abl part of Bcr-Abl, which is different from Tyr177. Concordant with this hypothesis, complex formation of Vav could also be demonstrated with v-Abl (Fig. 2D). One tyrosine residue within the Abl portion of Bcr-Abl resembles, at least in part, the predicted consensus site for the Vav SH2 domain, YMEP, which is tyrosine 115 with the sequence -YITP- (40.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. McGlade J. Olivier P. Pawson T. Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Sabe H. Hanafusa H. Yi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify the tyrosine residue in Abl that is responsible for complex formation with Vav, a series of tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations and combinations thereof were introduced into Bcr-Abl. These mutants, including Abl Tyr115, Abl Tyr393, the major Abl autophosphorylation site, and the Grb2 binding site, Bcr Tyr177, were tested for their ability to bind to the Vav/F46 fragment in a GST pull-down assay (Abl numbers refer to the Abl Ia isoform). All of the tested tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutants retained the ability to bind Vav/F46 (data not shown). Thus, the complex between Vav and Bcr-Abl may involve multiple tyrosine residues or involve other binding motifs and intermediate proteins (for example, c-Cbl). Alternatively the binding may be dependent on a so-called “open” conformation that can only be adopted by kinase-active Bcr-Abl, as shown by the paper of Schindler et al. (41.Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar).Table IBinding of Vav/F46 mutants to Bcr-AblEqual amounts of GST fusion proteins of the represented Vav/F46 mutants were tested for their binding affinity to Bcr-Abl from K562 lysates of 5 × 106 cells in a GST pull-down assay as described in Fig. 4. The amino acid numbers of the F46/Vav fragments are indicated. +++, strong binding; (+), very weak binding; −, no binding. R696L is an SH2 mutant defective in phosphotyrosine binding. AASH3-SH2-SH3 is a proline-to-alanine mutant of four prolines (amino acids 607–610). Dbl, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; SH, Src homology; p-rich, proline-rich.

https://openalex.org/W2319919892,"Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is considered a uniquely important tumor marker and is broadly used for early detection of prostate cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying its elevated expression in tumors have been unknown. By using cDNA microarray gene expression profiling, we found a fourfold increase in the PSA mRNA level in prostatic carcinoma cell line LNCaP, in which the p53 pathway was suppressed by a dominant negative p53 mutant. Consistently, p53 suppression caused a 4-8-fold increase in secretion of PSA protein in culture medium, suggesting that PSA gene expression is under negative control of p53. While wild type p53 strongly repressed, dominant negative p53 mutants stimulated PSA promoter-driven transcription and secretion of PSA in transient transfection experiments. The inhibitory effect of wild type p53 was undetectable in the presence of trichostatin A, suggesting the involvement of histone deacetylation in negative regulation of PSA promoter activity. Thus, PSA is likely to be a tissue specific indicator of transformation-associated p53 suppression in prostate cells. This finding provides a plausible explanation for a frequent increase of PSA levels in advanced prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2054565728,"We have investigated the molecular mechanisms whereby the I-II loop controls voltage-dependent inactivation in P/Q calcium channels. We demonstrate that the I-II loop is localized in a central position to control calcium channel activity through the interaction with several cytoplasmic sequences; including the III-IV loop. Several experiments reveal the crucial role of the interaction between the I-II loop and the III-IV loop in channel inactivation. First, point mutations of two amino acid residues of the I-II loop of Cav2.1 (Arg-387 or Glu-388) facilitate voltage-dependent inactivation. Second, overexpression of the III-IV loop, or injection of a peptide derived from this loop, produces a similar inactivation behavior than the mutated channels. Third, the III-IV peptide has no effect on channels mutated in the I-II loop. Thus, both point mutations and overexpression of the III-IV loop appear to act similarly on inactivation, by competing off the native interaction between the I-II and the III-IV loops of Cav2.1. As they are known to affect inactivation, we also analyzed the effects of β subunits on these interactions. In experiments in which the β4 subunit is co-expressed, the III-IV peptide is no longer able to regulate channel inactivation. We conclude that (i) the contribution of the I-II loop to inactivation is partly mediated by an interaction with the III-IV loop and (ii) the β subunits partially control inactivation by modifying this interaction. These data provide novel insights into the mechanisms whereby the β subunit, the I-II loop, and the III-IV loop altogether can contribute to regulate inactivation in high voltage-activated calcium channels.

Both the amplitude and the duration of the calcium influx shape the spatio-temporal efficacy of calcium signaling. A tight control of both processes is needed to avoid long term increases in intracellular calcium levels, which are cytotoxic to neurons. Although the control of calcium entry can be achieved in several ways, inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channels appears to represent a key molecular process. For instance, inactivation is considered as a candidate mechanism for synaptic depression (1Forsythe I.D. Tsujimoto T. Barnes-Davies M. Cuttle M.F. Takahashi T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 797-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 2Patil P.G. Brody D.L. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as there are several calcium channel types, there are also several inactivation behaviors.l-type calcium channels inactivate slowly, whereas the neuronal N-, P/Q-, and R-type channels inactivate faster. These fundamental differences are linked to the pore-forming Cavsubunit, which contains the major molecular determinants for inactivation, although auxiliary subunits can play a regulatory function in this process. Although significant advances have been made to the understanding of the mechanisms whereby inactivation proceeds in voltage-dependent Na+ and K+channels, there are still major challenges lying ahead in the calcium channel field. The first challenge is a result of the ever increasing number of molecular determinants proposed to play a role in inactivation. A study by Zhang et al. (3Zhang J.-F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) revealed that the S6 region of domain I is a critical determinant of voltage-dependent inactivation in Cav2.1 and Cav2.3 channels. Since that pioneering work, several other sequences have been implicated in inactivation, including the I-II linker domain (4Bourinet E. Soong T.W. Sutton K. Slaymaker S. Mathews E. Monteil A. Zamponi G.W. Nargeot J. Snutch T.P. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), the proximal carboxyl terminus (5Soldatov N.M. Zühlke R.D. Bouron A. Reuter H. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the midst of this apparent complexity, and contrary to all expectations, it was found that voltage and calcium may use the same molecular determinants to inactivate calcium channels (9Cens T. Reste S. Galas S. Charnet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5483-5490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This basic observation points to the possibility that there may be an elusive mechanism whereby the various structural elements identified so far are coordinated to produce inactivation in calcium channels. A further challenge in solving the issue of calcium channel inactivation stems from a still greater level of complexity that is introduced by β subunit regulation. Clearly, these auxiliary subunits possess an enormous potential for in vivo tuning of channel behavior (2Patil P.G. Brody D.L. Yue D.T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1027-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 10Wei S.-K. Colecraft H.M. DeMaria C.D. Peterson B.Z. Zhang R. Kohout T.A. Rogers T.B. Yue D.T. Circ. Res. 1999; 86: 175-184Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This behavior is expected because β subunit can bind to several Cav structures: the I-II loop (11De Pragnell M. Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), the amino terminus (12Walker D. Bichet D. Geib S. Mori E. Cornet V. Snutch T.P. Mori Y. De Waard M. J.

Physiol. 2000; 525: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl terminus (14Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The most interesting candidate sequence to investigate in terms of β-dependent inactivation appears to be the I-II loop. First, it contains the α1 interaction domain (AID),1 which is the only Cav sequence identified that is able to bind all β subunit isoforms (11De Pragnell M. Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). For some β subunits (i.e.β3), it represents even the only interacting sequence (12Walker D. Bichet D. Geib S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Second, this sequence seems to have a central role in many other β regulatory functions (14Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 17Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. De Waard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Third, deletions in β sequence, upstream and downstream of the β interaction domain, that interacts with the I-II loop, produce either faster or slower inactivation (18De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1994; 13: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), presumably by altering the regulatory input of β subunit at its main interaction site. In support of such an interpretation, Qin and collaborators (19Qin N. Olcese R. Zhou J. Cabello O.A. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1539-C1545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that the intermediate splicing region of β subunits, located immediately upstream of the β interaction domain site, is a critical β subunit determinant for inactivation. Overall, these data indicate that the I-II loop plays a crucial role in inactivation and that it represents a critical β-dependent element of this process. Here, we have investigated some of the β-dependent mechanisms whereby the I-II loop controls inactivation in voltage-dependent P/Q calcium channels. We demonstrate that two nonconserved residues of Cav2.1 (Arg-387 and Glu-388; Ref. 20Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) are required for the control of channel inactivation. This effect is a result of their implication in the interaction between the I-II and III-IV loops of the channel. Accordingly, a peptide derived from the III-IV loop potently modulates the voltage-dependent inactivation of Cav2.1. Co-expression of the β subunit prevents this effect suggesting that the β subunit, two sites of mutations in the I-II loop, and the III-IV peptide contribute to inactivation by coordinated interactions. We propose that the β subunit regulates voltage-dependent inactivation by neutralizing the contribution of the III-IV loop to this process. Stepwise elongation of the 40-mer (III-IV loop from Ser-1535 to Ser-1574 of Cav2.1; amidated form) was carried out on 0.35 mmol of Fmoc amide resin (1% cross-linked; 0.62 meq of amino group/g) using a peptide synthesizer (model 433A, Applied Biosystems Inc.). Trifunctional amino acids were side-chain protected as follows: trityl for Cys, His, and Asn; t-butyl for Ser and Asp; t-butyloxycarbonyl for Lys; and pentamethylchroman for Arg. Each coupling cycle comprised: (i) unblocking of the α-amino group by piperidine (18 and 20% inN-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) for 3 and 8 min); washings with NMP (5 × 1 min); (ii) coupling of the Fmoc amino acids (1 mmol) as their hydroxybenzotriazole active esters in NMP. The peptide resin was treated 2 h at 25 °C with trifluoroacetic acid containing 5% thioanisole, 5% ethanedithiol in a final volume of 10 ml/g of peptide resin. The peptide was precipitated and washed twice by adding cold diethyl ether. The resulting crude peptide was pelleted by centrifugation (3000 × g; 10 min), and the final pellets were dissolved in H2O and freeze-dried. The peptide (50-mg batches) was purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, ODS 20 μm, 100 × 10 mm) using a 2-h linear gradient from 0 to 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (buffer A) and 70% acetonitrile in H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer B) at a flow rate of 6 ml/min, with UV detection at 230 nm. Fractions were collected and analyzed by analytical HPLC. Fractions containing the purified peptide (>99% homogeneity) were pooled and lyophilized. The chemical identity of the synthetic peptide was assessed by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis (6 nHCl, 1% (mass/volume) phenol, 20 h, 120 °C); and mass determination by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. AID chimeras were produced by a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure. First, two independent PCR reactions were carried out in which the cDNA sequences (that encode amino- and carboxyl-terminal sequences around AID of the full-length I-IIA loop) were amplified with the use of chimera AID oligonucleotide sequences. Second, a final PCR reaction was carried out after annealing of the two initial PCR products by their AID sequences. The final PCR product was subcloned in pGEX2TK vector by the use of BamHI and EcoRI sites that were present in the most extreme 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotides. The following internal chimeric oligonucleotides were used: 1) for AIDS chimera, forward: 5′-CGTGATCCAGCTCATGTAGCCCCGAAGGTCCTCCTCCAGCTGCTGCTGCCGCCGCAG-3′, reverse: 5′-CTTCGGGGCTACATGAGCTGGATCACGCAGGGCGAGGAGGTGATCCTCGCAGAGGAC-3′; 2) for AIDB chimera, forward: 5′-GAAGATCCACTCCAAGTACCCATTCAGTTCTCGCTCAATCTGCTGCTGCCGCCGCAG-3′, reverse: 5′-CTGAATGGGTACTTGGAGTGGATCTTCAAGGCGGAGGAGGTGATCCTCGCAGAGGAC-3′; and 3) for AIDC/D chimera, forward: 5′-AGTGATCCAGTCCAGGTAGCCTTTGAGGTCCTCTTCCAGCTGCTGCTGCCGCCGCAG-5′, reverse: 5′-CTCAAAGGCTACCTGGACTGGATCACTCAGGCAGAAGAGGTGATCCTCGCAGAGGAC-3′. The extreme 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides were derived from the Cav2.1 cDNA sequence (GenBank accession no. X57477): forward, base pairs 1374–1415; and reverse, base pairs 1709–1754. Mutations in the AIDA cDNA sequence were performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were performed directly on the wild-type I-IIAloop itself subcloned in the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX2TK vector. Mutagenic primers extended from Cav2.1 base pairs: 1428–1466 (I385L), 1434–1472 (R387E), 1437–1475 (E388D), 1443–1481 (N390K), 1452–1489 (M393L), 1455–1491 (E394D), 1464–1502 (S397T), and 1465–1507 (K398Q). Next, the 1416–1723 BsmI fragment encoding the wild-type AID motif in Cav2.1 (pSP72 vector) was replaced by chimeric and mutated AID sequences. To facilitate cloning, the thirdBsmI site in the 3′ noncoding region was deleted by digestion of the BamHI-EcoRI fragments of the noncoding region, followed by recircularization of the plasmid. The chimeric and mutated regions were sequenced in both directions on an Automated Sequencer (ABI PRISM model 310, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The pcDNA3.1/His-C (Invitrogen) construct containing the sequence of the I-IIA loop was as described previously (17Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. De Waard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). For experiments with CD8, we used the α chain of the human CD8 clone, in which the cDNA sequence corresponding to its cytoplasmic part was replaced by Cav2.1 cDNA sequences. The following CD8 constructs were made: 1) CD8-stop with no cytoplasmic sequence, except a Myc tag (CD8 sequence subcloned in the EcoRI andBamHI sites of pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His A (Invitrogen) with forward primer: 5′-CCGGAATTCACCATGGCCTTACCAGTGACCGCCTTGCTCCTGCCGCTG-3′ and reverse primer: 5′-CGCGGATCCCCTGTGGTTGCAGTAAAGGGTGATAACCAGTGACAGCAG-3′); 2) CD8-NtA (amino acids 1–98), subcloned as previously described for the I-IIA loop in the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pcDNA3-CD8-βARK-Myc vector (17Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. De Waard M.

Stage V or VI oocytes, fromXenopus laevis frogs, were microinjected with a nanoliter injector (WPI) using 40–50 nl of various cRNA mixtures (0.3 μg/μl wild-type, chimera or mutant Cav2.1 ± 0.1 μg/μl β4 subunit or various αCD8 chimeras; CD8-NTA, CD8-I-IIA, CD8-II-IIIA, CD8-III-IVA, CD8-CT1A, or CD8-CT2A). Some cells were also coinjected with a mixture of wild-type or mutant Cav2.1 cRNA and III-IVAor control peptide. The final concentration of the peptides reached in the cells was 10 μm. Cells were incubated in defined nutrient oocyte medium (21Eppig J.J. Dumont J.N. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 418-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for 4–7 days prior to recordings. These cells could be kept for up to 3 weeks in these conditions. Two-electrode voltage clamp was performed with a GeneClamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). The extracellular solution used was as follows (in mm): Ba(OH)2 40, NaOH 50, KCl 3, HEPES 10, niflumic acid 0.5, pH 7.4, with methanesulfonic acid. Electrodes filled with 140 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, and HEPES (pH 7.2) had resistances comprising between 0.5 and 1 megohm. Recordings were filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 5–10 kHz. Leak subtraction was performed on-line by a P/4 protocol. Voltage-dependent activation curves were obtained by measuring the peak current amplitude after cell depolarization from a holding potential of −90 mV. Pulse frequency was every 15 s. For steady-state inactivation curves, cells were depolarized to 20 mV from various holding potentials. New holding potentials were maintained at least 30 s before pulse application. Data were analyzed using pClamp version 6.02 software (Axon Instruments). The chimeras expressed a variable number and proportion of kinetic components precluding a detailed kinetic analysis for a clear comparison in inactivation kinetics. For these reasons, we chose to use half-inactivation time (HIT) values instead of time constants. Metabolic labeling was performed by coinjecting 0.2 μCi of [35S]methionine per oocyte with the cRNA coding for the various CD8-Cav2.1 proteins. After injection, the oocytes were maintained 24 h in Barth's medium (in mm: 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 0.82 MgSO4, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, 2.4 NaHCO3, 15 HEPES, pH 7.4, NaOH). Next, 30 oocytes/condition were resuspended on ice in 1 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, pH 6.8) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and homogenized with a 1-ml Potter homogenizer (Bioblock). The homogenate was incubated at 4 °C for 30 min under agitation, and then centrifuged 20 min at 10,000 × g (AM2.19 rotor, Jouan MR22i). The supernatant was collected with a Pasteur pipette, care being taken to avoid the lipid layer. The 35S-CD8-Cav2.1-Myc proteins were then immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-Myc IgG coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated proteins were loaded on 9–15% SDS-PAGE gel, and the gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography. 35S-Labeled probes were synthesized by coupled in vitro transcription and translation using the TNT™ system (Promega). Nonincorporated [35S]methionine was removed by purification on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Translated proteins were analyzed by loading them onto 5–15% SDS-PAGE gels. Fusion proteins were purified as previously reported (22De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12056-12064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Excess glutathione was removed, first, by the use of a PD10 column, second by dialyzing against PBS buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C (Spectrum, 8000-Da molecular mass cut-off). Purified GST fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-agarose beads by a 30-min incubation in buffer A: Tris-buffered saline (25 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)) plus 0.1% Triton X-100. Residual unbound fusion proteins were removed by a first wash with buffer A. Binding of 35S-I-IIA loop was initiated by the addition of 1–2 μl of the translation product in a 0.5-ml volume of beads/buffer A. Estimated fusion protein concentration was 1 μm. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed four times with 1 ml of buffer A, and the bound radioactive protein analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Nonspecific binding is determined as the radioactivity associated to GST-glutathione-agarose beads. For binding of35S-β4 onto the chimeric GST-I-IIA loops, crude BL21 bacterial extracts were used, incubated with glutathione-agarose beads, unbound material washed with Tris-buffered saline, and binding performed with in vitrotranslated β protein. Several published observations demonstrate that non-l-type andl-type channels differ in the regulation of their inactivation by β subunits (14Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Although β subunits appear to affect the rate of l-type channel inactivation, steady-state inactivation seems to be less dependent on β subunit coexpression than non-l-type channels (9Cens T. Reste S. Galas S. Charnet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5483-5490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18De Waard M. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P.

Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 1117-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These data suggest that there are some intrinsic molecular determinants differing between l-type and non-l-type Cav channels in the control of inactivation by β subunits. As the I-II loop contains the main β binding site, we hypothesized that part of the differences in β regulation of inactivation between these two groups of calcium channels may be attributed to β binding sites. This hypothesis is supported by experimental evidence illustrating that deletions, mutations, or splicing within the I-II loop all modify the kinetics of inactivation (4Bourinet E. Soong T.W.

A close examination of the amino acid residues that constitute the AID sequence of each Cav channel reveals some interesting differences among l- and non-l-type channels (Fig. 1 A). Alignment of the AID sequences illustrates that residue conservation within each subfamily of calcium channels (l- versusnon-l-type) is much higher than previously recognized. AIDC is identical to AIDD (both are thereafter referred to as AIDC/D), whereas AIDS differs by only two residues from AIDC and AIDD. Additionally, AIDA, AIDB, and AIDEdiffer by only three residues at approximately the same location at which differences are found in AIDS, AIDC, and AIDD. More importantly, there are some significant differences in the distribution of charged residues between the two subfamilies of Cav channels. Arg-5 of AIDA is replaced by a Glu residue in l-type AID sequences, whereas Asn-8 and Lys-17 are replaced by Arg/Lys and Gln residues, respectively. To better understand the role of these AID residues in calcium channel inactivation and β-dependent regulation, we made a set of chimeras in which we replaced the AIDA sequence from Cav2.1 (20Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Numa S. Nature. 1991; 350: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) by equivalent AID sequences from Cav1.1, Cav1.2, or Cav1.3 (l-type AID sequences) and from Cav2.2 (non-l-type AID sequences). All chimeric channels were functionally expressed inXenopus oocytes in the presence of the β4subunit with average current densities ranging between 1.2 ± 0.2 and 13.4 ± 2.6 μA/μF (data not shown). We confirmed that β4 was indeed able to bind to the chimera channels by directly testing the interaction of 35S-β4subunit to various crude preparations of chimeric GST-I-IIAfusion proteins (Fig. 1 B). The results illustrated in Fig.1 C confirm that β4 is indeed able to bind to the chimeric sequences. Affinity experiments demonstrate that these interactions occur with an affinity equivalent to that of the wild-type GST-I-IIA linker (data not shown). These data thus show that “nonconserved” AID residues are not essential to the binding of β subunits to the AID sequences. Next, we tested whether the chimeric channels differed in inactivation properties (Fig.2). We compared the inactivation kinetics of wild-type Cav2.1/β4 channels with AID chimeric Cav2.1/β4 channels by measuring the time required for the current elicited at 20 mV to decrease to mid-amplitude. This paradigm was chosen because it allows a reliable comparison between the various channels expressed (see “Experimental Procedures”). The α2δ subunit was omitted from our expression experiments because it modifies inactivation in a β-dependent manner (22De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12056-12064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The data obtained demonstrate that, in the presence of β4, there was no statistical difference in inactivation kinetics between wild-type Cav2.1 and Cav2.1 AIDB channels, a result that is consistent with the close relatedness of their AID sequences. For a membrane potential of 20 mV, average HIT of Cav2.1 is 152 ± 20 ms (n = 13) in this oocyte batch. In contrast, both Cav2.1 AIDS and Cav2.1 AIDC/D presented slower inactivation kinetics than wild-type Cav2.1. The Cav2.1 AIDC/D chimera had the slowest inactivation kinetic with an average HIT value of 775 ± 78 ms (n = 13; slowing factor of 5.1 ± 1.1-fold). These data clearly demonstrate that the AID sequence contributes to the inactivation behavior of Cav2.1 and are in agreement with the observation generally made that l-type channels have slower inactivation kinetics than non-l-type channels. However, one should not interpret these data to mean that the AID sequence is the unique determinant underlying kinetic differences between these channel types. We aimed at identifying the AID amino acids that are responsible for such a drastic kinetic difference between wild-type and chimeric Cav2.1 channels. We focused on the AIDC/D chimera because its inactivation kinetics was the most divergent from that of the wild-type Cav2.1. Fig. 3 Aillustrates several Cav2.1 mutants in which individual nonconserved AIDA residues were replaced by AIDC residues located at equivalent positions. All these mutated AID sequences were able to interact with high affinity with the β4 subunit (data not shown). Coexpression experiments of single mutated Cav2.1 channels with β4 reveal that, except for N390K, most nonconserved residues contribute to the slowing of inactivation observed with the Cav2.1 AIDC/D chimera. The most striking effect was observed with the R387E mutation with an average HIT value of 660 ± 53 ms (n = 12). Very similar observations have been made for this residue by various research groups (25Berrou L. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Herlitze S. Hockerman G.H. Scheuer T Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1512-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, none of these studies extended their investigation to closely positioned AID residues. Although several amino-terminal residues slowed inactivation, the results obtained with the AIDC/D chimera (Fig. 2) suggest that, in this region, the effects of the individual residues are not additive as the HIT value of the R387E mutation approached that of the Cav2.1 AIDC/D chimera. Overall, these data demonstrate that more than one residue contributes to differences in inactivation kinetics between AIDA and AIDC/D. It was th"

Using an “in silico” macromolecular docking approach, we built a model in which malonyl-CoA could be attached near the catalytic core. This disrupts the positioning of the acyl-CoA substrate in the channel in the model reported for both proteins (Morillas, M., Gómez-Puertas, P., Roca, R., Serra, D., Asins, G., Valencia, A., and Hegardt, F. G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 45001–45008). The putative malonyl-CoA domain contained His340, implicated together with His131 in COT malonyl-CoA sensitivity (Morillas, M., Clotet, J., Rubı́, B., Serra, D., Asins, G., Ariño, J., and Hegardt F. G. (2000) FEBS Lett. 466, 183–186). When we mutated COT His131 the IC50increased, and malonyl-CoA competed with the substrate decanoyl-CoA. Mutation of COT Ala332, present in the domain 8 amino acids away from His340, decreased the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of COT. The homologous histidine and alanine residues of L-CPT I, His277, His483, and Ala478 were also mutated, which decreased malonyl-CoA sensitivity. Natural mutation of Pro479, which is also located in the malonyl-CoA predicted site, to Leu in a patient with human L-CPT I hereditary deficiency, modified malonyl-CoA sensitivity. We conclude that this malonyl-CoA domain is present in both COT and L-CPT I proteins and might be the site at which malonyl-CoA interacts with the substrate acyl-CoA. Other malonyl-CoA non-inhibitable members of the family, CPT II and carnitine acetyltransferase, do not contain this domain. Carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) I, which facilitate the transport of medium- and long-chain fatty acids through the peroxisomal and mitochondrial membranes, are physiologically inhibited by malonyl-CoA.

Interest in malonyl-CoA as a metabolic regulator has increased in recent years, as its function is not restricted to liver regulation of fatty acid oxidation and synthesis. Its contribution to the β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in other tissues, such as heart, skeletal muscle, and the β-cell has been widely studied (1.Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In liver, a low insulin/glucagon ratio decreases malonyl-CoA and shifts the fatty acid traffic throughout the oxidative process. The opposite is also true: when the insulin/glucagon ratio increases, malonyl-CoA concentration also rises, followed by a decrease in β-oxidation (2.McGarry J.D. Foster D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 395-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar,3.McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The situation is similar in rat heart: incubation of perfused rat heart with glucose and insulin raises malonyl-CoA concentrations with concomitant suppression of palmitate oxidation (4.Saddik M. Gamble J. Witters L.A. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25836-25845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the glucose concentration in β-cell is raised, the malonyl-CoA concentration also increases and the resulting elevation of cytosolic long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs concentration stimulates exocytosis of insulin granules (5.Corkey B.E.

Malonyl-CoA acquires its significant regulatory role by virtue of its inhibition of a class of carnitine acyltransferases, carnitine octanoyltransferase (COT) 1The abbreviations used are: COTcarnitine octanoyltransferaseCPT Icarnitine palmitoyltransferase IL-CPT Iliver isoform of CPT IM-CPT Imuscle isoform of CPT ICPT IIcarnitine palmitoyltransferase IICATcarnitine acetyltransferaseCoAcoenzyme A and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT) I. There are two isoforms of CPT I, produced by different genes: the L (liver) type and the M (muscle) type. In mammals, muscle CPT I has a much lower IC50 for malonyl-CoA than the liver form, whereas the affinity for long chain acyl-CoA is similar (7.Saggerson E.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8.McGarry J.D. Mills S.E. Long C.S. Foster D.W. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). This differential response to malonyl-CoA has been associated with the distinct interaction between the NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of the protein, which are exposed to the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial membrane (9.Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, other members of the family, such as carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) and carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT) are not regulated by malonyl-CoA (10.McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J.

Inhibition by malonyl-CoA is produced by the occurrence of two binding sites, present in both L- and M- types (17.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One site is the low affinity site, near the catalytic acyl-CoA-binding domain, in which the inhibitory effect could be exerted by malonyl-CoA and, a lesser extent, other compounds with the CoA moiety, such as acetyl-CoA, glutaryl-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, methylmalonyl-CoA or free CoA itself (19.a′Bhaird N.

The second, high affinity site is separated from the active site and does not compete with acyl-CoA (21.Bird M.I. Saggerson E.D. Biochem.

Compounds analog to malonyl-CoA, like 4-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate or its derivative Ro 25–0187, could inhibit CPT I without the presence of the CoA moiety (23.Kashfi K. Mynatt R.L. Cook G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The probable locations of the malonyl-CoA-binding sites in L-CPT I were predicted to be at the cytosolic COOH-terminal domain, after the preparation of several L-CPT I chimeras (26.Swanson S.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27.Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38410-38416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the NH2 terminus of L-CPT I also influences the enzyme-inhibitor interaction, since mutation of either His5or Glu3 reduced malonyl-CoA sensitivity (17.Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9421-9426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 26.Swanson S.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, modification of the interaction between the cytosolic NH2-terminal domain and the cytosolic catalytic COOH-terminal domain of CPT I alters the IC50 values for malonyl-CoA (9.Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, the removal of the segment comprised between amino acids 19 and 40 increases malonyl-CoA sensitivity in L-CPT I, which emphasizes the importance of the NH2terminus before the first transmembrane region as a modulator of malonyl-CoA inhibition (27.Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38410-38416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28.Jackon V.N. Price N.T. Zammit V.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14629-14634Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The possible influence on malonyl-CoA inhibition of amino acids in the NH2 terminus does not occur in COT protein because the first amino acid of COT corresponds to position 152 of the L-CPT I, and therefore COT does not have the same amino terminus nor the transmembrane domains. Histidine residues are implicated in the malonyl-CoA interaction by the finding that a decrease in pH (associated with the protonation of the imidazol group of histidine) increases the affinity for malonyl-CoA (12.Saggerson E.D. Carpenter C.A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 132: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29.Stephens T.W. Cook G.A. Harris R.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Our previous work showed that COT-malonyl-CoA interactions implicated two histidine residues, His131 and His340, which could involve two domains of interaction and binding of malonyl-CoA (30.Morillas M. Clotet J. Rubı́ B. Serra D. Asins G. Ariño J. Hegardt F.G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The proposal of a structural model of the catalytic core of the COT protein (31.Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45001-45008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), in which one of these histidines, His340, is located has facilitated the study of one of these malonyl-CoA affinity domains. In this study we identified a putative binding domain of malonyl-CoA located in the model of COT and L-CPT I. From bioinformatic and mutagenic analysis, we define a domain containing amino acids from Ala332 to His340 in COT, and from Ala478 to His483 in L-CPT I (its homologous domain) as the site at which malonyl-CoA could bind to with either protein and induce inhibition. The structural models of COT and L-CPT I locate malonyl-CoA near the catalytic channel. The presence of malonyl-CoA in the groove of ligand-protein interaction would interfere with the positioning of the substrate decanoyl-CoA (in COT) or palmitoyl-CoA (in L-CPT I). To confirm this model, we expressed the cDNA for the wild type and different single and double mutants of COT and L-CPT I in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A similar picture to that proposed for COT and L-CPT I is impossible with the non-inhibitable malonyl-CoA enzymes CPT II or CAT, although they have the same three-dimensional structure (which is analogous to the 2dubE domain described for COT and L-CPT I), since when we use a docking program, malonyl-CoA cannot be located in the model. Structural models of rat CPT I and COT were obtained as previously described (31.Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol.

Calculation and representation of electrostatic potentials of the obtained models were performed using GRASP (50.Nicholls A. Bharadwaj R. Honig B. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: A166Google Scholar). Docking calculations to obtain a molecular model of the interaction between the inhibitor (ligand) malonyl-CoA and the putative receptor proteins CPT I, COT, CPT II, and CAT were performed using the spherical polar Fourier correlations based program “Hex” (51.Ritchie D.W. Kemp G.J.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 39: 178-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the malonyl-CoA molecule were obtained from the PDB entry 1hnj(three-dimensional structure of the β-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III). Program parameters were adjusted to evaluate the docking score at more than 40,000 distinct rotational orientations at each of 10 different intermolecular distances (at increments of ± 1 Å) between the inhibitor molecule and the molecular models of the four acyltransferases indicated above. The 128 highest scoring (lowest energy) orientations were retained for viewing and evaluation. Conserved differences (tree-determinants) between malonyl-inhibitable (L-CPT I, M-CPT I, COT) and non-inhibitable (CPT II, CAT) carnitine acyltransferases were analyzed with the SequenceSpace algorithm (52.Casari G.

Plasmids pYESCOTwt, pYESCOTH131A, pYESCOTH340A, and pYESCOTH131A/H340A were obtained as previously described (54.Morillas M. Clotet J. Rubı́ B. Serra D. Ariño J. Hegardt F.G. Asins G. Biochem.

Plasmid pYESCOTA332Gwas constructed using the QuikChange polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene) with the pYESCOTwtplasmid as template and the primer 5′-GCTGTGATCATGCTCCTTATGATGGAATGCTTATGGTGAAC-3′ (the mutated nucleotide is underlined). Plasmid pYESLCPTIwt, which contained nucleotides 103–2701 including the coding region of L-CPT was constructed as described (31.Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A.

Plasmid pYESLCPTIwt was used for site-directed mutagenesis of His277 to Ala277 by the asymmetric PCR method (55.Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The following primers were used: the mutated megaprimer fragment, obtained with the forward primer CPT583.for: 5′-AGCCCATGTTGTACAGCTTCC-3′ and the reverse primer H277A.rev: 5′-AGTATGGCGGCGATGGTGTTGCCAGC-3′ (the mutated nucleotides are underlined), was used with the reverse primer CPT1607.rev: 5′-CCATCCTCTGAGTAACCCAGC-3′. The fragment obtained was digested with AatII (nucleotides 610–1580) and subcloned into the plasmid pYESLCPTIwt, obtaining plasmid pYESLCPTIH277A. Plasmid pBSLCPTIwt, which contained nucleotides 54–2701 of rat L-CPT I subcloned in the ClaI and EcoRI sites of pBluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene), was used for construction of plasmid pYESLCPTIH483A. The mutated megaprimer fragment was obtained with the forward primer H483A.for: 5′-GTGGGCGCTTTGTGGGAGTATGTCATGGC-3′ (the mutated nucleotides are underlined) and the reverse primer CPT1878.rev: 5′-GGCCTCATATGTGAGGC-3′, which was used with the primer CPT1182.for: 5′-GCAGCAGATGCAGCAGATCC-3′ to obtain a fragment which, after digestion with PstI, was subcloned into the pBSLCPTIwt, obtaining pBSLCPTIH483A. To obtain the plasmid pYESCPTIH483A, the fragment KpnI-EcoRI was digested and subcloned into the pYESCPTIwt. Plasmid pYESLCPTIH277A/H483A was generated by mutagenesis of His277 to Ala using the plasmid pYESLCPTIH483A as template, and the primers described above. Mutant L-CPT I A478G was constructed using the “QuikChange” polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis procedure (Stratagene) with pYESLCPTIwt plasmid as template and the primer 5′-CACTCCTGCGCGGACGGGCCCATCGTGGGCCATTTG-3′(mutated nucleotide is underlined). The appropriate substitutions, as well as the absence of unwanted mutations were confirmed by sequencing the inserts in both directions with an Applied Biosystems 373 automated DNA sequencer. The expression of the constructs containing COT and L-CPT I wild type and mutants (see above) in yeast cells and the obtaining of the cell extracts were performed as described in Refs. 30.Morillas M.

Depending on the experiment the time to induce expression of L-CPT I by galactose was varied between 1 and 20 h. Carnitine acyltransferase activity was determined by the radiometric method as described in Ref. 26.Swanson S.T. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Biochem.

Enzyme activity was assayed for 4 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 200 μl. For determination of the Km for carnitine, decanoyl-CoA was fixed at 50 μm (for COT) and palmitoyl-CoA was fixed at 135 μm (for L-CPT I). For determination of the Km for acyl-CoA, carnitine concentration was fixed at 400 μm. When malonyl-CoA inhibition was assayed, increasing concentrations of malonyl-CoA were included. The IC50, defined as the malonyl-CoA concentration that produces 50% inhibition of enzyme activity, was determined using 50 μm acyl-CoA and 400 μmcarnitine. Km was estimated by analyzing the data from three experiments using the program Enzifit (Biosoft) and IC50 was calculated by Excel software using linear regression analysis. Values reported in the text are the means and standard deviations of three to five determinations. Curve fitting was carried out using Sigma plot software. All protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine albumin as standard. Western blot analysis for COT and L-CPT I were performed as described (31.Morillas M.

The specific antibody used for rat COT was directed against peptide 344–360. The antibody for rat L-CPT I was kindly given by Dr. V. A. Zammit (Hannah Research Institute, Ayr, Scotland, United Kingdom) and was directed against peptide 428–441, in the cytosolic catalytic COOH-terminal domain. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated as described elsewhere (56.Derrick P. Ramsay R.R. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were dispersed in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA to a final concentration of 40 mg/ml and stored at −70 °C. Once the structural models of COT and L-CPT I catalytic core, including the putative substrate-binding site, active site, were established (31.Morillas M. Gómez-Puertas P. Roca R. Serra D. Asins G. Valencia A. Hegardt F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45001-45008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we performed exhaustive in silico molecular docking analysis to find clues to the putative binding site of malonyl-CoA. We used the computational system Hex (51.Ritchie D.W. Kemp G.J.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 39: 178-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) that uses spherical polar Fourier correlations. Each molecule was modeled using three-dimensional parametric functions which encode both surface shape and electrostatic charge and electrostatic potential distributions. By using an expression for the overlap of pairs of parametric functions, an expression for a docking score can be derived as a function of the six degrees of freedom in a rigid body docking search. With the appropriate scaling factors, the docking score can be interpreted as an interaction energy that ranks possible docking solutions according to the minimum value. After analysis of the best (minimum energy) solutions given by the program for the interaction between the malonyl-CoA molecule and the structural model for the catalytic core of rat COT, a common position was observed for the five best predicted solutions in terms of low energy of the complex and lowest macromolecular distance. The lowest distance solution is shown in Fig. 1A. The inhibitor molecule fits into a second cavity in the three-dimensional model, which is distinct from the cavity occupied by the substrate. The simultaneous representation of both molecules (decanoyl-CoA (substrate) and malonyl-CoA (inhibitor), (Fig. 1B) offers an explanation for the inhibition process: both molecules compete for a portion of the same spatial groove, despite the different binding site proposed in the model. To analyze the fitting of malonyl-CoA on the surface of the protein, and to improve our definition of this domain, we have performed a site-directed mutagenesis in some of the amino acids involved in this domain. If site-directed mutants show decreased sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, the precise location of this molecule in the COT model would be supported. We expressed COT wild type in S. cerevisiae, an organism devoid of endogenous COT activity, and determined the influence of the concentration of the acyl-CoA substrate, decanoyl-CoA, on the inhibitory pattern produced by malonyl-CoA. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was a competition in COT wild type between the acyl-CoA and the inhibitor, since when the concentration of decanoyl-CoA increased from 5 to 50 or 200 μm, the curves are similar, but the IC50values rose from 3.3 to 76 or 581 μm. We then expressed the COT H131A mutant and compared the kinetics of malonyl-CoA inhibition of this mutant with that of the double mutant H131A/H340A (Fig. 2B). The result of these comparisons shows the particular responsibility of COT His340 in the inhibition. Whereas the double mutant is not inhibited at any malonyl-CoA concentration (1–200 μm), the inhibition of mutant COT H131A was dependent on the concentration of the substrate. A low decanoyl-CoA concentration (5 μm) gives low IC50 values for malonyl-CoA (36 μm). When the substrate concentration is increased to 50 μm or 200 μm the IC50 values increase in a sigmoid kinetic, so that the IC50 values were not calculated. These results implicate His340 in malonyl-CoA inhibition, which was competitive between substrate and inhibitor. They are also consistent with the COT structural model, in which decanoyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA exclude each other. To confirm the model presented in Fig. 1, we mutated another amino acid, in the COT malonyl-CoA domain, to see whether the sensitivity to the inhibitor was modified. COT Ala332 is 8 amino acids away from His340 and therefore could participate in the inhibitory process. Two considerations supported this choice. On the one hand, Ala332 is the first amino acid after the acidic residue (aspartic or glutamic) common to carnitine octanoyl- and palmitoyltransferases (Fig. 3, right). On the other hand, as shown by the tree-determinant analysis of the multiple alignment of the acyltransferase family, alanines at this position are present in all malonyl-CoA inhibitable carnitine acyltransferases (COT and L-CPT I) but absent in non-malonyl-CoA inhibitable carnitine acyltransferases (CPT II and CAT), where they are substituted by glycine. Therefore, we prepared the mutant COT A332G and expressed it in S. cerevisiae. The mutated protein had the same molecular mass as the wild type and was expressed at the same levels (Fig. 4). Moreover, the kinetics toward both carnitine and decanoyl-CoA, were similar to wild type, with normal saturation behavior (Table I). The mutant was measu"
https://openalex.org/W2023399286,"Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) is the key enzyme for gastric histamine synthesis, and enhanced HDC expression is critically involved in the pathogenesis of gastric disorders, including gastroduodenal ulcer disease. We characterized the pathogenicity mechanism underlying activation of the HDC promoter in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells and performed a detailed analysis of the participating signaling elements. We found that H. pylori infection of gastric epithelial cells activated the MEK1-2/ERK1-2 cascade through cAMP-dependent stimulation of Rap1 and B-Raf, but not Ras/c-Raf-1, leading to potent transactivation of the human HDC promoter. H. pylori-triggered elevation of adenylate cyclase activity was directed by GalphaS-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Stimulation of this signaling cascade was triggered independent of bacterial-cell contact by a small molecular- weight component(s) (approximately 1 kDa) released by H. pylori and did not require a functional type IV secretion system. Thus, our studies demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge that the GalphaS-->cAMP-->Rap1--->B-Raf-->MEK1/2-->ERK1/2 pathway is critical for H. pylori-dependent epithelial gene regulation, which can be induced via a bioactive component(s) apart from the site of bacterial colonization. These results further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying interaction of H. pylori with gastric epithelial cells and help to define potential molecular targets for therapeutic interventions in the context of H. pylori-related gastric diseases."

We transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with rab4, the GTPase-deficient mutant rab4Q67L, and the dominant negative mutant rab4S22N that poorly binds guanine nucleotides. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that rab4 was concentrated on internal structures at the lateral side of the cell around the nucleus. Quantitative immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the majority of rab4 was localized in the upper third of the cytoplasm. In cell surface binding experiments with<sup>125</sup>I-transferrin, we found a redistribution of transferrin receptor from the basolateral to the apical plasma membrane in cells expressing rab4 and rab4Q67L. After accumulation of transferrin at 16 °C in basolateral early endosomes, rab4 and rab4Q67L increased the amount of apically targeted transferrin receptor. A qualitatively similar effect was obtained in control cells treated with brefeldin A. The effects of brefeldin A and rab4 on apical targeting of transferrin receptor were not additive, suggesting that brefeldin A and rab4 may act in the same transport pathway from common endosomes."

Upon docking with the ER membrane, many proteins are co-translationally inserted into the ER lumen via a ribosome-translocon channel that includes the heterotrimeric Sec61p complex and the translocating chain-associating membrane protein (10.Jungnickel B.

The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes two ER-resident membrane glycoproteins, US2 and US11, that each destabilize major histocompatibility class I molecules (18.Tortorella D. Gewurz B.E.

The 199-residue US2 glycoprotein contains an ER-lumenal portion, a predicted single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 1). US2 recognizes class I molecules via an immunoglobulin-like fold that attaches to the class I ER-lumenal domain (19.Gewurz B.E. Gaudet R. Tortorella D. Wang E.W. Ploegh H.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl.

The mechanism of ER dislocation and degradation is not clearly understood. HCMV US2 and US11 exhibit unusual characteristics concerning their ER processing events.

The human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK-293) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5% calf serum. Polyclonal antisera generated against US2 and class I heavy chains were generated as described (23.Tortorella D. Story C.M. Huppa J.B. Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Bacik I. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cDNA of full-length US2 (amino acids 1–199) was cloned from the AD169 HCMV genome into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). US2 truncation mutants, US220–199 (aa 20–199) and US21–160 (aa 1–160) were subcloned from US2 (pCDNA 3.1) by PCR and inserted into pcDN3.1. Major histocompatibility class I (HLA-A2) heavy chain lacking a signal sequence (HC25–365) was subcloned from HLA-A2 (pcDNA3.1) by PCR and inserted into pcDNA3.1. The H-2Kb/US2 chimeras, Kb1–5/US27–199 (H-2Kb(aa 1–5)/US2 (aa 7–199)) and Kb1–16/US217–199((H-2Kb (aa 1–16)/US2 (aa 17–199)), and US2/HLA-A2 chimeras, US21–20/HC25–365 ((US2 (aa 1–20)/HLA-A2 (aa 25–365)), US21–25/HC25-365 (US2 (aa 1–25)/HLA-A2 (aa 25–365)), US21–30/HC25–365 (US2 (aa 1–30)/HLA-A2 (aa 25–365)), US21–35/HC25–365 (US2 (aa 1–35)/HLA-A2 (aa 25–365)), US21–40/HC25–365(US2 (aa 1–40)/HLA-A2 (aa 25–365)), were generated by amplifying the appropriate fragment by PCR followed by ligation of two of the respective fragments. Using specific primers to the sense and antisense strand of the ligated product, the chimeric cDNAs were amplified by PCR, phosphorylated with T4 DNA kinase, and inserted into pCDNA 3.1. The H-2Kb/US2 chimeric mutant, Kb1–21/US221–199(H-2Kb(aa 1–21)/US2(aa 21–199)) was generated by amplifying the US2 cDNA that corresponds to aa 21–199 by PCR. This truncated US2 was ligated to the murine H2 class I heavy chain Kb signal sequence (H-2Kb residues 1–21) (pSP72 (Invitrogen)) (24.Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Kb1–21/US221–199 cDNA was then shuttled into pCDNA 3.1. Lipid-mediated transient (HEK-293 cells) and stable (U373-MG cells) transfections were performed as described by the manufacturer (5 μg of DNA/15 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) were used per transfection). Cells were released from tissue culture flasks by trypsinization and incubated in cysteine/methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were metabolically labeled with 500 μCi of [35S]cysteine/methionine (1200 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) at 37 oC for the indicated times. Pulse-chase experiments and immunoprecipitation were performed as previously described (21.Rehm A. Stern P. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Digestion with endoglycosidase H (EndoH) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was performed on immunoprecipitated complexes according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography/autoradiography (25.Ploegh H.L. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. Wiley, New York1995Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription and translation of US21–199 were performed as described (26.Furman M.H. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3258-3267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The subcellular fractionation and Na2CO3 treatment were performed as previously described, respectively (21.Rehm A. Stern P. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1573-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Urea treatment of homogenates prepared from HEK-293 transfectants was performed in a similar manner as Na2CO3 treatment, except 4.5 m urea was used. Following SDS-gel electrophoresis, US2 was transferred from the polyacrylamide gel to a Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 mm) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Labconco, Seattle, WA). The glycosylated US2 polypeptide was excised from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to automated Edman degradation. An Applied Biosystem Protein Sequencer, Model 477, using ATZ chemistry, at the Biopolymers Laboratory at MIT, Center for Cancer Research was utilized. The fractions from each degradation cycle were collected and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The nonpolar region present at the US2 COOH terminus likely constitutes a membrane anchor (Fig. 1), consistent with earlier proposals for the topology of US21–199 (19.Gewurz B.E. Gaudet R. Tortorella D. Wang E.W. Ploegh H.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6794-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20.Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). To establish more directly the membrane disposition of US2, Na2CO3 extraction was performed on homogenates of metabolically labeled ([35S]methionine) US21–199 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Treatment of cellular homogenates with Na2CO3releases soluble and peripheral membrane proteins, while transmembrane proteins remain inserted in the lipid bilayer. The membrane pellet (P) and soluble (S) fractions from Na2CO3-treated homogenates were separated by centrifugation (150,000 ×g), followed by recovery of either US21–199(Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3) or the soluble protein β2-microglobulin (β2m) (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6) by anti-US2 and anti-β2m serum, respectively. Whereas N-linked glycosylated US21–199 molecules were recovered exclusively from the insoluble, sedimentable fraction (Fig. 2A, lane 3), β2m molecules were present only in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2A, lane 5). We conclude that US21–199 is a membrane protein. N-Linked glycosylation was examined to further assess the topology of US21–199. It contains consensus N-linked glycan attachment sequons at residues 68–70, 172–174, and 188–190 (Fig. 1); the latter two are within the predicted transmembrane anchor and cytoplasmic tail, respectively. To determine the number of glycosylation sites utilized in vivo, US2 immunoprecipitates were treated with varying amounts of EndoH. Independently of enzyme concentration, EndoH treatment produces a single novel polypeptide, whose mass is reduced by ∼4 kDa, consistent with the presence of a single N-linked glycan on US2 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, US2 deletion mutants that lack the two COOH-terminal glycosylation sequons are glycosylated in a similar manner in transfectants (Fig. 5). We conclude that a single N-linked glycan is attached at asparagine 68, present in a loop between the B and C β-strands of the US2 Ig-like fold (Fig. 6A) (19.Gewurz B.E. Gaudet R. Tortorella D.

US21–199 (lanes 1–3), US21–160 (lanes 4–6), and β2m (lanes 7–9) were recovered directly from cell lysates (−) (lanes 1, 4, and 7), from the 100 mm Na2CO3 or 4.5m 150,000 × g supernatant (S) (lanes 2, 5, and 8) and from the 100 mmNa2CO3 or 4.5 m urea 150,000 × K pellet (P) (lanes 3, 6, and 9), respectively, using the respective sera and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15%). CHO, carbohydrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) US2 polypeptides that differ by the presence of the single N-linked glycan are recovered from lysates of metabolically labeled US21–199 cells (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the non-glycosylated species arises as a deglycosylated degradation intermediate produced in the course of a dislocation reaction (20.Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), pulse-chase experiments were performed on US21–199 cells in the presence and absence of the proteasome inhibitor, ZL3VS (27.Bogyo M. McMaster J.S. Gaczynska M. Tortorella D. Goldberg A.L. Ploegh H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6629-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). US2 molecules were recovered from cell lysates and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). The recovery of glycosylated and non-glycosylated US2 polypeptides decreases at the later chase times both in the presence or absence of ZL3VS (Fig. 3A), but as expected, the degradation rate of non-glycosylated US21–199 is slower in the presence of proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1–4 and 5–8). We observed no evidence for a precursor-product relationship for glycosylated and non-glycosylated US2 polypeptides. We infer that the non-glycosylated US2 polypeptide does not arise as a degradation intermediate. Non-glycosylated US2 could result either from incomplete ER insertion or inefficient glycosylation. To distinguish between these possibilities, the localization of non-glycosylated US2 was determined by subcellular fractionation. Metabolically labeled US21–199 cells were homogenized by mechanical disruption, followed by differential centrifugation (Fig. 3B). The 100,000 × g supernatant (S) contains cytosolic proteins, while the 100,000 × g pellet (P) contains the microsomal fraction. Glycosylated US2 is recovered exclusively from the 100,000 × g pellet (P) (Fig. 3B, lane 4), indicative of its membrane disposition. However, the bulk of the non-glycosylated US2 polypeptide is recovered from the cytosolic fraction, with only a minor fraction co-sedimenting with the microsomal fraction (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). The cytosolic form of US2 is probably material that did not insert into the ER. The interaction of US2 with a membrane protein, possibly through its signal peptide, may account for the association of non-glycosylated US2 with the microsomal fraction. A subpopulation of non-glycosylated US2 continues to co-sediment with the microsomal fraction upon Na2CO3extraction. 2B. E. Gewurz, H. L. Ploegh, and D. Tortorella, unpublished data. These results fail to resolve completely the source of non-glycosylated US2. However, in the absence of a precursor-product relationship for glycosylated and non-glycosylated US2 in the presence and absence of proteasome inhibition, we favor the notion that membrane insertion, and hence N-linked glycosylation, did not occur for non-glycosylated US2. The SignalP computer algorithm (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/index.html) predicts a US2 NH2-terminal signal peptide with probable cleavage site between residues 20 and 21. However, most signal peptides exhibit greater hydrophobicity than that present at the US2 NH2terminus (Fig. 1) (14.Nilsson I. Whitley P. von Heijne G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the US2 NH2 terminus corresponds to a bona fide signal peptide. An NH2-terminal truncation mutant that lacks the NH2-terminal 20 residues (US220–199) was stably transfected into U373 cells and examined for ER insertion by the acquisition of the N-linked glycan. US2 molecules were recovered from SDS-treated lysates of metabolically labeled US21–199 and US220–199 cells using anti-US2 serum. Half of the US2 immunoprecipitates were treated with EndoH and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A). In contrast to US21–199, the US220–199 polypeptides recovered from cell lysates were not glycosylated, as judged from their resistance to EndoH, and were of a size consistent with that of the predicted non-glycosylated polypeptide (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 4). Subcellular fractionation likewise indicated that US220–199 molecules localize to the cytosol (Fig. 4B). Nearly all of the US220–199 molecules were recovered from the 100,000 × g supernatant (S) fraction (Fig. 4B, lane 3). In contrast, a major population of the US2 chimera that contains the signal peptide of murine H-2Kb as the replacement for residues 1–20 of US2 (Kb1–21/US221–199) was inserted into the ER (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6). Not only does the 21-residue signal sequence of murine H-2Kb class I heavy chain drive the ER insertion of US220–199 (as evidenced by EndoH sensitivity of the Kb1–21/US221–199 chimera (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6)), the glycosylated Kb1–21/US221–199 species (Fig. 4A, lane 5, upper band) also has a faster electrophoretic mobility than glycosylated US21–199(Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 5). This difference in mobility between US21–199 and Kb1–21/US221–199 is also observed when the N-linked glycans are removed by EndoH treatment (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 2 and 6). This result was altogether unexpected and suggests that the US21–199 molecule fully retains its NH2-terminal signal peptide. Consistent with this possibility, US2 translated in vitro in the absence of microsomal membranes (Fig. 4C, lane 1) co-migrates with EndoH-treated US2 molecules translated in the presence of microsomes (Fig. 4C, lane 3). To confirm the absence of signal peptide cleavage for US2, NH2-terminal sequencing was carried out on glycosylated US2 molecules recovered from metabolically labeled cellular transfectants (Fig. 4D). The major peak of radioactivity is observed at position one, with a smaller amount of radioactivity released at position 15, consistent with methionines present in the US2 sequence at residues 1 and 15 (Fig. 1). We conclude that US2 fully retains its NH2 terminus following ER insertion. A type I membrane protein that lacks an NH2-terminal signal sequence is without precedent. Internal hydrophobic domains can serve as internal signal peptides as well as stop transfer sequences. Such hydrophobic domains are observed in most proteins that lack a cleavable signal sequence. Is it possible that the putative transmembrane domain (Fig. 1, aa 161–185) of US21–199 can act as a signal peptide? We constructed a US2 COOH-terminal deletion mutant (US21–160) and examined its ability to insert into ER. We used glycosylation of US21–160 as a marker for ER insertion. U373 cells that stably express US21–160 still show efficient glycosylation of US21–160 (Fig. 5). The elimination of the putative transmembrane segment does not interfere with ER insertion of US2 and therefore the US2 contains an NH2-terminal signal peptide. A Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot of US21–199 demonstrates hydrophobic segments at the NH2 terminus (residues 1–20) and between residues 110 and 130, in addition to the putative transmembrane domain (Fig. 1). Can these hydrophobic domains act as additional membrane anchors? The crystal structure of the US2/class I complex shows that residues 110–130 comprise the F and G β-strands of the US2 Ig-like fold, indeed forming an important part of the class I binding surface (Fig. 6A) (19.Gewurz B.E. Gaudet R. Tortorella D. Wang E.W. Ploegh H.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6794-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, this hydrophobic segment resides within the ER lumen. Consistent with this data, an additional N-linked glycosylation sequon introduced at position 149 is efficiently utilized (supplemental Fig. 1). Since this US2 mutant acquires N-linked glycans at positions 68 and 149, the intervening segment must also be present in the ER. Together, these results demonstrate that US2 residues 110–130 do not traverse the membrane bilayer and are consistent with a type I topology for US2. We next examined the cellular disposition of US21–160 to determine whether the uncleaved NH2-terminal signal peptide of US2 is a membrane anchor. US21–199, US21–160, and β2m were recovered from the 150,000 × g membrane pellet (P) and soluble (S) fractions of Na2CO3-treated homogenates of HEK-293-transfected cells (Fig. 6B). The membrane protein US21–199 (Fig. 6B, lanes 1–3) was recovered exclusively from the membrane fraction (P) of Na2CO3-treated homogenates (Fig. 6B, lane 3). In contrast, the soluble protein β2m (Fig. 6B, lanes 7–9) was recovered exclusively from the soluble fraction (S) of Na2CO3-treated homogenates (Fig. 6B, lane 8). In Na2CO3-treated homogenates, US21–160 is mostly recovered from the pellet fraction (P) (Fig. 6B, lane 6), while a small population of US21–160 molecules was recovered from the soluble fraction (S) (Fig. 6B, lane 5). Since protein-protein interactions can survive Na2CO3 treatment (28.Soriano S. Thomas S. High S. Griffiths G. D'Santos C. Cullen P. Banting G. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 579-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,29.Miller J.D. Tajima S. Lauffer L. Walter P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and could allow US2 to partition with the pellet fraction, US21–160 homogenates were treated with the weak denaturant 4.5 m urea (Fig. 6C) as an alternative to Na2CO3 treatment. Nearly all of the US21–160 molecules were recovered from the soluble (S) fraction upon urea treatment (Fig. 6C, lane 5). These results suggest that protein-protein interactions tether US21–160 to the ER membrane and that US21–160is itself a soluble protein. Note that the membrane protein US21–199 (Fig. 6C, lanes 1–3) is not released even to the slightest extent into the soluble fraction upon urea treatment (Fig. 6C, lane 2). The SignalP algorithm was used to predict the n-, h-, and c-regions of both the putative US2 and H-2Kb signal peptides. To determine which region of US2's signal peptide is responsible for the observed lack of signal peptide cleavage, we replaced the predicted US2 n, n + h, or n + h + c regions with the corresponding regions of the H-2Kbsignal peptide (Fig. 7A). US2 chimeras that contain the Kb n-region in place of the putative US2 n-region (Kb1–5/US27–199) are poorly inserted in the ER within these transfectants (Fig. 7B, lanes 3 and 4). Chimeras that contain the putative n + h-region of H-2Kb(Kb1–16/US217–199) are efficiently glycosylated (Fig. 7B, lanes 5 and 6). Despite efficient ER translocation and glycosylation, the hybrid Kb1–16/US217–199signal peptide apparently remains uncleaved following ER insertion (Fig. 7B, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, chimeras that contain the entire H-2Kb signal sequence in place of the US2 20 NH2-terminal residues (Kb1–21/US221–199) are efficiently inserted into the ER with concomitant signal peptide cleavage (Fig. 7B, lanes 7 and 8). For the Kb1–21/US221–199 chimera, its signal peptide appears to be removed, since this product migrates faster than US21–199 and other H-2Kb/US2 chimeras upon SDS-PAGE separation. Thus, elements within the putative US2 signal peptide c-region are responsible for the lack of signal peptide cleavage. To determine whether the US2 NH2 terminus can direct an exogenous membrane protein to the ER, we constructed chimeras comprised of US2 NH2-terminal peptides fused to a reporter type I membrane protein, the major histocompatibility class I (HLA-A2) heavy chain (HC), lacking its own signal peptide (Fig. 8). Since the length of the US2 signal peptide is not precisely known, we generated a series of chimeric proteins that contain either the NH2-terminal 20, 25, 30, 35, or 40 residues of US2 fused to the NH2-ter"
https://openalex.org/W2080950397,"FAP52, a focal adhesion-associated phosphoprotein, is a member of a FAP52/PACSIN/syndapin family of proteins. They share a multidomain structure and are implicated in actin-based and endocytotic functions. We show, by using both native and recombinant proteins, that FAP52 selectively binds to the actin cross-linking protein filamin (ABP-280). This was based on an affinity purification followed by a sequence determination by mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation, overlay binding, and surface plasmon resonance analysis. Binding studies with deletion mutants showed that the sites of the interaction map to the highly α-helical N-terminal part of FAP52 and to the C-terminal region of filamin, which also contains binding sites to some transmembrane signaling proteins. In immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy of cultured fibroblasts, a different overall subcellular distribution was seen for filamin and FAP52 except for a stress fiber-focal adhesion junction where they showed a notable overlap. Overexpression of the full-length and mutant forms of FAP52 led to an extensive reorganization of actin and filamin in cultured fibroblasts. Thus, the results show that FAP52 interacts with filamin, and we propose that this interaction is important in linking and coordinating the events between focal adhesions and the actin cytoskeleton.

They all share a modular structure typified by a well conserved FER-CIP4 homology domain in the very N terminus, followed by a highly α-helical region, and a C-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. In the middle, there is a “linker” region that shows a high degree of sequence variation and does not conform to any specific domain signature. Thus far, no specific function is assigned to FAP52. PACSIN 2, its closest homologue, participates in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and in the regulation of vesicular traffic (5.Modregger J. Ritter B. Witter B. Paulsson M. Plomann M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4511-4521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Syndapin II, on the other hand, along with other syndapin isoforms, is involved in endocytosis and actin dynamics (4.Qualmann B.

In cells overexpressing FAP52, a distinct reorganization of actin and filamin was seen. On the basis of these results we suggest that filamin serves as a link between FAP52 and the actin cytoskeleton and that this interaction is important in linking focal adhesions to actin cytoskeleton. The standard solutions, buffers, and procedures for the purification and precipitation of DNA, restriction enzyme digestions, ligation reactions, SDS-PAGE runs, and stainings were as described in Sambrook et al. (6.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.63-18.57Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was carried out on an automated ABI Prism 377XL DNA Sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) cells, expression vectors pGEX-2T and pGEX-2TK, glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose 4B, thrombin, Rainbow High Molecular Weight Markers, and synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences; isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from MBI Fermentas; Site-directed Mutagenesis kit, Pfupolymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were from Stratagene; restriction enzymes were from MBI Fermentas and Promega Co., and chicken gizzard filamin was from Progen Biotechnik GmbH. For blot overlay (OL) assay, chicken gizzard filamin was purified according to the method of Feramisco and Burridge (7.Feramisco J.R. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1194-1199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection; Immu-Mount mounting medium was from Shandon, Inc.; FuGENE 6 transfection reagent, reduced GSH, protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; ampicillin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and benzamidine were from Sigma; and Triton X-100 was from Merck. Cell culture media and fetal calf serum were from HyClone Laboratories, Inc.; and nitrocellulose (NC) membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to FAP52, denoted Affi-K7, was produced and affinity-purified as described previously (1.Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-filamin antibody was obtained from Chemicon International, Inc.; mouse monoclonal anti-GST and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA epitope antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; rhodamine-phalloidin, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG were from Molecular Probes; mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody and rabbit anti-mouse IgG were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG-agarose, and goat anti-mouse IgG-agarose were purchased from Sigma. For IEM, protein A-gold particles (diameter, 5 and 10 nm), prepared by Slot and Geuze (8.Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar), were used. All the cDNA constructs and the corresponding polypeptides were designated as “FAP52” or “Fil” for FAP52 and filamin, respectively, followed by the subscripted number of the first and the last amino acid (aa) residue expressed. Full-length FAP52 and its fragments were produced as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in BL21(DE3) cells by employing the expression vectors pGEX-2T and pGEX-2TK. The 1.35-kb cDNA encoding the full-length FAP52 was inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI-cloning site in the vector as described previously (1.Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For the cloning and expression of the 3′- and 5′-truncated mutants of FAP52, PCRs with the oligonucleotide primers with add-on sequences for BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites and the full-length cDNA of FAP52 as template were utilized. The resulting cDNAs were cut with the matching restriction enzymes and ligated to BamHI/EcoRI-cut pGEX-2T or pGEX-2TK vectors. For the production of the C-terminal fragments of filamin, pGEX-4T-1 vectors with the cDNAs encoding for the fragments Fil-(1524–2283), Fil-(2283–2490), and Fil-(2495–2647) were employed (a kind gift from Dr. T. P. Stossel, Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston (9.Ohta Y. Suzuki N. Nakamura S. Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2122-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar)). Further C-terminal truncation mutants were generated from the construct encoding for the fragment Fil-(1524–2283) by using a Site-directed Mutagenesis kit and oligonucleotide primers to generate stop codons to appropriate sites of the cDNAs. GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells according to standard protocols, purified from the cell lysates on GSH-Sepharose 4B beads, and liberated from the beads by incubation with reduced GSH. For some experiments, FAP52 or its mutant form was released from its fusion partner by incubation with thrombin. For the control experiments, GST was expressed from the plasmid pGEX-2TK and purified as above. For the expression in cultured animal cells, cDNA constructs encoding the full-length FAP52 or its fragments were produced by PCR with engineered restriction sites. They were cut with EcoRI and EcoRV and subcloned into the EcoRI/EcoRV-cloning site of pRK5 vector (a kind gift from Dr. Joseph Schlessinger, New York University, Medical Center, New York, NY). A hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was engineered to the C terminus of the constructs by primer design. The following constructs were generated: FAP52-HA (FAP52-(1–448) plus HA tag); FAP52Nt-HA (FAP52-(1–293) plus HA tag); and FAP52SH3-HA (FAP52-(390–448) plus HA tag). Cultures of chicken embryo heart fibroblast (CEHF) were established, and the cells were grown as described previously (1.Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown according to the same protocol with the exception that Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was used. For transfections, the cells were grown on glass coverslips to a confluence of 50–70%. Transfections were carried out by using a FuGENE 6 transfection reagent and following the manufacturer's instructions. For IFM, CEHF cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed and stained essentially as described (1.Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In cases with staining of actin filaments, post-fixation was carried out with ethanol for 1 min. As primary antibodies, Affi-K7 (rabbit), rabbit polyclonal anti-HA, mouse monoclonal anti-filamin, or mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin were used at appropriate dilutions. Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies or phalloidin (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG or rhodamine-phalloidin) were applied as secondary antibodies. Viewing was under a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope equipped with a Zeiss Axiovert 110M inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy). The images were processed by using an LSM three-dimensional software, version 5.2 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy). For IEM, CEHF-cells were grown close to confluence. After washing with Hanks' salt solution and fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2.5% sucrose for 1 h, they were harvested with a cell scraper and pelletted. The pellet was resuspended in 2.3 msucrose and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (thickness 80 nm) were cut by using a Leica Ultracut UCT microtome and placed on Butvar-coated nickel grids. They were washed with PBS and blocked with 5% BSA with 0.1% ColdWaterFishSkin gelatin in PBS for 10 min. For double labeling, the sections were first incubated with the monoclonal mouse anti-filamin antibody in 0.1% BSA in PBS (BPBS) for 60 min, followed by an incubation with the rabbit anti-mouse IgG in BPBS for 30 min, and with protein A-gold (diameter, 10 nm) in BPBS for 30 min. Between each of these steps, the sections were washed with PBS/glycine (6 times for 5 min). After this, the sections were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS/glycine for 30 min. They were then incubated with Affi-K7 followed by protein A-gold (diameter, 5 nm), both in BPBS. Washings were with PBS/glycine as above. The sections were then post-fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min, washed with PBS and distilled water, counterstained with neutral 2% uranyl acetate for 5 min, and coated with 1.8% methylcellulose with 0.3% uranyl acetate. The sections were analyzed using a Philips 410 LS transmission electron microscope. Whole-cell lysates were prepared from the cells grown to confluence. They were first rinsed with PBS and then scraped into a lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.1 μm aprotinin, 0.1 mmleupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm benzamidine), and incubated in an ice bath for 20 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation (IP), Affi-K7 or anti-filamin antibodies were added to 500 μl of the cell lysate (0.15 mg/ml). For control reactions, an equal volume of PBS was added instead of the antibody. Then 50 μl of anti-rabbit IgG-agarose or anti-mouse IgG-agarose, respectively, in PBS was added and incubated on a nutator for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifuging at 500 × g for 2 min and then washing three times with PBS. The volume was adjusted to 60 μl with PBS. After addition of the Laemmli's sample buffer (15 μl) and boiling for 2 min, the eluates were run on a 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE and then analyzed by immunoblotting (IB). Bacterially produced GST-FAP52 or GST was immobilized on GSH-Sepharose 4B beads in PBS. The beads (25 μl) were incubated with the CEHF lysate (0.15 mg of protein in 500 μl of lysis buffer) overnight at +4 °C on a nutator. They were then washed three times with PBS, and the volume was adjusted to 60 μl with PBS. After addition of 15 μl of a sample buffer and boiling, the proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel which was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB). For the pull-down experiments, 5 μg of the GST fusions of fragments of FAP52 or filamin were immobilized on 20 μl of GSH-Sepharose 4B beads in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Twenty μg of the chicken gizzard filamin or the bacterially produced FAP52, respectively, in 500 μl of TBS was added, and the mixture was then incubated for 2 h at +4 °C on a nutator. The beads were washed three times with TBS and, after addition of 20 μl of a sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE separation, followed by IB with mouse anti-filamin or Affi-K7, respectively. For IB, the electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to NC membranes that were then blocked in 3% nonfat dried milk powder in TBS. Thereafter, the filters were incubated with Affi-K7 or mouse anti-filamin for 1 h at room temperature (RT). After an overnight washing with TBS at RT, the filters were incubated either with the HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or the HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, respectively. After a 5-h washing with TBS, the blot was developed by the ECL method as described previously (1.Meriläinen J. Lehto V.-P. Wasenius V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23278-23284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For blot OL assays, bacterially produced FAP52 and GST or GST fusions of filamin mutants were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to NC membranes. The filters were blocked by incubating with 3% nonfat dried milk powder in TBS overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at RT, and then incubated with the purified filamin or recombinant FAP52 in 1% nonfat dried milk powder in TBS for overnight at 4 °C. For the visualization of the protein bands, the overlays were washed with TBS for 3 h and then incubated with either the mouse anti-filamin antibodies or Affi-K7, respectively, as above, followed by an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG, respectively. The blots were developed by using the ECL detection system. For mass spectrometry, pieces corresponding to the protein bands of interest were excised from the CBB-stained polyacrylamide gels and processed as described by Shevchenko et al. (10.Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen P. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). Briefly, the proteins were in gel-reduced, alkylated, and digested with trypsin at 37 °C. The supernatant obtained was acidified with formic acid, loaded onto a Poros R2 (Perspective Biosystems) microcolumn, and desalted according to Gobom et al. (11.Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). The peptides eluted with 40% methanol, 5% formic acid were introduced into a nanoelectrospray needle (Protona). Nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry was performed on an API III mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source, as described elsewhere (12.Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were performed on a BIACORE 3000 analyzer under a control of a BIACORE control software, version 3.1.1. (Biacore AB). For experiments with the GST fusions of FAP52, of Fil-(1524–2283), or mutants thereof as a ligand, anti-GST antibody (Biacore AB) was immobilized on a carboxymethyl-coated CM5 sensor chip by employing the GST capture and the amine coupling kits (Biacore AB). Full-length GST-FAP52, or its mutants (0.15 mg/ml in 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 5.5), or GST-Fil-(1524–2283), or its mutants (0.15 mg/ml in HBS-EP; 0.01 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.15 mNaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) polysorbate 20; Biacore AB), were then injected onto the chip for 30 s with a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The chip was then equilibrated with HBS-EP. For binding assays, chicken gizzard filamin or recombinant FAP52, both in HBS-EP, were then passed over the chip at concentrations ranging from 0 to 800 nm at a flow rate of 30 μl for 1 min for filamin or 3 min for FAP52. The binding of the analyte to the ligand was detected from the change in the sensorgram. To correct the sensorgram for a background binding and bulk refractive index changes, a different flow cell without GST fusion protein was used as a reference. As controls, GST-coated chips were used over which filamin or FAP52 was passed at a concentration of 100 nm. Kinetics was analyzed by BIAevaluation software, version 3.1. To identify binding partners of FAP52, we carried out IP experiments from the lysates of cultured CEHF by using affinity-purified rabbit anti-FAP52 antibodies (Affi-K7). IP followed by an SDS-PAGE and silver staining revealed reproducibly a 280-kDa polypeptide band that was seen in the experimental (Fig. 1A, lane 2) but not in the control precipitations (Fig. 1A, lane 1). A band of a similar molecular weight was also detected in the affinity binding (“pull-down”) experiments in which the cell lysate was passed over a column in which GST-FAP52 was coupled onto GSH-conjugated Sepharose beads (Fig. 1B, lane 2). No such band was seen in control experiments with GST-coated beads (Fig. 1B, lane 1). In pull-down but not in IP experiments another prominent band of about 220 kDa was seen. The 280-kDa band was excised from the CBB-stained gel and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. The extracted peptides then underwent analysis by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The partial primary structures of several peptides in the mass spectrum of the 280-kDa band were compared with the sequences in the data bases. In five cases there was a match with GST, in four cases with FAP52, in one case with myosin, and in one case with filamin (ABP-280 (13.Gorlin J.B. Yamin R. Egan S. Stewart M. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar)). We also analyzed the 220-kDa band seen in Fig. 1B. Five of seven peptides showed a match with myosin heavy chain. We concluded that the myosin sequence found among the peptides derived from the 280-kDa band is actually originating from the more abundant material in the 220-kDa band. Because the filamin-like sequence derived from the band that was not seen in the controls and because the partial sequence and the molecular weight of the band match with those of filamin, we decided to explore the possibility of an interaction between filamin and FAP52. The presence of FAP52, GST, and myosin sequences among the peptides derived from the 280-kDa band was deemed unauthentic and was most probably due to an abundance of these proteins in the type of experiments that were carried out. The association between filamin and FAP52 was further explored by IP of FAP52 from a lysate of CEHF cells and then analyzing the precipitate by IB for coprecipitation of filamin. In a reciprocal experiment with HA-tagged FAP52 (FAP52-HA)-transfected HeLa cells, anti-filamin immunoprecipitate was analyzed for co-IP of FAP52-HA. As shown in Fig. 2A, filamin was present in the precipitate obtained by using Affi-K7 but not in the control precipitates (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 1, respectively). On the other hand, FAP52-HA was seen in the anti-filamin but not in the control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 1, respectively). These data show that FAP52 and filamin co-immunoprecipitate from the cell lysates and suggest that there could be a direct interaction between FAP52 and filamin. To determine whether the observed co-IP of FAP52 and filamin is due to a direct interaction between them or is mediated by some other protein(s), we carried out direct binding assays. In OL assay, bacterially produced FAP52 or GST fusions of the C-terminal fragments of filamin were run in SDS-PAGE, transferred to an NC membrane, and then overlaid with purified filamin or FAP52, respectively, followed by an incubation with relevant antibodies and an ECL detection. As seen in Fig. 3A, filamin binds to FAP52 (Fig. 3A, lane 2) but not to GST that was used as a control (Fig. 3A, lane 1). In Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4, positions of GST and FAP52, respectively, in a parallel SDS-PAGE, stained with CBB, are shown. In a reciprocal experiment, binding of FAP52 to filter-anchored filamin was tested. For that purpose, bacterially produced C-terminal fragments of filamin in the fusion with GST were used. In OL, binding of FAP52 is seen to GST-Fil-(1524–2283) (Fig. 3B, lane 1) but not to GST-Fil-(2283–2496) (lane 2) or to GST-Fil-(2495–2647) (lane 3). In Fig. 3B, lanes 4–6, a parallel SDS-PAGE run of the same fusion proteins is shown. The polypeptides were transferred to NC filter and visualized by the anti-GST antibody and the ECL detection system. These data show that there is a direct interaction between FAP52 and filamin and that in filamin the interaction site resides in the fragment encompassing the residues 1524–2283. The interaction between filamin and FAP52 was further explored by SPR analysis. In these experiments, anti-GST antibody was immobilized on a chip and used to capture the GST-FAP52 fusion protein. The sensorgram (Fig. 3C) obtained upon injection of chicken gizzard filamin at concentrations ranging from 0 to 800 nm onto the GST-FAP52-coated chip shows a high affinity binding between filamin and FAP52. The association and dissociation rate constants ka and kd were determined to be 1.06 × 105m−1s−1 and 1.02 × 10−3 s−1, respectively, yielding a dissociation rate constant (KD = kd/ka) of 9.64 × 10−9m. No binding was observed in the control experiments in which the GST-coated chip was overlaid with filamin (Fig. 3C, inset). Pull-down assay and SPR were used to map the filamin-binding region in FAP52. For that purpose, a large number of truncation mutants of FAP52 were expressed as GST fusions in bacteria, purified, and used in the assays. For the pull-down assays, GST-FAP52 or its mutants were immobilized on GSH-Sepharose beads and incubated with chicken gizzard filamin. After collecting and washing the beads, they were run on SDS-PAGE. The electrophoretically separated proteins were then transferred to an NC membrane, followed by an incubation with the mouse anti-filamin and the ECL detection. Fig. 4A shows that anti-filamin reactive material could be harvested not only from the beads carrying the full-length GST-FAP52 (lane 5) but also those carrying the peptides 1–184, 1–219, and 1–359 (lanes 2–4). No binding of filamin was seen to beads carrying the more N-terminal peptides 1–145 (lane 1) or the C-terminal peptides 146–448, 185–448, 220–448, 281–448, 360–448, and 390–448 (lanes 6–11). For SPR analysis, the GST fusion of FAP52 or its mutants were immobilized onto a sensor chip, and chicken gizzard filamin was then passed over the chip at a concentration of 100 nm. Fig. 4B shows that filamin binds to the GST-FAP52-(1–448) and to the N-terminal peptides 1–184, 1–219, and 1–359. No binding was observed to peptides 1–145, 146–448, 185–448, 220–448, 281–448, 360–448, or 390–448. Fig. 4C shows an SDS-PAGE gel of the fusion proteins used in the experiments. Both the OL and the SPR results indicated, in total conformity, that the residues 146–184 have an essential role in the binding of filamin. The capability of this region alone to bind filamin was tested with SPR, in an experiment in which filamin was passed over the GST-FAP52-(146–184)-coated chip. No binding was observed (Fig. 4B, inset). Thus, it can be concluded that the region spanning aa 146–184 is necessary but not sufficient for the binding of filamin. For the binding, a sequence N-terminal to the aa 145 is needed as indicated by binding with an N-terminal 1–184 peptide. The FAP52-binding site in filamin was determined by pull-down experiments and by SPR by employing sequentially truncated mutants of the C-terminal half of filamin in fusion with GST. For the pull-down experiments, filamin mutants in fusion with GST were immobilized onto the GSH-Sepharose beads which were then incubated with the recombinant FAP52. Binding of FAP52 to the beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by a transfer to an NC filter, IB with Affi-K7, and ECL detection. Fig. 5A shows the binding of FAP52 to the filamin peptides 1524–1858, 1524–1956, 1524–2064, 1524–2132, 1524–2172, and 1524–2283 (lanes 3–8). There was no binding of FAP52 to the peptides 1524–1780 and 1524–1664 (lanes 1 and 2). For SPR analysis, GST-Fil-(1524–2283) or its truncated mutants were captured onto the sensor chip, and the recombinant FAP52 was passed over the chip. In Fig. 5B, binding of FAP52 to the truncated filamins is shown. A strong binding is seen to the peptides 1524–1780, 1524–1858, 1524–1956, 1524–2064, 1524–2132, 1524–2172, and 1524–2283 and a weak binding to 1524–1664. In F"

Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1993; 64: 231-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, application of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) similarity studies showed that this original genusPseudomonas is diverse and contains five distantly related groups. Of these, RNA group I contains the members of the true genusPseudomonas. The new genus Burkholderia (RNA group II) contains species that are either plant or animal pathogens.B. caryophylli is responsible for the wilting of carnation (2Jones L.K. Phytopathology. 1941; 31: 199Google Scholar), and it shares with other Gram-negative species the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs)1in its cell wall. One characteristic feature of LPSs from the genusBurkholderia is the occurrence of two differentO-specific polysaccharides. In the case of LPSs fromB. caryophylli, two linear homo-polysaccharides were identified as O-specific polysaccharides, one of which is furnished from 3,6,10-trideoxy-4-C-(d-glycero-1-hydroxyethyl)-d-erythro-d-gulo-decose (caryophyllose, α-1→7-linked, caryophyllan) and the other from 4,8-cyclo-3,9-dideoxy-l-erythro-d-ido-nonose (caryose, β-1→7-linked, caryan) (3Adinolfi M.

Res. 1996; 284: 111-118Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The caryan is acetylated in nonstoichiometric amounts, leading to a block pattern and, thus, to the establishment of repeating units in a homopolymer (7De Molinaro A. Castro C. Petersen B.O. Duus J.Ø. Parrilli M. Holst O. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2000; 39: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), while only the side chain the caryophyllan is randomly acetylated, and no chemical repeating unit was possible to define (8De Castro C. Lanzetta R. Molinaro A. Parrilli M. Piscopo V. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 335: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).In LPSs, the O-specific polysaccharide is linked to the core region, which in turn is bound to the lipid A (9Mamat U. Seydel U. Grimmecke D. Holst O. Rietschel E.Th. Barton D. Nakanishi K. Meth-Cohn O. Pinto B.M. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 3. Elsevier Science Ltd., Oxford1998: 179-239Google Scholar). All core regions identified so far (10Holst O. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar) possess at least one residue of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) that links this region to the lipid A (Kdo I). A second characteristic molecule of the core region isl-glycero-d-manno-heptose (Hep); however, there are heptose-free LPSs (e.g. of the genera Chlamydia and Acinetobacter). In those cases Hep is present, Kdo I is usually substituted by a Hep residue at O-5, regardless to the number of Kdo residues in the structure, and elongation of the core occurs from this Hep residue. Thus, the presence of one Hep-α-(1→5)-Kdo moiety is a characteristic feature of heptose-containing core regions of LPSs. Kdo I may further be substituted at O-4 by a second Kdo residue (Kdo II, e.g. inSalmonella enterica and Escherichia coli). In a few cases, Kdo II is further substituted by neutral sugar residues,e.g. l-rhamnose or d-galactose, in particular E. coli strains. As elucidated best for LPSs ofE. coli (11Rick P.D. Raetz C.R.H. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 283-304Google Scholar, 12Heinrichs D.E. Valvano M.A. Whitfield C. Brade H. Morrsion D.C.

Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 3-23PubMed Google Scholar), biosynthesis of the initial parts of the core region begins with the attachment of the Kdo-α-(2→4)-Kdo disaccharide to tetraacyl-lipid A (precursor IVA). After completion of the acylation of lipid A, the first Hep is attached to O-5 of Kdo I, followed by further elongation steps.LPSs of plant-pathogenic bacteria have been shown to play a role in phytopathogenicity (14Dow M. Newman M.-A. von Roepenack E. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2000; 38: 241-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Since there is only little information on the structure-function relationship of LPSs from B. caryophylli, we have begun with the characterization of its LPSs. Here, we report the structure of the core region which possesses as a novel feature two Hep-α-(1→5)-Kdo moieties.DISCUSSIONB. caryophylli had been named Pseudomonas caryophylli before 1973 and, thus, was taxonomically included in the genus Pseudomonas, which, because of the diversity of functions found in its members, harbored a large number of species (1Palleroni N.J. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1993; 64: 231-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Many attempts to develop systems of classification ofPseudomonas species had failed during the first half of the 20th century, and it was then the research on rRNA sequence similarities among Pseudomonas species that resulted in an internal subdivision of the genus into five RNA homology groups. This subdivision was largely confirmed by investigations on e.g.fatty acid compositions, the appearance of the outer membrane protein OprP, and genome structure and organization. The first of the RNA homology groups (RNA group 1) contains authentic Pseudomonasspecies, and RNA group 2 consists of species of a new genus namedBurkholderia. Quite a number of structures of LPSs fromPseudomonas and some from Burkholderia species have been investigated so far. With regard to the core region of LPSs, which is structurally more conserved than the O-specific polysaccharide, published structures indicate that the core regions ofPseudomonas LPSs differ from those ofBurkholderia LPSs (10Holst O. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar, 33Isshiki, Y., Kawahara, K., and Zähringer, U. (1998) in The Fifth Conference of the International Endotoxin Society September 12–15, Santa Fe, NM, Poster Abstract 70, International Endotoxin SocietyGoogle Scholar), which is confirmed by the data presented in this paper. In particular, one residue ofd-glycero-α-d-talo-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Ko) was identified in the LPSs of Burkholderia cepaciaand Burkholderia pseudomallei, replacing the branching Kdo (Kdo II). This has not been identified in any LPS fromPseudomonas and, thus, might be of chemotaxonomical importance for the differentiation of both genera.The linkages of the sugars in the O-specific polymers of the LPSs of B. caryophylli are acid-labile, and in preliminary experiments it could be shown that treatment of the LPSs with 48% aqueous HF (4 °C, 48 h) not only removed the phosphate groups but also cleaved the O-specific polysaccharides. Thus, we applied this method and succeeded, after additional reduction and deacylation of the LPS, in the isolation of the complete carbohydrate backbone of the core-lipid A region. Its structure (Fig. 1) could be established from chemical and methylation analyses and from NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric investigations. The core region contains a structural element that commonly occurs in theSalmonella type core regions of enterobacterial LPS,e.g. from S. enterica or E. coli, namely α-d-Glcp-(1→3)-[l-α-d-Hepp-(1→7)-]-l-α-d-Hepp-(1→3)-l-α-d-Hepp-(1→5)-[α-Kdo-2→4)]-α-Kdo-(2→ (10Holst O. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). The Glcp residue of this moiety is substituted by two hexoses, i.e. Glcp and Galp, which is similar to several enterobacterial core structures. In dissimilarity to the Salmonella type core regions, the core region from LPSs of B. caryophylli is free of phosphate and contains a Glcp residue that is β-(1→4)-linked to Hep E. The last structural element represents a characteristic feature of phosphate-deficient (e.g. Yersinia enterocolitica, Proteus mirabilis) or phosphate-free (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae) core regions. In the core region of LPSs from B. caryophylli it is substituted at O-6 by another α-Glcp residue. The same disaccharidic substituent occurs also in the core region of LPS from P. mirabilis strain R110/1959 (34Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Mayer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Vinogradov E. Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Kaca W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Most strikingly and identified for the first time, the core region of B. caryophylli LPSs possesses twol-α-d-Hepp-(1→5)-α-Kdo-2→ moieties (N-D andE-C), one of which is linked to lipid A and the other to Kdo C. In several cases, a (nonstoichiometric) substitution of the branching Kdo residue with other sugars has been identified. Despite the fact that in several LPSs this residue is substituted at O-4 (S. enterica, E. coli,Chlamydia (9Mamat U. Seydel U. Grimmecke D. Holst O. Rietschel E.Th. Barton D. Nakanishi K. Meth-Cohn O.

Res. 1997; 304: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)).With regard to these structures, a substitution of Kdo D at O-5 by Hep may be considered as just another variant. However, with regard to biosynthesis of LPS, this substitution is of higher bearing. Biosynthesis of the core region is best established for the LPSs ofE. coli (11Rick P.D. Raetz C.R.H. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 283-304Google Scholar, 12Heinrichs D.E. Valvano M.A. Whitfield C. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 305-330Google Scholar, 13Gronow S. Brade H. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 3-23PubMed Google Scholar). It begins with the attachment of two Kdo residues to precursor IVA, the tetraacylated and bisphosphorylated GlcN-disaccharide, which is performed by one Kdo-transferase WaaA (KdtA). This step occurs differently in LPS biosynthesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where both Kdo residues are transferred to the completed (fully acylated) lipid A (41Goldman R.C. Doran C.C. Kadam S.K. Capobianco J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5217-5223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,42Mohan S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6944-6951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, here and in E. coli, after completion of lipid A employing two additional acylation steps, the Kdo that is attached to lipid A (Kdo I, residue C in Fig. 3) is substituted at O-5 by Hepp, a step that is brought about by heptosyltransferase I, which is encoded by the gene waaC. In a next step ofE. coli LPS biosynthesis, this Hepp residue is then substituted at O-3 by another Hepp through the action of heptosyltransferase II, which is encoded by the genewaaF. Then further steps of core biosynthesis follow,i.e. attachment of the first Glcp (bywaaG) and the third Hepp to Hep II (bywaaQ), and completion of the outer core region. Possibly, decorations of the core, like the attachment of branching sugars or outer core heptose residues (e.g. Hepp inE. coli K-12 (38Holst O. Zähringer U. Brade H. Zamojski A. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 215: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), dd-Hepp inK. pneumoniae (19Süsskind M. Brade L. Brade H. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7006-7017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or P. mirabilis R110/1959 (34Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Mayer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,35Vinogradov E. Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Kaca W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)), occur at later stages of the biosynthesis. With regard to the introduction of outer core heptose residues in LPS core biosynthesis, it is unknown whether the same heptosyltransferases that furnish the inner core region are utilized again or whether other, specific heptosyltransferases are activated. This is also true for the biosynthesis of the twol-α-d-Hepp-(1→5)-α-Kdo-2→ moieties in the LPSs of B. caryophylli, and current data do not favor one possibility over the other.Several core structures of LPSs from Ps. aeruginosa andPs. fluorescens have been published (10Holst O. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar); however, with the core structure of LPSs from B. caryophylli these only share the structural elementl-α-d-Hepp-(1→3)-l-α-d-Hepp-(1→5)-[α-Kdo-2→4)]-α-Kdo-(2→. One of the distinguishing features of B. caryophylli LPSs is their low phosphate content. Of LPSs from the genusBurkholderia, two core structures are known, i.e.from LPSs of B. cepacia GIFU 645 (43Kawahara K. Isshiki Y. Dejsirilert S. Ezaki T. Zähringer U. The Fifth Conference of the International Endotoxin Society.1998Google Scholar) and from B. pseudomallei GIFU 12046 (33Isshiki, Y., Kawahara, K., and Zähringer, U. (1998) in The Fifth Conference of the International Endotoxin Society September 12–15, Santa Fe, NM, Poster Abstract 70, International Endotoxin SocietyGoogle Scholar). Both structures are similar to that of the core region from B. caryophylli, since they are free of phosphate and possess the structural elementl-α-d-Hepp-(1→7)-l-α- d-Hepp-(1→3)-[β-d-Glcp-(1→4)]-l-α-d-Hepp-(1→5)-α-Kdo-(2→. However, in these cases Kdo I is substituted at O-4 byd-glycero-α-d-talo-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Ko) rather than Kdo. In the LPSs of B. caryophylli, only small amounts of Ko could be detected, and no core oligosaccharide possessing this sugar could be isolated. 2A. Molinaro, C. De Castro, R. Lanzetta, M. Parrilli, and O. Holst, unpublished data. It is thus unclear whether the same α-Ko-(2→4)-α-Kdo disaccharide is present in this core region. Whereas in the core region of B. pseudomalleiHep II is substituted at O-3 by α-d-Glcp, this particular Hep carries in the core region of LPS from B. cepacia an l-Rhap residue at O-2, which represents another unusual structural feature. Burkholderia caryophylli is a phytopathogenic Gram-negative bacterium that had earlier been included in the genusPseudomonas (1Palleroni N.J. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1993; 64: 231-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, application of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) similarity studies showed that this original genusPseudomonas is diverse and contains five distantly related groups. Of these, RNA group I contains the members of the true genusPseudomonas. The new genus Burkholderia (RNA group II) contains species that are either plant or animal pathogens.B. caryophylli is responsible for the wilting of carnation (2Jones L.K. Phytopathology. 1941; 31: 199Google Scholar), and it shares with other Gram-negative species the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs)1in its cell wall. One characteristic feature of LPSs from the genusBurkholderia is the occurrence of two differentO-specific polysaccharides. In the case of LPSs fromB. caryophylli, two linear homo-polysaccharides were identified as O-specific polysaccharides, one of which is furnished from 3,6,10-trideoxy-4-C-(d-glycero-1-hydroxyethyl)-d-erythro-d-gulo-decose (caryophyllose, α-1→7-linked, caryophyllan) and the other from 4,8-cyclo-3,9-dideoxy-l-erythro-d-ido-nonose (caryose, β-1→7-linked, caryan) (3Adinolfi M.

The caryan is acetylated in nonstoichiometric amounts, leading to a block pattern and, thus, to the establishment of repeating units in a homopolymer (7De Molinaro A. Castro C. Petersen B.O. Duus J.Ø. Parrilli M. Holst O. Angew. Chem. Int.

In LPSs, the O-specific polysaccharide is linked to the core region, which in turn is bound to the lipid A (9Mamat U. Seydel U. Grimmecke D. Holst O. Rietschel E.Th. Barton D. Nakanishi K. Meth-Cohn O. Pinto B.M. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 3. Elsevier Science Ltd., Oxford1998: 179-239Google Scholar). All core regions identified so far (10Holst O. Brade H. Morrsion D.C.

However, with regard to biosynthesis of LPS, this substitution is of higher bearing. Biosynthesis of the core region is best established for the LPSs ofE. coli (11Rick P.D. Raetz C.R.H. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 283-304Google Scholar, 12Heinrichs D.E. Valvano M.A. Whitfield C. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S.

It begins with the attachment of two Kdo residues to precursor IVA, the tetraacylated and bisphosphorylated GlcN-disaccharide, which is performed by one Kdo-transferase WaaA (KdtA). This step occurs differently in LPS biosynthesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where both Kdo residues are transferred to the completed (fully acylated) lipid A (41Goldman R.C. Doran C.C. Kadam S.K. Capobianco J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5217-5223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,42Mohan S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6944-6951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, here and in E. coli, after completion of lipid A employing two additional acylation steps, the Kdo that is attached to lipid A (Kdo I, residue C in Fig. 3) is substituted at O-5 by Hepp, a step that is brought about by heptosyltransferase I, which is encoded by the gene waaC. In a next step ofE. coli LPS biosynthesis, this Hepp residue is then substituted at O-3 by another Hepp through the action of heptosyltransferase II, which is encoded by the genewaaF. Then further steps of core biosynthesis follow,i.e. attachment of the first Glcp (bywaaG) and the third Hepp to Hep II (bywaaQ), and completion of the outer core region. Possibly, decorations of the core, like the attachment of branching sugars or outer core heptose residues (e.g. Hepp inE. coli K-12 (38Holst O. Zähringer U. Brade H. Zamojski A. Carbohydr.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)), occur at later stages of the biosynthesis. With regard to the introduction of outer core heptose residues in LPS core biosynthesis, it is unknown whether the same heptosyltransferases that furnish the inner core region are utilized again or whether other, specific heptosyltransferases are activated. This is also true for the biosynthesis of the twol-α-d-Hepp-(1→5)-α-Kdo-2→ moieties in the LPSs of B. caryophylli, and current data do not favor one possibility over the other.Several core structures of LPSs from Ps. aeruginosa andPs. fluorescens have been published (10Holst O. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar); however, with the core structure of LPSs from B. caryophylli these only share the structural elementl-α-d-Hepp-(1→3)-l-α-d-Hepp-(1→5)-[α-Kdo-2→4)]-α-Kdo-(2→. One of the distinguishing features of B. caryophylli LPSs is their low phosphate content. Of LPSs from the genusBurkholderia, two core structures are known, i.e.from LPSs of B. cepacia GIFU 645 (43Kawahara K. Isshiki Y. Dejsirilert S. Ezaki T. Zähringer U. The Fifth Conference of the International Endotoxin Society.1998Google Scholar) and from B. pseudomallei GIFU 12046 (33Isshiki, Y., Kawahara, K., and Zähringer, U. (1998) in The Fifth Conference of the International Endotoxin Society September 12–15, Santa Fe, NM, Poster Abstract 70, International Endotoxin SocietyGoogle Scholar). Both structures are similar to that of the core region from B. caryophylli, since they are free of phosphate and possess the structural elementl-α-d-Hepp-(1→7)-l-α- d-Hepp-(1→3)-[β-d-Glcp-(1→4)]-l-α-d-Hepp-(1→5)-α-Kdo-(2→. However, in these cases Kdo I is substituted at O-4 byd-glycero-α-d-talo-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Ko) rather than Kdo. In the LPSs of B. caryophylli, only small amounts of Ko could be detected, and no core oligosaccharide possessing this sugar could be isolated. 2A. Molinaro, C. De Castro, R. Lanzetta, M. Parrilli, and O. Holst, unpublished data. It is thus unclear whether the same α-Ko-(2→4)-α-Kdo disaccharide is present in this core region. Whereas in the core region of B. pseudomalleiHep II is substituted at O-3 by α-d-Glcp, this particular Hep carries in the core region of LPS from B. cepacia an l-Rhap residue at O-2, which represents another unusual structural feature. B. caryophylli had been named Pseudomonas caryophylli before 1973 and, thus, was taxonomically included in the genus Pseudomonas, which, because of the diversity of functions found in its members, harbored a large number of species (1Palleroni N.J. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1993; 64: 231-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Many attempts to develop systems of classification ofPseudomonas species had failed during the first half of the 20th century, and it was then the research on rRNA sequence similarities among Pseudomonas species that resulted in an internal subdivision of the genus into five RNA homology groups. This subdivision was largely confirmed by investigations on e.g.fatty acid compositions, the appearance of the outer membrane protein OprP, and genome structure and organization. The first of the RNA homology groups (RNA group 1) contains authentic Pseudomonasspecies, and RNA group 2 consists of species of a new genus namedBurkholderia. Quite a number of structures of LPSs fromPseudomonas and some from Burkholderia species have been investigated so far. With regard to the core region of LPSs, which is structurally more conserved than the O-specific polysaccharide, published structures indicate that the core regions ofPseudomonas LPSs differ from those ofBurkholderia LPSs (10Holst O. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar, 33Isshiki, Y., Kawahara, K., and Zähringer, U. (1998) in The Fifth Conference of the International Endotoxin Society September 12–15, Santa Fe, NM, Poster Abstract 70, International Endotoxin SocietyGoogle Scholar), which is confirmed by the data presented in this paper. In particular, one residue ofd-glycero-α-d-talo-oct-2-ulopyranosonic acid (Ko) was identified in the LPSs of Burkholderia cepaciaand Burkholderia pseudomallei, replacing the branching Kdo (Kdo II). This has not been identified in any LPS fromPseudomonas and, thus, might be of chemotaxonomical importance for the differentiation of both genera. The linkages of the sugars in the O-specific polymers of the LPSs of B. caryophylli are acid-labile, and in preliminary experiments it could be shown that treatment of the LPSs with 48% aqueous HF (4 °C, 48 h) not only removed the phosphate groups but also cleaved the O-specific polysaccharides. Thus, we applied this method and succeeded, after additional reduction and deacylation of the LPS, in the isolation of the complete carbohydrate backbone of the core-lipid A region. Its structure (Fig. 1) could be established from chemical and methylation analyses and from NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric investigations. The core region contains a structural element that commonly occurs in theSalmonella type core regions of enterobacterial LPS,e.g. from S. enterica or E. coli, namely α-d-Glcp-(1→3)-[l-α-d-Hepp-(1→7)-]-l-α-d-Hepp-(1→3)-l-α-d-Hepp-(1→5)-[α-Kdo-2→4)]-α-Kdo-(2→ (10Holst O. Brade H. Morrsion D.C. Opal S. Vogel S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1999: 115-154Google Scholar). The Glcp residue of this moiety is substituted by two hexoses, i.e. Glcp and Galp, which is similar to several enterobacterial core structures. In dissimilarity to the Salmonella type core regions, the core region from LPSs of B. caryophylli is free of phosphate and contains a Glcp residue that is β-(1→4)-linked to Hep E. The last structural element represents a characteristic feature of phosphate-deficient (e.g. Yersinia enterocolitica, Proteus mirabilis) or phosphate-free (e.g. Klebsiella pneumoniae) core regions. In the core region of LPSs from B. caryophylli it is substituted at O-6 by another α-Glcp residue. The same disaccharidic substituent occurs also in the core region of LPS from P. mirabilis strain R110/1959 (34Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Mayer H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Vinogradov E. Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Kaca W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Most strikingly and identified for the first time, the core region of B. caryophylli LPSs possesses twol-α-d-Hepp-(1→5)-α-Kdo-2→ moieties (N-D andE-C), one of which is linked to lipid A and the other to Kdo C. In several cases, a (nonstoichiometric) substitution of the branching Kdo residue with other sugars has been identified. Despite the fact that in several LPSs this residue is substituted at O-4 (S. enterica, E. coli,Chlamydia (9Mamat U. Seydel U. Grimmecke D. Holst O. Rietschel E.Th. Barton D. Nakanishi K. Meth-Cohn O.

Administration of the ligand mifepristone (MFP) up-regulated GHRH expression, as shown by elevations of IGF-I levels, and when MFP dosing was withdrawn, IGF-I returned to baseline levels. Five cycles of IGF-I induction were observed during a five-month period. Chronic MFP dosing for 25 days increased lean body mass, weight gain, and bone mineral density significantly compared with non-MFP treated controls. In summary, long-term drug-regulated GHRH expression was achieved following plasmid-based gene therapy, and chronic induction of GHRH expression in adult animals led to improvements in weight gain and body composition."
https://openalex.org/W2320522872,Our previous studies showed that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and the p16 tumor suppressor gene play a significant role in glioma invasion. We expected that downregulation of uPAR and overexpression of p16 using a bicistronic vector might cause a additive and cooperative effect in the suppression of glioma invasion and growth. The bicistronic construct (Ad-uPAR/p16)-infected glioblastoma cell lines had significantly lower levels of uPAR and higher levels of p16 than controls. Cell cycle analysis showed the bicistronic vector caused G0/G1 arrest of the cell cycle. In vitro glioblastoma cell growth and invasiveness were inhibited in Ad-uPAR/p16-infected cells compared with controls. Ad-uPAR/p16 suppressed the tumor growth of glioblastoma cell lines in an ex vivo intracerebral tumor model and an in vivo subcutaneous tumor model. Our results support the therapeutic potential of simultaneously targeting uPAR and p16 in the treatment of gliomas.
https://openalex.org/W2010930431,"The auxiliary β4 subunit of the humanslowpoke calciumdependent potassium (slo) channel is expressed predominantly in the brain. Co-expression of β4 subunit with the slo channel α subunit in HEK293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells slows channel activation and deactivation and also shifts the voltage dependence of the channel to more depolarized potentials. We show here that the functional interaction between the hβ4 subunit and theslo channel is influenced by the phosphorylation state of hβ4. Treatment of cells with okadaic acid (OA) reduces the effect of hβ4 on slo channel activation kinetics and voltage dependence but not on slo channel deactivation kinetics. The effect of OA can be blocked by mutating three putative serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in hβ4 (Thr-11/Ser-17/Ser-210) to alanines, suggesting that OA potentiates phosphorylation of hβ4 and thereby suppresses its functional coupling to the slochannel. Mutation of Ser-17 alone to a negatively charged residue (S17E) can mimic the effect of OA. Mutating all three phosphorylation sites in hβ4 to negatively charged residues (T11D/S17E/S210E) not only suppresses the effect of hβ4 on slo channel activation kinetics and voltage dependence, it also suppresses its effect on slo channel deactivation kinetics. Co-immunoprecipitation/Western blot experiments indicate that all of these hβ4 mutants, as well as the wild-type hβ4, bind to theslo channel. Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of the β4 subunit dynamically regulates the functional coupling between the β4 subunit and the pore-forming α subunit of the slo channel.

There is considerable variation in the sensitivity of different types of KCa channel to protein kinase modulation (24Reinhart P.H. Chung S. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Levitan I.B. J.

In the present study we investigated the effect of phosphorylation of the β4 subunit on its functional interaction with the slowpoke α subunit. hβ4 was cloned into the pIRES2-EGFP vector (CLONTECH), a bicistronic vector that allows co-expression of hβ4 and green fluorescent protein in the same cell. We used the Quick-change protocol (Stratagene) to make point mutations in the β4 subunit. Briefly, a PCR was performed, using the wild-type β4 as the template and a pair of complementary mutagenesis primers. The PCR mixture was then cut with the enzyme DpnI to digest the template wild-type β4. AfterDpnI digestion, the PCR product was used to transform competent bacterial cells, and the mutant plasmid of β4 was then amplified. All mutant constructs were verified by sequencing (University of Pennsylvania Sequencing Facility, Philadelphia). CHO cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were seeded on 35-mm culture dishes and transfected 2 days later with the appropriate slo and β4 DNA using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). CHO cells were used for recording 1–3 days after transfection. The slo channel was cloned into the pcDNA3 vector. The β4 subunit was cloned into the pIRES2-EGFP vector (CLONTECH). Cells were transfected with both constructs, and transfected cells were identified by their green fluorescence; all such cells were found to express slocurrent. Recording electrodes were pulled to have resistances of 1.5–2 megohms when filled with regular pipette solution. slocurrent was recorded in the whole-cell recording mode. Solutions for the recording are as follows: bath solution, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2; and pipette solution, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 3.4 mm CaCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES. Recording was performed using an Axopatch 200A amplifier and pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Data were analyzed off line using pClamp8 software. For measuring the time course of slochannel activation and deactivation, the cells were held at −80 mV, and the membrane potential was stepped to +40 mV for 200 ms and then back to −80 mV. For measuring the current-voltage relationship of theslo channel, the cells were held at −80 mV, and depolarizations in steps of 20 mV were then applied for 200 ms. The maximum instantaneous tail current after stepping the membrane potential back to −80 mV was measured. To quantify the activation kinetics, the activation of the slo current was fitted with a two-exponential function, giving rise to a fast and a slow time constant (τ). Similarly the deactivation current was fitted with a two-exponential function. The half-activation voltage (V 12) was derived by fitting the current-voltage relationship curve with a Boltzmann function. All results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using the Student's t test in SigmaPlot software. These experiments were done as described previously (11Weiger T.M. Holmqvist M.H. Levitan I.B. Clark F.T. Sprague S. Huang W.J. Ge P. Wang C. Lawson D. Jurman M.E. Glucksmann M.A. Silos-Santiago I. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3563-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Zhou Y.

Epitope-tagged hβ4 in pCDNA3.1 was expressed in HEK293 cells, either alone or together with hSlo. 36 h after transfection, the cells were lysed and incubated with antibody raised against mSlo that also recognize hSlo. 2H. Wen and I. B. Levitan, unpublished observations. The immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Proteins in the lysate or immunoprecipitate were separated on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline), the blots were probed with primary antibody directed either against mSlo or the V5 epitope tag. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-V5 (Invitrogen) was used as secondary antibody for hβ4 blots. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the secondary antibody for hSloblots. The membrane was washed with TBST, and proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). HEK293 cells were transfected with hSlo and hβ4 as described earlier. Eight hours after transfection, [32P]orthophosphate was added into the culture medium to a final concentration of 0.1 mCi/ml. The cells were labeled for 12 h with 32P and then lysed. hSlo was immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a polyacrylamide gel.32P-Labeled proteins, including hβ4, were detected by autoradiography. We showed previously that β4 slows slo channel activation in the inside-out recording configuration (11Weiger T.M. Holmqvist M.H. Levitan I.B. Clark F.T. Sprague S. Huang W.J. Ge P. Wang C. Lawson D. Jurman M.E. Glucksmann M.A. Silos-Santiago I. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3563-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar modulation ofslo channel activation by β4 was observed in the whole-cell recording configuration (Fig.1, A and B). However, this effect of β4 on slo channel activation kinetics gradually decreased with time after going into whole-cell mode. In cells expressing both slo and β4, the time constant of slo channel activation decreased over the 3-min recording period, from an initial value of 3.4 + 0.6 ms to a plateau level of about 0.8 ms (Fig. 1 E). In contrast, in cells expressing slo alone, the time constant of slochannel activation stayed unchanged over the same recording period (Fig. 1, C,D, and E). We have found a two-exponential function was necessary to fit accurately the time course of slo channel activation and deactivation. Because both the fast and the slow time constants were modulated similarly in the following experiments, as summarized in TableI, we have presented only the fast time constants in the figures.Table IActivation time constants of hslo current (mean ± S.E.)hslohslo + hβ4hslo + hβ4 + OA1-aOA, okadaic acid 0.5 μm.hslo + hβ4 AAA1-bAAA, T11A/S17A/S210A.hslo + hβ4 AAA + OAhslo + hβ4 DEE1-cDEE, T11D/S17E/S210E.hslo + hβ4 S17Eτ1(ms)0.59 ± 0.052.34 ± 0.241.47 ± 0.223.25 ± 0.463.72 ± 0.840.99 ± 0.121.56 ± 0.17τ2(ms)4.38 ± 0.4913.51 ± 1.2210.31 ± 1.4417.81 ± 1.6123.53 ± 3.656.94 ± 0.749.40 ± 0.721-a OA, okadaic acid 0.5 μm.1-b AAA, T11A/S17A/S210A.1-c DEE, T11D/S17E/S210E. Open table in a new tab Co-expression with β4 also slowed slo channel deactivation in the whole-cell recording mode. Unlike the time-dependent change of slo channel activation in the presence of β4, the time constant of slo channel deactivation did not change with time (Fig. 1, A,B, and F). These data suggest that, in the presence of β4, there was a time-dependent change of slo channel activation kinetics attributable to the whole-cell recording configuration. This change with time in the presence of β4 was unlikely to be due to the time required for Ca2+ equilibration, which is much faster. Note that the time-dependent change in activation time constant was seen only in cells expressing both slo and β4 and not in cells expressing slo alone (Fig. 1 E). In addition, the time constant of slo channel deactivation did not change with time in the absence or presence of β4 (Fig.1 F). All of these data suggest that the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ was equilibrated in less than 30 s. The same time-dependent change in slochannel activation was also observed when the slo channel was co-expressed with mutant hβ4 with three serine/threonine residues mutated to alanines (T11A, S17A, S210A). The mechanism of this time-dependent change in slo channel activation has yet to be investigated, but it is unlikely that phosphorylation of hβ4 is responsible for this phenomenon. For the purpose of the present study, we focused on slo channel function only during the first 30 s after achieving the whole-cell recording mode. Sequence analysis using ScanProsite revealed three potential serine/threonine phosphorylation residues in hβ4 (11 TEAE, 17 SIR, and RKFS 210). The threonine at position 11 is a consensus casein kinase II phosphorylation site; the serine at position 17 is a protein kinase C site; and the serine at position 210 is a PKA site. We were interested in whether phosphorylation of β4 could modulate its functional interaction with the slo channel. Preincubating cells expressing both slo and β4 in 0.5 μm okadaic acid (OA) for 10–30 min largely blocked the effect of β4 on channel activation (Fig.2 A). This difference in channel activation kinetics is better revealed in the normalized current (normalized to the maximum current amplitude) as shown in Fig.2 B. Treatment of cells expressing both β4 andslo with OA decreased the time constant of slochannel activation, although the time constant of activation is still greater than that in cells expressing slo alone. These differences in slo channel activation are quantified in Fig.2 C. In cells expressing both slo and β4, OA treatment reduced the time constant of slo channel activation from 2.3 ± 0.2 to 1.5 ± 0.2 ms (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2 C). The same OA treatment in cells expressing slo alone did not significantly change channel activation (p > 0.5) (Fig. 2 C). The effect of OA treatment on slo channel activation kinetics could be due to a change in the phosphorylation state of either the slo channel or the β4 subunit. We tried to distinguish these two possibilities by mutating all three putative phosphorylation residues in hβ4 to alanines (the β4 AAA mutation). The β4 AAA mutant increased the activation time constant to the same extent as the wild-type β4 (p > 0.05) (Fig.2 D). Interestingly, in cells expressing both sloand β4AAA, OA treatment did not alter the effect of β4 AAA onslo channel activation (Fig. 2 D). The results with okadaic acid treatment and β4 AAA mutation suggest that phosphorylation of β4 could dynamically modulate the functional interaction between β4 and theslo channel. To test this hypothesis further, and to determine the critical phosphorylation site in β4, we mutated the three potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites individually and in combination. Mutation to alanine removes any possibility of that residue being phosphorylated, and mutation to a negatively charged amino acid is assumed to mimic phosphorylation. Cells were transfected with slo and wild-type β4 or various mutant β4s, and the time constant of slo channel activation was measured. As shown in Fig. 3 A, mutating all three phosphorylation sites to negatively charged residues (β4 DEE) largely suppressed the effect of β4 on slo channel activation. The single mutation β4 S17E was sufficient to suppress the effect of β4 on slo channel activation. Neither the single mutation T11D nor the single mutation S210E had any effect on the functional interaction between β4 and the slo channel (data not shown). These data are quantified in Fig. 3 B. The triple mutation β4 DEE decreased the effect of β4 on the time constant of slo channel activation; the time constant of activation was 2.3 ± 0.2 ms for the wild-type β4 and 1.0 ± 0.1 ms for the β4 DEE mutation (p < 0.001) (Fig.3 B). The time constant of activation for the triple mutation β4 DEE was still greater than that for slo alone (p < 0.002). The single mutation β4 S17E suppressed the effect of β4 on channel activation; in the presence of β4 S17E the activation time constant was 1.6 ± 0.2 ms (p< 0.01) (Fig. 3 B). This effect of the single mutation β4 S17E is similar to that of OA treatment (p > 0.7) (compare Figs. 2 B and 3 B). Mutating Ser-17 to alanine had no effect on the action of hβ4 on channel activation (Fig. 3 B). Co-expressing β4 with the slochannel slowed slo channel deactivation (Fig.1 F). We tested whether the effect of β4 on the deactivation kinetics of the slo channel is also modulated by phosphorylation of the β4 subunit. Preincubating cells expressing both slo and β4 in 0.5 μm OA for 10–30 min did not alter the effect of β4 on the time constant of slochannel deactivation (p > 0.2) (Fig.4, A and B). OA treatment also did not change the time constant of slochannel deactivation in cells expressing slo alone (Fig.4 B). However, when we mutated all three putative serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in β4 to negatively charged residues (β4 DEE mutation), the effect of β4 on the deactivation kinetics of theslo channel was eliminated (Fig.5, A and B). In cells expressing both slo and the triple mutation β4 DEE, the time constant of slo channel deactivation was 1.3 ± 0.3 ms, which was significantly different from that in cells expressing slo and wild-type β4 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 5 B). The single mutation β4 S17E was not sufficient to suppress the effect of β4 on slo channel deactivation kinetics (p > 0.2) (Fig. 5 B). β4 S17A was as effective as wild-type β4 in increasing the deactivation time constant (Fig. 5 B). We showed previously in the inside-out recording configuration that β4 modulates the voltage dependence of the slo channel (11Weiger T.M. Holmqvist M.H. Levitan I.B. Clark F.T. Sprague S. Huang W.J. Ge P. Wang C. Lawson D. Jurman M.E. Glucksmann M.A. Silos-Santiago I. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3563-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions we used in the present study (i.e. the whole-cell recording configuration and overexpression in CHO cells), the current amplitude of theslo channel was so large (up to 20 nA) that an accurate measurement of the current-voltage relationship of the slochannel was impossible. In addition, we had limited our recording to the initial 30 s in order to see the modulation of theslo channel by β4, and this does not allow sufficient time to make the necessary input resistance compensation. Nevertheless, we made an estimate of the voltage dependence of the slochannel in the presence of either wild-type β4 or various mutant β4s. Because the current amplitude of the slo channel was similar under all these conditions, all the I-V measurements were subject to the same magnitude of error. Similar to what we showed with inside-out recordings, β4 shifted the current-voltage relationship curve to more depolarized membrane potentials (Fig.6 A). TheV 12 of slo alone was 14 ± 3.2 mV, which was increased to 40 ± 4.9 mV in the presence of wild-type β4 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 6 B). The same okadaic acid treatment, which suppressed the effect of β4 onslo channel activation kinetics, also significantly suppressed the shift of the I-V curve caused by β4 (p< 0.01). The V 12 of the slo channel in the presence of β4 and OA was 19 ± 5.7 mV. As shown in Fig. 6, the single mutation β4 S17E also significantly suppressed the effect of the β4 subunit on the voltage dependence of the slochannel. The V 12 of the slo channel was decreased from 40 ± 4.9 mV in the presence of the wild-type β4 to 10 ± 3.2 mV in the presence of β4 S17E (p < 0.001) (Fig. 6 B). The triple mutation β4 DEE also suppressed the effect of β4 on slo channel voltage dependence (data not shown). The lack of effect of β4 DEE and β4 S17E on the functional properties of the slo channel could be due to two possibilities. The mutant β4 subunits may not bind to theslo channel; alternatively, they may bind to theslo channel but not interact with it functionally. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we tested the binding between the mutant β4 subunits and the slo channel by co-immunoprecipitation. HEK293 cells were transfected with hslo channel together with wild-type β4 subunit or mutant β4 subunits. The hslo channel was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody recognizing the hslo channel. As shown in Fig. 7, we could detect both the wild-type β4 subunit and all the mutant forms of β4 subunit in the immunoprecipitates. As shown previously (11Weiger T.M. Holmqvist M.H. Levitan I.B. Clark F.T. Sprague S. Huang W.J. Ge P. Wang C. Lawson D. Jurman M.E. Glucksmann M.A. Silos-Santiago I. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3563-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there were two bands on the Western blot corresponding to the epitope-tagged β4 subunit and a higher molecular weight form of the β4 subunit. This higher molecular weight band was seen for both the wild-type β4 subunit and the β4 DEE and β4 S17E mutants, although it was largely reduced in the β4 AAA mutant (Fig. 7). The identity of this second band is unknown, but we currently are investigating it. In any event, it is clear that the β4 mutants we used in the present study still bind to theslo channel, and thus a lack of binding cannot account for the functional differences we observe. We also examined the phosphorylation of β4 directly using radioactive 32P labeling of transfected cells. When wild-type β4 was co-expressed with hSlo in HEK293 cells and the hSlo protein was immunoprecipitated, we could detect a 32P-labeled band in the immunoprecipitate corresponding to the molecular weight of β4 (Fig. 8). In contrast, there was no32P-labeled band of this molecular weight when hSlo was expressed alone in HEK293 cells (Fig. 8). This demonstrates that β4 is indeed a phosphoprotein. There are multiple potential intracellular phosphorylation sites in the β4 sequence, including the three serine/threonine residues on which we have focused and an additional threonine and two tyrosine residues. The triple alanine mutation (β4 AAA) reduced the 32P label in β4, confirming that one or more of these mutated residues is phosphorylated (Fig. 8). However there is still substantial 32P label associated with β4 AAA (Fig. 8), suggesting that some or all of the other potential residues are also phosphorylated and contribute to the total 32P signal we observe. The function of an ion channel can be modulated by its associated auxiliary subunits. We show here that the functional interaction between the α subunit of the slo channel and the β4 subunit is itself subject to modulation. Phosphorylation of the β4 subunit dynamically modulates its functional coupling to the α subunit. This provides strong evidence that the protein complex associated with this ion channel is subject to dynamic modulation. We showed previously that the slo channel α subunit binds tightly to its β4 subunit (11Weiger T.M. Holmqvist M.H. Levitan I.B. Clark F.T. Sprague S. Huang W.J. Ge P. Wang C. Lawson D. Jurman M.E. Glucksmann M.A. Silos-Santiago I. DiStefano P.S. Curtis R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3563-3570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This physical interaction is stable, because it is maintained during co-immunoprecipitation in detergent solution. When co-expressed in HEK293 or CHO cells, β4 dramatically modulates the kinetic behavior and toxin sensitivity of theslo channel. There are three putative serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in the β4 subunit, and we tested whether β4 could be phosphorylated and the α−β interaction could be modulated. For this purpose, we employed the whole-cell recording configuration in the present study. Similar to what we saw previously with recording from inside-out patches, the activation and deactivation kinetics of whole-cell slo current are modulated by β4. Interestingly, the modulation of slo channel activation kinetics is only observed within the 1st min of recording. This suggests that after going into the whole-cell mode, either theslo channel α subunit and/or the β4 subunit is modified, and the functional interaction between them disappears. This time-dependent phenomenon is currently being investigated. Native KCa channels in neurons, smooth muscles, and endocrine tissues have all been shown to be modulated by phosphorylation (4Bielefeldt K. Jackson M.B. J. Physiol.

Neuron. 1989; 2: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) classified the neuronal large conductance KCa channels into two types according to channel kinetics. These two types of channel also respond differently to PKA treatment. The open probability of type 1 KCa channels is increased by PKA, whereas the open probability of type 2 KCa channels is decreased by PKA (24Reinhart P.H. Chung S. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pore-forming α subunits of KCachannels have numerous phosphorylation sites. For example, serine 942 is a consensus site for PKA phosphorylation in Drosophila slo (27Wang J. Zhou Y. Wen H. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although mutating this residue does not block the PKA modulation of slofunction. 3Y. Zhou and I. B. Levitan, manuscript in preparation. It is also conceivable that part of the diverse response of KCachannels to protein kinase modulation is due to their association with different β subunits. The data presented here strongly support this hypothesis. When cells expressing slo channel α subunit alone were treated with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and 2A (38Sheppeck J.E. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), there was no significant change in channel activity. On the other hand, when we treated cells expressing both slo α subunit and β4 subunit with okadaic acid, a dramatic suppression of the effect of β4 on slo current activation kinetics and voltage dependence was observed. This suppression effect is likely to be due to changes in phosphorylation of the β4 subunit. First, mutating all three putative serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in β4 to alanines abolishes this effect of okadaic acid treatment. Second, mutating all three sites to negatively charged residues, or even the single mutation S17E, mimics the effect of okadaic acid treatment. The phosphorylation of β4 thus seems sufficient for uncoupling this functional interaction with the α subunit. The loss of functional interaction between the β4 subunit and theslo channel α subunit in the present study is not likely due to dissociation of the two proteins. This is supported by the co-immunoprecipitation experiments that show that the mutant β4 subunits bind to the slo α subunit as well as does the wild-type β4. The results of these biochemical experiments also suggest that mutations of the putative phosphorylation residues did not grossly alter the structure of the β4 protein. The effect of these β4 mutations on the modulation of the slo channel thus must be due to alteration of functional interactions between these two channel subunits. Our data suggest that the activation kinetics, deactivation kinetics, and voltage dependence of the slo channel are differentially modulated. For example, the time constant of slo channel activation decreases with time after going into whole-cell recording mode, whereas the time constant of slo channel deactivation does not change with time. It was also noted that the triple mutation β4 DEE influenced not only the effect of β4 on slochannel activation kinetics and voltage dependence but also the effect of β4 on slo channel deactivation (Figs. 3 and 5). In contrast, the single mutation β4 S17E or OA treatment altered the effect of β4 only on the activation kinetics and voltage dependence of the slo channel. These differential effects on activation kinetics, deactivation kinetics, and voltage dependence are summarized in Table II. One possible explanation is that uncoupling the effect of β4 subunit on slo channel deactivation kinetics may require phosphorylation of β4 on multiple residues, and this is not mimicked in the single mutation β4 S17E or achieved by OA treatment. These results suggest that different kinetic parameters of the slo channel can be modulated by fine-tuning of the phosphorylation state of the β4 subunit.Table IISummary of the effect of β4 mutations and okadaic acid treatment on the functional coupling between β4 and the slo channelTreatmentPhosphorylation level of β4τactivationτdeactivationV 1/2mgslo + hβ4No treatmentNo changeBaselineBaselineBaselineOkadaic acid↑↓No change↓slo + hβ4DEENo treatment↑↑↓↓↓↓↓↓slo + hβ4S17ENo treatment↑↓No change↓↓slo + hβ4S17ANo treatmentNo change/↓No changeNo changeNo changeslo + hβ4AAANo treatmentNo change/↓No changeNo changeNo changeOkadaic acidNo change/↓No changeNo changeNo changeThe activation time constant, deactivation time constant, andV 1/2 mg in cells expressing slo and wild-type β4, without okadaic acid treatment, are defined as base line and are compared with those in other groups.

We found by 32P labeling that hβ4 is indeed a phosphoprotein, and the β subunits of some Kv channels and of L-type Ca2+ channels have been shown to be modulated by phosphorylation (32Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33851-33854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 34Kwak Y.G. Hu N. Wei J. George A.L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. Murray K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13928-13932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It was also shown that phosphorylation of Kv1.1 α subunit at a specific residue is necessary for the channel to be sensitive to Kvβ1.1-induced fast inactivation (39Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29321-29328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similarly, the fast inactivation of Kv1.5 conferred by Kvβ1.3 is modulated by PKA activation, but in this case the effect of PKA is mediated by phosphorylation of the Kvβ1.3 subunit (34Kwak Y.G. Hu N. Wei J. George A.L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. Murray K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13928-13932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PKA activation increases L-type Ca2+ channel activity, and this modulation is at least partially mediated by the phosphorylation of the Ca2+channel β2 subunit, because mutating two serine residues in the β2 subunit blocked this up-regulation of the L-type Ca2+channel by PKA (32Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Gao T. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33851-33854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These data, together with the present results implicating phosphorylation in the functional interaction between theslo channel and its β4 subunit, provide strong evidence that the interaction between pore-forming α subunits and auxiliary subunits can be subject to dynamic regulation. Such dynamic regulation of subunit interactions thereby provides another mechanism for generating diversity of ion channel function. It will be interesting to determine how this type of modulation is utilized under physiological conditions. We thank Drs. Larry Salkoff and Steve Dworetzky for the hSlo1 cDNA.

However, they differ widely in their sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition. Thus, pig l-CPTI has an IC50 for malonyl-CoA of 141 nm, while that of rat L-CPTI is 2 μm. Using chimeras between rat L-CPTI and pig L-CPTI, we show that the entire C-terminal region behaves as a single domain, which dictates the overall malonyl-CoA sensitivity of this enzyme. The degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity is determined by the structure adopted by this domain. Using deletion mutation analysis, we show that malonyl-CoA sensitivity also depends on the interaction of this single domain with the first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues. We conclude that pig and rat L-CPTI have different malonyl-CoA sensitivity, because the first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues interact differently with the C-terminal domain. This is the first study that describes how interactions between the C- and N-terminal regions can determine the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of L-CPTI enzymes using active C-terminal chimeras.

This is the initial step in the entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, where they undergo β oxidation. This is also the first rate-limiting step in fatty acid oxidation in all tissues and is highly regulated by its physiological inhibitor, malonyl-CoA (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Inhibition of CPTI by malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, allows the cell to coordinate fatty acid oxidation and synthesis (2Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Understanding the regulation of CPTI by malonyl-CoA is important since this enzyme is a potential pharmacological target in type 2 diabetes, where excessive fatty acid oxidation is undesirable and must be controlled. There are two isotypes of CPTI: a liver (L-CPTI) and a muscle (M-CPTI) isotype. Both genes encode for proteins, which share a high degree of identity but that differ markedly in their kinetic characteristics. L-CPTI has a much lower K mfor carnitine and a higher IC50 for malonyl-CoA inhibition than the muscle isotype (1McGarry J.D. Brown N.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). These kinetic characteristics of the liver and muscle enzymes are also retained when the cDNAs are expressed in a heterologous system (3Brown N.F. Esser V. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26438-26442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zhu H. Shi J. de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Arch. Biochem.

CPTI is an integral membrane protein that has two α-helical hydrophobic transmembrane domains, the amino and most of the carboxyl regions being exposed to the cytosolic face of the membrane (7Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the first 18 N-terminal amino acids of L-CPTI play a critical role in malonyl-CoA sensitivity since deletion of this region leads to loss of inhibition by malonyl-CoA (8Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Further work demonstrated that this region acts as a positive determinant of malonyl-CoA sensitivity, while amino acids 19–30 act as a negative determinant (9Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the first 18 amino acids of rat L-CPTI and M-CPTI are identical, the role of the M-CPTI N-terminal residues in determining malonyl-CoA sensitivity is different (10Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Pig L-CPTI encodes for a 772-amino acid protein that shares 86 and 63% identity with rat L-CPTI and human M-CPTI, respectively. When expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, the pig L-CPTI enzyme shows kinetic characteristics similar to human or rat L-CPTI (11Nicot C. Hegardt F.G. Woldegiorgis G. Haro D. Marrero P.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2260-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the pig enzyme, unlike the rat liver enzyme, shows a much higher sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition that is characteristic of human or rat M-CPTI enzymes (10Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Nicot C. Hegardt F.G. Woldegiorgis G. Haro D. Marrero P.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2260-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, pig L-CPTI behaves like a natural chimera of the L- and M-CPTI isotypes, which makes it a useful model to study the structure-function relationships of the CPTI enzymes (11Nicot C. Hegardt F.G. Woldegiorgis G. Haro D. Marrero P.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2260-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because the sequence identity between the pig and rat L-CPTIs is high, we predicted that chimeric proteins that combine segments of the C-terminal domain from pig and rat L-CPTIs would be active. Thus, in this study, we focused our attention on changes in malonyl-CoA sensitivity observed in chimeric pig and rat L-CPTI enzymes. In addition, we also studied the presence of positive and negative determinants of malonyl-CoA sensitivity in the N-terminal region of pig L-CPTI and the putative role of such determinants in the observed aberrant kinetic behavior of this enzyme. Pig L-CPTI and rat L-CPTI were subcloned into pHW010, generating PLCPTI/pHW010 and RLCPTI/pHW010 as previously described (11Nicot C. Hegardt F.G. Woldegiorgis G. Haro D. Marrero P.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2260-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.S. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To generate the chimeras, a HindIII site (shown in italics in the primer sequence below) was introduced into the cDNAs of both enzymes by overlap extension. Both cDNAs were modified using the same strategy: two independent PCRs (15 cycles each) were performed with primers A (5′-CTCCCTGAAGCTTCTGCTCTCCTAC-3′) and B (5′-CGTAGTTGCTGTTCACC-3′), and primers C (5′-GCCTTTCAGTTCACGGTCAC-3′) and D (5′-GTAGGAGAGCAGAAGCTTCAGGGAG-3′) using the pig and rat L-CPTI cDNAs as templates. In the subsequent overlap extension reaction, 200 ng of each PCR product was annealed and reamplified for a further 15 cycles of PCR using primers A and D. The resulting PCR products were digested with BglII and cloned into eitherBglII-cut PLCPTI/pHW010 or BglII-cut RLCPTI/pHW010, generating Pig- and Rat-V128L/pHW010. This resulted in the introduction of a point mutation, valine to leucine, at position 128. This mutation did not affect the kinetic characteristics of the enzymes (results not shown). To construct the pig/rat and rat/pig L-CPTI chimeras, Pig- and Rat-V128L/pHW010 were digested with EcoRI to remove the inserts that were subcloned into EcoRI-cut BSSK+. The resulting plasmids, Pig- and Rat-V128L/BSSK+ were digested with HindIII. The restriction enzyme HindIII cuts Pig- and Rat-V128L/pHW010 before the ATG start codon of the insert, and the pig and rat cDNA inserts at position 384 after the ATG start codon. The insert from the digested Pig-V128L/BSSK+ was ligated intoHindIII-cut Rat-V128L/BSSK+ and vice versa, resulting in Pig/Rat and Rat/Pig inserts in BSSK+. The two inserts were then released and subcloned into EcoRI-cut pHW010. A Rat/Pig-A L-CPTI chimera was generated from Pig-V128L/BSSK+. Pig-V128L/BSSK+ was digested with KpnI that cuts before the ATG start codon of the insert and the pig L-CPTI cDNA at position 660. This insert was subcloned into KpnI-cut Rat-V128L/BSSK+, resulting in the plasmid Pig/Rat3/BSSK+. Rat-V128L/BSSK+ was cut with HindIII. HindIII cuts Rat-V128L/BSSK+ before the ATG start codon of the insert and the rat L-CPTI cDNA at position 384. This insert was purified and subcloned in the correct orientation into KpnI-cut Pig/Rat3/BSSK+, resulting in Rat/PigA/BSSK+. The insert from Rat/PigA/BSSK+ was excised by digestion with EcoRI and ligated in the correct orientation intoEcoRI-cut pHW010, resulting in Rat/Pig-A L-CPTI in pHW010. Rat/Pig-B was generated from Pig-V128L/BSSK+. Pig-V128L/BSSK+ was cut with XhoI andStuI. XhoI cuts Pig-V128L/BSSK+before the ATG start codon, and StuI cuts the insert at position 1770 after the start codon. This insert was purified and cloned in the correct orientation intoXhoI/StuI-cut Rat-V128L/BSSK+, resulting in Pig/Rat2/BSSK+. Rat-V128L/BSSK+was cut with KpnI that cuts Rat-V128L/BSSK+before the ATG start codon of the insert and the rat cDNA at position 660. This insert was purified and cloned in the correct orientation into KpnI-cut Pig/Rat2/BSSK+, generating Rat/PigB in BSSK+. The insert from Rat/PigB/BSSK+ was excised with EcoRI and ligated in the correct orientation into EcoRI-cut pHW010, resulting in Rat/Pig-B L-CPTI cDNA in pHW010. Rat/Pig-C was generated from Rat-V128L/BSSK+. Rat-V128L/BSSK+ was cut with XhoI andStuI. XhoI cuts Rat-V128L/BSSK+before the ATG start codon, and StuI cuts the insert at position 1770 after the start codon. This insert was purified and subcloned in the correct orientation intoXhoI/StuI-cut Pig-V128L/BSSK+, resulting in Rat/Pig-C in BSSK+. The insert from Rat/Pig-C in BSSK+ was excised with EcoRI and ligated in the correct orientation into EcoRI-cut pHW010, resulting in Rat/Pig-C in pHW010. To generate Δ18Pig, the pig L-CPTI cDNA was amplified with the primers Δ18fwd (5′-GACATCGAATTC ATGATCGACCTTCGAATGAGC-3′) and primer D. An ATG start codon (shown in bold) was added immediately after the EcoRI site (shown in italics). The PCR product was cloned into EcoRV-cut BSSK+, resulting in the plasmid Δ18/BSSK+. Pig-V128L/BSSK+ was cut with AatII andNotI. AatII cuts the insert at position 508, andNotI cuts Pig-V128L/BSSK+ after the stop codon. The resulting plasmid, Δ18Pig/BSSK+, was digested withEcoRI, and the insert was cloned into EcoRI-cut pHW010, generating Δ18Pig/pHW010. Δ28Pig was generated in the same way but using the primer Δ28fwd (5′-GACATCGAATTC ATGAGGCAGATCTATCTGTCT-3′) instead of Δ18fwd. Δ18Pig/Rat and Δ28Pig/Rat were generated following the same strategy and using as template Δ18Pig/BSSK+ and Δ28Pig/BSSK+, respectively. Both plasmids were amplified with the primers T7 and primer D. The resulting PCR products were digested with HindIII and EcoRV and cloned intoEcoRV/HindIII-cut Pig/Rat/BSSK+, resulting in Δ18 Pig/Rat and Δ28 Pig/Rat in BSSK+. The insert from Δ18 Pig/Rat and Δ28 Pig/Rat in BSSK+ were excised with EcoRI and ligated in the correct orientation into EcoRI-cut pHW010, resulting in Δ18Pig/Rat and Δ28Pig/Rat in pHW010. All constructs were linearized in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAP) gene promoter by digestion with PagI and integrated into the GAP gene promoter locus of P. pastoris GS115 by electroporation (13Shi J.

Histidine prototrophic transformants were selected on YND (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Difco Laboratories, Inc., Detroit, MI)) plates and grown on YND medium. Mitochondria were isolated by disrupting the yeast cells with glass beads as previously described (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.S. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G.

CPT activity was assayed by the forward exchange method using l-[3H]carnitine as previously described (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.S. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The standard assay reaction mixture contained in a total volume of 0.5 ml: 200 mml-[3H]carnitine (∼10,000 dpm/nmol), 80 μm palmitoyl-CoA, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 1% fatty acid-free albumin, and 40–75 mm KCl with or without malonyl-CoA as indicated. Incubations were performed for 3 min at 30 °C. The K m for palmitoyl-CoA was determined by varying the palmitoyl-CoA concentration in the presence of a fixed molar ratio (6.1:1) of palmitoyl-CoA:albumin as previously described (13Shi J. Zhu H.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in a 6% gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes as previously described (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.S. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G.

Proteins were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). DNA sequencing was performed using the Big DyeTM kit (Applied Biosystems, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructions were performed as described in “Experimental Procedures.” Sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. P. pastoris was chosen as an expression system because it does not have endogenous CPT activity and because other CPT proteins have been successfully expressed using this system (4Zhu H.

All constructs were subcloned in the vector pHW010 and expressed under the control of the GAP gene promoter (6Waterham H.R. Digan M.E. Koutz P.J. Lair S.V. Cregg J.M. Gene. 1997; 186: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Yeast transformants were grown as previously described (12de Vries Y. Arvidson D.S. Waterham H.R. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5285-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). No CPT activity was found in the control yeast strain with the empty vector (data not shown). Pig/Rat and Rat/Pig L-CPTI were constructed as shown in Fig. 1 A by ligating pig and rat L-CPTI together just after the second transmembrane domain. These two chimeras have similar affinity for carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA as the parental wild-type enzymes (TableI). The IC50 of the Pig/Rat L-CPTI construct was similar to that of rat L-CPTI, while the IC50 of the Rat/Pig construct was similar to that of the wild-type pig L-CPTI (Fig. 1 B). We previously showed that pig L-CPTI migrates anomalously faster than its predicted molecular weight on SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis of Pig/Rat and Rat/Pig L-CPTI shows that it is the C-terminal region that dictates the migration pattern of L-CPTI proteins (Fig. 2).Table IActivity and malonyl-CoA sensitivity for yeast-expressed wild type and mutant L-CPTI constructsStrainActivityCarnitinePalmitoyl-CoAnmol/min/mgKm (μm)K m (μm)Wild-typePig L-CPTI5.2 ± 0.6126.3 ± 4.335.4 ± 2.0Rat L-CPTI7.8 ± 0.5100.343.0MutantsPig/Rat7.1 ± 1.2147.6 ± 33.631.5 ± 4.1Rat/Pig18.2 ± 1.9104.6 ± 7.352.0 ± 7.0Rat/Pig-A5.5 ± 05107.0 ± 35.560.0 ± 12.0Rat/Pig-B4.8 ± 05111.0 ± 29.043.3 ± 8.0Rat/Pig-C6.5 ± 0.7110.7 ± 28.045.1 ± 9.0Δ1812.3 ± 1.382.7 ± 8.163.0 ± 5.4Δ2812.7 ± 0.797.0 ± 10.361.8 ± 14.2Δ18 Pig/Rat8.5 ± 0.6123.6 ± 9.349.7 ± 6.2Δ28 Pig/Rat8.7 ± 1.2101.7 ± 8.747.4 ± 5.3Mitochondria (100 μg) from the yeast strains expressing wild-type or L-CPTI chimeras were assayed for CPT activity and kinetic parameters as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each construct was assayed at least three times with at least two independent mitochondrial preparations.

To construct carboxyl-end chimeras, the C-terminal region was divided into three discrete regions: region A, from the second transmembrane domain (amino acid 128) to amino acid 220; region B, from amino acid 220–590; and region C, from amino acid 590 to the end. The three carboxyl-end chimeras were based on rat L-CPTI in which regions A, B, or C were substituted by the corresponding region of pig L-CPTI, generating Rat/Pig-A, Rat/Pig-B and Rat/Pig-C (Fig.3 A). Rat/Pig-A, -B, and -C were expressed in P. pastoris, and mitochondria were isolated from the yeast strains expressing each construct and tested for activity and malonyl CoA sensitivity. The chimeras were all active, with similar specific CPT activities and similar affinity for carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA as the parental wild-type enzymes (Table I). Fig.3 B shows that Rat/Pig-A, -B, and -C were all sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition, indicating that all these chimeras have a functional malonyl-CoA binding site. Fig. 3 B also shows that, surprisingly, the three C-terminal region chimeras had malonyl-CoA sensitivity similar to that of wild-type pig L-CPTI. Statistical analysis showed that the difference in malonyl-CoA sensitivity between pig L-CPTI, Rat/Pig-A, Rat/Pig-B, and Rat/Pig-C were not statistically different (p = 0.118). Fig. 4 shows that two of the C-terminal region chimeras, Rat/Pig-A and -C, migrated on SDS-PAGE gels according to their molecular weights, while Rat/Pig-B chimera migrated fasted than expected form the predicted molecular weight. Thus, in our hands, Rat/Pig-A and -C are the first CPTI analyzed chimeras in which there is not a direct correlation between an anomalous protein migration pattern on SDS-PAGE with a high degree of enzyme sensibility to malonyl-CoA inhibition (Fig. 3 B). Four N-terminal deletion mutants, Δ18 Pig, Δ18 Pig/Rat, Δ28 Pig, and Δ28 Pig/Rat, were expressed in P. pastoris. Mitochondria isolated from the yeast strains expressing each of the deletion mutants (Fig.5 A) had specific activity of 12.3 ± 1.3, 8.5 ± 0.6, 12.7 ± 0.7, and 8.7 ± 1.2 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. The four deletion mutants were highly insensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition (Fig. 5 B), but statistical difference was observed in regards to malonyl-CoA sensitivity between Δ18 or Δ18 Pig/Rat versus Δ28 or Δ28 Pig/Rat (Fig. 5). They migrated on SDS-PAGE gels according to their molecular weight (Fig. 6), taking into account the anomalous migration pattern of the parental protein in the case of Δ18 Pig and Δ28 Pig (Fig. 6).Figure 6Immunoblots showing expression of wild-type and deletion mutants L-CPTI enzymes in the yeast P. pastoris.

Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), while that of rat L-CPTI is 2 μm (8Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11033-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To date all studies using chimeric proteins have been performed using combinations of L-CPTI and M-CPTI (9Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19560-19566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G.

Interpretation of such studies has often been difficult because the liver and muscle isotype have only 62% sequence identity, and they differ in both their affinity for carnitine and sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition. Moreover, chimeric proteins of the 197 N-terminal amino acid residues between rat L-CPTI and human M-CPTI were reported to be inactive (10Shi J. Zhu H. Arvidson D.N. Woldegiorgis G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), probably because of the low degree of identity (62%) between the L-CPTI and M-CPTI isotypes. To perform a functional study of the C-terminal domain of L-CPTI proteins, we constructed chimeric proteins between pig and rat L-CPTI proteins. We predicted these chimeras would be active because pig and rat L-CPTI share a high degree of identity (86%) compared with 62% identity between rat L-CPTI and human/rat M-CPTI, making it more likely that the resulting C-terminal chimeras would be active. Moreover, pig and rat L-CPTI only differ in their degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity, which makes a chimeric protein between the two proteins a good tool to study the regulation of L-CPTI by malonyl-CoA. Pig/Rat and Rat/Pig L-CPTI chimeras have the same K mvalues for carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA as the parental proteins, which predicts that the active site of these chimeric proteins is similar to that of the parental proteins (Table I), thus suggesting that they adopt a similar active site conformation as the corresponding wild-type enzymes. The IC50 values for malonyl CoA inhibition of these two constructs shows that the C-terminal region dictates the degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the overall enzyme (Fig.1 B). This is in agreement with the results obtained from chimeric proteins between rat L-CPTI and human/rat M-CPTI (9Jackson V.N. Cameron J.M. Fraser F. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol.

Haro D. Marrero P.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2260-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) migrate faster on SDS gel electrophoresis than their predicted molecular weight. Since, these proteins maintain their anomalous migration pattern when producedin vitro, it is predicted that this phenomenon stems from intrinsic differences in the primary sequence of the two proteins. Western blot analysis of the Pig/Rat and Rat/Pig chimeras showed that the C-terminal region dictates the migration pattern of CPTI proteins, since they migrate according to their C-terminal region (Fig. 2). We predict that differences in the primary sequence of the C-terminal region of these proteins makes them adopt a conformation resistant to denaturation by SDS and thus causes the proteins to migrate faster than their predicted molecular weight. The three carboxyl end chimeric proteins, Rat/Pig-A, Rat/Pig-B, and Rat/Pig-C, were active, allowing kinetic determination of C-terminal region chimeric proteins. Surprisingly, substitution of small rat L-CPTI fragments with the corresponding pig L-CPTI fragment (92, 370, and 183 amino acid residues for Rat/Pig-A, -B, and -C, respectively) was sufficient to confer high malonyl-CoA sensitivity to the rat L-CPTI (Fig. 3 B). This result suggests the following. (i) None of the A, B, or C region is by itself uniquely responsible for the degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the enzyme. Substitution of any of these regions of pig L-CPTI with the corresponding region of rat L-CPTI generates enzymes with malonyl-CoA sensitivity similar to that of the wild-type pig L-CPTI enzyme. This indicates that the C-terminal region of L-CPTI proteins behave as a single domain, which dictates the malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the enzyme. (ii) None of the chimeric proteins studied had a malonyl-CoA sensitivity value intermediate between that of wild-type pig and rat L-CPTI. All of them behaved like one of the parental (pig or rat) L-CPTI proteins, suggesting that the L-CPTI C-terminal region adopts two distinct structures: a low and a high malonyl-CoA sensitivity state. The high malonyl-CoA sensitivity state seems to be more susceptible to change into the low malonyl-CoA sensitivity state but not vice versa. The finding that the entire C-terminal region of L-CPTI behaves as a single domain is in agreement with previous proteolytic studies with intact rat liver mitochondria. Early studies (17Esser V. Britton C.H. Weis B.C. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5817-5822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that trypsin/chymotrypsin treatment of membrane-bound L-CPTI lead to a rapid decrease of activity but that this effect was partially overcome by malonyl-CoA binding. When L-CPTI was subjected to trypsin/chymotrypsin treatment in the presence of malonyl-CoA, the enzyme remained active, although a single 8-kDa fragment was liberated. The authors concluded that this 8-kDa fragment was not essential for catalytic function; however, at that stage further interpretation of these results was not possible. Using the current knowledge on L-CPTI structure and our results, we predict that the 8-kDa fragment liberated upon trypsin/chymotrypsin treatment is probably the extreme N-terminal region of L-CPTI (the first ∼70 N-terminal amino acid residues) and that binding of malonyl-CoA to the enzyme may further tighten the highly folded state of the C-terminal domain, thus rendering it more inaccessible to trypsin/chymotrypsin treatment. Other studies showed that L-CPTI is highly resistant to proteolytic digestion at low, non-membrane disrupting concentrations of the proteases, suggesting that CPTI, and more specifically the C-terminal region, is highly folded (7Fraser F. Corstorphine C.G. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Cohen I. Kohl C. McGarry J.D. Girard J. Prip-Buus C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29896-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previous reports by others and us correlated high sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition of M-CPTI and pig L-CPTI with the anomalous SDS migration pattern of the enzyme (4Zhu H. Shi J. de Vries Y. Arvidson D.N. Cregg J.M. Woldegiorgis G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Nicot C. Hegardt F.G. Woldegiorgis G. Haro D. Marrero P.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6972-6977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, chimeras that share the carboxyl end of pig or rat L-CPTI (Rat/Pig-A and Rat/Pig-C) show a high degree of sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition with a normal SDS migration pattern (Figs. 3 B and 4). These results suggest that the primary structure of the enzyme plays a role in determining the sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition independently of its role in the overall structure. The fact that Δ18 Pig is more sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition than the Δ28 Pig provides evidence that the extreme N-terminal region of pig L-CPTI contains positive (amino acids 1–18) and negative (amino acids 19–28) determinants of malonyl-CoA sensitivity, like rat L-CPTI (19Jackson V.N. Zammit V.A. Price N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38410-38416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hence, although pig L-CPTI is highly sensitive to malonyl-CoA inhibition like rat/human M-CPTI that do not have the negative determinant of malonyl-CoA sensitivity, its N-terminal region appears to have the same function as the low malonyl-CoA-sensitive rat L-CPTI. Interestingly, while Pig and Pig/Rat L-CPTI have different malonyl-CoA sensitivity, deletion of the first 28 N-terminal amino acid residues from these two constructs generates enzymes, Δ28 Pig and Δ28 Pig/Rat L-CPTI, which have similar malonyl-CoA sensitivity (Fig.5 B). This suggests that the first 28 amino acid residues determine the difference in malonyl-CoA sensitivity between pig and rat L-CPTIs. The same result was obtained when only the first 18 N-terminal amino acids were deleted (Δ18 Pig and Δ18 Pig/Rat L-CPTI), which suggests that the first 18 N-terminal amino acids are sufficient to determine the difference in malonyl-CoA sensitivity between pig and rat L-CPTIs. In summary, our data demonstrate that (i) the C-terminal end of L-CPTI is a single domain that dictates the degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity of L-CPTI enzymes and (ii) deletion of the first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues of pig and Pig/Rat L-CPTIs generates enzymes with similar IC50 values. This suggests that the first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues and the C-terminal domain interact and that it is this interaction that determines the degree of malonyl-CoA sensitivity of L-CPTI. Since the first 18 N-terminal amino acid residues are identical in pig and rat L-CPTIs, what determines the nature of this interaction is the primary and secondary structure of the C-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W2066808617,"P-type ATPases are a venerable family of ATP-dependent ion transporters. Recently, evidence was presented that a rabbit gene in the type IV subfamily of P-type ATPases was missing a transmembrane helix (transmembrane domain 4) thought to be critical for ion transport, a deletion that would place the two major catalytic loops of the enzyme on opposite sides of the membrane. It was proposed that the resulting protein was a RING finger-binding protein that targets transcription factors to specific domains within the nucleus. From analysis of human genomic sequence data, it is shown here that the region containing transmembrane domain 4, corresponding to exon 12, is present in the human homolog of the gene,ATP11B. PCR analysis indicates that the predominantAtp11b transcripts in a rabbit cDNA library and in a mouse cDNA library also contain exon 12. The results suggest that the transcript proposed to encode the RING finger-binding protein is a minor rabbit-specific splice variant. The ATP11B gene thus may not encode a protein with a function radically different from that of other P-type ATPase transporters."

Kir channels are assemblies of four identical or related subunits. Each subunit contains an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain, which are separated by a pore-forming transmembrane region (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Both the N and C termini are hydrophilic enough to extend from the transmembrane region into the cytoplasm and form a cytoplasmic region (2Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. J.

A. 2001; 98: 4227-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, knowledge about the intracellular vestibule structure of Kir channels is very limited, although it is generally believed that the transmembrane pore extends into the cytoplasmic region to form the vestibule opening to the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic region of Kir channels has various functions that play important roles in controlling Kir channel activity (11Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Therefore, most studies on the cytoplasmic region have been focused on identification of domains and residues involved in these functions. Delineation of the cytoplasmic vestibule structure, however, will allow us to understand the complete structure of Kir channels, and may also provide useful information complementary to studies on the regulatory functions of this region. In Kir2.1, a representative Kir channel that is characterized by strong inward rectification, mutation of a negatively charged residue, Glu-224, hinders voltage-dependent pore plugging by polyvalent cations (12Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 13Taglialatela M. Ficker E. Wible B.A. Brown A.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5532-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), a mechanism causing inward rectification (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). This finding has led to the hypothesis that Glu-224 is a vestibule-lining residue at a critical site that contributes to inward rectification. The hypothesis that Glu-224 is exposed to the vestibule has been confirmed by the substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM; Ref. 14Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) in a study from Yang's group (4Lu T. Zhu Y.G. Yang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which showed that modification of an introduced cysteine at position 224 by charged, membrane-impermeable sulfhydryl-specific reagents irreversibly inhibited the channel current. The vestibule surrounding Glu-224 has such a wide diameter that it could concurrently accommodate four MTS moieties. Residues surrounding Glu-224 were also frequently found to be vestibule lining. Similar analysis, however, has not been reported for other Kir channels. In the Kir1.1 channel, a weak inward rectifier, introducing a glutamic acid at the counterpart of Glu-224 failed to reproduce the inward rectification observed in Kir2.1 channel (12Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Mutation of the residue equivalent to Glu-224 in Kir3.4, a member of another Kir subfamily, also had functional consequence dissimilar to that in Kir2.1 channels (15Lancaster M.K. Dibb K.M. Quinn C.C. Leach R. Lee J.K. Findlay J.B. Boyett M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35831-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These observations, together with the high functional diversity of the cytoplasmic region, raise the question of whether all Kir channels share a vestibule structure similar to that of Kir2.1 channels. The major aim of this study is to investigate the cytoplasmic vestibule architecture of the weak inward rectifier Kir6.2 channel at a site analogous to Glu-224 of Kir2.1. We chose Kir6.2 as our model for several reasons. As the channel-forming subunit of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel that is a critical modulator of insulin secretion and other physiological processes, Kir6.2 has been intensively investigated over the past few years (16Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 17Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Functional roles of many residues in the putative cytoplasmic region of Kir6.2 have been studied by mutagenesis. Kir6.2 has a characteristic weak rectification that distinguishes it from Kir2.1. It also contains an undefined nucleotide-binding site that is probably located in the cytoplasmic region. Binding of ATP to this site closes the channel. This character is particularly useful when events relating to channel gating are studied. Our strategy includes several approaches to determine whether Ser-212, the residue at the position analogous to Glu-224, is a pore-lining residue. Because this has proven true, we have further explored the physical dimensions of the pore at this location and compared it to the Kir2.1 channel. Most Kir channels are tetramers composed of four independent subunits. Kir6.2 also forms a channel in this way. In the absence of regulatory subunits called sulfonylurea receptors, Kir6.2 is prevented from being expressed on the surface membrane. After removal of a retention signal near the C terminus, Kir6.2 is allowed to traffic to the surface membrane (18Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The channel formed by Kir6.2 has quite different gating kinetics and regulation characteristics in the absence of the sulfonylurea receptor subunits. However, either the single-channel conductance and ionic permeation are unaltered or the alterations are too subtle to detect. It is believed that removal of retention signals from Kir6.2 channels does not affect the main channel pore structures. Thus, the Kir6.2 channel is a simplified model suitable for study of pore properties. In this study, a truncated mutant of Kir6.2, Kir6.2ΔC35, was used as a control background for the exploration of pore structure. Most subsequent mutations were constructed on this background. A modification of Kir6.2ΔC35 containing a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDK) inserted after the first methionine was also used. Compared with Kir6.2ΔC35, this modified channel does not show any detectable difference in major channel functions. Kir6.2ΔC35 and FLAG-Kir6.2ΔC35 channels are both designated as Kir6.2Δ in this paper. Likewise, mutants derived from either control background are not specifically noted, unless indicated. Kir6.2Δ was constructed using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (ExSite, Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) as described previously (19Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Gen.

A double-stranded mutagenesis kit (Chameleon, Stratagene Inc.), was used to generate the desired point mutations following the manufacturer's instructions. In most cases, a silent mutation near the mutation site was created simultaneously to facilitate the selection process. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing at a commercial sequencing facility (Davis Sequencing, LLC, Davis, CA). The resulting mutants, either amplified by maxi-scale production, or collected from mini-scale production, were used in transfection. Plasmids produced by either production method gave satisfactory results. A cDNA encoding an S212C-Kir6.2Δ subunit was constructed on a Kir6.2Δ background. The 3′ end of a cDNA encoding a Kir6.2Δ mutant having double mutations, C42V/S212C, was linked to the 5′ end of a FLAG-Kir6.2Δ construct bridged by a linker of six glycines. The final construct was subcloned into a pCR3.1-Uni mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A COS-1 cell line was maintained in continuous culture. The method for transient transfection of COS-1 cells was as described previously (19Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, Kir6.2Δ and its mutants in mammalian expression vectors were transfected with a NovaFECTOR kit (VennNova, LLC, Pompano Beach, FL). The expression of Kir6.2Δ and the mutant channels usually peaked 64–72 h after transfection. The cells were then immediately used for electrophysiological experiments. Methanethiosulfonate reagents are suitable for SCAM of pore-lining cysteines (20Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). MTS reagents used in this study all have the same sulfhydryl reactivation mechanism to allow for comparison of reactivity. When membrane-impermeable MTS reagents substituted with various nonreactive moieties are used, the capacity for these moieties to plug and block the channel after association with target cysteines can help to determine channel size. In the present study, MTSEA, MTSET, MTS-PtrEA, MTS-TEAH, and MTS-EDANS-CE (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., North York, Ontario, Canada) were used. The chemical structures of these reagents are given in Fig. 1. The reagents were either first dissolved in Me2SO, or directly dissolved in solution. The final concentration of Me2SO was less than 0.1%. The dissolved reagents were used immediately (<2 min). Although the actual reactivity of these reagents was not determined, in the early stage of this study we tested various exposure times and concentrations (up to 5 mm) of MTSET, MTSEA, MTS-TEAH, and MTS-PtrEA for their ability to modify Kir6.2Δ and S212C mutant channels. According to these experiments, and other published studies, we decided to use a concentration of 0.6 mm for each reagent and 3 min of modification at room temperature, except when otherwise indicated. The bath solution containing the MTS reagents was applied directly to the intracellular side of excised membrane patch via a gravity-driven perfusion system. It took less than 20 s (an average of ∼5 s) to exchange the bath solution. Other solution exchanges were performed using a pressurized perfusion system (DAD-12, ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). The patch clamp and data acquisition system have been described previously (19Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Currents were usually recorded at a membrane potential of 0 mV. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Digitized current signals were manually corrected for base-line drift using pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, CA). Average currents were measured in a 10–20-s time window. When single-channel events were analyzed, a 50% threshold criterion was used to detect events with visual confirmation. Single-channel current amplitude and kinetics were analyzed using an established method described in our previous work (19Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were blocked with a buffer containing 5% goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.05% azide in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with a secondary Alexa Fluor™ 546 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugate antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 4 h. The stained cells were further incubated with a monoclonal antibody to BiP (Stressgen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) and subsequently stained with Alexa Fluor™ 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugate antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Immunofluorescence staining was viewed with a laser scanning LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Images taken under emission/excitation wavelengths appropriate for two sets of antibodies were superimposed and compared with determine the subcellular localization of the channels. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance test followed by apost hoc Student-Newman-Keuls method was used to examine the statistical differences among all data groups. Student's ttest was used wherever two groups of data are compared. First, the effects of MTS reagents on Kir6.2Δ channel currents were examined. Because a similar protocol was used in many experiments of this study, it is described in detail here. Channel currents were recorded in inside-out patches excised from the transfected COS-1 cells. In most experiments, a patch contained 5–20 active channels at the excision of the patch. MTS reagents were added to the solution that perfused the intracellular side of the membrane. Each reagent was tested in an individual experiment. The first current trace in Fig.2 is a typical recording from a patch having multiple Kir6.2Δ channels. Whenever possible, channel sensitivity to ATP inhibition was tested using ATP concentration steps before and after sulfhydryl modification. Application of MTSET rapidly and completely inhibited the current. The current did not recover after withdrawal of MTSET. MTSEA had the same effect. This effect of MTSET and MTSEA has already been demonstrated in other studies and was absent in C42V mutant channels (trace 2 in Fig. 2) (7Loussouarn G. Makhina E.N. Rose T. Nichols C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,21Trapp S. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, this inhibitory effect is most likely caused by modification of Cys-42. Results from our laboratory suggest that modification of Cys-42 by MTSET does not directly occlude the pore (see “Discussion” for more details). In contrast to MTSET and MTSEA, application of MTS-TEAH, MTS-PtrEA, and MTS-EDANS-CE did not irreversibly inhibit Kir6.2Δ channel current (traces 3–5 in Fig. 2). The channels remained active after withdrawal of the reagents. It should be noted that a time-dependent run-down component was usually present in most experiments, which led to a lower channel activity after the treatment than before the treatment. This bias should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results of sequential measurements. We consistently observed that MTS-TEAH reversibly reduced Kir6.2Δ channel activity; this activity was almost fully recovered after withdrawal of the reagent. Examination of the single-channel current amplitude and kinetics revealed that the reversible channel current reduction was because of a decrease in the probability of a channel being open without significant change in single-channel amplitude. Repeating the same experiment at −80 mV in the presence of 140 mm symmetric [K+] across the membrane resulted in less reduction, suggesting that the effect was probably because of a voltage-dependent block by positively charged MTS-TEAH. Voltage-dependent reduction of open channel probability caused by some positively charged channel blocking reagents such as tetraethylammonium has been described previously (22Davies N.W. Spruce A.E. Standen N.B. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol. 1989; 413: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Fan Z. Nakayama K. Hiraoka M. J. Physiol. 1990; 430: 273-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because MTS-TEAH, MTS-PtrEA, and MTS-EDANS-CE do not irreversibly inhibit Kir6.2Δ channels, they can be used to study channel structure in substituted cysteine mutants. The effects of these reagents on S212C mutant channels were therefore examined. In contrast to Kir6.2Δ channels, MTS-TEAH and MTS-PtrEA irreversibly inhibited S212C channel currents. Fig.3 A gives representative current recordings from these experiments. We were unable to reverse these effects with 5 mm DTT. When 50 mm DTT was applied, the effect of MTS-TEAH was partially reversed in one patch. Why DTT cannot effectively reverse the effects of MTS reagents is unclear. Perhaps access of DTT to the disulfide bonds is obstructed in a narrow space filled by MTS moieties. MTS-EDANS-CE, which has the largest space-filling moiety of all MTS reagents tested in this study, did not affect S212C channel activity. Because MTSET and MTSEA irreversibly inhibit Kir6.2Δ channel current but not C42V channel current, a mutant containing both C42V and S212C mutations (named C42V/S212C) was constructed to eliminate the confounding effects of MTS modification of C42. The C42V/S212C mutant channels had current activity comparable with Kir6.2Δ and C42V channels. Interestingly, neither application of MTSET or MTSEA irreversibly inhibited the channel, in contrast to MTS-TEAH and MTS-PtrEA (Fig. 3, B and C). We also examined the effects of the other three reagents on the C42V/S212C mutant channel. The results illustrated in Fig. 3 B are in good agreement with those obtained in the S212C mutant channel. The results summarized in Fig. 3 C clearly indicate that irreversible channel inhibition by MTS-TEAH and MTS-PtrEA was attributable to modification of Cys-212. These experiments, however, did not distinguish whether the failure of certain reagents to inhibit the channels was because of their inability to modify Cys-212, or whether the modification of Cys-212 occurred but was insufficient to cause channel inhibition. To determine whether the reagents unable to inhibit S212C mutants were able to react with and modify Cys-212, the inhibitory effect of MTS-TEAH was examined after pretreatment of the S212C mutants with the test reagents MTSET, MTSEA, and MTS-EDANS-CE. These tests were performed considering that if the test reagent indeed modifies Cys-212, then this residue cannot be further modified by MTS-TEAH and, as a consequence, MTS-TEAH would no longer be able to inhibit the channel. We first tested MTSET in the C42V/S212C mutant (Fig. 4 A). Pretreatment of the channel with MTSET completely prevented the effect of subsequent application of MTS-TEAH. The difference between the inhibitory effect of MTS-TEAH on the untreated (referring to Fig. 3, B andC) and pretreated channels is statistically significant (Fig. 4 C). MTSEA acted very similarly (repeated in three experiments; result not shown). Unlike MTSET and MTSEA, MTS-EDANS-CE did not prevent the effect of MTS-TEAH on S212C mutant channels (Fig.4, B and C). We therefore conclude that MTSET and MTSEA can access and modify Cys-212 without causing channel inhibition; on the other hand, MTS-EDANS-CE apparently does not react with Cys-212. The data also confirmed that MTS-TEAH indeed modified this Cys residue and that this modification causes channel inhibition in S212C mutants. Variability in current response following modification of pore-lining residues by MTS reagents is expected because reagents must be of an appropriate size to occlude the channel. However, modification of a residue might also close the channel allosterically, even if it does not extend into the permeation pathway. The following experiments were designed to differentiate these two possibilities. Polyamines are known to insert themselves into the inner pore of Kir channels and produce a voltage-dependent block of ion transport (24Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 366-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 25Lopatin A.N. Makhina E.N. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 923-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). MTS reagents that modify a pore-lining residue would project into the permeation pathway and hinder access of polyamines to the binding site(s) within the pore, thus altering their blocking effect. To test this possibility, we examined the blocking effect of spermine before and after modification of S212C mutants by MTSEA. Spermine at 0.1 mm was added to the intracellular side of a membrane that was voltage-clamped under a ramping protocol. The initial holding potential was 0 mV. Constant ramps from the holding potential to −80 mV, then to +100 mV, and returning back to the holding potential during a period of 3.6 s were used. Because alkaline intracellular pH enhances the blocking effect of spermine in Kir6.2 channels (26Baukrowitz T. Tucker S.J. Schulte U. Benndorf K. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we performed these experiments in intracellular solutions of pH 8.0. We confirmed that the voltage-dependent block of Kir6.2Δ channels by spermine was much stronger at pH 8.0 than at 7.3. Higher pH also enhanced the blocking effect of spermine in C42V and C42V/S212C mutant channels to an extent similar to that in Kir6.2Δ channels. In these experiments, more than 12 traces of multiple-channel currents were averaged to obtain macroscopic current that was then plotted against the voltages. As shown in Fig. 5 (A–C), spermine blocked C42V channel currents regardless of MTSEA treatment. In C42V/S212C mutant channels, however, treatment with MTSEA significantly attenuated the voltage-dependent block by spermine (Fig. 5, D–F). The data suggest that Cys-212 is either a part of the spermine binding site or that it is located in the passage through which spermine must pass. In either case, it is clear that Cys-212 must be a pore-lining residue. If moieties of MTS reagents covalently linked to Cys-212 occlude the channel, then one may ask how many such moieties are needed to completely stop the ion flow. To explore this question, a fusion subunit containing an S212C mutant subunit and a Kir6.2Δ subunit was used. As described previously in studies that employed the same strategy to investigate the stoichiometry of channel inhibition (10Loussouarn G. Phillips L.R. Masia R. Rose T. Nichols C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4227-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), two such fusion subunits can form a functional channel composed of two mutant subunits and two Kir6.2Δ subunits at mirror positions around the channel coaxial axis. If more than two modified Cys-212 residues are required to block the channel, then MTS reagents would not irreversibly inhibit the C212S-Kir6.2Δ dimer channels. Fig.6 (B and C) shows examples of experiments using MTS-TEAH and MTS-PtrEA. Neither reagent could irreversibly inhibit the dimer channels (Fig. 6 D). However, modification of the dimer channels by MTS-TEAH attenuated spermine block (Fig. 6 E), further confirming that the modified residues Cys-212 extend into the permeation pathway. Apparently, two moieties derived from either reagent are insufficient to occlude the channel completely. Our SCAM analysis indicated that Ser-212 is a pore-lining residue. Using the same strategy, we examined residues near Ser-212. The residues we have tested are listed in Fig. 7 along with the statistical results. At equilibrium, MTS-TEAH irreversibly reduced channel current of I210C and I211C mutants, whereas MTS-PtrEA significantly reduced channel current of the I211C mutant. It is intriguing that the reagents, at a concentration and time sufficient to inhibit all S212C mutant channels in a patch, only inactivated a fraction of I210C and I211C mutant channels. In addition, the levels of inhibition were quantitatively different between these two mutants. Interestingly, other cysteine substitution mutants listed in Fig. 7 were as insensitive to MTS-TEAH and MTS-PtrEA treatment as control Kir6.2Δ channels. Transfection of T214C did not express recordable current. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 7 C, immunochemical display of subcellular localization of the FLAG-tagged T214C mutants (11 cells) exhibits distribution similar to that of FLAG-Kir6.2Δ channels (12 cells). An important yet unresolved question about Kir channels is whether or not the cytoplasmic vestibule is involved in gating of the channel. So far, there is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that Ser-212 or surrounding residues have such a function. ATP inhibits the Kir6.2 channel through an ATP-sensitive gating mechanism that may involve both transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions (27Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13953-13958Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 28Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29Trapp S. Proks P. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 30Enkvetchakul D. Loussouarn G. Makhina E. Nichols C.G. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the following experiments, we examined whether Ser-212 plays a role in ATP-sensitive inhibition. We first investigated whether ATP could protect Cys-212 from being modified by MTS reagents. As shown in Fig. 8 A, 50 mm ATP was kept in the bath solution to completely inhibit the channel activity during the application of MTS-TEAH. The channel activity, which otherwise would recover spontaneously after removal of ATP, did not recur after MTS-TEAH treatment. Similar observation was repeated in three experiments. In the example shown in Fig.8 A, the channels inhibited by MTS-TEAH treatment were partially recovered by subsequent application of 50 mm DTT. Next, we looked at the influence of mutation and sulfhydryl modification on ATP sensitivity. Qualitative measurement of ATP-sensitive inhibition followed an established protocol (19Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 251-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As noted earlier, ATP-sensitive inhibition was measured before and after treatment with MTS reagents in Kir6.2Δ channels and mutants whenever possible. Fig. 8 B demonstrates how the IC50 for ATP was obtained. Fig. 8 C is the statistical summary and comparison of IC50 for ATP-sensitive inhibition measured from cysteine substitution mutants, before and after treatment with MTS reagents. Cysteine substitution of most residues does not cause any profound change in ATP sensitivity. ATP sensitivity was reduced significantly in G334C and C166S (backward substitution) mutant channels as reported by others (27Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13953-13958Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 29Trapp S. Proks P. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The H186C mutant channel is slightly less sensitive to ATP than Kir6.2Δ channels. Treatment with MTS-TEAH did not change ATP sensitivity in any cysteine substitution mutants scanned in our study. It is also noticeable that ATP sensitivity of C42V/S212C mutant channel was not changed after MTSET treatment. A core finding of this paper is that MTSEA and MTSET cannot irreversibly inhibit the S212C mutant channel constructed on a sulfhydryl reagent-insensitive Kir6.2 background (C42V/S212C). This result is in sharp contrast to the effect of these two MTS reagents on E224C mutant channels on a Kir2.1 background (4Lu T. Zhu Y.G. Yang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This difference could reflect either a global structural difference in the cytoplasmic regions of these two channels, or local variations. Our analysis using MTS reagents of larger size leads to the conclusion that, like Glu-224 of Kir2.1, Ser-212 of Kir6.2 is very possibly a vestibule-lining residue. The results support the central tenet that the cytoplasmic region of Kir channels forms a wide vestibule that contains critical element(s) controlling inward rectification. Results obtained from experiments that utilize irreversible change of current activity in response to sulfhydryl-specific reagents as a reporter of substituted cysteine accessibility, like the one we used in this study, must be interpreted with caution. Absence of channel inhibition by MTS reagents is insufficient to conclude that cysteines are inaccessible, simply because modification by MTS reagents may not necessarily affect the current. We determined that MTSET and MTSEA indeed modified Cys-212 by demonstrating their protective effect against MTS-TEAH (Fig. 4). Likewise, channel inhibition following cysteine modification is not sufficient evidence to identify a pore-lining residue, because inhibition may be caused either by direct blockage, or by allosteric effects. To help identify Cys-212 as a pore-lining residue, we showed that modification of S212C mutants by MTSEA (which itself does not inhibit the mutants) and modification of S212C-Kir6.2Δ dimer channels by MTS-TEAH reduced the voltage-dependent block of the pore by spermine. In contrast, modification of Cys-42 of Kir6.2Δ channel by MTS-TEAH, which does not inhibit the channel either, did not have such an effect. 2Y. Cui and Z. Fan, unpublished observations. We postulate that the change of spermine block may reflect change of the structure or electrostatic profile of the vestibule. Taking this evidence together, we suggest that: MTSEA and MTSET can access and modify Cys-212, but the modification does not lead to channel inhibition, and MTS-PtrEA and MTS-TEAH modify this cysteine and result in channel inhibition via direct pore occlusion. There are, however, two possible interpretations for the ineffectiveness of MTS-EDANS-CE. This reagent may be too large to form a blocking complex in the pore; alternatively, it may not access Cys-212. Based on these analyses and reasonable extrapolation, we conclude that Ser-212 is a putative pore-lining residue, which is most likely in the cytoplasmic vestibule of the channel, as has been proposed for its counterpart in Kir2.1 (4Lu T. Zhu Y.G. Yang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we noted with interest that neither mutation nor modification of the residues under study significantly changed the unitary amplitude of the single-channel current (analysis not shown). This contradicts mutation of Glu-224, which reduces the unitary amplitude of Kir2.1 (12Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1047-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar); modification of putative pore-lining residues in the transmembrane region of Kir6.2 also causes graded changes in the unitary amplitude (10Loussouarn G. Phillips L.R. Masia R. Rose T. Nichols C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4227-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although it requires further experimentation to understand this, we speculate that a wider vestibule surrounding Ser-212 of Kir6.2 may at least partly account for the difference. We also noted that MTS-TEAH produced a reversible block of outward current (e.g. Figs. 2 and 6), but it did not block C42V/S212C channel current after MTSET modification (Fig. 4). MTS-TEAH may act as an inner pore blocker whose access to the reversible blocking site can be hindered by modified Cys-212 in a mechanism similar to that of the MTSEA prevention of spermine block. Information gained from the Cys-212 accessibility reported by channel inhibition after sulfhydryl modification may also be used to estimate the vestibule size near the modified residue. The differences in accessibility shown for MTSET, MTS-TEAH, and MTS-PtrEA suggest a vestibule of at least 20 Å in diameter, if we assume that four identical derivatives of the reagents can be held in this region. If it cannot accommodate four MTS-EDANS-CE derivatives simultaneously, then the vestibule is not wider than 25 Å. This estimate seems close to the estimated vestibule size of Kir2.1 at the analogous location, but the Kir2.1 inhibition by MTSEA reveals a substantial difference between these two channels. We postulate that there may be a constricted region in Kir2.1 that is lacking in the Kir6.2 channel. It should be pointed out, however, that the channel inhibition by MTS reagents reported in this study might have also been effected by other mechanisms, such as an altered electrostatic profile introduced by the charged moieties of modifying reagents, and allosteric change of channel gating caused by modification. These effects could bias the above estimation of the vestibule size. The effects of MTS-TEAH and MTS-PtrEA on cysteine mutants of the residues surrounding Ser-212 exhibit an interesting pattern; two residues next to Ser-212 on the amino side are accessible and can cause channel inhibition, whereas residues on the carboxyl side, Ala-213–Met-217, are insensitive to the reagents. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of MTS-TEAH and MTS-PtrEA were weaker at position 211 and were further reduced at position 210. Although it is difficult to interpret structural information from these results, we propose that a funnel-shaped vestibule at this location can cause this phenomenon. Protection studies combined with polyamine test of these positions may provide clues to their role in the vestibule structure. In addition, Thr-214 may deserve special attention. Mutation of this residue gave no recordable current, but immunochemical staining indicates that the expression of this mutant appears comparable with that of the Kir6.2Δ channel. Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate whether this residue is involved in supporting a conformation needed by the vestibule structure. The cytoplasmic region of Kir6.2 may be involved in modulating channel gating (for example, see Refs. 27Drain P. Li L. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13953-13958Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 28Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M.

In addition, although recent studies suggest that the transmembrane region of Kir channels contains major candidates for gating machinery (9Yi B.A. Lin Y.F. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2001; 29: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 33Choe H. Palmer L.G. Sackin H. Biophys.

Biol. 1998; 5: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), a separate intrinsic gate structure in the cytoplasmic vestibule is also suspected (35Luchian T. Dascal N. Dessauer C. Platzer D. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Schreibmayer W. J. Physiol. 1997; 505: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Based on our results, the region surrounding Ser-212 seems to have little role, if any at all, in these two functions. On the other hand, our data do support the dogma that charged residues projecting into the cytoplasmic vestibule affect inward rectification as revealed by mutational analysis of strong rectifiers (4Lu T. Zhu Y.G. Yang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9926-9931Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 12Yang J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Although Kir6.2 is a weak rectifier, His-216 in the cytoplasmic region has been shown responsible for pH-dependent, spermine-induced rectification; it was postulated that the charged form of His-216 repels spermine from the vestibule (26Baukrowitz T. Tucker S.J. Schulte U. Benndorf K. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Our results provide robust evidence that a charged vestibule-lining residue can affect inward rectification of Kir6.2. We thank Xi He and Dr. Talent I. Shevchenko for participation in construction of Kir6.2 mutants."
