https://openalex.org/W1988326309,"We report a photoactivatable variant of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) that, after intense irradiation with 413-nanometer light, increases fluorescence 100 times when excited by 488-nanometer light and remains stable for days under aerobic conditions. These characteristics offer a new tool for exploring intracellular protein dynamics by tracking photoactivated molecules that are the only visible GFPs in the cell. Here, we use the photoactivatable GFP both as a free protein to measure protein diffusion across the nuclear envelope and as a chimera with a lysosomal membrane protein to demonstrate rapid interlysosomal membrane exchange."

We describe a subset of human APCs that express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and inhibit T cell proliferation in vitro. IDO-positive APCs constituted a discrete subset identified by coexpression of the cell-surface markers CD123 and CCR6. In the dendritic cell (DC) lineage, IDO-mediated suppressor activity was present in fully mature as well as immature CD123 + DCs. IDO + DCs could also be readily detected in vivo, which suggests that these cells may represent a regulatory subset of APCs in humans."

Inflammation induces the expression of SOCS proteins. We show that SOCS1 or SOCS3 targeted IRS1 and IRS2, two critical signaling molecules for insulin action, for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. SOCS1 or SOCS3 bound both recombinant and endogenous IRS1 and IRS2 and promoted their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation in multiple cell types. Mutations in the conserved SOCS box of SOCS1 abrogated its interaction with the elongin BC ubiquitin-ligase complex without affecting its binding to IRS1 or IRS2. The SOCS1 mutants also failed to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of either IRS1 or IRS2. Adenoviral-mediated expression of SOCS1 in mouse liver dramatically reduced hepatic IRS1 and IRS2 protein levels and caused glucose intolerance; by contrast, expression of the SOCS1 mutants had no effect. Thus, SOCS-mediated degradation of IRS proteins, presumably via the elongin BC ubiquitin-ligase, might be a general mechanism of inflammation-induced insulin resistance, providing a target for therapy.

In mice, IRS1 mediates the effects of insulin and IGF1 on somatic cell growth, whereas IRS2 is essential for nutrient homeostasis (3Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S.

However, IRS1−/− mice never develop diabetes because of life-long compensatory hyperinsulinemia, whereas disruption of IRS2 causes severe glucose intolerance and diabetes (4Withers D.J. White M.F. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of IRS2 is especially problematic, because it regulates transcription factors in β-cells that are essential for glucose sensing and insulin secretion (1White M.F. Myers M.G.

Proinflammatory cytokines or insulin activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which promotes serine phosphorylation of IRS1 and IRS2 that inhibits coupling to the activated insulin receptor (12Aguirre V.

Our recent studies reveal that IRS proteins are ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome during insulin stimulation or during cellular stress, but the mechanisms that recruit ubiquitin-ligases to the IRS proteins are unknown (17Rui L.

Insulin resistance is a common consequence of physiological stress, owing at least in part to the production of proinflammatory cytokines during infection or injury, pregnancy, growth and aging, or chronic obesity (19Yuan M.

Many proinflammatory cytokines up-regulate suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, including eight isoforms that contain an NH2-terminal SH2 domain and a COOH-terminal SOCS box (23Yasukawa H.

SOCS proteins bind via their SH2 domains to activated cytokine receptors or their associated Janus kinases as part of a negative feedback loop to attenuate cytokine signaling (24Krebs D.L.

SOCS1 was shown recently to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of vav and JAK2 in a SOCS box-dependent fashion (30De Sepulveda P. Ilangumaran S. Rottapel R. J. Biol.

Several reports suggest that SOCS1, SOCS3, or SOCS6 also inhibit heterologous pathways, including insulin receptor signaling (33Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Chavey C. Freidinger K. Hilton D.J.

In this report, we showed that SOCS1/3 promoted the ubiquitination and degradation of both IRS1 and IRS2. The elongin BC binding motif in SOCS1 and SOCS3 was required for the ubiquitination and degradation of IRS1 and IRS2, revealing a mechanism to inhibit insulin action and promote glucose intolerance during infection, inflammation, or metabolic stress. Protein A-agarose was purchased from Repligen, and aprotinin and leupeptin were from Sigma. The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. FuGENE 6 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA), anti-Myc antibodies, and anti-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Inc. Polyclonal anti-IRS1 antibodies were raised against the PTB domain (JD#228, used at a dilution of 1:100 for immunoprecipitation) or the full-length rat IRS1 (JD#159, used at a dilution of 1:15,000 for immunoblotting). Polyclonal antibodies against IRS2 were also prepared in rabbits immunized with full-length rat IRS2. Plasmids encoding different proteins were transiently cotransfected into HEK293 cells using FuGENE 6 according to manufacturer's instruction. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were deprived of serum overnight and then treated with insulin (100 nm) for 10 min. In parallel experiments, cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection without starvation. Methods for preparation of cell extracts, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation were described previously (17Rui L. Fisher T.L. Thomas J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40362-40367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Mutant SOCS1 (ΔS1) lacking the SOCS box (residues 167–212), or with two point mutations (SLC→PF, L175P, C179F) that disrupt the elongin C binding site were prepared by PCR-based mutagenesis. SOCS1, ΔS1, or SLC→PF was tagged with HA at its COOH terminus and ligated into a transfer vector (pshuttle-CMV) at theBamHI and EcoRI sites. SOCS1 adenovirus was generated by homologous recombination in bacteria according to the manufacturer's instructions. C57BL/6 male mice (Jackson Laboratory) were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to water and food and handled in accordance with Joslin Diabetes Center Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. In some experiments, primary hepatocytes were isolated from mice and cultured for 24 h as described previously (14Shimomura I. Matsuda M. Hammer R.E. Bashmakov Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 77-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The cells were infected with control or SOCS1 adenovirus (multiplicity of infection of 40). Forty-eight hours after infection, cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as described previously (17Rui L. Fisher T.L. Thomas J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40362-40367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Mice were infected with control adenovirus or adenovirus containing wild type or mutant SOCS1 via tail vein injection (1011viral particles per animal). Blood glucose and Serum insulin levels were measured 10 or 28 days after infection, as described previously (3Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Liver or muscle extracts (2 mg of protein) were prepared for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as described previously (3Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). The interaction of IRS1 and IRS2 with SOCS proteins was examined in HEK293 cells prepared by transient transfection with HA-tagged SOCS1, the insulin receptor, and either IRS1 or IRS2. The effect of insulin to stimulate association of SOCS1 with IRS2 was revealed in anti-HA immunoprecipitates. Before insulin stimulation, IRS2 was detected in SOCS1 immunoprecipitates, and the association increased significantly after 10 min of insulin stimulation (Fig. 1 A). Similarly, IRS1 was coimmunoprecipitated with SOCS1, and insulin increased 2-fold the association between SOCS1 and IRS1 (Fig.1 A). IRS1 and IRS2 were also associated with SOCS2 or SOCS3 in similar coimmunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). The association between SOCS1 and IRS1 or IRS2 was also demonstrated in isolated mouse hepatocytes that were infected in tissue culture with an adenovirus containing HA-tagged SOCS1. Two days after infection, SOCS1 was detected in IRS1 or IRS2 immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting with anti-HA (Fig. 1 B). This association was detected even though the levels of IRS1 and IRS2 were significantly reduced in the hepatocytes expressing SOCS1 (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, SOCS1 also bound to hepatic IRS1 and IRS2 when it was expressed in mouse liver by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer (Fig. 1 C). Thus, SOCS proteins associate with IRS1 or IRS2 in various cell backgrounds and might promote degradation of the IRS proteins. The specificity of SOCS-induced degradation of IRS1 and IRS2 was investigated in HEK293 cells expressing the insulin receptor, IRS2, and either SOCS1, SOCS2, or SOCS3. Forty-eight hours after transfection, recombinant IRS2 was easily detected by immunoblotting in the absence of SOCS expression; however, coexpression of either SOCS1 or SOCS3 dramatically reduced IRS2 levels (Fig.2 A). By contrast, SOCS2 had no effect on the expression of IRS2, and actin levels were not affected by the expression of SOCS1, SOCS2, or SOCSS3 (Fig. 2 A). SOCS1 also caused a dose-dependent reduction of IRS1 without affecting the level of actin or the insulin receptor (Fig.2 B); similar results were observed upon SOCS3 expression (data not shown). Thus, SOCS1 and SOCS3 might promote the specific degradation of IRS1 and IRS2, whereas SOCS2 has no effect. The reduction of IRS protein levels by SOCS1 and SOCS3 was validated in other cell systems. SOCS1 or SOCS3 reduced endogenous IRS1 and IRS2 levels in human MCF7 breast cancer cells; activation of the PI 3-kinase during insulin stimulation was also reduced (data not shown). Proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNFα, IL-1β, or IFNγ promote the expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in various cells and tissues, including 3T3-L1 adipocytes (24Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7062-7068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Consequently, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with TNFα or IFNγ reduced the levels of IRS1 and IRS2 without reducing the level of the p85 regulatory subunit of the PI 3-kinase (p85) (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the loss of IRS1 and IRS2 protein in various cellular backgrounds correlates with the expression of SOCS1 or/and SOCS3. Male C57BL/6 mice were infected by tail vein injection with control or SOCS1 adenovirus. Ten days after infection, recombinant SOCS1 was easily detected in liver lysates (Fig.3 A). Consistent with the cell-based experiments described above, immunoblotting revealed that hepatic IRS1 and IRS2 proteins were dramatically reduced during adenoviral-mediated expression of SOCS1 (Fig. 3 A). By contrast, insulin receptor and p85 were not decreased (Fig.3 B). Moreover, 28 days after infection when SOCS1 was no longer detected in liver, IRS1 and IRS2 levels returned to normal (Fig.3 A). Since the liver is the major, if not the exclusive, site of gene expression upon injection of adenovirus vectors (44Herz J. Gerard R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2812-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), SOCS1 was not detected in muscle extracts and IRS1 and IRS2 levels were not reduced in muscle (Fig. 3 C). Sequence analysis reveals an elongin C binding motif in the SOCS box of SOCS1 and SOCS3 (45Lonergan K.M. Iliopoulos O. Ohh M. Kamura T. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Elongin C forms a stable complex with elongin B, which assembles an E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex (28Tyers M. Willems A.R. Science. 1999; 284 (603–604): 601Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, elongin BC ubiquitin-ligase might mediate ubiquitination and degradation of IRS1 and IRS2 by SOCS1 or SOCS3. The SOCS box (residues 167–212) was deleted (ΔS1), and ΔS1 was coexpressed with IRS2 in HEK293 cells. SOCS1 and ΔS1 were expressed to approximately equal levels (Fig. 4 A). As expected, IRS2 was degraded in cells expressing SOCS1, but not degraded in cells expressing ΔS1 (Fig. 4 A). To validate a specific role for elongin BC binding site, two conserved residues essential for elongin BC binding, Leu175 and Cys179, were replaced with Pro and Phe (SLC→PF) (27Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). SOCS1 or SLC→PF was expressed to equal levels in HEK293 cells together with the insulin receptor and either IRS1 or IRS2. SLC→PF weakly degraded IRS1 or IRS2 by comparison to SOCS1 (Fig. 4 B). Importantly, the mutations in the SOCS box did not prevent binding of SOCS1 to IRS1 or IRS2 (Fig.4 C). The inability of ΔS1 and SLC→PF to promote degradation of IRS1 and IRS2 might be caused by the absence of an elongin BC-based E3 ubiquitin-ligase. To test this possibility, IRS2 immunoprecipitates were prepared from HEK293 cell extracts expressing recombinant IRS2, Myc-tagged elongin C, and either SOCS1 or ΔS1. IRS2 immunoprecipitates from these transfected cells contained SOCS1 and ΔS1. However, coexpression of SOCS1, but not ΔS1, promoted the association of elongin C with IRS2 (Fig.4 D). These results support the hypothesis that SOCS1 has distinct binding sites for the ubiquitin-ligase complex and for IRS proteins and recruits elongin BC ubiquitin-ligase onto IRS1 or IRS2. Since the elongin BC binding motif in SOCS1 associates with an E3 ubiquitin-ligase, we investigated whether IRS1 was ubiquitinated in HEK293 cells transiently cotransfected with IRS1, Myc-tagged ubiquitin, and either SOCS1 or SLC→PF. A similar amount of immunopurified recombinant IRS1 proteins were immunoblotted with anti-Myc to measure the levels of IRS1 ubiquitination. SOCS1, but not SLC→PF, promoted ubiquitination of IRS1 (Fig. 4 E). SOCS1, but not SLC→PF, also promoted ubiquitination of IRS2 (data not shown). Consistent with the degradation of IRS proteins by the ubiquitin/proteasome system, proteasome inhibitors (lactacystin or MG132) block insulin-induced reduction of both IRS1 and IRS2 (17Rui L. Fisher T.L. Thomas J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40362-40367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Insulin promotes expression of SOCS3 (33Emanuelli B.

Previous reports suggest that the binding of SOCS proteins to the activated insulin receptor inhibits signal transduction (33Emanuelli B. Peraldi P. Filloux C. Chavey C. Freidinger K. Hilton D.J.

To investigate these possibilities, male C57BL/6 mice were infected with control or SOCS1 adenoviruses via a tail vein injection, and blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were monitored and insulin tolerances tests were performed to estimate insulin sensitivity. Ten days after viral infection, SOCS1 adenovirus-infected mice displayed fasting hyperglycemia, which was consistent with the loss of hepatic IRS1 and IRS2 (Fig. 5 A). By contrast during random feeding, blood glucose levels were indistinguishable in SOCS1 mice (140 ± 7 mg/dl) and control mice (150 ± 6 mg/dl), because of significant compensatory hyperinsulinemia (Fig.5 A). Consistent with these results, SOCS1 mice were relatively resistant to intraperitoneal insulin injections compared with control virus infection (Fig. 5 B). When SOCS1 expression subsided 28 days after infection, hepatic IRS1 and IRS2 returned to normal levels (Fig. 3 A), and the fasting blood glucose and insulin returned to the normal range (Fig.5 C). To verify that SOCS1-induced glucose intolerance was caused by ubiquitin-mediated degradation of hepatic IRS proteins, SOCS1, ΔS1, or SLC→PF were expressed in mouse liver by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery. As expected, only wild-type SOCS1 expression caused compensatory hyperinsulinemia, whereas insulin levels were normal in mice expressing ΔS1 or SLC→PF (Fig.5 D). Taken together, these results show that SOCS1 caused insulin resistance and glucose intolerance because of degradation of hepatic IRS1 and IRS2, rather than by disrupting the assembly of signaling complexes around the insulin receptor or the IRS proteins. Insulin resistance is not only the driving force for type 2 diabetes, but also associated with multiple other diseases, including hypertension, obesity, infertility, and neurodegeneration (5Burks D.J. de Mora J.F.

Proinflammatory cytokines are believed to play a critical role in insulin resistance during obesity and stress. In this study, we provided evidence showing that SOCS-promoted degradation of IRS proteins might mediate cytokine-induced insulin resistance. Previous reports suggest that SOCS1, SOCS3, and SOCS6 block assembly of signaling complexes that mediate insulin action by binding to tyrosine-phosphorylated sites in the insulin receptor or in the insulin receptor substrates, IRS1 or IRS2 (33Emanuelli B.

However, our work reveals that binding is not sufficient, as SOCS-mediated ubiquitination of IRS1 or IRS2 is a required step for inhibition of insulin action in various cell lines and mouse liver. This mechanism is consistent with the function of SOCS1 and SOCS3 as adapter molecules linking tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to an elongin BC-based E3 ubiquitin-ligase (27Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). SOCS1 mutants lacking binding site for elongin BC E3 bind IRS1 and IRS2, while failing to mediate their degradation or causing glucose intolerance in mice. SOCS1/3 are likely to promote insulin resistance by targeting IRS1 and IRS2 for degradation rather than by inhibiting insulin receptor function or by competing with other SH2 proteins for binding to the IRS proteins. During mechanical or thermal injury, or microbial infection, ordinary metabolic regulation by insulin is suspended to mobilize glucose and other nutrients for defense and repair. Proinflammatory cytokines produced under these conditions, including TNFα, interleukin-1, and IFNγ, inhibit the insulin-signaling cascade and promote glucose intolerance (19Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L., Li, Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar). TNFα, IFNγ, or IL-6 up-regulate SOCS proteins in various cell and tissues during the inflammatory response, including liver and pancreatic β-cells. SOCS3 is elevated for up to 10 days after thermal injury, which might contribute to the life-threatening catabolic state (22Ogle C.K. Kong F. Guo X. Wells D.A. Aosasa S. Noel G. Horseman N. Shock. 2000; 14: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). SOCS3 is elevated in insulin target tissues of obese mice, which correlates with reduced levels of IRS1 and IRS2 and insulin resistance (13Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D.J. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R.

The induction of SOCS proteins might be a general mechanism to attenuate insulin signaling when nutrients are required for repair or defense. Moreover, the high energy demands of pregnancy or adolescence might be ensured in part by SOCS-mediated insulin resistance induced by prolactin or growth hormone. Our experiments with mice following adenoviral-mediated expression of SOCS1 in liver confirm that hepatic SOCS1 degrades IRS1 and IRS2, resulting in glucose intolerance. Diabetes does not emerge during the experimental interval, because glucose tolerance is managed by compensatory hyperinsulinemia. If SOCS proteins are also up-regulated in pancreatic islets, compensatory insulin secretion might be compromised, because the IRS2 branch of the insulin/IGF signaling pathway is essential for β-cell function (11Kushner J.A., Ye, J. Schubert M. Burks D.J. Dow M.A. Flint C.L. Dutta S. Wright C.V. Montminy M.R. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1193-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, localized inflammation at pancreatic islets might promote SOCS-mediated degradation of IRS2 in β-cells, contributing to type 1 diabetes. In summary, we showed that SOCS1 and SOCS3 have distinct binding sites for IRS1 or IRS2 and for elongin BC ubiquitin-ligase. SOCS1/3 promote ubiquitination and degradation of IRS1 and IRS2 in both cultured cells and animal tissues, contributing to insulin resistance. The binding of elongin BC ubiquitin-ligase is required for SOCS1-promoted degradation of IRS proteins and glucose intolerance. Drugs that induce expression of IRS proteins or protect them from degradation might have value for the treatment of the insulin resistance syndromes and diabetes.

https://openalex.org/W2022770286,"The adsorption, diffusion, and clustering of water molecules on a Pd(111) surface were studied by scanning tunneling microscopy. At 40 kelvin, low-coverage water adsorbs in the form of isolated molecules, which diffuse by hopping to nearest neighbor sites. Upon collision, they form first dimers, then trimers, tetramers, and so on. The mobility of these species increased by several orders of magnitude when dimers, trimers, and tetramers formed, and decreased again when the cluster contained five or more molecules. Cyclic hexamers were found to be particularly stable. They grow with further exposure to form a commensurate hexagonal honeycomb structure relative to the Pd(111) substrate. These observations illustrate the change in relative strength between intermolecular hydrogen bonds and molecule-substrate bonds as a function of water cluster size, the key property that determines the wetting properties of materials."

Thus, studies on the regulated expression of endoglin are crucial to devising therapeutic strategies for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1. Endoglin is highly expressed in the neovasculature associated with hypoxia such as ischemic tissues and tumors, but the molecular mechanism of this up-regulation is unknown.

Surface protein, transcript, and promoter activity levels of endoglin were found to be up-regulated by hypoxia, indicating that the regulation takes place at the transcriptional level. A hypoxia-responsive element downstream of the main transcription start site of the endoglin gene was functionally characterized. Whereas hypoxia alone moderately stimulated endoglin transcription, addition of TGF-β under hypoxic conditions resulted in transcriptional cooperation between both signaling pathways, leading to marked stimulation of endoglin expression. Because basal endoglin transcription is sustained by Sp1, and TGF-β and hypoxia signaling pathways are mediated by Smad proteins and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), respectively, the involvement of these transcription factors was analyzed.

Moreover, the gene encoding endoglin is the target for a dominant autosomal hereditary disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (HHT1) (23McAllister K.A. Grogg K.M. Johnson D.W.

In this context, understanding the regulation of endoglin gene expression is crucial to approach therapies to correct the disease as well as to understand the role of endoglin in the vascular system. The endoglin gene maps to chromosome 9q34ter (30Fernandez-Ruiz E., St. Jacques S. Bellon T. Letarte M. Bernabéu C. Cytogenet.

The promoter region of the endoglin gene lacks TATA and CAAT boxes, but contains GC-rich tracts with consensus motifs for Sp1 binding (31Rı́us C. Smith J.D. Almendro N. Langa C. Botella L.M.

In fact, an Sp1 consensus at −37 is involved in the basal transcription of endoglin and in the stimulation of the endoglin promoter by TGF-β (32Botella L.M. Sánchez-Elsner T. Rius C. Corbı́ A.

Low cellular oxygen tension is found under physiological conditions such as high altitude and after physical exercise. In pathological situations, hypoxic conditions are found in ischemia, inflammation, and neoplasia (33Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia activates the transcription of genes that mediate adaptive responses of the organisms to counteract the low oxygen levels in such situations (34Ratcliffe P.J. O'Rourke J.F. Maxwell P.H.

Also, addition of TGF-β under hypoxic conditions results in the formation of a transcriptional multicomplex containing Smad3, Sp1, and HIF-1, leading to a cooperative effect of these factors on endoglin transcription.DISCUSSIONWe have shown here that human endoglin expression is up-regulated by hypoxia. This is fully compatible with the increased expression of endoglin detected in pathological tissues associated with hypoxic conditions (6Conley B.A. Smith J.D. Guerrero-Esteo M. Bernabéu C.

We have also shown that hypoxia and TGF-β cooperate to induce expression of human endoglin at the transcriptional level. This is strikingly similar to the cooperative effect shown by these two stimuli on the expression of human VEGF (17Sánchez-Elsner T. Botella L.M. Velasco B. Corbı́ A. Attisano L. Bernabéu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38527-38535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Both endoglin and VEGF play a crucial role in the angiogenic process. Endoglin gene ablation in mice leads to defects in cardiovascular development and vascular remodeling (20Li D.Y. Sorensen L.K. Brooke B.S. Urness L.D. Davis E.C. Taylor D.G. Boak B.B. Wendel D.P.

Diamond A.G. Dev. Biol. 2000; 217: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and mutations of the human endoglin gene are responsible for the vascular dysplasia known as HHT1 (24Marchuk D.A.

Letarte M. Thorax. 1999; 54: 714-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). On the other hand, VEGF promotes the formation of blood vessels by inducing proliferation, migration, elongation, network formation, and branching of endothelial cells (63Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3426) Google Scholar, 64Ferrara N. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 65Cross M.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 201-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Endoglin and VEGF involvement in the angiogenic process and their regulated expression by hypoxia and TGF-β agree with the fact that hypoxia and TGF-β are general regulators of angiogenesis (63Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3426) Google Scholar, 66Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7350) Google Scholar, 67Pepper M.S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). In a physiological context, the effect of hypoxia is accompanied in many cases by an increase in TGF-β levels, especially after processes of sustained hypoxia, which result in up-regulation of TGF-β1 (68Falanga V. Qian S.W. Danielpour D. Katz M.H. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 634-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby connecting both stimuli in an autocrine loop. Interestingly, the function and expression of endoglin are closely related to the TGF-β system. Endoglin has been characterized as a functional component of the TGF-β receptor system (8Cheifetz S.

Both hypoxia and TGF-β are operative factors in several physiological processes such as ischemia, pulmonary hypertension, cancer, and trophoblast differentiation (33Semenza G.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1983-1991PubMed Google Scholar, 69Massagué J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2053) Google Scholar, 70Blobe G.C.

The cooperative effect between both stimuli on endothelial cells could be a highly adaptive response to optimize angiogenesis under special situations. In this regard, endothelial cells are the first barrier of an organism subjected to environmental changes, ischemia, or tissue injury.Although endoglin expression was found to be up-regulated by hypoxia, this effect was less than that observed in the presence of TGF-β. TGF-β stimulation reached up to 3–3.5-fold under optimal conditions as seen in this and previous work (31Rı́us C. Smith J.D. Almendro N. Langa C. Botella L.M. Marchuck D.A. Vary C.H. Bernabéu C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34486-34494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas hypoxia alone increased the activity of the endoglin promoter by ∼1.5–2-fold. The combined effect of hypoxia and TGF-β yielded a total increase in endoglin promoter activity of up to 7–8-fold, the same type of synergy observed for the VEGF promoter (17Sánchez-Elsner T.

Overall, TGF-β stimulation prevailed over hypoxia in the endoglin promoter (Figs. 1 and 2), whereas the reverse applies in the case of the VEGF promoter (17Sánchez-Elsner T. Botella L.M. Velasco B. Corbı́ A. Attisano L. Bernabéu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38527-38535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). This differential behavior is likely because of the specific transcriptional context of each gene. In this sense, the hypoxic effect on the endoglin gene is exerted through HIF-1α, whose binding site has been localized at +338/+344 of the promoter, downstream of the main transcription start and just before the ATG translation initiation codon at +351/+353. This localization is different from that of the HRE motifs reported in the VEGF (37Forsythe J.H. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell.

It is worth mentioning that in the endoglin, VEGF, and erythropoietin gene promoters, the functional HRE consist of the same 5′-(G/C/T)ACGTG-3′ consensus sequence (Fig. 4) (37Forsythe J.H. Jiang B.H.

https://openalex.org/W2000440562,"FKHR is a member of the FOXO subfamily of Forkhead transcription factors, which are important targets for insulin and growth factor signaling. FKHR contains three predicted protein kinase B phosphorylation sites (Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319) that are conserved in other FOXO proteins. We have reported that phosphorylation of Ser-256 is critical for the ability of insulin and insulin-like growth factors to suppress transactivation by FKHR (Guo, S., Rena, G., Cichy, S., He, X., Cohen, P., and Unterman, T. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 17184–17192) and for its exclusion from the nucleus (Rena, G., Prescott, A. R., Guo, S., Cohen, P., and Unterman, T. G. (2001) Biochem. J.354, 605–612). Ser-256 is located in a basic region of the FKHR DNA binding domain where phosphorylation may have direct effects on DNA binding and/or nuclear targeting. Phosphorylation of Ser-256 may also be required for the phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-319. Here, we provide the first direct evidence that basic residues in the FKHR DNA binding domain are critical for DNA binding and that Ser-256 phosphorylation alters binding activity. Ser-256 phosphorylation also is critical for regulating nuclear/cytoplasmic trafficking; however, this effect requires Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation. Transient transfection studies with reporter gene constructs in 293 cells reveal that the phosphorylation of Ser-256 can inhibit the function of FKHR independent of Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation. Studies with GFP1 fusion proteins indicate that Ser-256 phosphorylation is critical for nuclear exclusion of FKHR. However, this effect is disrupted when Thr-24 and Ser-319 are replaced by alanine, indicating that nuclear exclusion of FKHR also requires Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation. Gel shift and fluorescence anisotropy studies reveal that basic residues at the C-terminal end of the FKHR DBD are important for DNA binding, and the introduction of a negative charge at the site of Ser-256 limits binding activity. Binding is rapid and reversible, providing an opportunity for the phosphorylation of Ser-256 and subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-319 and nuclear exclusion of FKHR.

Recent studies have revealed that FOXO Forkhead transcription factors are important targets for mediating effects of insulin and growth factors on gene expression downstream from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (PKB; also known as Akt) (1–13). Early findings in this laboratory revealed that Forkhead transcription factors interact with insulin response sequences (IRSs) in the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) genes (14Goswami R. Lacson R. Yang E. Sam R. Unterman T. Endocrinol. 1994; 134: 2531-2539Google Scholar, 15Unterman T.G. Fareeduddin A. Harris M.A. Goswami R.G. Porcella A. Costa R.H. Lacson R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in Caenorhabditis elegans provided genetic evidence that DAF-16, a member of the FOXO subfamily of Forkhead transcription factors, is a major target for signaling by the insulin/IGF receptor-PI3K-PKB pathway in the nematode (17Ogg S.

Thus, the ability to suppress transactivation by FOXO Forkhead proteins is important for insulin to regulate hepatic production of IGFBP-1 and glucose and for effects of growth factors on cell proliferation and survival. Several critical features distinguish FOXO proteins from other Forkhead family members and make them uniquely suited as mediators of insulin and growth factor action. X-ray crystallographic studies with the DBD of HNF-3γ indicated that the DNA binding motif of Forkhead proteins, named the Forkhead box, or FOX box, contains three α-helices, a wing-like structure that spreads out over target sites, and a C-terminal basic region (30Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, helix 1 and 2 present helix 3 of the FOX box to the major groove of DNA target sites, where helix 3 interacts directly with the target sequence and mediates sequence-specific binding (30Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Google Scholar). FOXO proteins are the most divergent of all Forkhead family members in the region of helix 3, and site-selected PCR amplification studies indicate that FOXO proteins interact preferentially with a consensus target site (GTAAAACAA) that diverges from consensus sequences derived for other Forkhead proteins (31Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Google Scholar). This difference in binding specificity provides a basis for directing FOXO proteins preferentially to target sites in insulin- and growth factor-regulated genes. Crystallographic studies also suggest that the C-terminal basic region of the FOX box may interact as a random coil with phosphate residues in the minor groove of DNA target sites (see Fig. 1) and stabilize DNA binding through interactions that are not sequence-specific (30Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Google Scholar). However, the role of the basic region in determining binding activity has not been tested directly. Because the Forkhead DBD also contains a nuclear targeting function (32Qian X. Costa R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1184-1191Google Scholar), and nuclear localization signals are often enriched in basic residues (33Adam S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 402-406Google Scholar), it has been suggested that this basic region may also function to target FOXO protein to the nucleus, and recent studies in this and other laboratories have supported this possibility (2Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Google Scholar, 34Brownawell A.M. Kops G.J. Macara I.G. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3534-3546Google Scholar). Based on this model, it is reasonable to speculate that changes in the charge of this basic region might impair nuclear targeting and/or DNA binding of FOXO proteins. Another critical feature that distinguishes FOXO proteins from other Forkhead family members is the presence of three highly conserved phosphorylation sites corresponding to Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 in human FKHR (3Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Google Scholar). The presence of these sites was predicted based on a consensus motif for PKB phosphorylation (Arg-X-Arg-X-X-(Ser/Thr)) (35Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Google Scholar) and confirmed by 32P loading studies and studies with phosphospecific antibodies (3Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Google Scholar, 5Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar, 7Nakae J.

Although each of these sites can be phosphorylated by PKB in vitro and in cells (3Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Google Scholar), recent studies indicate that other PI3K-dependent kinases, such as the serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible protein kinase, may also contribute to the phosphorylation of Thr-24 and/or Ser-319 (6Brunet A. Park J. Tran H. Hu L.S. Hemmings B.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 952-965Google Scholar, 11Nakae J. Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Accili D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11768-11776Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these sites results in the exclusion of FOXO proteins from the nucleus (2Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Google Scholar, 5Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E.

A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Google Scholar) and is critical for the ability of insulin and growth factors to suppress the function of FOXO proteins (1Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Google Scholar, 5Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Google Scholar, 8Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Google Scholar, 9Kops G.J. de Ruiter N.D. Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Google Scholar). We have reported that phosphorylation of Ser-256 is essential for the ability of insulin and IGFs to suppress transactivation by FKHR and that introducing a negative charge at this site by replacing Ser-256 with an aspartate residue is sufficient to impair IRS-dependent transactivation by FKHR (1Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Google Scholar). Studies by Rena et al. (2Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Google Scholar, 3Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Google Scholar) and Nakae et al. (37Nakae J. Barr V. Accili D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 989-996Google Scholar) indicate that phosphorylation of Ser-256 may be required for the efficient phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-319, suggesting that Ser-256 may function as a gatekeeper in a process of hierarchical phosphorylation. In this case, phosphorylation of Ser-256 may be critical for regulating the function of FKHR largely because of effects that are mediated through the subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-319. At the same time, Ser-256 is located at the C-terminal end of the FOX box (Fig. 1), suggesting that phosphorylation at this site may be sufficient to alter nuclear targeting of FKHR and/or DNA binding directly, independent of Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation. To better understand the specific mechanism(s) mediating the effect(s) of phosphorylation on the function of FOXO proteins, we asked whether the phosphorylation of Ser-256 has an effect on transactivation by FKHR that is independent of Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation and whether this effect is mediated through effects on nuclear targeting and/or DNA binding. Reporter gene studies in 293 cells reveal that Ser-256 phosphorylation can limit transactivation by FKHR through a mechanism that is independent of Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation, whereas cellular trafficking studies indicate that phosphorylation of Thr-24 and/or Ser-319 (but not Ser-256) is critical for nuclear exclusion of FKHR. Gel shift and fluorescence anisotropy studies demonstrate that the introduction of negative charge at the site of Ser-256 is sufficient to limit DNA binding activity. To our knowledge, these studies provide the first direct evidence for a critical role of basic residues in the C-terminal region of the FOX box in DNA binding. Together, they demonstrate that the introduction of a negative charge in this region can limit transactivation by FOXO proteins through multiple mechanisms, including a direct effect on DNA binding. Oligonucleotides containing an array of three copies of an insulin response sequence (IRSA) in the IGFBP-1 promoter were cloned immediately 5′ to the 81-bp thymidine kinase promoter and luciferase cDNA in TK·IRS3, as reported previously (16Cichy S.B. Uddin S. Danilkovich A. Guo S. Klippel A. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6482-6487Google Scholar). The FKHR cDNA containing 224 bp of 5′- and 133 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence was subcloned into theXbaI-AccI site in pAlter.MAX (Promega) downstream from the cytomegalovirus promoter as reported (1Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA templates were prepared with helper phage R408 for site-directed mutagenesis using appropriate synthetic oligonucleotides. Mutations were confirmed by dideoxy sequencing in the University of Illinois at Chicago Sequence Center. For studies of cellular trafficking, mutated forms of the FKHR cDNA were cloned in-frame with the GFP cDNA in the BglII-SalI site in pEGFP-N1 ( Clontech). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, and 1 × 106 cells were plated per 60-mm dish for transfection with calcium phosphate precipitates. Cells were transfected with 10 μg plasmid DNA/dish, including 3 μg of TK·IRS3, 2 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector, with or without 3 μg of FKHR expression vectors, and appropriate amounts of empty vector. Transfected cells were re-fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 1g/liter fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin with or without 100 ng/ml recombinant human IGF-I 18 h prior to the preparation of lysates and analysis of luciferase activity. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. For cellular trafficking studies, 293 cells were plated on polysine-coated cover slips and transfected with expression vectors using LipofectAMINE-2000 (Invitrogen) and then stabilized for 18 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prior to treatment with/without 20 nm leptomycin B (Sigma) or LY294002 (Calbiochem). Cells were fixed with 4% parafomaldehyde, and nuclei were stained with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-2HCl (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). Fusion proteins were visualized by laser confocal microscopy with a Zeiss confocal laser scanning 510 microscope in the University of Illinois at Chicago Research Resource Center. Based on initial studies showing that bacterially expressed recombinant proteins containing full-length FKHR are unstable, we prepared proteins containing the DNA binding domain for studies of binding activity. For bacterial expression of recombinant proteins, NdeI and XhoI sites were introduced into the FKHR cDNA by mutagenesis in pAlter.Max, and the fragment of the FKHR cDNA coding for amino acids 160–266 was cloned in-frame to the C-terminal Leu-Gln-His6 tag in pET21b (Novagen). The wild-type FKHR DBD and mutant proteins were expressed in BL21-DE3 cells (Stratagene) in LB medium by induction of T7 polymerase at mid-logarithmic growth by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were lysed with 8 m urea, and His-tagged proteins were recovered on nickel-agarose beads. Proteins were eluted and denatured in 8m urea, pH 4.5, and renatured by two-step dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.5. Proteins were re-purified by nickel-agarose chromatography, eluted with 8 m urea, pH 4.5, and renatured by dialysis prior to storage in 10% glycerol at −70 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Recombinant proteins were >95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stain. CD spectra of the wild-type FKHR DBD and mutant proteins were measured with a Jasco 710 circular dichroism spectrometer that was equipped with a ThermoNESLAB circulating water bath that was thermostated to 25 ± 0.1 °C. Protein samples were prepared at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, pH. 7.0, and were placed into a circular quartz cuvette with a pathlength of 0.10 cm. Spectra were recorded over a range of 195–250 + 0.5 nm at 0.5-nm increments with a 1.0-nm bandwidth. The integration time was 1 s, and three measurements were made and averaged at each wavelength at a sensitivity of 50 millidegrees. The secondary structure content was estimated by the method of Deléage et al. (38Deléage G. Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Comput. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 259-267Google Scholar) using the software program DICROPROT (38Deléage G. Combet C. Blanchet C. Geourjon C. Comput. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 259-267Google Scholar). CD melting curves from 20 to 70 °C were measured at 225 nm at 1-degree increments using the same experimental setup. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing a naturally occurring FKHR binding site (GCAAAACAA) from the IGFBP-1 promoter (CTAGATGCAAAACA-ACTGTGACTAGTAGAACACGG; ΔIRS.1) or a consensus binding site for FOXO Forkhead proteins (CTAGATGgtAAACAACTGTGACTAGTAGAACACGG; ΔFOXO) were end-labeled with 32P. Probes were incubated with 0 to 30 ng of recombinant protein with or without unlabeled competitors for 20 min at 4 °C in 20 μl of binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 50 ng/ml poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC)) prior to 10% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 4 °C for 90 min. Gels were dried prior to autoradiography or quantification by phosphorimaging. Fluorescence anisotropy binding studies were performed on an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer in T-format with film polarizers. The 5′-end of the sense strand of the ΔIRS.1 probe was tagged with fluorescein during synthesis, and the double-stranded probe was purified on a non-denaturing gel to reduce background. The anisotropy of 10 nm fluorescent-tagged probe in 1.2 ml of binding buffer (see above) in an acrylic cuvette (Sarstedt) was measured at 25 °C before and after adding 5–1000 nm recombinant protein. Excitation was at 495 nm, and fluorescent emission was detected through a filter that transmitted light at wavelengths >500 nm(50% transmission at 515 nm). Fluorescence anisotropy (A) was calculated from the ratio of vertically polarized emission (V) to horizontally polarized emission (H) when the sample was excited with vertically polarized light using the equation, A = (V/GH − 1)/(V/GH + 2), whereG is the ratio, V/H, measured with horizontally polarized excitation. The latter ratio corrects for the bias between the two emission channels. Emission intensities were corrected for a buffer blank. The average of three separate readings (10-s integration) taken at each protein concentration was calculated. Binding data were computer fit by nonlinear regression to the quadratic equilibrium binding equation assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry for the protein-DNA probe interaction to obtain the binding dissociation constant (K d) (39Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-559Google Scholar). To assess the role of Ser-256 in modulating the function of FKHR, we first performed reporter gene studies in human embryonic kidney 293 cells from ATCC using a luciferase reporter gene construct containing an array of three insulin response sequences upstream of the 81-bp thymidine kinase promoter (TK·IRS3). Basal promoter activity of this reporter gene construct is negligible, so that luciferase activity reflects transactivation by FKHR expressed in these cells (2Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, IGF-I treatment inhibits transactivation by wild-type FKHR by ∼50%. Replacing Ser-256 with alanine (S256A) completely disrupts this effect of IGF-I (Fig.2 A), indicating that phosphorylation of Ser-256 is critical for the ability of IGF-I to suppress transactivation by FKHR, as reported previously (2Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate that Ser-256 phosphorylation precedes (3Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Google Scholar) and may be required for the phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-319 in FKHR (2Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Google Scholar, 37Nakae J. Barr V. Accili D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 989-996Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, replacing Thr-24 and Ser-319 with alanine (T24A/S319A) partially reduces, but does not completely disrupt, the ability of IGF-I to suppress transactivation by FKHR. This result indicates that Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation contributes to, but does not fully account for, the ability of IGF-I to inhibit transactivation by FKHR. Replacing Ser-256 with alanine, together with Thr-24 and Ser-319 (T24A/S256A/S319A), disrupts the residual effect of IGF-I, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser-256 can contribute to the effect of IGF-I on transactivation by FKHR through a mechanism that does not require Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation. Studies with phosphospecific antibodies have shown that Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 are phosphorylated under serum-free conditions in 293 cells reflecting basal kinase activity, and IGF-I treatment enhances their phosphorylation (2Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, replacing Thr-24 and Ser-319 with alanine (T24A/S319A) enhances transactivation by FKHR ∼3-fold compared with WT FKHR in 293 cells that have been stabilized in serum-free medium, indicating that phosphorylation of Thr-24 and Ser-319 limits transactivation by FKHR under basal conditions. Replacing Ser-256 with alanine, together with Thr-24 and Ser-319 (T24A/S256A/S319A), modestly increases transactivation compared with the T24A/S319A mutant, suggesting that phosphorylation at this site may limit basal transactivation by FKHR through a mechanism that is independent of Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation. Conversely, replacing Ser- 256 with an aspartate residue (T24A/S256D/S319A) reduces transactivation by two-thirds compared with the T24A/S319A mutant. This result provides direct evidence for the concept that the introduction of a negative charge at this site is sufficient to reduce transactivation by FKHR in the absence of Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation. We next examined specific mechanisms that may mediate effects of Ser-256 phosphorylation on transactivation by FKHR. Studies in several laboratories have shown that phosphorylation of FKHR results in its exclusion from the nucleus (1Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Google Scholar, 12Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Google Scholar, 40Brunet A. Kanai F. Stehn J. Xu J. Sarbassova D. Frangioni J.V. Dalal S.N. DeCaprio J.A. Greenberg M.E. Yaffe M.B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 817-828Google Scholar). As shown in the top panel of Fig. 3 B, GFP-tagged wild-type FKHR is located largely in the extranuclear compartment of ATCC 293 cells stabilized for 18 h in serum-free medium. Treatment with leptomycin B, which inhibits the function of Crm-1 nuclear export proteins, results in nuclear targeting of FKHR-GFP. These results indicate that FKHR-GFP is actively shuttling in and out of the nucleus and that nuclear targeting of FKHR-GFP is apparent once nuclear export is inhibited. Treatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor that prevents the phosphorylation of Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 (2Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Google Scholar, 3Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C. Unterman T.G. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17179-17183Google Scholar), also results in nuclear targeting of FKHR-GFP, as does replacing Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 with alanine (bottom panel, Fig. 3 B). These studies indicate that PI3K-dependent phosphorylation at these sites is critical for nuclear exclusion of FKHR, consistent with previous studies (1Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Google Scholar, 12Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 817-828Google Scholar). To examine the role of Ser-256 in regulating the distribution of FKHR in 293 cells, we performed studies with additional GFP fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 3 C, replacing Ser-256 with alanine (S256A) results in nuclear targeting of FKHR-GFP, whereas replacing Ser-256 with aspartate (S256D) results in nuclear exclusion. This indicates that phosphorylation and the introduction of a negative charge at this site is critical for nuclear exclusion of FKHR. Because replacing Ser-256 with alanine prevents Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation (2Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Google Scholar), and replacing Ser-256 with aspartate can partially promote Thr-24/Ser-319 phosphorylation (2Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Bioc"
https://openalex.org/W2054427773,"Stress of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is associated with many neurodegenerative conditions, can lead to the elimination of affected cells by apoptosis through only partially understood mechanisms. Thapsigargin, which causes ER stress by inhibiting the ER Ca2+-ATPase, was found to not only activate the apoptosis effector caspase-3 but also to cause a large and prolonged increase in the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). Activation of GSK3β was obligatory for thapsigargin-induced activation of caspase-3, because inhibition of GSK3β by expression of dominant-negative GSK3β or by the GSK3β inhibitor lithium blocked caspase-3 activation. Thapsigargin treatment activated GSK3β by inducing dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser-9 of GSK3β, a phosphorylation that normally maintains GSK3β inactivated. Caspase-3 activation induced by thapsigargin was blocked by increasing the phosphorylation of Ser-9-GSK3β with insulin-like growth factor-1 or with the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A, but the calcineurin inhibitors FK506 and cyclosporin A were ineffective. Insulin-like growth factor-1, okadaic acid, calyculin A, and lithium also protected cells from two other inducers of ER stress, tunicamycin and brefeldin A. Thus, ER stress activates GSK3β through dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser-9, a prerequisite for caspase-3 activation, and this process is amenable to pharmacological intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2024426942,"Gibberellins (GAs) are diterpene plant hormones essential for many developmental processes. Although the GA biosynthesis pathway has been well studied, our knowledge on its early stage is still limited. There are two possible routes for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids leading to GAs, the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids. To distinguish these possibilities, metabolites from each isoprenoid pathway were selectively labeled with13C in Arabidopsis seedlings. Efficient 13C-labeling was achieved by blocking the endogenous pathway chemically or genetically during the feed of a13C-labeled precursor specific to the MVA or MEP pathways. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that both MVA and MEP pathways can contribute to the biosyntheses of GAs and campesterol, a cytosolic sterol, in Arabidopsisseedlings. While GAs are predominantly synthesized through the MEP pathway, the MVA pathway plays a major role in the biosynthesis of campesterol. Consistent with some crossover between the two pathways, phenotypic defects caused by the block of the MVA and MEP pathways were partially rescued by exogenous application of the MEP and MVA precursors, respectively. We also provide evidence to suggest that the MVA pathway still contributes to GA biosynthesis when this pathway is limiting.

In plants, the MVA pathway plays an essential role in the biosynthesis of sterols and sesquiterpenoids in the cytoplasm (4Gray J.C. Adv. Bot. Res. 1987; 14: 25-91Google Scholar). On the other hand, the MEP pathway is generally responsible for the formation of carotenoids, mono- and di-terpenoids, plastoquinones, and the prenyl group of chlorophylls in plastids (3Lichtenthaler H.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 47-65Google Scholar). The occurrence of two separate isoprenoid biosynthesis pathways in plants was already implicated in the 1960s from feeding experiments with 14CO2 and [14C]MVA, which showed that these substrates labeled distinct groups of terpenoids (5Treharne K.J. Mercer E.I. Goodwin T.W. Biochem. J. 1966; 99: 239-245Google Scholar). The MEP pathway was first described for eubacteria (6Rohmer M. Seemann M. Horbach S. Bringer-Meyer S. Sahm H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2564-2566Google Scholar), and enzymes catalyzing the MEP pathway have been identified mainly in Escherichia coli (7Eisenreich W. Schwarz M. Cartayrade A. Arigoni D. Zenk M.H. Bacher A. Chem. Biol. (Lond.). 1998; 5: 221-233Google Scholar, 8Kuzuyama T. Biocsci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 1619-1627Google Scholar). Although the precise reactions in the late steps of MEP pathway have still to be determined, the overall pathway in E. coli has recently been proposed (9Rohdich F. Hecht S. Gärtner K. Adam P. Krieger C. Amslinger S. Arigoni D. Bacher A. Eisenreich W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1158-1163Google Scholar). Because orthologs of each of the bacterial genes of the MEP pathway are present in Arabidopsis thaliana (8Kuzuyama T. Biocsci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 1619-1627Google Scholar, 10Sponsel V.M. J. Plant Growth Regul. 2001; 20: 332-345Google Scholar), the same set of enzymes are likely to be involved in the MEP pathway in plants. Gibberellins (GAs) are a class of plant hormones essential for many aspects of plant growth and development, such as seed germination, stem elongation, and flower development (11Crozier A. Kamiya Y. Bishop G. Yokota T. Buchanan B.B. Gruissem W. Jones R.L. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants. American Society of Plant Physiology, Rockville, Maryland2000: 851-865Google Scholar, 12Yamaguchi S. Kamiya Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 251-257Google Scholar). The GA biosynthesis pathway in higher plants has been studied in detail in cell-free systems from immature seeds of Cucurbita maxima,Pisum sativum, and Phaseolus vulgaris (13Graebe J.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1987; 38: 419-465Google Scholar). Because 14C-labeled MVA was efficiently incorporated intoent-kaurene (a GA precursor) in these cell-free systems, it has long been assumed that GAs are derived from MVA in plants. The GA biosynthesis pathway has also been studied extensively in a GA-producing fungus Gibberella fujikuroi (14Hedden P. Phillips A.L. Rojas M.C. Carrera E. Tudzynski B. J. Plant Growth Regul. 2001; 20: 319-331Google Scholar). The incorporation of labeled MVA into GAs in cultured mycelia of this fungus also supported the premise that GAs are formed from MVA in this organism (15Hanson J.R. White A.F. J. Chem. Soc. 1969; : 981-984Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence from recent work have indicated thatent-kaurene is synthesized in the plastids of plants (16Railton I.D. Fellows B. West C.A. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 1261-1267Google Scholar, 17Sun T.P. Kamiya Y. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1509-1518Google Scholar, 18Aach H. Böse G. Graebe J.E. Planta. 1995; 197: 333-342Google Scholar, 19Yamaguchi S. Saito T. Abe H. Yamane H. Murofushi N. Kamiya Y. Plant J. 1996; 10: 203-213Google Scholar). Therefore, the MEP pathway in plastids may play a role in providing IPP and DMAPP for ent-kaurene biosynthesis (Fig.1). There is some indirect evidence to support this hypothesis. Antisense suppression of genes encoding enzymes in theArabidopsis MEP pathway resulted in elevated expression of a GA-down-regulated gene, GA4 (20Estévez J.M. Cantero A. Reindl A. Reichler S. León P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22901-22909Google Scholar), and reduced production ofent-kaurene (21Okada K. Kawaide H. Kuzuyama T. Seto H. Curtis I.S. Kamiya Y. Planta. 2002; 215: 339-344Google Scholar). Recently, the biosynthetic origin of stevioside, of which the aglycone is a derivative ofent-kaurenoic acid, has been studied in Stevia rebaudiana leaves (22Totté N. Charon L. Rohmer M. Compernolle F. Baboeuf I. Geuns J.M.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 6407-6410Google Scholar), where this diterpene glycoside accumulates to more than 10% of the leaf dry weight as a secondary metabolite. This high abundance allowed the 13C-labeling pattern from [1-13C]glucose in steviol to be determined by NMR and indicated that steviosides are synthesized through the MEP pathway. However, this method is not feasible for GAs due to their low abundance in plant tissues. Thus, to determine whether GAs are synthesized through the MEP pathway in general, a more sensitive system for detecting the labeled products is required. To this end, we used an Arabidopsis albino mutantcla1−1, which is defective in 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase in the MEP pathway (23Estévez J.M. Cantero A. Romero C. Kawaide H. Jiménez L.F. Kuzuyama T. Seto H. Kamiya Y. León P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 95-104Google Scholar). The cla1−1 phenotype can be rescued almost completely by treatment with exogenous 1-deoxy-d-xylulose (DX), which is converted to a MEP pathway intermediate 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate in plants. This system allowed us to label the products from the MEP pathway efficientlyin vivo using [2-13C]DX. To evaluate the role of the cytosolic MVA pathway in GA biosynthesis in the same system,13C-labeled mevalonolactone (MVL) was fed to plants that were treated with mevastatin, an inhibitor of the MVA pathway. Our gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis demonstrated that GAs are predominantly synthesized from the MEP pathway inArabidopsis seedlings. However, our results also indicated a minor contribution of the MVA pathway to GA biosynthesis. Cooperation of both isoprenoid pathways was also evident for the biosynthesis of the sterol campesterol (a precursor for brassinosteroids), which is formed in the cytosol. A. thaliana ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) was used in this study. Plants were grown at 21 °C using a 16-h light/8-h dark photoperiod with cool-white illumination. Wild-type (WS-2) and the cla1−1mutant (24Mandel M.A. Feldmann K.A. Herrera-Estrella L. Rocha-Sosa M. León P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 649-658Google Scholar) were germinated and grown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar media (pH 5.7) supplemented with thiamin hydrochloride (3 μg·ml−1), nicotinic acid (5 μg·ml−1), pyridoxin hydrochloride (0.5 μg·ml−1), and 1 or 3% (w/v) sucrose. Liquid culture was carried out in 15 ml of MS media in 100-ml flasks on a shaker (100 rpm). DX and [2-13C]DX (95% labeled) were synthesized using pyruvate or [2-13C]pyruvate (99% labeled, Aldrich) as previously reported (25Kuzuyama T. Takahashi S. Watanabe H. Seto H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1998; 39: 4509-4512Google Scholar). To determine the13C-labeling ratio of [2-13C]DX, DX and [2-13C]DX (ca. 100 ng) were converted to trimethylsilyl derivatives by heating at 70 °C with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide + trimethylchlorosilane + trimethylsilylimidazole (3:2:3, 50 μl, Supelco) and pyridine (50 μl) for 20 min and then analyzed by GC-MS as previously reported (26Lange B.M. Wildung M.R. McCaskill D. Croteau R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2100-2104Google Scholar). dl-MVL and [2-13C]MVL (99% labeled) were purchased from Aldrich, and mevastatin was from Sigma.ent-[1,7,12,18-13C4]Kaurene was produced from [2-13C]MVA by a cell-free system prepared from C. maxima endosperm as previously reported (27Saito T. Abe H. Yamane H. Sakurai A. Murofushi N. Takio K. Takahashi N. Kamiya Y. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1239-1245Google Scholar, 28Graebe J.E. Bowen D.H. MacMillan J. Planta. 1972; 102: 261-271Google Scholar). The albino cla1−1 homozygotes were selected from the progeny ofCLA1/cla1−1 plants after incubation on MS agar media for 9 days. The cla1−1 seedlings were then transferred to MS liquid media. [2-13C]DX was dissolved in H2O, filter-sterilized, and added aseptically to the liquid culture. Twelve days after the transfer to liquid media, uniconazole (EtOH solution, final concentration 1 μm) was added, and then the plants were grown for an additional 3 days before analyzing ent-kaurene. GA12 and campesterol were analyzed without uniconazole treatment. Wild-type seedlings were grown for 5 days on MS agar media before transferring to MS liquid media. Immediately after the transfer, mevastatin (MeOH solution, final concentration 10 μm) and [2-13C]MVL (filter-sterilized H2O solution) were added aseptically to the liquid media, and the plants were grown for 9 days. ent-Kaurene, GA12, and campesterol were analyzed as described above. For ent-kaurene analyses, seedlings (∼3 g) were pulverized with a mortar and pestle chilled by liquid N2. Powdered tissues were extracted with 80% MeOH (25 ml) overnight. The 80% MeOH extract was then partitioned againstn-hexane (15 ml) three times, and the combinedn-hexane fraction was evaporated to 1 ml. Then-hexane fraction was subjected to SiO2 gel column chromatography (column size, 5 × 2 cm) and eluted with 15 ml of n-hexane. The eluate was carefully evaporated to 20 μl under gentle N2 flow and analyzed by GC-MS. GC-MS analysis was performed on a GC-mate II mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a Agilent 6890 series GC system with a 30-m × 0.25-mm capillary column DB-5 MS (0.25-μm film thickness, J & W Scientific). GA12 and campesterol were extracted from 22∼27-g and 0.4-g seedlings and derivatized to methyl ester and TMS ether, respectively, and analyzed as reported previously (29Silverstone A.L. Jung H.S. Dill A. Kawaide H. Kamiya Y. Sun T.P. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1555-1566Google Scholar, 30Fujioka S. Li J. Choi Y.-H. Seto H. Takatsuto S. Noguchi T. Watanabe T. Kuriyama H. Yokota T. Chory J. Sakurai A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1951-1962Google Scholar). ent-Kaurene and GA12 were identified by Kovats retention indices (31Gaskin P. MacMillan J. Firn R.D. Pryce R.J. Phytochemistry. 1971; 10: 1155-1157Google Scholar), and full mass spectra obtained by GC-MS (29Silverstone A.L. Jung H.S. Dill A. Kawaide H. Kamiya Y. Sun T.P. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1555-1566Google Scholar, 32Gaskin P. MacMillan J. GC-MS of the Gibberellins and Related Compounds: Methodology and a Library of Spectra. University of Bristol, Oxford1991: 69-70Google Scholar). TheArabidopsis cla1−1 mutant is defective in 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase in the MEP pathway and displays a seedling-lethal albino phenotype (23Estévez J.M. Cantero A. Romero C. Kawaide H. Jiménez L.F. Kuzuyama T. Seto H. Kamiya Y. León P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 95-104Google Scholar, 24Mandel M.A. Feldmann K.A. Herrera-Estrella L. Rocha-Sosa M. León P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 649-658Google Scholar). Previous studies show that the cla1−1 phenotype is in part restored when grown on agar media containing DX (23Estévez J.M. Cantero A. Romero C. Kawaide H. Jiménez L.F. Kuzuyama T. Seto H. Kamiya Y. León P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 95-104Google Scholar). We found that thecla1−1 phenotype can be better rescued in liquid culture than on agar media in the presence of DX, possibly because of better uptake of the chemical by seedlings. Fig.2 A shows that, in the presence of 0.8–1.0 mm DX, the phenotype of the cla1−1plants was restored to that of the wild type. To label isoprenoids that are produced via the MEP pathway in vivo, thecla1−1 mutant was treated with 1 mm[2-13C]DX for 15 days. Again, the rescue of the albino phenotype nearly to wild-type confirmed that [2-13C]DX was metabolized as required. To examine the role of the MEP pathway in GA biosynthesis, we first determined the incorporation of [2-13C]DX intoent-kaurene, a tetracyclic hydrocarbon precursor for all GAs, by GC-MS. Because ent-kaurene accumulates at low levels in Arabidopsis seedlings (data not shown), plants were treated with 1 μm uniconazole for 3 days to blockent-kaurene metabolism before GC-MS analysis (21Okada K. Kawaide H. Kuzuyama T. Seto H. Curtis I.S. Kamiya Y. Planta. 2002; 215: 339-344Google Scholar). Ifent-kaurene is synthesized from [2-13C]DX through the MEP pathway, four 13C atoms would be introduced at the positions shown in Fig. 3(Route 2). Consistent with this prediction, the mass spectrum of ent-kaurene from the [2-13C]DX-treated cla1−1 plants indicated a peak at m/z 276, which corresponds to the molecular ion with four 13C atoms per molecule (Table I). The peak atm/z 229 [M-43]+ of non-labeledent-kaurene is a fragment ion after loss of ring D (C3H4 and three hydrogen atoms) (Fig. 3), as previously demonstrated by deuterium-labeling experiments (32Gaskin P. MacMillan J. GC-MS of the Gibberellins and Related Compounds: Methodology and a Library of Spectra. University of Bristol, Oxford1991: 69-70Google Scholar). Importantly, the corresponding ion peak from the [2-13C]DX-treated plants was observed atm/z 232 ([M-44]+). This indicates the loss of one 13C label in ring D and is consistent with the predicted labeling pattern through the MEP pathway from [2-13C]DX. To confirm this result, we analyzedent-kaurene produced from [2-13C]MVA by a cell-free system from C. maxima endosperm (27Saito T. Abe H. Yamane H. Sakurai A. Murofushi N. Takio K. Takahashi N. Kamiya Y. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1239-1245Google Scholar, 28Graebe J.E. Bowen D.H. MacMillan J. Planta. 1972; 102: 261-271Google Scholar), where ring D would not contain 13C-labels (Fig. 3,Route 3). GC-MS showed that four 13C atoms per molecule were incorporated into ent-kaurene and that the corresponding fragment ion was at m/z 233 ([M-43]+). Subtraction of natural 13C abundance revealed that 99% of the C5 building blocks had been derived from [2-13C]DX through the MEP pathway in the cla1−1 seedling (33Rauschenbach P. Schmidt H.L. Simon H. Tykva R. Wenzel M. Messung von Radioaktiven und Stabilen Isotopen.

Open table in a new tab Feeding experiments were carried out in MS liquid media supplemented with 3% sucrose (total 15 days of incubation). KRI, Kovats retention index. Mevastatin inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in the MVA pathway and causes severe growth inhibition, which is restored by simultaneous application of MVL. To study the involvement of the MVA pathway in GA biosynthesis, [2-13C]MVL was fed to Arabidopsisseedlings that were incubated with mevastatin to label MVA-derived isoprenoids (34Choe S. Noguchi T. Fujioka S. Takatsuto S. Tissier C.P. Gregory B.D. Ross A.S. Tanaka A. Yoshida S. Tax F.E. Feldmann K.A. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 207-221Google Scholar). In our liquid culture conditions, 10 μmmevastatin was effective in inhibiting seedling growth, and this inhibitory effect was nearly completely abolished by the addition of 3 mm MVL (Fig. 2 B). ent-Kaurene was analyzed by GC-MS from seedlings that were treated with 10 μm mevastatin and 3 mm[2-13C]MVL. In addition to the molecular ion atm/z 272, four isotope peaks atm/z 273, 274, 275, and 276 were observed, indicating that 1–4 13C labels were introduced intoent-kaurene (Table I). Subtraction of natural13C abundance indicated that [2-13C]MVL provided 53% of the isoprene units to ent-kaurene under this condition. As discussed above, the mass spectrum ofent-kaurene produced from [2-13C]MVA through the MVA pathway contains a fragment ion at m/z233 ([M-43]+), because ring D of ent-kaurene would not be labeled with 13C. Considering the amount of13C incorporation (53%) calculated from the molecular ion cluster, the relative intensity of the fragment ion atm/z 233 confirms the incorporation of [2-13C]MVL into ent-kaurene through the MVA pathway. These results illustrate that the MVA pathway also contributes to the biosynthesis of ent-kaurene in Arabidopsisseedlings. Our feeding experiments showed that both the MEP and MVA pathways can provide precursors for the biosynthesis of ent-kaurene. To study the contributions of these two pathways to cytosolic sterol biosynthesis inArabidopsis seedlings, the incorporation of [2-13C]DX and [2-13C]MVL into campesterol was analyzed by GC-MS. The mass spectrum of campesterol-TMS from the [2-13C]MVL-fed seedlings showed that 98% of its isoprene units was 13C-labeled (Table I). A peak atm/z 477, which corresponds to the molecular ion with five 13C atoms per molecule, is in agreement with the expected labeling pattern because one of the six 13C-labels introduced in the precursor squalene will be eliminated by C-4 demethylation during campesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 3, Route 4). The fragment ion peak at m/z 343 ([M-129]+) of non-labeled campesterol-TMS is attributed to loss of C-1, -2, and -3 and a TMS-ether group of the A-ring (35Goad J.L. Akihisa T. Analysis of Sterols. Blackie Academic and Professional, London1997: 158-159Google Scholar), as shown in Fig. 3. The corresponding fragment ion from the [2-13C]MVL-fed seedlings at m/z 347 ([M-130]+), which indicates loss of one13C-label, is consistent with the predicted labeling pattern (Fig. 3). To examine the role of MEP pathway in cytosolic sterol synthesis, campesterol was analyzed in the [2-13C]DX-treatedcla1−1 seedlings by GC-MS. Campesterol can be labeled with13C at six positions when [3-13C]IPP, originating from [2-13C]DX, is incorporated (Fig. 3,Route 1), in contrast to the five13C atoms incorporated from [2-13C]MVL. The mass spectrum of campesterol-TMS from [2-13C]DX-fedcla1−1 seedlings showed a peak at m/z478 (Table I). This indicated that a maximum of six 13C atoms were incorporated per molecule, which is consistent with the incorporation of IPP/DMAPP derived from [2-13C]DX into cytosolic campesterol biosynthesis. Furthermore, considering the amount of 13C incorporation (27%) estimated from the molecular ion cluster, the relative abundance of the fragment ion atm/z 349 indicates no 13C label at C-1 of the A-ring. This observation agrees with the expected labeling pattern through the MEP pathway from [2-13C]DX (Route 1). These results indicate that the MVA pathway also contributes to the biosynthesis of campesterol inArabidopsis seedlings. Althoughent-kaurene is a common intermediate for all GAs, it is also known to serve as a precursor for other diterpenoids such as stevioside in S. rebaudiana (22Totté N. Charon L. Rohmer M. Compernolle F. Baboeuf I. Geuns J.M.C. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000; 41: 6407-6410Google Scholar) and kaurenolides in C. maxima (36Hedden P. Graebe J.E. Phytochemistry. 1981; 20: 1011-1015Google Scholar, 37Blechschmidt S. Castel U. Gaskin P. Hedden P. Graebe J.E. MacMillan J. Phytochemistry. 1984; 23: 553-558Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, it has not been established whether ent-kaurene serves as a precursor solely for GAs. To determine conclusively the role of MEP pathway in the biosynthesis of GAs, we analyzed GA12 from the [2-13C]DX-treated cla1−1 plants by GC-MS. GA12 is the first GA in the GA biosynthesis pathway and is converted to biologically active forms by several oxidation steps. Because GAs accumulate to very low levels in plants and this analysis required much more tissue, we set up new liquid culture conditions to grow the plants on a larger scale. In the new system, we reduced the sucrose concentration to 1% (formerly 3%) to reduce the chance of fungal contamination. The mass spectrum of GA12 methyl ester from [2-13C]DX-fed cla1−1 seedlings demonstrated the incorporation of four 13C labels per molecule, illustrating the contribution of the MEP pathway to its biosynthesis. The incorporation of [2-13C]DX into GA12(88%), which was determined after subtraction of the natural13C abundance, was similar to that of [2-13C]DX into ent-kaurene (87%) at the same concentration of the substrate (Tables IIand III). To examine the role of the MVA pathway in GA biosynthesis, another large scale culture was carried out to test the incorporation of [2-13C]MVL in the presence of mevastatin. GC-MS analysis showed that 7 and 5% of the isoprene units of GA12 and ent-kaurene, respectively, came from [2-13C]MVL (Tables II and III), indicating a minor contribution of the MVA pathway to the synthesis of GA12 through ent-kaurene.Table IIIncorporation of [2-13C]DX and [2-13C]MVL into GA12KRIMass spectrumaThe intensity of base ion peak was set as 100%.% IncorporationbIncorporation rate was calculated from fragment ion peaks atm/z 300–305 after the subtraction of natural 13C abundance.Molecular ionFragment ion% relative intensityGA12 methyl esterStandard2389360 (5) 361 (1)300 (100) 301 (24) 302 (3)[2-13C]DX/cla1–1 cThe cla1–1 seedlings were fed with 0.8 mm [2-13C]DX2389364 (2)300 (5) 301 (12) 302 (17) 303 (34) 304 (100) 305 (28)88[2-13C]MVL/mevastatindThe wild-type seedlings were fed with 3 mm[2-13C]MVL in the presence of mevastatin.2389360 (3) 361 (2)300 (100) 301 (38) 302 (14) 303 (4)7Feeding experiments were carried out in MS liquid medium supplemented with 1% sucrose (total 15 days of incubation).

KRI, Kovats retention index. Feeding experiments were carried out in the MS liquid medium supplemented with 1% sucrose (total 15 days of incubation). Our feeding experiments showed a minor role of the MVA pathway in ent-kaurene synthesis. To examine how this minor incorporation affects plant growth, we analyzed the effect of exogenous MVL on the phenotype ofcla1−1 seedlings. Fig. 2 C shows thatcla1−1 seedlings accumulate green-yellow pigments in the presence of 1–3 mm MVL. However, the cla1−1albino phenotype was not fully rescued even at higher doses of MVL (data not shown). These results support our conclusion that the MVA pathway plays a minor role in the isoprenoid biosynthesis in plastids, where the major route is the MEP pathway. Likewise, we treated wild-type seedlings with varying concentrations of DX in the presence of mevastatin. Exogenous DX at 0.5 and 1 mm partially rescued the growth defect caused by mevastatin (Fig. 2 D). However, the growth inhibition was not completely restored even at higher concentrations of DX in the media. These results are consistent with our GC-MS data showing that the MEP pathway can partially contribute to cytosolic sterol biosynthesis. Using feeding experiments with [2-13C]DX or [2-13C]MVL, we showed that either precursor can be incorporated into bothent-kaurene and campesterol with different efficiencies. These experiments were carried out at concentrations of exogenous [2-13C]DX or [2-13C]MVL that were sufficient to overcome the effect of the cla1−1 mutation or mevastatin, respectively, nearly completely. To investigate the mechanism for crossover between MEP and MVA pathways, we determined the incorporation of labeled precursors when the metabolic flux through one of the pathways is limited. This set of experiments was carried out in liquid culture containing 1% sucrose. The cla1−1 albino phenotype was rescued only partially by 0.2 and 0.4 mm DX (Fig. 2 A). This suggests that DX is still limiting, and therefore, the MEP pathway is not saturated. Under these conditions, [2-13C]DX was still incorporated into campesterol, although the incorporation was lower (3 and 4% at 0.2 and 0.4 mm, respectively; Table III) than that obtained with the higher concentration of [2-13C]DX (7%). Similarly, [2-13C]MVL was incorporated intoent-kaurene (8%; Table III) when mevastatin-treated plants were fed with 1 mm MVL, which did not fully rescue the growth inhibition by mevastatin (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that the incorporation of [2-13C]MVL intoent-kaurene and that of [2-13C]DX into campesterol occurs even when the MVA and MEP pathways, respectively, are limiting. Our data also showed that the concentrations of13C-labeled precursors in the media can modulate the amount of 13C incorporation into the products, which is evident by the decreased incorporation of [2-13C]DX intoent-kaurene at 0.2 mm [2-13C]DX (68%) relative to that observed at 0.8 mm[2-13C]DX (87%) (Table III). Our feeding experiments using 13C-labeled precursors have demonstrated that both MEP and MVA pathways can supply precursors for the biosynthesis of GAs in Arabidopsis seedlings. This study provides the first evidence that GAs can be synthesized through the MEP pathway. Because GAs and their precursor ent-kaurene are present at extremely low levels in plant tissues, we needed a sensitive method to monitor the incorporation of isotopically labeled intermediates. The use of mevastatin and the cla1−1mutation to block individual isoprenoid pathways allowed us to label metabolites efficiently. In stevioside biosynthesis in S. rebaudiana, feeding experiments with [1-13C]glucose and NMR were used to show that the diterpene moiety (a derivative ofent-kaurenoic acid) is synthesized through the MEP pathway. A contribution from the MVA pathway was not evident in this study. The inconsistency between this study and ours may be because of differences in plant species, tissue, or development stage, roles of the products (secondary metabolite versus growth regulator), or the inability to detect minor 13C incorporation by NMR. Because glucose can be incorporated into both the MEP and MVA pathways,13C-labeled glucose has often been used to label isoprenoids in vivo (38Adam K.P. Zapp J. Phytochemistry. 1998; 48: 953-959Google Scholar, 39Hirai N. Yoshida R. Todoroki Y. Ohigashi H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2000; 64: 1448-1458Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether exogenously applied 13C-glucose is equally distributed to the two pathways. This would be a crucial question when both MEP and MVA pathways are involved in the biosynthesis of target compounds. Crossover between the MEP and MVA pathways has been demonstrated in the biosynthesis of several terpenoids in other plant species using isotopically labeled DX or MVL (2Rohmer M. Nat. Prod. Rep. 1999; 16: 565-574Google Scholar, 40Schwender J. Gemünden C. Lichtenthaler H.K. Planta. 2001; 212: 416-423Google Scholar, 41Arigoni D. Sagner S. Latzel C. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10600-10605Google Scholar, 42Piel J. Donath J. Bandemer K. Boland W. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998; 37: 2478-2481Google Scholar). However, in all cases, cellular concentrations of the precursor appeared to be elevated because the labeled compounds were fed to plants without reducing the endogenous levels of these precursors. By inhibiting each isoprenoid pathway and monitoring the phenotypic changes at different doses of the labeled precursors, we were able to estimate the status of isoprenoid pathways. This helped us to predict whether the feeding experiments were done under physiologically relevant conditions. Our results showed that the concentrations of [2-13C]DX in the media can greatly affect the ratio of 13C labels in the products (Table III). Thus, the 13C incorporation determined in different feeding experiments must be carefully interpreted. When the MEP pathway is limiting in the cla1−1 seedlings at 0.2 mm DX (judged by the incomplete recovery of thecla1−1 phenotype; Fig. 2 A), the incorporation of [2-13C]DX into ent-kaurene was only 68%, whereas it increased to 87% at a higher [2-13C]DX concentration. It is unclear at present whether the reduced labeling ratio at the lower dose of [2-13C]DX is due to the leaky nature of the cla1−1 mutant (e.g. presence of isozymes) or to the crossover from the MVA pathway. These observations indicate that the amount of 13C incorporation into the product does not necessarily reflect the relative contribution of each pathway under normal growth conditions. These results also suggest that the relative contribution of each isoprenoid pathway could vary when either pathway is up- or down-regulated during plant development or in response to environmental conditions. Nevertheless, we postulate that the MEP and MVA pathways play a major role in the biosynthesis of ent-kaurene and campesterol, respectively, in Arabidopsis seedlings. When incubated with 0.8 mm [2-13C]DX, 87% of the C5units of ent-kaurene came from [2-13C]DX, whereas DX fed under the same conditions provided only 7% of the isoprene units to campesterol. This demonstrates that the MEP pathway is not the primary route for the biosynthesis of campesterol. Similarly, we can conclude that the MVA pathway plays a minor role in the formation of ent-kaurene based on the much lower incorporation of [2-13C]MVL into ent-kaurene relative to that into campesterol (Table III). Our current study provides a new view regarding the crossover between two isoprenoid pathways. The incorporation of MVL intoent-kaurene was still observed when the growth inhibition caused by mevastatin was not fully restored by MVL. In this situation, the MVA pathway is likely to be limiting, whereas there is no obvious reason that the MEP pathway is inhibited. Therefore, it appears that [2-13C]MVL can be incorporated intoent-kaurene against a concentration gradient. To better understand this problem, the common isoprenoid intermediate(s) (e.g. IPP, DMAPP, or geranylgeranyl diphosphate) responsible for the crossover between two isoprenoid pathways needs to be determined. An active uptake of IPP into isolated plastids in a facilitated-diffusion manner (43Kreuz K. Kleinig H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 531-535Google Scholar, 44Bauerle R. Lutke-Brinkhaus F. Ortmann B. Berger S. Kleinig H. Planta. 1990; 181: 229-233Google Scholar, 45Soler E. Clastre M. Bantignies B. Marigo G. Ambid C. Planta. 1993; 191: 324-329Google Scholar) implies that IPP may be involved in the precursor exchange between the MVA and MEP pathways. It is interesting to note that the cla1−1 phenotype was rescued only partially even at a high dose of MVL (Fig. 2 C). This demonstrates that the MEP pathway is still required for normal plant growth even when the flux of MVA pathway is elevated. Taken together, our current data suggest that the uptake of an intermediate from the MVA pathway into the isoprenoid pathway in plastids does occur, but that this mechanism is not sufficient to fully complement the defect in the MEP pathway. This also appears to be true for the other direction, uptake from the MEP pathway to the MVA pathway. We noted that the incorporation of labeled precursors intoent-kaurene and campesterol was greater in our first set of experiments performed in 3% sucrose than in the second set in 1% sucrose. This observation suggests that sucrose concentrations may affect the uptake of 13C-labeled substrates by plants and/or the status of two isoprenoid pathways. In summary, our study showed that both isoprenoid pathways are involved in the biosynthesis of GAs, which are growth-promoting hormones in plants. We predict that the relative contribution of each pathway may be modulated during plant development, by environmental cues and by the status of the other pathway. Molecular genetic approaches in the model species Arabidopsis would be useful to uncover how each isoprenoid pathway is regulated and whether the crossover plays any role in controlling isoprenoid biosynthesis in cytoplasm and plastids.

During interphase, cohesin is required for the establishment of cohesion following DNA replication. Because cohesin mutants resulted in increased sensitivity to DNA damage, a role for cohesin in DNA repair was also suggested. However, it was unclear whether this was due to general perturbation of cohesion or whether cohesin has a specialized role at the damage site. We therefore used a laser microbeam to create DNA damage at discrete sites in the cell nucleus and observed specificin vivo assembly of proteins at these sites by immunofluorescent detection. We observed that human cohesin is recruited to the damage site immediately after damage induction. Analysis of mutant cells revealed that cohesin recruitment to the damage site is dependent on the DNA double-strand break repair factor Mre11/Rad50 but not ATM or Nbs1. Consistently, Mre11/Rad50 and cohesin interact with each other in an interphase-specific manner. This interaction peaks in S/G2 phase, during which cohesin is recruited to the DNA damage.

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining; HR, homologous recombination; SMC, structural maintenance ofchromosomes; A-T, ataxia-telangiectasia; ATLD, ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder; NBS, Nijmegen breakage syndrome; NuMA, nuclear mitotic apparatus; h, human; IRIF, ionizing radiation-induced foci. occur during normal DNA replication and can also be induced by exogenous agents such as gamma irradiation. Two pathways have evolved to repair DSBs: nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which is error-prone; and homologous recombination (HR), which is error-free (for review, see Refs. 1Khanna K.K. Jackson S.P. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 247-254Google Scholarand 2Haber J.E. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 259-264Google Scholar). Because HR prefers the homologous sister chromatid as a template, HR repair is the main pathway for postreplicative repair during late S/G2 phase, whereas NHEJ is utilized in G1/early S phase. NHEJ and HR require distinct sets of factors, except for the trimeric complex Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 that appears to be involved in an early step in both NHEJ and HR. Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 are essential proteins in mammals, and they play critical roles in both cell cycle checkpoint activation and DNA repair (3Luo G. Yao M.S. Bender C.F. Mills M. Bladl A.R.

Tessarollo L. Nussenzweig A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 105-109Google Scholar). Unlike Nbs1, Mre11 and Rad50 are conserved between yeast and mammals and are able to form a subcomplex (Mre-Rad50) (6de Jager M. van Noort J. van Gent D.C. Dekker C. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1129-1135Google Scholar). Mre11 is an exo- and endonuclease, whereas Rad50 has a coiled-coil structure with an ATPase motif, distantly related to thestructural maintenance ofchromosomes (SMC) family of proteins. Although Nbs1 is not absolutely required in vitro, DNA binding and the enzymatic activity of Mre11-Rad50 are enhanced in the presence of Nbs1 (7Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Google Scholar). Thus, Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 most likely plays an important role in DNA end processing for subsequent repair. ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia, mutated), a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, is a major DSB signal transducer and is critical for activating G1/S, S, and G2/M checkpoints upon DNA damage. ATM was found to phosphorylate Nbs1 upon DSB induction, which is required for the DNA damage response by Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 (8Wu X. Ranganathan V. Weisman D.S. Heine W.F. Ciccone D.N. O'Neill T.B.

ATM is mutated in patients with the pleiotropic genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) (10Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Google Scholar). A-T cells exhibit sensitivity to ionizing irradiation, chromosome instability, and radioresistant DNA synthesis, an S phase checkpoint defect. Mutations in Mre11 and Nbs1 were found in AT-like disorder (ATLD) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), respectively (11Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates 3rd, J.R.

Wilson R.K. Digweed M. Rosenthal A. Sperling K. Concannon P. Reis A. Cell. 1998; 93: 467-476Google Scholar). These two diseases also share similar cellular phenotypes with A-T. Cohesin is a conserved protein complex essential for sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation. It contains two SMC family proteins, SMC1 and SMC3, and the non-SMC components Rad21 (Scc1/Mcd1) and SA1/SA2 (Scc3) (14Hirano T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 115-144Google Scholar). SMC1 and SMC3 also exist as a free heterodimer in the cell, the function of which is not clear (15Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Google Scholar). In vertebrates, a majority of cohesin associates with chromosomal DNA in an interphase-specific manner. This association peaks during S phase, with subsequent dissociation during late G2/prophase and reassociation in telophase (15Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Google Scholar, 16Gregson H.C. Schmiesing J.A. Kim J.-S. Kobayashi T. Zhou S. Yokomori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47575-47582Google Scholar, 17Sumara I. Vorlaufer E. Gieffers C. Peters B.H. Peters J.-M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 749-761Google Scholar). Cohesin is required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion following DNA replication (15Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Google Scholar). The potential function of cohesin in the DNA damage response was suggested by the original identification of the cohesin component Rad21 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe as one of the Rad genes, whose mutation makes the cell sensitive to DSBs (18Birkenbihl R.P. Subramani S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 25: 6605-6611Google Scholar). Rad21 depletion in a vertebrate was also associated with increased radiation sensitivity (19Sonoda E. Matsusaka T. Morrison C. Vagnarelli P. Hoshi O. Ushiki T. Nojima K. Fukagawa T. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Earnshaw W.C. Takeda S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 759-770Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cohesin was shown to be required for postreplicative DSB repair (20Sjögren C. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 991-995Google Scholar). It was suggested that sister chromatid cohesion is required for homologous recombination. However, it was unclear whether the effect of cohesin on DNA repair was through its genome-wide cohesion function or through a specialized role at the damage sites. In this article, we demonstrate the specific recruitment of human cohesin to DSB damage and its interaction with DSB repair factors, suggesting its direct role in DNA damage recognition and repair. A specific region of a submicroliter volume inside the cell nucleus was irradiated by focusing a second harmonic (532 nm) of a pulsed neodymium:ytrium aluminum garnet laser within the selected Z plane through an epifluorescence port of a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal system. An approximately 5-μm line was scanned continuously for 2 min. System parameters used (2–3 μJ/pulse energy after 100× Ph3, numerical aperture 1.3 oil immersion Zeiss Neofluar objective, 4–6-ns pulse duration, 7.5 Hz) are similar to those used for mitotic chromosome cutting or nuclear body ablation and correspond to irradiances 2–3 times higher than the estimated threshold values of optical breakdown in water (21Venugopalan V. Guerra III, A. Nahen K. Vogel A. Phys. Rev. Lett. 2002; 88: 078103Google Scholar, 22Krasieva T.B. Chapman C.F. LaMorte V.J. Venugopalan V. Tromberg B.J. Proc. Soc. Photo-opt. Instrum. Eng. 1998; 3260: 38-44Google Scholar). After microirradiation, cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against various proteins. Typically 4–6 cells/plate, using up to seven plates, were microirradiated and fixed within 3–20 min post-irradiation. Cell viability was confirmed by morphology. At least three independent experiments were carried out for different cells and cell cycle stages. Staining was repeated multiple times for each antibody. HeLa cells, the wild-type human fibroblast IMR-90 (American Type Culture Collection), and Mre11 mutant fibroblasts derived from an ATLD patient (ATLD2(D6867) (12Stewart G.S. Maser R.S. Stankovic T.

The human A-T fibroblast cell line (GM02052D) and NBS fibroblast cell line (GM07166) were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repositories. HeLa cells were synchronized to the S and G2phases by a double thymidine block and to M and G1 phases by an additional nocodazole treatment as described previously (23Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Google Scholar). Synchronization efficiency was typically more than 90% (16Gregson H.C. Schmiesing J.A. Kim J.-S. Kobayashi T. Zhou S. Yokomori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47575-47582Google Scholar). For laser microirradiation of G1 cells, synchronized mitotic cells were marked on gridded coverslips, continuously observed to confirm their division, and subjected to laser microirradiation 5 h after the nocodazole release. Antigen affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against hSMC1, hSMC3, SA1 (cross-reactive to SA2), and CNAP1 were described previously (16Gregson H.C. Schmiesing J.A. Kim J.-S. Kobayashi T. Zhou S. Yokomori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47575-47582Google Scholar, 23Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for Mre11, Rad50, ATM, BRCA1, and Rad51 (GeneTex), Nbs1 (BD Biosciences), poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP; Trevigen), NuMA (Oncogene Research Products), and anti-acetylated histone H4 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) were used. Donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa-488 or Alexa-546 and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa-546 were from Molecular Probes. Cells were fixed and stained as described (23Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Google Scholar). Broken DNA ends were labeled with BrdUrd in the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and visualized with Alexa 488-conjugated mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody as described previously (24Nelms B.E. Maser R.S. MacKay J.F. Lagally M.G. Petrini J.H. Science. 1998; 280: 590-592Google Scholar). Immunofluorescent images were captured using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 410). Coimmunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (16Gregson H.C. Schmiesing J.A. Kim J.-S. Kobayashi T. Zhou S. Yokomori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47575-47582Google Scholar). Preimmune IgG was used as a negative control. The antibody-protein complex on protein A beads was washed in HEMG buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 12.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 or 0.5 m KCl in the presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with 2 mguanidine-HCl. Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitations were also carried out in the presence of 300 μg of ethidium bromide (EtBr)/ml to remove contaminating DNA as described previously (23Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6996-7006Google Scholar). We first determined whether it was possible to introduce DNA damage at a discrete site in the cell nucleus by focusing a visible 532 nm pulsed neodymium:ytrium laser microbeam to a selected Z plane of less than 1 μm in depth. The cell membranes of the irradiated cells were intact, and cells remained viable during the experiments. We observed their viability up to 30 h post-irradiation (data not shown). The presence of the DNA breaks was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated BrdUrd incorporation at the broken DNA ends (Fig. 1 A). After microirradiation, cells were fixed within 3–20 min and stained with antibodies against various proteins to determine their immediate recruitment. Consistent with the published results using γ-irradiation, the factors known to recognize DSBs, including Mre11, Rad50, Ku, BRCA1, and poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1, clustered to the damage site (24Nelms B.E. Maser R.S. MacKay J.F. Lagally M.G. Petrini J.H. Science. 1998; 280: 590-592Google Scholar, 25Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr.

In contrast, no enrichment for CNAP1, acetylated histone H4, or thenuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) was detected at the sites of damage. CNAP1 (or hCAP-D2/Eg7) is a component of condensin, a different SMC-containing complex that is required for chromosome condensation (23Schmiesing J.A. Gregson H.C. Zhou S. Yokomori K. Mol. Cell.

Tomonaga T. Mochida S. Yanagida M. Nature. 2002; 417: 197-202Google Scholar). NuMA is a nuclear matrix-associated protein (29Lydersen B.K. Pettijohn D.E. Cell. 1980; 22: 489-499Google Scholar). We found that upon microirradiation, the damaged site transiently changed its optical property and appeared as a distinct line. This served as a marker for the damage site (Fig.1 A). Duration of its appearance, however, did not correlate with recruited protein localization (data not shown). Taken together, our method allows detection of in vivo factor recruitment to a DNA damage site. Using this system, we tested the potential recruitment of cohesin to the laser-induced damage. Cohesin was recruited to the damage sites, which was detected by antibodies against both SMC (hSMC1) and non-SMC (SA1/SA2) components of cohesin to distinguish from the free SMC heterodimer (Fig. 1 B). Similar recruitment was observed in both HeLa and nontransformed human fibroblast IMR-90 cells (Figs.1 B and 2 A). Thus, this is not a cancer cell-specific phenomenon. We further tested cohesin localization in mutant fibroblast cells derived from A-T, NBS, and ATLD patients. Cohesin and Mre11-Rad50 recruitment to the damage site was unaffected in A-T cells (Fig. 2 B). Recruitment of Mre11-Rad50 to the damage site in A-T cells is consistent with a recent report using γ-irradiation (30Mirzoeva O.K. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 281-288Google Scholar). Furthermore, both cohesin and Mre11-Rad50 were efficiently recruited to the damaged sites in NBS cells (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, cohesin failed to cluster at the damage site in the Mre11-mutated ATLD2 cells (Fig. 2 D). In these cells, the level of Rad50 is also down-regulated, likely due to a secondary effect of the mutation of Mre11 (12Stewart G.S. Maser R.S. Stankovic T. Bressan D.A. Kaplan M.I. Jaspers N.G.J. Raams A. Byrd P.J. Petrini J.H. Taylor A.M.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 577-587Google Scholar). These results indicate that Mre11 or Rad50 (or both) plays a crucial role in recruitment of cohesin to the sites of DNA damage. Consistent with the requirement of Mre11-Rad50 for cohesin recruitment to DNA damage, there is a specific in vivo interaction between cohesin and Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50. Coimmunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins in the nuclear extract of undamaged asynchronous HeLa cells revealed that anti-Rad50 antibody coprecipitated hSMC1 in a 0.5 m KCl-resistant manner (Fig. 3 A). Rad51, an eukaryotic RecA homologue involved in the HR pathway of DSB repair, was also shown to be recruited to the DNA damage (31Tashiro S. Walter J. Shinohara A. Kamada N. Cremer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 283-291Google Scholar). However, anti-Rad51 failed to coprecipitate hSMC1 in this experiment, supporting the specificity of the interaction between Rad50 (Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50) and hSMC1 (cohesin) (Fig. 3 A). This interaction was further confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation with antibodies specific for hSMC1 and hSMC3, both of which coprecipitated Rad50, whereas preimmune IgG did not (Fig. 3 B). EtBr treatment of the sample did not affect the interaction, demonstrating that the interaction between cohesin and Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 is not mediated by DNA (Fig. 3 C). This is consistent with the notion that Rad51 is also a DNA-binding protein but fails to interact with cohesin (Fig.3 A). Some cohesin was found in the 0.5 m KCl wash fraction, whereas Mre11 was exclusively in the 0.5 mKCl-resistant eluate of the Rad50 coimmunoprecipitation, indicating that not all cohesin tightly associates with Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 (Fig.3 C). The interaction between cohesin and Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 was also observed in human fibroblasts (Fig. 3 D). Anti-Rad50 antibody coprecipitated cohesin and Mre11 in both NBS and A-T cells, indicating that cohesin is capable of interacting with Mre11-Rad50 in the absence of the wild-type Nbs1 or ATM. This finding is consistent with the observed recruitment of both Mre11-Rad50 and cohesin to DNA damage in these cells (Fig. 2, B and C). In synchronized HeLa cells, the interaction between cohesin and Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 was shown to be interphase-specific even though both complexes are present during mitosis (Fig. 3 E) (16Gregson H.C. Schmiesing J.A. Kim J.-S. Kobayashi T. Zhou S. Yokomori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47575-47582Google Scholar). The interaction exists in cells most abundantly in S/G2 phases without any exogenous damage induction, correlating with the peak of chromatin association and sister chromatid cohesion function of cohesin (15Losada A. Hirano M. Hirano T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1986-1997Google Scholar, 16Gregson H.C. Schmiesing J.A. Kim J.-S. Kobayashi T. Zhou S. Yokomori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47575-47582Google Scholar). A similar interaction pattern was seen with ATM (Fig.3 E). Interestingly, cohesin recruitment to the site of damage coincides with the peak of its interaction with Mre11-Rad50 in S/G2phases. Upon laser damage induction in synchronized HeLa cells at G1, S, or G2 phase, the recruitment of Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 was observed in both G1 and S/G2 phases, consistent with its involvement in both NHEJ and HR (Fig. 4). However, cohesin recruitment to damage is limited to S and G2 phases, but not in G1 phase, suggesting that cohesin is active for DNA damage recognition in an S/G2-specific fashion. These results indicate that cohesin requires an S/G2-specific factor(s) or modification(s), in addition to Mre11-Rad50, for its recruitment to DNA damage. These results suggest that cohesin specifically participates in the DSB damage response in S/G2 phase, possibly in the HR but not the NHEJ pathway. Laser microbeams (optical scissors) as well as optical tweezers made it possible to micromanipulate or ablate cells or subcellular structures, including chromosomes, in a highly specific manner (32Berns M.W. Tadir Y. Liang H. Tromberg B. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 55: 71-98Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that tightly focused visible light (532 nm) of a pulsed neodymium:ytrium aluminum garnet laser induces DNA breaks at a defined region in the cell nucleus and evokes DSB repair factor recruitment to the site of damage. Several other methods were previously developed to introduce DNA damage in a defined region in the nucleus. A study using partial volume irradiation, in which the cell was γ-irradiated in a striped pattern using a gridded shield, demonstrated for the first time the recruitment of Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 to the sites of DNA damage as early as 30 min after irradiation (24Nelms B.E. Maser R.S. MacKay J.F. Lagally M.G. Petrini J.H. Science. 1998; 280: 590-592Google Scholar). However, this method did not allow monitoring at the earlier time points during which DNA damage recognition and initial factor recruitment take place. An alternative technique of inducing damage using ultraviolet (UV) microirradiation in the presence of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was recently shown to induce DSBs efficiently at specific sites in the nucleus. This damage was accompanied by recruitment of several DNA repair proteins including Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50, BRCA1, and Rad51 (25Paull T.T. Rogakou E.P. Yamazaki V. Kirchgessner C.U. Gellert M. Bonner W.M. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 886-895Google Scholar, 31Tashiro S. Walter J. Shinohara A. Kamada N. Cremer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 283-291Google Scholar, 33Rogakou E.P. Boon C. Redon C. Bonner W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 905-915Google Scholar). However, the presence of a halogenated thymidine analogue and the secondary effects of UV have to be taken into consideration. In our method, which does not require any chromophore or other exogenous agent, collateral damage is minimal because the visible green light used is harmless in the unfocused areas due to its insufficient energy density. Thus, this method provides a useful tool to dissect the immediate damage response in the cell. Using this system, we observed that a subpopulation of cohesin is recruited to sites of damage in an Mre11-Rad50 (but not Nbs1)-dependent and S/G2-specific manner in human cells. Recently, hSMC1 was shown to be phosphorylated by ATM in an Nbs1-dependent manner upon DSB induction and to participate in S phase checkpoint control (34Kim S.-T. Xu B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 560-570Google Scholar, 35Yazdi P.T. Wang Y. Zhao S. Patel N. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Google Scholar). However, our results revealed that the initial damage recognition/recruitment of cohesin is independent of this process. The DNA damage response defects in A-T and NBS cells are not due to the impairment of cohesin or Mre11-Rad50 recruitment to DNA damage, suggesting that ATM and Nbs1 are not required for the initial recruitment of Mre11-Rad50 or cohesin to DNA damage sites. This finding was somewhat surprising, as Mre11-Rad50 was mislocalized in NBS cells and failed to form ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF), which was thought to be indicative of the lack of recruitment of Mre11-Rad50 to the DNA damage sites (11Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates 3rd, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Google Scholar). However, impairment of IRIF formation in NBS cells was observed at later time points when the vast majority of DSB repair is complete (11Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates 3rd, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Google Scholar). Thus, late-forming IRIF may not be an ideal indicator of the immediate DNA damage response. Furthermore, our data are not inconsistent with the previous in vitro observation that Mre11 and Rad50 forms a stable complex in the absence of Nbs1 and tethers DNA ends (6de Jager M. van Noort J. van Gent D.C. Dekker C. Kanaar R. Wyman C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1129-1135Google Scholar). Because Nbs1 is important for ATP-driven DNA unwinding and the endonuclease activity of Mre11-Rad50 in vitro (7Paull T.T. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1276-1288Google Scholar), it is possible that the recruited Mre11-Rad50 may be unstable or functionally compromised in NBS cells. An alternative but not mutually exclusive possibility is that the primary role of Nbs1 is to transduce checkpoint signals rather than to be involved in actual DNA repair in somatic cells, and that the increased radiation sensitivity of the mutant cells is caused primarily by the checkpoint defect. The interaction between cohesin and Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 occurs in the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage. A role for Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 in the repair of DNA damage that arises during normal DNA replication has been suggested (36Maser R.S. Mirzoeva O.K. Wells J. OLIVARES H. Williams B.R. Zinkel R.A. Farnham P.J. Petrini J.H.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6006-6016Google Scholar). Because the interaction peaks during S/G2 phases, it is tempting to speculate that cohesin plays a role in the housekeeping DNA repair process together with Mre11-Nbs1-Rad50 under normal conditions. Depletion of cohesin in chicken cells led to chromosome instability in the absence of DNA damaging agents (19Sonoda E. Matsusaka T. Morrison C. Vagnarelli P. Hoshi O. Ushiki T. Nojima K. Fukagawa T. Waizenegger I.C. Peters J.M. Earnshaw W.C. Takeda S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 759-770Google Scholar), which may have been caused by impairment of such a housekeeping DNA repair mechanism in addition to segregation defects. What is the function of cohesin at the DNA damage sites? It was shown that cohesin binds to DNA and stimulates intermolecular ligation of linear DNA molecules in the presence of DNA ligase in vitro(37Losada A. Hirano T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 268-272Google Scholar). Thus, cohesin may facilitate the DNA repair process by forming protein-DNA aggregates and promoting interaction of the broken ends of DNA. However, this does not fully explain why cohesin recruitment is S/G2-specific despite the association of cohesin with chromatin DNA in G1 at a level comparable with that in G2 in human cells (16Gregson H.C. Schmiesing J.A. Kim J.-S. Kobayashi T. Zhou S. Yokomori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47575-47582Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is conceivable that cohesin is involved strictly in DSB checkpoint control as suggested by the recent finding of a link between hSMC1 phosphorylation and S phase checkpoint activation (34Kim S.-T. Xu B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 560-570Google Scholar, 35Yazdi P.T. Wang Y. Zhao S. Patel N. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 571-582Google Scholar). However, the role of the recruited cohesin in G2 phase is less clear, as a study in yeast showed that cohesin is not involved in G2/M checkpoint control (20Sjögren C. Nasmyth K. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 991-995Google Scholar). Because cohesin is active in sister chromatid cohesion during this time, it is also possible that cohesin is recruited to establish local cohesion de novo at damage sites and to bring the homologous regions of the sister chromatids together to promote the HR process (Fig.5). The system described in the current study will be useful in further investigation of the molecular requirement for cohesin targeting and function at the damage site and in dissecting the process of DSB recognition and factor assembly in mammalian cells.

An induction site activated by l-tryptophan is created in the translating ribosome during synthesis of TnaC, the 24-residue leader peptide. Replacing the tnaC stop codon with a tryptophan codon allows tryptophan-charged tryptophan transfer RNA to substitute for tryptophan as inducer. This suggests that the ribosomal A site occupied by the tryptophanyl moiety of the charged transfer RNA is the site of induction. The location of tryptophan-12 of nascent TnaC in the peptide exit tunnel was crucial for induction. These results show that a nascent peptide sequence can influence translation continuation and termination within a translating ribosome."

We document both vertical and horizontal displacements of several millimeters to several centimeters across kilometer-wide zones centered on pre-existing faults. Portions of some faults experienced retrograde (that is, opposite to their long-term geologic slip) motion during or shortly after the earthquake. The observed deformation likely represents elastic response of compliant fault zones to the permanent co-seismic stress changes. The induced fault displacements imply decreases in the effective shear modulus within the kilometer-wide fault zones, indicating that the latter are mechanically distinct from the ambient crustal rocks."

A related protein, SERPH, has also been described in P. falciparum. Whereas their biological role remains unknown, both proteins possess papain-like protease domains that may provide attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.

In this paper, the expression and functional relevance of these eight genes and of a ninth SERA homologue found on chromosome 9 were examined in blood stage parasites. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR and microarray approaches, we demonstrate that whereas mRNA to all nine SERA genes is synthesized late in the erythrocytic cycle, it is those genes in the central region of the chromosome 2 cluster that are substantially up-regulated at this time. Using antibodies specific to each SERA, it was apparent that SERA4 to -6, and possibly also SERA9, are synthesized in blood stage parasites. The reactivity of antibodies from malaria-immune individuals with the SERA recombinant proteins suggested that SERA2 and SERA3 are also expressed at least in some parasite populations. To examine whether SERA genes are essential to blood stage growth, each of the eight chromosome 2 SERA genes was targeted for disruption. Whereas genes at the periphery of the cluster were mostly dispensable (SERA2 and -3 andSERA7 and -8), those in the central region (SERA4 to -6) could not be disrupted.

Malaria remains one of the most devastating diseases of mankind. It has been estimated that there are as many as 500 million clinical cases of malaria each year including 1–2 million deaths. The emergence of widespread drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant vectors has intensified the need for novel drug target strategies and an effective vaccine. One molecule that has potential to serve both as a vaccine and a drug target to control Plasmodium falciparum, the most important cause of human malaria, is the serine repeat antigen (SERA), 1The abbreviations used are: SERA, serine repeat antigen; SERP, serine stretch protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; GST, glutathione S-transferase; KAHRP, knob-associated histidine-rich protein also known as serine stretch protein (SERP) or P126 (1Delplace P.

P. falciparum SERA/SERP is synthesized as a 113–126-kDa precursor protein and is localized to the parasitophorous vacuole (1Delplace P. Fortier B. Tronchin G. Dubremetz J.F. Vernes A. Mol. Biochem.

Synchronous with merozoite release, the precursor is processed into N-terminal 47-kDa, centrally located 56-kDa, and C-terminal 18-kDa fragments. The 47- and 18-kDa fragments remain linked by a disulfide bond(s), whereas the 56-kDa domain undergoes further processing to a 50-kDa species in a manner that is inhibited by leupeptin and E64 (1Delplace P.

This central fragment of SERA shows a high degree of homology to the papain family of cysteine proteases (6Eakin A.E. Higaki J.N. McKerrow J.H. Craik C.S.

SERA is well recognized as a vaccine candidate antigen (see Ref. 15Anders R.F. Saul A. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 444-447Google Scholar for a review). Recombinant proteins derived from the N-terminal 47-kDa domain are highly immunogenic and elicit antibodies that inhibit erythrocyte invasion and parasite replication in vitro (14Pang X.L.

Parasitol. 1991; 44: 1-13Google Scholar). This gene, termedSERPH, encodes a protein that is also localized to the parasitophorous vacuole and that has very similar characteristics to SERA, including the presence of a centrally located papain-like protease domain. The likely presence of at least one otherSERA gene homologue has also been reported (10Fox B.A. Bzik D.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 133-144Google Scholar). Recently, nucleotide sequencing of P. falciparum chromosome 2 identified the presence of eight SERA-like genes located in a cluster in a central region of the chromosome (24Gardner M.J. Tettelin H. Carucci D.J. Cummings L.M. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Shallom S. Mason T. Yu K. Fujii C. Pederson J. Shen K. Jing J. Aston C. Lai Z. Schwartz D.C. Pertea M. Salzberg S. Zhou L. Sutton G.G. Clayton R. White O. Smith H.O. Fraser C.M. Hoffman S.L. et al.Science. 1998; 282: 1126-1132Google Scholar). TheseSERA genes are arranged in a head-to-tail array withSERA and SERPH the fifth and sixth genes in the cluster, respectively. A similar cluster of five SERA -like genes has been identified in Plasmodium vivax (25Kiefer M.C. Crawford K.A. Boley L.J. Landsberg K.E. Gibson H.L. Kaslow D.C. Barr P.J. Mol. Biochem.

Vaccine. 1998; 16: 1193-1202Google Scholar). The presence of relatively large SERA multigene families in divergentPlasmodium species suggests an important biological role for the proteins encoded by these genes. Whereas all the SERA proteins are predicted to possess a central domain with strong homology with the papain family of cysteine proteases, some, including SERA itself, were found to contain a highly unusual cysteine to serine substitution in the active site position (6Eakin A.E. Higaki J.N. McKerrow J.H. Craik C.S. Nature. 1989; 342: 132Google Scholar, 7Higgins D.G. McConnell D.J. Sharp P.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 604Google Scholar, 24Gardner M.J. Tettelin H. Carucci D.J.

Furthermore, in certain P. vivax and P. vinckeiSERA homologues, substitutions were observed in other important catalytic site residues, raising the possibility that at least some of these molecules may no longer function as proteases (25Kiefer M.C. Crawford K.A. Boley L.J. Landsberg K.E. Gibson H.L. Kaslow D.C. Barr P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 55-65Google Scholar). Importantly, however, the protease domain of some SERA homologues, including SERPH, have no such substitutions. Very little is known about the function of the SERA proteins, and the fundamental reason for the requirement of so many homologues is unknown. In this paper, we analyze the expression of the eight chromosome 2 SERA genes using a combination of RT-PCR, microarray, antigenicity studies and gene “knockout” approaches. We also identify and similarly characterize a ninth SERAhomologue present on P. falciparum chromosome 9. These studies reveal that genes in the central region of the chromosome 2 cluster, but not those toward the periphery, are expressed in mature blood stage forms and appear to play an important role in maintenance of the erythrocytic cycle. P. falciparumparasites were cultured and synchronized as per standard procedures (27Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Google Scholar, 28Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Google Scholar). Enriched trophozoite and schizont preparations used in Western blot analysis were obtained by Percoll purification (29Fernandez V. Treutiger C.J. Nash G.B. Wahlgren M. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2969-2975Google Scholar). Ring stage parasites (∼5% parasitemia) were transfected with 80 μg of purified plasmid DNA (Plasmid Maxi Kit; Qiagen) as previously described (30Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7289-7294Google Scholar) except using modified electroporation conditions (31Fidock D.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10931-10936Google Scholar). Parasites were cultured in a 10-cm culture dish for 48 h prior to selection with 2.5 nm WR99210. Transfected parasites were visible after 3 weeks of continuous culture. Parasites containing integrated forms of the plasmid were obtained by drug cycling, where drug was removed for 2–3 weeks before being reapplied. The presumptive sequence of SERA proteins encoded in genomic fragments ofPlasmodium chabaudi, Plasmodium knowlesi, andPlasmodium yoelii was determined with the help of a program that was trained for ab initio gene prediction in P. falciparum and additionally uses an informant protein sequence 3M. Delorenzi, unpublished results. and by manually checking the quality of the resulting multiple alignment. The sequence of SERA6 was used as the informant sequence. The protease domain always resides entirely in the longest and terminal exon of the predicted genes, and its well conserved sequence could therefore be determined with high confidence. All the predicted genes also possess the strongly conserved terminal cysteine-rich block, which is characteristic for the SERA class of proteases, within the same exon. Multiple alignments were performed with the ClustalW program (32Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar) using default parameters. The sequence was subdivided into regions representing the blocks of strong conservation and the poorly aligned spacers between these blocks. Pairwise identity in a region was computed by realigning the two subsequences using the Smith-Waterman algorithm and averaging over all pairs. Oligonucleotide microarrays were printed on polylysine-coated microscope slides comprising 6912 P. falciparum 70-mer oligonucleotides, in duplicate (Operon Technologies). Highly synchronous parasite cultures were obtained by triple sorbitol treatment and used to measure SERA gene expression levels between mature (trophozoite/schizont) and young (ring) stage 3D7 parasites. Parasitized erythrocytes were lysed by saponin lysis, and the RNA was extracted using RNeasy minicolumns (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (20 μg) was reverse transcribed overnight using SuperScript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with a modification of the dNTP stock that resulted in final concentrations of 500 μm dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 250 μmdTTP and 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (Sigma; catalog no. A0410). The reactive amino group of 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP was used to conjugate 2 μg of the purified cDNA preparations with 100 μg of the fluorescent dye esters, NHS-Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences; catalog no. PA23001) and NHS-Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences; catalog no. PA25001). Microarrays were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with 500 ng of each fluorescently labeled probe in 25% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Arrays were washed twice at room temperature with 1× SSC, 0.2% SDS, followed by two stringent washes (0.1× SSC) prior to scanning on a ScanArray 4000 (GSI Lumonics). Data was extracted from the raw images using Spots 4M. J. Buckley (2000) CSIRO Mathematical and Information Services, New South Wales, Australia (available on the World Wide Web at www.cmis.csiro.au/iap/spot.htm). and mined in GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics). Genomic DNA was isolated from mixed trophozoite/schizont stage parasites as described (34Coppel R.L. Bianco A.E. Culvenor J.G. Crewther P.E. Brown G.V. Anders R.F. Kemp D.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 25: 73-81Google Scholar). Manipulation of recombinant DNA and analysis of nucleic acids by Southern blot hybridization were carried out using standard procedures (35$$Google Scholar). DNA was labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Bresatec DNA labeling kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using ProbeQuantTM G-50 Micro Columns (Amersham Biosciences). For RT-PCR, P. falciparumD10 total RNA was isolated from saponin-lysed (0.15% saponin) infected erythrocytes using the RNeasy minikit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed on the extracted RNA using the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen).SERA genes were amplified from the cDNA withTaq polymerase (Invitrogen) using the following oligonucleotides (restriction sites are underlined): SERA1/for (5′-AAACTCGAGTTGGATGAATTTAGTGATTC) and SERA1/rev (5′-CTAACTCGAGATCTACTAATGTTCCATTCG), SERA2/for (5′-AATCTCGAGCAATTGGAACCTCGATTTATG) and SERA2/rev (5′-CACTCGAGATCTGTCAGTATACCACTTAC), SERA3/for (5′-ATCTCGAGTATACGAAGAGAAATCTGC) and SERA3/rev (5′-TTCTCGAGCTACTTCATTTTTTAGATCTTACTC), SERA4/for (5′-ACTCGAGTTATCATCA GAATTAGCACCAC) and SERA4/rev (5′-TCTCGAGTGATCTTTCAGATCTCCATTC), SERA5/for (5′-GCTCGAGTACGGAGAAACAAAAGATACTAC) and SERA5/rev (5′-CTCTCGAGTTTAAGATCTAATCATCAAC), SERA6/for (5′-CCTCGAGCCTCACATCTTAATTTATGCC) and SERA6/rev (5′-TTCTCGAGTATCCATAGATCTACATTC), SERA7/for (5′-TCTCGAGTACAAGATAAGGATTCTAAAC) and SERA7/rev (5′-TCTCGAGAAGATCTAACATTCCACTTC), SERA8/for (5′-GGGACCTCGAGTTTACAAAAATGTATTTCATGTG) and SERA8/rev (5′-GGTTTCTAAATAGTACGAAAGATCTCCACCCTC), SERA9/for (5′-CTCATAGGATCCTTTTCCTTTTTTTCTTAATTTTATTCC) and SERA9/rev (5′-CTTTATTTTCTCGAGAAATAAAATTATAGCATAC), KAHRP/for (5′-ATGAAAAGTTTTAAGAACAAAAATACT) and KAHRP/rev (5′-CTGTTCCCTGGGGTTGTTGAGGTTG). The DNA sequences corresponding to the N-terminal regions of SERA1–9 genes were amplified from P. falciparum (D10) genomic DNA using the following oligonucleotides (restriction sites are underlined): SERA1N/for (5′-GTAATTCGTACAAGGGGGGGATCCGATG) and SERA1N/rev (5′-TTTAGACTCGAGATTATTGGGTGACCTTG), SERA2N/for (5′-ATAA AGAGTGGATCCACTACAGATGAATCTGC), and SERA 2N/rev (5′-GGTGATATCTTTGTTCCTCGAGATCCTCC), SERA3N/for (5′-GTCTTGTTTTGTAA AAATGACATAGAATTCACAAC) and SERA3N/rev (5′-CCACCATTGGTGAATTCTTTATTGG), SERA4N/for (5′-GGAGGTGATACAGAATTCCATCCAGGTACTCCTCC) and SERA 4N/rev (5′-GTAGATGAAGAATCGAATTCTCCTTGGGAACC), SERA5N/for (5′-GTTATATTTAACAAGGATCCTATAAAATCTACAGG) and SERA5N/rev (5′-GATTTTACTTGAATTCATCCTGTTTTTTC), SERA6N/for (5′-GTGACTGTGATATCACAGAATTCTGGACATAAC) and SERA6N/rev (5′-CAAATCATCGGAACGAATTCTTTTATTTGAAGG), SERA7N/for (5′-GGTGAGCAAGGAATTCCAAATTCACC) and SERA7N/rev (5′-GGAAGTGGAATTCGAGTTACAAGAGC), SERA8N/for (5′-GGGTTTACACGATTTTAGTAGGAATTCCGATG) and SERA8N/rev (5′-CCATTGATTAGAATTCTTTAAACATAAAGC), SERA9N/for (5′-CATCTGTTTCTGGATCCGTTGATTCTG) and SERA9N/rev (5′-ACCAACATTTTCTTTTAAAACTCGAGATTTAATTTAATCG). The resulting PCR products were ligated into the appropriate pGEX vectors and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells (Stratagene) as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (36Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were harvested by suspending bacteria expressing SERA proteins in 30 ml of Bug Buster™ (Novagen) in the presence of Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 30 min followed by sonication. The SERA proteins were purified from the supernatant using glutathione-Sepharose as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). GST alone was produced using the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. The GST fusion proteins and GST alone were dialyzed overnight in PBS before further use. To generate SERA antisera, 6-week-old female BALB/c mice and 3-month-old New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with 40 and 150 μg of SERA GST fusion proteins, respectively, in Freund's complete adjuvant. Animals were boosted three times with 35 and 120 μg of protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant 5 weeks post injection, after which the animals were bled for serum collection. Anti-GST antibodies were removed from rabbit serum using a GST-bound CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-SERA IgG fractions were further isolated by applying the rabbit serum to a Protein G-Sepharose column (AmershamBiosciences). Total IgG was eluted from the column with 0.1m glycine, 0.15 m NaCl (pH 2.6). Eluted fractions (2 ml) were neutralized using 200 μl of 2 mTris, pH 8.0. Parasite proteins obtained from enriched trophozoite and schizont preparations were separated on 6, 12, and 15% SDS-PAGE reducing gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with either rabbit anti-SERA1–9 polyclonal antibodies or pooled human sera derived from adults living in Papua New Guinea (denoted PNG-P, PNG-M, or PNG-B) (37O'Donnell R.A. de Koning-Ward T.F. Burt R.A. Bockarie M. Reeder J.C. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1403-1412Google Scholar). Melbourne serum was collected from nonmalaria exposed individuals currently living in Melbourne, Australia. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit or sheep anti-human IgG (Silenus Laboratories) were used for detection, and bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Smears of RBC infected withP. falciparum D10 late stage shizonts were fixed with ice-cold 100% methanol for 2 min and incubated with IgG-purified anti-rabbit SERA1 to -9 polyclonal antibodies and co-incubated with mouse anti-SERA5 antibody. Secondary antibodies were a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Silenus Laboratories) and rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako). Dual color fluorescence images were captured using a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. A search of theP. falciparum data base (available on the World Wide Web at www.PlasmodDB.org) revealed the presence of nine SERA gene homologues, eight in a cluster on chromosome 2 (24Gardner M.J. Tettelin H. Carucci D.J. Cummings L.M. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Shallom S. Mason T. Yu K. Fujii C. Pederson J. Shen K. Jing J. Aston C. Lai Z. Schwartz D.C. Pertea M. Salzberg S. Zhou L. Sutton G.G. Clayton R. White O. Smith H.O. Fraser C.M. Hoffman S.L. et al.Science. 1998; 282: 1126-1132Google Scholar) and one on chromosome 9 (Fig. 1). In this paper, these genes are referred to as SERA1–SERA9, withSERA5 and SERA6 being the previously describedSERA/SERP and SERPH genes, respectively (3Li W.B. Bzik D.J. Horii T. Inselburg J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 13-25Google Scholar, 38Knapp B. Hundt E. Enders B. Kupper H.A. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1991; 88: 147-156Google Scholar). Ironically, only SERA5 encodes an N-terminal serine stretch from which the family derives its name. All genes are predicted to possess the four-exon structure characteristic of SERA genes in this and other Plasmodium species with the exception ofSERA8, which is predicted to possess an additional exon and a premature stop codon. All SERA homologues encode a centrally located “papain-like” protease domain, although in SERA1–SERA5 and in SERA9 the active site cysteine residue is present as a serine. Phylogenetic analysis performed on all knownPlasmodium SERA genes reveals that SERA9 is most closely related to the other P. falciparum SERA genes with an “active site” serine. 5M. Delorenzi and B. S. Crabb, unpublished data.The origins and function of this “rouge” SERA gene remain to be determined; however, at present, there are no obvious features that distinguish this gene from SERA1–SERA5. RT-PCR analysis was used to determine which members of theSERA multigene family are expressed in parasitized erythrocytes. Initially, cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription of parasite RNA isolated from an asynchronous culture ofP. falciparum parasites (D10 line) using a poly(dT) primer. This material was subjected to PCR using primers specific for eachSERA gene amplifying across two introns as shown in Fig.1 B. The same primers were also used to amplify the genes from parasite gDNA. Appropriately sized gDNA and cDNA fragments were detected on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel (Fig.1 C). Sequencing of these PCR products confirmed the identification of the amplicons and of the intron/exon boundaries. It should be noted that although these fragments were sequenced for correct identification of each gene, rather than to identify polymorphisms, the sequence obtained from the D10 parasite line was almost identical to that published for 3D7 for each gene (24Gardner M.J. Tettelin H. Carucci D.J. Cummings L.M. Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Shallom S. Mason T. Yu K. Fujii C. Pederson J. Shen K. Jing J. Aston C. Lai Z. Schwartz D.C. Pertea M. Salzberg S. Zhou L. Sutton G.G. Clayton R. White O. Smith H.O. Fraser C.M. Hoffman S.L. et al.Science. 1998; 282: 1126-1132Google Scholar). These results indicate that each of the nine SERA genes is transcribed in blood stage parasites. In order to investigate the transcriptional regulation of the chromosome 2 SERA genes, parasite RNA isolated from the same number of synchronized ring, trophozoite, and schizont stage parasites (D10 line) was subjected to RT-PCR as described above. Appropriately sized cDNA fragments representing these eight SERA genes were detected in mature parasites but not in early stage parasites (Fig. 2). The presence ofSERA5 and SERA6 mRNA in mature blood stage forms of the parasite has previously been described (3Li W.B. Bzik D.J. Horii T. Inselburg J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 33: 13-25Google Scholar, 23Knapp B. Nau U. Hundt E. Kupper H.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 1-13Google Scholar, 10Fox B.A. Bzik D.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 133-144Google Scholar), consistent with the above results. Although not strictly quantitative, it appears from this experiment that maximal expression for each of the eight chromosome 2 SERA genes occurs in mature parasites. This is in contrast to the expression pattern for the KAHRPcontrol that is transcribed earlier in the parasite life cycle as expected. Note that since the SERA9 gene was not available until relatively recently, it was not included in this experiment. However, in a separate time course experiment, mRNA fromSERA9 appeared to be regulated similarly to the other SERAs (data not shown). To further examine SERA transcription, we used microarray analysis to measure the extent of increase in transcription ofSERA mRNA from young blood stage forms (rings) to mature forms (trophozoites/schizonts). By this analysis, only the centrally located SERA genes in the chromosome 2 cluster, as well asSERA9, showed a significant increase in expression in mature forms (Fig. 3 A). In addition,SERA5 appeared to be substantially more strongly transcribed than other SERA genes. A repeat set of microarray experiments in which the two mRNA samples were labeled with the alternate fluorescent dye revealed almost identical results (Fig.3 B). It should be noted that the microarray datum included here was part of a genome-wide expression analysis that revealed several “hot spots” of mRNA expression increase from young to mature forms. 6R. Good and A. Cowman, unpublished data. On chromosome 2, the SERA and MSP2/4/5(39Marshall V.M. Tieqiao W. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 13-25Google Scholar) loci were the most obvious in this regard. We aimed to generate antibodies specific for each of the SERA proteins. To identify variable regions suitable for recombinant protein expression, we aligned the amino acid sequences of the nine P. falciparum SERAs together with full-length SERA homologues identified in P. vivax (25Kiefer M.C. Crawford K.A. Boley L.J. Landsberg K.E. Gibson H.L. Kaslow D.C. Barr P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 55-65Google Scholar), P. knowlesi, and several rodent malaria species that we identified by interrogation of Plasmodium sequence data bases (available on the World Wide Web at www.PlasmoDB.org). Six highly conserved blocks were identified, five of which shared ∼45% amino acid identity across the family (Fig. 4). The remaining region (block 5) encompasses the protease-like domain and is even more conserved showing ∼60% identity. In contrast, a number of highly variable regions were identified, the most divergent of which is at the N terminus (Fig. 4, solid line). This region shares less than 10% identity between any two SERA proteins. Moreover, it is universally hydrophilic and, in the case of SERA5, has been shown to be immunogenic (14Pang X.L. Mitamura T. Horii T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1821-1827Google Scholar, 17Fox B.A. Xing-Li P. Suzue K. Horii T. Bzik D.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 121-134Google Scholar, 40Barr P.J. Inselburg J. Green K.M.

Hence, the N-terminal 50–100 residues of each P. falciparum SERA were expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein, and antiserum to each was raised in both rabbits and mice. To investigate the specificity of the rabbit antisera, each was tested for reactivity with a panel of SERA1–SERA9"

Although the function and the biophysical properties of the channel are now known, the regions of VR1 that recognize ligands are largely unknown. By the stepwise deletion of VR1 and by chimera construction using its capsaicin-insensitive homologue, VRL1, we localized key amino acids, Arg-114 and Glu-761, in the N- and C-cytosolic tails, respectively, that determine ligand binding. Point mutations of the two key residues resulted in a loss of sensitivity to capsaicin and a concomitant loss of specific binding to [3H]resiniferatoxin, a potent vanilloid. Furthermore, changes in the charges of the two amino acids blocked capsaicin-sensitive currents and ligand binding without affecting current responses to heat. Thus, these two regions in the cytoplasmic tails of VR1 provide structural elements for its hydrophilic interaction with vanilloids and might constitute a long-suspected binding pocket.

VR1 is a ligand-gated, cationic channel that is present mainly in small nociceptive sensory neurons (1Bevan S. Szolcsanyi J. Trends Pharmacol.

The presence of VR1 in sensory neurons leads to questions concerning the existence of endogenous capsaicin-like substances, and various lipid metabolic products of lipoxygenases or anandamide have been suggested as candidates, because they activate VR1 and are structurally similar to capsaicin (4Zygmunt P.M.

Accordingly, a role for lipoxygenase products in the activation of VR1 during inflammation was suggested (5Hwang S.W. Cho H. Kwak J. Lee S.-Y. Kang C.J. Jung J. Cho S. Min K.H. Suh Y.G. Kim D. Oh U.

Moreover, because ischemic or inflamed tissues become acidic, the acid activation of VR1 is a pathologically relevant event (13Caterina M.J. Julius D. Annu. Rev.

More direct evidence for the pathophysiological role of VR1 in the production of inflammatory pain came from knock-out experiments. In mice lacking VR1, thermal hyperalgesia evoked by inflammation is reduced (14Caterina M.J. Leffler A. Malmberg A.B. Martin W.J. Trafton J. Petersen-Zeitz K.R. Koltzenburg M. Basbaum A.I. Julius D.

Furthermore, hyperalgesia induced by the key inflammatory mediators, bradykinin and nerve growth factor, is reduced in mice lacking VR1 (8Chuang H.-H. Prescott E.D. Kong H. Shields S. Jordt S.-E.

Thus, VR1 is now considered a primary molecular transducer that mediates inflammatory hyperalgesia (13Caterina M.J. Julius D. Annu. Rev.

Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). VR1 appears to form a homotetramer when expressed heterologously (17Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D.

However, VR1 may form a heteromultimer with another temperature-sensitive channel, transient receptor potential V3 (18Smith G.D. Gunthorpe M.J. Kelsell R.E. Hayes P.D. Reilly P. Facer P. Wright J.E.

The cloning of VR1 resulted in the identification of many genes with sequence homology, for example, heat-sensitive vanilloid receptor-like (VRL1) channel and osmotically activated channel (VR-OAC) (19Caterina M.J. Rosen T.A. Tominaga M. Brake A.J. Julius D. Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar, 20Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A. Hudspeth A.J.

In addition, splicing variants of VR1, such as stretch-inhibitable channel (SIC) and VR.5′sv, were also identified (21Suzuki M. Sato J. Kutsuwada K. Ooki G. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6330-6335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 22Schumacher M.A. Moff I. Sudanagunta S.P. Levine J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2756-2762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interestingly, none of these homologues respond to capsaicin when expressed heterologously. Capsaicin,N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-8-methylnon-6-enamide, is known to have three functional regions, i.e. a homovanillic acid, an amide bond, and an aliphatic chain, which are often referred to as the A, B, and C regions, respectively (23Walpole C.S. Wrigglesworth R. Wood J.N. Capsaicin in the Study of Pain. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 63-82Google Scholar). The homovanillyl motif and amide bond regions contain dipolar groups, such as hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, which are implicated in hydrogen bonding interactions. Analyses of the structure-activity relationship of numerous capsaicin analogues suggest that these polar regions in capsaicin analogs are essential for maintaining pungency, which could be alternatively expressed as maintaining the excitation of sensory neurons (23Walpole C.S. Wrigglesworth R. Wood J.N. Capsaicin in the Study of Pain. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 63-82Google Scholar, 24Szolcsanyi J. Jancso-Garbor A. Arzneim.

In contrast, the aliphatic chain in the C region, which has an optimal chain length of 8–10 carbon atoms, is presumed to interact hydrophobically with its receptors. Although a receptor model has been suggested based on the structure-activity relationships of the capsaicin analogs, structural elements in VR1 that confer specific interactions with vanilloids have not been characterized. Recently, a region spanning the third transmembrane domain (TM3) in VR1 was found to be essential for ligand binding, presumably by hydrophobic interaction with capsaicin (27Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). However, regions in VR1 that determine its binding to ligands, with an emphasis on hydrophilic interactions, have not been resolved. Moreover, unlike other ligand-gated channels that produce fast synaptic transmission, vanilloids are known to act on the capsaicin receptor from the intracellular side (27Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 28Jung J. Hwang S.W. Kwak J. Lee S.-Y. Kang C.J. Kim W.B. Kim D. Oh U. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Welch J.M. Simon S.A. Reinhart P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13889-13894Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This suggests that certain regions in the cytosolic tails of VR1 are targeted as ligand recognition sites. Because of the innate implication of the involvement of cytosolic tails in ligand binding, we constructed VR1/VRL1 chimeras and performed a series of deletions and site-directed mutagenesis at the N and C termini of VR1 to localize amino acid residues in each cytosolic tail that appeared critical for ligand binding. A cDNA clone encoding an open reading frame of VR1 was isolated from the dorsal root ganglion neurons of adult rats, as described previously (28Jung J. Hwang S.W. Kwak J. Lee S.-Y. Kang C.J. Kim W.B. Kim D. Oh U. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A VRL1 cDNA was a generous gift from D. Julius of the University of California, San Francisco. The cDNA of wild-type VR1 and its various mutants were inserted into pSDTF (a generous gift from T. P. Snutch of British Columbia University) and pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) to obtain expression in oocytes and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells, respectively. VR1/VRL1 chimeras were constructed by recombinant PCR. The deletion mutants of VR1 from either N- or C-terminal cytoplasmic domains were produced by PCR. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a combination of two overlapping PCR fragments, which were constructed from mutagenic primers (30Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stokton, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar). The incorporation of engineered mutations and the fidelity of the PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cDNAs were linearized with XbaI. Capped mRNAs were synthesized using an SP6 RNA polymerase in an Ambion Megascript kit, as described by the manufacturer. Expressions in oocytes of all mutants of VR1 or VR1/VRL1 chimeras were confirmed by immunoblots. VR1 and its mutants were expressed inXenopus oocytes as described previously (28Jung J. Hwang S.W. Kwak J. Lee S.-Y. Kang C.J. Kim W.B. Kim D. Oh U. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, stage V-VI oocytes from Xenopus laevis were defolliculated with type A collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and microinjected with 5–25 ng of the cRNAs of wild-type VR1, mutant VR1s, or VR1/VRL1 chimeras in 50 nl of diethylene pyrocarbonate-treated water. 2 to 4 days after the microinjection, capsaicin-sensitive currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. The membrane potential was held at −60 mV, and the recording solution contained the following (in mm): 96 NaCl, 5 HEPES, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, and 1 MgCl2 (pH 7.5). All experiments were performed at room temperature. Wild-type VR1 and its mutant cDNAs subcloned in pCDNA3 were transfected into HEK 293T cells using a LipofectAMINE PLUS kit (Invitrogen). 24 to 48 h after transfection, transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and stored at −70 °C until assayed. The binding assay was carried out in 96-well filtration plates (31Acs G. Lee J. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain. Res. 1996; 35: 173-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Multiscreen separation system; Millipore) fitted with polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters (pore size = 0.45 μm; Durapore). 1 × 105 cells were then loaded into wells that had been washed with assay buffer containing the following (in mm): 5 KCl, 5.8 NaCl, 0.75 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 320 sucrose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Cohn fraction V; Sigma). Cells were incubated with [3H]RTX (30–1,000 pm) in a total reaction volume of 150 μl for 1 h, with gentle shaking at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding was defined as [3H]RTX binding in the presence of 1 μm non-radioactive RTX (32Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Brain Res. 1990; 524: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,33Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Annicelli L.L. Krause J.E. Cortright D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). After 1 h, the microplate was chilled on ice, and prechilled α1-acid glycoprotein (1 mg/well; Sigma) in 50 μl of assay buffer was added to each well to reduce nonspecific binding (33Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Annicelli L.L. Krause J.E. Cortright D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar,34Szallasi A. Lewin N.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 262: 883-888PubMed Google Scholar). The solution in the microplates was then aspirated immediately, and the microplate filter membranes were washed with a buffer containing 100 μg of α1-acid glycoprotein, dried completely, and collected for liquid scintillation counting. The binding data were calculated using the Hill equation,B = (B max ×L Hn)/(K Dn+ L Hn), whereB represents the concentration of receptor-ligand complex,B max is the maximal binding capacity,L H is the concentration of radioactive free ligand, K D is the concentration of [3H]RTX when half of the receptors are occupied, andn is the Hill coefficient. Lysates of the oocytes injected with the cRNAs of the wild-type or mutant VR1s were obtained by centrifuging at 1,000 × g for 10 min after homogenizing the cells in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE after incubation for 10 min at 55 °C. Electroblotted membranes were incubated with antiserum raised against the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of VR1 (NVR1) or with antiserum against the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of VR1 (CVR1), as described previously (35Shin J.S. Wang M.-H. Hwang S.W. Cho H. Cho S.Y. Kwon M.J. Lee S.-Y. Oh U. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 299: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) were used for the visualization. HEK 293T cells transfected with VR1 and its mutants were seeded on a cover glass coated with poly-l-lysine. After incubation for 24 h, cells were washed briefly three times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin and fixed for 10 min in PBS containing 10% formaldehyde at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, and rewashed. The cells were then rinsed with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, to block the nonspecific binding of proteins other than antibodies, and incubated with polyclonal anti-NVR1 or -CVR1 antiserum (1:1000 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit antimouse IgG (1:100 dilution; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h, rewashed extensively, and incubated with propidium iodide (Sigma) for nuclear staining. Cells expressing VR1 and its mutants were viewed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS; Wetzlar, Germany). [3H]RTX (48.0 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, non-radioactive RTX was fromBiomol Research Laboratories, Inc., and capsaicin and capsazepine were from Research Biochemicals, Inc. (Natick, MA). Reagents used in cell culture were purchased from Invitrogen, and all the other reagents were from Sigma, unless indicated otherwise. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Multiple comparisons of means were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test. The Student'st test was used to compare two means. p values smaller than 0.05 were considered significant. The issue of the requirement of cytosolic tails for ligand binding was addressed by constructing a series of chimeras between VR1 and a capsaicin-insensitive VR1 homologue, VRL1. When 1 μm capsaicin was applied toXenopus oocytes, those expressing wild-type VR1 exhibited large inward currents (Icap) at a holding potential of −60 mV, which were blocked by 10 μmcapsazepine, a competitive antagonist of the capsaicin receptor (2Oh U. Hwang S.W. Kim D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Bevan S. Hothi S. Hughes G. James I.F. Rang H.P. Shah K. Walpole C.S.J. Yeats J.C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 544-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). VRL1 expressed in oocytes did not respond to capsaicin. Chimeras (chimeras c and d) constructed with the VRL1 backbone but containing either the N or C terminus of VR1, failed to exhibit Icap, suggesting the possible role of the two cytosolic regions in capsaicin activation. When both cytosolic tails of VR1 were substituted for the corresponding segments of VRL1, the chimera (chimera e) still did not respond to capsaicin. The lack of activation by capsaicin in chimera e could have been because of the lack of the VR1 functional TM3, which is implicated in hydrophobic interaction with vanilloids (27Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Indeed, when the TM3 region of VR1 was added, the VR1/VRL1 chimeras (chimerasf and g) elicited Icap. In contrast, when either TM3 or the two cytosolic tails of VR1 were replaced by cognate segments of VRL1, the chimeras produced (chimerash, i, and j) failed to showIcap, even in the presence of maximal concentration (20 μm) of capsaicin. These results indicate that certain regions in the N and C termini of VR1 are required, in addition to the TM3 regions for VR1 activation by capsaicin. To localize regions in the cytosolic tails that confer capsaicin sensitivity, a series of deletion mutants of the N terminus of VR1 were constructed (Fig.2 A). When 1 μmcapsaicin was applied, oocytes expressing VR1 mutants deleted up to Asp-113, such as Δ1–35, Δ1–109, and Δ1–113, produced Icap comparable with that of wild-type VR1 (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, current responses were completely absent in oocytes expressing a series of VR1 deletion mutants that omitted Arg-114, namely Δ1–114, Δ1–115, Δ1–116, Δ1–117, Δ1–118, Δ1–119, Δ1–151, Δ1–199, and Δ1–432. Moreover, the insensitivity to capsaicin of the VR1 deletion mutants lacking Arg-114 was not because of the lack of mutant expression in oocytes. All mutants were found to be expressed properly to the same extent as wild-type VR1 when probed by immunoblots with a mouse antiserum raised against a segment of the C terminus, VR1 (684–838) (Fig. 2 D). When transfected to HEK 293T cells, the Δ1–114 mutant showed immunoreactivity in the cell membrane and in the cytosol, an expression pattern similar to that of the wild-type VR1 (Fig. 2 D), and which, in part, indicates membrane targeting. These results indicate that the region close to Arg-114 is essential for channel activation by capsaicin. Although Arg-114 and the vicinity of Arg-114 in the N terminus appear to be critical for activating VR1, studies on VR1/VRL1 chimeras (particularly chimera i in Fig. 1) indicate that a certain region in the C terminus of VR1 is also implicated in activation by vanilloids. Thus, we constructed a series of deletion mutants that lacked portions of the peptide sequence in the C terminus (Fig.3 A). When expressed in oocytes, deletion mutants up to Asp-765, such as Δ823–838, Δ787–838, Δ766–838, and Δ765–838, elicited anIcap that was comparable with that of the wild-type VR1 (Fig. 3, B and C). When deletion was proceeded further to the vicinity of Glu-761 to produce VR1 mutants such as Δ764–838, Δ763–838, and Δ762–838, Icap was reduced significantly compared with that of the wild-type. When deletion proceeded beyond Glu-761, to produce Δ761–838, Δ732–838, and Δ684–838, Icap was undetectable (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, mutants Δ761–838and Δ762–838 were found to be expressed properly at ∼85 kDa, at levels comparable with that of the wild-type when immunostained with polyclonal antibody raised against a protein segment in the N terminus, VR1 (1–432) (Fig. 3 D). Moreover, HEK 293T cells transfected with the Δ761–838 mutant showed immunoreactivity in the cell membrane and in the cytosol, which was similar to that of wild-type VR1 (Fig. 3 D). These results suggest that Glu-761 and its vicinity in the C terminus are necessary for the activation of VR1 by capsaicin. The ability of deletion mutants to bind [3H]RTX, a potent agonist of the capsaicin receptor, was examined (32Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Brain Res. 1990; 524: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, [3H]RTX displayed a saturable binding to HEK-VR1 cells. As reported previously (33Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Annicelli L.L. Krause J.E. Cortright D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), half-maximal binding (K D) occurred at 98.0 ± 3.5 pm [3H]RTX (mean ± S.E., triple determinations, n = 3). AtK D, nonspecific binding reached ∼12% of the total binding. The Hill coefficient (n) was 1.6 ± 0.04, indicating a positive cooperativity (33Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Annicelli L.L. Krause J.E. Cortright D.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Maximal specific binding (B max) was 211.2 ± 8.4 fmol/106 cells. An N terminus deletion mutant, Δ1–109, that elicitedIcap retained specific binding for [3H]RTX with a K D of 258.1 ± 8.3 pm (mean ± range, triple determinations). In contrast, cells expressing Δ1–114, which failed to showIcap, completely lost specific binding to [3H]RTX (triple determinations, n = 2; see Fig. 4 B). Similarly, deletion mutants at the C terminus, such as Δ762–838 and Δ763–838, which displayed smaller Icap, bound [3H]RTX with K D values of 382.7 ± 11.2 pm (triple preparations, n = 3) and 115.7 ± 43.0 pm (triple determinations,n = 4), respectively. In contrast, Δ761–838, which failed to elicitIcap, had no ability to specifically bind [3H]RTX (triple determinations, n = 2; see Fig. 4 C). Thus, deletion mutants that lacked one of these two regions lost current sensitivity to capsaicin and the ability to bind ligands. These results suggest that the two regions in the vicinity of Arg-114 and Glu-761 are critical for ligand binding and that the loss of these regions abrogates vanilloid activation. To determine further whether the two residues, Arg-114 and Glu-761, are required to bind vanilloids, we constructed VR1 mutants that lacked only the single amino acids i.e. Arg-114 (Δ114) or Glu-761 (Δ761) (Fig.5 A). Our results showed that a deletion as small as a single amino acid affects the ligand binding. As shown in Fig. 5 B, Δ114 and Δ761failed to elicit capsaicin-sensitive inward currents. Furthermore, the mutants did not show specific binding to [3H]RTX (Fig.5 C). Because VR1 is activated by acid and heat (3Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6979) Google Scholar, 12Tominaga M. Caterina M.J. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilbert H. Skinner K. Raumann B.E. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar), these mutants were also tested for acid and heat sensitivity in transfected HEK cells. As shown in Fig. 5 D, both mutants elicited whole-cell currents when activated by heat at ∼46 °C, but both mutants failed to respond to acid (pH 5.5). HEK cells transfected with the wild-type VR1 elicited a sustained current response to acid (pH 5.5) and rapid activating and inactivating currents. Moreover, HEK cells transfected with Δ114 and Δ761 also elicited rapid activating and inactivating currents, which are presumably mediated by native acid-sensing ion channels in HEK cells, because similar acid-sensitive currents were observed in non-transfected HEK cells (37Gunthorpe M.J. Smith G.D. Davis J.B. Randall A.D. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 442: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These results further confirm that the Arg-114 and the Glu-761 regions are critical for ligand binding. Because the Arg-114 and Glu-761 residues are charged, it is likely that these charges are necessary for vanilloid binding. We thus constructed VR1 mutants with opposite charges but similar side chain lengths at Arg-114 or Glu-761. As shown in Fig.6 A, when positively charged arginine at 114 was replaced by a neutral amino acid, alanine, the mutant (R114A) elicited an Icap comparable with that of the wild-type VR1. However, when the arginine at 114 was replaced by negatively charged glutamate (R114E), a significant reduction (96.9 ± 0.5% reduction, p < 0.0001,n = 13) in Icap was observed with no apparent specific [3H]RTX binding (Fig. 6,A and B). Because the adjacent amino acid, Arg-115, is also positively charged, we replaced it with aspartate (R115D). The R115D mutant also abolished the capsaicin-sensitive currents (p < 0.001, n = 6), indicating that charge at Arg-115 contributes equally to activation by capsaicin (data not shown). Similarly, when the negatively charged glutamate at 761 was changed to glutamine, a neutral amino acid that retains a similar structure, the mutant (E761Q) elicited a great reduction inIcap (98.0 ± 0.3% reduction,p < 0.0001, n = 10) and had no specific binding for [3H]RTX (Fig. 6, A andB). Furthermore, when the glutamate at 761 was substituted with positively charged lysine, the mutant (E761K) showed no current response to capsaicin and ability to bind [3H]RTX (Fig.6, A and B). R114E and E761K elicited current responses to heat but not to acid (pH 5.5) (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate that the negative charge of glutamate at 761 is necessary for ligand recognition and that the positive charge at Arg-114 determines ligand binding to the channel but to a lesser extent than the charge at Glu-761. VR1 is a molecular sensor present in small sensory neurons and is believed to be responsible for detecting various noxious stimuli. However, despite its physiological significance, the activation mechanisms of VR1 remain unknown. It has been reported that capsaicin and its analogs act on the intracellular side of the channel, suggesting the presence of ligand binding sites in the intracellular channel domains (28Jung J. Hwang S.W. Kwak J. Lee S.-Y. Kang C.J. Kim W.B. Kim D. Oh U. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, the present study identified two regions near Arg-114 and Glu-761 in the cytosolic tails of VR1 that determine ligand binding. These areas seemed to be minimal marginal sites required for channel activation, because truncation or point mutation of these regions causes a loss of capsaicin sensitivity and concomitant loss of [3H]RTX binding capacity. Charges carried by the amino acids in the two regions appear to be minimal determinants of binding, because the introduction of neutral or oppositely charged residues at these positions causes a substantial to complete loss of ligand binding capacity. Based on the structure-activity relationships of synthetic capsaicin analogues (24Szolcsanyi J. Jancso-Garbor A. Arzneim. Forsch. 1975; 25: 1877-1881PubMed Google Scholar,25Walpole C.S. Wrigglesworth R. Bevan S. Campbell E.A. Dray A. James I.F. Masdin K.J. Perkins M.N. Winter J. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 2373-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it appears that the dipolar properties of phenolic hydroxide and of the amide group in capsaicin are important for its pharmacologic effects. In accordance with this proposition, it is highly conceivable that the charged residues at Glu-761, and at Arg-114 to a lesser extent, provide a hydrophilic interaction with capsaicin. Thus, in addition to the TM3 region in VR1, which is implicated in the hydrophobic interaction (27Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), the two areas in the cytosolic tails also constitute a part of the capsaicin binding pocket, as has been proposed by others (26Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 159-212PubMed Google Scholar). Although the present study suggests that regions near the Arg-114 and Glu-761 residues in VR1 are key determinants of agonist binding, we cannot rule out the possibility that other regions of VR1 are also required to form a functional ligand binding pocket. Indeed, Jordt and Julius (27Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) found that the TM3 region is also necessary for ligand binding, and this was confirmed by the present study (Fig. 1). Because the transmembrane domain region is embedded in a hydrophobic environment, the transmembrane region is believed to imply a hydrophobic interaction with VR1 (27Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations of the sixth transmembrane domain were found to reduce [3H]RTX binding affinity (38Kuzhikandathil E.V. Wang H. Szabo T. Morozova N. Blumberg P.M. Oxford G.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8697-8706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that there are regions other than the two loci in the cytosolic tails or the third transmembrane domain that control VR1 ligand binding. Because we approached the sensitive areas by deleting segments of VR1 from N or C terminus, the presence of additional regions in the cytosolic tails located beyond Arg-114 and Glu-761 is also possible. More precise details of the ligand recognition sites, required for ligand binding, could be obtained by analyzing VR1 structurally. Birds are not sensitive to vanilloids and can be fed hot chili peppers (26Szallasi A. Blumberg P.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 159-212PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, avian VR1 is insensitive to capsaicin (27Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). One plausible reason for the lack of capsaicin sensitivity of chick VR1 is that chick VR1 is equipped with a TM3 region that is not functional for capsaicin binding. When the TM3 region of chick VR1 is replaced with the cognate segment of rat VR1, the chick/rat VR1 chimera shows a sensitivity to capsaicin (27Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). This raises a question about the presence of the putative ligand recognition sites in the cytosolic tails in chick VR1. Indeed, chick VR1 has almost the same sequences in the putative ligand recognition sites as rat VR1 (see Fig.2 A and Fig. 3 A). Therefore, chick VR1 appears to have a rudimentary backbone for vanilloid binding and elicits a rudimentary response to high doses of capsaicin (27Jordt S.-E. Julius D. Cell. 2002; 108: 421-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). However, chick VR1 lacks only the functional TM3 region among the three minimal recognition sites. In contrast, VRL1, a capsaicin-insensitive homologue of VR1 with a relatively low sequence homology, failed to show current response to capsaicin even when a large segment of the transmembrane domain of VR1, including the TM3 region, was replaced (chimeraj in Fig. 1). This is, in part, because VRL1 does not have functional ligand binding sites in the cytosolic tails. A VR1/VRL1 chimera is capsaicin-sensitive only when segments of VR1 containing the ligand binding regions in cytosolic tails and the TM3 regions are present. Thus, these results, together with those obtained using chick VR1, indicate that the putative ligand binding sites in the cytosolic tails are required for capsaicin sensitivity. The activation of ligand-gated channels by ligands often requires interactions with several separate regions in the channel complexes. For example, the binding of glutamate to theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor requires interaction between two extracellular domains, an extracellular region preceding the M1 transmembrane segment and an extracellular loop between the M3 and M4 segments (39Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In contrast, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor forms several distinct regions in the extracellular domains of its α- and non-α-subunits for ligand binding (40Corringer P.-J., Le Novere N.L. Changeux J.-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). In the present study, interaction between ligands and both regions in the N- and C-cytosolic tails appears to be obligatory for agonist binding, because the deletion of either of these two regions abrogates [3H]RTX binding. The functional form of VR1 appears to be a homotetramer (17Kedei N. Szabo T. Lile J.D. Treanor J.J. Olah Z. Iadarola M.J. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28613-28619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, vanilloids interact with the two putative regions within or between subunits of the VR1 channel complex when it is activated by capsaicin. To determine the nature of the possible receptor ligand interaction that occurs within or between VR1 subunits, we co-expressed two VR1 mutants, Δ1–114and Δ761–838, each of which failed to respond to capsaicin when expressed alone. However, the co-expression of these two mutants failed to elicit Icap or [3H]RTX binding (data not shown). Because the two mutants contained each of the two obligatory regions, the failure of the co-expressed mutants to activate Icap suggests that vanilloids interact with the two terminal regions of one VR1 subunit. One striking feature of VR1 is its activation by heat and acid (3Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6979) Google Scholar, 12Tominaga M. Caterina M.J. Malmberg A.B. Rosen T.A. Gilbert H. Skinner K. Raumann B.E. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). Moreover, VR1 activation has clinical implications, because ischemia or inflammation causes acidosis in tissues. In the present study, VR1 mutants, such as Δ114, Δ761, R114E, or E761K, lost their ability to produce capsaicin-sensitive currents but retained heat sensitivity (see Fig. 5 D and Fig.6 C). These results indicate that the two regions in each cytosolic tail probably do not confer sensitivity to heat. Consistent with this, VRL1 is activated by heat but not by capsaicin. Therefore, activation mechanisms by heat and vanilloids appear distinct. Evidence now available suggests that the activation of VR1 by acid or capsaicin is mediated by distinct molecular mechanisms. The activation of VR1 by acid occurs only when the stimulus is applied to the extracellular surface of the channel, whereas activation by vanilloids occurs when from the intracellular side (12Tominaga M.

Neurosci. 1999; 19: 529-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations at charged residues on the extracellular surface or at a pore region of VR1 display reduced responses to acid as compared with capsaicin (29Welch J.M. Simon S.A. Reinhart P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13889-13894Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 41Jordt S-E. Tominaga M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8134-8139Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, deletion or disruption of the two sites in the cytosolic tails of VR1 dissipated capsaicin-sensitive currents and acid-gated responses (see Fig. 5 D and Fig. 6 C). Thus, unlike portions of the extracellular surface of VR1, these cytosolic regions appear to be linked functionally to the activation of VR1 by acid and by vanilloids. In summary, in this study we identified minimal marginal regions in the cytosolic tails of VR1 that control its binding to ligands. Because the charges of the two amino acids in these regions appear critical to ligand binding, it is likely that these two obligatory sites share hydrophilic interaction with vanilloids. Thus, we believe that the present study provides the molecular elements of VR1 required for ligand binding. However, we cannot exclude the possible role of the intracellular domains in controlling folding or stabilization of the channel complex. The precise nature of the molecular interactions between VR1 and vanilloids should be determined by the structural analysis of VR1."
https://openalex.org/W2143538540,"We have isolated a highly potent neurotoxin from the venom of the Chinese bird spider, Selenocosmia huwena. This 4.1-kDa toxin, which has been named huwentoxin-IV, contains 35 residues with three disulfide bridges: Cys-2-Cys-17, Cys-9-Cys-24, and Cys-16-Cys-31, assigned by a chemical strategy including partial reduction of the toxin and sequence analysis of the modified intermediates. It specifically inhibits the neuronal tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) voltage-gated sodium channel with the IC(50) value of 30 nm in adult rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, while having no significant effect on the tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) voltage-gated sodium channel. This toxin seems to be a site I toxin affecting the sodium channel through a mechanism quite similar to that of TTX: it suppresses the peak sodium current without altering the activation or inactivation kinetics. The three-dimensional structure of huwentoxin-IV has been determined by two-dimensional (1)H NMR combined with distant geometry and simulated annealing calculation by using 527 nuclear Overhauser effect constraints and 14 dihedral constraints. The resulting structure is composed of a double-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet (Leu-22-Ser-25 and Trp-30-Tyr-33) and four turns (Glu-4-Lys-7, Pro-11-Asp-14, Lys-18-Lys-21 and Arg-26-Arg-29) and belongs to the inhibitor cystine knot structural family. After comparison with other toxins purified from the same species, we are convinced that the positively charged residues of loop IV (residues 25-29), especially residue Arg-26, must be crucial to its binding to the neuronal tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel."

APP undergoes extensive proteolytic processing along two major pathways. APP can be cleaved extracellularly by the α-secretase creating a C83 membrane-bound intermediate, which is subsequently cleaved by the γ-secretase releasing a non-amyloidogenic fragment termed p3. Alternatively, APP can be cleaved extracellularly by the β-secretase forming a C99 membrane-bound intermediate, which is subsequently cleaved by the γ-secretase releasing the amyloidogenic Aβ fragment. Aβ is the major component of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with AD and is considered to be the major underlying cause of the disease. An additional peptide termed AID, extending from the γ-secretase cleavage site to the carboxyl terminus of APP, is also produced following γ-secretase cleavage regardless of whether it was preceded by α or β cleavage. This AID peptide was first identified in the brains of patients with AD and normal controls, and was shown to either induce or sensitize cells to apoptosis (7Passer B. Pellegrini L. Russo C.

Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar) by the γ-secretase, so does APP. Much less is known about APLP1 and APLP2, the two other APP family members. The human APLP1 gene is located on chromosome 19q13.1 (14Lenkkeri U. Kestila M. Lamerdin J. McCready P. Adamson A. Olsen A. Tryggvason K. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and APLP2 is located on chromosome 11q23-q25 (15von der Kammer H. Loffler C. Hanes J. Klaudiny J. Scheit K.H. Hansmann I. Genomics. 1994; 20: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although no clear neuronal functions have been found for these molecules, APLP1 has been implicated in synaptogenesis (16Kim T.W., Wu, K., Xu, J.L. McAuliffe G. Tanzi R.E. Wasco W. Black I.B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and recombinant APLP2 possess the ability to promote neurite outgrowth (17Cappai R. Mok S.S. Galatis D. Tucker D.F. Henry A. Beyreuther K. Small D.H. Masters C.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that the APLPs undergo processing in the ectodomain. Secretory APLP1 consisting of the APLP1 extracellular domain has been detected in human cerebrospinal fluid and in the conditioned media of cells overexpressing APLP1 (2Paliga K. Peraus G Kreger S.

APLP2 also sheds it extracellular domain in multiple cell culture systems (18Xu K.P. Zoukhri D. Zieske J.D. Dartt D.A. Sergheraert C. Loing E. Yu F.S. Am. J. Physiol.

Still, the significance of these cleavages are unknown. Work using knockout mice has revealed an aspect of the relationships between the various APP family members. Single disruptions of APP, APLP1, or APLP2 cause minor abnormalities, which are distinct for the different family members (23von Koch C.S. Zheng H. Chen H. Trumbauer M.

Some of the differences in phenotype are probably related to the expression of APLP1 being restricted mostly to the nervous system (14Lenkkeri U. Kestila M. Lamerdin J. McCready P. Adamson A. Olsen A. Tryggvason K. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although mice with both APP and APLP1-disrupted are normal, APP plus APLP2 or APLP1 plus APLP2 double knockout mice die soon after birth (24Heber S. Herms J. Gajic V. Hainfellner J. Aguzzi A. Rulicke T. von Kretzschmar H. von Koch C. Sisodia S. Tremml P. Lipp H.P. Wolfer D.P. Muller U. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7951-7963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that although there are unique roles for each of the different APP family members during development, there is also functional redundancy among them that allows compensation in single knockout mice. To gain more insight into the APP family, we sought to identify aspects of the APLPs that are similar to or different from APP. In this report we show that APLP1 and APLP2 are substrates of the γ-secretase and are processed to release ALID1 and ALID2. This processing is also shown to be Presenilin 1 (PS1)-dependent. We further show that the carboxyl terminal fragments of the APLPs bind Fe65 and may function in combination with Fe65 to activate gene expression. Finally, we show that full-length APLPs restrict Fe65 from entering the nucleus prior to γ-secretase processing. Gal4-APP and Gal4-APPCT44 constructs were obtained from Dr. Thomas Sudhof.

When the first tyrosine of the conserved YENPTY motif is mutated (Y-G), activation is almost completely abolished. Note that the activation values are greater than in Fig. 2 e because untagged Fe65 causes greater activation than Fe65 fused to YFP. b, lysates from 293 cells overexpressing FLAG-Fe65 were incubated with Sepharose beads bound to GST alone (−), the terminal 57 amino acids of APP (AID) or the terminal 57 amino acids of APLP1/2 wild type (ALID1/2 w.t.), or with the first tyrosine of the conserved YENPTY motif mutated to glycine (ALID1/2 Y-G).

Roncarati R. Vito P. Lopez P.A. Abdallah M. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3767-3775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). APP specific antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and APLP1 and APLP2 antibodies were fromCalbiochem. Antibody B10, which cross-reacts with all APP family members and the PS1 carboxyl-terminal antibody was a gift of Dr. Bart De Strooper. Recombinant GST-fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL21 (Stratagene) using the pGEX system (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were incubated with 293 cell lysates containing FLAG-Fe65 for 1 h at room temperature. Following five washes the beads were boiled with loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Pulled down protein was detected by Western blotting with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 such that the ratio of APP/APLP1/APLP2 to YFP/GFP-Fe65 was 4:1. The Gal4BD epitope was detected with anti-Gal4BD monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) and Cy5-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Endogenous APLP1 and APLP2 were detected using an antibody dilution of 1:2500. Overexpressed wild type APLP1 and APLP2 were detected with an antibody dilution of 1:10,000. Secondary antibody Alexa-594 conjugated to goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used at a dilution of 1:250. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Sigma). Images were captured using a charge-coupled device camera mounted on an Olympus Provis AX70. Since APP signals by releasing the biologically active AID peptide, we sought to investigate whether APLP1 and APLP2 also release biologically active ALIDs due to processing by the γ-secretase. HEK293 and N2a neuroblastoma cells were incubated either in the absence or presence of the γ-secretase inhibitors Compound E or DAPT. Western blotting using antibodies specific for the carboxyl termini of APP, APLP1, or APLP2 showed that just as APP produces C83 and C99 intermediates, APLP1 and APLP2 also produce C83/C99-like intermediates that accumulate when the γ-secretase activity is inhibited (Fig.1 a). This suggested that APLP1 and APLP2 are substrates of the γ-secretase. It is important to note that we did not detect the endogenous ALID peptides, perhaps because they are unstable and have a short half-life similar to the AID peptide (28Cupers P. Orlans I. Craessaerts K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1168-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We next wanted to determine whether this γ-secretase processing of APLP1 and APLP2 is PS1- dependent. Fig. 1 bshows that in brain lysates from PS1 knockout mice there is accumulation of intermediates of APP, APLP1, and APLP2 processing but not in the lysates from wild type controls. These data indicate that all three members of the APP family are processed by the γ-secretase in a PS1- dependent manner. In the recent report by Cao and Sudhof (9Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), a Gal4BD (binding domain) fusion protein reporter system was used to show that following γ-secretase cleavage of APP, a multimolecular complex consisting of AID, Fe65, and Tip60 forms in the nucleus to cause reporter gene activation. Once we found that APLP1 and APLP2 also release fragments via the γ-secretase, we sought to determine whether APLP1 and APLP2 may also have a role in gene activation. Full-length constructs of APP, APLP1, and APLP2 with the Gal4BD inserted into the cytoplasmic domain (Fig.2 a) were co-transfected with a Gal4-luciferase reporter construct with or without Fe65. Fig.2 b shows that in two cell lines all the APP family members cause transcriptional activation of the reporter gene with an Fe65 dependence. We next wanted to determine whether this activation was due to release of an active fragment by the γ-secretase. Performance of a similar assay with and without γ-secretase inhibitors revealed (Fig.2 c) that reporter gene activation is indeed inhibited by γ-secretase inhibitors. Furthermore, to establish that APLP processing is PS1-dependent, reporter gene assays were carried out with co-transfection of the dominant negative PS1 mutant D385A. This aspartate mutation has been shown to replace endogenous Presenilins and abolish Presenilin-dependent γ-secretase activity (29Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar, 30Kim S.H. Leem J.Y. Lah J.J. Slunt H.H. Levey A.I. Thinakaran G. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43343-43350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 d shows that for all APP family members, the PS1 D385A mutant depresses reporter gene activation. For APP, only the terminal 44 amino acids containing the Fe65 binding motif (31Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30853-30856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) (YENPTY) is required for reporter gene activation (9Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Since the second phosphotyrosine binding domain of Fe65 has been shown to bind directly with all APP family members via the conserved YENPTY motif (32Duilio A. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. Zambrano N. Russo T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we questioned whether a similar 44 amino acid stretch from APLP1 and APLP2 (APLP1CT44 and APLP2CT44, respectively, Fig. 2 a) could also cause reporter gene activation. Additionally, this 44-amino acid fragment, which comprises most of the ALID fragment released upon γ-secretase cleavage, should be the minimal sequence needed for transcriptional activation. In Fig. 2 e we show that both the terminal 44 amino acids of APLP1 and APLP2 are sufficient to cause activation of the reporter gene, whereas their deletion from full-length constructs (APLP1ΔCT and APLP2ΔCT, Fig. 2 a) abolishes the activation (Fig. 2 f). To further show that gene activation requires interaction between the APLPs and Fe65, we created point mutants of APLP1CT44 and APLP2CT44 with the first tyrosine in the conserved YENPTY motif mutated to glycine. As Fig.3 a shows, for these point mutants, reporter gene activation drops nearly to baseline. We then performed GST pull down assays on fusion proteins containing the carboxyl termini of APLP1 and APLP2 with the same tyrosine mutated. Fig. 3 b shows that although wild type APP, APLP1, and APLP2 bind Fe65, APLP1, and APLP2 containing the point mutation binds Fe65 much less efficiently. Last, to confirm this interaction in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitations. Fig. 3 c shows that the amount of ALID immunoprecipitated by Fe65 decreases when the first tyrosine of the YENPTY motif is mutated. Thus, these data show a correlation between gene activation and Fe65-APLP interaction. In addition to the AID-Fe65 complex-stimulating reporter gene activation, full-length APP interacts with Fe65 to regulate its distribution between the nucleus and cytoplasm (9Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 33Minopoli G. de Candia P. Bonetti A. Faraonio R. Zambrano N. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6545-6550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to determine whether full-length APLP1 and APLP2 are able to accomplish the same task. We first performed immunocytochemistry on differentiated N2a cells to determine the localization of endogenous APLP1 and APLP2. Fig.4 a shows that both APLP1 and APLP2 are present in the perinuclear area (agreeing with previous data from immunohistochemistry on brain sections) (34McNamara M.J. Ruff C.T. Wasco W. Tanzi R.E. Thinakaran G. Hyman B.T. Brain Res. 1998; 804: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with some accumulation at the tips of neurites. To test whether the full-length APLP1 and APLP2 constructs used above for the luciferase assays were also able to regulate the distribution of Fe65, we expressed YFP-Fe65 along with either Gal4-tagged APLP1, APLP2, APLP1ΔCT or APLP2ΔCT and used immunocytochemistry to locate the Gal4BD epitope. We first wanted to confirm that the distribution of overexpressed APLP was similar to that of endogenous APLP. Fig. 4 b shows that the APLPs are located predominantly outside the nucleus similar to endogenous APLP. Fig. 4 b further shows that only the full-length proteins are able to exclude Fe65 from the nucleus; the deletion mutants, however, although they are localized mostly outside the nucleus, do not restrain Fe65 from moving into nucleus. Because of concerns that the Gal4-tagged APLPs would act different from the wild type proteins, we performed a similar analysis on wild type APP, APLP1, or APLP2 expressed along with GFP-Fe65. (Note that we changed Fe65 from the YFP to GFP fluorophore to allow compatibility with Alexa-594 used to stain the APLPs.) We found that Fe65 was restrained mostly to the cytoplasm when expressed along with APP, APLP1, or APLP2 but not with empty vector (data not shown). We speculated that the small amount of Fe65 present in the nucleus was due to Fe65 binding free AID or ALIDs. To eliminate processing nearly entirely so that no AID or ALID/Fe65 complexes would be released, we added 2 × 10−6m DAPT to the growth medium to inhibit γ-secretase processing. Fig. 4 c shows that nearly complete exclusion from the nucleus was obtained with APP, APLP1, or APLP2 but not with pcDNA3 empty vector. This data would be consistent with Fe65 binding the carboxyl terminal of the APLPs and it being constrained to the perinuclear space in the absence of γ-secretase processing. Upon γ-secretase cleavage, ALID probably along with bound Fe65 can travel to the nucleus to modulate gene expression. Finally, probably due to the instability of untagged AID and ALID peptides, we were unable to detect these endogenous fragments by Western blotting (Fig. 1). Still, to detect production of these fragments, we used the Gal4BD-tagged full-length constructs (so that tagged AID and ALIDs would be produced). Additionally, co-transfection of Fe65 was used to stabilize the ALID fragments as has been shown for AID (35Kimberly W.T. Zheng J.B. Guenette S.Y. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40288-40292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that in the absence of γ-secretase inhibitors there is an extra lower molecular weight band present, presumably tagged ALID1 and ALID2. Furthermore, in the presence of γ-secretase inhibitors, production of this band is inhibited, and there is an increase in accumulation of the APP intermediates C99/C83 as well as the APLP (C99/C83-like) intermediate fragments. Fig. 5 also shows that the size of the extra band is larger than the size of the Gal4BD-tagged constructs, which contain only the terminal 44 amino acids (APPCT44, APLP1CT44, and APLP2CT44). The larger size indicates that the γ-cleavage product is larger than 44 amino acids, perhaps large enough to account for an intramembranous cleavage site. Indeed, it is plausible that the APLPs may be cleaved, just like APP, in two distinct positions in the intramembranous portion. One of these cleavage sites may correspond to that recently characterized by Gu et al. (20Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35235-35238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In this report we show that APLP1 and APLP2, the other two members of the APP gene family, are cleaved by a Presenilin-dependent γ-secretase. This cleavage, just as for APP, releases the intracellular peptides ALID1 and ALID2. We also show that APLP1 and APLP2 can bind Fe65 and sequester Fe65 in the cytoplasm. In addition, our data suggest that ALID molecules released after γ-secretase cleavage enter the nucleus and can presumably activate gene transcription in an Fe65-dependent manner. These data indicate that just as APP undergoes regulated intramembranous proteolysis (13Brown M.S., Ye, J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar) by the γ-secretase to release a biologically active intracellular peptide, so too do APLP1 and APLP2. This study provides the first functional aspect of APP found to be conserved throughout the APP family and may partially explain the functional redundancy that exists among them during development. The possible transcriptional role for AID previously described by Cao and Sudhof (9Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) and for the ALIDs described here is derived using an artificial system involving Gal4BD-fusion APP/APLPs proteins and a Gal4-dependent reporter gene. Discovering physiological, endogenous target genes for the three APP family members will be essential in determining whether the results from this reporter system represent a true physiologic phenomenon. The recent implication of AID in the regulation of an endogenous gene (KAI-1) (12Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) suggests that the next step of our research should be to find genes that are regulated by the ALIDs. It is possible that AID, ALID1, and ALID2 may activate transcription of identical, partially overlapping, or distinct genes. The discovery of such genes may account for the different development phenotypes described by Heber et al. (24Heber S. Herms J. Gajic V. Hainfellner J. Aguzzi A.

Finally, with the growing list of γ-secretase substrates including Notch (36De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J.

Further work will be necessary to localize the site of the γ-cleavage of APLP1 and APLP2 and to determine whether an APP-specific inhibitor found by Petit et al. (41Petit A. Bihel F.

https://openalex.org/W2044841577,"The Menkes protein (MNK; ATP7A) is a copper-transporting P-type ATPase that is defective in the copper deficiency disorder, Menkes disease. MNK is localized in thetrans-Golgi network and transports copper to enzymes synthesized within secretory compartments. However, in cells exposed to excessive copper, MNK traffics to the plasma membrane where it functions in copper efflux. A conserved feature of all P-type ATPases is the formation of an acyl-phosphate intermediate, which occurs as part of the catalytic cycle during cation transport. In this study we investigated the effect of mutations within conserved catalytic regions of MNK on intracellular localization and trafficking from thetrans-Golgi network (TGN). Our findings suggest that mutations that block formation of the phosphorylated catalytic intermediate also prevent copper-induced relocalization of MNK from the TGN. Furthermore, mutations in the phosphatase domain, which resulted in hyperphosphorylation of MNK, caused constitutive trafficking from the TGN to the plasma membrane. A similar effect on trafficking was observed with a phosphatase mutation in the closely related copper ATPase, ATP7B, affected in Wilson disease. These findings suggest that the copper-induced trafficking of the Menkes and Wilson disease copper ATPases is associated with the phosphorylated intermediate that is formed during the catalysis of these pumps.

Our findings describe a novel mechanism for regulating the subcellular location of a transport protein involving the recognition of intermediate conformations during catalysis. Intracellular copper levels must be tightly controlled, as a deficiency or excess of copper is deleterious to cell survival. The requirement for intact cellular copper transport systems in humans is highlighted by two genetic disorders of copper metabolism, X-linked Menkes disease and autosomal recessive Wilson disease (1Danks D.M. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.M. Valle D. 7th Ed. The metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. 1. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 2211-2235Google Scholar). These genetic disorders are caused by mutations in distinct but closely related copper-transporting P-type ATPases, known as the Menkes protein (ATP7A or MNK) and the Wilson protein (ATP7B or WND). P-type ATPases are a family of ATP-driven cation transporters present in all phylae, whose various substrates include H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Ag+, and Cu+ (2Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). These proteins hydrolyze ATP and use the γ-phosphate to form an acyl-phosphorylated intermediate, which is subsequently dephosphorylated by an intrinsic phosphatase activity. This cycle of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation provides the energy for cation translocation across lipid bilayers (3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The MNK and WND proteins contain the hallmark sequences for ATP binding, phosphorylation, and phosphatase reactions; however, additional sequences have further classified MNK and WND proteins as heavy metal-transporting CPx-ATPases (4Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). These additional sequences include Cys-Pro-Cys (CPC) in the sixth membrane-spanning domain, a His-Pro (HP) dipeptide in the third cytoplasmic loop, and one or more amino-terminal metal binding motifs containing the core sequence, Cys-X-X-Cys (see Fig. 1 A) (4Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Studies in cultured cells have shown that MNK and WND proteins are copper exporters (5Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The proteins differ in their tissue distribution of expression; WND is predominantly expressed in the liver (7Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In Menkes patients, a defect in copper export from intestinal cells and aberrant distribution of copper around the body causes a systemic copper deficiency, with symptoms including severe neurological and connective tissue defects, impaired temperature control, and hypopigmentation (1Danks D.M.

The WND protein is required for the export of excess hepatic copper into the bile, and Wilson patients suffer a toxic build-up of hepatic copper and cirrhosis of the liver (1Danks D.M. Scriver C.R.

At this location, MNK and WND transport copper to the lumen of secretory compartments to provide copper to various copper-dependent enzymes (13Terada K. Nakako T. Yang X.L. Iida M. Aiba N.

We have shown previously that in the presence of elevated copper the MNK protein traffics to the plasma membrane, where it maintains copper homeostasis via copper efflux (11Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B.

In hepatocytes, copper induces the relocalization of WND to cytoplasmic vesicles associated with the canalicular membrane of bile ducts (12Schaefer M. Hopkins R.G. Failla M.L. Gitlin J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G639-G646PubMed Google Scholar). In non-hepatic cell types, WND relocalizes to an undefined population of cytoplasmic vesicles that may represent a novel copper storage/detoxification compartment (7Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y.

Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The copper-induced trafficking of MNK and WND serves to shift the function of these copper ATPases from their role in the biosynthesis of cuproenzymes in the TGN to copper export and the prevention of copper toxicity in post-TGN compartments. More recently, the regulated trafficking of the zinc importer, Zrt1 (17Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the copper importer, Ctr1 (18Ooi C.E. Rabinowich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), in response to changing levels of their respective metal ligands, has been identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Hence, the regulated trafficking of metal transporters is likely to be a general means by which metal ion homeostasis is regulated in all eukaryotic cells. So far there have been no studies on any transporter that address the mechanisms by which metal ions are sensed and how this information is coordinated with a trafficking response. Previous studies have identified several disease-causing mutations in MNK and WND that prevent the copper-induced trafficking from the TGN (16La Fontaine S. Theophilos M.B. Firth S.D. Parton R.G.

These mutations do not cluster within a distinct region, suggesting that the alterations are unlikely to directly affect copper-induced trafficking per se. Rather, we hypothesize that the trafficking of MNK and WND is dependent on copper transport activity and that these mutations indirectly prevent trafficking by affecting catalysis. The aim of this study was to explore this potential association between catalysis and trafficking by introducing disease-causing mutations into the MNK protein that occur in highly conserved sequences and were either known or predicted to abolish catalytic copper transport function. Mutations affecting the conserved CPC and HP sequences, and the phosphorylated aspartic acid inhibited copper-induced trafficking from the TGN. However, mutations within the phosphatase domain resulted in the constitutive relocalization of MNK to the plasma membrane without additional copper. These constitutive trafficking mutations were also associated with hyperphosphorylation of MNK. Our findings suggest that it is the formation of the phosphorylated intermediate during MNK catalysis that serves to trigger the exocytic trafficking of the transporter from the TGN. These findings identify a novel mechanism underlying the trafficking of a transport protein, whereby catalytic activity regulates the distribution between subcellular compartments. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 2 mml-proline and penicillin/streptomycin in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator. Affinity-purified MNK antibodies were raised in sheep against the amino-terminal copper binding domain as described previously (24Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol.

The Transformer mutagenesis kit (Clontech Laboratories) was used for all mutagenesis. The MNK mutagenic template was pCMB129, which contains a 2.1-kb EcoRV fragment in pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene). Mutant clones were verified by DNA sequencing (Applied Biosystems) and subcloned into the MNK expression construct pCMB344, which is a modified version of pCMB117 (6La Fontaine S. Firth S.D.

The WND expression construct contained the human WND cDNA ligated into the mammalian expression plasmid, pCMB77 (6La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Camakaris J. Engelzou A. Theophilos M.B. Petris M.J.

The TGE-AAA mutation within the WND cDNA was generated using the Transformer mutagenesis kit (Clontech) and verified by DNA sequencing. CHO cells cultured in 25-cm2flasks were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 and stable lines selected using G418 resistance (Invitrogen) as described previously (24Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2107-21175Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). MNK- and WND-positive wells were identified for each mutant clone by immunofluorescence microscopy, and three positive wells for each clone were expanded. MNK clones with similar expression levels were identified by immunoblotting experiments and used in subsequent immunofluorescence experiments. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (24Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2107-21175Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were cultured for 4 h in media containing 200 μm CuCl2 (+Cu condition). The basal copper condition was growth media without additional copper (∼0.5 μm copper). Alexa 594-conjugated anti-sheep antibodies or Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were diluted 1:1000 and used to detect primary antibodies. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (15Camakaris J. Petris M. Bailey L. Shen P. Lockhart P. Glover T.W. Barcroft C.L. Patton J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol.

The yeast transformants were grown overnight in YB medium and spotted in 10-fold serial dilutions onto minimal medium plates supplemented with 60 μm of the copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonic acid and 60 μmof the iron chelator bathophenanthroline disulfonic acid and grown for 2 days at 30 °C. Phosphorylation assays were performed using purified vesicles from yeast Δccc2transformants, as we have described recently (27Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). MNK phosphorylation assays were conducted using 20 μg of vesicle protein on ice in 20 mm MOPS buffer (pH 6.8), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm dithiothreitol, and 5 μm CuCl2. Phosphorylation reactions proceeded for 20 s after pulsing with 1 μm[γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mol; GeneWorks). The MNK protein was immunoprecipitated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and detected by autoradiography as we have described previously (27Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the copper chelator bathocuproine disulphonate (1 mm), or the phosphorylation inhibitor sodium vanadate (200 μm), were added to reactions (27Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We began this study by investigating whether copper-induced trafficking of the MNK protein is dependent on a functional copper transporter. Our initial strategy was to generate a series of missense mutations in highly conserved regions of MNK predicted to be functionally important and test their effects on subcellular location and copper-induced trafficking. The first mutation tested was C1000R, which was predicted to be functionally important, because it affects the first cysteine of the conserved1000CPC motif, and this mutation has been shown to cause Menkes disease (Fig. 1 A) (4Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar,28Tumer Z. Horn N. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 448: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An equivalent mutation, C396R, in the MNK ortholog ofEnterococcus hirae, mutation of the second cysteine of the CPC motif in the MNK ortholog of Caenorhabditis elegans, and mutation of both cysteines of the CPC of the WND protein have all been shown to inhibit copper transport activity (29Forbes J.R.

Biochem. 1998; 62: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The second mutation to be tested involved the histidine-proline dipeptide, which is conserved in all CPx-ATPases and located between 39 and 43 amino acids downstream of the phosphorylated aspartic acid (Fig.1 A). We mutated this histidine to glutamine (H1086Q) to mimic the common Wilson disease allele H1069Q (5Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that both the H1086Q mutation in MNK and the H1069Q mutation in WND impair copper transport (7Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 32Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

J Hum Genet. 1999; 44: 206-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) was the third mutation to be tested (Fig. 1 A). Leucine 873 is adjacent to the 875TGE motif, which is known as the transduction domain or phosphatase domain and is conserved in all P-type ATPases. Mutations in the TGE sequence of the H+- and Ca2+-ATPases inhibit cation transport by blocking the turnover of the phosphorylated protein and result in accumulation of the phosphorylated enzyme (34Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14088-14092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Portillo F. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To test the effect of these mutations on copper-regulated trafficking of MNK, mutant MNK constructs were transfected into CHO cells, and stable transfectants that expressed similar levels of the protein were identified for each mutant (Fig. 1 B). The transfected CHO cells were then used in immunofluorescence studies to assess localization and copper-induced trafficking of each mutant MNK protein. In basal copper conditions, the expected perinuclear distribution of the wild-type MNK (WtMNK) was observed, consistent with its location on the TGN (Fig. 2 A). Copper-induced trafficking of WtMNK to the plasma membrane was observed in cells incubated for 4 h in 200 μm copper (Fig.2 B), as we have demonstrated previously (11Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In basal copper conditions the mutant proteins, MNK-C1000R and MNK-H1086Q, were detected in the perinuclear region of cells (Fig. 2, C andE). As we have reported previously for WtMNK (11Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), the treatment of cells with brefeldin A caused contraction of both MNK-C1000R and MNK-H1086Q to a tight juxtanuclear spot (data not shown), which is a specific effect of brefeldin A on proteins of the TGN. These data suggested that neither C1000R nor H1086Q mutations interfered with the TGN localization of MNK. However, in elevated copper both the MNK-C1000R and MNK-H1086Q proteins remained in the TGN and did not traffic to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, Dand F). Increases in the copper concentration or exposure time did not change this perinuclear location of MNK-C1000R and MNK-H1086Q proteins (data not shown). These observations were consistent with the hypothesis that copper-induced trafficking of MNK is dependent on a functional copper transporter. A surprising result was obtained when we investigated the distribution of the MNK-L873R protein. Rather than being TGN-localized under basal copper conditions, the L873R mutant was associated predominantly with the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 G). This distribution differed from the perinuclear location of WtMNK, C1000R, and H1086Q proteins in basal medium and resembled that of the WtMNK protein under elevated copper conditions (Fig. 2 B). Elevated copper treatment did not change the apparent distribution of the MNK-L873R protein (Fig.2 H). The leucine 873 residue lies two amino acids away from the 875TGE phosphatase domain (Fig. 1 A). Mutation of the TGE motif in the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump causes hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting turnover of the E1-P conformation of the enzyme (34Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14088-14092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This information highlighted a possible connection between MNK phosphorylation and its exocytic trafficking. Therefore, we speculated that the plasma membrane location of the L873R mutant protein may be because of the accumulation of the MNK-phosphorylated catalytic intermediate. To this test hypothesis more directly, we investigated the effect of mutations within the phosphorylation site and the phosphatase domain on MNK phosphorylation and trafficking. The aspartic acid residue within the signature sequence, DKTGT, is the site of acyl-phosphate formation in all P-type ATPases (36Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Studies involving the expression of MNK in the yeast S. cerevisiae have shown that the aspartic acid in the DKTGT motif is essential for copper transport (27Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This yeast copper transport assay involves expression of MNK in the Δccc2 mutant, which lacks the MNK homologue, Ccc2. In the absence of Ccc2, the Δccc2 mutant is unable to grow on copper- and iron-limited medium, because copper transport by Ccc2 to the secreted cuproenzyme, Fet3, is essential for high affinity iron uptake. The expression of MNK complements the poor growth of theΔccc2 mutant on media limited in copper and iron (27Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 32Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Vesicle preparations from the MNK-expressing Δccc2 mutant have shown that MNK forms an acyl-phosphate intermediate and that this is dependent on the Asp1044 residue in the DKTGT motif (27Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We confirmed these previous findings in our study by showing complementation of the Δccc2 growth defect with expression of the wild-type MNK protein (Fig.3 C) and the formation of a phosphorylated intermediate (Fig. 3 A). As expected, the D1044E mutation inhibited the formation of the phosphoenzyme (Fig.3 A) and failed to complement the defective growth phenotype of the Δccc2 mutant (Fig. 3 C). The phosphorylation of the 875TGE-AAA protein was elevated relative to the WtMNK protein (Fig. 3 A), consistent with the predicted role of the TGE motif in dephosphorylation during catalysis (34Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14088-14092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Portillo F. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Significantly, the L873R mutant, which was constitutively located on vesicles and at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2), also caused hyperphosphorylation of MNK (Fig. 3 A). The hyperphosphorylation of 875TGE-AAA and L873R mutants was consistent with the predicted importance of the TGE motif in dephosphorylation of P-type ATPase proteins. The phosphorylation of875TGE-AAA and L873R mutants was inhibited by the copper chelator, bathocuproine disulfonic acid, indicating that this phosphorylation was copper-dependent (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, vanadate, a specific inhibitor of aspartyl-phosphate formation in P-type ATPases, impaired the phosphorylation of the TGE-AAA and L873R mutants (Fig. 3 B). These observations suggest that both 875TGE-AAA and L873R mutations caused hyperphosphorylation of MNK and that copper is required as a substrate to initiate this process. Both the 875TGE-AAA and L873R mutants failed to complement the growth defect of theΔccc2 mutant (Fig. 3 C), and this was consistent with these mutations blocking the catalytic copper transport cycle. We then explored the relationship between phosphorylation and copper-induced trafficking of MNK after stably expressing the D1044E and 875TGE-AAA mutant proteins in CHO cells. In basal copper conditions, the MNK-D1044E protein was located in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4 C), as found for the wild-type MNK protein (Fig. 4 A). However, in cells exposed to 200 μm copper for 4 h, MNK-D1044E remained perinuclear (Fig. 4 D). No difference to this location was observed with increased copper levels or exposure times (up to 400 μm Cu and 72 h; data not shown). These findings suggested that the copper-induced trafficking of MNK requires the formation of the acyl-phosphate catalytic intermediate. Significantly, in basal medium the MNK(875TGE-AAA) protein was constitutively located at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 E), similar to the effect of the L873R mutation shown earlier (Fig.2 G). No difference in distribution was observed with addition of excess copper to the growth medium (Fig. 4 F). Hence, both the 875TGE-AAA and L873R mutations caused constitutive relocalization of MNK from the TGN and caused hyperphosphorylation of MNK in vitro. This was in sharp contrast to the D1044E mutation, which inhibited both the phosphorylation and trafficking response of MNK. Taken together, these findings suggest that copper-induced trafficking of MNK from the TGN to the plasma membrane requires a catalytically active enzyme and is associated with formation of the phosphorylated catalytic intermediate. Our studies showed that severe copper limitation in vitroinhibited phosphorylation of both 875TGE-AAA and L873R mutants (Fig. 3 B). To further explore the correlation between catalysis and trafficking in vivo, we tested whether copper limitation would prevent the plasma membrane distribution of the875TGE-AAA and L873R mutants. Reduced levels of both mutant proteins at the plasma membrane were observed in cells passaged several times in media depleted of copper with chelators; however, cell viability was also compromised (data not shown). It is important to note that in addition to inhibiting MNK catalysis, copper depletion is also expected reduce the activity of cytochrome c oxidase, a copper-dependent enzyme involved in generating cellular ATP. Moreover, ATP is directly required for the MNK catalytic reaction cycle, as well as being an indirect energy source for protein trafficking. These potential secondary effects made analysis of copper depletion on the location of the phosphatase mutant difficult to interpret. Therefore, we chose a genetic approach for testing the catalysis-dependent trafficking model. We reasoned that if the hyperphosphorylation of the 875TGE-AAA mutant triggered trafficking to the plasma membrane, then a second mutation of the aspartic acid phosphorylation site to make a double mutant should suppress this relocalization. A double mutant containing both the D1044E and 875TGE-AAA mutations, MNK(D1044E/TGE-AAA), was stably expressed in CHO cells. The location of the MNK(D1044E/TGE-AAA) protein in cells in basal media was exclusively perinuclear (Fig.4 G) and failed to undergo relocalization to the plasma membrane in cells exposed to elevated copper (Fig. 4 H). Thus, the D1044E mutation suppressed the 875TGE-AAA mutation, as would be predicted if copper-induced trafficking of MNK requires formation of a phosphorylated catalytic intermediate. The Wilson disease copper transporting P-type ATPase (WND or ATP7B) is located within the TGN in basal copper conditions. However, the WND protein traffics to cytoplasmic vesicles rather than the plasma membrane in response to elevated copper (7Hung I.H. Suzuki M. Yamaguchi Y. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21461-21466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 23Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To explore whether copper-induced trafficking of the WND ATPase occurs via a similar mechanism to MNK, we tested whether mutation of the 858TGE sequence of WND would trigger a constitutive trafficking response. Immunofluorescence microscopy of transfected CHO cells confirmed previous studies and showed WtWND to be located in the perinuclear region under basal copper conditions (Fig. 5 A) and relocalized to cytoplasmic vesicles in response to elevated copper (Fig. 5 B). Significantly, the WND(TGE-AAA) protein was present in a population of cytoplasmic vesicles under basal copper conditions (Fig. 5 C), which resembled the distribution of WtWND in cells exposed to elevated copper (Fig. 5 B). There was no change to the vesicular staining of the WND(TGE-AAA) protein upon exposure of cells to elevated copper (Fig. 5 D). Hence, the TGE mutation in WND appeared to mimic the effect of elevated copper on the wild-type protein and was analogous to the plasma membrane localization observed for the TGE mutation in MNK. Collectively, these data suggest that a similar mechanism underlies the copper-induced trafficking of both MNK and WND proteins, which involves the formation of the acyl-phosphate intermediate during catalysis. Disease-causing mutations in MNK and WND have been shown previously to prevent copper-induced trafficking from the TGN. MNK trafficking-defective mutations include A1364V in the seventh transmembrane domain (19Ambrosini L. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1547-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a deletion of 800AL in second cytoplasmic loop (20La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P. Brooks H. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and mutations in the amino-terminal copper binding domains (21Goodyer I.D. Jones E.E. Monaco A.P. Francis M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1473-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Strausak D. La Fontaine S. Hill J. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Mercer J.F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). WND trafficking mutations include G943S in the fifth transmembrane region (23Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), mutation of the conserved983CPC motif within the sixth transmembrane domain (23Forbes J.R. Cox D.W. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and M1356V in the eighth transmembrane region (16La Fontaine S. Theophilos M.B. Firth S.D. Parton R.G. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that mutations affecting copper-induced trafficking do not appear to cluster within a single region and thus did not reveal a single distinct motif essential for trafficking. We hypothesized that trafficking is coupled with catalysis of MNK and WND and that mutations that impair copper transport activity also prevent trafficking. To explore this hypothesis further, we introduced three disease-associated mutations into sequences of MNK that are highly conserved in heavy metal ATPases. The C1000R and H1086Q mutations blocked copper-induced trafficking of MNK from the TGN; however, L873R caused constitutive localization of MNK at the plasma membrane under basal and elevated copper conditions. The close proximity of the L873R mutation to the TGE phosphatase domain provided a clue to the possible association of copper-induced trafficking of MNK with formation of phosphorylated catalytic intermediate. We found that mutation of the phosphorylation site of MNK impaired both the copper-induced trafficking to the plasma membrane and the formation of the phosphorylated intermediate. However, the TGE-AAA and L873R mutations resulted in hyperphosphorylation, and this was associated with a constitutive relocalization from the TGN. These findings suggest that formation of the acyl-phosphate intermediate is required for trafficking of MNK, and by locking the protein in the phosphorylated state, a constitutive trafficking response occurs even in basal copper conditions. Moreover, the finding that the double mutant D1044E/TGE-AAA inhibited copper-regulated trafficking from the TGN demonstrated that the plasma membrane location of the TGE-AAA mutation alone was dependent on catalytic phosphorylation of MNK at Asp1044. This TGE-AAA localization was unlikely to have arisen through protein misfolding and secretion to the plasma membrane and was consistent with the phosphorylation-dependent trafficking model. The analysis of the phosphatase mutation in the WND ATPase provided further evidence for a link between the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate and copper-induced trafficking. The WND phosphatase mutation caused constitutive relocalization from the TGN to a vesicular distribution in basal medium, which appeared similar to that induced by elevated copper for the wild-type WND protein. Thus, the phosphatase domain mutations in both MNK and WND result in relocalization from the TGN. But rather than both proteins trafficking to the plasma membrane, these proteins were targeted to destinations that were similar to those of their respective wild-type proteins under elevated copper conditions and suggested preservation of sorting signals for targeting MNK and WND to the appropriate the post-TGN trafficking pathways. How does this model of phosphorylation-dependent trafficking explain the copper-induced relocalization of MNK and WND from the TGN? The copper-induced trafficking of MNK and WND proteins presumably switches the function of these ATPases from their nutritional roles in metallating secreted cuproenzymes to protective roles in the export of excess copper in post-Golgi compartments and the plasma membrane. Our studies suggest that a key aspect of this switch in function is the catalytic cycle of the ATPase itself. It is unclear at this stage whether exocytic sorting of MNK and WND into vesicles at the TGN is directly coupled with formation of the phosphorylated intermediate or whether this sorting process involves additional downstream conformations or modifications. Moreover, the adaptor proteins that are likely to be involved in recognizing MNK and WND and recruiting these transporters into vesicles have not been identified. However, the identification of mutations in this study that either prevent or constitutively induce this trafficking response provides exciting new tools for identifying these sorting proteins. It is important to note that the catalysis-dependent trafficking model does not predict that MNK and WND will undergo trafficking from the TGN with every catalytic cycle. Several factors that may determine whether a catalytically active transporter will be recruited into an exocytic vesicle include correct localization within a distinct subcompartment of the TGN for protein sorting or the affinity of the ATPases for components of the protein sorting machinery. Indeed, it is likely that a proportion of MNK and WND protein must be retained in the TGN or earlier secretory compartments to complete catalytic cycling without undergoing exocytosis to load copper onto secreted cuproenzymes (13Terada K.

Genet. 2000; 9: 2845-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The catalysis-dependent trafficking model suggests that the steady state TGN location of MNK and WND under low copper conditions is a reflection of the small proportion of molecules cycling through phosphorylated catalytic intermediates. The shift in distribution of MNK and WND from the TGN upon exposure to elevated copper can be explained by an increase in the proportion of catalytically active proteins and thus the number of transporters cycling through the phosphorylated conformation. By coupling the trafficking of the copper ATPases with catalytic activity, this would allow an appropriate equilibrium of the ATPases to be established between the TGN and post-TGN compartments following dietary copper intake. Moreover, this would provide autoregulation of the trafficking response. In this scenario, the trafficking of MNK and WND proteins to post-TGN compartments would allow the removal of excess copper. This would then lower copper levels to the point where catalytic turnover is insufficient to maintain a steady-state post-TGN distribution, and the equilibrium is ultimately shifted back to the TGN. In summary, our findings provide the first molecular insights into the mechanism by which the mammalian copper ATPases traffic from the TGN in response to copper. The regulation of subcellular distribution of a transport protein through a mechanism involving recognition of catalytic intermediates is unlike other known regulated trafficking mechanisms. It remains to be shown whether a similar strategy has been adopted for the metal-regulated trafficking of other proteins such as the zinc importer, Zrt1, and the copper importer, Ctr1, and the prion disease protein, PrP (17Gitan R.S.

https://openalex.org/W1979435019,"We have used an extensive mutagenesis approach to study the specific role of the eight structural domains of Vav during both the activation and signaling steps of this Rac1 exchange factor. Our results indicate that several Vav domains (Dbl homology, pleckstrin homology, and zinc finger) are essential for all the biological activities tested, whereas others are required for discrete, cell type-specific biological effects. Interestingly, we have found that Vav domains have no unique functions. Thus, the calponin homology domain mediates the inhibition of Vav both in vitro and in vivo but, at the same time, exerts effector functions in lymphocytes upon receptor activation. The Vav SH2 and SH3 regions play regulatory roles in the activation of Vav in fibroblasts, mediating both its phosphorylation and translocation to the plasma membrane. In contrast, the Vav SH2 and SH3 regions act as scaffolding platforms in T-cells, ensuring the proper phosphorylation of Vav and the subsequent engagement of downstream effectors. We also provide evidence indicating that the zinc finger region exerts at least three different functional roles in Vav, aiding in the down-regulation of its basal activity, the engagement of substrates, and the induction of ancillary pathways required for cell transformation. Finally, the results obtained are consistent with a new regulatory model for Vav, in which the calponin homology region inhibits the basal activity of Vav through interactions with the zinc finger region.

Vav proteins are phosphorylation-dependent exchange factors that catalyze the release of GDP from Rho/Rac family members, thereby facilitating their transition from the inactive (GDP-bound) to the active (GTP-bound) state (1Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Google Scholar). This activity is crucial for the coordination of developmental and mitogenic processes. Thus, the elimination of the vav gene results in impaired lymphoid development, lymphopenia, and defective immune responses in mice (2Fischer K.D. Zmuldzinas A. Gardner S. Barbacid M. Bernstein A. Guidos C. Nature. 1995; 374: 474-477Google Scholar, 3Tarakhovsky A. Turner M. Schaal S. Mee P.J. Duddy L.P. Rajewsky K. Tybulewicz V.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 467-470Google Scholar, 4Turner M. Mee P.J.

Similarly, deletion of either vav2 orvav3 genes results in impaired signaling responses in activated B-cells (6Doody G.M. Bell S.E. Vigorito E. Clayton E. McAdam S. Tooze R. Fernandez C. Lee I.J. Turner M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 542-547Google Scholar, 7Tedford K. Nitschke L. Girkontaite I. Charlesworth A. Chan G. Sakk V. Barbacid M. Fischer K.D. Nat.

It has also been demonstrated that the subversion on the normal activation/deactivation cycle of some members of the Vav family results in severe alterations of cell behavior, including tumorigenesis, changes in F-actin organization, and the acquisition of metastatic properties by transformed cells (1Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Google Scholar). Finally, the activation of Vav or Vav2 proteins by the Nef protein of the human immunodeficiency virus plays an essential role in the pathogenic cycle of this virus (9Fackler O.T. Luo W. Geyer M. Alberts A.S. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 729-739Google Scholar, 10Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6372-6381Google Scholar). One important feature of this GEF family is the structural complexity of its members (1Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Google Scholar, 10Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6372-6381Google Scholar) (see Fig.1 A). Mammalian and avian Vav proteins contain eight structural domains, including a calponin homology (CH) 1The abbreviations used are: CH, calponin homology; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; ZF, zinc finger; Ac, acidic; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; MBP, myelin basic protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol biphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol triphosphate; GEF, guanosine nucleotide exchange factor; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; HA, hemagglutinin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; EGF-R, epidermal growth factor-receptor.1The abbreviations used are: CH, calponin homology; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology; ZF, zinc finger; Ac, acidic; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; MBP, myelin basic protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol biphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol triphosphate; GEF, guanosine nucleotide exchange factor; GDI, GDP dissociation inhibitor; HA, hemagglutinin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; EGF-R, epidermal growth factor-receptor. region, an acidic (Ac) domain, the catalytic Dbl homology (DH) region, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a zinc finger (ZF) region similar to those present in c-Raf and protein kinase C family members, and a SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains. Caenorhabditis elegansand Drosophila melanogaster Vav differ mostly at the C terminus, where they lack the P:most N-terminal SH3 domain. Recent evidence suggests that these domains are specialized in the coordination of catalytic, regulatory, signaling, and/or targeting functions. In the case of the CH region, this domain negatively affects the function of Vav, because deletions of its first 66 amino acids lead to the oncogenic activation of the vav proto-oncogene (11Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether this mutation affects the activity of Vav in cis or in trans, because this oncoprotein is still dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation for the activation of its exchange activity (12Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Google Scholar). In this respect, this region has been also shown to interact with both Rho/Rac GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDI) and with the transcriptional factor Enx1 (13Groysman M. Russek C.S. Katzav S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 75-80Google Scholar, 14Hobert O. Jallal B. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3066-3073Google Scholar), indicating that at least part of the function of this domain could be associated with the formation of heteromolecular interactions. Interestingly, it has been proposed that the Vav CH region has effector functions in T-cells, because the deletion of this domain abrogates the activation of NF-AT by Vav in lymphocytes (10Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6372-6381Google Scholar, 15Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Google Scholar). The Vav acidic domain plays a negative regulatory role on the activity of Vav through one of its residues, Tyr174 (16Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Google Scholar, 17Bustelo X.R. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 24-30Google Scholar). NMR studies have shown that this residue interacts with amino acids located in the DH domain, leading to a “closed” conformation of the protein incapable of interacting with its GTPase substrates. This intramolecular interaction is disrupted by the phosphorylation of Tyr174, leading to the generation of an “open,” catalytically competent Vav conformation. Due to this regulatory mechanism, Vav proteins are totally dependent on phosphorylation for the activation of their catalytic and biological activities (16Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Google Scholar, 17Bustelo X.R. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 24-30Google Scholar). On the other hand, the DH region is in charge of establishing the interaction with Rho/Rac proteins, leading to the subsequent catalysis of GDP/GTP exchange on these GTPases. The function of the Vav PH region has not yet been fully elucidated. Broek and co-workers (18Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Google Scholar, 19Das B. Shu X. Day G.J. Han J. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. Broek D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15074-15081Google Scholar) have proposed that this domain regulates the catalytic activity of Vav by an on/off mechanism based on the binding of phosphatidylinositol biphosphate (PIP2) or phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3). Although this model is supported by results obtained in different experimental settings, its physiological significance remains unclear (17Bustelo X.R. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 24-30Google Scholar). The ZF region seems to play an important, although not yet fully elucidated, regulatory function on Vav. Studies with Vav3 have shown that the integrity of the ZF region is important for the optimal binding of this GEF to its substrates, probably by offering an additional area of contact with the GTPase (20Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether this is the exclusive function of the Vav ZF domain. Finally, the C-terminal SH2 and SH3 domains participate in protein-protein interactions with regulatory and/or effector functions. The SH2 domain is important for the interaction with autophosphorylated tyrosine kinases and with adaptor proteins such as Slp76 or Blnk (1Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Google Scholar, 10Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6372-6381Google Scholar). The N-terminal SH3 domain binds to the adaptor protein Grb2 (21Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12629-12633Google Scholar, 22Nishida M. Nagata K. Hachimori Y. Horiuchi M. Ogura K. Mandiyan V. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2995-3007Google Scholar). This interaction appears to be important in lymphoid cells, because the binding of Vav to Grb2 makes possible its association with LAT and CD28, two membrane-anchored proteins that allow the translocation of Vav to the plasma membrane and its interaction with the upstream tyrosine kinases (1Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Google Scholar, 10Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6372-6381Google Scholar). In agreement with this model, mutations in CD28 and LAT impair the phosphorylation of Vav during T-cell receptor signaling (1Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Google Scholar, 10Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6372-6381Google Scholar). Finally, the C-terminal SH3 domain is characterized by its interactive promiscuity, because it can form complexes with a wide variety of proteins including cytoskeletal regulators (zyxin), RNA-binding proteins (hnRNP-K, hnRNP-C, and p44), transcriptional modulators (Ku-70), and ubiquitination factors such as Cbl-b (1Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Google Scholar, 23Bustelo X.R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 65-88Google Scholar). The actual participation of those proteins in the biological functions of Vav remains undefined. Despite these advances, we still lack considerable information about the mechanism by which all these separate functions are assembled during signal transduction to facilitate the activation of the catalytic activity of Vav and the induction of downstream effectors. To shed light onto this process, we studied the effect of mutations in all the aforementioned structural domains on the biological activity of wild type Vav and its four known oncogenic versions (Δ1–66, Δ1–186, Δ1–186+Δ608–845, and Y3xF). All these mutant proteins were tested in terms of exchange activity in vitro and in a number of biological read-outs (transforming activity, JNK activation, morphological change, NF-AT activation, and phosphorylation) using fibroblast, kidney, and lymphoid cell lines. Polyclonal antibodies to the Vav DH, ZF, and SH3-SH2-SH3 domains were raised in rabbits using either GST or MBP fusion proteins purified from Escherichia coli. Other antibodies used include AU5 and HA (Babco), hexahistidine, MBP, and GST (Sigma), phosphotyrosine residues (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD3 (Dako), and EGFP (Clontech). Immunoblots were developed using chemiluminescent methods (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Vav point mutants were obtained using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Truncated proteins were generated by using either appropriate internal restriction sites (i.e. BamHI for deletions of the C-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3 region) or PCR according to standard procedures. The inclusion of the K-Ras tail was done by ligating two annealed phosphorylated oligonucleotides (mVav-CAAX-F, 5′-GATCCCATGTATGTCATGTAAGTGAGTCCTCTCCTGAC-3′, and mVav-CAAX-R, 5′-AATTGTCAGGAGAGGACGCACTTACATGACATACATGG-3′) to linearized, Vav-encoding plasmid. All mutant cDNAs were subjected to automatic sequence analysis to avoid the possibility of extra mutations. Details regarding the generation of specific constructs and mutants are available upon request. All vavcDNAs were used in the mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pMEX (see “Results”). For the generation of mammalian expression vectors containing EGFP/Vav domains, the DH, PH, and ZF regions were amplified by PCR from the vavproto-oncogene cDNA and cloned into pEGFP-C (Clontech). pcDNA-HA-JNK1 and pNF-AT/luc plasmids were gifts from Dr. P. Crespo (Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas “Alberto Sols,” Madrid, Spain) and Dr. G. R. Crabtree (Departments of Developmental Biology and Pathology, Stanford University Medical School, Stanford, CA), respectively. Plasmids pFR-luc and pFA2-cJun were purchased from Stratagene. For focus formation assays, NIH3T3 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, as described (24van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Google Scholar). After transfections, cells were cultured for 15 days, fixed with formaldehyde, and stained with Giemsa for the final quantitation of foci. For morphological assays, NIH3T3 or COS1 cells were transfected using liposomes (FuGENE 6, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. To visualize the transfected cells, each plasmid was co-transfected with low amounts of an EGFP-coding vector (pEGFP-C1, Clontech). Staining of F-actin in fixed cells was done with phalloidin-rhodamine (Molecular Probes) as described (20Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Google Scholar). COS1 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran for detecting protein/phosphorylation levels, JNK-1 activation, and Rac1 stimulation assays (25Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays with immunoprecipitated HA-JNK-1 were done in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP using GST-ATF2 as phosphate acceptor (25Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Google Scholar). Rac1 stimulation in vivo was determined by GST-PAK pull-down experiments, as described (26Wery-Zennaro S. Zugaza J.L. Letourneur M. Bertoglio J. Pierre J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1596-1604Google Scholar). Expression of proteins in hematopoietic cells was done by electroporation, exactly as described (25Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Google Scholar). In the case of NF-AT assays, Jurkat cells were electroporated with 5 μg of pNF-AT/luc together with 20 μg of either empty or cDNA-containing expression vectors. For JNK assays, Jurkat cells were transfected with a mixture of 5 μg of pFR-Luc and 2 μg of pFA2-cJun together with 20 μg of either empty or cDNA-containing plasmids. After 48 h, cells were either left unstimulated or stimulated for 8 h with anti-CD3 antibodies (10 μg·ml−1), washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution, lysed in a buffered solution, and evaluated for luciferase activity, exactly as described before (25Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Google Scholar). Proteins were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells using affinity chromatography as described before (20Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Google Scholar). The Vav CH domain was generated by PCR and cloned into pGEX-2T. The pGEX vector encoding the Rac1 binding domain of PAK (pGST-PAK-RBD) was provided by Dr. R. Cerione (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). All GST proteins were purified by chromatography onto glutathione beads following standard procedures (20Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Google Scholar). To generate MBP fusion proteins, the indicated domains of Vav were amplified by PCR using the vav proto-oncogene cDNA as template and cloned into the pMAL-c vector (New England Biolabs). The MBP-β-galactosidase fusion protein was obtained by inducing the unmodified commercial vector pMAL-c. MBP fusion proteins were induced in E. coli (strain DH5α) and purified using amylose beads (New England Biolabs), as indicated by the commercial supplier. Exchange reactions were performed in duplicate at room temperature for 45 min using 15 pmol of GDP-bound Rac1 and 3.5 pmol of Vav proteins in the presence of [35S]GTPγS, as described previously (20Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Google Scholar). In vitro binding experiments with Vav purified from Sf9 cells were performed as indicated (20Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Google Scholar). In the case of binding assays with Rac1, the GTPase (75 pmol) was stripped of nucleotides by incubation for 10 min at room temperature in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 ng of bovine serum albumin per ml, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After these incubations, the buffer was supplemented with 50 mm MgCl2 plus either GDP (450 μm) or no nucleotides and then incubated an additional 30 min. Then 30 μl of glutathione beads and Vav proteins (55 pmol) were added to the GTPase solution. After an incubation of 3 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with binding buffer plus 50 mm MgCl2, boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblots. In the case of binding with GST-Vav CH proteins, the stripping protocol was bypassed. Binding experiments withE. coli-derived proteins were done as follows. Amylose beads coated with MBP fusion proteins (700 pmol) were incubated with GST-Vav CH+Ac (100 pmol) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mmimidazole, and 500 μg·ml−1 bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at room temperature (27Han J. Das B. Wei W. Van Aelst L. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Google Scholar). Amylose beads were washed twice with binding buffer and 5 times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 60 mmimidazole. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblots with anti-GST antibodies. For binding experiments with COS1 cell lysates, these cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmids encoding EGFP-Vav DH, EGFP-Vav PH, or EGFP-Vav ZF. After 48 h, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline solution and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg·ml−1 leupeptin, 10 units·ml−1 aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Immobilized GST-CH+Ac (100 pmol) was incubated with COS1 cells lysates for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed in RIPA buffer without SDS and sodium deoxycholate, as described (28Chen R. Kim O. Li M. Xiong X. Guan J.L. Kung H.J. Chen H. Shimizu Y. Qiu Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 439-444Google Scholar). After washing, proteins were analyzed by Western blot using anti-EGFP antibodies. In order to study the functional relevance of the structural domains of Vav in all aspects of the biology of this GEF, we inactivated each of them by generating either truncations (CH, Ac, SH3, SH2, and SH3 domains) or appropriate missense mutations (Ac, DH, PH, ZF, SH3, SH2, and SH3) in wild type Vav and its four known oncogenic versions (Vav-(Δ1–66), Vav-(Δ1–186), Vav-(Δ1–186+Δ608–845), and Vav Y3xF) (Fig.1 A). Wild type and Δ1–66 are forms of Vav whose exchange activity is phosphorylation-dependent (Fig. 1 A,proteins 1 and 3). Vav-(Δ1–186) and Vav-(Δ1–186+Δ608–845) have acquired phosphorylation-independent exchange activities because of the deletion of the CH and Ac domains (Fig. 1 A, proteins 5 and 6) (29Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Google Scholar). Vav-(Δ1–186+Δ608–845) lacks, in addition to the CH-Ac domains, the C-terminal SH3-SH2-SH3 region (Fig.1 A, protein 6) (29Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Google Scholar). Vav Y3xF has three tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations affecting the main negative regulatory site of Vav (Tyr174) and two adjacent tyrosine residues (Tyr142 and Tyr160) (Fig. 1 A,protein 2). These two sites cooperate with Tyr174 in the activation/inactivation of Vav during signal transduction (16Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Google Scholar, 25Lopez-Lago M. Lee H. Cruz C. Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1678-1691Google Scholar). By using all these proteins, we expected to be able to estimate the relative contribution of each domain to effector, regulatory, and/or phosphorylation-dependent functions. In order to facilitate the comparison of all Vav mutants, we cloned all cDNAs in the same plasmid backbones. We utilized the pMEX vector for studies in NIH3T3 and Jurkat T-cells, a non-commercial mammalian expression plasmid that regulates gene expression through the murine mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat promoter. For some studies in COS cells (JNK activation, phosphorylation, and Rac1 activation), the same cDNAs were subcloned in pcDNA3, a mammalian expression vector containing a cytomegalovirus promoter and the SV40 replication origin that allows the episomal amplification of plasmids in the transfected cell. The biological activity of each of these proteins was measured in NIH3T3 cells (for transforming activity and morphological change), Jurkat T-cells (for NF-AT and JNK activation measurements), and/or COS1 cells (for morphological change, phosphorylation levels, Rac1 activation, and JNK stimulation). According to the current model for Vav activation, the main regulatory step mediating the activation of Vav during signal transduction is the phosphorylation of Tyr174 and adjacent tyrosine residues (Tyr142and Tyr160) (16Aghazadeh B. Lowry W.E. Huang X.Y. Rosen M.K. Cell. 2000; 102: 625-633Google Scholar, 17Bustelo X.R. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 24-30Google Scholar). Thus, we expected that mutations in these three residues would lead to the generation of a highly transforming protein. To test this hypothesis, we compared the transforming activity of Vav Y3xF with those induced by wild type Vav, Vav-(Δ1–66), and two different versions of Vav-(Δ1–186) (Δ1–186 and Δ1–186+Δ608–845). As expected from previous results (29Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Google Scholar), we found that wild type Vav has very low transforming activity, whereas Vav-(Δ1–66) and Vav-(Δ1–186) display moderate and very high transforming potential, respectively (Fig. 1 B, compare bars 1,3, and 5, respectively). The deletion of the SH3-SH2-SH3 region of Vav-(Δ1–186) reduces, but does not abolish, the transforming activity of this protein (Fig. 1 B, bar 6). These results are in agreement with previous observations indicating that the activities of Vav-(Δ1–186) and Vav2-(Δ1–187) are independent of their phosphorylation status (29Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Google Scholar). Interestingly, Vav Y3xF shows in these assays a transforming activity similar to the phosphorylation-dependent Vav oncoprotein (Vav-(Δ1–66)) and significantly lower than that shown by Vav-(Δ1–186) (Fig.1 B, compare bar 2 with bars 3 and5). This observation indicated to us that, at least in anin vivo context, the removal of the inhibitory tyrosine residues is not sufficient for the full activation of Vav and that the CH region also contributes to the inhibition of Vav. To corroborate this possibility, we generated one additional Vav mutant protein (Δ1–144) lacking the entire CH domain (Fig. 1 A,protein 4). As shown in Fig. 1 B (bar 4), this new version of Vav displays a transforming activity similar to the Vav-(Δ1–186) oncoprotein described previously (Fig.1 A, compare bars 4 and 5) and significantly higher than the Y3xF mutant (Fig. 1 A, comparebars 4 and 2). Similar results were obtained when all these Vav mutants were tested for their ability to induce morphological change and JNK activation in NIH3T3 cells and COS1 cells (Table I).Table IBiological activity of Vav proteins used in this studyType of Vav proteinCell type and biological read-outaValues are given relative to each specific biological read-out and should not be compared among different columns.

Open table in a new tab To investigate whether the inhibitory effect of the CH region foundin vivo was mediated by mechanisms in cis or intrans, we evaluated the transforming activity of a truncated Vav protein in which its CH region was transferred from the N to the C terminus of the molecule (Fig. 1 A, protein 7). This domain swapping should not affect the ability of the CH to interact in trans with other proteins, because the CH-binding proteins RhoGDI and Enx-1 were cloned using two-hybrid experiments in which the Vav CH region was placed downstream of the Gal4 DNA binding domain (13Groysman M. Russek C.S. Katzav S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 75-80Google Scholar, 14Hobert O. Jallal B. Ullrich A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3066-3073Google Scholar). This chimeric protein was properly expressed in vivo (Fig. 1 C, lanes labeled 7). This version of Vav was as transforming as Vav-(Δ1–186+Δ608–845) (Fig. 1 B, compare bars 6 and 7), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of this domain is"
https://openalex.org/W1986496434,"The last deglaciation was marked by large, hemispheric, millennial-scale climate variations: the Bølling-Allerød and Younger Dryas periods in the north, and the Antarctic Cold Reversal in the south. A chronology from the high-accumulation Law Dome East Antarctic ice core constrains the relative timing of these two events and provides strong evidence that the cooling at the start of the Antarctic Cold Reversal did not follow the abrupt warming during the northern Bølling transition around 14,500 years ago. This result suggests that southern changes are not a direct response to abrupt changes in North Atlantic thermohaline circulation, as is assumed in the conventional picture of a hemispheric temperature seesaw."
https://openalex.org/W2109941804,"The HIV-1 genome contains several genes coding for auxiliary proteins, including the small Vpr protein. Vpr affects the integrity of the nuclear envelope and participates in the nuclear translocation of the preintegration complex containing the viral DNA. Here, we show by photobleaching experiments performed on living cells expressing a Vpr-green fluorescent protein fusion that the protein shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but a significant fraction is concentrated at the nuclear envelope, supporting the hypothesis that Vpr interacts with components of the nuclear pore complex. An interaction between HIV-1 Vpr and the human nucleoporin CG1 (hCG1) was revealed in the yeast two-hybrid system, and then confirmed both in vitro and in transfected cells. This interaction does not involve the FG repeat domain of hCG1 but rather the N-terminal region of the protein. Using a nuclear import assay based on digitonin-permeabilized cells, we demonstrate that hCG1 participates in the docking of Vpr at the nuclear envelope. This association of Vpr with a component of the nuclear pore complex may contribute to the disruption of the nuclear envelope and to the nuclear import of the viral DNA.

In contrast to oncoretroviruses that replicate only in dividing cells and enter the nucleus upon nuclear breakdown during mitosis, HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal; NE, nuclear envelope; Nup, nucleoporin; NPC, nuclear pore complex; PIC, preintegration complex; GFP, green fluorescent protein; aa, amino acid(s); FLIP, fluorescent loss in photobleaching; β-gal, β-galactosidase; DTT, dithiothreitol; BD, binding domain; AD, activation domain. and other lentiviruses have the ability to infect non-dividing cells, such as macrophages and quiescent T lymphocytes. After entry of the virus into the cell, the HIV capsid seems to uncoat rapidly. The genomic HIV-1 RNA is reverse transcribed into linear double-stranded DNA, which remains associated with a nucleoprotein complex, called the preintegration complex (PIC). The viral DNA is then imported into the nucleus through the nuclear envelope (NE) via an active mechanism within 4–6 h after infection (1Cullen B.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 20-21Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, the NE creates distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. This structure consists of two concentric membranes, the inner and outer nuclear membranes which are continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum. The NE is stabilized by the nuclear lamina, a tight meshwork of intermediate filament proteins underlying the inner nuclear membrane (for review, see Ref. 2Gruenbaum Y. Wilson K.L. Harel A. Goldberg M. Cohen M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 313-323Google Scholar), whereas on the outer side, cytoplasmic intermediate filaments in close contact with the nucleus serve to suspend the nucleus in the cytoplasm (3Maniotis A.J. Chen C.S. Ingber D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 849-854Google Scholar). Spanning both membranes are nuclear pore complexes (NPC) that form aqueous channels, which allow selective traffic between nucleus and cytoplasm and impose a permeability barrier to free diffusion of macromolecules or complexes. The NPC is a large supramolecular structure (4Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Google Scholar) formed of ∼30 unique proteins in vertebrates, termed nucleoporins (Nups) giving rise to an estimated molecular mass of 60 MDa (Ref. 5Cronshaw J.M. Krutchinsky A.N. Zhang W. Chait B.T. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 26: 315-327Google Scholar; for reviews, see Refs. 6Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16593-16596Google Scholar and 7Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Google Scholar). High resolution electron microscopic images of NPCs reveal an 8-fold symmetric structure, formed by nuclear and cytoplasmic rings and a central spoke complex. Peripheral filaments emanate from the core of the complex into the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. Although the cytoplasmic filaments spread outward, the nuclear filaments conjoin distally to form a basket-like structure (8Stoffler D. Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 391-401Google Scholar, 9Allen T.D. Cronshaw J.M. Bagley S. Kiseleva E. Goldberg M.W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1651-1659Google Scholar). This general architecture of NPCs is highly conserved between all eukaryotes, and many of the Nups are conserved across phyla (10Belgareh N. Doye V. Protoplasma. 1999; 209: 133-143Google Scholar). Genome analysis had revealed that half of the yeast nucleoporins contain phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats, either as FG, PSFG, FXFG, or GLFG repeats. Several lines of evidence indicate that these FG repeat-containing Nups organize into subcomplexes that form most of the filamentous structure emanating from the NPC (4Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Google Scholar, 11Buss F. Kent H. Stewart M. Bailer S.M. Hanover J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 631-638Google Scholar) and constitute the major sites of interaction for specific transport factors through the NPC (for reviews, see Refs. 7Ryan K.J. Wente S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 361-371Google Scholar and 12Conti E. Izaurralde E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 310-319Google Scholar). Thus, FG-Nups are proposed to function as stepping stones for cargoes and their transporters. Although the actual mechanism of protein transport through the NPC is not well understood, it likely corresponds to a stepwise process, wherein the nuclear localization or export signals (NLS or NES) present on the cargo protein are primarily recognized by a soluble transport receptor called importin or exportin (for reviews, see Refs. 6Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16593-16596Google Scholar and 13Ossareh-Nazari B. Gwizdek C. Dargemont C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 684-689Google Scholar). The cargo-transporter complex then docks at the NPC through association with FG-Nups before translocation to the opposite side where the cargo is released. A small GTPase, Ran, acts as a molecular switch that regulates the association of transport receptor with the cargoes (14Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Google Scholar). At least three proteins, namely the integrase, matrix protein, and the small auxiliary protein Vpr have been identified as possible mediators of the nuclear import of the HIV-1 PIC (for reviews, see Refs. 15Bukrinsky M.I. Haffar O.K. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D772-D781Google Scholar and16Fouchier R.A. Malim M.H. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 275-299Google Scholar). Furthermore, a structure within the viral DNA termed the central flap may also play a role during the nuclear entry of the PIC (17Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Google Scholar). The Vpr protein has been implicated in this process based on its karyophilic properties. In addition, the replication of a virus lacking the vpr gene is altered in non-dividing cells (18Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Google Scholar, 19Bukrinsky M.I. Sharova N. Dempsey M.P. Stanwick T.L. Bukrinskaya A.G. Haggerty S. Stevenson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6580-6584Google Scholar, 20Heinzinger N.K. Bukinsky M.I. Haggerty S.A. Ragland A.M. Kewalramani V. Lee M.A. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Stevenson M. Emerman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7311-7315Google Scholar). HIV-1 Vpr is a small basic protein (14 kDa), which is efficiently packaged into budding virus particles, and consequently is present in the cytoplasm of newly infected cells (21Bachand F. Yao X.J. Hrimech M. Rougeau N. Cohen E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9083-9091Google Scholar, 22Selig L. Pages J.C. Tanchou V. Preveral S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X. Erdtmann L. Darlix J. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 592-600Google Scholar). Following virus entry, Vpr interferes with the cell cycle to induce an arrest in the G2 phase (23Emerman M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1096-1103Google Scholar) and also participates in the nuclear translocation of the PIC (20Heinzinger N.K. Bukinsky M.I. Haggerty S.A. Ragland A.M. Kewalramani V. Lee M.A. Gendelman H.E. Ratner L. Stevenson M. Emerman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7311-7315Google Scholar, 24Gallay P. Stitt V. Mundy C. Oettinger M. Trono D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1027-1032Google Scholar). Although Vpr displays evident karyophilic properties, it does not contain any canonical basic NLS. It was initially suggested that Vpr could use an importin α-dependent pathway to access the nucleus (25Popov S. Rexach M. Ratner L. Blobel G. Bukrinsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13347-13352Google Scholar, 26Vodicka M.A. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Emerman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 175-185Google Scholar), but contradictory results have shown that Vpr nuclear import is promoted by an unidentified pathway, distinct from the classical NLS- and M9-dependent pathways (27Jenkins Y. McEntee M. Weis K. Greene W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 875-885Google Scholar). Thus, Vpr nuclear import occurs via two independent targeting signals, one spanning the helical domains found in the N-terminal part of the protein and the other within the arginine-rich C-terminal region (27Jenkins Y. McEntee M. Weis K. Greene W.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 875-885Google Scholar, 28Sherman M.P. de Noronha C.M. Heusch M.I. Greene S. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1522-1532Google Scholar). In addition, Vpr contains a leucine-rich NES that may use the CRM1-dependent pathway to be exported into the cytoplasm, supporting that Vpr is a shuttling protein (28Sherman M.P. de Noronha C.M. Heusch M.I. Greene S. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 1522-1532Google Scholar). Finally, a significant fraction of Vpr shows a nuclear rim staining coincident with the NE, indicating that it could interact with components of NPC (26Vodicka M.A. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. Emerman M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 175-185Google Scholar, 29Fouchier R.A. Meyer B.E. Simon J.H. Fischer U. Albright A.V. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6004-6013Google Scholar, 30Depienne C. Roques P. Creminon C. Fritsch L. Casseron R. Dormont D. Dargemont C. Benichou S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 387-395Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was recently reported by de Noronha and colleagues (31de Noronha C.M. Sherman M.P. Lin H.W. Cavrois M.V. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 294: 1105-1108Google Scholar) that Vpr expression can induce transient herniations in the NE, leading to local bursting and mixing of nuclear and cytoplasmic components, especially some key cell cycle regulators (31de Noronha C.M. Sherman M.P. Lin H.W. Cavrois M.V. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 294: 1105-1108Google Scholar). Using photobleaching experiments in living cells, we show here that Vpr rapidly shuttles between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, but also accumulates at the level of the NE. To characterize the molecular basis of this concentration to the NE, we analyzed the interaction between Vpr and components of the NPC. We reveal that HIV-1 Vpr directly interacts with the human nucleoporin hCG1. This interaction is required for the docking of Vpr at the NPC, and may provide a mechanism by which Vpr targets the PIC to the NPC or changes NE architecture. The vectors for expression of HIV-1 (Lai isolate) Vpr fused to LexA DNA binding domain (LexABD) and fused to Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD) have been previously described (32Selig L. Benichou S. Rogel M.E. Wu L.I. Vodicka M.A. Sire J. Benarous R. Emerman M. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4842-4846Google Scholar). The vectors for expression of the deleted form of Vpr have been previously described (33Bouhamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Google Scholar). The HIV-1 Rev coding sequence was isolated from the pEG202-Rev plasmid (34Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell.

Vectors for expression of nucleoporins (Rip1p, Nup1p, Nup2p, Nup49p, Nsp1p, Nup57p, Nup82p, Nup100p, Nup116p, Nup145p, Nup159p, hCG1, rNup98, rPOM121, hCAN, and Nup153) fused to the Gal4AD were obtained by inserting the EcoRI-XhoI fragments isolated from pJG4–5 constructs (34Stutz F.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Google Scholar) between the EcoRI andXhoI sites of pGAD-GE, except for the fragment encoding the POM121 FG repeat region, which was amplified by PCR. The plasmids for expression of the deletion mutants of hCG1 were constructed by PCR with specific primers, and the amplified products were inserted between theEcoRI and XhoI sites of pGAD-GE. The vectors for expression of full length and deleted forms of hCG1 fused to the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) were made by cloningEcoRI-XhoI fragments, isolated from pJG4–5 constructs (35Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Google Scholar) or from pGAD-GE (see below), into theEcoRI-XhoI sites of pGEX-4T1 (AmershamBiosciences). Vectors for expression of HA-tagged Vpr and Vpr-GFP were previously described (22Selig L. Pages J.C. Tanchou V. Preveral S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X. Erdtmann L. Darlix J. Benarous R. Benichou S.

The full-length coding sequence and the N-terminal region (aa 1–213) of hCG1 were cloned in frame with the Myc encoding tag into theEcoRI-XhoI sites of the pSC2 plasmid (36Roth M.B. Zahler A.M. Stolk J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 587-596Google Scholar). The L40 yeast reporter strain containing the two LexA-inducible genes, HIS3 and LacZ, was cotransformed with the indicated LexABD and Gal4AD hybrid expression vectors and plated on selective medium lacking tryptophan and leucine as reported (22Selig L. Pages J.C. Tanchou V. Preveral S. Berlioz-Torrent C. Liu L.X. Erdtmann L. Darlix J. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 592-600Google Scholar). Double transformants were patched on the same medium and replica plated on selective medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine for auxotrophy analysis and on Whatman 40 filters for β-galactosidase (β-gal) activity assay. This latter assay was monitored by incubation for 1 h to overnight at 30 °C, and the reaction was then stopped with 1 m Na2CO3. HeLa cells were maintained in exponential growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by electroporation as described (37Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Turpin P. Rodriguez M. Thomas D. Hay R.T. Virelizier J.L. Dargemont C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 369-378Google Scholar) and cultured subsequently for 18 h before analysis. Co-transfections of Vpr-GFP and Myc-hCG1 constructs were performed, respectively, with 12 and 8 μg of each expression plasmid and 20 μg of carrier DNA. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C in an humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with 7 μg of plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate method (38Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). 36 h after transfection with the Vpr-GFP expression vector, COS-7 cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 1 h. A Leica TCS-SP (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany) laser scanning confocal microscope with a 488-nm laser line from an argon laser (20 milliwatts) was used to perform all photobleaching experiments. The images were acquired, using wavelengths between 500 and 580 nm. In fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, a defined region of cells expressing Vpr-GFP was exposed to 100% laser intensity for 0.5–1 s. For quantitative analysis the post-bleach intensities were normalized to correct for total loss of fluorescence caused by photobleaching. The relative fluorescence intensity was calculated as (I B,t +I N,t)/I B,t,where I B,t is the fluorescence intensity of the bleached area at each time point andI N,t is the intensity of the unbleached area at the corresponding time points (39Lippincott-Schwartz J. Snapp E. Kenworthy A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 444-456Google Scholar). For fluorescent loss in photobleaching (FLIP) experiments, a defined region of cells expressing Vpr-GFP was repeatedly bleached for 1 s with 100% laser intensity and cells were imaged at low power between the bleach pulses. 18 h after transfection, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Alternatively, cells were permeabilized for 5 min at 4 °C with 55 μg/ml digitonin (Sigma) in transport buffer (40Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Google Scholar) and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Monoclonal antibody to Myc tag (9E10, Roche) was applied for 30 min followed by a 30-min incubation with Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson). Cells permeabilized with Triton X-100 were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst), whereas cells permeabilized with digitonin were mounted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50% glycerol. Images were acquired with a Leica DMRB epifluorescence microscope equipped with a CCD camera (Princeton) controlled by Metaview software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Chemically synthesized Vpr was kindly provided by B. Roques (41de Rocquigny H. Petitjean P. Tanchou V. Decimo D. Drouot L. Delaunay T. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30753-30759Google Scholar) and was labeled with FITC as described previously (42Depienne C. Mousnier A. Leh H. Le Rouzic E. Dormont D. Benichou S. Dargemont C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18102-18107Google Scholar). For expression of the Nter and FG-containing region of hCG1 fused to GST,Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed and expression of recombinant protein was induced with 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 30 °C. Bacterial pellets were then washed with 0.9% NaCl, frozen at −80 °C, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT and protease inhibitors (aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, Pefabloc). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C with 0.12% lysozyme, bacterial lysis was completed by adding 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2 and 20 μg/ml DNase I. Lysates were centrifuged at 60,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of 150 mm NaCl. Beads were washed with 10 mmHepes, pH 8, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. GST-hCG1-FG and GST-hCG1-Nter fusions were eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 10 mm Hepes, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The proteins were concentrated using Centricon 30 K (Amicon) and buffer-exchanged into transport buffer. The concentration of the fusion proteins was estimated on a SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Blue relatively to a range of bovine serum albumin standard. 6 × 106 HeLa cells expressing HA-Vpr were lysed for 10 min on ice in a buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and an antiprotease mixture (Sigma). Equal quantities of GST-hCG1, GST-hCG1-Nter, and GST purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with 1 ml of cell lysates overnight at 4 °C. Beads were extensively washed in lysis buffer and resuspended in 2× sample buffer. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond P, AmershamBiosciences). The membrane was saturated for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 and then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in the saturation solution. The membrane was then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20, and the proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa cells expressing HA-Vpr and Myc-hCG1 were lysed on ice for 10 min in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and an antiprotease mixture (Sigma) and set up on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 rpm, 3 μl of anti-HA (clone 3F10, Roche) or anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Roche) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the antibodies were collected by binding to protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. After three washes with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond P, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were treated and revealed as described above. Nuclear import assay was performed as described previously (30Depienne C. Roques P. Creminon C. Fritsch L. Casseron R. Dormont D. Dargemont C. Benichou S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 387-395Google Scholar) with 2 μg/ml Vpr-FITC. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 30 °C. Competition experiments were performed using a 15-fold excess of GST-hCG1-FG or GST-hCG1-Nter. Images were acquired with a Leica DMRB epifluorescence microscope as indicated previously. We have previously shown that Vpr is mainly distributed into the nucleus at steady state, but also displays a nuclear rim staining coincident with the NE (30Depienne C. Roques P. Creminon C. Fritsch L. Casseron R. Dormont D. Dargemont C. Benichou S. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 260: 387-395Google Scholar). To study the dynamic properties of Vpr in living cells, we used confocal microscopy and fluorescence photobleaching techniques on COS-7 cells expressing Vpr fused to GFP at its C terminus. Before bleaching (Fig.1 A, prebleach), the Vpr-GFP fusion was distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm, but was also concentrated around the nuclear rim. When bleached either in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm, the fluorescence recovered immediately, indicating free diffusion of soluble Vpr-GFP in these compartments (data not shown). In contrast, when bleached at the nuclear rim, the complete recovery of the fluorescence in the area was reached within 30 min (Fig. 1, A and B). This FRAP experiment shows that Vpr-GFP is dynamically associated with the NE and is able to exchange with soluble Vpr-GFP and/or Vpr-GFP associated to adjacent areas of the NE. We then performed FLIP experiments to analyze the range of the dynamic distribution of Vpr-GFP in the cell. As shown in Fig. 1 C, repeated bleaching in a defined spot in the cytoplasm resulted in a rapid decrease of the fluorescence intensity in both the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm, indicating that Vpr-GFP actively shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In addition, the fluorescence at the nuclear rim was also quenched by cytoplasmic bleaching, but at a slower rate because fluorescence was still associated with the NE after a 10-min period of continuous bleaching. These results demonstrate a dynamic equilibrium between the cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic soluble fractions of Vpr-GFP and the fraction associated with the NE. They strongly suggest that Vpr reversibly interacts with one or more components of the NPC either directly or indirectly via transport factors. To examine the ability of Vpr to interact with components of the NPC, we used a two-hybrid assay to test several different yeast and mammalian Nups. The Vpr protein from the HIV-1 Lai isolate was fused to the LexABD and analyzed for interaction with Nups fused to the Gal4AD in the L40 yeast strain containing the two LexA-inducible reporter genes, LacZ and HIS3. We used LexA-Rev fusion as a positive control. The HIV-1 Rev protein interacts with the FG repeat domains of multiple Nups in the two-hybrid assay; these interactions are bridged by the endogenous yeast export receptor Crm1p (34Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Mattaj I.W. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7144-7150Google Scholar, 43Neville M. Stutz F. Lee L. Davis L.I. Rosbash M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 767-775Google Scholar). Among all the Nups tested, only the human CG1 (hCG1) protein reacted with Vpr, as revealed by growth on medium without histidine and the expression of the β-gal activity (Fig.2, left panels). This interaction was specific, because there was no transcriptional activation of the reporter genes in yeast cells expressing LexABD-Vpr or Gal4AD-hCG1 alone (Fig. 2 and data not shown) or in combination with irrelevant hybrid proteins (data not shown). Moreover, we did not detect any interaction between Vpr and the yeast functional homologue of hCG1, Rip1p (35Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Google Scholar). Rip1p and hCG1 display 55% homology over their entire sequence but show a 35% identity over the C-terminal 40 aa (35Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Google Scholar). The Vpr-hCG1 interaction is probably mediated by a non-conserved region between Rip1p and hCG1 (see below). In contrast to previously published results (29Fouchier R.A. Meyer B.E. Simon J.H. Fischer U. Albright A.V. Gonzalez-Scarano F. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6004-6013Google Scholar), we did not detect any interaction between Vpr and FG repeat region of POM121 (Fig. 2). All the nucleoporins, including Rip1p and POM121, were efficiently expressed in yeast because they gave positive signals in the presence of the LexA-Rev fusion (Fig.2, right panel). To identify the region of hCG1 responsible for the interaction with Vpr, deleted forms of hCG1 were constructed and analyzed in the two-hybrid assay. hCG1 is a 423-aa-long protein, which is organized in three distinct regions (see Fig.3 A): (i) the N-terminal region, which contains both a putative zinc finger motif and a coiled-coil domain (44Farjot G. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17309-17317Google Scholar); (ii) a central region extending from aa 213 to 380 and containing nine FG repeats; and (iii) the 43-residue-long C-terminal domain, which shows significant identity with the yeast Rip1p protein (35Strahm Y. Fahrenkrog B. Zenklusen D. Rychner E. Kantor J. Rosbach M. Stutz F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Google Scholar). These three distinct regions were first fused to the Gal4AD and assayed for the interaction with the LexABD-Vpr hybrid proteins in the L40 strain. As indicated in Fig. 3 A, only the deletion mutant containing the N-terminal region of hCG1 bound to Vpr. In contrast, the FG repeat-containing region interacted only with Rev, whereas the C-terminal domain failed to interact with both Vpr and Rev. These results are consistent with our previous data indicating the absence of an interaction between Vpr and the yeast homolog of hCG1, Rip1p, because their N-terminal regions are the less well conserved between the two proteins. Different deleted forms encompassing the N-terminal part of hCG1 were then analyzed to precisely delineate the Vpr-binding region (Fig. 3 A). Specific deletion of the regions containing the putative zinc finger (ΔZF) or the coiled-coil domain (ΔCC) of hCG1 did not suppress the interaction with Vpr. In contrast, an internal deletion mutant (Δ64–170), which lacks the region between the ZF and the coiled-coil domain, completely failed to bind Vpr, although this mutant was still able to interact with Rev. Finally, the minimal region of hCG1 able to interact with Vpr was delineated between residues 94 and 170 of the protein. This domain of hCG1 does not show any significant homology with other known sequences and/or motifs in the GenBankTMdata base. From the structural analysis of Vpr, four regions have been defined within the protein (45Wecker K. Roques B.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 359-369Google Scholar, 46Schuler W. Wecker K. de Rocquigny H. Baudat Y. Sire J. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2105-2117Google Scholar): (i) an unfolded N-terminal region (aa 1–16), (ii) a first amphipathic region containing a long α-helix-turn"

Features of alphavirus infection include an increased permeability of cells to monovalent cations followed by virion budding. Virally encoded ion channels are thought to have a role in these processes. In this paper, the 6K proteins of Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus are shown to form cation-selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers. Using a novel purification method, bacterially expressed 6K proteins were inserted into bilayers with a defined orientation (i.e.N-terminal cis, C-terminal trans). Channel activity was reversibly inhibited by antibodies to the N and C termini of 6K protein added to the cis and trans baths, respectively. Channel conductances varied from 40–800 picosiemens, suggesting that the protein is able to form channels with a range of possible oligomerization states.

Members of the Alphavirus genus include a number of medically significant pathogens: Western, Eastern, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses, Chikungunya virus, O'nyong-nyong fever virus, Sindbis and Semliki Forest viruses (SFV) (on which most of the extensive molecular characterization of alphaviruses is based), Ross River virus (RRV), 1The abbreviations used are: RRV, Ross River virus; BFV, Barmah Forest virus; CHAPS, (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate); GST, Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine; PE, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylserine; SFV, Semliki Forest virus; SINV, Sindbis virus; TES, 2-([2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]amino)ethanesulfonic acid); TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline 1The abbreviations used are: RRV, Ross River virus; BFV, Barmah Forest virus; CHAPS, (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate); GST, Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine; PE, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylserine; SFV, Semliki Forest virus; SINV, Sindbis virus; TES, 2-([2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]amino)ethanesulfonic acid); TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline and Barmah Forest virus (BFV). The latter two viruses are the etiological agents of epidemic polyarthritis in Australia. Alphaviruses have an approx. 11.7 kb single-stranded RNA genome of positive sense. The 5′ end (7.6 kb) encodes components involved in genomic replication and mRNA synthesis. The 3′ end (4.1 kb) encodes the structural proteins of the virus. The structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic mRNA as a single polyprotein in the order capsid-PE2–6K-E1. The polyprotein is cotranslationally translocated across the ER membrane. Signal sequences alternating with stop-transfer (anchor) sequences direct the topology of the polyprotein with respect to the ER membrane (1Liljestrom P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Google Scholar). Cleavage occurs via cellular proteases and the autoprotease activity of the capsid protein to generate the viral capsid and membrane proteins (2Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Google Scholar). Alphavirus 6K proteins are small (58–61 amino acids), hydrophobic, and associate with membranes (3Welch W.J. Sefton B.M. J. Virol. 1980; 33: 230-237Google Scholar). The function of 6K protein in the virus life cycle is not fully understood. However, the 6K protein of SFV has been shown to function as a stop-transfer peptide sequence for the insertion of the E1 protein into the ER membrane (1Liljestrom P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Google Scholar). Additionally, expression of 6K protein causes an increase in membrane permeability inEscherichia coli and enhances both membrane permeability and viral budding in eukaryotic cells (4–8.) On the basis of these observations and structural similarity with other small virus proteins, it has been suggested that the 6K protein is a virally encoded ion channel (viroporin) (9Carrasco L. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 61-93Google Scholar). Viroporins are short (50–120 amino acids), integral membrane proteins that enhance membrane permeability in infected cells (9Carrasco L. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 61-93Google Scholar). Viroporins have been shown to affect glycoprotein processing, transport of proteins through the ER, and virion budding (6Loewy A.

Other proteins identified as viroporins include the M2 protein of influenza A (14Guinea R. Carrasco L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 242-246Google Scholar, 15Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Google Scholar), the NB protein of influenza B (16Sunstrom N.A. Premkumar L.S. Premkumar A. Ewart G. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. J. Membr.

Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Google Scholar, 16Sunstrom N.A. Premkumar L.S. Premkumar A. Ewart G. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 150: 127-132Google Scholar, 17Ewart G.D. Sutherland T. Gage P.W.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 111-115Google Scholar). Of these four proteins, M2 is the only one for which the role of the ion channel activity in the physiological functions of the protein is understood (22Hay A.J. Semin. Virol. 1992; 3: 21-30Google Scholar). The topology of the structural proteins of SFV has been determined byin vitro translation-translocation assay (1Liljestrom P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Google Scholar). The results obtained were consistent with the 6K protein crossing the membrane twice (1Liljestrom P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Google Scholar). However, prediction of transmembrane regions by the method of Sonnhammer et al. (23Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182Google Scholar) suggests that all mature alphavirus 6K proteins cross the membrane only once (see Fig.1 B) (23Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182Google Scholar). In this paper, we present evidence that the 6K protein spans the membrane once when reconstituted in vesicles or incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. We show that purified, recombinant 6K proteins from both BFV and RRV form cation-selective ion channels when inserted into planar lipid bilayers. Antibodies specific for each 6K species were found to inhibit channel activity. Additionally, the site-directed mutation of serine 32 to proline (S32P) in BFV 6K protein resulted in altered ionic selectivity of the channel. A synthetic peptide, corresponding to the amino acid sequence of BFV 6K protein (B6Kpep), also makes ion channels with similar properties. The coding sequence for the BFV 6K gene was amplified from a BFV cDNA clone (24Lee E. Stocks C. Lobigs P. Hislop A. Straub J. Marshall I. Weir R. Dalgarno L. Virology. 1997; 227: 509-514Google Scholar), which contained the 6K gene region using the primers 98–16 (5′-cgcgggatccgacactttagatgat), which introduces aBamHI site (underlined) and 98–17 (5′-attactcgagtcaggcctgcgtggcaa), which introduces aXhoI site (underlined). The coding sequence for the RRV 6K gene was amplified from a cDNA genomic clone of RRV strain T48 (25Kuhn R.J. Niesters H.G. Hong Z. Strauss J.H. Virology. 1991; 182: 430-441Google Scholar). Primers used were 98–14 (5′-cgagggatccgcatcattcgctgag), which introduces aBamHI site (underlined) and 98–55 (5′-gccgctcgagtcaagcttttgcggagg), which introduces aXhoI a site (underlined). PCR was performed with 0.035 units/μl native Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) in a Corbett Research FTS-1 capillary thermocycler with the following parameters: one cycle of 94 °C for 2 min; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 30 s; and one cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. PCR product size was confirmed by electrophoresis on 2% TAE (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mmEDTA)-agarose gels (6 V/cm, 1 h) followed by ethidium bromide staining (50 μg/ml) and photography (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR products were gel-purified (QIAquick gel extraction kit; Qiagen), digested with restriction enzymes (BamHI followed by XhoI), and ligated into the vector p2GEX (21Piller S.C. Ewart G.D. Premkumar A. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 111-115Google Scholar), which had also beenBamHI/XhoI-digested and 5′-dephosphorylated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase. The plasmid p2GEX is based on pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), and contains an additional copy of the Schistosoma japonicumGST cDNA designed to express an unfused copy of GST. Previous observations from this laboratory suggest that the co-expression of free (unconjugated) GST in addition to the GST fusion from the same plasmid can enhance cytoplasmic yields of largely insoluble GST fusion proteins (17Ewart G.D. Sutherland T. Gage P.W. Cox G.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7108-7115Google Scholar, 21Piller S.C. Ewart G.D. Premkumar A. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 111-115Google Scholar). E. coli strain XL1 Blue (Stratagene) was used as a transformation host for subsequent plasmid maintenance and site-directed mutagenesis (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To create a mutation from serine to proline at position 32 of BFV 6K (named BFV 6K S32P) recombinant PCR was used (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The two primary amplifications were carried out with primers 98–16/98–18 and 98–19/98–17, respectively (98–19 = 5′-gtgcttaccctattgct; 98–18 = 5′-agcaatagggtaagcac). Thermocyling parameters were: one cycle of 94 °C for 3 min; five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 30 s, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s. Primary PCR products were gel-purified as described above, and 10 ng of each used as template in the secondary reaction (parameters used were: one cycle of 94 °C for 3 min, five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 37 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 30 s, 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 30 s. The secondary PCR product was digested withBamHI/XhoI, ligated into p2GEX, and transformed into E. coli XLI Blue as described above. All constructs were confirmed by restriction mapping and dideoxy nucleotide sequencing. E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Stratagene) was transformed with each construct. Luria broth cultures (500 ml, 37 °C) were grown from a 1:10 dilution of overnight cultures, and growth was monitored byA 600. Expression was induced by the addition of IPTG to 1 mm at A 600 = 1.6. Cultures were grown for 10–25 min, placed on ice for 10 min, and harvested by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of “membrane” buffer (1% CHAPS, 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors at the concentrations specified by the manufacturer (CompleteTM, Boehringer), and passed through a cell fractionator (Sorvall). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (4000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was added to 2 ml of glutathione-conjugated bead slurry (Stratagene). The tube was rotated at 4 °C overnight to allow binding of GST-containing proteins to the beads. After extensive washing with membrane buffer, the beads were transferred to a column (1.5-cm diameter), and proteins eluted by drop-wise addition of membrane buffer containing 100 mm reduced glutathione. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). GST-6K fusion protein was inserted into vesicles as described previously (17Ewart G.D. Sutherland T. Gage P.W. Cox G.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7108-7115Google Scholar,21Piller S.C. Ewart G.D. Premkumar A. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 111-115Google Scholar, 28New R.R.C. Liposomes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1990: 33-104Google Scholar). Vesicle formation was facilitated by removal (via dialysis) of detergent from a protein/lipid/detergent mixture. Briefly, lipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylserine (PS) (Avanti Polar Lipids) supplied in CHCl3 were combined in the mass ratio PE:PC:PS = 3:1:1 and dried under a stream of N2 gas. Purified fusion protein (0.1 mg/mg total lipid) in membrane buffer supplemented with 400 mg/ml CHAPS was added to the dried lipids, and the mixture was bath sonicated (10 min, 20–25 °C). The resulting solution was then transferred into dialysis tubing (5000 molecular weight cut-off) and dialyzed against 10 mm TES/200 mm NaCl, pH 7.0 or 8.0, (1 × 1 h, 1l; 1× overnight 1l, 20–25 °C). Fusion protein-containing vesicles were incubated in the presence of 1–5 units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences, 1 unit/μl) for 5–16 h to cleave the GST fusion tag from the 6K protein. GST and uncut fusion protein were removed by incubation with glutathione-conjugated beads (2 h, 20–25 °C). Thrombin was removed by adsorption to barium citrate (29Board P.G. Shaw D.C. Br. J. Haematol. 1983; 54: 245-254Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of 0.109 m sodium citrate was added to 305 μl of 10 mm TES/200 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Solid BaCl2 was added (15 mg) while vortexing. A cloudy precipitate of barium citrate forms to which thrombin binds. The precipitate and bound thrombin were removed by centrifugation. Following centrifugation, thrombin was undetectable in the supernatant by SDS-PAGE with silver staining or Western blot with anti-prothrombin antibodies. Peptides corresponding to the 20 N-terminal residues of BFV 6K (CDTLDDFSYLWTNNQAMFWLQ), the 20 C-terminal residues of BFV 6K (CACCMKIFLGISGLCVIATQA), the 20 N-terminal residues of RRV 6K (CASFAETMAYLWDENKTLFWM), and the 20 C-terminal residues of RRV 6K (CCCCKPFSFLVLLSLGASAKA) were synthesized manually using Boc chemistry in the Biomolecular Resource Facility at the John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University. Multiple antigenic peptides were prepared by coupling peptides to a polylysine core via their terminal cysteine residues (30Lu Y.A. Clavijo P. Galantino M. Shen Z.Y. Liu W. Tam J.P. Mol. Immunol. 1991; 28: 623-630Google Scholar). The multiple antigenic peptides were used to immunize individual New Zealand White rabbits for the production of polyclonal antisera against peptides representing the N terminus of BFV 6K (α-B6N), the C terminus of BFV 6K, the N terminus of RRV 6K (α-R6N), and the C terminus of RRV 6K (α-R6C). Initial immunization was in Freund's complete adjuvant and subsequent booster immunizations at 3 and 5 weeks were in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Blood samples (10 ml) were collected by ear vein canulation at 6, 8, and 10 weeks postimmunization. Antisera were assayed for specificity by dot-blot analysis using unconjugated peptides. Affinity chromatography was used to purify antibodies from antisera. Briefly, peptides were dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl/10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol, desalted, (NAD desalting column), and covalently linked to SulfoLink™ columns (Pierce). Columns were gradually returned to more physiological conditions by sequential washing with PBS containing decreasing amounts of guanidine hydrochloride. Antisera were applied to the columns, and after thorough washing, specific antibodies eluted using 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. The 58-mer peptide (DTLDDFSYLWTNNQAMFWLQLASPVAAFLCLSYCCRNLACCMKIFLGISGLCVIATQA) corresponding to the amino acid sequence of BFV 6K (referred to hereafter as B6Kpep) was synthesized manually using Boc chemistry in the Biomolecular Resource Facility at the John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University. B6Kpep was dissolved in 50% trifluoroethanol/2 m guanidine isothiocyanate, and dialyzed into membrane buffer containing 1 m guanidine isothiocyanate. Peptide refolding was achieved by dialysis into membrane buffer, and purification was by gel filtration high pressure liquid chromatography with a BioRad BioSilect SEC400 column with detection by at 280 nm. Mass spectroscopy, dot-blot, and Western analyses were used to confirm the identity of the eluted protein (data not shown). Proteins were transferred from polyacrylamide gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with a semi-dry apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). Nonspecific protein binding sites on the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked in 10% (w/v) skim milk proteins in PBS with 0.5% Tween 20 (TPBS). Primary antibodies were either rabbit antisera (1:100), or affinity purified antibodies in 10% (w/v) skim milk proteins in TPBS. The secondary antibody was a goat-raised anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate added in PBS (Sigma), and color development was with Western Blue-stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase (Promega). Protein estimation was using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce, kit form) in a 96-well plate. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was used to create standard curves. A Bio-Rad model 450 microplate reader was used to measure absorbance at 570 nm, with background at 405 nm subtracted. N-terminal protein sequencing was with an Applied Biosystems 477A machine in the Biomolecular Resource Facility, John Curtin School of Medical Research. Vesicles containing purified 6K protein were fused with lipid bilayers using standard techniques described previously (17Ewart G.D. Sutherland T. Gage P.W. Cox G.B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7108-7115Google Scholar, 21Piller S.C. Ewart G.D. Premkumar A. Cox G.B. Gage P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 111-115Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids (PE/PC/PS; 3:1:1) supplied in CHCl3 were dried under a stream of N2 gas, resuspended in n-decane to 50 mg/ml, and painted over a 120–180-μm diameter circular hole in a Delrin cup. Bath solutions contained:trans, 60 mm NaCl, 10 mm TES, pH 7.0 or 8.0, total volume 1 ml; and cis, 10 mm TES with 510 mm NaCl or 500 mm KCl or 500 mm CaCl2 each buffered to pH 7.0 or 8.0, total volume 1.3 ml. Currents were measured via AgCl-coated silver wire electrodes without agar bridges. This can potentially result in large changes in the junction potential at the electrodes during experiments (e.g. if the AgCl coating of the electrode becomes chipped). To control for this possibility, the current between cis andtrans bath solutions was clamped, and the voltage offset adjusted to zero prior to painting a bilayer. At the conclusion of every experiment the bilayer was broken, and the current immediately clamped to zero. If the potential difference between chambers was greater than 10 mV the experiment was discarded. After a good bilayer had been established, vesicles containing 6K protein were added to thecis bath. The bath solution was stirred until channel activity was observed. Potential was controlled and current recorded with an Axopatch 200A amplifier. Currents were filtered at 500 Hz, digitized at 44 kHz (Sony PCM 100), and stored on magnetic tape with a video cassette recorder. For analysis, currents were replayed through the same system in reverse, filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized at 2 or 5 kHz by using an A-to-D converter interfaced with a desktop personal computer. The cis bath was grounded, and voltages are expressed as trans potential relative to cis. Reversal potentials were determined by changing the holding potential in 2–10 mV steps and observing the direction of the currents. For channel inhibition experiments, antibody was added in small aliquots (<5 μl; 14 μg/μl), and bath solutions were stirred for 1 min before recording any effects. The cis bath was set up to enable perfusion by a pair of back-to-back syringes connected to tubing the ends of which could be lowered into the cis bath. Ion activities for each species were calculated from the total ionic strength, I, using the Guy-Chapman “Limiting Law” (31Margolis M.J. Chemical Principles in Calculation of Ionic Equilibria. Macmillan, New York1966: 270Google Scholar). This could not be used for the CaCl2 solution because the ionic strength was too high. Therefore, Ca2+ activities were determined using a calcium-selective electrode (which gave a linear response in the range of CaCl2 concentrations used in the bilayer experiments). Relative ionic permeabilities were determined from reversal potential data and ionic activities. Reversal potentials were determined as described above and corrected for liquid junction potential effects. Liquid junction potentials for differing bath solutions can be calculated using the Henderson equation (32Barry P.H. Lynch J.W. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 121: 101-117Google Scholar). The junction potential for a given pair of dissimilar bath solutions was determined by measuring the voltage difference (without a bilayer present) between the cis andtrans baths of the bilayer apparatus. This voltage was measured relative to that obtained from symmetric solutions (i.e. when the liquid junction potential equals zero). The potential difference between the two baths (when the current was clamped to zero) was measured with a 4 m KCl-containing agar bridge electrode. Experimentally measured values were not found to deviate by more than 2 mV from those predicted by the Henderson equation. As the Henderson equation is only valid for monovalent species, the liquid junction potential for the Ca2+-containing cis solution was determined experimentally. Once corrected for liquid junction potentials, the sum of the currents from all ionic species is zero at the reversal potential, and the constant field equation can be solved. The ionic activities of the species present (see above for calculation) were used in conjunction with corrected reversal potential data to iteratively solve the constant field equation for I = 0 as described previously (33Goldman D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1943; 27: 37-60Google Scholar). Firstly, the PNa+/ PCl−ratio was determined for each channel species by optimizing the constant field equation to obtain the Na+ permeability (bath conditions for cis: 510 mm NaCl, 10 mm TES, pH 7.0, and for trans: 60 mmNaCl, 10 mm TES pH 7.0). PNa+/ PCl−was assumed to remain constant in the presence of other ions (i.e. when determining K+ and Ca2+permeabilities). The TES anion was assumed not to permeate the channel. For calculating ionic activities in the CaCl2 solutions, Ca2+ activity was determined as described above, and the activity of Cl− was derived from a table of mean activity coefficients for CaCl2 at a range of molalities (34Staples B.R. Nuttall R.L. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1977; 6: 385-407Google Scholar). As the mean activity coefficient of a salt solution is the geometrical mean of the activity coefficients of its component ions, the activity of Cl− in a CaCl2 solution could be derived. Purified, recombinant 6K proteins of RRV and BFV were produced after expression in E. coli with N-terminal glutathioneS-transferase tags. The cDNA fragments encoding the RRV or BFV 6K proteins were cloned into the vector p2GEX (described under “Experimental Procedures”), and optimal expression and purification methods were determined. Alphavirus 6K proteins contain a large proportion of hydrophobic residues (see Fig. 1) and have been shown to interact with membranes in virus-infected cells (1Liljestrom P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Google Scholar,3Welch W.J. Sefton B.M. J. Virol. 1980; 33: 230-237Google Scholar, 35Garoff H. Huylebroeck D. Robinson A. Tillman U. Liljestrom P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 867-876Google Scholar). To examine potential toxicity of the RRV and BFV 6K proteins inE. coli, we monitored the growth of cultures expressing GST-6K fusion proteins. Induction of GST-6K expression with IPTG rapidly led to arrest of E. coli cell growth. Cultures ofE. coli expressing RR 6K fusion protein, induced during the log phase of growth, continued to grow for only 10 min postinduction (Fig. 2). In contrast, control cultures (uninduced or expressing unfused GST from p2GEX) continued to grow for over 2 h (p2GEX not shown for clarity). Fig. 2 shows combined results from seven induced cultures expressing RRV 6K compared with five uninduced cultures. Similar depression of growth was observed inE. coli expressing BFV 6K protein (data not shown). This indicates that expression of the 6K fusion protein inhibits growth ofE. coli and is consistent with the findings of Sanz et al. (4Sanz M.A. Perez L. Carrasco L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12106-12110Google Scholar) that SFV 6K protein enhances membrane permeability in bacteria. GST-6K fusion proteins of BFV and RRV were purified fromE. coli extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” SDS-PAGE was used to assess the efficiency of different steps throughout purification. Coomassie staining of extracts from bacteria expressing RRV GST-6K that had been purified on glutathione columns revealed the major constituents to be proteins of molecular masses 28 kDa and 34 kDa (Fig.3 A). The 28-kDa protein was immunoreactive to anti-GST antibodies on a Western blot (not shown) and represents “free” GST expressed from the unfused copy of the gene in the expression plasmid. The 34-kDa protein was also immunoreactive with anti-GST antibodies, and its size corresponds to that expected for the RRV GST-6K fusion protein. Surprisingly, the 34-kDa protein was not recognized by polyclonal antibodies raised against the N-terminal 20 amino acids of RRV 6K. Rather, a single protein of a molecular mass of ∼32 kDa was immunoreactive to the anti-RRV 6K N-terminal antibodies (Fig. 3 B). The 32-kDa protein was of much lower abundance than the 34-kDa protein and most likely represents a truncated form of the RRV 6K fusion protein. Unfused GST was present in about 16-fold excess compared with the full-length protein (determined by Coomassie staining of serial dilutions of the RRV GST-6K fusion protein, data not shown). Fusion protein expression was thereby calculated to be ∼1.7 mg/liter of LB culture after bicinchoninic acid assay of total protein (data not shown). Similar results and yields were obtained from cells expressing the BFV GST-6K fusion protein, except that no truncated protein was detected. Attempts to cleave either BFV GST-6K or RRV GST-6K in detergent-containing extracts were unsuccessful despite modification of the following parameters: amount of thrombin present (0.05–0.5 units/μl), incubation time (2–72 h), temperature (4–50 °C), or the presence of up to 30% organic solvent (TFE or acetonitrile). However, it was possible to cleave both RRV GST-6K and BFV GST-6K if the fusion proteins were associated with lipid vesiclesprior to the addition of thrombin. The final purification step yields protein-containing vesicles that appear on silver-stained SDS gels as a single protein of 5.8 kDa for both RRV 6K and BFV 6K (Fig. 3, Cand D, respectively). N-terminal sequencing of the 5.8-kDa protein prepared from RRV 6K fusion revealed the first seven amino acids to be identical to those expected of wild-type RRV 6K protein. The 5.8-kDa protein band from the BFV 6K preparation was not sequenced. Uncut fusion protein, GST, and other protein contaminants were undetectable by silver staining (Fig.3 C, lane 3and Fig. 3 D, lane 3) or Western blot (not shown). Thus the final preparation was deemed to be a homogeneous collection of RRV or BFV"

In eukaryotes, the heat-shock response and some developmental processes are under the control of a family of conserved DNA-binding proteins known as the heat-shock transcription factors (HSFs). 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat-shock factor; sHSP(s), small heat-shock protein(s); HSE, heat-shock element; DBD, DNA-binding domain; HR, hydrophobic heptad repeats; AHA, aromatic, large hydrophobic and acidic amino acid motif; dpi, days post-imbibition; dpa, days post-anthesis; m, mutant; WT, wild type; P, Perfect 1The abbreviations used are: HSF, heat-shock factor; sHSP(s), small heat-shock protein(s); HSE, heat-shock element; DBD, DNA-binding domain; HR, hydrophobic heptad repeats; AHA, aromatic, large hydrophobic and acidic amino acid motif; dpi, days post-imbibition; dpa, days post-anthesis; m, mutant; WT, wild type; P, PerfectAlthough in some systems, as in Drosophila melanogaster, this regulation involves a single HSF (1Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), multigenic families of HSFs participate in vertebrate and in plant systems. These families have different sizes, which, together with particular gene expression and activation patterns for the HSFs, might have consequences in the degree of overlapping of regulatory functions mediated by these factors. The specific role of the different HSFs is mostly unknown, particularly for the plant HSFs, and for involvement in developmental processes, as the regulation of gene expression during embryogenesis (See for example, Ref. 2Rallu M.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrate systems, three different HSFs (HSF1, HSF2, and HSF3) have ubiquitous expression patterns (for example, Refs. 5Fiorenza M.T. Farkas T. Dissing M. Kolding D. Zimarino V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 467-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar and 6Mathew A. Mathur S.K. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

A fourth HSF found in humans displays tissue-specific expression patterns, which suggested specialized functions but not related to embryogenesis (HSF4, Ref. 7Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Liu X.D. Liu P.C. Thiele D.J. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27845-27856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Plants contain the highest number of HSF genes in eukaryotes. This is inferred from in silico analyses from the fully sequencedArabidopsis thaliana model and from functional analyses of different cloned HSFs in tomato, Arabidopsis, and other plants (reviewed in Refs. 4Nover L. Bharti K. Döring P. Mishra S.K. Ganguli A. Scharf K.D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 8Schöffl F. Prändl R. Reindl A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar and references therein). Plant HSFs share unique structural and phylogenetic relationships compared with the vertebrate HSFs (9Nover L. Scharf K.D. Gagliardi D. Vergne P. Czarnecka V.E. Gurley W.B. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fifteen of the 21 putative HSFs from A. thaliana thus contain an insertion of 21 amino acid residues in the oligomerization domain (characteristic of the plant class A HSFs), whereas class B HSFs have no such insertion. Gene expression studies for plant HSFs are very scarce, with only fragmentary data at the mRNA level and even scarcer reports for protein accumulation (also reviewed in Refs. 4Nover L. Bharti K. Döring P. Mishra S.K. Ganguli A. Scharf K.D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 8Schöffl F. Prändl R. Reindl A. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar and references therein). The potential higher specialization of plant HSFs, compared with vertebrate animal systems, is thus mostly unexplored. Observations from our laboratory indicated the involvement of peculiar HSF(s) and HSE(s) in developmental regulation and of small heat-shock protein (sHSP) gene expression during zygotic embryogenesis in sunflower and other plant systems (10Carranco R. Almoguera C. Jordano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27470-27475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Almoguera C. Prieto D.P. Jordano J. Plant J. 1998; 13: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Rojas A. Almoguera C. Carranco C. Scharf K.D. Jordano J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 1207-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we exploited these observations to clone by one-hybrid interaction in yeast HaHSFA9, a class A HSF with a unique embryo-specific gene expression pattern. We show that HaHSFA9 trans-activates two sHSP gene promoters (Hahsp17.7G4 and Hahsp17.6G1), the latter of which is embryo-specific, and that transcriptional regulation by HaHSFA9 in sunflower embryos depends on particular characteristics of the DNA sequences used for cloning (imperfect consensus HSE sequences). We extend similar observations to other endogenous HSFs in transgenic tobacco; thus, we demonstrate the involvement of at least a specialized HSF for sHSP gene regulation during sunflower (and perhaps other plant) embryogenesis. mRNA from 14 dpa sunflower embryos (Helianthus annuus, cv. P113HS, seeds from ARLESA Semillas S.A., Spain) was isolated from total RNA using the Poly(A) QuikR mRNA Isolation kit (Stratagene). We used 5 μg of poly(A) for cDNA synthesis performed with the ZAP-cDNAR Kit (Stratagene). The cDNA, which included 5′ EcoRI adapters, was digested with XhoI. This generated the 3′-cloning site. The digested cDNA was size-fractionated with SizeSepTM 400-Sepharose CL-4B spun columns (AmershamBiosciences), and directionally inserted within the EcoRI and SalI sites in the polylinker of the pGAD424 vector (Clontech). The primary cDNA library contained 830,000 individual transformants, all with a cDNA insert of average size of 1.3 kb. General methods for one-hybrid cloning and related experimental manipulations in yeast were as described (13Meijer A.H. Schouten J. Ouwerkerk P.B.F. Hoge J.H.C. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.A. Verma D.P.S. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2000: 1-28Crossref Google Scholar). We constructed a yeast strain derivative of YM4271 (Clontech). In this strain, we integrated aHIS3 reporter gene construct ((G4HSE I)x3::HIS3) containing a trimer of the proximal HSE sequences from Ha hsp17.7 G4 (from positions −89 to −57, see Ref. 11Almoguera C. Prieto D.P. Jordano J. Plant J. 1998; 13: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This construct was obtained from plasmid pHISi (Clontech) by insertion, between the XbaI (end-filled with Klenow DNA polymerase) and EcoRI sites, of the DNA fragment generated by annealing of the following two complementary oligonucleotides: 5′-aattcTTCTTCAAGCTTCAAGACAATCCTAGAAATTACTTCTTCAAGCTTCAAGACAATCCTAGAAATTACTTCTTCAAGCTTCAAGACAATCCTAGAAATTAC-3′ (top strand) and 5′-GTAATTTCTAGGATTGTCTTGAAGCTTGAAGAAGTAATTTCTAGGATTGTCTTGAAGCTTGAAGAAGTAATTTCTAGGATTGTCTTGAAGCTTGAAGAAg-3′ (bottom strand). For one-hybrid screening, the (G4HSE I)x3::HIS3 reporter yeast strain was transformed with DNA prepared from the embryo cDNA library, after amplification of 1,660,000 primary clones. Five million yeast transformants were plated on SD-His-Leu + 15 mm3-aminotriazole. After 4–8 days of growth at 30 °C, 24 putative positive yeast clones were selected for further analyses. Four cDNAs encoded the same HSF and are described in this work. The cDNA for one of these clones, HSFA9-36, was subcloned in pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene), thus obtaining pSKHSFA9-36. The full-length 5′-end of HaHSFA9 cDNA was obtained by rapid amplification mediated by selective ligation to decapped mRNA of an RNA oligonucleotide using T4 RNA ligase (RLM-RACE). We employed the general materials and conditions included in the GeneRacerTM Kit (Invitrogen). Specific conditions in our case included the use of 1 μg of total RNA from 14 dpa sunflower embryos as starting material. Reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C using random primers. The nested amplification of the full-length cDNA 5′-end was performed at an annealing temperature of 60 °C. We used the following oligonucleotide primer pairs: GeneRacerTM 5′-primer (for the 1st PCR) or GeneRacerTM 5′-nested primer (for the 2nd PCR) and HSFA9-RACE primer, which spans between positions 265 and 241 in the noncoding strand of HaHSFA9 cDNA. The PCR-amplified cDNA sequences were cloned in vector pCRR4-TOPOR (plasmid pCRR4-TOPOR::HSFA9–5′), after addition of 3′-A overhangs under the conditions of the TOPO TA CloningR kit (Invitrogen). The full-length HaHSFA9 cDNA clone (plasmid pSKHSFA9-F) was assembled in vector pBluescript SK+ by ligation of a 120-bp DNA fragment from pCRR4-TOPOR::HSFA9–5′ with the rest of the cDNA sequences in plasmid pSKHSFA9-36. The 120-bp fragment was obtained by PCR amplification (using the primers TOPO-1, 5′-atcATATTCTCCTTCAAAAA-3′, and HSFA9-RACE), followed by digestion withStyI (the joining site, at position 122 in the HaHSFA9 cDNA). The EcoRV half-site (lowercase nucleotides) in primer TOPO-1 provided the 5′-insertion point in the vector polylinker sequence. In vitrotranscription, probe purification, and ribonuclease protection assays were performed as described (10Carranco R. Almoguera C. Jordano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27470-27475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To obtain the HaHSFA9 riboprobe, we cloned (in pBluescript SK+) the EcoRI fragment from plasmid pSKHSFA9-36, and generated pSKHSFA9-RI. The orientation of the insert in pSKHSFA9-RI was such that after linearization with XhoI, transcription from the T3 promoter originated the 507-nucleotide antisense probe used in our experiments. The antigen was expressed in BL21Escherichia coli cells from plasmid pRSET-HSFA9ΔBglII. This plasmid included the HaHSFA9 cDNA sequences, between BglII (position 683) andPstI (position 1247), inserted in the vector pRSET-A (Invitrogen). For rabbit immunizations, we purified the antigen by TALONR metal affinity chromatography (Clontech). The whole serum was affinity-purified using the antigen bound to ImmobilonTM-P (Millipore) (14Almoguera C. Coca M.A. Jordano J. Plant J. 1993; 4: 947-958Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The purified antibodies were used at final dilution of 1:4000. For hybridization with the Rabbit anti-HSC70 antibodies (diluted to 1:2000, StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.), blots were stripped using theRe-Blot Plus recycling kit (Chemicon International). The expression vector used for the functional assays in yeast contained the full-length HaHSFA9 cDNA, which was excised from plasmid pSKHSFA9-F as a SalI-SacI DNA fragment. This fragment was used to replace the LpHSFA2SalI-SacI DNA sequences in a plasmid derived from pAD5Δ as described previously (15Boscheinen O. Lyck R. Queitsch C. Treuter E. Zimarino V. Scharf K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The RSY4 yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) strain and the protocols for β−galactosidase activity assays were also described (15Boscheinen O. Lyck R. Queitsch C. Treuter E. Zimarino V. Scharf K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To substitute ScHSF1 for HaHSFA9 in RSY4, the HSF1 mutant strain with the ScHSF1 plasmid was transformed with the pAD5Δ-HSFA9 plasmid. The ScHSF1 plasmid was then eliminated by growth in SD-Leu medium followed by plating at low density in SD + 5-fluoro-orotic acid. The final HSF plasmid contents were verified by PCR. We described previously (16Rojas A. Almoguera C. Jordano J. Plant J. 1999; 20: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) the conditions used for transient expression in sunflower embryos and the employed GUS reporter plasmids. Double digestion of the full-length cDNA plasmid (pSKHSFA9-F) withEcoRV and SacI allowed the substitution of the GUS sequences in plasmid pBI221 for those of HaHSFA9. In that way we obtained the effector plasmid (p35S::HSFA9) used in the transient activation assays. By cloning in pBIN19 the SalI-SacI insert of a pBluescript SK-derived plasmid described previously, (−1132::GUS(mut P), see Ref. 16Rojas A. Almoguera C. Jordano J. Plant J. 1999; 20: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we constructed the binary version of the P mutant chimeric gene. We then generated different primary (T0) tobacco transgenic plant using published procedures (17Coca M.A. Almoguera C. Thomas T.L. Jordano J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The progeny (T1) of plants with the P mutant chimeric gene was also obtained. In parallel, we obtained transgenic plants (T0 and T1) for the previously described binary plasmid with wild type chimeric gene (−1132::GUS (WT), see Ref. 17Coca M.A. Almoguera C. Thomas T.L. Jordano J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We compared the developmental (using the T0 plants) and the heat stress-induced expression patterns (using the T1 plants) of different independent transformants (between 4 and 10 per construct) with a similar number (1Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 2Rallu M. Loones M. Lallemand Y. Morimoto R. Morange M. Mezger V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2392-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 3Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar) of integration events. The fluorometric GUS assays during seed maturation and the statistical analyses were as reported previously (11Almoguera C. Prieto D.P. Jordano J. Plant J. 1998; 13: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Heat stress treatments were for 2.5 h at 42 °C followed by recovery for 3 h at 25 °C prior to GUS activity determinations. To isolatetrans-acting factors involved in the developmental activation of sHSP gene promoters during the embryogenesis of sunflower, we used the yeast one-hybrid cloning approach (18Li J.J. Herskowitz I. Science. 1993; 262: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Our previous characterization of two such promoters, Hahsp17.6G1and Hahsp17.7G4, pointed to a similar and peculiar sequence arrangement in their functionally defined HSEs (10Carranco R. Almoguera C. Jordano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27470-27475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 11Almoguera C. Prieto D.P. Jordano J. Plant J. 1998; 13: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the case of the Hahsp17.7G4 promoter, we found that the proximal HSE I region would contain overlapping binding sites for HSFs and distinct factors involved in activation during earlier stages of embryogenesis (11Almoguera C. Prieto D.P. Jordano J. Plant J. 1998; 13: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to use that region as bait that could allow cloning several factors at a time, including the HSF(s) involved in the late developmental activation of both promoters. We directly trimerized these sequences without adding nucleotides that would extend the arrangement of GAA-like and TTC-like HSE core elements with the natural two-nucleotide separation, nnGAAnnTTCnn, etc. We obtained 24 positive colonies. These clones were found to represent different groups. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences showed that one group, with four independent cDNA isolates, encoded a putative transcription factor belonging to the HSF family. Interestingly, in none of them was the GAL4 activation domain cloned in-frame with the deduced amino acid sequences. This indicated that the HSF-encoded sequences were able to activate transcription by themselves, at least in the promoter context of the yeast reporter strain containing the multimerized bait. We assembled a complete cDNA from the nucleotide sequences determined from the four independent HSF clones (Fig.1). The four clones included identical nucleotide sequences predicted to encode a protein with DBD and oligomerization domains (with HR-A/B) that identify HSFs (see for example the reviews in Refs. 3Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar and 19Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the nucleotide sequences of these clones maintained the same reading frame to the cloned 5′-ends. Thus, we could not exclude that the predicted HSF protein was N-terminally truncated. Full-length 5′-end cDNA sequences were cloned by RLM-RACE. This added 40 nucleotides that maintained the reading frame without including supplementary initiation codons (Fig. 1). We named the predicted protein HaHSFA9 because its amino acid sequence clearly showed the characteristics of a class A plant HSF (Fig. 1) and because it was most similar to the AtHSFA9 described previously (4Nover L. Bharti K. Döring P. Mishra S.K. Ganguli A. Scharf K.D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the DBD and HR-A/B region of HaHSFA9 was 54.5% identical to AtHSFA9 (data not shown). HaHSFA9 showed the distinctive insertion of 21 amino acid residues between the repeat regions HR-A/B in the oligomerization domain (Fig. 1) (9Nover L. Scharf K.D. Gagliardi D. Vergne P. Czarnecka V.E. Gurley W.B. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HaHSFA9 also had a nuclear localization signal located adjacent to the HR-A/B region as well as a C-terminal HR-C region and AHA motifs, which all are classification criteria for class A HSFs (9Nover L. Scharf K.D. Gagliardi D. Vergne P. Czarnecka V.E. Gurley W.B. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, HaHSFA9 showed some peculiar characteristics compared with other HSFs. This included the very unusual presence in the DBD of an arginine residue in an invariant position encoding glycine in plant and non-plant HSFs (see Arg at position 131 in Fig. 1). Another unusual amino acid change in HaHSFA9 replaced a tyrosine residue conserved in the majority of class A plant HSFs (4Nover L. Bharti K. Döring P. Mishra S.K. Ganguli A. Scharf K.D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including AtHSFA9 (see Arg at position 114 in Fig. 1). We indicate other unusual structural features (see Fig. 1) as follows: an acidic region N-terminal of the DBD domain (amino acid positions 7–66), and peculiar and putative AHA motifs. These AHA motifs would be related to those found in the activation domains of other class A HSFs (reviewed in Ref. 4Nover L. Bharti K. Döring P. Mishra S.K. Ganguli A. Scharf K.D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The total number of AHAs and their molecular position (in particular that of C-terminal motif) is different for HaHSFA9. We next investigated the expression patterns of HaHSFA9. We started by determining HaHSFA9 mRNA accumulation patterns using an RNase A protection approach. We performed hybridizations using a collection of total RNA samples from sunflower embryos and from different organs from control and stressed plants. We previously used the same RNA samples for other analyses of developmental mRNA accumulation and to analyze the heat- and water-stress response of other sunflower genes by RNase A protection. This provided positive controls for the different stress treatments and for normal developmental expression (14Almoguera C. Coca M.A. Jordano J. Plant J. 1993; 4: 947-958Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Coca M.A. Almoguera C. Thomas T.L. Jordano J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Carranco R. Almoguera C. Jordano J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For the hybridizations analyzed here, we employed a riboprobe with sequences from the non-coding strand of HaHSFA9. We expected that, after digestion with RNase A, full protection of this probe would produce a protected RNA fragment of 395 nucleotides. Results presented at the top of Fig. 2 show that HaHSFA9 mRNAs accumulated from early zygotic embryogenesis in developing seeds and disappeared very early during germination after seed imbibition. The mRNAs were detected at 8 dpa, and their accumulation slightly increased up to 18 dpa and then started to decrease. These transcripts were barely detectable at 5 dpi and were undetectable at control temperatures in older seedlings (14 dpi) and in different organs of adult plants, as in leaves or stems (Fig. 2, bottom). Because heat stress treatments have been shown to induce the mRNA accumulation of some plant HSFs (reviewed in Ref. 4Nover L. Bharti K. Döring P. Mishra S.K. Ganguli A. Scharf K.D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated such behavior for HaHSFA9. In addition, we investigated the effect of water stress treatment, as the expression of possible target genes for HaHSFA9 is induced during the desiccation stages of embryogenesis (10Carranco R. Almoguera C. Jordano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27470-27475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,17Coca M.A. Almoguera C. Thomas T.L. Jordano J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 863-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Neither stress treatment, in particular heat, induced HaHSFA9 mRNA accumulation after embryogenesis. We only detected very low levels of water stress-induced transcripts in stems and leaves, for which we needed to substantially increase autoradiography times (Fig.2, bottom). In these experiments we also detected at least two additional RNA-protected fragments (Fig. 2, arrowhead 2). The most likely explanation for such fragments would be either the detection of unspliced mRNA or that of mRNAs that are shorter from the 5′-end (see the diagram at the bottom of Fig. 2). The presence of an intron in the DBD region of theHaHSFA9 gene is supported by PCR amplification using primers from the cDNA flanking the conserved intron position (Ref.4Nover L. Bharti K. Döring P. Mishra S.K. Ganguli A. Scharf K.D. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2001; 6: 177-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and data not shown). We obtained specific antibodies against the HaHSFA9 protein (see “Experimental Procedures”) and analyzed expression at the protein level during zygotic embryogenesis and in control and stressed plants. The results of Western immunodetection experiments shown in Fig.3 confirmed most of the results observed at the mRNA level (Fig. 2); the detection of the HaHSFA9 protein in embryos from 8 dpa, and its absence from leaves and stems of control and heat-stressed plants. The protein persisted at low levels in germinated seeds but as observed for the mRNAs only to 5 dpi. We also noticed some differences, as we could not detect HaHSFA9 protein accumulation in response to water stress in vegetative tissues. The detected protein has an apparent molecular mass of 53.7 kDa. We confirmed the integrity and transcriptional activity of the HaHSFA9 protein(s) encoded by the nucleotide sequences assembled in the full-length cDNA. First, we constructed an appropriate yeast expression plasmid containing the complete coding sequence from the putative first methionine to position 1252 in the 3′-untranslated region. This plasmid was used for functional replacement analysis of ScHSF1, the sole HSF in the yeast S. cerevisiae. The results in Fig. 4 A (top) show that this strain was as viable as the original ScHSF1 strain at 28 °C and even at 35 °C. In contrast only ScHSF1 allowed growth at 37 °C. The two strains grew at 28 °C in liquid YPD medium with a similar doubling time (2–2.5 h, data not shown). These results demonstrated functional integrity of the encoded HaHSFA9 protein(s). This is comparable with results described for other class A HSFs fromLycopersicon peruvianum (15Boscheinen O. Lyck R. Queitsch C. Treuter E. Zimarino V. Scharf K.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We also used the HaHSFA9 yeast strain to verify the transcriptional activation potential of HaHSFA9 and its dependence on HSE sequence complexity. We constructed lacZ reporter gene plasmids containing the natural HSE region of Hahsp17.7G4(WT), or a mutant version (m) of it with severe effects on chimeric HSF-dependent gene expression in transgenic plants (m = mutE in Ref. 11Almoguera C. Prieto D.P. Jordano J. Plant J. 1998; 13: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These reporter plasmids contained two HSE repeats (promoter proximal and distal, with its natural spacing in between) in front of minimal yeast promoter, instead the oligomerized proximal HSE repeat used for one-hybrid cloning. HaHSFA9 strains transformed with the WT reporter showed high levels of β-galactosidase activity, and this transcriptional activation by HaHSFA9 was severely reduced in the mutant reporter strain (Fig. 4 A, bottom, G4HSE). Interestingly the activity measured in this strain was still higher than background values reported for other plant HSFs and mutant HSE reporter plasmids in similar experiments performed without temperature stress (approximately. ≤1, see Ref. 21Bharti K. Schmidt E. Lyck R. Heerklotz D. Bublak D. Scharf K.D. Plant J. 2000; 22: 355-365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The m HSE array still has a small number of gapped, GAA-, and TTC-like core elements (11Almoguera C. Prieto D.P. Jordano J. Plant J. 1998; 13: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 A). As a consequence, our results could reflect a singular capacity, of HaHSFA9, for binding or/(and) activation from these HSEs. We tested and confirmed this hypothesis by observing transcriptional activation of anotherlacZ reporter plasmid containing the HSE region fromHahsp17.6G1 (Fig. 4 A, bottom, G1HSE). This HSE contains only a promoter-distal, shorter, and gapped array of core elements (10Carranco R. Almoguera C. Jordano J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27470-27475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this case, the HSE mutations reduced transcriptional activation by HsHSFA9 further than in the case of the G4HSE mutant plasmid and to values more similar than those reported previously for background levels. These results suggested that HaHSFA9 might activate transcription from the Hahsp17.6G1 promoter in plant seeds. We performed transient expression assays in sunflower embryos. We used two chimeric genes that were previously analyzed in transgenic plants: −1486::GUS and −1486(m)::GUS. Such genes only differ in three crucial nucleotide substitutions, located in the HSE region of Hahsp17.6G1. These substitutions impaired transcriptional activation during desiccation stages of zygotic embryogenesis (20Carranco R. Almoguera C. Jordano J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 4 Bdemonstrated that HaHSFA9, expressed from an appropriate"

We examined these issues in transgenic mice that utilize regulatory elements from the cryptdin-2 gene (Defcr2) to express simian virus 40 large T antigen (TAg) in prostatic NE cells.

Follow-up studies of candidate mediators and biomarkers of differentiation/growth in the microarray data set involved real time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR assays of laser capture microdissected NE cells from CR2-TAg prostates plus liver metastases, and immunohistochemical comparisons of transgenic mouse prostates and 35 human CaP samples. Our findings include (a) expression of the bHLH mouse achaete-scute homolog (mASH1) in normal and CR2-TAg NE cells and foci of NED in human CaP, (b) glutamic acid decarboxylase and its product (γ-aminobutyric acid) in neoplastic NE cells juxtaposed next to cohorts of normal γ-aminobutyric acid receptor expressing secretory cells (a potential route for paracrine interactions between these two epithelial lineages), and (c) aromatic l-amino-acid decarboxylase, but not its dopamine/serotonin products, in CR2-TAg NE cells and NED.

These results underscore the value of CR2-TAg mice for characterizing normal NE cell biology and tumorigenesis. The prostate is a tubuloalveolar gland composed of three epithelial lineages. Members of the secretory cell lineage (also known as luminal cells) predominate. Basal cells are the principal proliferating cell type and are located between the basement membrane and the secretory cell layer (1Bonkhoff H. Stein U. Remberger K. Hum.

Hum. Pathol. 1992; 23: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). NE cells have irregular dendritic-like extensions that allow them to contact neighboring epithelial cells over a distance of several cell diameters (2di Sant'Agnese P.A. Hum. Pathol. 1992; 23: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 3di Sant'Agnese P.A. De Mesy Jensen K.L. Hum. Pathol. 1984; 15: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The contributions of NE cells to normal prostatic development and physiology remain poorly defined. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American men (4Jemal A. Thomas A. Murray T. Thun M. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2002; 52: 23-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (2934) Google Scholar). NE cell carcinoma of the prostate is rare. Like NE cell cancers in other tissues (e.g. lung), it is highly invasive (5Cohen R.J. Glezerson G. Haffejee Z. Br. J. Urol. 1991; 66: 405-410Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Conventional adenocarcinoma of the prostate (CaP) can exhibit features of neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). Studies indicate that development of NED heralds a phase of more aggressive, androgen-independent growth (6Bohrer M. Schmoll J. Verh. Dtsch. Ges. Pathol. 1993; 77: 107-110PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dema A. Raica M. Tudose N. Rom. J. Morphol. Embryol. 1996; 42: 83-88PubMed Google Scholar, 8Speights V. Cohen M. Riggs M. Coffield K. Keegan G. Arber D. Br. J. Urol. 1997; 80: 281-286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mediators underlying this behavior are largely undefined. Moreover, variations in the reported incidence of NED in patients with CaP likely arise from sampling methods and from the limited number of NE cell biomarkers available to score neuroendocrine features. Animal models are needed to define the molecular features of prostatic NE cells so that their biological properties can be better characterized, new biomarkers of NED identified for more accurate phenotyping of patient populations, and new therapeutic targets uncovered. We have created one such genetically defined model. It is based on the finding that nucleotides −6500 to +34 of the mouse cryptdin-2 gene (Defcr2, abbreviated CR2) can be used to express foreign gene products, such as simian virus large T antigen (SV40 TAg), in a subset of mouse prostatic NE cells (9Garabedian E.M. Humphrey P.A. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15382-15387Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Multiple pedigrees of FVB/N mice containing a CR2-SV40 TAg transgene develop the presumptive precursor to CaP, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), by 8–9 weeks of age (9Garabedian E.M. Humphrey P.A. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15382-15387Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The onset of PIN follows the onset of transgene expression by ≤1 week, indicating that the NE cell population is exquisitely sensitive to transformation by this viral oncoprotein. These initiated NE cells expand rapidly within ducts and acini. Invasion into the underlying stroma is first apparent by 10 weeks of age and progresses quickly from 12 to 16 weeks. Unlike most transgenic mouse models of cancer, metastatic spread is a hallmark. The majority of males die by 6 months of age with metastases in their regional lymph nodes, liver, lung, brain, and bone (9Garabedian E.M. Humphrey P.A. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15382-15387Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies have shown that the transformed NE cells do not contain detectable levels of the androgen receptor. Castration at 4 weeks has no effect on the course of the disease (9Garabedian E.M. Humphrey P.A. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15382-15387Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Female CR2-TAg mice have a normal lifespan and no evidence of cancer (9Garabedian E.M. Humphrey P.A. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15382-15387Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The CR2-TAg mouse offers an opportunity to obtain a molecular description of prostatic NE cells. A functional genomics approach is feasible because of the stereotyped pattern of evolution of this cancer, and because of the ability to recover amplified, neoplastic NE cell populations from discrete tumor foci using laser capture microdissection. In the present report, we describe the results of such an analysis. We have focused on identifying candidate mediators of NE cell differentiation and new biomarkers of this epithelial lineage. We show that data obtained from this mouse model are applicable to human CaP. Mice hemizygous for the CR2-TAg transgene and their normal littermates were housed in microisolater cages in a barrier facility, under a strict 12-h light cycle, and given free access to a standard chow diet (Lab Diet 5053, Purina Mills, St. Louis, MO). All mice were specified pathogen-free (defined as negative for hepatitis, Minute, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, ectromelia, polyoma, Sendai, pneumonia, and mouse adenoviruses, enteric bacterial pathogens, and parasites). CR2-TAg animals (n = 9) were sacrificed at 8 weeks of age, and their prostates were removed, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, washed in 70% ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and each gland serially sectioned in its entirety (section thickness = 5 μm). Every 10th section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscopy. A total of 749 foci of PIN were evaluated for architectural pattern using standard criteria applied to the human prostate (10Bostwick D.G. Amin M.B. Dundore P. Marsh W. Schultz D.S. Hum. Pathol. 1993; 24: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Prostates were removed from transgenic mice and their normal littermates after they were sacrificed at 10, 16, and 24 weeks of age (n = 8 mice/group/time point). Macroscopic liver metastases were dissected from five 24-week CR2-TAg males (n = 2–8 metastases/mouse). Samples, similar in size to the dissected metastases, were taken from comparable lobes of the livers of five age-matched normal male littermates. Total RNA was extracted from prostates, liver metastases, and normal liver samples using the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Equal sized aliquots of RNAs from a given type of tissue were pooled, and an aliquot of each pooled sample (2 μg) was used for random hexanucleotide-primed cDNA synthesis (11Stappenbeck T.S. Hooper L.V. Manchester J.K. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 356: 168-196Google Scholar). cDNAs were added to 25-μl reaction mixtures containing 12.5 μl of 2× SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 0.25 units of UDP-N-glycosidase (Invitrogen), and 900 nmgene-specific primers (for a list of these primers, see Table A in the Supplemental Material). A melting curve was used to identify a temperature where only the amplicon, and not primer dimers, accounted for the SYBR green-bound fluorescence (12Hooper L.V. Mills J.C. Roth K.A. Stappenbeck T.S. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Methods Microbiol. 2002; 31: 559-589Crossref Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate with an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). All data were normalized to an internal standard (18 S ribosomal RNA; ΔΔC T method, User Bulletin 2, Applied Biosystems). Prostates were recovered from 16- and 24-week-old transgenic animals and macroscopic liver metastases from 24-week-old animals (n = 3 mice/time point). Tissues were immediately frozen in OCT (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA) and 8-μm-thick cryosections were prepared. Sections were stained briefly with hematoxylin and eosin and NE cells harvested by LCM using the PixCell II system (15-μm diameter laser spot; Arcturus; Mountain View, CA) and CapSure HS LCM Caps (Arcturus) (11Stappenbeck T.S. Hooper L.V. Manchester J.K. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 356: 168-196Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from 50,000 dissected cells/sample using the PicoPure isolation kit (Arcturus) and analyzed by qRT-PCR (11Stappenbeck T.S. Hooper L.V. Manchester J.K. Wong M.H. Gordon J.I. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 356: 168-196Google Scholar). CR2-TAg mice and their normal littermates were sacrificed at 16 weeks of age (n = 8 mice/group). Intact prostates were excised, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and total cellular RNA was extracted (RNeasy Midi Kit). Equal amounts of RNA from each tissue in each group were pooled. Two cRNAs were then independently generated from each pooled RNA preparation. Each cRNA was hybridized to a set of Mu11K GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Following hybridization and washing, the overall fluorescence intensity across each chip was scaled to a target intensity of 1500 using proprietary GeneChip software, and pairwise comparisons of mRNA levels were performed with the normal prostate GeneChips designated as “base line.” Data sets were generated by extracting all mRNAs that were called “Present” in either the normal or transgenic prostate GeneChip, and whose levels were ≥2-fold increased or decreased in transgenicversus normal prostates in duplicate GeneChip comparisons. Transgenic mice and their normal littermates were sacrificed at 10, 12, 16, and 24 weeks of age (n = 2–5 mice/time point/group/pedigree; n = 2 pedigrees). Dorsal, ventral, anterior, and lateral lobes of the prostate were removeden bloc. Liver and abdominal lymph nodes were also retrieved. All tissues were fixed for 6 h at room temperature in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, washed in 70% ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were deparaffinized in xylenes, rehydrated in isopropyl alcohol, microwaved for 25 min in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6 (1500-watt GE Sensor Microwave), washed in PBS, placed in PBS-blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 30 min at 23 °C, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with one or more of the following antibodies: (i) goat anti-SV40 TAg (generated against the purified intact viral oncoprotein; final dilution in blocking buffer = 1:1000); (ii) mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) to mouse achaete-scute homolog (mASH1; Clone 24B7.2D11.1; Pharmingen; diluted 1:10 when fluorescence detection methods were used, 1:250 for chromogenic development); (iii) rabbit anti-human synaptophysin (1:100, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA); (iv) mouse mAb to rat synaptophysin (clone SVP-38; 1:100, Sigma); (v) mouse mAb raised against human chromogranin A (CgA; clone LK2H10 (2di Sant'Agnese P.A. Hum. Pathol. 1992; 23: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar); Chemicon, Temecula, CA; 1:1000); (vi) rabbit anti-γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA, Sigma; 1:100); (vii) mouse mAb against bovine GABAAreceptor β-chain, (clone bd17; Chemicon; 1:50); (viii) guinea pig anti-GABAB receptor (raised against a peptide whose sequence is shared by both GABAB R1a and GABABR1b and should therefore recognize both isoforms; Chemicon; 1:500); (ix) rabbit anti-bovine aromatic l-amino-acid decarboxylase (AADC; Protos Biotech, New York, (13Cho S. Hwang O. Baker H. Baik H.H. Volpe B.T. Son J.H. Joh T.H. Synapse. 1999; 34: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar); 1:100 (immunofluorescence) or 1:250 (chromogenic detection)); (x) rat anti-serotonin (Chemicon; 1:100), (xi) mouse mAb raised against the C-terminal domain of mouse tyrosine hydroxylase (clone 1B5; Novocastra; 1:100); (xii) rabbit anti-mouse Nov (a generous gift from P. Ellis, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; 1:500); (xiii) rabbit anti-human Nov (obtained from R. Rosenfeld, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR; 1:2500); and (xiv) rabbit anti-mouse laminin (Chemicon; 1:1000). To evaluate integrin expression, prostates were fixed in periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde for 45 min, washed in PBS, and frozen in OCT. Frozen sections were thawed at room temperature (20 min), washed in PBS followed by PBS-blocking buffer (20 min, room temperature), and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with one of the following antibodies: (i) hamster anti-mouse integrin α2 (Pharmingen, 1:500); (ii) rabbit anti-mouse integrin α3 (Chemicon, 1:500); (iii) rabbit anti-mouse integrin α5 (Chemicon, 1:500); (iv) rat anti-mouse integrin α6 (Pharmingen, 1:500); (v) mouse anti-human integrin αv (Chemicon, 1:500); (vi) rabbit anti-mouse integrin β1 (Chemicon, 1:500); and (vii) rat anti-mouse integrin β4 (1:500, Pharmingen). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-, indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-, Alexa fluor 488-, or Alexa fluor 633-conjugated antibodies to goat, mouse, rabbit, hamster, or guinea pig Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, or Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; 1:500). In some cases, bound mouse antibodies were detected using the M.O.M. kit (Vector Laboratories), together with the Vectastain ABC elite kit and NovaRED (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). mASH1-antibody complexes were identified using the tyramide signal amplification indirect cyanine-3 kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Stained slides were viewed and photographed using a Zeiss Axioscope or a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. A tissue panel, consisting of 35 prostates with conventional adenocarcinoma, 8 lymph node metastases from a subset of these patients, 2 NE cell cancers of the prostate, and 2 small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC), was obtained, using an institutional human studies review board-approved protocol, from the archives of the Department of Pathology and Immunology at Washington University School of Medicine. Serial sections were cut from each block of paraffin-embedded tissue. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were used to assign a histopathologic grade (Gleason score) to each sample. Gleason scores ranged from 5 to 10 (see Ref. 14Gleason D. Urologic Pathology: The Prostate. Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia1977: 171-198Google Scholar for details of the scoring system). Adjacent sections were incubated with a subset of the primary antibodies described above. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using Vectastain ABC elite kit and NovaRED or 3,3′-diaminobenzidine/metal substrate (Pierce). Sections were surveyed, in a single-blinded fashion, for cells containing immunoreactive protein. Tissues were Dounce-homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.0, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) (15Lamprecht F. Coyle J.T. Brain Res. 1972; 41: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected; protein concentrations were determined (Bio-Rad protein assay kit), and the material employed for immunoblot or enzyme activity assays. 25 μg of protein from three pooled 24-week normal prostates, three pooled 24-week CR2-TAg prostates, or normal mouse kidney (positive control) were separated by electrophoresis under reducing conditions using a 10% NuPAGE BisTris gel and MOPS-SDS buffer (Invitrogen). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred from the gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen) by electroblotting. The resulting blot was incubated with rabbit anti-AADC (see above; diluted 1:2500 in blocking buffer (0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS)) or a mouse mAb raised against tyrosine hydroxylase (also see above; 1:100). AADC-antibody complexes were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:10,000) and the Tropix Western-Light kit. Tyrosine hydroxylase-antibody complexes were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Control experiments were performed (with duplicate blots) where primary antibodies were omitted. Total cellular RNA isolated from 24-week-old CR2-TAg prostates and from brain (positive control) were used for RT-PCR assays. Four sets of primer pairs were used to generate amplicons representing various sets of exonic sequences from the Ddcgene: 5′-TTTTCAACATGGATTCCCGTG (forward) and 5′-ATCAGATGTGTAAGCAACCAGCTT (reverse); 5′-TACTGGCTGCTCGGACTAAAGTTA (forward) and 5′-CACCATTCAGAAGATACCGGAATT (reverse); 5′-GGGTCCCATCTGCAACCA (forward) and 5′-AAACCACATTTTCAAAGAGCGAAAT (reverse); 5′-GCCTTTAATATGGAGCCTGTTTATC (forward) and 5′-GTGGTAGTTATTTTTCTC (reverse). The amplicons were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis. In addition, a single amplicon, containing the open reading frame that encodes the active form of AADC, was purified from the gel and its nucleotide sequence determined. AADC activity was assayed using the procedure of Lamprecht and Coyle (15Lamprecht F. Coyle J.T. Brain Res. 1972; 41: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) with modifications. Reaction mixtures (250 μl) contained 10 μg/ml pyridoxal phosphate (Sigma), 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), 600 μml-DOPA (Sigma), 30 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and dl-[14C]DOPA (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO; diluted to a final specific activity of 1 μCi/μmol; 0.15 μCi/assay). The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and then terminated by adding 1 ml of a solution of 4% perchloric acid and 2 mm4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid (Tiron; Sigma). [14C]CO2 generated during the course of the assay was collected on Whatman filter paper (affixed to the top of the reaction vessel after being soaked in a solution of 20% α−phenylethylamine (Sigma) and 80% methanol). Radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Controls studies established that the assay was linear with respect to time (0–20 min) and input lysate protein concentration (0–5 μg). Prostates from three 24-week normal and three CR2-TAg mice were assayed separately in duplicate. Prostates were harvested from two 24-week-old normal mice and two age-matched CR2-TAg littermates. Liver metastases (carefully dissected from normal surrounding tissue) and lymph nodes containing metastases were obtained from one of the transgenic animals. Each sample was weighed, homogenized (separately) in 50 volumes of 0.1 m perchloric acid, 0.4 mmsodium metabisulfite, and centrifuged at ∼20,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was diluted 20-fold in HPLC buffer (1.2 mm heptanesulfonic acid, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 2.5, plus 6% methanol) and sterile-filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Nylon Acrodisc 13, Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). 100-μl aliquots of each sample were analyzed for dopamine by chromatography on a HR-80 column (ESA, Chelmsford, MA) with the mobile phase consisting of the HPLC buffer described above (n = 3 assays/sample). Compounds were detected with a Coulochem Electrochemical Detector (model 5100A) fitted with a model 5011 analytical cell (ESA). Concentrations were calculated using dopamine standards run in parallel assays. Four architectural patterns of PIN are common in human CaP: tufted, micropapillary, cribriform, and flat. Bostwick et al. (10Bostwick D.G. Amin M.B. Dundore P. Marsh W. Schultz D.S. Hum. Pathol. 1993; 24: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) defined the frequency of these patterns in 60 patients. Micropapillary was most common (54.3% of fields examined per tissue sample), followed by tufted (32.5%), cribriform (9.8%), and flat (3.4%). We performed an analogous quantitative histopathologic analysis of nine 8-week-old CR2-TAg mouse prostates. This time point represents the initial week of onset of transgene expression, with the concomitant appearance of PIN. Each of the four patterns was observed (see Fig. 1S in the Supplemental Material). Tufted and cribriform patterns were encountered at a similar frequency in CR2-TAg mice as in men with PIN (50 and 7%, respectively). However, the flat pattern was very frequent in mice (43% of fields) rather than being least frequent, while micropapillary architecture was least frequent in mice (0.3%) rather than being most frequent as in humans. As the area occupied by PIN within an acinus or duct increases, different architectural patterns appear next to one another (Fig.1 A). Together, these findings indicate that a specific architectural pattern of PIN cannot be used as a diagnostic criterion to include or exclude a NE cell origin, at least in mice. Further histologic studies of 10–12-week-old CR2-TAg mice (n = 24) revealed that growth of PIN prior to invasion resembles the ductal/acinar spreading pattern observed in humans. In the dorsal, ventral, and paired lateral lobes of the mouse prostate, secretory cells were progressively replaced as transformed NE cells expanded. The underlying basal cell layer and basement membrane were preserved. A second pattern of cellular spreading was encountered in the anterior lobes of the mouse prostate (also called the coagulating glands). Here, transformed NE cells spread along the ducts between the basal cell layer and the overlying layer of normal secretory cells (Fig. 1 B). This undermining pattern of spread is not present in human prostates. By using a panel of integrin antibodies (see “Experimental Procedures”), we found that loss of β4is a sensitive marker of early invasion (Fig. 1 C). The progressive amplification of NE cells in CR2-TAg prostates offers an opportunity to use DNA microarrays to profile their molecular properties. Therefore, total cellular RNA was isolated from eight 16-week normal prostates and eight age-matched CR2-TAg prostates. Equal sized aliquots of RNA obtained from each prostate in a given group were pooled. Two cRNA targets were independently synthesized from each pooled RNA sample, and each cRNA was used to interrogate commercial, high density, oligonucleotide-based microarrays (GeneChips) containing probe sets representing 11,000 mouse genes and EST clusters. A total of 123 mRNAs (including 22 ESTs) were identified that satisfied the following selection criteria: the transcript was called Present by proprietary GeneChip software in either normal or transgenic prostatic RNAs; its levels were at least 2-fold different between transgenic versus normal prostates (base line); the difference was in the same direction (increased or decreased) in duplicate GeneChip comparisons. 122 transcripts were increased ≥2-fold in transgenic prostates, whereas one (encoding annexin A1) was decreased. The genes were sorted into several categories. The largest category (32 genes) was defined as “Neural/Endocrine.” An annotated list of all genes is provided in Table B of the Supplemental Material. Nine of the 32 genes in the Neural/Endocrine category specify transcription factors. They belong to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH), SRY-related high mobility group box (Sox), sine-oculis homeobox (Six), and hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) families. There were two bHLH proteins: mouse homolog of achaete-scute (mASH1; average fold change (AFC) as calculated by GeneChip software from duplicate DNA microarray assays = 38)) and Hes6 (AFC = 11). mASH1 forms a heterodimer with the ubiquitously expressed bHLH factor Tcfe2a (E2A immunoglobulin enhancer-binding factors E12/E47) to effect neural differentiation (16Johnson J.E. Birren S.J. Saito T. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3596-3600Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Tomita K. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 765-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). mASH1 is also important in differentiation of several NE cell populations (see below). Hes1 antagonizes the E box-binding ability of the mASH1-Tcfe2a heterodimer complex (18Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) and can repress mASH1 transcription (19Chen H. Thiagalingam A. Chopra H. Borges M.W. Feder J.N. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5355-5360Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Hes6, in turn, functionally antagonizes the action of Hes1, thereby relieving Hes1 inhibition of bHLH proteins and promoting neural differentiation (20Bae S. Bessho Y. Hojo M. Kageyama R. Development. 2000; 127: 2933-2943Pu"
https://openalex.org/W1988864144,"Rad17, Rad1, Hus1, and Rad9 are key participants in checkpoint signaling pathways that block cell cycle progression in response to genotoxins. Biochemical and molecular modeling data predict that Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 form a heterotrimeric complex, dubbed 9-1-1, which is loaded onto chromatin by a complex of Rad17 and the four small replication factor C (RFC) subunits (Rad17-RFC) in response to DNA damage. It is unclear what checkpoint proteins or checkpoint signaling events regulate the association of the 9-1-1 complex with DNA. Here we show that genotoxin-induced chromatin binding of 9-1-1 does not require the Rad9-inducible phosphorylation site (Ser-272). Although we found that Rad9 undergoes an additional phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK)-dependent posttranslational modification, we also show that genotoxin-triggered 9-1-1 chromatin binding does not depend on the catalytic activity of the PIKKs ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), or DNA-PK. Additionally, 9-1-1 chromatin binding does not require DNA replication, suggesting that the complex can be loaded onto DNA in response to DNA structures other than stalled DNA replication forks. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that 9-1-1 chromatin binding is a proximal event in the checkpoint signaling cascade.

Collectively, these studies demonstrate that 9-1-1 chromatin binding is a proximal event in the checkpoint signaling cascade. DNA damage and replication stress activate checkpoint signaling pathways that block cell cycle progression, activate programmed cell death, and influence DNA repair. Biochemical and genetic studies in yeasts and mammals have identified many of the key components and arranged them into checkpoint signaling cascades (reviewed Refs. 1Lowndes N.F. Murguia J.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar and2Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar).

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). In response to genotoxins, ATM and ATR phosphorylate and activate the protein kinases Chk1 and Chk2 (4Rhind N. Russell P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3889-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated ATM, ATR, Chk1, and Chk2 then phosphorylate additional checkpoint proteins, including Rad9, BRCA1, p53, Cdc25A, Cdc25C, Nbs1, and other proteins that mediate checkpoint activation and DNA repair. In addition to the PIKKs, the checkpoint proteins, Rad9, Hus1, Rad1, and Rad17 (using Schizosaccharomyces pombe nomenclature) are key elements of checkpoint signaling pathways that are conserved from the yeasts to humans. Disruption of these genes in S. pombeblocks genotoxin-induced Chk1 activation (5Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, Hus1 and Rad17 are also required for genotoxin-induced Chk1 activation in mammals (6Weiss R.S. Matsuoka S. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Such studies suggest that these proteins function early in the checkpoint signaling pathway. Recent biochemical studies further support this notion. Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 form a stable heterotrimeric complex (the 9-1-1 complex) (8Burtelow M.A. Roos-Mattjus P.M. Rauen M. Babendure J.R. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol.

PCNA subunits assemble into a toroidal clamp complex that is loaded around DNA by the clamp loader, replication factor C (p140-RFC), a protein complex composed of one large subunit (p140) and four small subunits (reviewed in Ref. 15Waga S.

Consistent with the proposed biochemical functions of the 9-1-1 and Rad17-RFC complexes as a clamp-clamp loader pair, Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1 bind chromatin in response to DNA damage in a Rad17-dependent manner (7Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, the DNA structures that trigger 9-1-1 chromatin binding are poorly defined. A wide variety of genotoxins induce 9-1-1 chromatin binding (16Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that many different lesions might be recognized by Rad17-RFC. Recent work demonstrated that stalled replication forks induce Hus1 chromatin binding in Xenopus egg extracts in a DNA-polymerase α-dependent manner (17You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is unclear, therefore, whether DNA lesions generate chromatin-bound 9-1-1 complex because they block or slow DNA replication fork progression or whether other DNA structures can trigger 9-1-1 chromatin binding. Although the 9-1-1 complex and the PIKKs are required for Chk1 activation, it is unclear how these proteins affect one another's function. In humans, ATR and the 9-1-1 complex are recruited to DNA lesions independently of one another (7Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rad9 phosphorylation does not regulate its association with chromatin following genotoxic stress. However, ATM phosphorylates Rad9 on Ser-272 (18Chen M.J. Lin Y.T. Lieberman H.B. Chen G. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16580-16586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that other PIKKs may regulate genotoxin-induced Rad9 chromatin binding. Collectively, these studies raise the following questions. First, does Ser-272 phosphorylation affect 9-1-1 chromatin binding? Second, do other PIKK-dependent posttranslational modifications occur on Rad9, and do they regulate Rad9 chromatin binding? Third, is DNA replication fork stalling the sole signal that induces 9-1-1 chromatin binding? In this study, we use Rad9 mutants, pharmacologic PIKK inhibitors, and G1-synchronized cells to address the roles of DNA replication and other checkpoint proteins in the regulation of the 9-1-1 complex. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the 9-1-1 complex can be loaded onto DNA independently of all known potential regulators, suggesting that loading of the 9-1-1 complex onto chromatin is a proximal event in the checkpoint signaling pathway. Antibodies recognizing human Rad9, Hus1, Rad1, and Rad17 have been described previously (16Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol.

A rabbit polyclonal antiserum recognizing the S tag was generated to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide CKETAAAKFERNHMDS and used for immunoblotting of S-tagged proteins. Human K562 erythroleukemia cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biofluids, Rockville, MD). The factor-dependent 32D murine myeloid cell line overexpressing Bcl-xL (20Eapen A.K. Henry M.K. Quelle D.E. Quelle F.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6113-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was a gift from F. Quelle (University of Iowa) and was cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 70 pg/ml interleukin-3. K562 (1 × 107) cells were transiently transfected by electroporation (345-volt, 10-ms pulse) using a T820 electroporator (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA). A total of 40 μg of plasmid DNA was used per transfection. G1-enriched populations of 32D/Bcl-xL cells were prepared by culturing the cells in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum but lacking interleukin-3 for 30 h. Cell cycle distribution profiles were determined by flow cytometric analysis as described previously (20Eapen A.K. Henry M.K. Quelle D.E. Quelle F.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6113-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 4-Nitroquinoline oxide (4-NQO) was purchased from Sigma, dissolved in Me2SO, and stored at −20 °C. Hydroxyurea (HU) and caffeine were obtained from Sigma. Wortmannin was obtained from R. Schultz, Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer Institute. HU was prepared fresh in phosphate-buffered saline. Wortmannin was dissolved in Me2SO, stored at −70 °C, and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline prior to addition to the cells. Caffeine was dissolved fresh in 10 mm PIPES. Cells were irradiated with a 137Cs source at a dose rate of 10 Gy/min. To analyze protein expression, cells were lysed in 50 mm HEPES, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 30 mm Na4P207, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA containing freshly added 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 20 μm microcystin-LR. All lysates were either immunoprecipitated as indicated or boiled with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. S-protein-agarose (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) was used to precipitate S-tagged proteins. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to Immobilon P membranes, and immunoblotted as described. Fractionation of unbound and chromatin-bound Rad9 was performed as described previously (16Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). S tag-Rad9-pIRES2-EGFP was generated by adding an in-frame S tagTM (Novagen Inc.) to the amino terminus of Rad9 using a PCR strategy. S tag-Rad9 was cloned into pIRES2-EGFP (BD Sciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using XhoI and BamHI. Mutation of Ser-272 to Ala was performed using the sequence-overlap extension technique (21Horton R.M. Cai Z.L., Ho, S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). ATM and other PIKKs phosphorylate SQ consensus sites in a variety of checkpoint and DNA repair proteins. Rad9 contains one SQ site (Ser-272), which is phosphorylated by ATM in response to double-strand DNA breaks (18Chen M.J. Lin Y.T. Lieberman H.B. Chen G. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16580-16586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, Rad9 Ser-272 phosphorylation has been implicated in the regulation of G1to S phase progression, suggesting that Ser-272 phosphorylation participates in checkpoint activation (18Chen M.J. Lin Y.T. Lieberman H.B. Chen G. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16580-16586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because we wanted to examine the role of inducible Rad9 phosphorylation in response to a variety of DNA lesions, we first examined whether the replication inhibitor HU and the UV mimetic 4-NQO also induced Ser-272 phosphorylation (Fig. 1). We treated the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 with IR, HU, and 4-NQO. Immunoblotting of Rad9 immunoprecipitates with anti-phospho-Rad9 (Ser-272) revealed that, like IR, both HU and 4-NQO also induced Rad9 phosphorylation. Earlier studies showed that genotoxin-induced Rad9 chromatin binding is independent of ATR (7Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, Rad9 is also phosphorylated by ATM on Ser-272, suggesting that ATM or other unidentified PIKKs might affect the interaction of the 9-1-1 complex with DNA in response to various genotoxic stresses. To explore this possibility, we mutated Ser-272 to Ala (S tag-Rad9-S272A) in epitope-tagged Rad9 (S tag-Rad9) and expressed wild-type and mutant S tag-Rad9 in K562 cells. Precipitation of S tag-Rad9 and immunoblotting for Hus1, Rad1, and Rad17 revealed that Ser-272 phosphorylation did not affect the interaction of Rad9 with Hus1 or Rad1, the other members of the heteromeric 9-1-1 clamp, or with Rad17, the putative clamp loader for the 9-1-1 complex (Fig.2 A). To assess whether Ser-272 phosphorylation regulated genotoxin-induced chromatin binding, we expressed wild-type S tag-Rad9 and S tag-Rad9-S272A and assessed genotoxin-induced Rad9 chromatin binding by examining the chromatin-bound Rad9 fraction after genotoxin treatment (Fig.2 B). Wild-type S tag-Rad9 and S tag-Rad9-S272A were inducibly bound to DNA following treatment with IR, HU, and 4-NQO. However, in some experiments, S tag-Rad9-S272A exhibited slightly higher levels of chromatin binding in the absence of exogenous genotoxins, suggesting that expression of this mutant might generate low levels of genotoxic stress. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Ser-272 phosphorylation does not influence the interaction of Rad9 with its binding partners or conversion of Rad9 to a chromatin-bound form, suggesting that Ser-272 phosphorylation may regulate signaling events that lie downstream of Rad9 chromatin binding. We have previously observed that chromatin-bound Rad9 is enriched in the inducibly hyperphosphorylated form (16Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, comparison of the chromatin-bound forms of Rad9-S272A revealed that the Rad9-S272A mutant undergoes genotoxin-induced mobility shifts (see Fig.2 B), suggesting that additional inducible posttranslational modifications occur on Rad9. We reasoned that this inducible posttranslational modification would be dependent upon PIKK activity. Thus, we examined whether the PIKK inhibitors wortmannin and caffeine would block the additional genotoxin-inducible modifications. Wortmannin preferentially inhibits DNA-PK and ATM, although it also inhibits ATR less potently (22Hartley K.O. Gell D. Smith G.C. Zhang H. Divecha N. Connelly M.A. Admon A. Lees-Miller S.P.

Each drug alone was unable to completely block Rad9 phosphorylation induced by HU, IR, and 4-NQO (data not shown), possibly because Rad9 can be phosphorylated by a number of different PIKKs. To simultaneously inhibit ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK, K562 cells were preincubated with a combination of wortmannin and caffeine. Cells were then treated with IR, HU, or 4-NQO. To assess the effectiveness of the drug mixture in blocking checkpoint signaling, we examined Chk1 and Chk2 activation by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-specific antibodies that recognize activated Chk1 and Chk2 (Fig.3 A). All three genotoxins triggered Chk1 activation, whereas only IR and 4-NQO induced Chk2 activation. Wortmannin and caffeine pretreatment blocked Chk1 and Chk2 activation, demonstrating that PIKK activity was fully inhibited. We then examined whether PIKK inhibition affected Rad9 chromatin binding in response to IR, HU, and UV. Rad9 was extracted sequentially with low and high salt buffers to separate unbound from chromatin-bound Rad9. The chromatin-bound fractions were then analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 B). In control cells, there was a small amount of Rad9 bound to chromatin in the absence of genotoxins (the level of background binding varies among experiments). As expected, all three genotoxins triggered additional Rad9 chromatin binding, with the most modified form heavily induced. Pretreatment with the PIKK inhibitor drug combination completely blocked the genotoxin-induced Rad9 mobility shifts, demonstrating that the Rad9 modifications required PIKK activity. Despite complete inhibition of the inducible Rad9 mobility shifts by caffeine and wortmannin pretreatment, genotoxin-induced Rad9 chromatin binding was induced by all three genotoxins. Rad1 is also phosphorylated in response to genotoxins, and this phosphorylation is detected as reduced mobility when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (16Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we also asked whether Rad1-inducible phosphorylation was required for Rad1 chromatin binding (Fig.3 C). As was observed with Rad9, wortmannin and caffeine pretreatment blocked Rad1 phosphorylation. However, Rad1 chromatin binding was not affected by PIKK inhibition. Collectively, the results presented in Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that genotoxin-induced phosphorylation of 9-1-1 complex subunits is not required for 9-1-1 chromatin binding. The results presented above indicate that 9-1-1 chromatin binding is independent of PIKK activity. However, a recent study demonstrated that inhibition of DNA replication induced Hus1 binding in a DNA polymerase α-dependent manner, demonstrating that the Rad17-RFC clamp-loading complex, which loads the 9-1-1 clamp, might be recruited to stalled replication forks (17You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that the upstream sensor for DNA damage is a stalled replication fork. Once stalled, the DNA replication machinery is postulated to recruit Rad17-RFC to load the 9-1-1 complex, which, coupled with ATR recruitment, activates the checkpoint signaling cascade. Because DNA lesions physically block replication fork progression, these results raise the possibility that DNA lesions are first sensed by the moving replication fork. To address whether DNA lesion-induced 9-1-1 chromatin binding was dependent upon DNA replication, we determined whether genotoxins triggered Rad9 chromatin binding in cell populations deficient in S-phase cells. We generated a G1-enriched cell population by depriving the interleukin-3-dependent myeloid cell line 32D/Bcl-XL of interleukin-3. Comparison of the exponentially growing and factor-deprived cell populations revealed that the exponentially growing population contained 27% S-phase cells and that the factor-deprived population contained 2% S-phase cells. Both cell populations were treated with IR, HU, or 4-NQO and analyzed for Rad9 chromatin binding (Fig. 4). The replication inhibitor HU triggered Rad9 chromatin binding in the exponentially growing cells. However, because the factor-deprived cells were in G1, HU did not induce Rad9 chromatin binding or Rad9 modification, confirming that very few cells were in S-phase in the factor-deprived population. In contrast, both IR and 4-NQO converted Rad9 to the chromatin-bound form in the factor-deprived population, although Rad9 chromatin binding was slightly less efficient. Thus, these results demonstrate that 9-1-1 chromatin binding does not require stalled replication forks in the face of other types of DNA damage, although they contribute in the case of HU-induced replicative stress. Rad9, Hus1, Rad1, and Rad17 are key participants in the complex checkpoint signaling pathways activated by genotoxins. Although an elegant biochemical model has been presented describing the functions of these proteins, it remains unclear how these protein complexes are regulated (13Venclovas C. Thelen M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2481-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In the present studies we examined the roles of other checkpoint signaling proteins and the DNA replication apparatus in the binding of the 9-1-1 complex to DNA in response to a panel of genotoxic agents. Our studies demonstrated that 9-1-1 chromatin binding does not require PIKK catalytic activity, nor does it require DNA replication. Taken together, these results suggest that the loading of the 9-1-1 complex onto DNA is a proximal event in the activation of the checkpoint signaling pathways. Previous work showed that IR induced Rad9 Ser-272 phosphorylation in an ATM-dependent manner, and this phosphorylation has been implicated in the G1-S phase checkpoint (18Chen M.J. Lin Y.T. Lieberman H.B. Chen G. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16580-16586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether this phosphorylation event might regulate Rad9 by affecting its interaction with its binding partners or with DNA. Modification of Ser-272 did not alter the interaction of Rad9 with Hus1, Rad1, or Rad17. Moreover, Ser-272 phosphorylation had no effect on 9-1-1 chromatin binding in response to IR or other genotoxins. Taken in context with the studies demonstrating a role for Ser-272 phosphorylation in checkpoint activation, our studies suggest that this phosphorylation event may regulate a downstream, Rad9-dependent signaling event. We also identified additional genotoxin-induced post-translational modifications on Rad9. Although these modifications are most likely due to phosphorylation, we did not attempt to verify this possibility because Rad9 is heavily constitutively phosphorylated, which induces a dramatic mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (18Chen M.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and it is unlikely that a phosphatase would selectively affect only this inducible site. Recent studies, using a conditional ATR knockout approach, demonstrated that UV-induced Rad9 chromatin association was independent of ATR (7Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, because Rad9 is phosphorylated by ATM (18Chen M.J. Lin Y.T. Lieberman H.B. Chen G. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16580-16586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and ATM is also activated by UV irradiation (30Oakley G.G. Loberg L.I. Yao J. Risinger M.A. Yunker R.L. Zernik-Kobak M. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Carty M.P. Dixon K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), loss of ATR may not disrupt all PIKK-dependent signals impinging upon the 9-1-1 complex. Thus, we used a complementary pharmacological approach to address the roles of the PIKKs in 9-1-1 chromatin binding in mammalian cells. These results demonstrated that the PIKK inhibitor mixture, which completely blocked genotoxin-induced Chk1, Chk2, Rad9, and Rad1 phosphorylation, did not block 9-1-1 chromatin binding, demonstrating that the clamp-loading reaction does not require PIKK activity. A recent report demonstrated that Hus1 chromatin binding in response to replication inhibition required DNA polymerase α, suggesting that stalled replication forks signal the recruitment of the 9-1-1 checkpoint complex (17You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because many DNA lesions induce 9-1-1 chromatin binding, and these same lesions also slow or block replication, it was possible that stalled replication forks are the sole signal for DNA lesion-induced 9-1-1 chromatin binding. In such a scenario, the DNA replication complex may be the sensor that triggers 9-1-1 chromatin binding. However, the fact that 9-1-1 chromatin binding occurred in cell populations that were nearly devoid of S-phase cells demonstrates that Rad17-RFC responds to other DNA structures, possibly recognizing DNA lesions directly. The results presented here demonstrate that genotoxin-induced 9-1-1 chromatin binding does not require PIKK catalytic activity or DNA replication forks, suggesting that, in the absence of replication, Rad17 may directly recognize DNA lesions produced by genotoxins. Rad17-RFC then loads the 9-1-1 complex onto the DNA where Rad9 is further phosphorylated by PIKK family members that are independently recruited to the DNA lesions. PIKK-dependent phosphorylation of chromatin-bound Rad9 and Rad1 then potentially orchestrates the activation of Chk1 and other downstream checkpoint signaling events. We thank Drs.

Microbiol. 1990; 136: 663-671Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and the cefD gene encoding this protein was cloned from both microorganisms (22Kovacevick S. Tobin M.B. Miller J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3952-3958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Coque J.J.R. Liras P. Martı́n J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Repeated attempts to clone the homologous cefD gene of A. chrysogenum using as probe the bacterial cefD gene or oligonucleotides based on bacterial epimerase conserved amino acid regions with the A. chrysogenum preferred codon usage were unsuccessful. 2S. Gutiérrez and J. F. Martı́n, unpublished results. 2S. Gutiérrez and J. F. Martı́n, unpublished results. These results suggested that the fungal IPN epimerization system was different from the bacterial one. In this article, we describe that two genes contain genetic information required for the epimerization step converting isopenicillin N into penicillin N in A. chrysogenum. The corresponding gene products act in a two-protein system described for the first time in antibiotic biosynthesis. The two genes (named cefD1 andcefD2) are completely different from the cefD gene of A. lactamdurans and S. clavuligerus. A. chrysogenum C10 (ATCC 48278), a strain producing high levels of cephalosporin C, was used for the genetic studies. Escherichia coli ESS2231, a β-lactam supersensitive strain, was used for routine cephalosporin bioassays. Escherichia coli DH5α andE. coli WK6 were used for plasmid purification (double-stranded or single-stranded DNA, respectively). All A. chrysogenum strains were first grown in seed medium (24Shen Y.Q. Wolfe S. Demain A.L. Bio/Technology. 1986; 4: 61-64Google Scholar) for 48 h. Ten ml of seed culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of defined production medium (MDFA) (24Shen Y.Q. Wolfe S. Demain A.L. Bio/Technology. 1986; 4: 61-64Google Scholar) in 500-ml triple-baffled flasks. The cultures were incubated at 25 °C in a rotary shaker at 250 rpm. The levels of cephalosporin antibiotics were determined by bioassay using E. coli ESS2231 as the test strain in plates with penicillinase from Bacillus cereus UL1 as described previously (13Gutiérrez S. Velasco J. Fernández F.J. Martı́n J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3056-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Several constructions named pCD4.5, pCD1, pCD2, and pCD1+2 were obtained from plasmid pJL43 (9Gutiérrez S. Dı́ez B. Álvarez E. Martı́n J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2354-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). pD4.5 was obtained from pJL43 by inserting a 6.8-kb SalI fragment bearing the cefD1, cefD2, and bidirectional promoter region (see Fig. 5). SalI andBglII restriction sites were introduced by in vitro mutagenesis in the cefD1 and cefD2 genes, respectively. Finally, the hygromycin resistance (hph) cassette, subcloned from pAN7-1 (25Punt P.J. Dingemanse M.A. Kuyvenhoven A. Soede R.D. Pouwles P.H. van den Hondel C.C.A.A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), was inserted in the BglII site to inactivate the cefD2 gene. PCD1+2 was obtained by inserting a 5.8-kbBamHI-EcoRV fragment bearing the cefD1 and cefD2 genes into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pC43 (26Gutiérrez S. Marcos A.T. Casqueiro J. Kosalková K. Fernández F.J. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). pCD1 bearing the cefD1 gene was constructed by partial digestion of pCD1+2 with SacI and religation. pCD2 contains a 3.5-kb BamHI-SalI fragment bearing the cefD2 gene inserted into theBamHI-EcoRI site of pC43. Transformation of A. chrysogenum protoplasts was performed as described previously (27Gutiérrez S. Dı́ez B. Alvarez E. Barredo J.L. Martı́n J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were subcloned into pBluescript SK+, and a nested set of fragments was generated with the Erase-a-base procedure (Promega) by digestion with exonuclease III (28Henikoff S. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 28: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (2831) Google Scholar). The fragments were sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (29Sanger F. Nicken S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52497) Google Scholar). To elucidate the presence of putative introns in the DNA sequence of thecefD2 gene, the DNA region containing the expected intron splicing sites was amplified by RT-PCR (Invitrogen) using RNA ofA. chrysogenum 48-h cultures as template with the primers 4A (TATCCGGCAAGCTTGGTCGTAGAG) and 4B (CTTGCGTGAGGGGCGGATGC). The amplified region was sequenced to confirm the presence of the intron. The nucleotide sequence is deposited in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank under the accession number AJ507632. In vitro mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by following the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides A1 (5′-CCGCTGCCTACCGTCGACGCCAAGC-3′) and A2 (5′-GCTTGGCGTCGACGGTAGGCAGCGG-3′) were used in the formation of aSalI site in the cefD1 gene. Similarly, a BglII site in the cefD2 gene was obtained with the oligonucleotides B1 (5′-GGCGCCATAGATCTGCCAAGAGCATGC-3′) and B2 (5′-GCATGCTCTTGGCAGATCTATGGCGCC-3′). Genomic DNA of A. chrysogenum was isolated as described previously (27Gutiérrez S. Dı́ez B. Alvarez E. Barredo J.L. Martı́n J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Three μg of genomic DNA fromA. chrysogenum C10 or its transformants were digested withEcoRI and the fragments were resolved in a 0.7% agarose gel. The gel was blotted onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with different probes (see “Results”) labeled with [32P]dCTP (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total A. chrysogenum RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was resolved by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and blotted onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences) as described by Sambrook et al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridization probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by nick translation and purified by filtration through Wizard minicolumns (Promega). Hybridizations were carried out as described by Sambrooket al. (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The intensity of the hybridization bands was determined by using a phosphor imager scanner (Instant Imager; Packard). Cephalosporin C analysis was performed in a Beckman System Gold HPLC equipped with a μBondapack C18 column as described previously (31Gutiérrez S. Velasco J. Marcos A.T. Fernández F.J. Fierro F. Dı́ez B. Barredo J.L. Martı́n J.F. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1997; 48: 606-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Kosalková K. Marcos A.T. Martı́n J.F. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 27: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). HPLC identification of isopenicillin N and penicillin N was performed as described by Neuss et al. (33Neuss N. Berry D.M. Kupka J. Demain A.L. Queener S.W. Duckworth D.C. Huckstep L.L. J. Antibiot. 1982; 35: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Isopenicillin N and penicillin N (500 μg/ml) were derivatized with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-glucopyranosyl isotiocyanate (GITC) (2 mg/ml in acetonitrile) for 2 h at pH 8.5 (adjusted with sodium bicarbonate). The HPLC separation was performed in a Beckman System Gold HPLC equipped with a μBondpack C18 column with a mobile phase of methanol/acetonitrile/acetic acid/water (36:7:2:55) with a flow of 1.2 ml/min. The IPN epimerase assay was performed as described by Lübbe et al. (34Lübbe C. Wolfe S. Demain A.L. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1986; 23: 367-368Google Scholar). IPN epimerase activity was determined by measuring the in vitro conversion of isopenicillin into penicillin N. The results were quantified by a coupled reaction by determining the conversion of IPN into cephalosporin C (CPC). Cell-free extracts were prepared from A. chrysogenum cultures grown for 72 h. The enzymatic activity was expressed in units/mg of protein. One unit is the activity forming 1 ng of CPC/min in the coupled assay. The specific activity is given as units/mg of protein. Total protein concentration in the cell extract was measured by the Bradford assay. Since the genes encoding all other proteins involved in CPC biosynthesis are clustered in two separate loci, we hypothesized that the gene encoding the protein(s) involved in the conversion of isopenicillin N into penicillin N might be located in one of the two cephalosporin gene clusters. Recently, we have reported that a gene,cefT, located in the early cephalosporin cluster downstream from pcbAB, encoding a multidrug efflux pump protein causes a significant increase of cephalosporin C production (35Ullán R.V. Liu G. Casqueiro J. Gutiérrez S. Bañuelos O. Martı́n J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2002; 267: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To search for genes located on the other side of the early cluster downstream from the pcbC gene, a transcript map of this region was made using RNA extracted from mycelia of A. chrysogenum grown for 48 h in MDFA medium, since at this time the expression of other CPC biosynthetic genes is known to be high in this cephalosporin-overproducing strain (36Velasco J. Gutiérrez S. Fernández F.J. Marcos A.T. Arenós C. Martı́n J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 985-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Five probes, P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 (Fig. 2 A), covering 9 kb downstream of the pcbC gene were used. Results showed (Fig. 2 B) the presence of three transcript signals. Probe P1 gave rise to a 1.15-kb hybridization band, coinciding with the known size of the transcript of the pcbC gene (26Gutiérrez S. Marcos A.T. Casqueiro J. Kosalková K. Fernández F.J. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Probes P2 and P3 highlighted a hybridizing RNA of 1.2 kb, and probes P4 and P5 gave a hybridizing transcript of 2.0 kb (Fig. 2 B), indicating the presence in this region of two open reading frames named ORF1 and ORF2. A 5.8-kb BamHI-EcoRV fragment containing ORF1 and ORF2 was cloned in the pBluescript KS+ and sequenced on both strands. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of two open reading frames. ORF1 has 2193 nucleotides, and it is interrupted by the presence of five introns. This gene was also cloned from a previously constructed cDNA library (37Velasco J. Gutiérrez S. Casqueiro J. Fierro F. Campoy S. Martı́n J.F. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 57: 300-356Google Scholar), and the sequence confirmed the presence of the five introns. ORF1 encoded a protein of 642 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 71 kDa. The encoded protein showed similarity to long chain acyl-CoA synthetases (Fig. 3), particularly those from Homo sapiens (26.3% identical amino acids), Rattus norvegicus (25.5% identity), and Mus musculus (25.5% identity) (38Uchiyama A. Aoyama T. Kamijo K. Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30360-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The ORF1-encoded protein has all the characteristic motifs of the acyl-CoA ligases involved in the activation (usually through an adenylation step) of the carboxyl group of fatty acids or amino acids (39Turgay K. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). ORF2 consists of 1146 nucleotides, and it is interrupted by the presence of one intron. RT-PCR studies using RNA from 48-h cultures ofA. chrysogenum C10 confirmed the presence of the intron. A DNA band of the expected size (92 bp), assuming the splicing of the intron, was obtained by RT-PCR. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified DNA band showed that the intron had been removed at the splicing sites corresponding to nucleotides 64–157 numbered from the ATG translation initiation codon. ORF2 encoded a protein of 383 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 41.4 kDa. The encoded protein showed (Fig. 4) similarity to α-methyl-acyl-CoA racemases, particularly those from H. sapiens (42.1% identical amino acid) M. musculus(39.4% identity) and R. norvegicus (39.3%) (40Reichel C. Brugger R. Bang H. Geisslinger G. Brune K. Mol. Phamacol. 1997; 51: 76-582Google Scholar, 41Schmitz W. Helander H.M. Hiltunen J.K. Conzelmann E. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To study the role of the proteins encoded by ORF1 and ORF2 in cephalosporin C biosynthesis, targeted inactivation of both genes was performed with the double marker technique (42Mansour S.L. Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1988; 336: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar) developed for targeted inactivation in A. chrysogenum (43Liu G. Casqueiro J. Bañuelos O. Cardoza R.E. Gutiérrez S. Martı́n J.F. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To perform targeted inactivation of these genes, plasmid pD4.5 was constructed (Fig. 5 A); this plasmid carries an incomplete ORF2 (obtained by insertion of the hygromycin resistance cassette) and ORF1 inactivated by a frameshift mutation introduced in vitro. Plasmid pD4.5 contains also the bleomycin resistance marker (Fig. 5). Plasmid pD4.5 was transformed into A. chrysogenum C10, and transformants were selected by the resistance to hygromycin B. The transformants were screened for those clones showing a hygRphleS phenotype, indicating that double recombination had occurred. Thirty-three transformants of the 250 clones tested showed the hygR phleS phenotype. All of these 33 transformants were tested for cephalosporin production by the agar plug method. Nine transformants showed a drastic reduction in the cephalosporin production, and seven additional transformants showed no cephalosporin production at all as compared with A. chrysogenum C10, suggesting that targeted inactivation had occurred in the mutants. To confirm that targeted inactivation took place at the right position, the seven nonproducing transformants and two others with drastic reduction in cephalosporin production were analyzed by Southern blot.A. chrysogenum C10 and one transformant (Fig. 5 B,lane 8) with no reduction in cephalosporin production were used as controls. The DNA of all strains was digested with SalI and hybridized with a probe internal to the bidirectional promoter region located between ORF1 and ORF2 (Fig.5 A). Results showed that the A. chrysogenum C10 (Fig. 5 B, lane 11) hybridized with a genomic DNA band of 6.8 kb; however, in transformants with no cephalosporin production (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3–7, 9, and 10), the 6.8-kb hybridization band was converted into a band of 3.8 kb, as expected, by a canonical double recombination (Fig. 5 A). In transformants with a drastic reduction in cephalosporin production (Fig.5 B, lanes 1 and 2) the 6.8 kb is converted into a 5.0-kb hybridization signal, suggesting that a noncanonical recombination process had occurred at the ORF1-ORF2 locus. By contrast, in the transformant with no reduction in cephalosporin production (Fig. 5 B, lane 8), two hybridization bands of 3.8 and 6.8 kb were present, suggesting an ectopical integration of the pD4.5 plasmid. To study in more detail the effect of targeted inactivation of the ORF1 and ORF2, three transformants named TD167, TD189, and TD234 (lanes 3, 5, and 10 in Fig. 5 B) were selected. To study whether proteins encoded by ORF1 and ORF2 were involved in the conversion of isopenicillin N into penicillin N, the epimerase activity was measured in cell extracts of three disrupted transformants (TD167, TD189, and TD234) and the parental strain A. chrysogenum C10. Results showed that the epimerase activity was absent in the ORF1-ORF2-disrupted strains, both at 72 and 96 h, whereas theA. chrysogenum C10 strained a high level of IPN epimerase activity (92 units/mg of protein) at 72 h. These results clearly indicated that the proteins encoded by the ORF1 and ORF2 are involved in the epimerization step in cephalosporin C biosynthesis. Thus, the corresponding genes have been namedcefD1 and cefD2 according to standard β-lactam gene nomenclature, since the designation cefD is used to describe the bacterial epimerase gene (44Martı́n J.F. Ingolia T.D. Queener S.W. Leong S.A. Berka R. Molecular Industrial Mycology. Marcel Dekker, New York1990: 149-195Google Scholar). If cefD1 and cefD2 encode the IPN epimerase, the TD167, TD189, and TD234 mutants should accumulate isopenicillin N. Results showed (Fig.6 A) that no cephalosporins were detected by bioassay in any of the disrupted strains, whereas in the same culture conditions high cephalosporin production was observed in either A. chrysogenum C10 or in the nondisrupted transformant. Analysis by HPLC of the culture broth supernatant (Fig.6 B) showed that the disrupted strains formed no traces of cephalosporin C, whereas in A. chrysogenum C10 cephalosporin C is produced. The culture filtrates from the three disrupted strains, TD167, TD189, and TD234, and the parental A. chrysogenum C10 were treated with GITC (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the derivatized compounds were resolved by HPLC. Results showed that inA. chrysogenum C10 culture broth the peaks corresponding to both isopenicillin N and penicillin N were present (Fig.7). However, in the three disrupted strains, the peak corresponding to penicillin N is absent, and at the same time there is an accumulation of isopenicillin N, confirming the previous evidence indicating that disrupted strains are blocked in isopenicillin N epimerase. To elucidate whether both the acyl-CoA synthetase and the acyl-racemase encoded by cefD1 and cefD2 or just one of them were involved in the conversion of isopenicillin N into penicillin N, a series of complemented strains lacking one or both of these genes was created. For this purpose, plasmids pCD1, pCD2, and pCD1+2 bearing thecefD1, cefD2, or both genes, respectively, were constructed (Fig. 8). These three plasmids were transformed separately in the TD189 deletion mutant, and transformants were selected by resistance to phleomycin. Five transformants (TCD1) obtained with the pCD1 plasmids were selected, and their genomic DNA digested with SacI was hybridized with a 1-kb fragment of thecefD1-cefD2 bidirectional promoter region (Fig.5) as probe. Results showed (Fig. 8 A) that all five transformants gave hybridization with a DNA band of 4.5 kb in addition to the endogenous 6.6-kb hybridization band (corresponding to the disrupted gene in the host TD189 strain), indicating that the insert of the plasmid pCD1 was intact. Similarly, five transformants (TCD2) obtained with the pCD2 plasmid were selected, and their DNA was digested with a mixture ofSpeI and ClaI and hybridized with the same probe (1 kb of the promoter region) as above. Results showed (Fig.8 B) a hybridization band of 5 kb in several transformants, indicating that the insert of plasmid pCD2 is intact. The large 24-kb hybridization band corresponded to the endogenous hybridizing band in the cefD1-cefD2 disrupted clone (TD189;lane 5), whereas the wild type A. chrysogenum gave a 20-kb hybridization band. Finally, the DNA of three transformants (TCD1+2) obtained with the pCD1+2 plasmid was digested with a mixture of SpeI and ClaI and hybridized with the same 1-kb probe as above. Results showed (Fig. 8 C) that the probe hybridized with a band of 7.3 kb, indicating that the insert of the plasmid pCD1+2 was integrated in an intact form. The 24-kb hybridization band corresponded to the endogenous hybridizing band in thecefD1-cefD2-disrupted clone (TD189). To study which of the two ORFs were responsible for the epimerization step, the IPN epimerase activity was measured in three representative transformants TCD1, TCD2, and TCD1+2. Results showed (TableI) that only in A. chrysogenumTCD1+2 transformants (where cefD1 andcefD2 are present) was the epimerase activity restored. In transformants TCD1 and TCD2, where just one of the genes was functional, no epimerase activity was detected. These results indicate that both cefD1 and cefD2 proteins are indeed involved in the epimerization of isopenicillin N into penicillin N.Table IIsopenicillin N epimerase activity in transformants TCD1+2, TCD1, and TCD2 derived from TD189 by complementation with cefD1+2, cefD1 and cefD2 genes, respectivelyStrainGenotypeEpimerase activityunits/mg of proteinA. chrysogenum C10Wild type92A. chrysogenum TD189cefD1−,cefD2::hph0A. chrysogenum TCD1+2-115Wild type105A. chrysogenumTCD1-8cefD2::hph0A. chrysogenumTCD2-49cefD1−0The strains were grown in MDFA medium and mycelia were collected at 72 h.

Three different clones from each strain were assayed with identical results. Cephalosporin C fermentations with three of the TCD1, TCD2, and TCD1+2 transformants were performed. Results showed (Fig.9 A) that in transformants TCD1+2, the cephalosporin production was restored to levels similar to those of A. chrysogenum C10. In TCD1transformants (Fig. 9 B), a very small amount of cephalosporins production was detected (∼1% of cephalosporin produced in A. chrysogenum C10), whereas in TCD2transformants (Fig. 9 B), no cephalosporin was produced at all. HPLC analysis (Fig. 9 C) confirmed that TCD1+2 transformants produced authentic cephalosporin C as in A. chrysogenum C10. d-Amino acids are very frequent components of nonribosomal peptides (45Kleinkauf H. von Döhren H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 335-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 46Martı́n J.F. Gutiérrez S. Aparicio J.F. Lederberg J. Encyclopedia of Microbiology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2000: 213-237Google Scholar) and their derivatives (e.g.β-lactams). Very little is known about the mechanism of amino acid epimerization that give rise to the d-configuration. In many cases, epimerization is performed by an epimerization domain integrated into the large modular peptide synthetases (8Martı́n J.F. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2000; 53: 1008-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 47Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 125: 3-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in other cases, the d-amino acids are formed by separate epimerases (e.g. the d-alanine component of cyclosporin and HC toxin) (48Cheng Y.-Q. Walton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4906-4911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this work, we report that the epimerization step converting isopenicillin N into penicillin N in A. chrysogenum is catalyzed by a two-protein system never described before in the biosynthesis of antibiotics or other secondary metabolites. These proteins are encoded by two genes expressed in opposite orientation from a bidirectional promoter region: cefD1, which shows high similarity to long chain acyl-CoA synthetases (39Turgay K. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 529-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), andcefD2, showing high similarity to acyl-CoA racemases (49Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 50Schmitz W. Albers C. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A mechanism of action of the A. chrysogenum two-component IPN epimerase system can be proposed on the basis of homology of the CefD1 and CefD2 proteins with known eucaryotic epimerases. Such epimerization systems that require previous activation of the substrate as CoA-derivatives have been reported to be involved in the racemization of phytanic acid and in the inversion of ibuprofen in humans. Phytanic acid occurs naturally as a mixture of the (3R)- and the (3S)-diastereoisomers and is converted after α-oxidation into pristanic acid (51Ackman R.G. Hansen R.P. Lipids. 1967; 2: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 52Fingerhut R. Schmitz W. Conzelmann E. J. Inherited Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The oxidases and dehydrogenases responsible for further β-oxidation of phytanic acid act only on (2S)-2-methylacyl-CoAs (53van Veldhoven P.P. Croes K. Asselberghs S. Herdewijn P. Mannaerts G.P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 54Schmitz W. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and a racemization step is required for complete degradation. In summary, α-methyl-branched fatty acids are racemized as CoA thioesters by a specific α-methylacyl-CoA racemase similar to the protein encoded bycefD2 (49Schmitz W. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 50Schmitz W. Albers C. Fingerhut R. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Another example is the epimerization of the 2-arylpropionic acids (e.g. ibuprofen), an important group of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A unique feature regarding 2-arylpropionic acid metabolism is the stereoselective conversion of theR-enantiomer to its S-diastereomer but not vice versa (55Caldwell J. Hutt A.J. Fournel-Gigleux S. Biochem. Pharmcacol. 1988; 37: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The pathway for this metabolic event begins with the activation of the 2-arylpropionic acids as an acyl-CoA by an acyl-CoA synthetase (that resembles the protein encoded by cefD1) that is later racemized by a 2-arylpropionyl-CoA epimerase, and finally theS-diastereoisomer is released by a thioesterase (56Knihinicki R.D. Day R.O. Williams K.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 57Shieh W.R. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3487-3493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2-arylpropionyl-CoA epimerase has been purified from rat liver (57Shieh W.R. Chen C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3487-3493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showing that it is similar to α-methylacyl-CoA racemases (54Schmitz W. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As shown in this work, the protein encoded by the cefD2 has high similarity to α-methylacyl-racemases and 2-arylpropionyl-CoA epimerases, suggesting that after activation of isopenicillin N to isopenicillinyl-CoA by an isopenicillin-adenylate-mediated mechanism, epimerization to penicillinyl-CoA occurs by a similar mechanism (Fig.10). Our results show that the product of both genes cefD1 andcefD2 are necessary for full epimerase activity and for cephalosporin biosynthesis, which supports the proposed activation and epimerization model. Finally, the required hydrolysis of the CoA thioesters has been reported to occur in a nonstereoselective manner by different thioesterases (56Knihinicki R.D. Day R.O. Williams K.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 42: 1905-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The Streptomyces clavuligerus and Amycolatopsis lactamdurans isopenicillin N epimerases appear to work by an entirely different mechanism, since they are single proteins with a molecular weight of 59,000 (for the A. lactamdurans) or 63,000 (for the S. clavuligerus enzyme) that catalyze a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent removal of the amino group at C-2 of the α-aminoadipyl chain, followed by reintroduction in the d-configuration (19Jensen S.E.

https://openalex.org/W1980256159,"The suprabasin gene is a novel gene expressed in mouse and human differentiating keratinocytes. We identified a partial cDNA encoding suprabasin using a suppression subtractive hybridization method between the proliferative basal and differentiating suprabasal populations of the mouse epidermis. A 3′ gene-specific probe hybridized to transcripts of 0.7- and 2.2-kb pairs on Northern blots with specific detection in differentiated keratinocytes of stratified epithelia. The mouse gene was mapped to chromosome 7 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. This region is syntenic to human chromosome band 19q13.1, which contained the only region in the data bases with homology to the mouse suprabasin sequence. During embryonic mouse development, suprabasin mRNA was detected at day 15.5, coinciding with epidermal stratification. Suprabasin was detected in the suprabasal layers of the epithelia in the tongue, stomach, and epidermis. Differentiation of cultured primary epidermal keratinocytes with 0.12 mm Ca2+ or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment resulted in the induction of suprabasin. The 2.2-kb cDNA transcript encodes a protein of 72 kDa with a predicted isoelectric point of 6.85. The translated sequence has an amino-terminal domain, a central domain composed of repeats rich in glycine and alanine, and a carboxyl-terminal domain. The alternatively spliced 0.7-kb transcript encodes a smaller protein that shares the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions but lacks the repeat domain region. Cross-linking experiments indicate that suprabasin is a substrate for transglutaminase 2 and 3 activity.

Altogether, these results indicate that the suprabasin protein potentially plays a role in the process of epidermal differentiation. Cells losing contact with the underlying basement membrane will undergo differentiation to form the mature epidermis. During mouse development, at day 14 the stratified epidermal layers begin to appear, and the keratinocytes follow a complex program of differentiation with the formation of the spinous and granular layers, leading to a highly stratified, water impermeable barrier at birth on day 19 (1, 2). The final phase of this complex differentiation program is the formation of cornified envelopes (CE). 1The abbreviations used are: CE, cornified envelope; EDC, epidermal differentiation complex; E, embryonic day; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; FISH, fluorescence in situ hybridization; SSH, suppression subtractive hybridization; NHEK, human keratinocyte; CaM, calmodulin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; TGase, transglutaminase; EST, expressed sequence tag; aa, amino acid(s); GF, GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I); H89, N-[2–99p-bromocinnamyl-0-amino-0-ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide; KN62, 1-[N,O-bis-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-l-tyrosyl]- 4-phenylpiperazine.This process includes granular cell death, destruction of all organelles, ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide covalent cross-linking of cornified envelope precursors through the action of calcium-dependent transglutaminases (TGases), and attachment of lipid molecules to the cross-linked envelope (3Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1657-1666Google Scholar, 4Kalinin A. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3069-3070Google Scholar). In the last two decades, a group of epidermal-specific genes that are components of the CE have been identified and characterized (reviewed in Refs. 5Presland R.B. Dale B.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 383-408Google Scholar, 6Robinson N.A. Lapic S. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12035-12046Google Scholar, 7Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Google Scholar). In humans, many of these epidermal genes are closely linked in a 2.5-Mbp region, located in chromosome 1q21, that has been termed the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) (8Volz A. Korge B.P. Compton J.G. Ziegler A. Steinert P.M. Mischke D. Genomics. 1993; 18: 92-99Google Scholar). Several of the reported mouse homolog genes have been mapped to the murine EDC in a syntenic region of chromosome 3. Three types of protein families that contribute to the cornification process are clustered in the EDC (9Mischke D. Korge B.P. Marenholz I. Volz A. Ziegler A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 989-992Google Scholar). The first, with proteins such as involucrin, loricrin, late envelope proteins, and small proline-rich proteins, is characterized by relatively small sizes with short tandem peptide repeats in the central region. The second family (fused-type), represented by profilaggrin and repetin, has EF-hand domains (Ca2+-binding domains) at the NH2-terminal region followed by multiple tandem repeats. The third family is represented by members of the S100 family and is characterized by presenting Ca2+-binding EF-hand domains. There are other epidermal genes that are incorporated into the CE that do not localize to the EDC, such as those for sciellin, envoplakin, and periplakin (10Champliaud M.F. Burgeson R.E. Jin W. Baden H.P. Olson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31547-31554Google Scholar, 11Maatta A. Ruhrberg C. Watt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19857-19865Google Scholar, 12Aho S. McLean W.H. Li K. Uitto J. Genomics. 1998; 48: 242-247Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the cell envelope formation is a highly coordinated process in which cross-linking of specific groups of proteins occur in a sequential order (4Kalinin A. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3069-3070Google Scholar). In recent reports from targeting experiments it has become clear that, in the absence of major envelope precursor proteins, other factor(s) are able to substitute or replace their function to culminate in the formation of a normal or “quasi-normal” cornified envelope (13Jarnik M. de Viragh P.A.

Recently, additional genes have been identified by different approaches: subtractive hybridization, rapid analysis of gene expression, positional cloning, and EST data base searches (17Zhao X.P. Elder J.T. Genomics. 1997; 45: 250-258Google Scholar, 18Marenholz I. Zirra M. Fischer D.F. Backendorf C. Ziegler A. Mischke D. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 341-355Google Scholar, 19Marshall D. Hardman M.J.

Morohashi M. Huh N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47445-47452Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that some of these newly characterized proteins would be able to compensate in function for other well known CE precursors (13Jarnik M. de Viragh P.A. Scharer E. Bundman D. Simon M.N. Roop D.R. Steven A.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 102-109Google Scholar, 19Marshall D. Hardman M.J. Nield K.M. Byrne C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13031-13036Google Scholar). The novel suprabasin, which we have characterized in this study, is structurally similar to involucrin and loricrin; the open reading frame codes for a small protein rich in glycine, with short tandem repeats in the central region. The suprabasin gene is expressed in vivoin the differentiating layers of cornifying epithelia, and the expression can be induced in vitro by treatment of keratinocytes with Ca2+ or with TPA, dependent on PKC signaling. We propose that suprabasin is a new member of the epidermal-specific proteins that is a substrate for TGase activity and potentially plays a role in the epidermal differentiation process. SSH (Clontech; Ref. 22Diatchenko L. Lukyanov S. Lau Y.F. Siebert P.D. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 303: 349-380Google Scholar) was performed following instructions of the manufacturer using basal cell RNA as a “driver” and suprabasal cell RNA as “tester.” The primary mouse basal and suprabasal keratinocytes were obtained from neonatal skins that were trypsinized overnight at 4 °C, and separated by a discontinuous Percoll gradient (23Lichti U. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 74-81Google Scholar). From this screen, we identified a partial cDNA sequence (262 bp) that corresponded to part of the COOH-terminal end and 3′-untranslated region of suprabasin (nucleotides 2014–2277). The complete cDNA sequence was obtained performing 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (Clontech). A canonical polyadenylation signal and poly(A)+ tail were identified at the 3′ end. The complete mRNA sequence was deposited in GenBankTM (accession no.AY115494). To determine the transcription start site, we performed the RACE method using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). The gene-specific oligonucleotide (5′-CTGCCCGGGCAGGCAGAGTCCC-3′) utilized was located at +100 bp from the putative translation initiation AUG in the coding sequence of suprabasin. The final PCR product was cloned and sequenced to determine the 5′ mRNA sequence. A genomic DNA region of ∼110 kb was cloned through screening of a mouse VJ/129 BAC library (Genome Systems Inc.) using a 1.7-kb suprabasin cDNA as a probe. To analyze the genomic structure of the suprabasin gene, we performed PCR with the oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′ end and 3′ end of cDNA and the BAC genomic DNA as a template. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences determined the exon/intron boundaries and the sizes of intronic regions. To obtain further 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream sequence, we used a Chromosome Walking kit (Clontech) with gene-specific primers and genomic mouse DNA following the instructions specified by the manufacturer. We used BLAST analysis for sequence homology searches, made available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). The genomic mouse suprabasin BAC clone was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP by nick translation (carried out by Genome Systems Inc.). The labeled probe was combined with sheared mouse DNA and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from mouse embryo fibroblast cells in a solution containing 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. Specific hybridization signals were detected by incubating the hybridized slides in fluoresceinated antidigoxigenin antibodies followed by counterstaining with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Constructs were prepared by cloning a PCR-amplified coding region of suprabasin tagged with EcoRI and SalI sites into pGEMT-easy (Promega; pGEM/suprabasin) and pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech; pGFP-suprabasin). The truncated sequences were generated by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: RI5′suprabasin (5′-gcggaattctATGTATCTTGTCAGTTTGCTCAGCTCCTGC-3′) and 462Rsuprabasin (5′-gtggtcgacCCCCTGACCAAACTTCCCTGCTTCACTGCC-3′) for pGFP/suprabasin (aa 1–144); RI5′suprabasin and 1304Rsuprabasin (5′-gtggtcgacCAGCCCCTTGCACCAGTCTGCCTC-3′) for pGFP/suprabasin (aa 1–425); RI5′suprabasin and 1924Rsuprabasin (5′-gaggtcgacTCATTTCCTGGCCAGCAGCATGGTGGACAC-3′) for pGFP/suprabasin (aa 1–612); 427Fsuprabasin (5′-gaggaattctTCAGGGGGGCAGTGAAGCAGGGAAG-3′) and 1924Rsuprabasin for pGFP/suprabasin (aa 133–612). Oligonucleotides 427Fsuprabasin and 1304Rsuprabasin were used to generate pGFP/suprabasin (aa 133–425) and RI5′suprabasin and SalI3′suprabasin for the full-length pGFP/suprabasin (aa 1–700). All PCR reactions were performed for 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and extension at 68 °C for 90 s. Primary mouse keratinocytes were isolated from BALB/c trypsinized newborn mouse skins and grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium lacking Ca2+ with 8% Chelex-treated fetal bovine serum (24Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H. Cell. 1980; 19: 245-254Google Scholar, 25Yuspa S.H. Kilkenny A.E. Steinert P.M. Roop D.R. J.

Ca2+concentrations were determined by analysis in an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Unless otherwise indicated, the Ca2+concentration of the medium was adjusted to 0.05 mm to maintain a basal cell-like population of undifferentiated cells. Cells were treated with different kinase inhibitors at 10 μmconcentration for specific time periods. The inhibitors used were: the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (GF, bisindolylmaleimide I, Alexis), the PKA inhibitor H89 (N-[2–99p-bromocinnamyl-0-amino-0-ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide, Alexis), or a CaM kinase II inhibitor (KN62, 1-[N,O-bis-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-N-methyl-l-tyrosyl]-4-phenylpiperazine,Calbiochem). Primary mouse keratinocytes were transfected using the FuGENE6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Typically, 0.5 μg of GFP/suprabasin, GFP/suprabasin truncated constructs, or pEGFP-C1 control construct were transfected into cells plated and cultured in two-well chamber slides coated with rat tail collagen (0.1 mg/ml). After 4 h incubation, the cells were treated with 15% glycerol in KSF medium (Invitrogen) for 3.5 min and then maintained in medium with 0.05, 0.12, or 1.4 mm Ca2+. Human keratinocytes (NHEK) were cultured in vitro in serum-free keratinocyte medium as described by Jang et al.(27Jang S.I. Steinert P.M. Markova N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24105-24114Google Scholar), and were induced to differentiate by increasing the Ca2+ concentration in the media to 1.4 mm or by treatment with the PKC inducer TPA (100 nm). Cells were cultured for different time periods as indicated. Total RNA were isolated from mouse primary basal and suprabasal keratinocytes, and mouse and human keratinocytes differentiated in vitro using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The RNA samples (1–3 μg) were electrophoresed in 1.2% agarose/methymercuryhydroxide gels, electroblotted to nylon membranes, and hybridized according to Church and Gilbert (28Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar). mRNA blots for human and mouse adult tissues were purchased from Clontech and used according to instructions. The probes used were 262-bp coding (mouse) and 500-bp coding (human) suprabasin cDNAs. After exposure, hybridized probes were removed by boiling filters in 0.1× SCC, 0.1% SDS. All blots were re-hybridized with a cDNA probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (29Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M. el Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Google Scholar) to control for RNA loading and integrity. RNA probes corresponding to the sense and antisense strands of mouse suprabasin partial cDNA (262 bp from 2014 to 2277) (pGEMT-easy/3′suprabasin) were prepared using T7 and Sp6 RNA polymerase and 35S-labeled UTP. Sections of mouse embryos were subjected to in situhybridization as described by Mackem and Mahon (Ref. 30Mackem S. Mahon K.A. Development. 1991; 112: 791-806Google Scholar and molecular histology). The region coding for amino acids 1–612 was subcloned into a pET28b vector to generate a recombinant protein. The recombinant clone was overexpressed in BL21(DE3)RIL. The recombinant protein contains a His tag and a T7 tag at the NH2 terminus of the protein. The soluble and insoluble forms of the recombinant protein were purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) and Mono Q-FPLC. We analyzed the predicted protein sequence using the ISREC search tools (www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/), the Baylor College of Medicine Search launcher (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/), and MacVector 6.5.3. To examine the cross-linking activity by TGase, 300 ng of recombinant suprabasin (aa 1–612) was incubated with 0.4 μg and 1.2 μg of TGase 2 (Sigma) or 3 μg and 6 μg of TGase 3 in buffer containing 20 mmCaCl2 and 5 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 6× SDS loading dye and heated at 90 °C for 3min. The products were separated on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Involucrin was included as a positive control for the TGase activity. The gel was electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and an antibody against T7 (Invitrogen) was used in Western analysis to determine the oligomerization of suprabasin by TGase. SSH, a PCR-based cDNA subtraction method (Ref. 31Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Google Scholar; Clontech) was used to compare the basal and suprabasal mRNA populations from neonatal epidermis. From a screen of 96 hybridization selected clones, the sequence of the candidate cDNAs was used to search the data bases, and to determine whether the isolated clones were novel and/or whether they contained motifs found in other factors. Several novel genes as well as known suprabasal-specific genes were identified. We used the partial cDNAs of a selected number of novel genes as probes in Northern blots containing poly(A)+ mRNAs from basal and suprabasal cells separated by Percoll gradients (23Lichti U. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 74-81Google Scholar). Only the cDNAs that hybridized exclusively with the suprabasal mRNA fraction were further characterized. We utilized 5′-RACE methods to obtain the full-coding sequence of the novel suprabasal-specific gene that we termed suprabasin (Fig.1 A). A data base comparison with the full-length or repeat region sequence of suprabasin using the program BLAST did not reveal any homology to known protein sequences. The search of publicly available EST data bases revealed homology to a several overlapping mouse EST sequences (AA530183, AA727702, and 791703). By searching the data base of human genomic sequences, we identified a region in human chromosome 19 with homology to the mouse suprabasin cDNA sequence. To amplify the human homologue of suprabasin, we designed the oligonucleotides corresponding the NH2- and COOH-terminal region of suprabasin, which were conserved between the mouse cDNA sequence and the human genomic DNA sequence (forward, 5′-GAAGGGATCAACCGAGGGCTGAGCAATGCAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCTCATAATGGGGTCAACCAAGCCAGCAAGG-3′). Using a RT-PCR method, we amplified a 500-bp DNA fragment from human skin RNA. Sequencing results showed that amplified fragment is identical to human EST cDNA BG742735. We performed Northern analysis of human suprabasin using the 0.5-kb amplified DNA fragment as a probe. The 2277-bp mouse suprabasin transcript included 30 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence and 144 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence. The transcript had a polyadenylation signal at 2251 bp, a poly (A)+ tail, and one putative open reading frame that translated into a 700-amino acid protein. Analysis of the open reading frame sequence by ISREC search tools (www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/), the Baylor College of Medicine Search launcher (searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/), and MacVector 6.5.3. predicted a protein with a mass of 72 kDa and an isoelectric point for the unmodified protein of 6.85. The programs also identified a potential transmembrane domain in the amino-terminal region (shaded areain Fig. 1 B) and a series of glycine- and histidine-rich short tandem repeats in the central domain (boxed area in Fig. 1 B). Potential PKC phosphorylation sites were identified (underlined in Fig. 1 B). Comparison of the open reading frame to the data bases also revealed 2 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites and 73 potentialN-myristoylation sites. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence surrounding the AUG initiator codon for the suprabasin open reading frame (AACAACATGT) conformed to the consensus sequence for initiation of translation (GCCACCAUGG) in having a purine (A) at position −3, but lacked the consensus G found at position +4 (32Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Google Scholar). Further analysis must be done to determine whether there is a modulation of translation of suprabasin as a result of the primary sequence surrounding the AUG codon. In situ hybridization of sagittal sections of E17.5 mouse embryos showed epidermal-specific expression (Fig.2 A). Higher magnification showed that the expression detected with the antisense mouse suprabasin probe was specific to the suprabasal-differentiated layers of interfollicular trunk and tail epidermis (Fig. 2, D andG). Expression was also detected in the stratified layers in the tongue and palate (Fig. 2 J). In situhybridization of an adult mouse mixed tissue block detected expression only in stomach tissue, with no detectable expression in kidney, liver, brain, spleen, or heart (data not shown). No expression was observed when using the control sense suprabasin probe (Fig. 2, B,E, H, and K). Analysis of suprabasin expression in mouse primary basal and suprabasal keratinocytes isolated by discontinuous Percoll gradient showed specific expression of the suprabasin 2.2-kb transcript in the differentiated epidermal cell layers (Fig.3 A). We identified a smaller 0.7-kb transcript that was also exclusively expressed in the differentiated layer. The 0.7-kb transcript detected by the suprabasin-specific probe in Northern analysis was amplified by RACE using a suprabasin-specific oligonucleotide corresponding to 3′-untranslated region (bp 2133–2277). A 0.7-kb fragment was cloned into the pGEMT-easy vector, and by sequence analysis we determined that this shorter mRNA results from an alternative splicing that occurs between bp 384 and 1993, resulting in a transcript that lacks the coding region for the tandem repeats (Fig. 5 B). The expression of suprabasin was also studied in keratinocytes culturedin vitro (Fig. 3, B and C). Suprabasin expression was detected only after the keratinocytes were induced to differentiate in vitro by incrementing Ca2+concentration. A more detailed time course of induction showed that suprabasin expression was already detectable 4 h after the Ca2+ switch with high expression being reached after 24 h in culture. Treatment of cultured cells with different kinase (PKC, PKA, CaM kinase II) inhibitors showed a specific and complete repression of suprabasin expression with PKC inhibitor treatment (GF; Fig. 3 C). This is reminiscent of results observed for other late epidermal differentiation factors, where expression is dependent on the PKC signaling pathway. No effect on expression was seen with treatment with a PKA inhibitor (H89) and a reproducible partial inhibition was observed with an inhibitor for the CaM kinase II (KN62) (Fig. 3 C). Mouse suprabasin expression was assessed during embryonic development by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 D). Expression was detected at E15 coinciding with stratification of the epidermis and dramatically increased by E17. The early detection at E7 was predicted to be caused by extra-embryonic tissue contribution that is present in the E7 sample. The extra-embryonic contribution in sample E7 was corroborated by re-hybridizing the Northern blot with PL-1, a placental specific marker. Other sites of expression detected from a dot blot analysis of different adult tissues were the uterus and thyroid (data not shown), whereas no expression was found in heart, brain, spleen, lung, liver, smooth muscle, or kidney (Fig.3 E). As mentioned above, we also cloned a partial human suprabasin cDNA and analyzed the expression pattern by Northern blots. We found that human suprabasin is expressed as two transcripts of 2.2 and 1.1 kb . The expression was detected in the skin and in human keratinocytes (NHEK) cultured in vitro (Fig.4 A). A time course of induction for human suprabasin in NHEK showed that, as for the mouse primary keratinocytes, the expression was restricted to cells induced to differentiate in vitro (Fig.4 B). The expression could also be induced by treatment of the cells with TPA, an activator of the PKC signaling pathway. Northern blot analysis of different human tissues showed expression in the esophagus, uterus, and thymus (Fig. 4 C). An initial experiment resulted in specific labeling of the proximal region of which was believed to be chromosome 7 on the basis of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. A second experiment was conducted in which a probe specific for the telomeric region of chromosome 7 was co-hybridized with the genomic BAC suprabasin probe. This experiment resulted in the specific labeling of the telomere and the proximal portion of chromosome 7 (Fig.5 A). Measurements of 10 specifically labeled chromosomes 7 demonstrated that suprabasin is located at a position 19% of the distance from the heterochromatic-euchromatic boundary to the telomere of chromosome 7, an area that corresponds to band 7B2–7B3. A total of 80 metaphase cells were analyzed with 72 exhibiting specific labeling. Search through the human genomic data bases localized only one site with high homology to the mouse suprabasin sequence to chromosome 19q13.1 (AC002389). This region in chromosome 19 is syntenic to the region in the mouse chromosome 7 where suprabasin was localized by FISH mapping. Analysis of the homologous genomic human region predicted exons of good and excellent quality. As can be seen in the Northern blots with both human and mouse tissues, the suprabasin presents two alternatively spliced transcripts (2.2 and 0.7 kb in the mouse and 2.2 and 1.1 kb in the human). By comparison of the gene and cDNA sequences in the mouse, we determined the intronic and coding regions of suprabasin (Fig. 5 B). The intron sizes are 1339 bp for intron 1, 121 bp for intron 2, and 918 bp for intron 3. Alternative splicing between bp 384 and 1993 generates the shorter 0.7-kb splice variant that lacks the coding region for the tandem repeats (Fig. 5 B). Analysis of the proximal promoter region showed that it is AT-rich, lacks CpG islands, and contains a canonical TATA box, and revealed several potential transcription factor binding sites for AP1 and Sp1 (data not shown). To study the intracellular localization of suprabasin, we transfected GFP/suprabasin full-length and truncated fusion constructs into primary mouse keratinocytes (Fig.6). Intracellular localization of GFP fusion proteins was observed by direct fluorescence microscopy. The location of the nucleus was apparent by propidium iodide (PI) staining. The schematic representation of the GFP fusion constructs is in the left panel of Fig. 6and indicates the suprabasin residues that are fused to GFP. Full-length suprabasin localizes in a highly patch-like expression pattern throughout the cytoplasm. To examine whether suprabasin co-localized with cellular organelles, we performed staining for mitochondria with MitoTracker (mitochondrion-selective stains, Molecular Probes) and immunocytochemistry with LAMP1 and -2 (lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein, Santa Cruz). Neither co-localized with GFP/suprabasin expression in the transfected cells (data not shown). We also tested a series of truncated fusion constructs (Fig. 6). The expression of NH2-terminal region GFP/suprabasin-(1–144) resulted in expression throughout the cytoplasm that lacked the patchy phenotype of the COOH-terminal truncated (aa 1–612) or full-length (aa 1–700) fusion constructs. Expression of GFP/suprabasin-(133–425), which contains the first tandem repeat domain had effects on cell viability (data not shown), whereas the GFP/suprabasin-(133–612) that contained the complete tandem repeat region resulted in restricted expression around the nucleus. The expression of NH2 terminus with a partial tandem repeat domain of suprabasin-(1–425) caused a strong dense expression in the cytoplasm. This expression was distinct from the C-terminal truncated (aa 1–612) or the full-length (aa 1–700). GFP control was detected as bright green fluorescence throughout the cell (Fig. 6). We tested whether recombinant suprabasin (aa 1–612) was a substrate for TGase activity. Cross-linking assays were performed with TGase 2 and 3, with recombinant mouse suprabasin. TGase 3 is expressed in epithelia and is a proven participant in CE assembly. The monomeric recombinant suprabasin (aa 1–612) is shown in Fig.7. After incubation at 37 °C with either TGase 2 (0.4 or 1.2 μg) or TGase 3 (3 or 9 μg), the samples were run in a SDS denaturing gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blot analysis using an antibody against the T7 epitope (present in the amino terminus of suprabasin from the pET28 construct) showed that, after incubation with either TGase 2 or TGase 3, the monomeric suprabasin was cross-linked into a high molecular weight form (indicated by arrow in Fig. 7). Identification of the diverse precursors that contribute to CE formation will help us elucidate the complex series of steps that are required for the formation of a functional biological barrier in the stratified epithelia. This highly cross-linked insoluble structure that protects individuals is essential for well being, and disruptions of its formation have been correlated with skin diseases (5Presland R.B. Dale B.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2000; 11: 383-408Google Scholar). Recently, through the use of different approaches and methodologies such as subtractive hybridization, rapid analysis of gene expression, positional cloning, and EST data base searches (17Zhao X.P. Elder J.T. Genomics. 1997; 45: 250-258Google Scholar, 18Marenholz I. Zirra M. Fischer D.F. Backendorf C. Ziegler A. Mischke D. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 341-355Google Scholar, 19Marshall D. Hardman M.J.

Morohashi M. Huh N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47445-47452Google Scholar), several new epidermal-specific genes and CE precursors have been identified. In this report we present data on the identification and characterization of a novel gene with a potential role in epidermal stratification. The cDNA was initially identified by performing an SSH procedure. From the in situ hybridization data, we show that the suprabasin mRNA is restricted and highly expressed in the suprabasal layers of the neonatal epidermis. The suprabasin probe identifies transcripts of 2.2 and 0.7 kb in mouse RNA from stratified epithelial tissues and in extra-embryonic tissue (E7). The expression of the suprabasin transcripts in cultured keratinocytes was shown to be dependent on PKC signaling, because specific inhibition of PKC abolished the differentiation-induced expression. Alternatively, we also showed that the human suprabasin transcripts could be induced by treatment of NHEK cells with the PKC inducer, TPA. This response to TPA treatment has been shown for other epidermal late differentiation markers (33Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 217-225Google Scholar, 34Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 409-414Google Scholar), emphasizing the role of PKC in the Ca2+-mediated induction of suprabasin during differentiation. Chromosomal FISH localized the mouse suprabasin gene to chromosome 7, at band 7B2–7B3. Data base searches identified only one homolog gene in the human genomic data bases in chromosome 19q13.1, in a region that is syntenic to the region where the mouse suprabasin gene was localized. The 2.2-kb suprabasin transcript contains an open reading frame, which encodes a protein of 700 amino acids that is glycine-rich (∼20%) and has a high content of basic residues such as lysine, histidine, and arginine. The deduced suprabasin protein sequence shares structural features with other differentiation markers such as involucrin and loricrin, and somewhat with sciellin, although suprabasin lacks a LIM domain sequence (10Champliaud M.F. Burgeson R.E. Jin W. Baden H.P. Olson P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31547-31554Google Scholar). Based on structural features, suprabasin can be divided into three domains: an amino-terminal region that contains a potential transmembrane sequence, a central domain with tandem repeats, and a carboxyl domain. 56% of the repetitive region in suprabasin is composed of glycine, glutamine, histidine, and alanine residues. The glutamine residues may be serving as acceptors of glutamyl-lysyl isopeptide bonds mediated by transglutaminases. TGases are Ca2+-dependent enzymes that catalyze the formation of ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide cross-links and/or in the covalent incorporation of polyamines and histamine. These covalent cross-links often result in the oligomerization of substrate proteins. Our results show that the recombinant suprabasin protein is a substrate for both, tissue TGase 2 and the epidermal TGase 3. Although we demonstrated the oligomerization of suprabasin in vitro by TGases, we did not detect the presence of previously determined transglutaminase target sequences in suprabasin (6Robinson N.A. Lapic S. Welter J.F. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12035-12046Google Scholar, 7Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Google Scholar). It remains to be determined which are the specific residues that are reactive in suprabasin, whether these are also utilized in vivo, and whether the endogenous suprabasin is incorporated to the CE. The relevance of each of the domains in the full-length suprabasin was shown with the intracellular localization of the GFP/suprabasin full-length and truncated proteins in transfected keratinocytes. The full-length GFP/suprabasin showed a highly patched phenotype that did not co-localized with mitochondria or lysosomes. This patched phenotype was absent when the protein was truncated to include only the amino-terminal domain, which presented a homogenous cytoplasmic distribution. The patched expression was shown to be caused at least in part by the repeat region, because the GFP/suprabasin-(1–425) had also a patched phenotype, although with a more perinuclear restricted expression. In addition, the mouse smaller transcript (0.7 kb) contains an open reading frame that shares the amino-terminal domain with the full-length suprabasin protein, but lacks the repeat domain. It will be of great interest to determine the role of the spliced transcript in the overall process of epidermal differentiation. We thank Dr. E. Ralston and the members of the NIAMS Image Facility for help with the cell microscopy. We also thank Drs. P. Steinert, K. Boeshans, and B. Advazi for supplying active TGase 3.

https://openalex.org/W2152478355,"We have characterized a Kazal family serine protease inhibitor, Toxoplasma gondiiprotease inhibitor 1 (TgPI-1), in the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. TgPI-1 contains four inhibitor domains predicted to inhibit trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase. Antibodies against recombinant TgPI-1 detect two polypeptides, of 43 and 41 kDa, designated TgPI-143 and TgPI-141, in tachyzoites, bradyzoites, and sporozoites. TgPI-143 and TgPI-141 are secreted constitutively from dense granules into the excreted/secreted antigen fraction as well as the parasitophorous vacuole that T. gondii occupies during intracellular replication. Recombinant TgPI-1 inhibits trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatic elastase, and neutrophil elastase. Immunoprecipitation studies with anti-rTgPI-1 antibodies reveal that recombinant TgPI-1 forms a complex with trypsin that is dependent on interactions with the active site of the protease. TgPI-1 is the first anti-trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor to be identified in bradyzoites and sporozoites, stages of the parasite that would be exposed to proteolytic enzymes in the digestive tract of the host.

TgPI-1 is the first anti-trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor to be identified in bradyzoites and sporozoites, stages of the parasite that would be exposed to proteolytic enzymes in the digestive tract of the host. Toxoplasma gondii commonly infects humans and occasionally causes opportunistic disease. Recrudescence of a latent infection in immunodeficient individuals can result in encephalitis (1Luft B.J. Remington J.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 211-222Google Scholar). Transplacental transmission of T. gondii can cause spontaneous abortion, mental retardation, and blindness (2Carter A.O. Frank J.W. Can. Med. Assoc. J. 1986; 135: 618-623Google Scholar). T. gondii is primarily acquired through the ingestion of sporulated oocysts, containing sporozoites, shed by the definitive host (felids) or by ingestion of undercooked meat harboring bradyzoite tissue cysts. The cyst wall is digested during transit through the gastrointestinal tract, releasing the bradyzoites/sporozoites, which penetrate the intestinal epithelium where they immediately differentiate into rapidly dividing tachyzoites. Tachyzoites disseminate and proliferate during the acute stage of infection before differentiating into bradyzoites, which encyst in muscle tissue and the central nervous system thereby establishing a chronic infection (3Black M.W. Boothroyd J.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 607-623Google Scholar). Because T. gondii transits through the digestive tract and is resistant to physiological levels of trypsin (4Sharma S.P. Dubey J.P. Am. J. Vet. Res. 1981; 42: 128-130Google Scholar), it has been speculated that T. gondii secretes protease inhibitors that aid in protecting the parasite from the proteolytic enzymes, trypsin and chymotrypsin, found within the lower intestine.

(5Pszenny V. Angel S.O. Duschak V.G. Paulino M. Ledesma B. Yabo M.I. Guarnera E. Ruiz A.M. Bontempi E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 107: 241-249Google Scholar) was identified inT. gondii. We have independently identified the same protease inhibitor, termed TgPI-1. Until now, expression of protease inhibitor polypeptides has not been demonstrated in bradyzoites or sporozoites, stages of the parasite most likely to be exposed to the proteolytic environment of the digestive tract. As obligate intracellular parasites, host cell invasion and subsequent proliferation are essential to the lifecycle of T. gondii. During the lytic cycle of replication parasite attachment to the host cell is accompanied by the discharge of micronemes, small cigar-shaped vesicles located at the apical end of the parasite. Next, rhoptry (ROP) proteins are discharged and serve to aid in the establishment of the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), a protected compartment within the host cell in which the parasites reside. Once inside the host cell, the parasite releases proteins from dense granules (DGs) into the PV. Although ten DG proteins have been identified (6Cesbron-Delauw M.-F. Capron A. Res. Immunol. 1993; 144: 41-44Google Scholar, 7Silverman J.A. Joiner K.A. Kaufmann S.H.E. Host Response to Intracellular Pathogens. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1997: 315-339Google Scholar), the precise functions of DG proteins remain poorly understood. N-terminal sequencing of proteins found in excreted/secreted antigen (ESA) fractions reveal the presence of TgPI-1, a protein belonging to the Kazal family of serine protease inhibitors. This family of protease inhibitors is defined by a set of conserved disulfide bonds that form a rigid structure exposing the reactive site P1 residue for interaction with its target protease (8Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 9Laskowski Jr., M. Qasin M.A. Lu S.M. Hanes B.D. Glover D.M. Protein-Protein Recognition.

TgPI-1 contains four inhibitor domains, which are predicted to inhibit chymotrypsin, trypsin, and elastase. Serine protease inhibitors are classified according to structure and mechanism of inhibition (8Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 9Laskowski Jr., M. Qasin M.A. Lu S.M. Hanes B.D. Glover D.M. Protein-Protein Recognition.

The SERPIN, Kunitz, and Kazal families represent some of the most widely studied families of serine protease inhibitors, some of which function in viral or parasite pathogenesis. For example, several SERPINS identified from poxvirus have been shown to inhibit inflammation and apoptosis and function in determination of viral host range (11Turner P.C. ASM News. 2001; 67: 201-209Google Scholar). A Kunitz family serine protease inhibitor isolated from the hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicaum has activity against chymotrypsin, pancreatic elastase, neutrophil elastase, and trypsin and may contribute to the ability of the parasite to evade the immune system and provide protection during its residence within the small intestine (12Milstone A.M. Harrison L.M. Bungiro R.D. Kuzmic P. Cappello M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29391-29399Google Scholar). Kazal inhibitors have been found in mammals (pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitors, mammalian seminal acrosin inhibitors) (13Kazal L. Spicer D. Braninsky R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1948; 70: 3034-3040Google Scholar), birds (avian ovomucoids, chicken ovoinhibitor) (8Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Scopus (1917) Google Scholar), leeches (leech-derived tryptase inhibitor) (14Stubbs M.T. Morenweiser R. Sturzebecher J. Bauer M. Bode W. Huber R. Piechottka G.P. Matschiner G. Sommerhoff C.P. Fritz H. Auerswald E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19931-19937Google Scholar), and insects (rhodniin) (15van de Locht A. Lamba D. Bauer M. Huber R. Friedrich T. Kroger B. Hoffken W. Bode W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5149-5157Google Scholar) and used extensively in vitro to study the interactions of serine proteases with their substrates. However, little work has been published on the function of Kazal inhibitors in vivo. Here we show that TgPI-1 protein is expressed in T. gondiitachyzoites, bradyzoites, and sporozoites and is secreted from DGs. Recombinant TgPI-1 (rTgPI-1) inhibits trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatic elastase, and neutrophil elastase. The ability of TgPI-1 to target a broad range of proteases, along with its expression and secretion profile, suggests that it may play a critical function in the lifecycle of T. gondii. Trypsin (bovine pancreas), α-chymotrypsin (bovine pancreas), elastase (porcine pancreas), glutamine, and a ProteoMass peptide calibration kit were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Human neutrophil elastase was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Lys-pNA, and Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA were from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). PCR minispin columns, pQE30, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, and pREP4(M15) cells were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). BCA protein quantitation reagent and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate were from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Oregon green-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Lewes, UK). TaqDNA polymerase and sequencing grade trypsin were from Promega (Madison, WI). Centricon C-20 and C-10 concentrators were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). All electrophoretic equipment and reagents for two-dimensional electrophoresis were from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). All other reagents were from Fisher. T. gondii strain RH and 2F tachyzoites were serially passagedin vitro in human foreskin fibroblasts grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Parasites were purified by membrane filtration as described previously (16Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Google Scholar). Bradyzoites and sporozoites were purified as described previously (17Cornelissen A.W. Overdulve J.P. Hoenderboom J.M. Parasitology. 1981; 83: 103-108Google Scholar, 18Speer C.A. Tilley M. Temple M.E. Blixt J.A. Dubey J.P. White M.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 75-86Google Scholar). Total RNA isolated from encysted bradyzoites and tachyzoites was digested with DNase, and the absence of DNA was checked by PCR before reverse transcription as described (19Dzierszinski F. Popescu O. Toursel C. Slomianny C. Yahiaoui B. Tomavo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24888-24895Google Scholar). One microgram of purified total RNA was reverse-transcribed for 1 h at 42 °C in a buffer containing 1m oligo(dT)18 primer, 2 mm dNTP, and 25 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction mixture was heat inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min. PCR amplifications were performed using 5 units ofTaqDNA polymerase in 100-μl reaction volumes containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTP, and 100 pm of each primer. Thermal cycling conditions were: 1) denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min; 2) annealing at 50–60 °C (depending on each primer pair); 3) elongation at 72 °C for 2 min; 4) at the end, an additional extension was done at 72 °C for 10 min. The primer pair for TgPI-1 was as follows: FTgPI-1.69 (GTGTTTGCTTCGCCCGAAACG) and RTgPI-1.369 (GTTGAGTCGCAATTCGCGAGT). Large-scale preparation of ESA proteins was performed by incubating 5 × 109 2F strain tachyzoites in 15 ml of DMEM containing 2 mmglutamine, 10 mm HEPES, and 1% ethanol at 37 °C for 20 min followed by cooling on ice 5 min. Parasites were removed by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was concentrated to 400 μl using C-20 concentrators according to the manufacturer's instructions. ESA proteins were separated in the first dimension using the PROTEAN isoelectric focusing system employing pH gradient strips. 150 μg of ESA protein was mixed with rehydration buffer containing 8 m urea, 4% CHAPS, 0.2% carrier ampholytes, and 2 mm tri-butyl phosphine. Rehydration and isoelectric focusing were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using an 11-cm ReadyStripTM (pH 4–7). Following focusing, proteins were reduced and carboxymethylated by successive 10-min treatments with equilibration buffer containing 2% dithiothreitol followed by 2.5% iodoacetamide. Proteins were resolved in the second dimension on a 10–20% linear gradient SDS-PAGE gel and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (20Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Google Scholar). The protein spot corresponding to TgPI-1 (preliminarily identified by Western blotting) was excised, digested in-gel with sequencing grade trypsin, and solvent-extracted as described previously (21Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar). Extracted peptides were dried down and redissolved in 2 μl of 50% acetonitrile and 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid, mixed with matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroycinnamic acid), and deposited on the mass spectrometry (MS) target plate according to a general two-layer method (22Onnerfjord P. Ekstrom S. Bergquist J. Nilsson J. Laurell T. Marko-Varga G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 315-322Google Scholar). MS was performed on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystem Voyager DE-STR). The spectra of peptide mass fingerprints were acquired in the positive reflection mode with delayed extraction. The spectra were calibrated by external standard sample (ProteoMass peptide calibration kit) deposited on the MS plate adjacent to the Tg-PI-1 spot. Peptide mass fingerprinting data from MALDI-TOF were used to search against NCBI data base via the MS-Fit algorithm (prospector.ucsf.edu). The search resulted in a match to TgPI-1 (nine matching peptides at mass tolerance of 50 ppm, Mowse score 9.15 × 105, 22% sequence coverage). Secretion analyses were performed essentially as described previously (23Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 109 tachyzoites were resuspended in invasion media (DMEM, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 3% fetal bovine serum) and incubated for 2 min at 37 °C with 100 μm BAPTA-AM or invasion media alone before being transferred to an ice water bath. Parasites were removed by centrifugation (twice at 1000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C), and culture supernatants were concentrated 20-fold in C-10 concentrators, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. Immunofluorescence of intracellular parasites was performed essentially as described previously (24Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 114-123Google Scholar). Briefly, intracellular parasites were allowed to invade monolayers of HFF for various time intervals, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 0.027% glutaraldehyde, PBS for 20 min at 25 °C, and fully permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS. TgPI-1 was detected using rabbit polyclonal sera (RαrTgPI-1) diluted 1:500. GRA4 and GRA1 were detected with Tg17–43 and 4G1.AH11, respectively, diluted 1:500. Oregon green-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were used at 1:500 for detection. Extracellular parasites were purified as described above, fixed in 3% formaldehyde, 0.027% glutaraldehyde for 30 min, 4 °C, washed twice with 10 ml of PBS, 4 °C, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Fixed parasites were added to eight-well chamber slides precoated with poly-l-lysine (0.01% final), incubated at 25 °C for 25 min, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS for 15 min at 25 °C. Antibody staining was done exactly as described for intracellular parasites. Membranous fractions were isolated from vacuoles as described previously (25Labruyere E. Lingnau M. Mercier C. Sibley L.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 311-324Google Scholar). Briefly, tachyzoites were inoculated onto HFF monolayers and incubated 16 h. Monolayers were washed twice with PBS to remove extracellular tachyzoites, and vacuoles were lysed by passage through 23- and 25-gauge syringes. Liberated tachyzoites were removed by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 10 min at 25 °C. The low speed supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g 2 h at 4 °C to separate membranous fractions (pellet) and soluble components (supernatant). Equivalent amounts of pellet and supernatant were analyzed by Western blotting. The following primers were used to amplify TgPI-1 from a cDNA library: FTgPI-1.66 (GACTGGATCCGCTTCGCCCGAAACGAAAG) and RTgPI-1.882 (GACTGGTACCTTGGTCATCCCAGATCTC). PCR products were gel-purified using Qiagen spin columns, ligated into pQE30 vector digested withKpnI-BamHI, and transformed into pREP4(M15) cells. Positive transformants were confirmed by sequencing both strands of the insert. Bacteria harboring TgPI-1 in pQE30 were induced by addition of 1m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were pelleted, subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles, resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole), and sonicated 10 times for 15 s (Misonix XL). Lysed cells were centrifuged for 30 min, 10,000 ×g at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The column was washed with 10 volumes of wash buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole) and eluted into four 0.5-ml fractions with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole). For activity assays, rTgPI-1 was dialyzed against PBS to exchange buffers. Proteases were incubated with increasing concentrations of inhibitor in a volume of 5 μl and incubated at 4 °C (trypsin, 0.59 pmol; human neutrophil elastase, 20 pmol) or 25 °C (pancreatic elastase, 11.58 pmol; chymotrypsin, 0.56 pmol) for 15 min before addition of 175 μl of assay buffer (chymotrypsin assay buffer: 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mmCaCl2, 1 mm Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA; trypsin assay buffer: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, containing 0.1m NaCl, 0.05% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.4 mmSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Lys-pNA, pancreatic elastase assay buffer; 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA; human neutrophil elastase buffer: 0.2 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mmSuc-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA). Experiments were performed at least twice, in triplicate, and reaction velocities were linear over the course of the reaction. Initial velocities were measured by monitoring absorbance at 405 nm on a V maxTMMolecular Devices kinetic microplate reader. K iapp were determined graphically by plotting [V o/V i] − 1 versus [I], where V ois the velocity in the absence of inhibitor, V iis the reaction velocity in the presence of inhibitor and [I] is inhibitor concentration. K iapp were converted toK i according to the following formula:K i = K iapp/[1 + [s]/K m]. Varying concentrations of substrate were incubated with a fixed amount of protease under the conditions described above, and initial velocities were measured by monitoring absorbance at 405 nm. Double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burke plots of 1/[v] versus 1/[s] were used to determine K m of each substrate for its partner protease. Protease-inhibitor complexes were prepared by incubation of purified trypsin (400 ng) with ∼1.5-fold molar excess of rTgP1–1 (400 ng) in PBS for 30 min at 25 °C in a final volume of 10 μl. Complexes were immunoprecipitated by addition of 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1 mTris, 1% Triton X-100, 5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) and incubation with 2.5 μl of mouse anti-rTgPI-1 antisera for 16 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Protein G-Sepharose beads (2.5% final v/v) were added and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. Beads were washed four times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, aspirated, and resuspended in 100 μl of SB (0.2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 32 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.02 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol). SDS-PAGE was performed on 12.5% minigels (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for 40 min at 16 V using a Transblot SD semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Western blots were developed by chemiluminescence as described previously (26Wan K.L. Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Ajioka J.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 203-214Google Scholar). Previously, putative secretory proteins were identified utilizing sub-cellular fractionation techniques and isolation of excreted/secreted antigens (ESA) in parasite culture supernatants (27Brydges S.D. Sherman G.D. Nockemann S. Loyens A. Daubener W. Dubremetz J.F. Carruthers V.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 51-66Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of putative secretory proteins revealed the presence of T.g ondii proteaseinhibitor 1 (TgPI-1) in ESA. BLAST analysis of the T. gondii expressed sequence tag (EST) database with the TgPI-1 nucleotide sequence reveals that the TgPI-1 sequence was present in the database with 13 tachyzoite ESTs and no bradyzoite ESTs. The TgPI-1 gene is predicted to encode a 30-kDa protein containing four protease inhibitor domains and an N-terminal signal sequence (Fig.1 A). TgPI-1 is predicted to be a serine protease inhibitor belonging to the Kazal family whose members characteristically have multiple protease specificity domains (8Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 9Laskowski Jr., M. Qasin M.A. Lu S.M. Hanes B.D. Glover D.M. Protein-Protein Recognition. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 228-279Google Scholar, 10Roberts R.M. Mathialagan N. Duffy J.Y. Smith G.W. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene. Expr. 1995; 5: 385-436Google Scholar). This family of protease inhibitors is defined by a set of conserved disulfide bonds that form a rigid structure exposing the reactive site P1 residue for interaction with its target protease (Fig.1 A). Alignment of the inhibitor domains of TgPI-1 with other Kazal inhibitor domains reveals a highly conserved placement of cysteine residues predicted to form the disulfide bonds important to the three-dimensional structure of each domain (Fig. 1 B). Kazal inhibitors act as pseudosubstrates, binding tightly to their target proteases (8Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 9Laskowski Jr., M. Qasin M.A. Lu S.M. Hanes B.D. Glover D.M. Protein-Protein Recognition. Oxford University Press, New York2000: 228-279Google Scholar, 10Roberts R.M. Mathialagan N. Duffy J.Y. Smith G.W. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene. Expr. 1995; 5: 385-436Google Scholar). RT-PCR was used to assess whether mRNA for TgPI-1 was present in tachyzoites, the rapidly dividing form of the parasite, and bradyzoites, the slow growing form of the parasite. RNA was purified from tachyzoites and bradyzoites and used in RT-PCR with TgPI-1-specific primers. With both tachyzoite and bradyzoite mRNA, RT-PCR with TgPI-1-specific primers yielded the expected product of 300 bp (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3 and 4). As a control, the housekeeping gene T. gondii superoxide dismutase was included (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that mRNA for TgPI-1 is present in both tachyzoites and bradyzoites. Antibodies were raised against recombinant TgPI-1 (rTgPI-1). Rabbit antibodies generated against rTgPI-1 (RαrTgPI-1) recognize two polypeptides in extracellular tachyzoites, bradyzoites, and sporozoites, TgPI-143 and TgPI-141, named according to their apparent molecular weight as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–5). TgPI-1 possesses a hydrophobic N-terminal sequence that has the properties of a signal sequence, suggesting that it might be a secretory protein. In an effort to determine whether TgPI-1 was secreted, two-dimensional gels of T. gondii ESA were transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with RαrTgPI-1 (Fig.3 A). The polypeptide recognized by RαrTgPI-1 was excised from a sister gel stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue (Fig. 3 B), digested with trypsin, and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). The resulting peptide mass fingerprint was used to search the NCBI database and confirm the identity of TgPI-1. These results suggest that TgPI-1 is secreted byT. gondii. ESA fractions consist predominately of secreted micronemal and DG proteins. Calcium chelators such as BAPTA-AM specifically block microneme secretion without markedly affecting DG secretion (16Carruthers V.B. Sibley L.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 421-428Google Scholar). To determine if TgPI-143 and TgPI-141 are of micronemal or DG origin, ESA fractions obtained from untreated and BAPTA-AM treated parasites were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with RαrTgPI-1. As a control, release of the micronemal protein, TgMIC2 (115 kDa), which is proteolytically processed to sTgMIC2 (95 kDa) coincident with its release into ESA (23Carruthers V.B. Sherman G.D. Sibley L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14346-14353Google Scholar), was assessed. Secretion of sTgMIC2 into ESA is completely blocked when parasites are pretreated with BAPTA-AM (Fig. 3 C, lane 4). In contrast to TgMIC2, the DG protein, GRA1, is present in extracellular tachyzoites (Fig. 3 D, lane 1), as well as ESA from untreated and BAPTA-AM-treated parasites (Fig. 3 D, lanes 3and 4), indicating the constitutive nature of its secretion. Like GRA1, TgPI-143 and TgPI-141 are present in the ESA of untreated as well as BAPTA-AM- treated parasites (Fig. 3 E, lanes 1, 3, and4). These results are consistent with TgPI-143and TgPI-141 being secreted into ESA via DGs. Dual label indirect immunofluorescence of extracellular tachyzoites was used to confirm the DG localization of TgPI-1. RαrTgPI-1 exhibited punctate staining throughout the parasite (Fig.4 A), and this staining pattern perfectly overlaps with the distribution of the DG protein, GRA1 (as detected with mAb Tg17–43). Punctate granular staining was also observed with single labeling for TgPI-1 and GRA1 (data not shown). These results confirm the DG localization of TgPI-1 in extracellular tachyzoites. After T. gondii has invaded host cells, DG proteins discharge from lateral sites near the apical end of the parasite, diffuse and surround the parasites, and eventually disperse throughout the PV. To date, ten DG proteins (GRA1 through GRA8 and two isoforms of NTPase) have been identified. It has been speculated that DG proteins play a role in the maintenance and remodeling of the PV as well as nutrient acquisition (28Lingelbach K. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1467-1475Google Scholar). Dual label immunofluorescence of timed invasions was used to assess the kinetics of TgPI-1 secretion into the PV. Freshly isolated tachyzoites were inoculated onto a monolayer of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) for 1 min and incubated for varying intervals of time before they were fixed, permeabilized, and probed with RαrTgPI-1 and a mouse mAb against GRA1 (mAbTg17–43) or GRA4 (WU# 950). Ten minutes post-invasion, RαrTgPI-1 and mAb Tg17–43 exhibited intense staining on either side of the apical end of the parasites (Fig. 4 B) in 45% (45/101) of the PVs observed. At 60 min post-invasion, TgPI-1 and GRA1 are redistributed, completely surrounding the parasite residing within the PV (Fig. 4 C) in 82% (125/152) of PVs, and by 24 h post-invasion, TgPI-1 and GRA4 completely filled the PV (Fig. 4 D) in virtually all PVs (not quantified). Similar patterns were also observed in single-labeling experiments using RαrTgPI-1, mAb Tg17–43, or WU# 950 (data not shown). These results indicate that the kinetics of TgPI-1 secretion into the PV follows the timing of DG discharge. After secretion into the PV, DG proteins can be targeted to the PV membrane (29Lecordier L. Mercier C. Torpier G. Tourvieille B. Darcy F. Liu J.L. Maes P. Tartar A. Capron A. Cesbron-Delauw M.F. Mol.

The solubility characteristics of a DG protein are important for predicting whether the protein will remain confined to the host cell after parasite egress or whether it will be released to potentially act in the extracellular environment of the tissues surrounding the site of infection. Differential centrifugation was used to determine the intravacuolar localization of TgPI-143 and TgPI-141. HFF monolayers were infected with tachyzoites for 24 h and washed"

The understanding of Polμ function should be facilitated by an understanding of its biochemical activities. By using purified human Polμ for biochemical analyses, we discovered the lesion bypass activities of this polymerase in response to several types of DNA damage. When it encountered a template 8-oxoguanine, abasic site, or 1,N 6-ethenoadenine, purified human Polμ efficiently bypassed the lesion. Even bulky DNA adducts such asN-2-acetylaminofluorene-adducted guanine, (+)- and (−)-trans-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-N 2-dG were unable to block the polymerase activity of human Polμ. Bypass of these simple base damage and bulky adducts was predominantly achieved by human Polμ through a deletion mechanism. The Polμ specificity of nucleotide incorporation indicates that the deletion resulted from primer realignment before translesion synthesis. Purified human Polμ also effectively bypassed a template cis-synTT dimer. However, this bypass was achieved in a mainly error-free manner with AA incorporation opposite the TT dimer. These results provide new insights into the biochemistry of human Polμ and show that efficient translesion synthesis activity is not strictly confined to the Y family polymerases.

Lesion bypass can be error-free as a result of insertion of the correct nucleotide opposite the lesion or error-prone as the result of insertion of an incorrect nucleotide opposite the lesion. Both error-free and error-prone nucleotide insertions have been observed with the Y family polymerases depending on the specific lesion and the specific polymerase (reviewed in Refs. 10Wang Z. Mutat.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25639-25642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Biochemical studies of purified human Polμ have uncovered a unique property that has never been observed with any other polymerases studied so far (23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Human Polμ is highly prone to frameshift DNA synthesis (23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). At single-nucleotide repeat sequences, DNA synthesis by human Polμ is mediated mainly by a deletion mechanism because of primer-template realignment before synthesis (23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the primer 3′ end contains one or a few mismatches, human Polμ can promote primer-template realignment such that the primer 3′ end can find its complementary sequences on the template several nucleotides downstream, achieving microhomology search and microhomology pairing (23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These striking biochemical properties led Zhang et al.(23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to propose that Polμ may be involved in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) for double-strand DNA repair. The biochemical properties of human Polμ ruled out a significant role for this polymerase in somatic hypermutation during immunoglobulin development.One important cause of DNA double-strand breaks is DNA damage. It is conceivable that some damaged sites may contain clustered lesions or that base damage may be contained near some double-strand DNA breaks. Under those circumstances, Polμ would encounter DNA base damage while performing microhomology search and pairing, as well as DNA synthesis, during NHEJ. Hence, we asked whether Polμ is capable of translesion synthesis. In this report, we demonstrate that human Polμ indeed possesses efficient lesion bypass activities in response to very different types of DNA damage, ranging from simple base modifications and baseless sites to bulky chemical DNA adducts andcis-syn TT dimer of UV radiation. Although in vitro bypass of a template TT dimer is achieved by human Polμ in an error-free manner, bypass of the other tested lesions is mediated by a deletion mechanism that effectively avoids copying the damaged template base through primer realignment. These findings provide new insights into the biochemistry of human Polμ and show that efficient translesion synthesis activity is not strictly confined to Y family polymerases.DISCUSSIONPreviously, we proposed that Polμ may be involved in NHEJ of double-strand DNA breaks through its microhomology searching and pairing activities (23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Most recently, Mahajan et al. (33Mahajan K.N. Nick McElhinny S.A. Mitchell B.S. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5194-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) reported that cellular levels of human Polμ protein are increased by ionizing radiation, and that Polμ is associated with the NHEJ proteins Ku and XRCC4-ligase IV, further supporting a role of this polymerase in NHEJ. In this study, we found that human Polμ possesses DNA lesion bypass activities in response to various types of DNA damage. Thus, efficient translesion synthesis activity is not strictly limited to the Y family of DNA polymerases. Under similar experimental conditions, we did not detect any lesion bypass activities of purified human Polβ (Fig. 7), except for 8-oxoguanine (34Zhang Y. Yuan F., Wu, X. Taylor J.-S. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 928-935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is a miscoding rather than a strong blocking lesion (35Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). Because Polμ and Polβ share sequence homologies and they both belong to the X family of DNA polymerases (1Dominguez O. Ruiz J.F. Lain de Lera T. Garcia-Diaz M. Gonzalez M.A. Kirchhoff T. Martinez A.C. Bernad A. Blanco L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Aoufouchi S. Flatter E. Dahan A. Faili A. Bertocci B. Storck S. Delbos F. Cocea L. Gupta N. Weill J.C. Reynaud C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3684-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the lesion bypass activity of human Polμ appears to be unique among X family members.In response to the template AP site 8-oxoguanine, 1,N 6-ethenoadenine, AAF-adducted guanine, and (+)- and (−)-trans-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-N 2-dG, human Polμ bypasses the lesion predominantly by a deletion mechanism. The specificity of nucleotide incorporation during translesion synthesis indicates that deletion is a result of primer realignment. Because these DNA lesions differ dramatically in structure, we propose that bypass of these lesions by human Polμ may be achieved by looping out the template lesion, thus avoiding a direct copying of the damaged template base. The exact deletion size appears to depend on the sequence context of the lesion. For example, if the primer 3′ end can pair with a template base 5′ to the lesion, such realignment would be preferred by human Polμ. Thus, when human Polμ encounters a lesion, if the coding capacity of the modified base is lost or significantly altered, Polμ simply realigns the primer-template strands to continue DNA synthesis by skipping the lesion. Most recently, it was reported that human cell extracts supplemented with purified human Polμ are able to extend a primer from opposite an AAF-adducted guanine by adding a ladder of as many as 15 guanines in an apparently nontemplated reaction (36Duvauchelle J.-B. Blance L. Fuchs R.P.P. Cordonnier A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2061-2067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activity is different from the lesion bypass activity of human Polμ reported here, and its functional significance remains unknown.On the basis of mutation spectra of several DNA lesions, base substitutions rather than deletions appear to be the major mutational events in mammalian cells (37Moriya M. Spiegel S. Fernandes A. Amin S. Liu T. Geacintov N. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16646-16651Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 38Gentil A. Cabral-Neto J.B. Mariage-Samson R.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4098-4104PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the prevailing deletion mechanism of lesion bypass by human Polμ suggests that this polymerase is unlikely to play a major role in translesion synthesis during replication in normal cells and under normal growth conditions. It is now clear that single nucleotide repeats, mismatched primer 3′ ends, and many DNA lesions greatly promote the primer-template realignment by human Polμ. These biochemical properties support the role of Polμ in NHEJ. Furthermore, the lesion bypass activities of Polμ would make it possible for this polymerase to perform microhomology search, microhomology pairing, and DNA synthesis during NHEJ even in the presence of base lesions. After NHEJ is complete, the base lesion can then be removed by an excision repair mechanism.Remarkably, the effective bypass of a cis-syn TT dimer by human Polμ is error-free. Because no template TT sequence is present anywhere 5′ to the lesion or near the lesion on the 3′ side (Fig. 6), AA insertion during the bypass must result from the direct copying of the TT dimer by human Polμ. A template TT (6-4) photoproduct, however, completely blocks human Polμ. It is possible that because of covalent linkage between the two thymine bases, the TT dimer and the TT (6-4) photoproduct may not be flexible enough to allow loop-out by human Polμ. Unlike the TT dimer, the TT (6-4) photoproduct may be too distorting to DNA structure to allow Polμ nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion. The only other eukaryotic DNA polymerase known to perform error-free bypass of a TT dimer is Polη (22Masutani C. Araki M. Yamada A. Kusumoto R. Nogimori T. Maekawa T. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 41Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Human xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells that lack Polη activity are sensitive to and hypermutable by UV radiation (19–21,42); thus they establish an important in vivo role for this polymerase in error-free bypass of UV lesions. However, it is not known how Polη would respond to other cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers such as the C-containing dimers. Therefore, it is unknown to what extent loss of the TT dimer bypass by Polη contributes to UV-induced sensitivity and mutagenesis in xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells. With this uncertainty, we are unable to assess at the present time the in vivo importance of the error-free TT dimer bypass by Polμ. Nevertheless, our results raised the possibility that Polμ may participate in the error-free bypass of TT dimers in cells, especially when the Polη function is compromised, as in the case of the xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells.

Additional members in this family include Polβ, Polλ, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (1Dominguez O. Ruiz J.F. Lain de Lera T. Garcia-Diaz M. Gonzalez M.A. Kirchhoff T. Martinez A.C.

During base excision repair in higher eukaryotes, Polβ is a major repair synthesis polymerase (4Kubota Y. Nash R.A. Klungland A. Schar P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T.

Cellular functions of Polλ and Polμ have not been clearly defined. Although the biochemical activities of the X family DNA polymerases appear to be quite diverse, all of the Y family DNA polymerases share a common biochemical activity: synthesis opposite DNA lesions (reviewed in Refs. 10Wang Z.

Thus, it is generally believed that a major function of the Y family DNA polymerases is to copy damaged sites of DNA during replication, a cellular process referred to as lesion bypass or translesion synthesis.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) are indeed involved in lesion bypass in cells. Lesion bypass can be error-free as a result of insertion of the correct nucleotide opposite the lesion or error-prone as the result of insertion of an incorrect nucleotide opposite the lesion. Both error-free and error-prone nucleotide insertions have been observed with the Y family polymerases depending on the specific lesion and the specific polymerase (reviewed in Refs. 10Wang Z. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Wang Z. Mol. Interv. 2001; 1: 269-281PubMed Google Scholar, 12Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25639-25642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of purified human Polμ have uncovered a unique property that has never been observed with any other polymerases studied so far (23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Human Polμ is highly prone to frameshift DNA synthesis (23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). At single-nucleotide repeat sequences, DNA synthesis by human Polμ is mediated mainly by a deletion mechanism because of primer-template realignment before synthesis (23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the primer 3′ end contains one or a few mismatches, human Polμ can promote primer-template realignment such that the primer 3′ end can find its complementary sequences on the template several nucleotides downstream, achieving microhomology search and microhomology pairing (23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These striking biochemical properties led Zhang et al.(23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to propose that Polμ may be involved in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) for double-strand DNA repair. The biochemical properties of human Polμ ruled out a significant role for this polymerase in somatic hypermutation during immunoglobulin development. One important cause of DNA double-strand breaks is DNA damage. It is conceivable that some damaged sites may contain clustered lesions or that base damage may be contained near some double-strand DNA breaks. Under those circumstances, Polμ would encounter DNA base damage while performing microhomology search and pairing, as well as DNA synthesis, during NHEJ. Hence, we asked whether Polμ is capable of translesion synthesis. In this report, we demonstrate that human Polμ indeed possesses efficient lesion bypass activities in response to very different types of DNA damage, ranging from simple base modifications and baseless sites to bulky chemical DNA adducts andcis-syn TT dimer of UV radiation. Although in vitro bypass of a template TT dimer is achieved by human Polμ in an error-free manner, bypass of the other tested lesions is mediated by a deletion mechanism that effectively avoids copying the damaged template base through primer realignment. These findings provide new insights into the biochemistry of human Polμ and show that efficient translesion synthesis activity is not strictly confined to Y family polymerases. DISCUSSIONPreviously, we proposed that Polμ may be involved in NHEJ of double-strand DNA breaks through its microhomology searching and pairing activities (23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7995-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Most recently, Mahajan et al. (33Mahajan K.N. Nick McElhinny S.A. Mitchell B.S. Ramsden D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5194-5202Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) reported that cellular levels of human Polμ protein are increased by ionizing radiation, and that Polμ is associated with the NHEJ proteins Ku and XRCC4-ligase IV, further supporting a role of this polymerase in NHEJ. In this study, we found that human Polμ possesses DNA lesion bypass activities in response to various types of DNA damage. Thus, efficient translesion synthesis activity is not strictly limited to the Y family of DNA polymerases. Under similar experimental conditions, we did not detect any lesion bypass activities of purified human Polβ (Fig. 7), except for 8-oxoguanine (34Zhang Y. Yuan F., Wu, X. Taylor J.-S. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 928-935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is a miscoding rather than a strong blocking lesion (35Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). Because Polμ and Polβ share sequence homologies and they both belong to the X family of DNA polymerases (1Dominguez O. Ruiz J.F. Lain de Lera T. Garcia-Diaz M. Gonzalez M.A. Kirchhoff T. Martinez A.C. Bernad A. Blanco L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1731-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Aoufouchi S. Flatter E. Dahan A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3684-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the lesion bypass activity of human Polμ appears to be unique among X family members.In response to the template AP site 8-oxoguanine, 1,N 6-ethenoadenine, AAF-adducted guanine, and (+)- and (−)-trans-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-N 2-dG, human Polμ bypasses the lesion predominantly by a deletion mechanism. The specificity of nucleotide incorporation during translesion synthesis indicates that deletion is a result of primer realignment. Because these DNA lesions differ dramatically in structure, we propose that bypass of these lesions by human Polμ may be achieved by looping out the template lesion, thus avoiding a direct copying of the damaged template base. The exact deletion size appears to depend on the sequence context of the lesion. For example, if the primer 3′ end can pair with a template base 5′ to the lesion, such realignment would be preferred by human Polμ. Thus, when human Polμ encounters a lesion, if the coding capacity of the modified base is lost or significantly altered, Polμ simply realigns the primer-template strands to continue DNA synthesis by skipping the lesion. Most recently, it was reported that human cell extracts supplemented with purified human Polμ are able to extend a primer from opposite an AAF-adducted guanine by adding a ladder of as many as 15 guanines in an apparently nontemplated reaction (36Duvauchelle J.-B. Blance L. Fuchs R.P.P. Cordonnier A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2061-2067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This activity is different from the lesion bypass activity of human Polμ reported here, and its functional significance remains unknown.On the basis of mutation spectra of several DNA lesions, base substitutions rather than deletions appear to be the major mutational events in mammalian cells (37Moriya M. Spiegel S. Fernandes A. Amin S. Liu T. Geacintov N. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16646-16651Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 38Gentil A. Cabral-Neto J.B. Mariage-Samson R.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4098-4104PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the prevailing deletion mechanism of lesion bypass by human Polμ suggests that this polymerase is unlikely to play a major role in translesion synthesis during replication in normal cells and under normal growth conditions. It is now clear that single nucleotide repeats, mismatched primer 3′ ends, and many DNA lesions greatly promote the primer-template realignment by human Polμ. These biochemical properties support the role of Polμ in NHEJ. Furthermore, the lesion bypass activities of Polμ would make it possible for this polymerase to perform microhomology search, microhomology pairing, and DNA synthesis during NHEJ even in the presence of base lesions. After NHEJ is complete, the base lesion can then be removed by an excision repair mechanism.Remarkably, the effective bypass of a cis-syn TT dimer by human Polμ is error-free. Because no template TT sequence is present anywhere 5′ to the lesion or near the lesion on the 3′ side (Fig. 6), AA insertion during the bypass must result from the direct copying of the TT dimer by human Polμ. A template TT (6-4) photoproduct, however, completely blocks human Polμ. It is possible that because of covalent linkage between the two thymine bases, the TT dimer and the TT (6-4) photoproduct may not be flexible enough to allow loop-out by human Polμ. Unlike the TT dimer, the TT (6-4) photoproduct may be too distorting to DNA structure to allow Polμ nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion. The only other eukaryotic DNA polymerase known to perform error-free bypass of a TT dimer is Polη (22Masutani C. Araki M. Yamada A. Kusumoto R. Nogimori T. Maekawa T. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 41Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Human xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells that lack Polη activity are sensitive to and hypermutable by UV radiation (19–21,42); thus they establish an important in vivo role for this polymerase in error-free bypass of UV lesions. However, it is not known how Polη would respond to other cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers such as the C-containing dimers. Therefore, it is unknown to what extent loss of the TT dimer bypass by Polη contributes to UV-induced sensitivity and mutagenesis in xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells. With this uncertainty, we are unable to assess at the present time the in vivo importance of the error-free TT dimer bypass by Polμ. Nevertheless, our results raised the possibility that Polμ may participate in the error-free bypass of TT dimers in cells, especially when the Polη function is compromised, as in the case of the xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells. Previously, we proposed that Polμ may be involved in NHEJ of double-strand DNA breaks through its microhomology searching and pairing activities (23Zhang Y., Wu, X. Yuan F. Xie Z. Wang Z. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, the prevailing deletion mechanism of lesion bypass by human Polμ suggests that this polymerase is unlikely to play a major role in translesion synthesis during replication in normal cells and under normal growth conditions. It is now clear that single nucleotide repeats, mismatched primer 3′ ends, and many DNA lesions greatly promote the primer-template realignment by human Polμ. These biochemical properties support the role of Polμ in NHEJ. Furthermore, the lesion bypass activities of Polμ would make it possible for this polymerase to perform microhomology search, microhomology pairing, and DNA synthesis during NHEJ even in the presence of base lesions. After NHEJ is complete, the base lesion can then be removed by an excision repair mechanism. Remarkably, the effective bypass of a cis-syn TT dimer by human Polμ is error-free. Because no template TT sequence is present anywhere 5′ to the lesion or near the lesion on the 3′ side (Fig. 6), AA insertion during the bypass must result from the direct copying of the TT dimer by human Polμ. A template TT (6-4) photoproduct, however, completely blocks human Polμ. It is possible that because of covalent linkage between the two thymine bases, the TT dimer and the TT (6-4) photoproduct may not be flexible enough to allow loop-out by human Polμ. Unlike the TT dimer, the TT (6-4) photoproduct may be too distorting to DNA structure to allow Polμ nucleotide insertion opposite the lesion. The only other eukaryotic DNA polymerase known to perform error-free bypass of a TT dimer is Polη (22Masutani C. Araki M. Yamada A. Kusumoto R. Nogimori T. Maekawa T. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 41Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Human xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells that lack Polη activity are sensitive to and hypermutable by UV radiation (19–21,42); thus they establish an important in vivo role for this polymerase in error-free bypass of UV lesions. However, it is not known how Polη would respond to other cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers such as the C-containing dimers. Therefore, it is unknown to what extent loss of the TT dimer bypass by Polη contributes to UV-induced sensitivity and mutagenesis in xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells. With this uncertainty, we are unable to assess at the present time the in vivo importance of the error-free TT dimer bypass by Polμ. Nevertheless, our results raised the possibility that Polμ may participate in the error-free bypass of TT dimers in cells, especially when the Polη function is compromised, as in the case of the xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2134281919,"Gastric adenocarcinoma is one of the major malignancies worldwide. Gastric cell lines have been widely used as the model to study the genetics, pharmacology and biochemistry of gastric cancers. Here we describe a comprehensive survey of the gene expression profiles of 12 gastric carcinoma cell lines, using cDNA microarray with 43 000 clones. For comparison, we also explored the gene expression patterns of 15 cell lines derived from lymphoid, endothelial, stromal and other epithelial cancers. Expression levels of specific genes were validated through comparison to protein expression by immunohistochemistry using cell block arrays. We found sets of genes whose expression corresponds to the molecular signature of each cell type. In the gastric cancer cell lines, apart from genes that are highly expressed corresponding to their common epithelial origin from the gastrointestinal tract, we found marked heterogeneity among the gene expression patterns of these cell lines. Some of the heterogeneity may reflect their underlying molecular characteristics or specific differentiation program. Two putative gastric carcinoma cell lines were found to be B-cell lymphoma, and another one had no epithelial specific gene expression and hence was of doubtful epithelial origin. These cell lines should no longer be used in gastric carcinoma research. In conclusion, our gene expression database can serve as a powerful resource for the study of gastric cancer using these cell lines."

Although snoRNP composition has been thoroughly characterized, the biogenesis process of these particles is poorly understood. We have identified two proteins from the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Yil104c/Shq1p and Ynl124w/Naf1p, which are essential and required for the stability of box H/ACA snoRNPs. Depletion of either Shq1p or Naf1p leads to a dramatic and specific decrease in box H/ACA snoRNA levels in vivo. A severe concomitant defect in ribosomal RNA processing is observed, consistent with the depletion of this family of snoRNAs. Shq1p and Naf1p show nuclear localization and interact with Nhp2p and Cbf5p, two core proteins of mature box H/ACA snoRNPs.

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) 1The abbreviations used are: snoRNP, small nucleolar (sno) ribonucleoprotein particles; HA, hemagglutinin; TAP, tandem affinity purification; NAF, nuclear association factor 1. are essential cofactors in ribosomal RNA metabolism. Although a few snoRNAs are necessary for discrete steps of the processing of the 35S pre-ribosomal RNA precursor, most of them are required to target modifications of the bases or of the sugar phosphate backbone within the ribosomal RNA precursor (for review, see Refs. 1Tollervey D. Kiss T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 337-342Google Scholar and 2Kiss T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3617-3622Google Scholar). snoRNAs can be divided into two major structural families (3Balakin A.G. Smith L. Fournier M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 823-834Google Scholar, 4Ganot P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 941-956Google Scholar) with different functions. Box C/D snoRNAs have been shown to guide methylation of the 2′-hydroxyl groups of the ribose moiety of numerous nucleotides in the 35S rRNA precursor (5Cavaille J. Nicoloso M. Bachellerie J.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 732-735Google Scholar, 6Kiss-Laszlo Z. Henry Y. Bachellerie J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Cell. 1996; 85: 1077-1088Google Scholar). Box H/ACA snoRNAs guide the pseudouridylation of the rRNA precursor (7Ganot P. Bortolin M.L. Kiss T. Cell. 1997; 89: 799-809Google Scholar, 8Ni J. Tien A.L. Fournier M.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 565-573Google Scholar). These small nucleolar RNAs do not function as isolated RNA molecules, but they assemble with protein complexes to form ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs). The protein composition of the two major families of snoRNPs has been extensively characterized. The protein core of the box C/D snoRNP is composed of Nop1p, Nop58p, Nop56p, and Snu13p (9Lafontaine D.L. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2650-2659Google Scholar, 10Watkins N.J. Segault V. Charpentier B. Nottrott S. Fabrizio P. Bachi A. Wilm M. Rosbash M. Branlant C. Luhrmann R. Cell. 2000; 103: 457-466Google Scholar) with Nop1p as the candidate methyltransferase (2Kiss T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3617-3622Google Scholar). The core of the box H/ACA snoRNP contains four proteins, Gar1p, Nhp2p, Nop10p, and Cbf5p, which is presumably responsible for the pseudouridyl synthetase activity (4Ganot P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Kiss T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 941-956Google Scholar, 11Girard J.P. Lehtonen H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Tollervey D. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 673-682Google Scholar, 12Lafontaine D.L.

Although the RNA motifs required for the association of the snoRNP proteins with the box H/ACA snoRNAs have been investigated (16Dragon F. Pogacic V. Filipowicz W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3037-3048Google Scholar, 17Henras A. Dez C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2733-2746Google Scholar), little is known about the mechanisms by which the RNA and the protein components become assembled into mature snoRNPs. Some box H/ACA snoRNAs are generated from independent transcription units, whereas others are embedded within the introns of other genes and must be processed from the excised introns after splicing (1Tollervey D. Kiss T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 337-342Google Scholar). Most independently transcribed box H/ACA snoRNAs are likely processed at their 3′ end by a complex that includes the Nrd1p and Sen1p proteins, presumably associated with RNA polymerase II (18Steinmetz E.J. Conrad N.K. Brow D.A. Corden J.L. Nature. 2001; 413: 327-331Google Scholar). A few independently transcribed box H/ACA snoRNAs also undergo 5′ end processing by the double-stranded RNA endonuclease Rnt1p (19Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Google Scholar). The packaging of box H/ACA snoRNAs into snoRNPs is likely to occur at an early stage of biogenesis, since unprocessed snoRNA precursor accumulation requires the presence of the box H/ACA snoRNPs Nhp2p and Nop10p (13Henras A. Henry Y. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Gelugne J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7078-7090Google Scholar). After or during the course of the maturation of the snoRNAs, the snoRNPs are exported to the nucleolar compartment to function in ribosomal RNA processing and/or modification. Whether fully mature or partially assembled snoRNPs species are exported to the nucleolus is a matter of debate. Recently a yeast putative RNA helicase was identified as an important factor for biogenesis of both box C/D and H/ACA snoRNPs (20King T.H. Decatur W.A. Bertrand E. Maxwell E.S. Fournier M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7731-7746Google Scholar). However the precise mechanisms by which the box C/D and box H/ACA snoRNPs assemble are likely to be different since both the RNA and the protein components differ. We present evidence that two novel essential yeast proteins, Yil104c and Ynl124w, are required specifically for accumulation of box H/ACA snoRNAs and interact with two components of the box H/ACA snoRNP, Nhp2p and Cbf5p. Because these two proteins are nuclear but do not seem to exhibit strong nucleolar localization, we propose that they participate in the early biogenesis of these snoRNPs. The two-hybrid screen with Rnt1p as bait was performed as described (21Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Google Scholar). Replacement of the YIL104C andYNL124W promoters by a galactose promoter and an HA-epitope was performed using a PCR-based procedure as described (22Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Google Scholar). Forin vivo depletion of Shq1p and Naf1p, after preculture in a medium containing galactose, strains were shifted in a rich medium containing 2% raffinose, 2% sucrose, and 2% galactose. RNA extraction and acrylamide Northern blot analysis were performed as in Chanfreau et al. (23Chanfreau G. Rotondo G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3726-3737Google Scholar). Agarose Northern blot was performed using standard protocols. The list of oligonucleotides used for snoRNA probes is indicated in Chanfreau et al. (19Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Google Scholar). The sequences of the rRNA oligonucleotide probes are: 5′ ETS, CGGAATGGTACGTTTGATATCGCTG; 3′ ETS, CCCGGATCATAGAATTC; A0rRNA, ACTATCTTAAAAGAAGAAGCAACAAGC; A1-A2, CGGTTTTAATTGTCCTA; A2-A3, ATGAAAACTCCACAGTG; ITS2, GGCCAGCAATTTCAAGTTA; 25 S, CTCCGCTTATTGATATGC; 18 S, CATGGCTTAATCTTTGAGAC. Tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged strains were generated as described (24Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitation of RNAs with IgG beads was performed as described (12Lafontaine D.L. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 527-537Google Scholar). Glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis was performed as described (25Billy E. Wegierski T. Nasr F. Filipowicz W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2115-2126Google Scholar) with the following modifications. For each strain, 1 liter of cells was harvested atA 600 nm 1.0 and resuspended in 1.5 ml of Buffer GG (5 mm MgCl2, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors tablet from Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cell paste was dropped in liquid N2 to form frozen droplets. Frozen droplets were then ground for 20 min in a mortar in the presence of liquid N2. Ground cells were thawed on ice, and the cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 30 min at 17,000 rpm in a Beckman JA25.50 rotor. Cleared lysates were then layered on a 10–36% glycerol gradient in Buffer GG. Samples were centrifuged for 24 h at 36,000 rpm in a Beckman SW-41 rotor. 500-μl fractions were collected of which 80 μl were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid for Western blot analysis, and the remainder was used for RNA extraction as described (19Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Google Scholar). Native sedimentation coefficient markers (Amersham Biosciences) were included in a gradient run in parallel and analyzed by silver staining. In vitro translation of proteins was performed using a TNT-T7 kit (Promega) using PCR products as in vitrotranscription-translation templates. For each open reading frame, the upstream primer contained a T7 promoter, the Kozak translation initiation sequence, and the beginning of the open reading frame, whereas the reverse primer contained the end of the open reading frame, the stop codon followed by a 20-nucleotide poly(T) tail at the 5′ end. PCR products were generated from genomic DNA using these two primers. Calmodulin-binding protein-tagged versions of Shq1p were obtained by PCR amplification of YIL104C using genomic DNA from the TAP-tagged Yil104c yeast strain with an upstream oligonucleotide containing a T7 promoter, the Kozak translation initiation sequence, and the beginning of the open reading frame and a reverse primer hybridizing to the calmodulin-binding protein tag at its 3′ end and containing a stop codon and a 20-nucleotide poly(T) tail at the 5′ end. PCR templates were incubated with reticulocyte lysate-T7 RNA polymerase mix from the Promega TNT kit and either unlabeled or [35S]methionine for 1 h. Calmodulin beads were washed 3 times for 5 min each with 1 ml of HEMN 200 buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol with complete protease inhibitors from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Translated products were incubated with 50 μl of prepared beads and 1 ml of HEMN 200 buffer at room temperature for 2 h with rotation. Beads were washed 4 times for 5 min with 1 ml of HEMN 200 buffer. Input and precipitates were boiled in SDS loading buffer and loaded on SDS gels. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described (26Goldman R.D. Leinwand L.A. Spector D.L. Cells: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 106.103-106.107Google Scholar). Yeast RNase III, Rnt1p, is required for processing of a large number of small nucleolar RNAs from both the box C/D and box H/ACA families (19Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Google Scholar, 23Chanfreau G. Rotondo G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3726-3737Google Scholar). To identify proteins that may influence RNase III cleavage in vivo, a two-hybrid screen was performed using Rnt1p as bait. Among the candidate clones, we found three clones corresponding to different fragments of the essential protein Yil104c (Fig.1 A). The junction of these fusion proteins was sequenced and was shown to correspond to positions 170769, 170925, and 170961 of chromosome IX (Fig. 1 B). TheYIL104C open reading frame spans positions 169979–171502 of chromosome IX. Because each fusion was about 1-kilobase long, as estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis, the portions of Yil104c that interact with Rnt1p in the two-hybrid assay correspond to the C-terminal 244, 192, and 180 amino acids of Yil104c (Fig.1 B). We tried to confirm the interaction between Yil104c and Rnt1p by immunoprecipitation or in vitro pull-down experiments, but we failed to detect a specific interaction by these methods (data not show). To characterize the function of Yil104c and its possible connection to yeast RNase III, we replaced theYIL104C endogenous promoter with a galactose-inducible promoter and an N-terminal HA epitope tag using homologous recombination. After preculture of the resulting strain in the presence of galactose, we shifted the yeast culture into a medium lacking galactose. The shift in culture conditions led to a rapid depletion of the protein, most of it being depleted after 3 h of growth in a medium lacking galactose (Fig.2 A). Because yeast RNase III is involved in the processing of small nuclear and small nucleolar RNAs (19Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Google Scholar, 27Chanfreau G. Abou Elela S. Ares Jr., M. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2741-2751Google Scholar), we examined the level of these species after Yil104c depletion. We monitored the levels of various small RNAs from both the box C/D and H/ACA families and from the spliceosomal RNA family. Northern blot analysis showed that box H/ACA snoRNAs were rapidly depleted after Yil104c depletion (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, box C/D snoRNAs and the RNA component of the RNase mitochondrial RNA processing ribonuclease complex were not affected by Yil104c depletion (Fig. 2 B). The U5 spliceosomal small nuclear RNA was also unaffected (data not shown). The apparent increase of the level of the some box C/D snoRNAs such as snR40 is probably due to the fact that after depletion of Yil104c, which leads to a ribosomal RNA-processing defect and to ribosomal RNA depletion (see Fig.3), other unaffected RNAs contribute proportionally more to the total RNA mass. The specific depletion of box H/ACA snoRNAs was unlikely to be due to a global depletion of box H/ACA snoRNP proteins, since the level of the box H/ACA snoRNP protein Nhp2p did not decrease significantly after Yil104c depletion (Fig. 2 A). We named Yil104c Shq1p because it is required for small nucleolar RNAs of the box H/ACA family quantitative accumulation.Figure 2Shq1p is required for box H/ACA snoRNAs accumulation.

Shown are regions of the blots identifying precursors, intermediates, and products that showed a processing defect.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next investigated whether the depletion of box H/ACA snoRNAs in Shq1p-depleted cells resulted in a defect in the processing of the precursor of rRNA. Such a processing defect would be expected, since depletion of the box H/ACA snoRNAs snR10 and snR30 is expected to block or to reduce the efficiency of several steps of the ribosomal RNA-processing pathway leading to the production of the 18 S rRNA (indicated in Fig. 3 A (28Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4169-4175Google Scholar,29Morrissey J.P. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2469-2477Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed on total RNAs isolated from Shq1p-depleted cells followed by hybridization with 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for various intermediates and mature rRNA species (Fig. 3 B). A strong accumulation of the 35S pre-rRNA was observed after the depletion of Shq1p, indicating a global effect on the maturation process of this precursor. In agreement with this observation, the accumulation of the normal processing intermediates 32 S, 27 S A2, and 20 S was strongly reduced. Furthermore, the aberrant 23 S intermediate, which extends from the 5′ end of the 35S pre-rRNA to the A3cleavage site was more abundant in Shq1p-depleted cells (Fig.3 B). This species results from cleavage of the primary transcript at the A3 site without prior cleavage at sites A0, A1, and A2, and it is rapidly degraded as an aberrant intermediate. The appearance of this aberrant intermediate indicates a defect in the early cleavage events of the primary transcript at the A0, A1, and A2 sites. The rapid degradation of this aberrant intermediate may be in part responsible for the observed defect in the production of the mature 18 S rRNA (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that the absence of Shq1p induces a defect or at least a delay in the early processing steps of the 35S rRNA precursor required for the production of the 18 S rRNA. This phenotype is likely due to the rapid depletion of snR10 and snR30, which are required for these steps (28Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4169-4175Google Scholar, 29Morrissey J.P. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2469-2477Google Scholar). Exhaustive two-hybrid screen analyses indicated that Shq1p interacts with an essential protein of the yeast genome, Ynl124w (30Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Google Scholar). Ynl124w also interacted with the box H/ACA snoRNP proteins Cbf5p and Nhp2p in the same study (30Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Google Scholar). Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis of proteins copurifying with an overexpressed FLAG-tagged version of Cbf5p identified Ynl124w and Shq1p (31Ho Y. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Google Scholar). Naf1p also shows sequence similarities with the box H/ACA snoRNP protein Gar1p and the RNA-binding protein Nrd1p in various regions of the protein sequence (Fig.4 A). These observations and our results showing that Shq1p is required for box H/ACA snoRNA accumulation suggested a role for Ynl124w in box H/ACA snoRNA metabolism. We therefore analyzed the function of the Ynl124w proteinin vivo using the same procedure described for Shq1p,i.e. conditional depletion of Ynl124w after the replacement of the YNL124W endogenous promoter with a galactose-inducible promoter and an N-terminal HA epitope tag. While this study was in progress, the YNL124W open reading frame became labeled in the Saccharomyces genome data base asNAF1 (nuclear association factor 1). We will therefore use the name Naf1p to describe the protein product of YNL124W. Upon depletion of Naf1p, we observed a rapid and specific depletion of box H/ACA snoRNAs, whereas the level of other small RNA species remained unchanged (Fig. 4 B). The level of Nhp2p was also unaffected after Naf1p depletion (data not shown), as observed during Shq1p depletion (Fig. 2 A). We conclude that Shq1p and Naf1p are similarly required for box H/ACA snoRNA accumulation. Not surprisingly, depletion of Naf1p resulted in ribosomal RNA processing defects (Fig. 4 C) that were similar to those observed during Shq1p depletion (Fig. 3 B). Because of the similarities of the phenotypes observed during Naf1p and Shq1p depletion, we checked whether the stability of Naf1p requires the presence of Shq1p. We constructed a yeast double-tagged strain (DT) where theGAL:HA-SHQ1 strain also carries a TAP (32Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 141-147Google Scholar)-tagged version of Naf1p. Upon depletion of Shq1p, the level of Naf1p remained constant (data not shown), suggesting that the stability of Naf1p does not require wild-type levels of Shq1p. A straightforward explanation for the rapid depletion of box H/ACA snoRNAs upon Shq1p and Naf1p depletion would be that Shq1p and Naf1p are integral components of box H/ACA snoRNPs but that they had not been identified in previous work studying the protein composition of box H/ACA snoRNPs. If this were the case, we would expect Shq1p and Naf1p to associate strongly and specifically with box H/ACA snoRNAs, as described previously for core proteins of box H/ACA snoRNPs (11Girard J.P. Lehtonen H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Tollervey D. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 673-682Google Scholar, 12Lafontaine D.L. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 527-537Google Scholar, 13Henras A. Henry Y. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Gelugne J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7078-7090Google Scholar, 14Watkins N.J. Gottschalk A. Neubauer G. Kastner B. Fabrizio P. Mann M. Luhrmann R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1549-1568Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we generated chromosomal TAP-tagged versions of Shq1p and Naf1p. The TAP-tagged versions of these two proteins were functional, since introduction of the TAP tag at the C terminus of these proteins did not induce a significant growth defect (data not shown). Extracts were first made from these two strains followed by incubation with IgG beads to bind the protein A portion of the TAP tag. After extensive washing, RNAs were extracted from the precipitates and detected by Northern blots. As a control for a weak association with box H/ACA snoRNAs, we used a TAP-tagged Nop1p strain, since it was shown previously that a protein A-tagged version of Nop1p is weakly associated with box H/ACA snoRNAs at low salt concentrations (12Lafontaine D.L. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 527-537Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that a small amount of box H/ACA snoRNAs were associated with Shq1p and Naf1p but not significantly higher than with an untagged control (Fig.5 A). In contrast, a weak but significant association could be detected with Nop1p. In addition, Nop1p was strongly associated with box C/D snoRNAs at both salt concentrations, whereas no significant association was found for Shq1p and Naf1p. The lack of strong association of both Shq1p and Naf1p with box H/ACA snoRNAs in whole-cell extracts suggests that Shq1p and Naf1p are not integral components of box H/ACA snoRNPs. To test whether Shq1p would associate specifically with the precursors of box H/ACA snoRNAs rather than with the mature species, we constructed a yeast strain carrying a deletion of RNT1 in addition to the TAP-tagged Shq1p. The RNT1 deletion results in accumulation of some box H/ACA snoRNA precursors (19Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of Shq1p-TAP precipitates in a rnt1 deletion background failed to reveal a significant association with the box H/ACA snoRNA precursors tested (snR36, snR43, and snR46, data not shown). Overall, these results suggest that Shq1p and Naf1p are not strongly associated with either precursors or mature box H/ACA snoRNAs. To investigate further the relationships between Shq1p, Naf1p, and box H/ACA snoRNPs, we prepared extracts from Shq1p-TAP- and Naf1-TAP-tagged strains as well as from the double-tagged strain (GAL:HA-SHQ1P, NAF1-TAP), and we fractionated them by centrifugation on glycerol gradients. We followed the sedimentation profiles of TAP-tagged Naf1p and Shq1p by Western blot and compared them with the sedimentation profile of the snR42 box H/ACA snoRNA and of the box H/ACA snoRNP protein Nhp2p. The peak of Shq1p-TAP was found in fraction 18. Two peaks of Naf1p sedimentation were observed, one of which was in the heavier fractions that may correspond to the rRNA complexes, since rRNAs were also observed in these fractions. The second peak corresponded to fraction 18, where the bulk of Naf1p sediments and the major peak of Shq1p were also observed. Box H/ACA snoRNP components (snr42 and Nhp2p) were found throughout several fractions of the gradient, but no enrichment of these components was found in fraction 18. To confirm the cosedimentation of Shq1p and Naf1p in fraction 18, we used the double-tagged strain where Shq1p is HA-tagged and Naf1p is TAP-tagged. This strain allowed the detection of both proteins in the same gradient fractions. Western blot analysis of sedimentation profiles in this double-tagged strain confirmed the cosedimentation of these two proteins in fraction 18. Strikingly, we found a third peak of sedimentation of Naf1-TAP in the glycerol gradient fractions made from this double-tagged strain. This third peak in fractions 6–7 overlapped with the major position of box H/ACA snoRNPs. We also found that there was much less Naf1p present in fraction 18 than in the single-tagged Naf1-TAP strain. In contrast to the Naf1-TAP strain, where most of the Naf1p protein was present in fraction 18, the bulk of the Naf1p protein in the double-tagged strain was located in higher sedimentation coefficient fractions and much less in fraction 18. This result is possibly due to a deleterious effect of the double tag, since this double-tagged strain showed a significant growth defect compared with a wild-type strain or a single-tagged strain (data not shown). This negative effect of the double tag might result in a stabilization of transient interactions with box H/ACA snoRNPs that are otherwise not revealed in a gradient made from a single tagged strain. This suggests that transient interactions may exist between Naf1p and box H/ACA snoRNPs. This result is consistent with immunoprecipitation results from Dez et al. (36Dez C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Henry Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 7053-7065Google Scholar) who showed that Naf1p immunoprecipitates a small but significant amount of box H/ACA snoRNAs. Overall these experiments suggest that Shq1p and Naf1p exist as a complex of two or more proteins that are probably not associated with box H/ACA snoRNPs and would correspond to fraction 18 of the gradient. In addition, the result obtained with the double-tagged strain, which showed a cosedimentation of Naf1p with box H/ACA snoRNPs, suggested that Naf1p may interact transiently with box H/ACA snoRNPs and that this interaction may be stabilized in the double-tagged strain. Two-hybrid studies suggested a direct interaction between Shq1p and Naf1p and between Naf1p and both Nhp2p and Cbf5p (30Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Google Scholar). In addition, genome-scale protein purification and mass spectrometry studies showed that Shq1p as well as Naf1p copurified with overexpressed FLAG-tagged Cbf5p, the pseudouridyl synthetase (31Ho Y. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Google Scholar). This result as well as our glycerol gradient sedimentation results (Fig.5 B) suggested an association between these proteins in vivo. We tested for in vitro interactions between Shq1p and either Naf1p, Nhp2p, or other box H/ACA snoRNP proteins (Cbf5p and Gar1p) using an in vitro translation pull-down approach. We translated Naf1p, Nhp2p, Cbf5p, and Gar1p in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated these labeled proteins with unlabeled in vitro translated Shq1p, either untagged or tagged at the C terminus with a calmodulin-binding protein tag. The proteins were then mixed with calmodulin beads and extensively washed, and the presence of the radiolabeled proteins associated with the beads and hence with Shq1p was revealed by autoradiography (Fig.6). This experiment showed that both Naf1p and Nhp2p bind to Shq1p when these proteins are generatedin vitro by translation in reticulocyte lysates. In contrast, in vitro translated Gar1p did not bind to in vitro translated Shq1p, although we do not know whether in vitro translated Gar1p is folded properly and, therefore, active in this assay. The interaction between Shq1p and both Nhp2p and Naf1p was specific since no binding was detected with beads and reticulocyte lysate alone or with untagged in vitro translated Shq1p. When in vitro translated Cbf5p was used in these studies, it bound non-specifically to beads alone (data not shown), precluding any analysis of the interaction between Shq1p and this particular protein. These data demonstrate that Naf1p interacts with Shq1p in vitro in reticulocyte lysates, as suggested from published two-hybrid studies (30Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Google Scholar). Although proteins present in the cell lysate may bridge two proteins and result in indirect interactions, our results also suggest that Shq1p can bind directly to Nhp2p, showing an additional novel link between Shq1p and a component of the mature box H/ACA snoRNPs. To better understand the function of Shq1p and Naf1p, we analyzed their subcellular localization. We used the GAL-HA-tagged strains described above to perform immunolocalization using the anti-hemagglutinin 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. When compared with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, the two proteins clearly showed a nuclear localization pattern (Fig.7). Shq1p seemed to be excluded from a crescent-shaped nuclear territory, which was reminiscent of the nucleolus, suggesting that it was not localized in the nucleolus. The exclusion from the nucleolus would fit the result described above that Shq1p and Naf1p are not core components of mature box H/ACA snoRNPs, which are mainly localized in the nucleolus at the steady state. Our results also fit with the observation that Naf1p is nucleoplasmic but does not localize to the nucleolus (36Dez C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Henry Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 7053-7065Google Scholar, 37Fatica A. Dlakic M. Tollervey D. RNA. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). The localization of Shq1p does not fit with the whole-genome localization studies from the Snyder group (ygac.med.yale.edu/ygac-cgi/loc_oe_qry.pl?gene_name=yil104c& localization=), who reported that a V5-tagged version of Shq1p is cytoplasmic. However, given the function of Shq1p in box H/ACA snoRNA metabolism, it is more likely that the nuclear localization that we observe is more representative of its biological function and that the V5 tag used may have interfered with proper localization of the protein. We have described two proteins, Shq1p and Naf1p, that are required for box H/ACA snoRNA accumulation. In the absence of these proteins, box H/ACA snoRNAs become depleted, resulting in a dramatic inhibition of pre-ribosomal RNA processing and presumably in the inhibition of ribosomal RNA pseudouridylation, as described previously for protein members of the box H/ACA snoRNPs (12Lafontaine D.L. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Henry Y. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 527-537Google Scholar, 13Henras A. Henry Y. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Gelugne J.P. Caizergues-Ferrer M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7078-7090Google Scholar). However, in contrast to these core proteins, Shq1p and Naf1p are not associated with precursor or mature box H/ACA snoRNAs. Moreover, although they are clearly localized in the nucleus, they seem to be absent from the nucleolus. Our data are consistent with results obtained in Dr. Yves Henry, Dr. Michelle Caizergues-Ferrer, and Dr. David Tollervey's groups who showed that Naf1p is a nucleoplasmic protein required for box H/ACA snoRNA accumulation (36Dez C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Henry Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 7053-7065Google Scholar, 37Fatica A. Dlakic M. Tollervey D. RNA. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). We originally studied the function of Shq1p based on a two-hybrid interaction with yeast RNase III, Rnt1p. Rnt1p has been shown to process three box H/ACA snoRNAs at their 5′ end (19Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Google Scholar). We failed to find an interaction between Rnt1p and Shq1p by other means than the two-hybrid assay, and the search of various yeast proteomics databases did not indicate an interaction between these two proteins. It is possible that the two-hybrid interaction between Rnt1p and Shq1p is fortuitous and cannot be reproduced by other ways than the two-hybrid assay. Another possibility is that Rnt1p interacts only with a C-terminal domain of Shq1p but that interaction with the full-length Shq1p protein cannot be observed. However, we think that given the functions of both Rnt1p and Shq1p in early box H/ACA snoRNA metabolism, it is likely that this two-hybrid interaction indicates a weak but significant interaction, which could be relevant in early box H/ACA snoRNA biogenesis. One possibility would be that Rnt1p recruits Shq1p at the vicinity of the box H/ACA snoRNAs and that this recruitment would help to enhance the rate of packaging of just-processed snoRNAs into snoRNPs. This interaction would be relevant to only a few snoRNAs, since most box H/ACA snoRNAs do not seem to be processed by Rnt1p (19Chanfreau G. Legrain P. Jacquier A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 975-988Google Scholar). Another possibility would be that Shq1p helps to recruit Rnt1p at the vicinity of the snoRNA precursors processed by Rnt1p. In this case, we would expect to detect an accumulation of unprocessed snR36, snR43, and snR46 upon Shq1p depletion. These extended unprocessed species were not detected in RNAs extracted from Shq1p-depleted cells (data not shown). However, since depletion of Shq1p results in a rapid depletion of snoRNAs, it is possible that the rapid turnover of snoRNAs precursors when they are no longer packaged into snoRNPs may mask any effect on the processing efficiency. Thus, the potential role of the Rnt1p-Shq1p interaction in the processing of box H/ACA snoRNAs may be difficult to demonstrate. Finally, the recent demonstration of an interaction between Rnt1p and Gar1p (33Tremblay A. Lamontagne B. Catala M. Yam Y. Larose S. Good L. Abou Elela S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4792-4802Google Scholar) strengthens the potential link between Rnt1p and proteins of box H/ACA snoRNPs. Based on the data presented in this study and on proteomics studies, we can propose the following model to describe the function of Shq1p and Naf1p in box H/ACA snoRNP biogenesis. Proteomics studies and ourin vitro interaction studies show that Shq1p and Naf1p associate with each other and with some protein components of the box H/ACA snoRNP such as Cbf5p, the putative pseudouridyl synthetase, and Nhp2p. Our glycerol gradient cosedimentation data are also consistent with the idea that Shq1p and Naf1p interact with each other and form a complex. Naf1p was independently identified by Fatica and Tollervey as a protein with an RNA binding motif and was shown to possess RNA binding activity in vitro (37Fatica A. Dlakic M. Tollervey D. RNA. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). The sequence similarities between Naf1p and Gar1p and Nrd1p (Fig. 4 A) also suggest a role for Naf1p in box H/ACA snoRNA metabolism. Because Shq1p and Naf1p are mainly localized in the nucleoplasm, we propose that they may associate weakly and transiently with newly transcribed box H/ACA snoRNAs in the nucleoplasmic compartment. In favor of this model, Dezet al. (36Dez C. Noaillac-Depeyre J. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Henry Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 20: 7053-7065Google Scholar) could show a weak but significant association of Naf1p with box H/ACA snoRNAs. In addition, a double-tagged strain, which shows a significant growth defect, also results in cosedimentation of Naf1p with the box H/ACA snoRNPs, suggesting that transient interactions between Naf1p and components of the box H/ACA snoRNP may be stabilized in that strain. In this model Naf1p would remain bound to partially or fully assembled snoRNPs, resulting in partially dysfunctional snoRNPs and, therefore, in a growth defect. In favor of a model of co-transcriptional recruitment, Fatica et al. showed that Naf1p interacts with the phosphorylated CTD of RNA polymerase II using GST-pull down and two-hybrid studies (37Fatica A. Dlakic M. Tollervey D. RNA. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition to its RNA binding properties, the association of Naf1p with the elongation form of RNA polymerase II further supports the hypothesis that Naf1p and possibly Shq1p play an early role in box H/ACA snoRNA biogenesis. The association of Shq1p and Naf1p with newly transcribed box H/ACA snoRNAs would occur in a complex with Cbf5p and Nhp2p (30Ito T. Chiba T. Ozawa R. Yoshida M. Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4569-4574Google Scholar, 31Ho Y. et al.Nature. 2002; 415: 180-183Google Scholar). This interaction could bring Cbf5p and Nhp2p at the vicinity of box H/ACA snoRNAs to form the initial core of the box H/ACA snoRNP and, thus, nucleate the formation of the mature snoRNP. In this model, Cbf5p and Nhp2p would bind first and would then recruit Gar1p and Nop10p. This model would fit in vitro reconstitution results showing that the binding of human Gar1p is not a prerequisite for binding of other box H/ACA snoRNP proteins (16Dragon F. Pogacic V. Filipowicz W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3037-3048Google Scholar) and with the fact that Gar1p is not required for box H/ACA snoRNA stability in yeast cells (11Girard J.P. Lehtonen H. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Amalric F. Tollervey D. Lapeyre B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 673-682Google Scholar). Whatever the role of these proteins, it seems likely that their function is conserved among eukaryotes. Both proteins are essential inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, and orthologs can be found in other eukaryotic genomes. Shq1p seems to be the most conserved protein of the two, since orthologs of Shq1p/Yil104c can be found in humans (FLJ10539), Drosophila melanogaster (CG10055),Caenorhabditis elegans (Y48A5A.1), andSchizosaccharomyces pombe (Pi052p), whereas orthologs of Naf1p/Shq2p are present in human (ALF), mice (SMPD3), andS. pombe (Spbc30d10.15p), but no obvious orthologs are indicated in the databases for D. melanogaster orC. elegans. Whether a protein similar to Naf1p is truly absent from these two organisms or whether an ortholog with a very weak sequence similarity is present is not clear. Strikingly, Naf1p shows limited similarities with ALF, a transcription factor with similarity to the transcription factor TFIIA-α/β. This sequence similarity between Naf1p and a putative transcription factor further supports the model that Naf1p may associate with the transcription machinery to interact with newly transcribed box H/ACA snoRNAs. It seems likely that given the conservation of Shq1p and Naf1, similar functions will be found for its orthologs in box H/ACA snoRNA metabolism in higher eukaryotes. It would also be interesting to test whether the human orthologs of Shq1p and Naf1p have any putative function in telomerase RNA metabolism, since the human telomerase RNA shows motifs that are characteristic of box H/ACA snoRNAs (15Pogacic V. Dragon F. Filipowicz W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9028-9040Google Scholar, 16Dragon F. Pogacic V. Filipowicz W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3037-3048Google Scholar, 34Mitchell J.R. Cheng J.

Thus, the function of the Shq1p and/Naf1p proteins could be extended not only to box H/ACA snoRNA metabolism but also to human telomerase RNA biogenesis.

Unlike the zymogen form of most serine proteases, the single-chain form of t-PA (sct-PA) retains roughly 10–25% of the enzymatic activity of the mature two-chain form (tct-PA) (1Boose J.A. Kuismanen E. Gerard R. Sambrook J. Gething M.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 28: 635-643Google Scholar, 2Ranby M. Bergsdorf N. Nilsson T. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27 (suppl.): 175-183Google Scholar, 3Tachias K. Madison E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28-31Google Scholar). Because both sct-PA and tct-PA are active enzymes, inhibition of t-PA activity, rather than maintenance of the protease in zymogen form, is necessary to prevent undesired proteolysis. In plasma, the physiologic or cognate inhibitor of t-PA appears to be the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) (4Kruithof E.K. Tran-Thang C. Ransign A. Bachmann F. Blood. 1984; 64: 907-913Google Scholar). In addition to its role in maintaining vascular hemostasis, t-PA is a key extravascular protease in the central and peripheral nervous systems. t-PA can be detected on the axonal growth cone of developing neuroblasts (5Pittman R.N. Ivins J.K. Buettner H.M. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 4269-4289Google Scholar) and is involved with motor learning and memory (6Calabresi P. Napolitano M. Centonze D. Marfia G.A. Gubellini P. Teule M.A. Berretta N. Bernardi G. Frati L. Tolu M. Gulino A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 1002-1012Google Scholar). Studies in t-PA null mice have shown that t-PA enzymatic activity mediates neuronal cell death associated with both seizure kindling and ischemia and is involved with myelinated nerve regeneration following nerve crush injury (7Tsirka S.E.

Degen J.L. Strickland S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1157-1166Google Scholar). To date, the mechanism by which t-PA activity in the nervous system is regulated is unknown, although several studies have suggested that the recently described serpin, neuroserpin (NSP), may serve this function (10Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenshild C.C. Stefansson S. Smith E.P. Barthlow R. Cherry S. Sandkvist M. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33062-33067Google Scholar, 11Osterwalder T. Cinelli P. Baicia A. Pennella A. Krueger S.R. Schrimpf S.P. Meins M. Sonderegger P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2312-2321Google Scholar). NSP is an ∼45-kDa glycosylated serpin that is expressed almost exclusively in the nervous system throughout embryologic development and adulthood (12Krueger S.R. Ghisu G.P. Cinelli P. Gschwend T.P. Osterwalder T. Wolfer D.P. Sonderegger P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8984-8996Google Scholar). NSP inhibits the enzymatic activity of t-PA in vitro (10Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenshild C.C. Stefansson S. Smith E.P. Barthlow R. Cherry S. Sandkvist M. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33062-33067Google Scholar), and pharmacologic administration of NSP to rats that have undergone middle cerebral artery occlusion decreases the volume of the ischemic penumbral area concomitant with inhibition of t-PA enzymatic activity (13Yepes M. Sandkvist M. Wong M.K. Coleman T.A. Smith E. Cohan S.L. Lawrence D.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 569-576Google Scholar). Also, transgenic mice that overexpress NSP show a decreased volume of neuronal cell death following middle cerebral artery occlusion compared with their wild type counterparts (14Cinelli P. Madani R. Tsuzuki N. Vallet P. Arras M. Zhao C.N. Osterwalder T. Rulicke T. Sonderegger P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 443-457Google Scholar). It is presumed that NSP inhibits t-PA in a manner analogous to PAI-1 to mediate these effects. Serpins inhibit the enzymatic activity of their cognate serine proteases via initial formation of a Michaelis complex in which the enzyme is reversibly bound and inhibited by the serpin (15Ye S.

The protease initiates cleavage of the scissile peptide bond between the P1 and P1′ residues of the reactive center loop, which leads to the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate, with the active site serine covalently bound to the P1 residue (16Lawrence D.A.

However, presumably before this intermediate can be hydrolyzed to yield cleaved serpin and active protease (i.e. completion of the cleavage reaction), the protease, bound to the P1 residue of the serpin, is translocated to the opposite pole of the serpin (18Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of the translocated protease active site is sufficiently disrupted to prevent hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme complex (19Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Google Scholar), making the rate of deacylation extremely slow (i.e. weeks). The complexes display new molecular determinants that allow for cellular internalization and degradation in a matter of minutes (20Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Google Scholar). Therefore, protease-serpin acyl-enzyme complex formation can usually be viewed as biologically irreversible. The work presented here demonstrates that the interaction of NSP with its putative cognate protease, t-PA, differs from the currently held paradigm in that the acyl-enzyme intermediates between t-PA and NSP are much less stable than other cognate protease-serpin complexes. Indeed, t-PA seems to handle NSP more like a substrate than a suicide inhibitor, with the acyl-enzyme complex being a detectable intermediate. These findings may provide insights into the physiologic interaction between NSP and t-PA, which may differ from certain functions inferred from studies with pharmacological concentrations of NSP in animal models. Sct-PA (greater than 95% single-chain t-PA) isolated from Bowes melanoma cells was purchased from Biopool and from Calbiochem. Tct-PA was generated by treating sct-PA with plasmin linked to Sepharose beads (plasmin-Sepharose) at 37 °C for times determined in preliminary experiments, to yield complete cleavage of sct-PA by that batch of plasmin-Sepharose as determined by silver staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels run under reducing conditions. Human scu-PA was a generous gift from Dr. Jack Henkin of Abbott Laboratories. Human tcu-PA (Winkinase) was obtained from Dr. Gene Murano, Monsanto, St. Louis, MO. The cDNA for human NSP was obtained from Human Genome Sciences, Rockville, MD. Recombinant human NSP was expressed and purified from a baculovirus-based system. PAI-1 (14-1b mutant) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (10Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenshild C.C. Stefansson S. Smith E.P. Barthlow R. Cherry S.

Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Google Scholar) and was ∼50% active as measured by stable inhibition of tct-PA. Polyclonal antibodies against NSP were generated in rabbits (10Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A.

Plasminogen was radioiodinated as described previously (22Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Google Scholar, 23Schwartz B.S. Espana F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15278-15283Google Scholar). Plasmin, aprotinin, and spectrozyme t-PA were purchased from American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT. Bovine serum albumin, obtained from Sigma, was treated with 100 μm diisopropyl fluorophosphate to inhibit potentially contaminating serine proteases, followed by exhaustive dialysis. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was purchased from Pierce. Kodak 1-D Image software was used to digitize and quantify bands on autoradiograms and Western blots. All electrophoresis and protein transfers were carried out in the Bio-Rad Mini-protein 3 system. Electrophoresis reagents and precast 8–16% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels were purchased from Bio-Rad. 10% polyacrylamide gels with a 3% stacking gel or precast 8–16% gels with a 4% stacking gel were used as noted in each figure legend. The gradient gel system was selected for optimal separation of 40- and 45-kDa NSP species but does not allow for optimal detection of NSP·t-PA acyl-enzyme complexes. A 10% separating gel was used for experiments in which optimal detection of NSP·t-PA acyl-enzyme complexes was necessary. NSP was detected immunologically after electrophoresis by electroblotting proteins from the gel to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 1 h at 100 V (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Google Scholar, 25Gallagher S.

Membranes were then blocked with Tris-buffered saline, 0.01m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.2, containing 0.05% Tween and 0.25% gelatin and then blotted with a 1:5000 dilution of rabbit antibody against NSP (10Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenshild C.C. Stefansson S. Smith E.P. Barthlow R. Cherry S. Sandkvist M. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol.

Membranes were then rinsed several times in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween and subsequently treated with Pierce West Super Pico Enhanced Chemiluminescence Reagent, then exposed to film. Assays to monitor the cleavage of125I-plasminogen were performed as described previously (26Mussoni L. Lawrence D. Loskutoff D.L. Thromb. Res. 1984; 34 (suppl.): 241-254Google Scholar). Plasminogen activation was quantified by measuring the plasmin light chain band (26Mussoni L. Lawrence D. Loskutoff D.L. Thromb. Res. 1984; 34 (suppl.): 241-254Google Scholar). The percentage of t-PA activity remaining for each concentration of inhibitor was determined by the formula, %t­PA activity=100×(density of plasmin light chain in reaction with inhibitor)(density of plasmin light chain in reaction with uninhibited t­PA)Equation 1 Assays of t-PA activity using chromogenic substrates were performed in Tris-imidazole buffer, ionic strength 0.3, pH 8.4, at room temperature. t-PA and serpin (145–150 nm each) were incubated for the indicated times followed by the addition of spectrozyme t-PA at a final concentration of 500 μm. The kinetics program on a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer was used at 1 reading/s at 440 nm for 1 min. Measurements were normalized to exclude substrate autohydrolysis (measured in parallel reactions lacking t-PA). The percentage of active t-PA was determined by the formula,%t­PA activity=100×(rate of Spec­t­PA cleavage in the presence of inhibitor)(rate of t­PA control Spec­t­PA cleavage in the absence of inhibitor)Equation 2 Inhibition profiles were graphed using Prism 3 software. NSP and the specified protease were incubated at the indicated concentrations, temperatures, and times in buffer containing 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described. Detection of highMr bands as would be expected for a complex between that protease and NSP was taken as evidence of acyl-enzyme formation (10Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenshild C.C. Stefansson S.

Detection of an ∼40-kDa band by anti-NSP antibody was consistent with complete cleavage of NSP and hence of deacylation. NSP (12 μg) and tct-PA (2.8 μg) or plasmin (2.8 μg) were combined in a 10-μl total volume for 40 min at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 3% stacking, 10% spacing, and 20% separating SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (27Schagger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 201-205Google Scholar). Coomassie Blue-stained peptide bands were then excised and subjected to Edman degradation analysis using a Procise 494HT (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) peptide sequence apparatus. In agreement with previous findings, NSP inhibited t-PA cleavage of the chromogenic substrate spectrozyme t-PA (Table I) (10Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenshild C.C. Stefansson S. Smith E.P. Barthlow R. Cherry S. Sandkvist M. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33062-33067Google Scholar). However, NSP was a poor inhibitor of t-PA cleavage of125I-plasminogen, even at a 1000-fold molar excess of serpin over either sct-PA or tct-PA (Fig.1, Table I). This was not because of some unique aspect of the 125I-plasminogen cleavage assays, as PAI-1 efficiently inhibited both forms of t-PA in parallel125I-plasminogen cleavage assays, with the previously described differential susceptibility of the single-chain and two-chain forms of t-PA to PAI-1 inhibition (4Kruithof E.K. Tran-Thang C. Ransign A. Bachmann F. Blood. 1984; 64: 907-913Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).Table It-PA inhibition by neuroserpin: variation according to assayProtease concentration (nM)Concentration of NSP (nM)TimeSubstrate% InhibitionTct-PA (1.7)1424 h51 nm125I-plasminogen4Tct-PA (144)1441 min500 μm Spec t-PA47Sct-PA (1.7)1424 h51 nm125I-plasminogen14Sct-PA (144)1505 min500 μm Spec t-PA45NSP is a more effective t-PA inhibitor in a rapid chromogenic substrate-based assay than in a longer assay that directly measures the cleavage of plasminogen to plasmin. The assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab NSP is a more effective t-PA inhibitor in a rapid chromogenic substrate-based assay than in a longer assay that directly measures the cleavage of plasminogen to plasmin. The assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The assays monitoring cleavage of chromogenic substrate and125I-plasminogen differ not only in the substrate being cleaved but also in the time frame of the reactions. The125I-plasminogen cleavage reaction requires hours for evidence of t-PA activity to be detectable, whereas only minutes are needed for the chromogenic substrate based assay. The difference in t-PA inhibition by NSP seen in these two assays suggests that the inhibition of t-PA by NSP may be a function of time. To investigate the time-dependence of t-PA-NSP interaction, each form of t-PA was combined with NSP at 37 °C, and the fate of NSP was followed as the reactions progressed (Fig. 2). At early time points, NSP and either sct-PA or tct-PA yielded a product characteristic of acyl-enzyme complex formation (highM r band). However, at subsequent time points the intensity of the acyl-enzyme band decreased, and coincident with this an ∼40-kDa band was observed, suggesting that NSP in complex with t-PA was undergoing completion of the cleavage reaction. Both the appearance of acyl-enzyme complexes and their presumed hydrolysis occurred much more rapidly with two-chain than with single-chain t-PA, consistent with the greater catalytic efficiency of tct-PA in solution. These results suggest that, similar to PAI-1, NSP inhibits t-PA via acyl-enzyme complex formation (inhibition detected in assay over short time). However, in contrast to t-PA·PAI-1, t-PA·NSP acyl-enzyme complexes are relatively unstable, undergoing deacylation in a matter of minutes (assays requiring longer time courses do not detect this transient inhibition). These data suggest that the acyl-enzyme complex between either form of t-PA and NSP might be characterized as a “stutter-step,” e.g. a detectable intermediate in the process of peptide bond cleavage by the protease. An interesting structural implication is that the deformation of the active site that accompanies rearrangement of protease-serpin pairs may not be as extensive for t-PA·NSP as for other protease-serpin pairs. To determine whether such transient acyl-enzyme complexes are a property of NSP interactions with any protease, reactions between plasmin and NSP and between u-PA and NSP were examined. Fig.3 demonstrates that plasmin efficiently cleaves NSP with no detection of plasmin-NSP complexes. Fig.4 demonstrates that scu-PA yields neither detectable complex formation with nor cleavage of NSP; whereas tcu-PA cleaves NSP with a trace of transient acyl-enzyme complexes detected on overexposed autoradiograms (not shown). Hence, the existence of a quantitatively significant acyl-enzyme intermediate seems to be a unique property of the NSP-t-PA interaction.Figure 4u-PA does not form acyl-enzyme complexes with NSP. NSP (14 nm) alone (first lane of each gel) or with scu-PA (14 nm; A) or tcu-PA (14 nm; B) was incubated for the times indicated at 37 °C. In B,second lane, 14 nmtct-PA and 14 nm NSP were incubated for the indicated time at 37 °C for a comparison of the extent of NSP cleaved by tct-PA and by tcu-PA within the same time frame and under the same conditions. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Examination of the amino acid sequence of the reactive center loop of NSP suggests three potential sites for cleavage by trypsin-like proteases Arg362, Arg384, and Arg393. Thus, it was conceivable that different proteases hydrolyze different peptide bonds in NSP, with the one targeted by t-PA yielding a loop of the appropriate length to allow for translocation of the protease in a transiently stable arrangement and the site targeted by plasmin yielding a loop that was too long for stabilization of the intermediate (28Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Google Scholar). However, for both enzymes, the target P1-P1′ bond was determined to be Arg362–Met363 by N-terminal sequencing of the C-terminal cleavage peptide (TableII). Hence, plasmin and t-PA both cleave the same P1-P1′ bond, but the outcome of the interaction of t-PA with NSP is a detectable albeit transient acyl-enzyme, whereas plasmin treats NSP solely as a substrate without evidence of the covalent serpin-protease complex. It is not clear whether this reflects a more rapid rate of deacylation by plasmin such that there is insufficient time for translocation (18Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Google Scholar) or whether the different surface topographies of the proteases result in a molecular alignment between NSP and plasmin that is suboptimal for the active site deformation required for a detectable acyl-enzyme complex.Table IIDetermination of the proteolytic cleavage site in neuroserpinResiduePlasmin digest of NSPTct-PA digest of NSPNSP sequence from residue 263–273 (33)P1′MetMetMetP2′Alah, aAlaP3′ValValValP4′LeuLeuLeuP5′TyrTyrTyrP6′ProProProP7′GlnSerGlnP8′ValValP9′IleIleP10′ValValPlasmin and t-PA both cleave NSP at the same residue of the reactive center loop.

Open table in a new tab Plasmin and t-PA both cleave NSP at the same residue of the reactive center loop. NSP was incubated with either plasmin or tct-PA. The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the C-terminal peptide of NSP generated by proteolytic cleavage was subjected to Edman degradation analysis. To ensure that the observed transient stability of t-PA·NSP acyl-enzyme complexes was a true reflection of the protein properties and not a function of an SDS-PAGE-based assay (29Gaussem P. Grailhe P. Angles-Cano E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12150-12155Google Scholar, 30Gils A. Declerck P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 286-291Google Scholar), a chromogenic substrate-based assay of t-PA enzymatic activity was used. Equimolar amounts of NSP and t-PA were incubated for increasing times, t-PA enzymatic activity was monitored via cleavage of chromogenic substrate (Fig. 5, A and B), and aliquots of the same reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to determine the fate of the NSP (Fig. 5, Cand D). Fig. 5 demonstrates that with increasing time, the enzymatic activity of t-PA that had been inhibited by NSP was recovered (Fig. 5, A and B, enzymatic activity), concomitant with the generation of cleaved NSP (Fig. 5, Cand D; the appearance of the 40-kDa cleavage product demonstrating deacylation had occurred). Control experiments with t-PA inhibition by PAI-1 (Fig. 5, A and B) yielded no recovery of enzymatic activity of either form of t-PA subsequent to their interaction with PAI-1. Hence, the transient stability of t-PA·NSP acyl-enzyme complexes is a property of the reactants and is not a function of the assay. In addition, these data demonstrate that functional t-PA is recovered with deacylation of t-PA·NSP complexes. Figs. 2 and 5 also demonstrate that NSP cleavage by either form of t-PA proceeds via the transient acyl-enzyme intermediate, with little evidence for a NSP population that acts as a pure t-PA substrate. Slowing the reaction by carrying it out at 4 °C revealed that cleaved NSP was preceded by the appearance of acyl-enzyme complexes (Fig. 6). Hence, even under conditions that favor substrate behavior by serpins (lowering the reaction temperature fosters the substrate behavior of serpins due to slowing of protease translocation, a temperature-sensitive process, with little influence on deacylation) (31Kjoller L. Martensen P.M. Sottrup-Jensen L. Justesen J. Rodenburg K.W. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 38-46Google Scholar), all NSP proceeds to cleavage via the acyl-enzyme intermediate. In addition, all of the NSP is eventually cleaved, without evidence of a latent form of the serpin (Fig. 2 for tct-PA, not shown for sct-PA). Therefore, NSP appears to act as a single population of molecules that is cleaved by t-PA via transition through a detectable acyl-enzyme intermediate. The data presented thus far suggest that the interactions between NSP and t-PA are more similar to cleavage of a substrate with a protracted intermediate than the biologically irreversible inhibition usually associated with serpins. If this is the case, inclusion of NSP in an assay that measures t-PA enzymatic activity over a time period that allows deacylation to occur should yield a pattern more similar to that of a substrate than to the pattern seen with PAI-1. To test this hypothesis, the inhibition profiles of sct-PA- and tct-PA-mediated125I-plasminogen cleavage by PAI-1, NSP, and a physiologic substrate, unlabeled plasminogen, were compared. The NSP inhibition profiles of both forms of t-PA are very similar to the profiles of inhibition by a competitive substrate, unlabeled plasminogen, and differ from the inhibition profiles of PAI-1 (Fig.7). This difference is unlikely to be due solely to differences in affinities of t-PA for PAI-1 versusNSP, as the time to onset and extent of maximal protease inhibition by PAI-1 and NSP appeared to be similar in the chromogenic substrate-based assays detailed in Fig. 5. It seems that NSP is neither a pure inhibitor nor a pure substrate of t-PA, as the rate of NSP-t-PA acyl-enzyme complex deacylation in vitro is rapid enough to make inhibition transient, at best, but slow enough to constitute a significant kinetic stutter step in the substrate behavior of NSP and therefore to interrupt proteolysis of an alternative substrate by t-PA. Such an interpretation is consistent with the protective effects seen with transgene-driven overexpression of NSP or with the administration of pharmacological concentrations of NSP into the central nervous system of mice with middle cerebral artery occlusion (13Yepes M. Sandkvist M. Wong M.K. Coleman T.A. Smith E. Cohan S.L. Lawrence D.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 569-576Google Scholar, 16Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. Day D.E. Berkenpas M.B. Verhamme I.M. Kvassman J.O. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25309-25312Google Scholar). Another aspect to be considered is the effect of plasmin on NSP-sensitive processes. If t-PA effect in the central nervous system is plasminogen-dependent, as much data suggest (32Chen Z.L. Strickland S. Cell. 1997; 91: 917-925Google Scholar), the rapid and efficient cleavage of NSP by plasmin will have to be considered and balanced against the blunting of plasmin generation by NSP. Likewise, if NSP is ultimately cleaved by both t-PA and plasmin, a potential but heretofore unknown function for cleaved NSP may be part of the process. According to its predicted structure, NSP bears a series of negatively charged residues in an alignment similar to the positively charged residues on the face of the D-helix in certain serpins that bind heparin with resultant augmented inhibitory activity (33Osterwalder T. Contartese J. Stoeckli E.T. Kuhn T.B. Sonderegger P. EMBO. 1996; 15: 2944-2953Google Scholar). As such, there is the possibility that a positively charged cofactor binds NSP and augments or stabilizes its inhibitory activity. Such a cofactor was sought by combining NSP with homogenates of mouse hippocampus to allow for interaction between NSP and a potential cofactor, followed by the addition of t-PA. There was no evidence of improved efficiency of t-PA inhibition or of stabilization of t-PA·NSP complexes (data not shown). The data presented above raise intriguing questions about the nature of the physiologic interaction between t-PA and NSP. In processes involving other protease-serpin pairs, the acyl-enzyme complex presents molecular determinants not present on the individual reactants that allow cellular internalization of the complex, classically via the LDL receptor-related protein molecule (17Higazi A.A. Upson R.H. Cohen R.L. Manuppello J. Bognacki J. Henkin J. McCrae K.R. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. Preissner K.T. Lawler J. Cines D.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 542-551Google Scholar). The time required for complex internalization in in vitroexperiments (34Zhang J.-C. Sakthivel R. Kniss D. Grahm C.H. Strickland D.K. McCrae K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32273-32280Google Scholar) suggests that this process may not be rapid enough to clear t-PA·NSP complexes before deacylation at 37 °C. Hence, it will be of interest to determine whether t-PA·NSP acyl-enzyme complexes have a different fate than do other protease-serpin pairs. Alternatively, given that sct-PA·NSP complexes are longer lived than tct-PA·NSP complexes, NSP may serve to selectively inactivate or mediate clearance of sct-PA. At present, however, these remain speculations to be tested experimentally. Given that stable acyl-enzyme complexes are characteristic of cognate protease-serpin pairs, with relatively unstable complexes being observed in some noncognate pairs (35Plotnick M.I. Sandkur M. Wang Z.M. Liu X. Rubin H. Schechter N.M. Selwood T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 334-342Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to examine whether NSP is indeed a physiologic inhibitor of t-PA. Relating the data in statement (i) that families with a point mutation of NSP, resulting in in situ polymerization of NSP and presumably a decrease in soluble NSP, manifest their first clinical signs of disease as spontaneous seizures (36Takao M. Benson M. Murrell J. Yazaki M. Piccardo P. Unverzagt F. Davis R. Holohon P. Laurence D. Richardson R. Fralow M. Ghetti B. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 1070-1086Google Scholar), and the data in statement (ii) rodent models demonstrate t-PA-dependent propagation of seizures that is blocked by NSP (37Yepes M. Sandkust M. Coleman T.A. Moore E. Wu J.Y. Mitola D. Bugge T.H. Lawrence D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1571-1578Google Scholar), it seems likely that a t-PA-NSP interaction takes place in vivo as a part of seizure-prevention processes. It will therefore be important to reconcile the observed biochemical characteristics of NSP with observations on its in vivo actions.

https://openalex.org/W1998878958,"Recently, our laboratory reported an intricate regulation of the human reduced folate carrier (hRFC) gene, involving multiple promoters and noncoding exons. We localized promoter activity to a 452-bp GC-rich region upstream of noncoding exon A, including a 47-bp basal promoter with a CRE/AP-1-like consensus element that bound the bZip family of DNA-binding proteins (<i>e.g.</i>CREB-1 and c-Jun). We now report that three nearly identical tandem repeats (49–61 bp) in the hRFC-A upstream region are involved in regulating promoter activity. By <i>in vitro</i> binding assays, multiple transcription factors (<i>e.g.</i> AP2 and Sp1/Sp3) bound this region. When AP2 was cotransfected with the hRFC-A reporter construct into HT1080 cells, promoter activity increased 3-fold. In <i>Drosophila</i> SL2 cells, Sp1 transactivated promoter A and showed synergism with CREB-1. However, c-Jun was antagonistic to the effects of Sp1. A sequence variant in the hRFC-A repeated region was identified, involving an exact duplication of a 61-bp sequence. This variant had an allelic frequency of 78% in 72 genomic DNAs and resulted in a 63% increase in promoter activity. These results identify important regions in the hRFC-A promoter and critical roles for AP2 and Sp1, in combination with the bZip transcription factors. Moreover, they document a functionally novel polymorphism that increases promoter activity and may contribute to interpatient variations in hRFC expression and effects on tissue folate homeostasis and antitumor response to antifolates."

Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These loci have recombination signal sequences (RSSs) 1The abbreviations used for: RSS, recombination signal sequence; RAG, recombination-activating gene; DSB, DNA double strand break; T-ALL, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; STS, sequence-tagged site. 1The abbreviations used for: RSS, recombination signal sequence; RAG, recombination-activating gene; DSB, DNA double strand break; T-ALL, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; STS, sequence-tagged site.consisting of a highly conserved heptamer sequence (consensus 5′-CACAGTG) and an AT-rich nonamer sequence (consensus 5′-ACAAAAACC). The recombination-activating gene (RAG) complex generates DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) at pairs of RSSs in which one signal has a 12-bp spacer between the heptamer and nonamer (12-signal) and the other signal has a 23-bp spacer (23-signal) (1Lewis S.M.

Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). This is known as the 12/23 rule. Several nucleotides are inserted as junctional additions at the junctions, and the broken DNA ends are rejoined by the nonhomologous end joining pathway (1Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev.

The results of V(D)J recombination are that coding junction products and, in some cases such as the Ig κ locus, signal junction products are left in the human genomic DNA (1Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that recurrent chromosomal aberrations in lymphoid malignancies, such as translocations and inversions involving the Ig and T cell receptor loci, are caused by illegitimate actions of the V(D)J recombination machinery at “ectopic” RSSs, the sequences homologous to the consensus RSS at non-Ig, non-T cell receptor loci (4Croce C.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5Korsmeyer S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 785-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Rabbitts T.H.

These chromosomal aberrations cause the activation or fusion of several oncogenes leading to leukemogenesis. In a large portion of these aberrations, insertions of nucleotides were detected between the two joined germ line sequences. In addition, recently, several DNA fragments containing the ectopic RSSs were shown to have potential to undergo V(D)J recombinationin vivo (10Lewis S.M. Agard E. Suh S. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Raghavan S.C. Kirsch I.R. Lieber M.R. J. Biol.

Med. 2002; 195: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, it was indicated that illegitimate V(D)J recombination is a major cause for the occurrence of these chromosomal aberrations.Deletion of the chromosome 9p21 region is a crucial event for the development of lymphoid leukemia irrespective of lineages, since homozygous deletions of this region have been found in 20–50% of lymphoid leukemia both of T- and B-lineages (13Ohnishi H. Kawamura M. Ida K. Sheng X.M. Hanada R. Nobori T. Yamamori S. Hayashi Y. Blood. 1995; 86: 1269-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Drexler H.G. Leukemia. 1998; 12: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The chromosome 9p21 segment contains the 40-kb region encoding thep16/CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene and two other related genes, p14/ARF andp15/CDKN2B, all of which encode critical factors for the regulation of cell cycle and/or apoptosis (15Kohno T. Yokota J. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 16Sherr C.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3689-3695PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, Cayuela et al. (17Cayuela J.M. Gardie B. Sigaux F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3720-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) characterized three sites of breakpoint clustering in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) in the 40-kb region. The three sites consisted of a major breakpoint cluster site, MTS1bcrβ, and two minor sites, MTS1bcrα and MTS2bcr1 (see Fig. 1 A). All three sites contained heptamer-RSS-like sequences; therefore, it was suggested that illegitimate V(D)J recombination is involved in the occurrence of 9p21 deletions in T-ALL. However, in that study, structures of only a small number of breakpoint-containing regions in leukemia cells only of T-lineage were analyzed. In addition, the involvement of V(D)J recombination was suggested only by the sequences of breakpoints and was not functionally assessed. Therefore, it still remains largely obscure whether illegitimate V(D)J recombination is a major cause for 9p21 deletions in lymphoid leukemia.In the present study, 30 breakpoints for 9p21 deletions were cloned in 15 human lymphoid leukemia cell lines consisting of nine T- and six B-lineage lines. The breakpoints were distributed at 18 different sites in the 9p21 segment. Seventeen (57%) of the breakpoints were mapped at five breakpoint cluster sites, BCS-LL1 to LL5, each of <15-bp. One of the breakpoint cluster sites, BCS-LL2, was the same as MTS1bcrβ (17Cayuela J.M. Gardie B. Sigaux F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3720-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the remaining four sites were novel. Two breakpoint clustering sites were located within the 40-kb region encoding the CDKN2A, ARF, and CDKN2Bgenes, whereas the remaining three were located >100 kb apart from the 40-kb region. Thus, the results further supported the previous finding of breakpoint clustering for 9p21 deletions in lymphoid leukemia. All five BCS-LLs and seven other breakpoint sites contained the CAC trinucleotide, which is identical to the first three nucleotides of heptamer-RSSs indispensable for V(D)J recombination. The sequences of breakpoint junctions indicated that deletions in the majority (11 lines, 73%) of the cell lines were mediated by illegitimate V(D)J recombination preferentially targeted at BCS-LLs, and such a recombination occurred in both the T- and B-lineage cell lines. Thus, we further performed an extrachromosomal V(D)J recombination assay to functionally assess the V(D)J recombination potential of BCS-LLs. All of the four BCS-LL fragments tested were shown to have the potential to undergo V(D)J recombination as RSSs, whereas the efficiency and specificity of the potential were different among the fragments. The present results strongly indicated that illegitimate V(D)J recombination, which was targeted at RSS-like sequences widely distributed in the 9p21 segment, causes a major (>70%) fraction of 9p21 deletions in lymphoid leukemia of both T- and B-lineages. There was no evidence of V(D)J recombination at the breakpoint junctions of the remaining four (27%) cell lines, raising the possibility that 9p21 deletions in a small subset of lymphoid leukemia were caused by mechanisms other than illegitimate V(D)J recombination.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, the distribution of 33 breakpoints for 9p21 deletions in 21 lymphoid leukemia were examined in the 240-kb segment covering the 40-kb region containing the CDKN2A,ARF, and CDKN2B loci, the region where the breakpoint distribution was previously examined in T-ALL (17Cayuela J.M. Gardie B. Sigaux F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3720-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This breakpoint mapping and the subsequent breakpoint cloning enabled us to identify three breakpoint cluster sites, BCS-LL1 to LL3. These three sites contained four or five breakpoints; thus, they were considered as major breakpoint cluster sites (Fig. 2, A and B). BCS-LL2 was the same as MTS1bcrβ in the ARF locus, where the significant portion (>60%) of the breakpoints in T-ALL had been previously mapped; therefore, the result of Cayuela et al.(17Cayuela J.M. Gardie B. Sigaux F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3720-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was confirmed. In the present study, an additional major breakpoint cluster site, BCS-LL3, was identified in theCDKN2B locus, and another site, BCS-LL1, was identified in the MTAP locus of >100 kb distal to the CDKN2A,ARF, and CDKN2B loci (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, two additional breakpoint cluster sites, BCS-LL4 and -LL5, were also identified at loci >100 kb distal to these loci (Fig.2 A). Since two or three breakpoints among those identified by us or Cayuela et al. (17Cayuela J.M. Gardie B. Sigaux F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3720-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were located at these sites, they were considered as being minor breakpoint cluster sites. Cayuelaet al. (17Cayuela J.M. Gardie B. Sigaux F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3720-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also identified two minor breakpoint cluster sites, MTS1bcrα and MTS2bcr1, in the vicinity of theCDKN2A and CDKN2B loci, respectively (Fig.2 A). However, none of the breakpoints in this study were mapped at these two sites. Therefore, they are likely to be minor cluster sites as previously reported (17Cayuela J.M. Gardie B. Sigaux F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3720-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the present result further supported the previous finding that breakpoints for 9p21 deletions in lymphoid leukemia are clustered. In addition, it was found that both the breakpoints of T- and B-lineage cell lines were located at the BCS-LL sites. Thus, the present result also indicates that the breakpoint cluster sites are susceptible to DNA breaks during lymphoid leukemogenesis irrespective of cell lineages.All BCS-LLs contained the CAC trinucleotide, which is identical to the first three nucleotides of heptamer-RSSs indispensable for V(D)J recombination. In addition, 7 of the 13 sites, where a single breakpoint was mapped in this study, also contained the CAC trinucleotide within 23 bp of each breakpoint. Therefore, in total, 12 (67%) of the 18 sites contained the CAC trinucleotide (Fig. 1). Since the probability of finding CAC in the genome is 1 in 64 bp (¼ × ¼ × ¼ = 1/64), 18 sites of 23-bp, each of which contains 21 trinucleotides, could contain six copies of CAC (18 × 21 × 1/64 = 5.9). Therefore, the CAC trinucleotide was overrepresented at the breakpoints. Breakpoint junctions in 11 (73.3%) cell lines consisting of seven T- and four B-lineage lines showed typical evidence of V(D)J recombination (Fig.3 A). The CAC trinucleotide, which flanked both the distal and proximal breakpoints, was deleted with the segment encoding theCDKN2A, ARF, and CDKN2B genes, and nucleotides of 1–10 bp were inserted at the breakpoint junctions. The deletions in these cases were typical of coding junctions of V(D)J recombination. DSBs generated by the RAG complex are processed to the P-nucleotide and/or N-nucleotide additions in the case of coding junctions (1Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three of the 22 breakpoints in these 11 cases, distal ones of L-SMY and CCRF-CEM and a proximal one of KOPT-K1, were located next to the CAC trinucleotide, respectively, and one or two nucleotides complementary to the germ line sequences upstream of the CAC trinucleotide were inserted at the junctions (underlined in Fig. 3 A). These nucleotides are likely to be P-nucleotides. The remaining 19 breakpoints were located 1–15 bp away from the heptamer-RSS-like sequences; therefore, inserted N-nucleotides (rather than P-nucleotides) probably account for nucleotide sequences beside those breakpoints. Thus, overrepresentation of CAC in the vicinity of breakpoints as well as the sequences of the breakpoint junctions indicated that the majority (>70%) of 9p21 deletions in lymphoid leukemia of both T- and B-lineages are caused by illegitimate V(D)J recombination.In the remaining four (27%) cell lines, V(D)J recombination was not evident at the breakpoint junctions (Fig. 3 B). In two T-lineage cell lines, P12/Ichikawa and KAWAI, only proximal breakpoints were flanked by the CAC trinucleotide, and nucleotides were not inserted at the junctions. In two B-lineage cell lines, HPB-NULL and THP-7, breakpoints were not flanked by the CAC trinucleotide. Therefore, it was likely that deletions in these cell lines were generated by mechanisms other than illegitimate V(D)J recombination. Joining of nonhomologous DNA without evidence of V(D)J recombination has been detected at the breakpoint junctions for the interstitial deletions in nonhematological malignancies, including 9p21 deletions in two cases of glioma (30Canning S. Dryja T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5044-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 31Pomykala H.M. Bohlander S.K. Broeker P.L. Olopade O.I. Diaz M.O. Mol. Cell.

Oncogene. 2001; 19: 6251-6260Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, as hypothesized in nonhematological malignancies (3Lieber M.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1323-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 34Chen C. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 81-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jasin M. Cancer Invest. 2000; 18: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), 9p21 deletions in a subset of lymphoid leukemias, such as these four cell lines, may have also been generated by nonhomologous end joining of DSBs caused by unknown mechanisms. Meanwhile, the proximal breakpoint of P12/Ichikawa was located at BCS-LL2. Therefore, it might be that the DSB at the proximal breakpoint in this cell line was generated by the illegitimate action of the RAG complex. The broken DNA ends generated by the RAG complex may have rejoined with other broken ends generated by other mechanisms.Notably, in 10 of the 11 cell lines whose 9p21 deletions were possibly caused by illegitimate V(D)J recombination, one or both of the proximal and distal breakpoints were located at BCS-LLs. However, the RSS-like sequences, even those at BCS-LLs, showed only a partial homology to the consensus RSSs (Fig. 2 B, Table I). Thus, we assessed the V(D)J recombination potential of DNA fragments containing the RSS-like sequences. We subjected four BCS-LL fragments, BCS-LL1, -LL2, -LL3, and -LL5, to the extrachromosomal V(D)J recombination assay in Reh cells with V(D)J recombination activity (29Gauss G.H. Domain I. Hsieh C.L. Lieber M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The BCS-LL3 fragment positioned as a 12-signal (i.e. pLL3-RSS) showed the highest recombination frequency (Table II), indicating that this fragment had the highest recombination potential among the four fragments tested. This result was consistent with the fact that the largest portions (i.e. five breakpoints) of the breakpoints were clustered at BCS-LL3 (Fig. 2 A). Other cluster sites, BCS-LL1 and BCS-LL5, that were located >100-kb apart from the CDKN2A,ARF, and CDKN2B loci, were also shown to undergo V(D)J recombination as RSSs, respectively. It was inferred that BCS-LL2 has a V(D)J recombination potential both as 12- and 23-signals, but its potential, especially as a 23-signal, was considerably lower than other BCS-LL fragments. This result was contrary to the fact that a considerable number of breakpoints were clustered at the BCS-LL2 site in this (Fig. 2 B) and a previous studies (17Cayuela J.M. Gardie B. Sigaux F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3720-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BCS-LL2 is located in a CA/GT tract, and this tract was not cloned into the pLL2-RSS and pRSS-LL2 plasmids (Table I). CA/GT tracts are speculated to adopt the Z-DNA structure (17Cayuela J.M. Gardie B. Sigaux F. Blood. 1997; 90: 3720-3726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which might enhance V(D)J recombination; thus, the recombination potential of BCS-LL2 could be enhanced by the CA/GT tract.In the present study, all four BCS-LL fragments tested showed potential as RSSs, although the efficiency and specificity as RSS were different among the fragments. Especially, the estimated V(D)J recombination potential of BCS-LL1 and -LL3, two major cluster sites, were similar to that of other ectopic RSSs, which have been predicted to pair with physiological RSSs to give rise to recurrent translocations in lymphoid leukemia (11Raghavan S.C. Kirsch I.R. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29126-29133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the 9p21 deletions analyzed in this study, the BCS-LL3 site was joined with the BCS-LL1 site, but not with the BCS-LL5 site, to give rise to deletions (Fig. 3 A). This is consistent with the fact that the BCS-LL3 and BCS-LL5 sites preferentially acted as 12-signals, whereas the BCS-LL1 site acted as a 23-signal. The BCS-LL5 site with a 12-signal potential was joined with the BCS-LL2 site, for which a weak potential as a 23-signal was suggested (Fig. 3 A). Thus, it is likely that the occurrence of 9p21 deletions conformed to the 12/23 rule (1Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). V(D)J recombination by pairing of two ectopic RSSs, BCS-LL1 and BCS-LL3, was not recapitulated in the extrachromosomal recombination assay; however, this was conceivable, since its predicted recombination frequency was too low to be detected by this system (11Raghavan S.C. Kirsch I.R. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29126-29133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, the present results strongly support the fact that illegitimate V(D)J recombination, targeted at ectopic RSSs in 9p21, causes a large fraction of 9p21 deletions in lymphoid leukemia.The majority of the breakpoints were clustered at BCS-LLs despite the fact that the 9p21 segment analyzed in this study contained thousands of CAC trinucleotides. Thus, it is possible that BCS-LLs have specific structures enhancing V(D)J recombination other than the CAC trinucleotide. It is noted that BCS-LL1, -LL3, and -LL5 specifically functioned as a 12- or 23-signal contrary to the fact that they have no obvious nonamer-RSS-like sequences (Table I). In addition, the recombination potential of BCS-LLs was not correlated to the degrees of their homologies with the consensus RSSs. These results indicate that BCS-LL fragments can take specific configurations as RSSs, irrespective of their homologies with the consensus RSSs. In addition, it is also noted that all of the five BCS-LLs were located in, or upstream of, the genes in this region (Fig. 2 A). The MTAP andCDKN2A genes are expressed ubiquitously in a variety of human tissues, including hematopoietic progenitor cells (20Nobori T. Takabayashi K. Tran P. Orvis L. Batova A. Yu A.L. Carson D.A.

Recent studies have indicated that the open chromatin structure associated with gene expression is a critical factor determining the efficiency of V(D)J recombination, probably changing the accessibility of the V(D)J recombination machinery (38Cherry S.R. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10788-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Kwon J. Morshead K.B. Guyon J.R. Kingston R.E. Oettinger M.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1037-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, the local chromatin structure of BCS-LLs might further enhance the susceptibility to illegitimate V(D)J recombination. Illegitimate V(D)J recombination has been indicated as being involved in a variety of chromosomal aberrations in lymphoid leukemias (8Vanasse G.J. Concannon P. Willerford D.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 3997-4010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Davila M. Foster S. Kelsoe G. Yang K. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 81: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, only a few candidate ectopic RSSs have been functionally assessed for their potential as RSSs (10Lewis S.M. Agard E. Suh S. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Raghavan S.C. Kirsch I.R. Lieber M.R. J. Biol.

Med. 2002; 195: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, genomic structures underlying illegitimate V(D)J recombination should be further investigated to define the mechanisms underlying 9p21 deletions and other recurrent chromosomal aberrations that occur in lymphoid leukemogenesis. V(D)J recombination is a physiological recombination of DNAs, which occurs at the Ig and T cell receptor loci during the differentiation of lymphoid cells (1Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). These loci have recombination signal sequences (RSSs) 1The abbreviations used for: RSS, recombination signal sequence; RAG, recombination-activating gene; DSB, DNA double strand break; T-ALL, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; STS, sequence-tagged site. 1The abbreviations used for: RSS, recombination signal sequence; RAG, recombination-activating gene; DSB, DNA double strand break; T-ALL, T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; STS, sequence-tagged site.consisting of a highly conserved heptamer sequence (consensus 5′-CACAGTG) and an AT-rich nonamer sequence (consensus 5′-ACAAAAACC). The recombination-activating gene (RAG) complex generates DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) at pairs of RSSs in which one signal has a 12-bp spacer between the heptamer and nonamer (12-signal) and the other signal has a 23-bp spacer (23-signal) (1Lewis S.M.

Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). This is known as the 12/23 rule. Several nucleotides are inserted as junctional additions at the junctions, and the broken DNA ends are rejoined by the nonhomologous end joining pathway (1Lewis S.M. Adv.

The results of V(D)J recombination are that coding junction products and, in some cases such as the Ig κ locus, signal junction products are left in the human genomic DNA (1Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that recurrent chromosomal aberrations in lymphoid malignancies, such as translocations and inversions involving the Ig and T cell receptor loci, are caused by illegitimate actions of the V(D)J recombination machinery at “ectopic” RSSs, the sequences homologous to the consensus RSS at non-Ig, non-T cell receptor loci (4Croce C.M.

These chromosomal aberrations cause the activation or fusion of several oncogenes leading to leukemogenesis. In a large portion of these aberrations, insertions of nucleotides were detected between the two joined germ line sequences. In addition, recently, several DNA fragments containing the ectopic RSSs were shown to have potential to undergo V(D)J recombinationin vivo (10Lewis S.M. Agard E. Suh S. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Raghavan S.C. Kirsch I.R. Lieber M.R. J. Biol.

Deletion of the chromosome 9p21 region is a crucial event for the development of lymphoid leukemia irrespective of lineages, since homozygous deletions of this region have been found in 20–50% of lymphoid leukemia both of T- and B-lineages (13Ohnishi H.

Leukemia. 1998; 12: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The chromosome 9p21 segment contains the 40-kb region encoding thep16/CDKN2A tumor suppressor gene and two other related genes, p14/ARF andp15/CDKN2B, all of which encode critical factors for the regulation of cell cycle and/or apoptosis (15Kohno T.

https://openalex.org/W1989041138,"We sought to characterize the role of upstream kinases in the regulation of the MAP3 kinase MEKK1 and the potential impact on signaling to MAP kinase cascades. We find that the MAP4 kinase PAK1 phosphorylates the amino terminus of MEKK1 on serine 67. We show that serine 67 lies in a D domain, which binds to the c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK). Serine 67 is constitutively phosphorylated in resting 293 cells, but is dephosphorylated following exposure to stress stimuli such as anisomycin and UV irradiation. Phosphorylation of this site inhibits binding of JNK/SAPK to MEKK1. Thus, we propose a mechanism by which the MEKK1-dependent JNK/SAPK pathway is negatively regulated by PAK through phosphorylation of serine 67.

The prototypical MAP kinase pathway controls the pheromone-induced mating response of budding yeast. Genes whose loss of function prevented mating were termed sterile (Ste) genes (2Elion E.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by these genes include protein kinases forming a MAP kinase cascade; Ste20p (MAP4 kinase), Ste11p (MAP3 kinase), and Ste7p (MAP2 kinase) work in series to phosphorylate and activate the MAP kinases Kss1p and Fus3p. The kinases are assembled on the scaffold Ste5p and its associated molecules. Ten years ago, purification of the MAP kinase ERK1 and the MAP2 kinase known as MEK1 or MKK1 led to the isolation of their cDNAs, revealing that mammalian cells contained homologous cascades. At that time a search began for mammalian counterparts of the more upstream components of the cascade, using the sequences of the yeast proteins. The first of these efforts led to the isolation of the Ste11p homolog MEKK1 (3Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Subsequently the p21-activated kinases (PAKs) were recognized as Ste20p homologs, and a plethora of other Ste11p and Ste20p homologs were identified (4Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.-S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 5Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet.

More than a dozen MAP kinases have now been found in metazoans, most known to be regulated by similar kinase cascades (1Chen Z. Gibson T.B. Robinson F. Silvestro L. Pearson G. Xu Be B.E. Wright A. Vanderbilt C. Cobb M.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2449-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) MAP kinase pathway participates in many stress responses, such as those induced by hypoxia, cold shock, and hyperosmolarity (6Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 8Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). There are three genes encoding JNK/SAPKs in mammals; many JNK/SAPK protein species are generated through alternate splicing. The MAP2 kinases in the JNK/SAPK cascade are MKK4 and MKK7 (also known as MEK4 and MEK7). Several MAP3 kinases have been implicated in regulating this cascade including MEKK1, MLK2, ASK1, and TAK1 (5Fanger G.R. Gerwins P. Widmann C. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 6Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 8Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). The relationship between these MAP3 kinases and cellular stimuli that activate JNK/SAPK remain vague. MEKK1 binds directly to JNK/SAPK, suggesting that it is a significant regulator of the pathway (9Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, gene disruption experiments indicate that MEKK1 is not important for hormonal regulation of JNK/SAPK, although it may mediate JNK/SAPK activation by agents that signal through the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton or through chemical stresses (11Xia Y.

MEKK1 is regulated by the MAP4 kinases Nck-interacting kinase (Nck) and germinal center kinase (GCK), as well as the scaffolding protein Traf2, primarily through interactions with its amino terminus (16Su Y.-C.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). As noted above, JNK/SAPK binds to MEKK1 through a motif located in its amino terminus (9Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, we proposed that MEKK1 can act as the scaffold of its own MAP kinase signaling module in a manner reminiscent of Ste5p of the yeast pheromone-signaling pathway (24Karandikar M. Cobb M.H. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The PAKs are activated by their association with Cdc42 and Rac1, which relieve the negative regulation mediated by the autoinhibitory domain (25Frost J.A. Khokhlatchev A. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28253-28260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 26Zhao Z.-S. Manser E. Chen Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PAKs positively regulate the ERK MAP kinase pathway through effects on at least two substrates. PAK phosphorylates Raf-1 on serine 338 (27King A.J. Sun H. Diaz B. Barnard D. Miao W. Bagrodia S. Marshall M.S. Nature. 1998; 396: 180-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 28Chaudhary A.

Steen H. Shapiro P.S. Lewis R. Ahn J. Shaw P.E. Cobb M.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6426-6438Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, some initial experiments showed that PAK1 could regulate the JNK/SAPK MAP kinase cascade (30Bagrodia S. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27995-27998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 31Polverino A. Frost J. Yang P. Hutchison M. Neiman A.M. Cobb M.H. Marcus S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26067-26070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This observation combined with the finding that MEKK1 also regulated the JNK/SAPK pathway suggested that PAK might be the MAP4 kinase directly regulating MEKK1. We have attempted to define the relationship between PAK and control of MEKK1 function. We found that PAK1 phosphorylated MEKK1 on serine 67 of its amino-terminal regulatory domain. This residue is located within the JNK/SAPK-binding site of MEKK1. Phosphorylation of serine 67 inhibits JNK/SAPK binding to MEKK1. This site is phosphorylated in cells; its phosphorylation state is regulated. Thus, we propose a novel regulatory mechanism in which PAKs regulate the ability of MEKK1 to scaffold JNK/SAPK. 293 cells were cultured and transfected with calcium phosphate as described previously (9Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The following agents were used to stimulate cells: UV radiation (2 min at 1 J/s/m2), 80 ng/ml EGF (Sigma), 20 ng/ml TNF-α (Sigma), 20 ng/ml IL-1β (R & D Systems), or 10 μg/ml anisomycin (Fluka). The following constructs were utilized in this study: pRSET MEKK1-(1–482), pGEX KG MEKK1-(30–220), pGEX KG MEKK1-(149–347), pGEX KG MEKK1-(310–636), pGEX KG MEKK1-(630–772), pGEX KG MEKK1-(149–636), pGEX KG PAK1-(232–544), pCMV5 PAK1 L107F, pRSET SAPKαI ((kindly provided by John Kyriakis) refers to rat sequence, the human equivalent is JNK2), and pGEX KG SAPKαI. Peptides utilized include A (58RRQQLRKVRSVELDQLPEQP77), mA (58RRQQLRKVRSAEADQLPEQP77), and phospho-A (pA) (58RRQQLRKVRpSVELDQLPEQP77). These were synthesized at the Biopolymers Facility, Howard Hughes Medical Institute (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed at the Howard Hughes Institute (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) using standard protocols. Peptides were coupled to Sepharose beads, and binding assays were performed as described previously (9Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). His-tagged interaction assays were performed as described (32Drewett V. Muller S. Goodall J. Shaw P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1757-1762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Beads were washed with wash buffer (250 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). Proteins bound to beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and Western analysis was performed using anti-JNK1 (Santa Cruz: sc-571, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-His6 (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The A and pA peptides were used to generate antibodies. Peptides were coupled to Limulushemocyanin (Sigma) and polyclonal antisera derived as described previously (33Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). 293 cells were lysed, and endogenous MEKK1, or Myc-tagged constructs, were immunoprecipitated as described previously (14Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40120-40127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The protein A beads were boiled in sample buffer, and eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used: anti-MEKK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1–9c-2a), anti-MEKK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-22), anti-JNK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-571) and anti-Myc (9E10, National Cell Culture Center). Briefly, kinase assays were performed in kinase assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 μm ATP (5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per reaction), 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate) for the indicated time at 30 °C (33Xu S.

Incorporation of radioactive phosphate was detected by autoradiography and liquid scintillation counting of excised bands. We wanted to determine whether PAK1 regulates the function of MEKK1 by phosphorylation. Thus, we utilized an active, kinase domain fragment of PAK1-(232–544) and recombinant fragments of MEKK1 expressed in bacteria as substrates (Fig.1 A). In a kinase assay PAK1-(232–544) phosphorylated a fragment of MEKK1 comprising residues 30–220 (Fig. 1 B), but did not phosphorylate fragments derived from more COOH-terminal sequence. Following phosphorylation by PAK1, the mass of MEKK1 fragment residues 30–220, measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, increased by 82 Da, a mass equivalent within experimental error to the addition of a single phosphoryl group (80 Da). The fragment was digested with trypsin and V8 protease, and the peptides were subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Serine 67 was identified as the phosphorylation site (Fig. 2,A–D). The location of serine 67 is notable for the fact that it occurs within the JNK/SAPK-binding domain (TableI and Fig. 5) (9Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Figure 2PAK1 phosphorylates serine 67 of MEKK1.MEKK1-(30–220) was either not phosphorylated (A) or phosphorylated by PAK1 (B) and then digested with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The peptide residues 67–119 gave a measured increase in mass of 82 Da, consistent with the presence of one phosphoryl group (80 Da).C, following tryptic digestion of the phosphorylated fragment, the phosphopeptide residues 67–119 were treated with alkaline phosphatase. The arrow indicates the loss of mass equivalent to a single phosphoryl group from the peptide. D, mass changes of peptides from MEKK1-(30–220) digested with trypsin or V8 protease.

Peptide A, which spans the region of MEKK1 phosphorylated by PAK, was synthesized in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms. The phosphorylated peptide A was used as antigen to generate a polyclonal antibody that recognizes this site. The anti-phosphoserine 67 pA antibody was further purified by its affinity for phosphorylated, and lack of interaction with non-phosphorylated peptide, to enhance specificity for the phosphopeptide. Following phosphorylation by PAK1, MEKK1-(30–220) was specifically recognized by immunoblotting with the pA antibody, and this signal could be blocked by a phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 3 Aand data not shown). MEKK1-(30–220) was incubated with PAK1 over a 90-min time course. The stoichiometry of serine 67 phosphorylation was greater than 0.9 mol of phosphate/mol of MEKK1-(30–220). Recombinant active PAK1 (L107F) expressed in mammalian cells also phosphorylated MEKK1 (data not shown). Kinase assays and immunoblotting with the pA antibody demonstrated that the appearance of immunoreactivity toward phosphorylated serine 67 of MEKK1 correlated with the phosphorylation of the substrate (Fig. 3 A). A similar result was noted with MEKK1-(1–482) as PAK1 substrate (Fig. 3 B). To validate further the selectivity of the pA antibody for MEKK1 phosphorylated on serine 67, we examined the effect of dephosphorylation of serine 67 on recognition of MEKK1 by anti-pA. Recombinant full-length MEKK1 purified from Sf9 cells is characteristically multiply phosphorylated and highly active. Therefore, we tested whether it is phosphorylated on residue serine 67 and if this site can be dephosphorylated by treatment with phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Fig. 3 C). MEKK1 was phosphorylated on serine 67 as revealed by its immunoreactivity with anti-pA. Treatment of MEKK1 with PP2A resulted in the loss of immunoreactivity with anti-pA, supporting the specificity of the pA antibody only for forms of MEKK1 phosphorylated on serine 67. Anin vitro kinase reaction was performed to compare the activity of other protein kinases toward MEKK1 serine 67. Protein kinase A (PKA), SAPKαI, the catalytic fragment of MEKK1, and PAK1-(232–544) were used in kinase assays with MEKK1-(1–482) as a substrate (Fig. 3 D). Immunoblotting with anti-pA indicated that only PAK1 caused significant phosphorylation of this site. The phosphorylation of MEKK1 on serine 67 in cells and the ability of stimuli to modulate this phosphorylation were examined by immunoblotting lysates of 293 cells with anti-pA. MEKK1 from cells grown in serum-containing medium was phosphorylated on serine 67 (Fig. 4 A). A 60-min treatment with either anisomycin or UV irradiation caused the dephosphorylation of serine 67 relative to the untreated control. By contrast, treatment with TNF-α, IL-1, and EGF failed to alter serine 67 phosphorylation relative to control. The dephosphorylation of serine 67 in response to UV or anisomycin treatment correlates with increased JNK/SAPK activity (Fig. 4 B). Exposure of 293 cells to anisomycin or UV caused ∼50- and 20-fold stimulations of JNK/SAPK activity, respectively, while the combination of TNF-α, IL-1, and EGF activated JNK/SAPK in these cells only 3-fold. PAK activity measured in immune complexes from cells treated with these agents increased modestly in response to all of the agents tested (Fig. 4 C), suggesting no apparent relationship between PAK activation and phosphorylation of MEKK1 on serine 67. Using peptide binding assays, we previously determined that MEKK1 binds to JNK/SAPK via a 15-residue region (9Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). By sequence alignment we noted that this peptide resembles a MAP kinase docking motif termed D domain (Table I) (34Yang S.H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 35Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This motif is comprised of clusters of basic and hydrophobic residues. We found that the hydrophobic residues of the MAP kinase docking site in MEK1 and MEK3b were of primary importance for the interaction between MAP kinases and their substrates (36Xu B. Stippec S. Robinson F.L. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26509-26515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 37Chang C.I. Xu B. Akella R. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To support our expectation that this region of MEKK1 behaved like a D domain, we tested whether the hydrophobic residues are important in the interaction between SAPKαI and MEKK1, using an MEKK1 wild type and mutant peptide bound to Sepharose beads. Supporting this hypothesis, mutation of the two hydrophobic residues alone significantly reduced the interaction between SAPKαI and the MEKK1 D domain peptide (Fig. 5). The peptide binding assay was used to characterize the effect of phosphorylation of serine 67 on the ability of the MEKK1 D domain to bind SAPKαI. As above, peptide A bound SAPKαI significantly in this assay, if either 50 or 100 nmSAPKαI was incubated with the peptide beads (Fig.6 A and data not shown). Binding was weakly detected even at 10 nm input SAPKαI. The ability of peptide A to bind SAPKαI was comparable with SAPKαI binding to a peptide that contained the MKK4 D domain (data not shown). However, pA bound SAPKαI much less well, most likely due to the steric or charge effects of introducing a phosphate group in the middle of the D domain. To confirm that phosphorylation of serine 67 reduced the capacity of MEKK1 to bind to JNK/SAPK, we examined binding of 50 nmSAPKαI to His6-MEKK1-(1–482) in which serine 67 was either unphosphorylated or phosphorylated by PAK1 (Fig. 6 B). The SAPKαI·MEKK1 complexes were harvested by binding His6-MEKK1-(1–482) to nickel-agarose beads. Western analysis of proteins on the collected beads revealed much less SAPKαI associated with phosphorylated MEKK 1–482. This finding supports the conclusion that phosphorylation of MEKK1 by PAK1 significantly impairs JNK/SAPK binding. The relevance of serine 67 to MEKK1 function and JNK/SAPK signaling was tested by comparing the abilities of peptides A and pA coupled to Sepharose beads to bind JNK/SAPK from 293 cells untreated or exposed to UV light (Fig. 7 A). No JNK/SAPK was associated with empty beads. Both 46- and 54-kDa isoforms of JNK/SAPK were associated with peptide A beads; stimulation with UV light neither increased nor decreased JNK/SAPK binding, as reported previously (9Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, no JNK/SAPK immunoreactivity could be detected with pA beads. The activity of the JNK/SAPK associated with the peptides was tested utilizing an in vitro kinase assay with c-Jun as substrate. Consistent with the immunoblotting results, little activity was detected on pA beads, while UV-stimulated Jun phosphorylating activity was associated with A beads. To demonstrate that the interactions detected with peptides bound to beads revealed changes in interactions that occurred with full-length MEKK1, endogenous MEKK1 was immunoprecipitated, and the immunoprecipitates were probed for the presence of JNK/SAPKs (Fig.7 B). Cells were untreated or treated with the combination of TNF-α, IL-1, and EGF, conditions in which phosphorylation of MEKK1 on serine 67 was high (see Fig. 4 A), or with anisomycin or UV irradiation, conditions in which phosphorylation of MEKK1 on serine 67 was low. Relatively little of either the 54- or 46-kDa forms of JNK/SAPKs were associated with MEKK1 under the first two sets of conditions. On the other hand, significant amounts of JNK/SAPK proteins were bound to MEKK1 isolated from cells treated with anisomycin or UV, which promoted MEKK1 dephosphorylation. These findings support the conclusion that phosphorylation of serine 67 inhibits the interaction of MEKK1 with JNK/SAPK isoforms, thereby regulating the linkage between MEKK1 and the JNK/SAPK pathway. MEKK1 activity is low in untreated cells and high in cells stimulated with UV or anisomycin, conditions that promote dephosphorylation of serine 67 (13). These results suggest that phosphorylation of serine 67 does not enhance MEKK1 kinase activity. Nevertheless, we examined the effect of phosphorylation of serine 67 on MEKK1 activity in vitro. Recombinant MEKK1 was phosphorylated by PAK either without or with prior dephosphorylation with PP2A. MEKK1 not treated with PP2A had high basal activity; phosphorylation by PAK caused no change in its ability to phosphorylate the substrate kinase-dead MEK4 (Fig.7 B). However, serine 67 is significantly phosphorylated in this form of MEKK1 (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, MEKK1 was treated with PP2A, which removes phosphate from serine 67 as well as other sites (38Cobb M.H. Xu S. Cheng M. Ebert D. Robbins D. Goldsmith E. Robinson M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 39Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), before phosphorylation by PAK. Treatment with PP2A reduced MEKK1 activity; MEKK1 activity was increased modestly following PAK phosphorylation. D domains are commonly found in MAP kinase binding partners and substrates and are comprised of basic and hydrophobic residues (35Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 448-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). D domains interact with MAP kinases via a hydrophobic binding groove that extends toward the active site from the opposite surface of the kinase and includes an acidic cluster that attracts basic residues of D domains to the groove (37Chang C.I. Xu B. Akella R. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 40Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). The association of MEKs and substrates with MAP kinases is thought to be regulated by the phosphorylation state of the MAP kinase or the substrate in regions outside the D domain or docking groove (41Adachi M. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5347-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 42Hsiao K.-M. Chou S. Shih S.-J. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5480-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We find that phosphorylation of MEKK1 within the D domain regulates the JNK/SAPK binding capability of MEKK1. Pulido and co-workers (43Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 44Blanco-Aparicio C. Torres J. Pulido R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported that the tyrosine phosphatases PTP-SL and STEP were phosphorylated within a D domain, termed a kinase interaction motif, by PKA. Phosphorylation by PKA decreased the association of the phosphatases with ERK2 and p38 MAP kinase. Interestingly, we note the frequent occurrence of serine or threonine residues within D domains of MAP kinase binding partners (Table I), suggesting this is a more common mechanism than currently recognized. The regulation of MEKK1 activity has proved to be complex. Of the numerous binding partners identified, some may induce dis-inhibition of the catalytic domain or promote auto-activation. Indeed, recent work has suggested that oligomerization via Traf2 and GCK facilitates MEKK1 activation, probably by increasing its local concentration (19Chadee D.N. Yuasa T. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The role of phosphorylation in regulating MEKK1 function has been difficult to sort out due in large part to the fact that MEKK1 is highly phosphorylated in its active state and contains numerous potential phosphorylation sites. Recombinant MEKK1 overexpressed in mammalian cells or in Sf9 cells is highly active (33Xu S. Robbins D.J. Christerson L.B. English J.M. Vanderbilt C.A. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Treatment with phosphatase substantially reduces its activity, indicating that phosphorylation state is a significant determinant of its activity (38Cobb M.H. Xu S. Cheng M. Ebert D. Robbins D. Goldsmith E. Robinson M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Two threonine residues that lie within the activation loop of the core MEKK1 catalytic domain have been shown to be phosphorylated and required for kinase activation (39Deak J.C. Templeton D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our in vitro experiments suggest that phosphorylation of serine 67 by PAK1 modestly increases MEKK1 activity. This is the first instance of a PAK-dependent phosphorylation that has an impact on the JNK/SAPK pathway. Nevertheless, we find this site phosphorylated in resting cells and under other conditions in which MEKK1 activity is low, and dephosphorylated under conditions in which MEKK1 is strongly activated. Thus, despite an effect on in vitro activity, our data are most consistent with the conclusion that phosphorylation of serine 67 has little to do with altering MEKK1 activity, but instead regulates its associations. What determines the phosphorylation state of MEKK1 serine 67 is not yet clear. In resting 293 cells MEKK1 is phosphorylated on serine 67. Certain stimuli, including UV irradiation and anisomycin, cause the nearly complete dephosphorylation of this site, while EGF in combination with other agents has little net effect on the phosphorylation state of this site. PAK1 activity is relatively low in resting cells and is stimulated to a small extent by the growth factors and other agents used in this study (see also Ref. 45Roig J. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31119-31122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, there is no apparent correlation between serine 67 phosphorylation and total PAK1 activity in cells. The phosphorylation of this site might be controlled in a manner not reflected by total PAK1 activity, but rather by a small fraction of PAK1 that may be colocalized with MEKK1. It is also possible that other PAK isoforms or other unidentified protein kinases are the major MEKK1 serine 67 kinases. No other potential serine 67 kinases were implicated by analysis of the sequence surrounding serine 67 using the Scansite website (www.scansite.mit.edu) nor did PKA phosphorylate this site. Alternatively, the phosphorylation state of this site may be determined primarily by regulated dephosphorylation. If this is so, PAK may tonically phosphorylate serine 67, which would remain in this state until an appropriate phosphatase is targeted to MEKK1. PP2A can dephosphorylate this site. We previously found that the catalytic subunit of PP2A binds tightly to MEKK1 in vitro; however, the potential physiological significance of this interaction is unknown. 2S. Xu and M. H. Cobb, unpublished data. Perhaps the regulated association of a phosphatase such as PP2A with MEKK1 may determine the extent of phosphorylation of serine 67 at any given time. We propose a model that may account for MEKK1-mediated JNK/SAPK activation based on earlier work and the studies described here. MEKK1 can bind both to MEK4 and JNK/SAPK, forming a complex containing a three-protein kinase signaling cascade. MEK4 binds to the kinase domain of MEKK1 and apparently dissociates from MEKK1 once it is activated. JNK/SAPK binds to the D domain near the NH2 terminus of MEKK1 from approximately residues 62–70 (9Xu S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32056-32060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Xia Y. Wu Z. Su B. Murray B. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3369-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). PAK1 can phosphorylate MEKK1 on serine 67 within its JNK/SAPK-binding D domain. Phosphorylation of MEKK1 on serine 67 alters the state of the D domain, thereby decreasing its affinity for JNK/SAPK. Under these conditions JNK/SAPK is not recruited into the MEKK1 signaling module. MEK4, unlike other MEKs in MAP kinase pathways, is known to have another substrate, the retinoid X receptor (46Lee H.Y. Suh Y. Robinson M.J. Clifford J.L. Hong W.K. Woodgett J.R. Cobb M.H. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kurie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32193-32199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It is possible that MEK4 may preferentially phosphorylate the retinoid X receptor if JNK/SAPK is not associated with MEKK1. Upon dephosphorylation of serine 67, JNK/SAPK will reassociate with the MEKK1 D domain, allowing it to be activated when MEKK1 is activated. In this model the relative state of phosphorylation of serine 67 will control the coupling of MEKK1 to the JNK/SAPK pathway.

The major structural proteins of mammalian hair are the hair keratins and their associated proteins. The hair keratins belong to the large keratin multigene family, which mainly comprises genes that are expressed in various types of epithelia. Hair keratins form the intermediate filament (IF) 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; KAP, hair keratin-associated protein; RT, reverse transcription; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ISH, in situ hybridization; IIF, indirect immunofluorescence; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; KAP, hair keratin-associated protein; RT, reverse transcription; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ISH, in situ hybridization; IIF, indirect immunofluorescence; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.network in trichocytes, i.e. cells that populate the central hair-forming compartment (hair matrix, cortex, and cuticle) of the anagen hair follicle. In the hair cortex, hair keratin IFs are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KAPs), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins (1Powell B.C. Nesci A. Rogers G.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 642: 1-20Google Scholar,2Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 59-148Google Scholar).Originally, KAPs, mostly of ovine origin, have been classified on the basis of their amino acid composition as high sulfur (16–30 mol % cysteine), ultra-high sulfur (>30 mol % cysteine), and high glycine/tyrosine proteins (2Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 59-148Google Scholar). In 1993, Rogers and Powell (3Rogers G.E. Powell B.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: S50-S55Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) introduced a species-independent nomenclature using the abbreviations KAP1.n through KAP8.n for the eight members known at that time with “n” referring to a number identifying individual members fitting into a given family on the basis of sequence homology and the nature of repeat structures often present in these proteins (3Rogers G.E. Powell B.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: S50-S55Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Since then, the number of new KAPs from sheep, rabbit, mouse, and humans have steadily increased (2Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 59-148Google Scholar), and to date, a total of 23 KAP families are known. Of these, families 1–3, 10–16, and 23 represent high sulfur KAPs (2Powell B.C.

Gening L.V. Gazaryan K.G. Mol. Biol. 1992; 26: 550-555Google Scholar). Recently, our laboratory was able to characterize a large cluster of human KAP genes located within the type I keratin gene domain on chromosome 17q12-21. This cluster contained four novel hKAP1 genes, which were designated hKAP1.1B, hKAP1.3, hKAP1.4, and hKAP1.5 (16Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence differences among these genes and the previously described hB2A andhB2B genes, we renamed the latter hKAP1.1A(hB2A) and hKAP1.2 (hB2B), respectively (16Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar). In addition, we identified two novel KAP1 members, hKAP1.6 and hKAP1.7, by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from a Japanese individual and by screening a Caucasian scalp cDNA library (17Shimomura Y. Aoki N. Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Schweizer J. Ito M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 226-231Google Scholar). However, the chromosomal assignment of the hKAP1.6 andhKAP1.7 genes as well as that of the hKAP1.1A andhKAP1.2 genes (9Zhumbaeva B.D. Gening L.V. Gazaryan K.G. Mol. Biol. 1992; 26: 550-555Google Scholar) remained to be determined.Each of the eight hKAP1 members shared a generally high homology in both nucleotide and amino acid sequence (16Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar, 17Shimomura Y. Aoki N. Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Schweizer J. Ito M. J. Invest.

However, comparisons among the hKAP1.1A/B, hKAP1.6, andhKAP1.7 genes not only yielded a particularly high amino acid homology but also an extraordinary conservation of their 3′-noncoding region and, with the exception of the hKAP1.1Agene (9Zhumbaeva B.D. Gening L.V. Gazaryan K.G. Mol. Biol. 1992; 26: 550-555Google Scholar), their 5′-noncoding region (17Shimomura Y. Aoki N. Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Schweizer J. Ito M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 226-231Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to further investigate the relationship among these genes. In this study, we analyzed genomic DNA of 100 Japanese and 100 Caucasian individuals and show that the hKAP1.1A,hKAP1.6, and hKAP1.7 genes are size polymorphisms of the hKAP1.1B gene. Moreover, a polymorphism analysis of the remaining hKAP1 genes resulted in the identification of several polymorphic variants of the hKAP1.3 gene. RT-PCR, 3′-RACE, ISH, and IIF studies were performed showing the expression of these genes in the human hair follicle.DISCUSSIONRecently, we described an ∼400-kb gene cluster on human chromosome 17q12-q21, which contained seven KAP multigene families, embedded into the type I keratin gene domain. Among these families were four genes of the hKAP1 family that we designatedhKAP1.1B, hKAP1.3, hKAP1.4, andhKAP1.5 (16Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar). In a subsequent paper, we identified two additional human KAP1 genes, which were termedhKAP1.6 and hKAP1.7 (17Shimomura Y. Aoki N. Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Schweizer J. Ito M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 226-231Google Scholar). Together with two previously described human KAP1 genes, originally designatedhB2A and hB2B (9Zhumbaeva B.D. Gening L.V. Gazaryan K.G. Mol. Biol. 1992; 26: 550-555Google Scholar) but later renamedhKAP1.1A and hKAP1.2 by us (16Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar), the number of known hKAP1 genes amounted then to eight. Because thehKAP1.1A, hKAP1.2, hKAP1.6, andhKAP1.7 genes did not appear to be part of theKAP gene cluster on chromosome 17q12-21, we suggested their location elsewhere in the human genome (17Shimomura Y. Aoki N. Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Schweizer J. Ito M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 226-231Google Scholar).In this study carried out in a large collection of Japanese and Caucasian individuals, we correct this assumption by demonstrating that the hKAP1.1A, hKAP1.6, and hKAP1.7genes are in fact polymorphic alleles of the hKAP1.1B gene. However, of these four polymorphic alleles, only thehKAP1.1B and hKAP1.6 alleles were found in this study. Although the hKAP1.1B allele was detected with high frequency in both populations investigated, the frequency of thehKAP1.6 allele was distinctly different in Japanese (0.210) and Caucasian individuals (0.005), thus indicating that most probablyhKAP1.6 represents a Japanese-specific polymorphism (TableII). Although the hKAP1.1A and hKAP1.7 alleles were not found in this study, each of them might represent a rare polymorphic hKAP1.1B allele.Similar to the hKAP1.1B gene, we also identified several polymorphic alleles of the hKAP1.3 gene. ThehKAP1.3 and hKAP1.8A alleles were commonly found with high frequencies in both Japanese and Caucasian individuals (TableII). In contrast, the hKAP1.8B allele was present in 40 Japanese individuals, whereas it was found in only a single Caucasian individual (Table II). Just like the hKAP1.6 allele, the frequency of the hKAP1.8B allele is so different between the two populations (0.200 in Japanese; 0.005 in Caucasians) that it can also be considered a Japanese-specific polymorphism. ThehKAP1.9 allele was identified only in a single Caucasian individual (Table II), suggesting that it represents a rarehKAP1.3 size polymorphism in the Caucasian population. ThehKAP1.8A allele and the Japanese-specifichKAP1.8B allele are identical with the exception of three nucleotide differences (G-C, C-T, and G-A, Fig. 3 A) in their coding regions. In all of the individuals analyzed, no recombination among these three sites has been observed. Thus, the nucleotides C, T, and A in hKAP1.8B appear to be single nucleotide polymorphisms typical for the Japanese population.It is evident that the two Japanese-specific hKAP1.6 andhKAP1.8B alleles arose subsequent to the divergence of the Caucasian and Japanese lineage. Interestingly, an overall analysis of the distribution of the hKAP1.1B and hKAP1.3alleles in Japanese and Caucasian individuals (TableIII) suggests that the hKAP1.6and hKAP1.8B alleles might be linked with a high frequency. Pending the confirmation of frequenthKAP1.6/hKAP1.8B linkage by genomic sequencing, this could mean that the actual distribution of thehKAP1.6/hKAP1.8B allele goes back to a founder effect in the Japanese population subsequent to the divergence from the Caucasian lineage. Conceptually, the linkage of hKAP1.6 andhKAP1.8B would also help to explain the presence of these two alleles in a single Caucasian individual by unrecognized Japanese ancestry.Table IIIRelationship between the hKAP1.1B and hKAP1.3 geneshKAP1.1B genehKAP1.3 geneJapanese (100 individuals)Caucasian (100 individuals)1.1B/1.1B1.3/1.313351.3/1.8A35401.8A/1.8A13231.8A/1.9011.1B/1.61.3/1.8B1711.8A/1.8B1801.8A/1.8A1*01.6/1.61.8B/1.8B201.8A/1.8B1*0hKAP1.6 and hKAP1.8B alleles are indicated in bold. Note that the individuals who are homozygous for thehKAP1.1B allele never have the hKAP1.8B allele, which exists only in individuals with the hKAP1.6 allele. Asterisks show individuals that do not exhibit linkage between thehKAP1.6 and hKAP1.8B alleles. Open table in a new tab We previously divided hKAP1 proteins into five distinct domains: an N-terminal domain, a highly repetitive domain I, a central non-repetitive domain, a less repetitive domain II, and a C-terminal domain (16Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar, 17Shimomura Y. Aoki N. Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Schweizer J. Ito M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 226-231Google Scholar, 27Shimomura Y. Aoki N. Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Schweizer J. Ito M. J. Invest. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The multialignment of both hKAP1.1B and hKAP1.3 with their respective polymorphic variants revealed that the differences among them were essentially because of variations in the repetitive domain I (Fig. 6). In hKAP1.1A/B and hKAP1.3, this domain comprises two extended tandem repeats, each consisting of a previously unidentified 16-amino acid segment “FCG(F/Y)PS(C/F)STGGTC(G/D)SS” followed by 6 and 4 (4 and 4 in hKAP1.3) previously described cysteine-rich pentapeptide repeats, respectively (Fig. 6). Relative to hKAP1.1A/B, the Japanese-specific hKAP1.6 protein has entirely lost the first version of the extended quasi tandem repeats of the repetitive domain I. Based on the numerical dominance of the hKAP1.1B allele in both the Caucasian and Japanese population, we assume that the hKAP1.6 protein arose through the corresponding intragenic deletion in the hKAP1.1B gene. Moreover, a one amino acid exchange (Fig. 6 A, Pro to Arg in bold) at the beginning of the second tandem repeat of domain I of the two proteins resulted also from an accompanying single nucleotide polymorphism (CCT to CGT) in the two genes. Compared with hKAP1.3, the hKAP1.8 protein exhibits an insertion of two tandem pentapeptide repeats in the repetitive domain I (Fig. 6 B). Because hKAP1.3and hKAP1.8A exhibit nearly identical allele frequencies (Table II), it is difficult to decide whether this difference is originally attributed to a corresponding intragenic insertion inhKAP1.3 or a deletion in hKAP1.8A. Although the generation of hKAP1.9 can also be traced back to an intragenic deletion of repetitive segments in domain I of either the hKAP1.3 orhKAP1.8A gene (Fig. 6 B), notable exceptions from this rule exist for the evolution of the hKAP1.2 and hKAP1.7 proteins. Although relative to hKAP1.3, hKAP1.2 still exhibits the loss of two tandem pentapeptide repeats of the repetitive domain I. It also differs from all known hKAP1 proteins by the unique sequence FCDFLASQLVDLQLS, replacing the second 16 amino acid repeat FCG(F/Y)PS(C/F)STGGTC(G/D)SS of the repetitive domain I as well as by an aberrant SSCHS C-terminal sequence (Fig. 6 B). Considering that the hKAP1.2gene is physically linked with the polymorphic hKAP1.1Bvariant hKAP1.1A, which also exhibits unique sequences in its 5′-upstream region (9Zhumbaeva B.D. Gening L.V. Gazaryan K.G. Mol. Biol. 1992; 26: 550-555Google Scholar), it is clear that these genes have evolved together and may represent rare possibly geographical polymorphisms. This may also be true for the hKAP1.7 gene, which relative to hKAP1.1A exhibits a highly unusual deletion starting within the FCG(F/Y)PS(C/F)STGGTC(G/D)SS segment of domain I and terminating in the central non-repetitive domain (Fig.6 A).It should be emphasized that the main type of size polymorphisms described here for the hKAP1.1B and hKAP1.3 genes has previously been reported for sheep KAP1 genes. At present, four sheep KAP1 genes, B2A throughB2D, are known (32Rogers G.R. Hickford J.G. Bickerstaffe R. Anim. Genet. 1994; 25: 407-415Google Scholar). Because of species-specific amino acid insertions, their orthology with the four human KAP1 genes,hKAP1.1B, hKAP1.3, hKAP1.4 andhKAP1.5, is difficult to assess (16Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar). Remarkably, however, the analysis of the sheep genes in unrelated animals of the same breeding revealed both insertion or deletion polymorphisms of the cysteine-rich pentapeptide tandem-repeats in the repetitive domain I of two proteins, B2A and B2C, but not in the remaining B2B and B2D proteins (32Rogers G.R. Hickford J.G. Bickerstaffe R. Anim. Genet. 1994; 25: 407-415Google Scholar). Thus, the present data in two species clearly indicate a functional tolerance of a varying number of cysteine-rich repeats in distinct KAP1 members.Tolerance of extended frequently population-specific tandem-repeat pattern polymorphisms, have also been reported for both the human and animal loricrin and involucrin genes (33Simon M. Phillips M. Green H. Stroh H. Glatt K. Bruns G. Latt S.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1989; 45: 910-916Google Scholar, 34Simon M. Phillips M. Green H. Genomics. 1991; 9: 576-580Google Scholar, 35Yoneda K.

On the other hand, it has been shown that heterozygous point mutations, which entail a frameshift in the loricrin gene leading to abnormal protein synthesis, are causal for the ichthyotic variant of Vohwinkel's syndrome (38Maestrini E. Monaco A.P. McGrath J.A. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Camisa C. Hovnanian A. Weeks D.E. Lathrop M. Uitto J. Christiano A.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 70-77Google Scholar, 39Korge B.P. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Punter C.

Dermatol. 1998; 111: 702-704Google Scholar). In this study, we also detected a heterozygous point mutation that would lead to a heavily truncated hKAP1.1B protein in two individuals of a two-generation Japanese family. Although one of these individuals suffered from a rather severe hair disorder resembling hypothrichosis, her father had apparently normal hair, thus questioning a causality of the mutation in the affected individual. However, it is known that a variety of hair disorders, i.e. monilethrix or the loose anagen hair syndrome, can considerably improve with age (41Zimmermann R. Dermatol. Monatsschr. 1983; 169: 638-645Google Scholar,42Li V.W. Baden H. Kvedar J.C. Dermatol. Clin. 1996; 14: 745-751Google Scholar), particularly in those cases where the childhood phenotype was only recognizable by electron microscopy (43Winter H. Labrèze C. Chapalain V. Surlève-Bazeille J.E. Mercier M. Rogers M.A. Taieb A. Schweizer J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 169-172Google Scholar). Although theoretically this may also be the case in the Japanese family we analyzed, it is clear that further studies on larger affected families, which also would allow linkage analyses or alternatively transgenic models, are needed to confirm the pathogenicity of single mutated KAP members.In conclusion, our study has revealed tandem-repeat pattern polymorphisms in human KAP1 genes. Obviously, despite the concomitant loss of a large number of cysteine residues, which should influence the strength of KAP protein interaction with hair keratin IFs, this phenomenon remains without recognizable phenotypic consequences, although structural microheterogeneities cannot be excluded. We also detected population-specific hKAP1 polymorphisms in Caucasian and Japanese individuals, which however cannot account for the differences in the respective hair phenotypes. On the other hand, it cannot be excluded that in view of the extraordinary high number of similarly repetitive KAPs potentially prone to size polymorphisms, distinct patterns of multiple KAP polymorphisms may influence the structure of the hair in a population-specific manner. Moreover, the extension of this study to other human populations, in particular from Africa and elsewhere in Asia, as well as the inclusion of our closest primate relatives may reveal KAPs to be useful tools regarding the elucidation of the time and geography of evolution of modern human populations. The major structural proteins of mammalian hair are the hair keratins and their associated proteins. The hair keratins belong to the large keratin multigene family, which mainly comprises genes that are expressed in various types of epithelia. Hair keratins form the intermediate filament (IF) 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; KAP, hair keratin-associated protein; RT, reverse transcription; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ISH, in situ hybridization; IIF, indirect immunofluorescence; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; KAP, hair keratin-associated protein; RT, reverse transcription; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ISH, in situ hybridization; IIF, indirect immunofluorescence; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.network in trichocytes, i.e. cells that populate the central hair-forming compartment (hair matrix, cortex, and cuticle) of the anagen hair follicle. In the hair cortex, hair keratin IFs are embedded in an interfilamentous matrix, consisting of hair keratin-associated proteins (KAPs), which are essential for the formation of a rigid and resistant hair shaft through their extensive disulfide bond cross-linking with abundant cysteine residues of hair keratins (1Powell B.C. Nesci A. Rogers G.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 642: 1-20Google Scholar,2Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 59-148Google Scholar). Originally, KAPs, mostly of ovine origin, have been classified on the basis of their amino acid composition as high sulfur (16–30 mol % cysteine), ultra-high sulfur (>30 mol % cysteine), and high glycine/tyrosine proteins (2Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 59-148Google Scholar). In 1993, Rogers and Powell (3Rogers G.E. Powell B.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: S50-S55Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) introduced a species-independent nomenclature using the abbreviations KAP1.n through KAP8.n for the eight members known at that time with “n” referring to a number identifying individual members fitting into a given family on the basis of sequence homology and the nature of repeat structures often present in these proteins (3Rogers G.E. Powell B.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: S50-S55Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Since then, the number of new KAPs from sheep, rabbit, mouse, and humans have steadily increased (2Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 59-148Google Scholar), and to date, a total of 23 KAP families are known. Of these, families 1–3, 10–16, and 23 represent high sulfur KAPs (2Powell B.C. Rogers G.E. Jolles P. Zahn H. Höcker H. Formation and Structure of Human Hair. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1997: 59-148Google Scholar, 4–17), 2Recently, a large cluster containing 23 novel hKAP genes and nine pseudogenes has been identified on chromosome 21q22.1 (M.

Gening L.V. Gazaryan K.G. Mol. Biol. 1992; 26: 550-555Google Scholar). Recently, our laboratory was able to characterize a large cluster of human KAP genes located within the type I keratin gene domain on chromosome 17q12-21. This cluster contained four novel hKAP1 genes, which were designated hKAP1.1B, hKAP1.3, hKAP1.4, and hKAP1.5 (16Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar). On the basis of sequence differences among these genes and the previously described hB2A andhB2B genes, we renamed the latter hKAP1.1A(hB2A) and hKAP1.2 (hB2B), respectively (16Rogers M.A. Langbein L. Winter H. Ehmann C. Praetzel S. Schweizer J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19440-19451Google Scholar). In addition, we identified two novel KAP1 members, hKAP1.6 and hKAP1.7, by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from a Japanese individual and by screening a Caucasian scalp cDNA library (17Shimomura Y.

ACC synthase catalyzes the committed step in the biosynthesis of ethylene, a plant hormone that is responsible for the initiation of fruit ripening and for regulating many other developmental processes. AVG is widely used in plant physiology studies to inhibit the activity of ACC synthase. The structural assignment is supported by the fact that the complex absorbs maximally at 341 nm. These results are not in accord with the recently reported crystal structure of the tomato ACC synthase AVG complex, which claims that the inhibitor only associates noncovalently. The rate constant for the association of AVG with apple ACC synthase was determined by stopped-flow spectrophotometry (2.1 × 105m−1 s−1) and by the rate of loss of enzyme activity (1.1 × 105m−1 s−1). The dissociation rate constant determined by activity recovery is 2.4 × 10−6 s−1. Thus, the calculatedK d value is 10–20 pm.

The plant hormone ethylene, which regulates many aspects of plant growth, development, and senescence is synthesized in the Yang cycle (1Yang S.F. Hoffmann N.E. Annu. Rev. Plant.

This enzyme catalyzes the α,γ-elimination of methylthioadenosine (MTA) fromS-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) to produce ACC (Scheme FS1). The production of ACC from SAM is the committed and rate-determining step in ethylene biosynthesis; therefore, the reaction and inhibition mechanisms of ACC synthase attract considerable interest for agricultural applications. Among the most potent inhibitors of ACC synthase is l-aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) (2Icekson I. Apelbaum A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which is widely used for plant physiology studies and agricultural applications. The structure of unliganded ACC synthase from Malus domestica to 2.4-Å resolution is available (3Capitani G. Hohenester E. Feng L. Storici P. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Here we describe the structure of the complex of apple ACC synthase with AVG at 1.6-Å resolution together with the rate constants characterizing its formation and decomposition. The structure results disagree with those reported by Huai et al. (4Huai Q. Xia Y. Chen Y. Callahan B. Li N. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38210-38216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) at lower resolution (2.7 Å) on the tomato ACC synthase AVG complex. WT and E47Q ACC synthase were purified for biochemical studies as described previously (5McCarthy D.L. Capitani G. Feng L. Gruetter M.G. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12276-12284Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recombinant V435STOP apple ACC synthase was prepared as described previously (6Feng L. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2436-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and crystallized at 293 K by the vapor diffusion method (sitting drop). 1 μl of protein solution containing 15 mg/ml enzyme, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 μm PLP, 1 mm DTT, and 4 mm AVG was mixed with an equal amount of reservoir containing 30% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) (v/v) and 50 mm MES, pH 6.5. The space group of the crystals is C2 with cell parametersa = 103.3 Å, b = 61.1 Å,c = 77.1 Å, and β = 123.4°. The asymmetric unit contains a monomer of ACC synthase, corresponding to a solvent content of 38%. The data to 1.6 Å were collected at 100 K using a MAR Research (Hamburg, Germany) imaging plate at the Swiss-Norwegian Beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, Switzerland). Data were reduced with DENZO and other programs of the CCP4 suite (7Collaborative computational project number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

A mF o− DF c map calculated after the first round of simulated annealing and thermal refinement exhibited clear difference density corresponding to a covalent adduct between the PLP cofactor and AVG (Fig. 1). A model for the adduct (residue code PPG) was built into the density and included in the refinement. Subsequently, 332 water molecules and a molecule of MPD were added to the model. Refinement was performed with X-PLOR 3.85 with topology and parameter files TOPHCSDX.PRO and PARHCSDX.PRO (11Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Absorbance values at 421 and 341 nm (the PLP-aldimine and ketimine species, respectively) measured during the course of reactivation of AVG-inactivated ACC synthase were corrected for changes in protein concentration over time by normalization of the absorbance of each sample at 280 nm. Rapid reaction studies monitoring the rate of formation of the PLP-ketimine species upon incubation of WT and E47Q ACC synthase with AVG were carried out with a temperature-controlled Applied PhotoPhysics model SF.17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Ketimine formation was monitored at 341 nm, and data were fit to first-order kinetics. ACC synthase activity in the presence of AVG was monitored by a continuous coupled assay (14White M.F.

Reactions were initiated by the addition of ACC synthase to mixtures of AVG, SAM, and coupling enzyme preequilibrated in buffer at 25 °C. Resulting reaction progress curves were fit to Equation 1 (15Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

The rate constant for association of the enzyme with AVG was determined from a plot of k obs versus inhibitor concentration. The structure of V435 STOP apple ACC synthase, cocrystallized in the space group C2 with AVG, was determined by molecular replacement with the unliganded enzyme structure as search model. The crystals contain one monomer of the ACC synthase dimer per asymmetric unit with the two subunits related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis. The structure was refined to 1.6-Å resolution and anR-factor of 20.5% (R-free 21.9%) with excellent stereochemical parameters (Table I). Difference Fourier map analysis from the first step of refinement revealed that AVG is bound covalently to PLP (Fig.1). Lys-273 is clearly displaced from the cofactor. The distance between the C4A atom of PLP and the side-chain amino group of the lysine is 3.7 Å. The final refined model for the apple ACC synthase-AVG complex encompasses 424 residues, the covalent adduct AVG·PLP, a molecule of MPD that was used in the crystallization solution, and 332 water molecules. The geometry of the refined AVG·PLP is that of a ketimine adduct with the AVG Cα atom and the C4A atom of PLP exhibiting sp2 and sp3 hybridization, respectively. The present results differ significantly from those recently published by Huai et al. (4Huai Q. Xia Y. Chen Y. Callahan B. Li N. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38210-38216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) describing a complex between tomato ACC synthase and AVG. Huai et al. (4Huai Q. Xia Y. Chen Y.

They also solved the structure of an ACC synthase-AVG complex cocrystallized in the space group P6422 with 1B8G as a search model (4Huai Q. Xia Y. Chen Y. Callahan B. Li N. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38210-38216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Huaiet al. (4Huai Q. Xia Y. Chen Y. Callahan B. Li N. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38210-38216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) report that final refined model (PDB code 1IAY) of that complex contains no covalent adduct between the cofactor and the inhibitor. They find that AVG is bound near the entrance of the active site with its α-amino group ∼4 Å from the PLP C4A. In 1IAY, AVG binds to the protein through its α-carboxylate group, which accepts two hydrogen bonds, one from the backbone nitrogen of Ala-54 and the other from a guanidinium nitrogen of Arg-412. A third hydrogen bond is donated to the α-carboxylate of AVG by a water molecule. This mode of AVG binding, involving a few weak interactions, cannot be reconciled with our crystallographic results. Our refinement strategy was aimed at avoiding model bias; thus, neither cofactor nor AVG was included in the first steps of refinement against the 1.6-Å diffraction data. Simulated annealing at 5000 K ensured additionally that residual model bias from the internal aldimine of 1B8G was removed. A difference Fourier map after one cycle of individual B-factor refinement contoured at 3 ς exhibited a very clear and strong signal corresponding to the AVG·PLP covalent adduct shown in Fig. 1. Clausen et al. (16Clausen T. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. Pohlenz H.D. Laber B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12633-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and Krupka et al.(17Krupka H.I. Huber R. Holt S.C. Clausen T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3168-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) also find covalent AVG·PLP adducts in Escherichia coli cystathionine-β-lyase (CBL) and in Treponema denticola cystalysin (PDB codes 1CL2 and 1C7O), respectively. Incubation of ACC synthase with AVG results in the rapid disappearance of the PLP internal aldimine absorption band at 421 nm with concomitant appearance of an enzyme species that absorbs at 341 nm (Fig. 2). The extinction coefficient for the latter is ∼34,600 m−1cm−1. We propose that the absorption band at 341 nm is consistent with the formation of an AVG·PLP ketimine adduct. For comparison, the λmax and ε values for the aspartate-PLP ketimine species formed by aspartate aminotransferase are 323 nm and 6,770m−1cm−1 (18Goldberg J.M. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5280-5291Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An AVG·PLP ketimine species (Scheme FS1), however, would contain an additional conjugated π bond and heteroatom, thus producing the observed bathochromic shift and hyperchromic effect. Moreover, the structurally characterized AVG-ketimine in the CBL complex also absorbs maximally at 341 nm, and its ε value is 27,500m−1cm−1 (16Clausen T. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. Pohlenz H.D. Laber B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12633-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Rate constants for the appearance of the ketimine absorption band at 341 nm were measured as a function of AVG concentration. A linear plot of the data yields ka= 2.1 (± 0.2) × 105m−1 s−1 (Fig.3). kawas also determined by measuring the rate of enzyme inactivation in the presence of AVG. Initial rates of enzyme-catalyzed product formation are independent of the concentration of AVG, but the enzyme is inactivated over time in an AVG-dependent manner (Fig.4). Observed first-order inactivation rate constants (k obs) were fit to Equation 2(15Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar),kobs=ka[AVG]1+[SAM]/KmEquation 2 where K m is the experimentally determined Michaelis-Menten constant for SAM under the assay conditions described in the figure legend, and the value of kaobtained by this method is 1.1 × 105m−1s−1, in reasonable agreement with that determined spectrophotometrically. ACC synthase activity is recoverable from the AVG·PLP complex (Fig.5 A). Dialysis of AVG-inactivated enzyme against buffer containing 10 μmPLP results in the loss of the 341-nm absorption band and complete recovery of the internal aldimine absorption with a rate constant of 2.4 (± 0.5) × 10−6 s−1. These spectral changes are accompanied by recovery of enzyme activity with the same rate constant (Fig. 5 B). Dialysis of the inactivated enzyme against buffer lacking PLP yields only ∼35% of the absorbance change at 341 nm observed in the presence of the cofactor, and this decay in absorbance at 341 nm is not accompanied by an increase in absorbance at 421 nm. Furthermore, only 15% of the original enzyme activity is recovered. Therefore, dissociation of AVG is accompanied by PLP loss. The rate constants for disappearance of absorption at 341 nm and recovery of activity are 1.6 (± 0.3) × 10−6 s−1 and 3.0 (± 1.4) × 10−6 s−1, respectively in the absence of PLP in the dialysis medium. Although the disappearance of the ketimine absorption band was not accompanied by the appearance of the aldimine absorption band, recovery of activity was observed because of the presence of PLP (1 μm) in the activity assay mixture.Figure 4Inactivation of WT ACC synthase by AVG.Inset, progress curves showing the concentration of MTA formed by ACC synthase as a function of time.

WT ACC synthase (65 μm) was incubated with 120 μm AVG in 30 mm TAPS, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm DDT. After ∼1 min, excess AVG was removed by gel filtration, and the inactivated enzyme was diluted to 25 μm and dialyzed against the same buffer with or without the addition of 10 μm PLP (closed andopen symbols, respectively). A, the spectra of the enzyme were recorded over time, and the absorbancies of the PLP-aldimine (squares, 421 nm; active enzyme) and AVG-ketimine (circles, 341 nm; inactive enzyme) species are plotted. The data were fit to first-order kinetics yielding rate constants of 2.4 (± 0.5) × 10−6 s−1 in the presence of PLP (solid lines; average of both ketimine and aldimine absorption curves), and 1.6 (± 0.3) × 10−6 s−1 in the absence of PLP (dashed line; ketimine absorption only). B, the activity of the enzyme with SAM was measured (14White M.F. Vasquez J. Yang S.F. Kirsch J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The data were fit to first-order kinetics yielding rate constants of 2.5 (± 0.6) × 10−6 s−1 and 3.0 (± 1.4) × 10−6 s−1 in the presence and absence of PLP, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Superposition of the unliganded (PDB code 1B8G) and AVG-inhibited ACC synthase structures shows that association of AVG with the enzyme does not induce large conformational changes (Fig.6 C). The root mean square deviation between the two structures is 0.7 Å. The only large-scale differences are found in the small domain. 1) A part of the small domain encompassing mainly helix α1, strand β2, helix α13, and strand β13 (nomenclature is according to Ref. 3Capitani G. Hohenester E. Feng L. Storici P. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) is slightly displaced toward the large domain of the other subunit. The program DYNDOM identifies this conformational change as a rotation of the aforementioned “subdomain” by ∼7° around an axis that crosses the small domain and is approximately parallel to the dimer axis. However, whether one considers the small domain as a whole, no overall domain movement can be identified by visual inspection or by DYNDOM (19Hayward S. Kitao A. Berendsen H.J. Proteins. 1997; 27: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). 2) The main chain conformation at the beginning of helix α1 is rearranged so that Tyr-19 points inside the active site in the AVG-bound structure (see following paragraph). The AVG·PLP adduct is tightly bound in the active site of ACC synthase (K d = 10–20 pm based on the ratio of the kaand kdvalues described above). Fig. 7 is a LIGPLOT scheme (20Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (4367) Google Scholar) that shows all hydrogen-bonding interactions that contribute to AVG association, and Fig. 6 A presents a stereoview of the active site. The PLP moiety of the adduct retains the strong interactions between the phosphate group and the enzyme side chains that are present in the unliganded structure (PDB code 1B8G) (3Capitani G. Hohenester E. Feng L. Storici P. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The position of the phosphate is only slightly modified with respect to 1B8G, whereas the pyridine ring of the cofactor appears to be tilted by ∼16°. Thus, the phosphate moiety acts as an anchor. It is noteworthy that the formation of the external aldimine or ketimine not only tilts the cofactor but pushes the ring 1.1 Å down toward the carboxylate of Asp-230 to form a relatively strong hydrogen bond (2.7 Å) in the complex. These crystallographic results confirm the theoretical model of a reaction intermediate of ACC synthase (external aldimine with ACC) described previously (3Capitani G. Hohenester E. Feng L. Storici P. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which predicted that such a hydrogen bond would be established upon external aldimine formation. The carboxylate group of the AVG·PLP adduct interacts strongly with the protein. It forms a doubly hydrogen-bonded salt bridge with Arg-407 and accepts a hydrogen bond from the carboxamide nitrogen of Asn-202. Notably, the AVG·PLP α-carboxylate receives a fourth hydrogen bond from the OH of Tyr-19. The side chain of Tyr-19 points toward the solvent in the unliganded ACC synthase structure, whereas in the ACC synthase-AVG complex there is a rearrangement involving residues 18–20 that results in the phenolic ring of Tyr-19, reaching the inner active site to interact with the AVG·PLP α-carboxylate group. The ε-amino group of the AVG side chain in the complex makes a triple electrostatic interaction with Glu-47 and Lys-273. The side chain of Glu-47 is found in a different orientation with respect to the unliganded enzyme, and its γ-carboxylate is the pivot for the formation of this interaction. The side chain amino groups of both AVG and Lys-273 donate hydrogen bonds to the Glu-47 γ-carboxylate, which also receives another hydrogen bond from the carboxamide nitrogen of Gln-83 of the other subunit (Gln-83*). A comparison of the AVG-bound ACC synthase and CBL active sites (Fig. 6 B) (16Clausen T. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. Pohlenz H.D. Laber B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12633-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) provides a structural basis for the different AVG affinities of the two enzymes (K i = 1.1 μm for CBL;K d = 10–20 pm for ACC synthase). The two AVG·PLP adducts superimpose very well; however, the side chain of AVG·PLP interacts with CBL much more weakly than with ACC synthase because the AVG side chain in the CBL·AVG complex points toward the active site entrance and its amino group is held in place mainly by weaker interactions with the hydroxyl group of Tyr-111 and with two water molecules. A molecule of the precipitating agent MPD is found at the entrance of the active site of AVG-bound ACC synthase. Interestingly, the MPD association is stereoselective. Racemic MPD was used for crystallization, but only the R-enantiomer is found in the present structure. The two OH groups of R-MPD are the points of contact. One (O4 in the crystallographic atom naming) accepts a hydrogen bond from the guanidinium group of Arg-150, whereas the second (O2) is involved as donor in a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the carboxamide oxygen atom of Gln-83* and the ether atom of AVG. The addition of AVG to E47Q ACC synthase results in a rapid loss of the PLP internal aldimine absorption band at 421 nm, and concomitant appearance of an absorption band at 341 nm with an extinction coefficient of ∼35,200m−1cm−1 (data not shown). The rate constants for appearance of the absorption band at 341 nm were measured as a function of AVG concentration, yielding a second-order rate constant of 7.2 (± 0.7) × 104m−1s−1 for that reaction (see Fig. 3). The association of AVG with E47Q ACC synthase is reversible (Fig.8). Dialysis of AVG-bound E47Q ACC synthase against buffer containing 1 μm PLP results in a loss of the ketimine absorption band at 341 nm and recovery of the internal aldimine absorption band at 421 nm with a rate constant of 8.2 (± 1.7) × 10−5 s−1. The rate at which catalytic activity is recovered could not be determined because of the extremely low activity of the E47Q mutant for α,γ-elimination on SAM (5McCarthy D.L. Capitani G. Feng L. Gruetter M.G. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12276-12284Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We present crystallographic and biochemical evidence that AVG inhibits ACC synthase from M. domestica by forming a covalent ketimine complex with the PLP cofactor. The high resolution crystallographic evidence supported by spectroscopic and kinetic analyses cannot be reconciled with the findings of Huai et al. (4Huai Q. Xia Y. Chen Y. Callahan B. Li N. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38210-38216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) for the complex of Lycopersicum esculentum ACC synthase with the same inhibitor (PDB code 1IAY). That report claims that a noncovalent complex is formed between AVG and the holoenzyme and that it is stabilized only by two hydrogen bonds. An examination of electron density for 1IAY as calculated by the Uppsala University Electron Density Server (portray.bmc.uu.se/eds/index.html) shows that the AVG ligand is associated with the density only in its carboxylate moiety (assuming that the structure factor file deposited for 1IAY and used by the server corresponds to the ACC synthase-AVG complex). Our estimatedK d for apple ACC synthase·AVG is 10–20 pm. A weak non-covalent enzyme-inhibitor interaction as proposed by Huai et al. (4Huai Q. Xia Y. Chen Y. Callahan B. Li N. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38210-38216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) would suggest a much higherK d value. Finally, the 341-nm absorption maximum is incompatible with a conjugated aldimine. The identity level between theM. domestica and the L. esculentum (LE-ACS 2) sequences is very high (56% with 67% similarity), and all of the residues that could be involved in binding are conserved; thus, the very different structural results with AVG cannot be ascribed to differences between the tomato and the apple enzyme. In our structure, the very strong affinity of AVG toward ACC synthase nicely correlates with the formation of a ketimine adduct held in place by a dense network of interactions with the protein. This network involves both the side chain and α-carboxylate of AVG. Notably, there is a charge interaction between the side chain nitrogen of AVG and Glu-47 of ACC synthase. That residue has been shown to be functionally critical for the reaction mechanism (5McCarthy D.L. Capitani G. Feng L. Gruetter M.G. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12276-12284Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the contention of Huai et al. (4Huai Q. Xia Y. Chen Y. Callahan B. Li N. Ke H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38210-38216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) that monomeric ACC synthase may be active is incompatible with hybrid reconstitution results on apple ACC synthase (21Li Y. Feng L. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15477-15488Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which demonstrated unambiguously that the dimer or theoretically a higher oligomer is the functional form of the enzyme. The mutated residues (Lys-273 and Tyr-85) employed in the hybridization experiments are conserved throughout plant ACC synthase sequences. Finally, it should be emphasized that none of the characterized PLP-dependent enzymes of this class functions as a monomer. A covalent AVG-ketimine adduct is also present in two other PLP-dependent enzyme structures, CBL (16Clausen T. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. Pohlenz H.D. Laber B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12633-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and cystalysin (17Krupka H.I. Huber R. Holt S.C. Clausen T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3168-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The kinetics and equilibria of the reaction of AVG with CBL and ACC synthase are compared in Table II. Each enzyme reacts to form an AVG·PLP ketimine species that has a high affinity for the enzyme active site. Although the mechanisms for inhibition of both CBL and ACC synthase appear to be similar, the binding affinities of the two enzymes for AVG differ significantly. TheK d for the CBL complex is in the range of 0.3–1 μm, 2The K d value of ∼300 nm for CBL was determined from the ratio of the spectrophotometrically determined dissociation and association rate constants reported by Clausen et al. (16Clausen T. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. Pohlenz H.D. Laber B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12633-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and differs slightly from the K i value (1.1 μm) determined by kinetic analysis of activity inhibition and reported in the same paper.whereas that for ACC synthase is 10–20 pm. As shown in Table II, the lower affinity of CBL for AVG is expressed in both the association and dissociation rate constants. The value ofkafor ACC synthase is 1,400 times greater than that for CBL, whereas kdfor CBL is ∼15 times greater than that for ACC synthase. The much lower affinity of CBL for AVG can be explained by the weaker binding modes of the AVG side chain and α-carboxylate group to CBL. The structure of the CBL·AVG complex shows hydrogen bonds among the AVG ε-amino group, two water molecules, and Tyr-111, which probably make much weaker contacts than those present in the triple electrostatic interaction between the AVG ε-amino group and Glu-47 and Lys-273 in ACC synthase. Furthermore, the interaction between the α-carboxylate group of AVG and ACC synthase is strengthened by the presence of a hydrogen bond to Tyr-19, which is not present in CBL.Table IISummary of association and dissociation rate constants and Kdvalues for the AVG-PLP ketimine adduct formed with WT and E47Q · ACC synthases and CBLEnzymeka 2-aReported ka values were calculated from stopped-flow spectrophotometric measurements of ketimine formation rates. kd values were obtained by monitoring recovery of the internal aldimine absorbance band following removal of AVG from reaction mixtures.

Open table in a new tab kaandkdvalues for E47Q ACC synthase were determined to elucidate the value of the contribution of the carboxylate of Glu-47 to the stability of the complex (see Table II). The replacement of the Glu-47 carboxylate ion with an amide group results in a 100-fold decrease in affinity. kais three times lower for the E47Q mutant than for WT, and kdis 34 times greater for the E47Q·ACC synthase complex than it is for the corresponding WT ACC synthase complex. Although this decrease in affinity is significant, the K d for the E47Q·ACC synthase complex remains 300-fold less than that of the WT CBL complex which also lacks the Glu-47-AVG interaction, thus suggesting that other protein-inhibitor interactions such as the hydrogen bond between Tyr-19 and the α-carboxylate group are also important for the tight binding of AVG to ACC synthase. The fact that the E47Q mutation elicits such a large reduction (∼3 kcal/mol) in affinity of the enzyme for AVG supports the earlier conclusion that the carboxylate group of Glu-47 plays an important role in the recognition of the sulfonium group of the natural substrate SAM as suggested by mutational, kinetic, and modeling studies (5McCarthy D.L.

Hollanderova Z. Kormanec J. Sevcik J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 119: 147-148Google Scholar), were cloned from S. aureofaciens strains R8/26 and CCM 3239, respectively. Isolation of Sa ribonucleases after the expression of their genes inEscherichia coli has not been successful. Apparently, the enzymes are toxic to host cells despite their being directed for secretion. Successful heterologous production has been achieved only by the simultaneous expression of an Sa ribonuclease gene together with a gene encoding barstar, a protein inhibitor from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (15Hartley R.W. Both V. Hebert E.J. Homerova D. Jucovic M. Nazarov V. Rybajlak I. Sevcik J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1996; 4: 225-231Google Scholar). The yields range from 10 to 50 mg of protein/liter of culture medium (16Hebert E.J. Grimsley G.R. Hartley R.W. Horn G. Schell D. Garcia S. Both V. Sevcik J. Pace C.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 162-168Google Scholar). Barstar inhibits the enzymatic activity of Sa ribonucleases as it does barnase, its native partner, by sterically blocking the active site (17Sevcik J. Urbanikova L. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 954-963Google Scholar, 18Urbanikova L. Sevcik J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 403-404Google Scholar). Dissociation constants of the complexes of RNase Sa, Sa2, and Sa3 with barstar are 2 × 10−10, 4 × 10−10, and 2 × 10−12m, respectively. For comparison, the dissociation constant for the barnase/barstar complex is 10−14m (15Hartley R.W. Both V. Hebert E.J. Homerova D. Jucovic M. Nazarov V. Rybajlak I. Sevcik J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1996; 4: 225-231Google Scholar). The cytosol of mammalian cells contains a ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) 1The abbreviations used are: RI, ribonuclease inhibitor; hRI, human ribonuclease inhibitor; r.m.s., root mean square protein that binds tightly to mammalian secretory ribonucleases (19Hofsteenge J. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 621-658Google Scholar, 20Shapiro R. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 611-628Google Scholar). The ability of secretory ribonucleases from human (21Leland P.A. Staniszewski K.E. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43095-43102Google Scholar), cow (22Leland P.A. Schultz L.W.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 31-34Google Scholar, 26Kim J.-S. Soucek J. Matousek J. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10525-10530Google Scholar, 27Matousek J. Kim J.-S. Soucek J. Rihà J. Ribò M. Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 118B: 881-888Google Scholar), and frog (28Wu Y. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Google Scholar) to evade RI endows them with toxicity for mammalian cells. These secretory ribonucleases from vertebrates are not homologous to microbial ribonucleases. We suspected that a microbial secretory ribonuclease, such as RNase Sa3, could likewise be toxic to mammalian cells if its structure enables it to evade RI. Here, we report the atomic structure of two crystalline forms for RNase Sa3. We also report that RNase Sa3 does indeed have the ability to evade RI and is cytotoxic for human erythroleukemia cells. Thus, RNase Sa3 is a prokaryotic ribonuclease with demonstrable cytotoxic activity. Protein production, purification, and crystallization were performed as described previously (29Hlinkova V. Urbanikova L. Krajcikova D. Sevcik J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2001; 57: 737-739Google Scholar). The hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method was used to prepare two crystalline forms. Trigonal crystals (crystal I) in theP3121 space group with unit-cell dimensions ofa = b = 64.72 Å, c = 69.57 Å, and β = 120° were grown using 0.10m Hepes buffer, pH 7.6, containing Li2SO4 (1.6 m) as the precipitant solution. Hanging drops consisted of 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, containing protein (7.5 mg ml−1), Hepes (0.05 m), and Li2SO4 (0.8m). Tetragonal crystals (crystal II) in theP41212 space group with unit-cell dimensions of a = b = 34.05 Å andc = 147.22 Å were grown using 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (10%, v/v) and ammonium sulfate (40 mm) as the precipitant solution. Hanging drops consisted of 20 mm sodium acetate, 2 mm calcium acetate buffer, pH 4.2, containing protein (10 mg ml−1), 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (5%, v/v), and ammonium sulfate (20 mm). X-ray diffraction data collection and processing were performed as described previously (29Hlinkova V. Urbanikova L. Krajcikova D. Sevcik J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2001; 57: 737-739Google Scholar). Data from crystal I were collected to 2.0 Å at 100 K using synchrotron facilities at EMBL (Hamburg, Germany), and data from crystal II were collected likewise to 1.7 Å at room temperature. Data were processed with the HKL package (30Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). Data sets from both crystalline forms were 100% complete withR merge values of 6.0 and 3.6% for crystals I and II, respectively. The structures from crystals I (structure I) and II (structure II) were determined by molecular replacement using the program AMoRe (31Navaza J. Saludjian P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-619Google Scholar) and the structure of RNase Sa as a search model (Protein Data Bank entry 1RGG). The initial model yielded for structure I an R-factor of 46% and a correlation coefficient of 51.7% for data at 10–3 Å. The initial model yielded for structure II an R-factor of 47% and a correlation coefficient of 45.0% for data at 10–3 Å. Molecular replacement showed clearly that there was one protein molecule in the asymmetric unit in both structures (29Hlinkova V. Urbanikova L. Krajcikova D. Sevcik J. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2001; 57: 737-739Google Scholar). Individual atomic refinement was performed against 95% of the data by using the maximum likelihood program REFMAC5 (version 4.1) from the CCP4 package (32Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar) against 95% of the data. The remaining 5% of the data randomly excluded from the full data set by the program Uniqueify from the CCP4 package was used for cross-validation by means of theR free factor (33Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1993; 49: 24-36Google Scholar). The last refinement cycle was carried out against all of the data. The Sparse Matrix method was used for minimization. After each refinement cycle, the automated refinement procedure ARP/wARP (34Perrakis A. Morris R.M. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Google Scholar) was applied for modeling and updating the solvent structure. The models were inspected against 3F o − 2F c andF o − F c maps and adjusted manually between the cycles of refinement with the program O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). Both structures were refined with isotropic and, in later stages, anisotropic temperature factors including contributions to the structure factors from the hydrogen atoms, which were generated in standard geometries. The inclusion of hydrogen atoms lowered the values of R and R free by >1 unit. Isotropic and anisotropic temperature factors, bond lengths, and bond angles were restrained according to the standard criteria employed by REFMAC5. Human ribonuclease inhibitor (hRI) and RNase A were from Sigma. hRI was stored in 20 mm Hepes-KOH buffer, pH 7.6, containing glycerol (50%, v/v), KCl (50 mm), and dithiothreitol (8 mm). The effect of hRI on ribonucleolytic activity was measured as described previously (36Egami F. Takahashi K. Uchida T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1964; 3: 59-101Google Scholar) with minor modifications. RNase Sa3 was incubated with hRI for 5 min at room temperature. The enzymatic reaction was initiated at 37 °C by the addition of substrate. The reaction mixture (1.0 ml) was 0.10 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing a ribonuclease (RNase Sa3, RNase Sa, or RNase A), hRI, yeast RNA (3 mg), EDTA (1.0 mm), and dithiothreitol (5 mm). After 15 min, the enzymatic reaction was terminated by cooling the reaction mixture on ice for 2 min and then adding a solution (0.25 ml) of uranylacetate (0.75% w/v) in aqueous perchloric acid (25% v/v). The quenched reaction mixture was subjected to centrifugation, and the supernatant was diluted by 25-fold with distilled water before recording its absorbance at 260 nm. The concentration of ribonuclease in the reaction mixture was adjusted to give an increase in absorbance at 260 nm of 0.2–0.3 cm−1 in the absence of hRI. Onconase (22Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Google Scholar) and RNase Sa3 (16Hebert E.J. Grimsley G.R. Hartley R.W. Horn G. Schell D. Garcia S. Both V. Sevcik J. Pace C.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 162-168Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. K-562 cells, which are from a continuous human chronic myelogenous leukemia line, were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The effect of ribonucleases on the proliferation of K-562 cells was determined by measuring the incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine into cellular DNA as described previously (22Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 10407-10412Google Scholar, 37Leland P.A. Staniszewski K.E. Kim B.-M. Raines R.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 203-207Google Scholar) with the exception that the stock solution of ribonucleases was in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing NaCl (0.10 m). Data represent the average of quadruplicate samples within an individual assay. The IC50 value of each cytotoxic ribonuclease was calculated by using the equation: S = 100 × IC50/(IC50 + [ribonuclease]) whereS is the percent of total DNA synthesis after the incubation period (24Haigis M.C. Kurten E.L. Abel R.L. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11576-11581Google Scholar). The startingR-factors in the refinement were 46.5% (48.3%) for structure I (structure II). Refinement converged with R- andR free factors of 15.4% (18.6%) and 21.4% (22.4%), respectively. Both models have good geometry with r.m.s. deviations from ideal bond lengths and angles of 0.021 Å (0.020 Å) and 1.831° (1.783°). 93.9% (93.6%) of the ψ and φ dihedral angles were in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot (38Ramakhrisnan C. Ramachandran G.M. Biophys. J. 1965; 5: 909-933Google Scholar) as calculated with the program Procheck (39Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). None of the residues was in a disallowed region. For both structures, the dispersion precision indicator (59Cruickshank D.W.J. Dodson E. Moore M. Ralph A. Bailey S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend, Macromolecular Refinement. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1996: 11-22Google Scholar, 60Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J. CCP4 Newslett. Protein Crystallogr. 1997; 33: 31-39Google Scholar) based on the values ofR- and R free factors yields estimated standard uncertainty (ESU) <0.19 and <0.13 Å, respectively. The atomic coordinates of structure I and structure II of RNase Sa3 have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 1MGW and1MGR, respectively. The crystallographic refinement and model statistics are listed in Table I. The average temperature factors for main-chain atoms for both structures as a function of residue number are shown in Fig.1. Surprisingly, the B-factors are lower for structure II (room temperature data) than for structure I (100 K data), which can be explained by the lower water content in crystal forms II (34%) and I (68%). The average B-factors agree well with estimates from the Wilson plot (61Wilson A.J.C. Nature. 1942; 150: 151-152Google Scholar). The pattern of variation is similar for both structures, but the amplitude of variation is larger for structure II. The quality of the electron density in the interior of both structures is approximately equal despite the different resolutions and conditions for data collection.Table ISummary of crystallographic refinement and model statisticsStructure IStructure IIResolution range (Å)29.6–2.020.0–1.7Temperature (K)100293Unique reflections11,77910,355R free (%)21.422.4R(%)15.418.6Protein atoms782774Solvent molecules14549Li+ ion1—SO42− ion—1AverageB-factors (Å2)Main chain28.8224.75Side chain31.3127.42Protein atoms30.0526.08Solvent molecules42.3435.82Wilson plot estimate (Å2)28.5022.23ESU based on R (Å)0.1760.188ESU based onR free (Å)0.1250.112r.m.s. deviation from ideal geometry (target values in parentheses)Bond distances (Å)0.021 (0.021)0.020 (0.021)Bond angles (°)1.831 (1.931)1.783 (1.932)Chiral centers (Å3)0.105 (0.200)0.119 (0.200)Planar groups (Å)0.008 (0.020)0.008 (0.020)Main-chain bondB values (Å2)1.642 (1.500)2.067 (1.500)Main-chain angle B values (Å2)2.560 (2.000)3.129 (2.000)Side-chain bondB values (Å2)3.836 (3.000)3.880 (3.000)Side-chain angle B values (Å2)5.842 (4.500)5.728 (4.500)Residues in Ramachandran plot regions (excluding Pro, Gly, and terminal residues)Most favored (%)93.993.6Additional allowed (%)6.16.4ESU, estimated standard uncertainty. Open table in a new tab ESU, estimated standard uncertainty. Recombinant RNase Sa3 consists of 99 amino acid residues. The main secondary structure elements are an α-helix (residues 18–28) and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (residues 55–61, 72–78, and 82–87). The protein belongs to the Alpha Beta Roll group of the CATH classification of protein domain structures (40Orengo C.A. Michie A.D. Jones S. Jones B.T. Swindells M.B. Thornton J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1093-1108Google Scholar). The final model for structure I contains 782 protein atoms and 145 water molecules. The final model for structure II contains 774 protein atoms and 49 water molecules. The peptide bond preceding Pro30 is in the cis-conformation. The enzyme contains two cysteine residues in positions 10 and 99, which form a disulfide bond. In structure I, all residues were built, and there are no residues with alternative conformations. A difference electron density was seen after all refinement cycles in the middle of four water molecules arranged in the corners of a tetrahedron. A lithium cation was modeled at the site of difference electron density and refined as shown in Fig. 2 A. The distances to respective water molecules are 1.8–2.0 Å. TheB-factors of water molecules and the Li+ ion are 30–36 and 16 Å2, respectively. In structure II, residues Ala 1, Ser2, and the side chain of Val3 (which together form an N-terminal tail) are missing, because there was no electron density clear enough to model these residues. The electron density for Lys4 and Trp79 side chains was poor, resulting in temperature factors of up to 60 Å2. Alternative conformations were built for the Oγ atom of Ser12. A sulfate anion SO42− was modeled at the putative phosphoryl group binding site as shown in Fig. 2 B in analogy to one found in RNase Sa (8Sevcik J. Dauter Z. Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1996; 52: 327-344Google Scholar). The average S–O bond length was 1.45 Å. The room temperature and low temperature structures are almost identical. An overlap of the two structures based on the minimization of distances between 94 Cα atoms (excluding the five N-terminal Cα atoms) yields an r.m.s. displacement of 0.50 Å with a maximum displacement of 1.75 Å at the Trp79 side chain. In structure I, each molecule makes intermolecular contacts with three neighbors. The crystal consists of a lattice of molecules that form continuous parallel chains between those that are large channels of the solvent corresponding to 68% crystal volume. Between each pair of chains, every third molecule forms close intermolecular contacts with its partner from the neighboring chain. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the N-terminal loops of two neighboring molecules are intertwined and trapped between the two molecules, forming a number of contacts that prevent disorder. In structure II, each molecule makes intermolecular contacts with 12 neighboring molecules. The molecules are packed closely, which results in a solvent content of only 34%. It is interesting to note that four neighboring molecules in the crystal face each other with disordered regions. As shown in Fig. 2 D, this interface contains N-terminal residues of two molecules and Trp79 residues of two other molecules. The disorder of these regions is surprising as the space in the interface does not seem to be large enough to allow for substantial atomic motion. Sa ribonucleases catalyze the cleavage of the P–O5′ bonds of single-stranded RNA on the 3′ side of guanosine nucleotides (62Zelinkova E. Bacova M. Zelinka J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 235: 343-352Google Scholar). The most thoroughly studied Streptomycete ribonuclease is RNase Sa, the structure of which was determined at various resolutions, including atomic. As shown in Fig. 3, a comparison of the amino acid sequences of RNase Sa and RNase Sa3 reveals that there are 67 identical residues (69% identity), 17 of which are conserved in all enzymes belonging to the prokaryotic subfamily of microbial ribonucleases. There are five key residues: Asn42, Glu44, Glu57, Arg72, and His88 (Sa3 numbering) that are conserved strictly in all microbial ribonucleases of the T1 family. By analogy, Glu57 and His88 participate in general acid base catalysis. Glu44 and Arg72participate in nucleobase and phosphoryl group binding, respectively. The side chain of Asn42 plays an important role in stabilizing the main-chain loop that forms the binding site for the nucleobase of a substrate. Replacing an equivalent asparagine residue in RNase Sa with aspartate, alanine, or serine decreases the conformational stability of the enzyme by 1.5–2.3 kcal/mol (9Hebert E.J. Giletto A. Sevcı́k J. Urbániková L. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Pace C.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16192-16200Google Scholar) and decreases the catalytic activity by 85%. 2L. Urbanikova, unpublished data. The N39S variant of RNase Sa also shows unexpected changes in structure (Protein Data Bank code 1BOX). An overlap of RNase Sa3 structure I with the structure of RNase Sa based on minimization of distances between those corresponding Cα atoms that form the core of the molecules (37 atoms) yields an r.m.s. deviation of 0.35 Å and a maximum deviation of 0.84 Å, which is the distance between the Cα atoms of Gly28 (Sa3) and Asp25 (Sa). This superposition reveals a high degree of similarity as depicted in Fig. 2 E. Differences in the main-chain fold are seen only at the N and C termini and reached 5 and 2 Å, respectively. The N-terminal residues of RNase Sa are well determined as they are laid on the surface of the molecule. The situation is different in RNase Sa3 in which the N-terminal residues form a tail that does not contact the remainder of the molecule but instead points to the solution. Previously, the ribonuclease inhibitor protein was demonstrated to have no effect on the ribonucleolytic activity of microbial ribonucleases T1 and U1 (41Cho S. Joshi J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 175-179Google Scholar). In the conditions used herein, hRI was able to fully inactivate RNase A but had no effect on the activity of RNase Sa and Sa3, even at a 10-fold greater concentration. Thus, streptomycete ribonucleases Sa and Sa3 bind tightly to barstar (15Hartley R.W. Both V. Hebert E.J. Homerova D. Jucovic M. Nazarov V. Rybajlak I. Sevcik J. Protein Pept. Lett. 1996; 4: 225-231Google Scholar) but evade hRI. RNase Sa3 exhibits dose-dependent toxicity to K-562 cells as shown in Fig.4. The IC50 value for RNase Sa3 is (5 ± 1) μm, which is only 10-fold greater than that of onconase. In contrast to RNase Sa3, RNase Sa does not exhibit significant cytotoxic activity. Ribonucleases can be cytotoxic by virtue of their ribonucleolytic activity. The cytotoxic activity of some vertebrate ribonucleases has led to their development as cancer chemotherapeutics (42Youle R.J. D'Alessio G. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. Academic Press, New York1997: 491-514Google Scholar, 43Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 405-413Google Scholar, 44Matousek J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. C Toxicol. Pharmacol. 2001; 129: 175-191Google Scholar). For example, onconase, which is the homolog of RNase A in the Northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), is now in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of malignant mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer (45Mikulski S.M. Costanzi J.J. Vogelzang N.J. McCachren S. Taub R.N. Chun H. Mittelman A. Panella T. Puccio C. Fine R. Shogen K. J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 274-281Google Scholar). A few fungal ribonucleases are also known to have antitumor activity (46Wool I.G. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functionsv. Academic Press, New York1997: 131-162Google Scholar). Specifically, the Aspergillusribonucleases α-sarcin (47Pérez-Cañadillas J.M. Santoro J. Campos-Olivas R. Lacadena J. Martı́nez del Pozo A. Gavilanes J.G. Rico M. Bruix M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1061-1073Google Scholar), mitogillin (48Kao R. Davies J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12576-12582Google Scholar), restrictocin (49Yang X. Moffat K. Structure. 1996; 4: 837-852Google Scholar), and Asp-fl (50Madan T. Arora N. Sarma P.U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 175: 21-27Google Scholar) kill cells by cleaving a specific phosphodiester bond in 28 S rRNA, thereby disrupting the ribosome and impairing protein biosynthesis (51Schindler D.G. Davies J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 1097-1100Google Scholar). To our knowledge, RNase Sa3 is only the second prokaryotic ribonuclease to have demonstrable cytotoxic activity (63Ilinskaya O. Decker K. Koshinski A. Dreyer F. Repp H. Toxicology. 2001; 156: 101-107Google Scholar). The mechanism by which RNase Sa3 manifests its cytotoxicity is unclear but probably relies on its ribonucleolytic activity as does the cytotoxicity of other ribonucleases (52Kim J.-S. Soucek J. Matousek J. Raines R.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 547-550Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of RNase Sa3, which is highly similar to that of its non-toxic homolog RNase Sa (Fig.2 E), provides no obvious clues. Likewise, the conformational stability of the two ribonucleases, which can correlate with cytotoxicity (53Klink T.A. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17463-17467Google Scholar), is similar (11Pace C.N. Horn G. Hebert E.J. Bechert J. Shaw K. Urbanikova L. Scholtz J.M. Sevcik J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 393-404Google Scholar). However, the endogenous ability of RNase Sa3 to evade RI is reminiscent of that of onconase (28Wu Y. Mikulski S.M. Ardelt W. Rybak S.M. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10686-10693Google Scholar) and bovine seminal ribonuclease (54Murthy B.S. Sirdeshmukh R. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 343-348Google Scholar), two mammalian ribonucleases with cytotoxic activity. This ability is also probably critical for the cytotoxicity of RNase Sa3. Furthermore, RNase Sa3 is more cationic than is RNase Sa (pI = 5.4 and 3.5, respectively) (16Hebert E.J. Grimsley G.R. Hartley R.W. Horn G. Schell D. Garcia S. Both V. Sevcik J. Pace C.N. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 11: 162-168Google Scholar), and more cationic ribonucleases are more cytotoxic (55Futami J. Maeda T. Kitazoe M. Nukui E. Tada H. Seno M. Kosaka M. Yamada H. Biochemistry. 2001; 26: 7518-7524Google Scholar). Additional studies are necessary to reveal the basis as well as the mechanism of RNase Sa3 cytotoxicity. These studies are compelled by the need to develop new cytotoxins for use in cell biology and medicine (43Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 405-413Google Scholar, 56Rappuoli R.

However, the signaling mechanisms and structural consequences leading to impaired cardiomyocyte adhesion are poorly defined. These events were studied in tropomodulin-overexpressing transgenic mice that develop dilated cardiomyopathy associated with chronic elevation of intracellular calcium. Analysis of tropomodulin-overexpressing transgenic hearts by immunoblot and confocal microscopy revealed activation and redistribution of signaling molecules known to regulate adhesion. Calcium-dependent pyk2/related focal adhesion tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) showed changes in expression and phosphorylation state, similar to changes observed for a related downstream target molecule of pyk2/RAFTK termed focal adhesion kinase. Paxillin, the target substrate molecule for focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation, was redistributed in tropomodulin-overexpressing transgenic hearts with enhanced paxillin phosphorylation and cleavage. Certain aspects of the in vivo signaling phenotype including increased paxillin phosphorylation could be recapitulated in vitrousing neonatal rat cardiomyocytes infected with recombinant adenovirus to overexpress tropomodulin. In addition, increasing intracellular calcium levels with ionomycin induced pyk2/RAFTK phosphorylation, and adenovirally mediated expression of wild-type pyk2/RAFTK resulted in increased phospho-pyk2/RAFTK levels and concomitant paxillin phosphorylation. Collectively, these results delineate a cardiomyocyte signaling pathway associated with dilation that has potential relevance for cardiac remodeling, focal adhesion reorganization, and loss of contractility.

Collectively, these results delineate a cardiomyocyte signaling pathway associated with dilation that has potential relevance for cardiac remodeling, focal adhesion reorganization, and loss of contractility. Altered intracellular calcium handling is characteristic of heart failure, presumably as a compensatory mechanism to stimulate contractile function and signal transduction (1Beuckelmann D.J.

Chronic elevation of diastolic calcium level consequently activates calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways. Calcium-activated pathways regulate cardiac function, and disruption of calcium-responsive signaling has been associated with cardiomyopathic changes in experimental transgenic mouse models. Myocardium-specific transgenic overexpression of calcium-activated enzymes such as protein kinase C β2 (3Bowman J.C. Steinberg S.F. Jiang T. Geenen D.L. Fishman G.I. Buttrick P.M. J. Clin.

Calcineurin activation, hypertrophic remodeling, and elevation of intracellular calcium are associated with heart failure in a cardiomyopathic transgenic mouse model created by overexpression of tropomodulin (Tmod), 1The abbreviations used are: Tmod, tropomodulin; TOT, tropomodulin-overexpressing transgenic; NTG, nontransgenic; RAFTK, related focal adhesion tyrosine kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; β-gal, β-galactosidase.1The abbreviations used are: Tmod, tropomodulin; TOT, tropomodulin-overexpressing transgenic; NTG, nontransgenic; RAFTK, related focal adhesion tyrosine kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WT, wild type; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; β-gal, β-galactosidase. a regulatory component of the sarcomere (6Sussman M.A. Welch S.

Tmod-overexpressing transgenic (TOT) hearts are characterized by a combination of increased intracellular calcium levels, myofibril degeneration, loss of systolic function, and inability to hypertrophy. This constellation of features is reminiscent of degenerative changes associated with heart failure (1Beuckelmann D.J. Nabauer M. Erdmann E.

Circulation. 1991; 83: 504-514Google Scholar), making the TOT mouse a useful model for studying structural and signaling changes occurring in myocardial decompensation. TOT hearts dilate rapidly between postnatal days 9 and 12, increasing heart:body weight ratio ∼3-fold (6Sussman M.A. Welch S. Gude N. Khoury P.R. Daniels S.R. Kirkpatrick D. Walsh R.A. Price R.L. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 2101-2113Google Scholar). This profound enlargement requires substantial cardiomyocyte remodeling driven, in part, by signaling pathways regulating cytoskeletal organization. Activation of cytoskeletal reorganization likely contributes to development of dilation in TOT hearts, as marked changes in cardiomyocyte shape occur (9Welch S. Plank D. Witt S. Glascock B. Chimenti S. Andreoli A.M. Limana F. Leri A. Kajstura J. Anversa P. Sussman M.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 649-656Google Scholar) without the induction of typical genetic molecular markers usually associated with hypertrophic reprogramming (10Sussman M.A. Welch S. Cambon N. Klevitsky R. Hewett T. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 51-61Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal remodeling coupled with elevation of intracellular calcium level is associated with pyk2/RAFTK (abbreviations for proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 and related focal adhesion tyrosine kinase, respectively; also known as CADTK, CAKβ, or FAK2), a cytosolic calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase with high homology to p125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK; Refs. 11Li X. Dy R.C. Cance W.G. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8917-8924Google Scholar and 12Pandey P. Avraham S. Kumar S. Nakazawa A. Place A. Ghanem L. Rana A. Kumar V. Majumder P.K. Avraham H. Davis R.J. Kharbanda S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10140-10144Google Scholar). Elevation of intracellular calcium in TOT cardiomyocytes makes pyk2/RAFTK an ideal candidate molecule for initiating reorganization of focal adhesion contacts during the pathogenesis of dilation. Focal adhesions are macromolecular cytoskeletal structures that interface with integrins and are enriched for many molecules that serve roles in cytoskeletal architecture, signal transduction, or both. Although the pyk2/RAFTK expression and mechanisms of regulation have been extensively characterized in a variety of non-muscle (11Li X. Dy R.C. Cance W.G. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8917-8924Google Scholar, 12Pandey P. Avraham S. Kumar S. Nakazawa A. Place A. Ghanem L. Rana A. Kumar V. Majumder P.K. Avraham H. Davis R.J. Kharbanda S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1711-1718Google Scholar) cells and tissues, pyk2/RAFTK activity in normal or pathologically altered myocardium remains largely unexplored. Recent studies from Samarel and co-workers (14Bayer A.L. Ferguson A.G. Luchessi P.A. Samarel A.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 1017-1030Google Scholar) found pyk2/RAFTK concentration is much greater in neonatal than in adult ventricular tissue and cardiomyocytes, and pyk2/RAFTK expression is highly dependent on [Ca2+]i transients and contractility. In addition, pyk2/RAFTK expression level and phosphorylation were increased in a rat model of pressure overload cardiac hypertrophy (15Bayer A.L. Heidkamp M.C. Patel N. Porter M.J. Engman S.J. Samarel A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: H695-H706Google Scholar). Both pyk2/RAFTK and FAK appear to exert their cytoskeletal signaling effects through phosphorylation of paxillin, a multifunctional adapter molecule concentrated at focal adhesion structures (16Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Google Scholar). Regulation of adhesion has significant implications for cardiac function, because efficient force transmission depends in large part upon the integrity of connections between cardiomyocytes and the extracellular matrix. Structural reorganization, loss of contractility, and elevation of intracellular calcium in juvenile TOT hearts presumably combine to initiate focal adhesion complex remodeling in the dilating heart. To test this hypothesis, TOT hearts and primary cardiomyocyte cultures were examined for activation of pyk2/RAFTK and associated downstream signaling molecules involved in regulation of focal adhesion complexes. TOT mouse line and non-transgenic mice used in this study were created and bred as previously described (3Bowman J.C. Steinberg S.F. Jiang T. Geenen D.L. Fishman G.I. Buttrick P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2189-2195Google Scholar) and handled in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Phosphorylated sites on signaling proteins were detected using antibodies to pyk2/RAFTK (residue 402), FAK (residue 861), and paxillin (residue 31; all from BIOSOURCE-QCB, Camarillo, CA). Signaling molecules were also labeled using anti-pyk2/RAFTK and anti-paxillin monoclonal antibodies (both from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) or anti-FAK polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Structural proteins were labeled with anti-vinculin (Santa Cruz Technologies, Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-α-actinin (Sigma). Nuclei were labeled with propidium iodide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Primary antibodies were detected by fluorescently tagged secondary goat anti-mouse IgG, donkey anti-goat IgG, and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA). Ionomycin was obtained from Sigma. Cardiomyocytes were treated with 0.5 μm ionomycin for 25 min, washed twice in PBS, and processed to obtain a whole cell extract as described below. Sections were prepared from TOT and control mice hearts, which were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight at 4 °C. The next day, hearts were subjected to a progressive sucrose gradient from 10, 20, and 30% at 4 °C, waiting for equilibration of the heart with the sucrose solution at each step (approximately 1 h). Sucrose-infiltrated hearts were sectioned at a thickness of 8 μm and stained with antibodies for confocal microscopy as previously described (6Sussman M.A. Welch S. Gude N. Khoury P.R. Daniels S.R. Kirkpatrick D. Walsh R.A. Price R.L. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 2101-2113Google Scholar). Confocal micrographs presented were derived from tissue sections or cultured cells consisting of control and experimental samples that were prepared in parallel using the same reagents and subsequently scanned using identical magnification and settings for image acquisition and processing. Neonatal rat ventricular myocytes were isolated from hearts of 2–3-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats by multiple collagenase type II (Worthington, Lakewood, NJ) and pancreatine digestions as previously described (17Clerk A. Bogoyevitch M.A. Andersson M.B. Sudgen P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32848-32857Google Scholar). Myocytes were preplated for 2 h in M-199 plus 15% fetal bovine serum to reduce non-myocyte contamination and plated at various densities on either plastic chamber slides pretreated with laminin (Sigma) or 1% gelatin-coated dishes. Cultures were incubated until the following day, and then myocytes were washed and refed with maintenance medium (M-199 supplemented with 2% horse serum). Replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus mediating overexpression of Tmod has been previously described (6Sussman M.A. Welch S. Gude N. Khoury P.R. Daniels S.R. Kirkpatrick D. Walsh R.A. Price R.L. Lim H.W. Molkentin J.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 2101-2113Google Scholar, 10Sussman M.A. Welch S. Cambon N. Klevitsky R. Hewett T. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 51-61Google Scholar). Rat pyk2/RAFTK cDNA fragments encoding both wild type (pyk2/RAFTK-WT) and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (pyk2/RAFTK-Tyr402) were used to create replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses with the Ad Easy system (Microbix Biosystem Inc., Ontario, Canada) as directed by the manufacturer. The Tyr402 residue is the autophosphorylation site that also binds and activates Src. Mutation in this residue blocks autophosphorylation and binding of Src leading to abrogation of Src phosphorylation. Subconfluent cardiomyocyte cultures were infected with recombinant adenoviruses, including β-galactosidase-expressing adenovirus as a control, for 2 h at a multiplicity of infection of ∼50:1, and then medium was aspirated and replaced with maintenance medium. Lysates for biochemical analyses were prepared ∼24 h after infection. Analysis of protein content was performed using TOT and control hearts homogenized on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EGTA) in the presence of a mixture of protease (100 μm sodium orthovanadate and NaF, 10 μm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone) and phosphatase (10 nm each cypermethrin and okadaic acid and 100 μm phenylasine oxide) inhibitors. The homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C for 20 min to obtain clarified lysates. For preparing of lysates from cultured cells, cardiomyocytes were washed twice with PBS and lysed in the same extraction buffer used for heart homogenization and centrifuged in an identical manner prior to use in experiments. Tissue extracts and whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were probed with various primary antibodies as indicated and detected by enhanced chemifluorescence according to manufacturer protocols (AmershamBiosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The immunoprecipitated complexes, obtained by immunoprecipitating nontransgenic (NTG) hearts and TOT heart lysates with anti-RAFTK antibodies (1 mg/ml), were washed three times with lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (20 mmHepes (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 20 μm ATP). The kinase assay was initiated by incubating the immune complex in kinase buffer containing 25 mg of poly(Glu/Tyr) (4:1; 20–50 kDa; Sigma) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at room temperature for 30 min. Reactions were terminated and analyzed as described (18Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D. Li J. Jiang S. Pasztor L. White R. Groopman J. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27742-27751Google Scholar, 19Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1055-1063Google Scholar, 20Koziak K. Kaczmarek E. Park S.Y. Fu Y. Avraham S. Avraham H. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 114: 134-140Google Scholar). Each band was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) signal intensity. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean. Student'st test was used for statistical comparisons. Differences among means were considered significant at p ≤ 0.01. Hearts from nontransgenic control and TOT mice were compared by immunoblot analysis to determine total pyk2/RAFTK protein content. Labeling of SDS-PAGE separated lysates showed the pyk2/RAFTK content of TOT hearts was increased ∼2.4-fold compared with control animals (Fig. 1). Repeated experiments using multiple heart lysates from individual TOTs showed pyk2/RAFTK levels were consistently elevated in samples from TOTs with high heart:body weight (mg/g) ratios (over 10:1). Phosphorylation of pyk2/RAFTK was detected using antibody that recognized phosphotyrosine at position 402 (phospho-pyk402), indicative of activation (11Li X. Dy R.C. Cance W.G. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8917-8924Google Scholar). Phospho-pyk2/RAFTK402 immunoreactivity was increased 1.8-fold in TOT samples versus normal controls (Fig. 1). Thus, pyk2/RAFTK accumulation and activation is associated with TOT cardiac pathogenesis. Confocal microscopy was performed to identify phospho-pyk2/RAFTK402signaling in histologic sections from TOT hearts and controls (Fig. 1). Experiments performed with anti-phospho-pyk881 (data not shown) yielded results comparable with findings with anti-phospho-pyk402. Analysis of sections from control nontransgenic hearts showed minimal reactivity with anti-phospho-pyk402 (Fig. 1, A andC), consistent with immunoblot and previous results indicating low pyk2/RAFTK protein level in these hearts. In contrast, TOT sections showed marked phospho-pyk402 labeling, often in a perinuclear distribution (Fig. 1, B and D,arrows) as has been previously observed for pyk2/RAFTK immunolocalization (21Sieg D.J. Ilic D. Jones K.C. Damsky C.H. Hunter T. Schlaepfer D.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5933-5947Google Scholar). Closer examination revealed that activation of pyk2/RAFTK was focused in cardiomyocytes showing an increased anti-phospho-pyk402 labeling relative to nontransgenic control cells (Fig. 1, E–G). Additional examination revealed phospho-pyk402 was distributed in a faint striated pattern parallel with myofibrils localized between Z-discs in the I-band (Fig. 1 F, inset, at arrows). Therefore, pyk2/RAFTK is activated in TOT hearts within cardiomyocytes, where the activated kinase distribution may be compartmentalized in relation to sarcomeric structures. As FAK is a related member of pyk2/RAFTK kinase (11Li X. Dy R.C. Cance W.G. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8917-8924Google Scholar) that is associated with focal adhesion complex structures (22Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Google Scholar), hearts from nontransgenic control and TOT mice were compared by immunoblot analysis to determine total protein content and phosphorylation pattern of FAK. FAK content was increased 1.8-fold in TOT animals compared with controls (Fig.2). Activation of FAK was assessed in TOT hearts using antibody that recognized phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue at position 861 (phospho-FAK861) indicative of FAK activity (23Calalb M.B. Zhang X. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 662-668Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of lysates with anti-FAK antibody showed a significant increase of 2.9-fold in phospho-FAK861levels in TOT mice compared with nontransgenic animals (Fig. 2). This increase was also correlated with a change in phospho-FAK861 distribution in same samples. Rather than the patchy, diffuse pattern observed in control sections (Fig.2 A), phospho-FAK861 reactivity in TOT sections was enriched in threads of non-uniform labeling, which appeared to lie between adjacent cells (Fig. 2 B). Many areas of phospho-FAK861 reactivity in the TOT sections colocalized with focal adhesion complexes identified with antibody to paxillin (Fig. 2, C and D, at arrows). Specificity of the anti-phospho-FAK861 antibody was demonstrated by peptide competition experiments (Fig. 2,E–H). As pyk2/RAFTK distribution, redistribution of activated FAK was associated to cardiomyocytes of TOT hearts, where the activated kinase may be targeted to focal adhesion complexes. Results indicating activation of pyk2/RAFTK and FAK in TOT hearts (Figs. 1 and 2) was confirmed by in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3). Lysates from individual nontransgenic control (n = 5) or TOT (n= 5) hearts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against either pyk2/RAFTK or FAK. Phosphorylation of target substrate by the immunoprecipitated kinase was quantitated, and -fold increases were calculated relative to immunoprecipitation with control irrelevant antibody. Results show a 4.1 ± 0.24-fold increase in pyk2/RAFTK activity and a 2.5 ± 0.24-fold increase in FAK activity relative to the comparably prepared nontransgenic samples. Kinase activity differences between the TOT and the comparably prepared nontransgenic samples were highly significant (p < 0.005). These results confirm elevation of pyk2/RAFTK kinase activity in the remodeling TOT myocardium. Paxillin is a direct phosphorylation target of FAK and pyk2/RAFTK that participates in regulation of focal adhesion structure based, in part, upon phosphorylation state (22Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1100Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of paxillin was assessed in TOT hearts using antibody against phosphotyrosine residue 31 (phospho-paxillin31) because this residue is a target for FAK-mediated phosphorylation (24Bellis S.L. Miller J.T. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17437-17441Google Scholar). The location of paxillin on the blot at the appropriate mobility of 68 kDa was visualized by using a positive control signal from a cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocyte lysate that overexpressed adenovirally encoded paxillin (Fig. 4, +). Immunoblot analysis of pan-paxillin between nontransgenic control and TOT showed comparable paxillin levels (Fig. 4, left side, -fold difference = 1.03 ± 0.1). However, significantly increased immunoreactivity with a smaller 38-kDa phosphopolypeptide is present in both positive control cell lysate (+) and TOT samples relative to nontransgenic hearts (Fig. 4, right side, -fold increase = 1.83 ± 0.2,p = 0.01). This polypeptide, which also labels with the pan-paxillin antibody (Fig. 4, left side), probably represents a cleaved paxillin fragment (25Chay K.-O. Park S.S. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14521-14529Google Scholar, 26Carragher N.O. Levkau B. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; : 619-629Google Scholar) in the failing heart. Another related phosphopolypeptide with higher mobility (∼50 kDa) was detected the heart lysates but not in the positive control (+) sample (Fig. 4, right side), so the significance of this cross-reactive polypeptide remains unclear although immunoreactivity parallels the increases observed for the 38-kDa phospho-paxillin31 fragment. Confocal analysis showed that distribution of phospho-paxillin31 was markedly altered in TOT sections. Patchy labeling observed in nontransgenic control sections (Fig. 4 B) lacked the pronounced striations of phospho-paxillin31 reactivity apparent in TOT sections (Fig. 4 C). These myofibril-like patterns of anti-phospho-paxillin31 showed varying degrees of disorganization, probably related to the degeneration of myofibril structure concurrent with development of dilation in TOT cardiomyocytes (10Sussman M.A. Welch S. Cambon N. Klevitsky R. Hewett T. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 51-61Google Scholar). Accumulation of another protein belonging to focal adhesion complexes, vinculin, was also found with increased expression in TOT lysates compared with nontransgenic samples (data not shown). Thus, phospho-paxillin31 reactivity is increased in TOT hearts and shows altered distribution, suggesting changes in focal adhesion complex signaling in these dilated hearts. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were infected with recombinant adenoviruses to determine whether overexpression of Tmod can mimic the observed in vivo phenotype in terms of content and activation of pyk2/RAFTK, FAK, paxillin, and vinculin. Cultures were infected with adenoviruses expressing Tmod or β-gal as a control and then processed for immunoblot analysis or confocal microscopy. Tmod expression in the soluble fraction was increased 3.9-fold following adenoviral expression as measured by immunoblot analysis (data not shown), demonstrating efficient expression of the virally encoded protein. In contrast to myocardial samples, total content and activation level of pyk2/RAFTK or FAK were unaffected by Tmod expression relative to either β-gal-infected cultures or whole cell extracts from non-infected cardiomyocytes (data not shown). However, immunoblot analyses showed increased immunoreactivity for phospho-paxillin31 and vinculin compared with β-gal or non-infected cells (Fig. 5 A). As was found in vivo, increased changes were not correlated to elevation of total paxillin content (data not shown). Quantitation of these increases by immunoblot analysis demonstrated a 3.1-fold elevation of phospho-paxillin31 and a 1.7-fold increase in vinculin content resulting from Tmod overexpression relative to β-gal infection (Fig. 5 A). The distribution of the focal adhesion component proteins phospho-paxillin31 and vinculin was also determined by confocal microscopy of cultured cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5 B). Increased staining for both phospho-paxillin31 and vinculin was evident after Tmod expression (Fig. 5 B,bottom row), as would be expected based upon immunoblot results (Fig. 5 A). Immunolocalization showed each protein was coincident with α-actinin, which labeled myofibril Z-discs with similar intensity in cultures that were uninfected (Fig.5 B, top row), infected with virus expressing β-galactosidase (middle row), or infected with virus expressing Tmod (bottom row). These results demonstrate that both phospho-paxillin31 and vinculin accumulate in the region of the Z-disc where structures analogous to focal adhesions, called costameres, are concentrated. Collectively, these in vitro experiments demonstrate that Tmod overexpression induces certain phenotypic changes similar to those observed in TOT heart in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes, at least related to two proteins associated with focal adhesion complex organization. Moreover, these results indicate that accumulation of Tmod alone does not lead to a generalized activation of kinase pathways associated with adhesion remodeling, suggesting that the activation observed in TOT myocardial samples is related to cardiac dilation and heart failure. This discrepancy between the in vivo andin vitro activation of pyk2/RAFTK following Tmod overexpression is likely caused by elevated calcium levels in the TOT mouse cardiomyocytes (9Welch S. Plank D. Witt S. Glascock B. Chimenti S. Andreoli A.M. Limana F. Leri A. Kajstura J. Anversa P. Sussman M.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 649-656Google Scholar). The TOT phenotype is associated with elevation of intracellular calcium that could account for the activation of the calcium-dependent pyk2/RAFTK kinase. To test this hypothesis in vitro, cultured cardiomyocytes were treated with calcium ionophore for 25 min and phospho-pyk402 levels were assessed by immunoblot. Increased phospho-pyk402 level was found in those cardiomyocytes treated with 0.5 μm ionomycin (Fig.6). This calcium-mediated activation of pyk2/RAFTK was not affected by accumulation of adenovirally overexpressed Tmod. These results indicate that pyk2/RAFTK activation can be mediated by elevation of intracellular calcium concentration in cardiomyocytes and also demonstrate that Tmod accumulation alone does not promote calcium-mediated signal transduction. Because pyk2/RAFTK-mediated signaling is activated in TOT hearts (Fig. 1), the effect of increased pyk2/RAFTK signaling in cardiomyocytes was examined using recombinant adenoviruses expressing either pyk2/RAFTK-WT or a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (pyk2/RAFTK-Tyr402). Immunoblot analyses demonstrate that a modest level of pyk2/RAFTK immunoreactivity found in uninfected or β-gal-expressing cardiomyocytes is dramatically increased by infection with adenoviruses encoding either pyk2/RAFTK-WT or pyk2/RAFTK-Tyr402 (Fig. 7). Infection with the pyk2/RAFTK-WT leads to increased levels of both phospho-pyk2/RAFTK402 and phospho-paxillin31, whereas accumulation of pyk2/RAFTK-Tyr402 has no effect on phosphorylation state of either protein. Interestingly, overexpression of pyk2/RAFTK-WT diminished the level of total paxillin present in the lysates without affecting total FAK expression, suggesting that pyk2/RAFTK-mediated phosphorylation could play a role in regulation o"
https://openalex.org/W2044699982,"The leader proteinase (Lpro) of foot and mouth disease virus is a papain-like cysteine proteinase. After processing itself from the polyprotein, Lpro then cleaves the host protein eukaryotic initiation factor (eIf) 4GI, thus preventing protein synthesis from capped mRNA in the infected cell. We have investigated Lpro interaction with eIF4GI and its isoform, eIF4GII. Lpro, expressed as a catalytically inactive fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, binds specifically to eIF4G isomers in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Deletion and specific mutagenesis were used to map the binding domain on Lpro to residues 183–195 of the C-terminal extension and to residue Cys133. These residues of the C-terminal extension and Cys133 are adjacent in the crystal structure but lie about 25 Å from the active site. The region on eIF4GI recognized by the Lpro C-terminal extension was mapped to residues 640–669 using eIF4GI fragments generated by proteolysis or byin vitro translation. The Lpro cleavage site at Gly674↓Arg675 was not necessary for binding. Similar experiments with human rhinovirus 2A proteinase (2Apro), a chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinase that also cleaves eIF4G isoforms, revealed that 2Apro can also bind to eIF4GI fragments lacking its cleavage site. These experiments strongly suggest a novel interaction between picornaviral proteinases and eIF4G isoforms.

These factors comprise the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A, the RNA-binding protein eIF4B and a scaffold protein that occurs in two isoforms, eIF4GI and eIF4GII (2Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). In mammalian systems, eIF4E, eIF4A, and eIF4G can be isolated as a complex designated eIF4F. eIF4F together with eIF4B and eIF3 recognizes the cap structure at the 5′ end of the cellular mRNA, unwinds RNA secondary structure in an ATP-dependent manner, and enables binding of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA (3Pain V.M.

During the replication of certain picornaviruses such as FMDV, HRV, and PV, translation of capped cellular mRNA in the infected cell is shut down by specific cleavage of the eIF4G isoforms (8Kräusslich H.G.

Initiation of protein synthesis from viral mRNA is unaffected because it initiates internally and does not require a cap structure (12Jackson R.J. Howell M.T. Kaminski A. Trends Biochem.

Substantial genetic evidence shows that the papain-like Lpro of FMDV and the chymotrypsin-like 2Apro of HRVs and enteroviruses cleave eIF4G isoforms in vivo, thus preventing recruitment of capped mRNA to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (15Bernstein H.D.

Using purified eIF4F or recombinant eIF4E and eIF4G and recombinant proteinases, several groups demonstrated that eIF4G can be cleaved directly in vitro (19Liebig H.-D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K.

Virology. 1998; 245: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the eIF4G·eIF4E complex was shown to be a better substrate for HRV 2Apro than eIF4G alone (23Haghighat A. Svitkin Y. Novoa I. Kuechler E. Skern T. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8444-8450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The availability of eIF4E is also important for Lpro cleavage of eIF4GI; the addition of the eIF4E-binding protein (eIF4E-BP1) to a cleavage reaction rendered the eIF4GI refractory to Lpro cleavage (24Ohlmann T. Pain V.M. Wood W. Rau M. Morley S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 844-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purification of in vitro cleavage products has allowed the determination of the Lpro cleavage site to be between Gly674 and Arg675; in contrast, rhino- and enterovirus 2Apro cleave between Arg681 and Gly682 (20Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Lamphear B.J. Yan R.

Biol. 2002; 22: 4499-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Generally, the proteinase concentration present in the infected cell at the time of eIF4G cleavage is much lower than the amount of Lpro or 2Apro required for eIF4G cleavagein vitro (20Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E. Skern T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5677-5684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bovee M.L.

Virol. 2000; 74: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This has led to the suggestion that the picornaviral proteinases may activate latent cellular proteinases which then amplify the response (29Lloyd R.E. Toyoda H. Etchinson D. Wimmer E. Ehrenfeld E. Virology. 1986; 150: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 30Wyckoff E.E. Lloyd R.E. Ehrenfeld E. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2943-2951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This view has been strengthened at least for PV by the observation that the majority of the eIF4GI-cleaving activity isolated from infected cells does not appear to co-purify with 2Apro-containing fractions (31Bovee M.L. Marissen W.E. Zamora M. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1998; 245: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, recent work seems to indicate that the majority of eIF4GI cleavage in PV-infected cells is indeed performed by 2Apro(26Zamora M. Marissen W.E. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A further level of complexity has recently been introduced into the eIF4G cleavage reaction. eIF4GI and eIF4GII are cleaved at different rates in cells infected by PV or HRV14 (32Gradi A. Svitkin Y.V. Imataka H. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11089-11094Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 33Svitkin Y.V. Gradi A. Imataka H. Morino S. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 3467-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); during infection with HRV2, however, the isoforms are cleaved simultaneously (34Seipelt J. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Gerner C. Kuechler E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20084-20089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The reasons for the molecular basis behind this difference remain unclear. We have recently developed an RRL system in which FMDV Lproor HRV 2Apro cleave eIF4GI at concentrations at those found during infection (35Glaser W. Skern T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We also showed that deletion of the 18-amino acid CTE of FMDV Lpro, which lies 25 Å or more from the active site, significantly reduced eIF4GI cleavage (36Glaser W. Cencic R. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35473-35481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, processing of the viral polyprotein cleavage site presented on a substrate in trans remained unaffected. This suggested that the CTE either stabilizes a conformation of Lpro necessary for eIF4GI cleavage or that it is involved in a direct recognition of eIF4GI. Here, we show that the CTE of FMDV Lpro is indeed part of a domain away from the active site that directly recognizes eIF4GI and define the region recognized by the CTE on eIF4GI to be distinct from that cleaved by Lpro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HRV2 2Apro can also bind directly to eIF4GI, again at a site away from the amino acids between which it cleaves. Plasmid LbproVP4VP2, which encodes FMDV amino acids 29–364 corresponding to the Lbpro (37Medina M. Domingo E. Brangwyn J.K. Belsham G.J. Virology. 1993; 194: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) form of Lpro (29–201), VP4 (202–286), and part of VP2 (287–364) has been described (36Glaser W. Cencic R. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35473-35481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Fragments encoding HRV2 2Apro were amplified from nucleotides 3173–3586 of the HRV2 cDNA (19Liebig H.-D. Ziegler E. Yan R. Hartmuth K. Klump H. Kowalski H. Blaas D., W., S. Frasel L. Lamphear B. Rhoads R. Kuechler E. Skern T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7581-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The deletions and mutations of Lbproand 2Apro were generated by standard PCR mutagenesis and introduced as EcoRI/XhoI fragments into the plasmid pGEX5X (Amersham Biosciences) as required. Fragments of eIF4GI for in vitro translation were amplified from plasmid pSKHC1 (38Yan R.Q. Rychlik W. Etchison D. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23226-23231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains the entire eIF4GI cDNA, and cloned as EcoRI/HincII fragments into pBluescriptKS (Stratagene). Rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against either the N terminus (kindly provided by R. Rhoads) or the C terminus (kindly provided by A. Gradi) of eIF4GI were diluted 1:8000 and 1:1000, respectively; a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (also from A. Gradi) against the C terminus of eIF4GII was diluted 1:1000. The mouse monoclonal antibody against eIF4E (Transduction Laboratories) was diluted 1:500. Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were diluted 1:10,000 (Bio-Rad). Escherichia coli JM101 or BL21 cells were transformed with plasmids encoding the GST-Lbpro and GST-2Apro fusion proteins or GST alone. To express GST-Lbpro, an overnight culture was diluted 1:10 in 50 ml of medium, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 2 μm, and the cells were incubated at 30 °C for 3 h. For GST-2Apro the overnight culture was diluted 1:10 in 250 ml of medium, the cells were incubated to an A 600 of 0.8 and induced for 3 h at 18 °C by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.3 μm. The respective proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose resin (Amersham Biosciences) using standard techniques. Glutathione-Sepharose beads coated with GST fusion proteins were incubated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) with either an aliquot (8 μl) of RRL or with radiolabeled in vitro translated proteins for 2 h at 4 °C. After three washes with binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE-loading buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Western blotting (using enhanced chemiluminescence system of Pierce for detection) or fluorography. In vitro expression of radiolabeled proteins for GST pull-down assays was performed in RRLs (Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation system; Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine (20 μCi/reaction; Hartmann Analytic, Germany). Labeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films. In vitrotranslations in RRLs (Promega) to examine Lbproself-processing and eIF4GI cleavage were performed using in vitro transcribed RNAs as described (35Glaser W. Skern T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Glaser W. Cencic R. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35473-35481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). FMDV Lpro is the first protein encoded on the polyprotein. Because protein synthesis on the FMDV RNA can initiate at 1 of 2 AUG codons lying 84 nucleotides apart, two forms of Lpro, designated Labpro and Lbpro, are synthesized (39Sangar D.V. Newton S.E. Rowlands D.J. Clarke B.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3305-3315Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); these forms have the same enzymatic properties (37Medina M. Domingo E. Brangwyn J.K. Belsham G.J. Virology. 1993; 194: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All work described here was performed with the shorter Lbpro (FMDV amino acids 29–201). Cleavage of eIF4GI by Lbpro both in vivo andin vitro is highly efficient (20Kirchweger R. Ziegler E. Lamphear B.J. Waters D. Liebig H.D. Sommergruber W. Sobrino F. Hohenadl C. Blaas D. Rhoads R.E.

Biochem. 1992; 207: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of this reaction further, we decided to examine whether a GST-Lbpro fusion protein could bind to the eIF4G isoforms present in an RRL. To construct this fusion protein (GST-LbproC51A), we used an inactive Lbpromutant in which the active site cysteine residue had been replaced by an alanine residue (41Ziegler E. Borman A.M. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Kean K.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3465-3474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus preventing cleavage of the eIF4G isoforms during the experiment. GST-LbproC51A was bound to glutathione-coupled Sepharose (the purity of the GST-LbproC51A fusion protein is shown in Fig.2 A, lane 2) and incubated with RRL as a source of eIF4G isomers. After washing, proteins bound to GST-LbproC51A were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2, B–D). eIF4GI and eIF4GII, which migrate as a series of bands with a relative molecular mass of about 220 kDa (11Gradi A. Imataka H. Svitkin Y.V. Rom E. Raught B. Morino S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 42Etchison D. Milburn S.C. Edery I. Sonenberg N. Hershy J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14806-15810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are retained by the GST-LbproC51A fusion (Fig. 2, B andC, lanes 3). About 20–25% of the eIF4GI in the RRL aliquot was present in the bound fraction. Furthermore, the 25 kDa eIF4E protein, which forms a complex with the eIF4G isomers (43Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N. Y.1996: 245-270Google Scholar), was found in this fraction as well (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). No binding of these proteins was observed to the GST protein alone (Fig. 2, B–D, lanes 2). As can be seen in Fig.3, Lbpro possesses the typical two domain α-helix/β-sheet fold of a papain proteinase. In addition, Lbpro is unique in having an 18-amino acid CTE (44Guarné A. Tormo J. Kirchweger K. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); removal of this region has been demonstrated to delay cleavage of eIF4GI without affecting cleavage of the viral polyprotein sequence presented in trans (36Glaser W. Cencic R. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35473-35481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the CTE was responsible for Lbpro binding of eIF4GI. Thus, we expressed GST-LbproC51A fusions carrying different CTE deletions and examined their ability to bind eIF4GI (Fig.4). eIF4GI is still retained by an Lbpro lacking residues 196–201 (LbproC51A-6; Fig. 4 B, lane 3); Lbpro-6 cleaves eIF4GI at wild-type levels (36Glaser W. Cencic R. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35473-35481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Binding is, however, almost completely abolished by removal of the entire CTE (residues 183–201, LbproC51A-18; Fig. 4 B, lane 4); Lbpro-18 was significantly delayed in eIF4GI cleavage (36Glaser W. Cencic R. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35473-35481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, no binding whatsoever was observed using a mutant with an unrelated sequence in the CTE (GST-Lb pro C51A CTE*, Fig. 4 B, lane 5), which was severely delayed in eIF4GI cleavage (36Glaser W. Cencic R. Skern T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35473-35481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, amino acids 183–195 of Lbpro are necessary for the interaction with eIF4GI. However, they are not sufficient, because a GST fusion protein bearing just the residues 183–195 did not bind eIF4GI (data not shown). This implied that another part of the Lbpro was also required for interaction with eIF4GI. Examination of the Lbpro structure (Fig. 3) showed that the loop between β-sheets 4 and 5 was close to the residues at the beginning of the CTE. Moreover, this loop contains the residue Cys133, which was observed to form an intermolecular disulfide bridge with a neighboring molecule in the protein crystal of Lbpro (44Guarné A. Tormo J. Kirchweger K. Pfistermueller D. Fita I. Skern T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7469-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that it was unusually reactive and, thus, perhaps important for Lbpro function. To test whether Cys133 was also involved in binding and cleaving eIF4GI, we substituted Cys133 with serine (this does not affect the structure of the enzyme (45Guarné A. Hampoelz B. Glaser W. Carpena X. Tormo J. Fita I. Skern T. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1227-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)) and first examined the ability of this mutant to carry out self-processing at the Lbpro/VP4 junction and eIF4GI cleavage. This mutant performs self-processing (i.e. intramolecular cleavage) at wild-type levels, because no uncleaved material was observed with either wild-type or mutant enzyme (Fig. 5 A). In addition, this mutant also carries out intermolecular cleavage at the viral polyprotein cleavage site with essentially identical kinetics to those of the wild type (data not shown). However, the ability of the C133S mutant to cleave eIF4GI was clearly impaired (Fig. 5 B, compare the wild-type and mutant panels). 50% cleavage of eIF4GI was observed between 4 and 8 min with the wild-type enzyme; with the mutant enzyme, 50% cleavage was not seen until 30 min. Correspondingly, the ability of this mutant to bind eIF4GI was reduced to that of the mutant lacking 18 amino acids in the CTE (compare Fig. 5 D, lane 3, with Fig.4 B, lane 4), suggesting that replacement of Cys133 had severely impaired the ability of Lbpro to bind eIF4GI and had, thus, retarded cleavage. However, the ability of the mutant to self-process at wild-type levels indicates that its overall structure was intact and the active site was fully functional. Thus, the recognition of the two known substrates of Lbpro, namely the Lbpro/VP4 junction in the polyprotein and eIF4GI, involve different parts of the protein. To identify the region on eIF4GI recognized by the CTE/Cys133 domain of Lbpro, we first cleaved eIF4GI proteolytically into the cleavage products by translating active Lbpro in RRLs (Fig. 6,A–C). The ability of the GST-LbproC51A fusion protein to bind the cleavage products was then examined as described above. The N-terminal cleavage product (cpN, Fig.6 B, lane 2) was retained on the GST-LbproC51A-Sepharose (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). Once again, eIF4E was also bound (data not shown). In contrast, no binding of the C-terminal cleavage product (cpC) was observed (Fig. 6 C, lane 4). Because the affinity of the anti-cpC antiserum appeared low, we repeated the experiment using three times as much Lbpro-treated RRL; nevertheless, cpC was still not detectable (data not shown). Thus, these results imply a direct interaction between Lbpro and cpN (residues 1–674). To further define the binding site on eIF4GI recognized by the Lbpro CTE/Cys133 domain, we synthesized a deletion of cpN containing amino acids 260–674 (Fig.6 A), expressed it in an RRL using [35S]methionine as radioactive label, and incubated the RRL containing the labeled protein with GST-LbproC51A coupled to glutathione-Sepharose. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were subjected to fluorography. This protein, encompassing amino acids 260–674 (Fig. 6 D), was retained by the GST-LbproC51A fusion protein. Next, we synthesized a 6-amino acid C-terminal deletion of cpN, 260–669, thus removing the amino acids that comprise the N-terminal part of the Lbpro cleavage site on eIF4GI. Nevertheless, this protein was retained by the GST-LbproC51A fusion protein (Fig. 6 E). In contrast, the fragment 260–640 (Fig.6 F), which terminates 34 amino acids from the cleavage site, was not bound. Thus, the Lbpro CTE/Cys133recognition domain lies between amino acids 640 and 669 of eIF4GI. The eIF4GI fragments shown in Fig. 6, D–F, were all capable of binding to eIF4E (data not shown), demonstrating that they were not incorrectly folded in any way. Ohlmann et al. (24Ohlmann T. Pain V.M. Wood W. Rau M. Morley S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 844-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) show that Lbpro can only cleave eIF4GI when eIF4E is available for binding. Therefore, we investigated whether eIF4E could modulate binding of the eIF4GI fragments. To this end, we synthesized a series of N-terminal deletions of cpN (Fig.7 A). All of the fragments were bound by the GST-LbproC51A fusion protein (Fig. 7,B–D) even though the eIF4GI fragment from amino acid 640 to 820 lacks the eIF4E binding site (609–623 (46Marcotrigiano J. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 47Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4900-4997Crossref Google Scholar)). However, the retention of this fragment, which was extended relative to the others to enable it to be resolved by SDS-PAGE, was significantly reduced compared with the two fragments containing the eIF4E binding site. The 2Apro of entero- and rhinoviruses, chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteinases structurally unrelated to Lbpro, also cleave the eIF4G isoforms. Thus, we investigated whether the HRV2 2Aprocould bind these isoforms in a similar manner to Lbpro(Fig. 8). Accordingly, we generated a GST-2AproC106A fusion protein (Fig. 8 A) that was again inactivated through the replacement of the active site cysteine by an alanine. Fig. 8 B shows that the 2Aprofusion protein could also bind eIF4GI. Once again, eIF4E was found in the bound material (Fig. 8C). The eIF4GII isoform was also bound by GST-2AproC106A (data not shown). The region on eIF4GI recognized by HRV2 2Apro was examined by once again using an active Lbpro to generate the cleavage products of eIF4GI (Fig. 9,A and B). We again observed that GST-2AproC106A also retained cpN (Fig.9 B) but not cpC (data not shown). That Lbpro cleaves eIF4GI between Gly674 and Arg675, 7 amino acids N-terminal from the 2Aprocleavage site between Arg681 and Gly682, indicates the 2Apro is also not simply binding eIF4GI at its cleavage site. To investigate whether 2Apro recognized the same amino acids as Lbpro, we carried out pull-down experiments using deletions of eIF4GI expressed in RRLs. The 2Apro fusion protein retained the deletion 260–674 (Fig.9 C) but failed to retain the deletions 260–669 or 260–674 (Fig. 9, D and E). This is in contrast to the Lbpro fusion, which also retained the eIF4GI fragment 260–669 (Fig. 6 E). This indicates that the binding sites of the two proteinases are similar but not identical and suggests an important role for eIF4GI amino acids 669–674 for recognition by HRV2 2Apro. The efficient cleavage of eIF4GI during picornaviral infection is an important determinant of virulence. Deletion of the Lpro-coding sequence from FMDV leads to an attenuated phenotype in vivo (16Brown C.C. Piccone M.E. Mason P.W. McKenna T.S. Grubman M.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5638-5641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); an attenuated strain of SVDV, an enterovirus closely related to coxsackievirus B5, has been described in which the 2Apro can carry out self-processing but is hampered in its ability to process eIF4GI (17Sakoda Y. Ross-Smith N. Inoue T. Belsham G.J. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10643-10650Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Kanno T. Mackay D. Wilsden G. Kitching P. Virus Res. 2001; 80: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, the understanding of the interaction between picornaviral proteinases and the eIF4G isoforms is crucial to an understanding of picornaviral virulence. The data presented here indicate that cleavage of eIF4GI by Lbpro or 2Apro is a multi-step reaction that is more complex than a simple recognition by the enzymes of their respective cleavage sites. Instead, the first step in the reaction appears to be proteinase binding to a distinct domain on eIF4GI separate from the amino acids at the respective cleavage sites on eIF4GI. Furthermore, for the Lbpro at least, we have shown that the active site of the enzyme is not involved in the initial recognition of eIF4GI. Nevertheless, this binding reaction appears to promote cleavage, presumably by bringing the catalytic site into close proximity of the cleavage site. After cleavage, Lbpro or 2Apro must be released from the N-terminal cleavage product to be able to process further eIF4GI molecules. This release of the enzyme may be driven, initially at least, by the low concentration of the eIF4GI cpN/Lbpro species. Furthermore, the fact that not all the eIF4GI was bound in the pull-down experiments indicates that binding is reversible. Thus, the existence of an eIF4GI binding domain on Lbpro, which is separate from the active site of the enzyme, would appear to be a major factor in promoting efficient cleavage of eIF4GI at low concentrations of enzyme. The experiments described here were all performed in RRLs. Thus, it might be argued that the interaction between the proteinases and the eIF4G isomers are not direct but may be mediated by RNA or a bridging protein. The RRLs were all previously treated with micrococcal nuclease, which would argue against the involvement of RNA. We have also repeated some of these experiments using a nuclease-treated S30E. coli extract; binding was observed in the presence of eIF4E between the GST-LbproC51A fusion protein and in vitro translated eIF4GI fragments. This argues against a bridging protein, because it seems unlikely that such a specific protein is conserved between mammals and bacteria. How do the CTE of Lbpro and residue Cys133 act together to form the eIF4GI binding domain? The side chains of Cys133 and Leu188 from the CTE are within 8.5 Å, indicating that they, together with other residues of the CTE and the β4-β5 loop (Fig. 3), could bind to a single domain on eIF4GI between residues 640 and 669. It is of interest that Cys133is conserved in all FMDV sequences so far available, except for a number of recently isolated FMDV serotypes from East and South Africa (48van Rensburg H. Haydon D. Joubert F. Bastos A. Heath L. Nel L. Gene. 2002; 289: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In these strains, threonine is found at residue 133; serine has not been described. It will be of interest to examine the eIF4G cleavage behavior of these serotypes. The CTE represents the most divergent part of Lbpro in terms of sequence and structure. Nevertheless, it appears to be playing a major role in substrate binding and specificity; moreover, it is noteworthy that this region is completely absent in papain, the prototype enzyme of the family of cysteine proteinases. Papain does not produce defined cleavage fragments of eIF4GI. 2B. Hampoelz and T. Skern, unpublished data. Ohlmann et al. (24Ohlmann T. Pain V.M. Wood W. Rau M. Morley S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 844-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have previously proposed that the substrate for Lbpro is the eIF4GI·eIF4E complex. They observed that the addition of the eIF4E-binding protein eIF4E-BP1 before the addition of Lbpro prevented cleavage of eIF4GI, presumably because the eIF4GI·eIF4E complex could not be formed. For HRV2 2Apro, Haghighat et al. (23Haghighat A. Svitkin Y. Novoa I. Kuechler E. Skern T. Sonenberg N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8444-8450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrate using purified recombinant proteins that the eIF4G·4E complex was cleaved much more efficiently than eIF4GI alone. The addition of exogenous eIF4E to a molar ratio of 4:1 increased the cleavage efficiency by at least 50-fold. Moreover, biochemical and genetic data have been obtained showing that yeast eIF4GI undergoes an unfolded to folded transition on binding eIF4E (49Hershey P.E. McWhirter S.M. Gross J.D. Wagner G. Alber T. Sachs A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21297-21304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) as suggested previously by Ohlmann et al. (24Ohlmann T. Pain V.M. Wood W. Rau M. Morley S.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 844-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This may be one of the reasons why the eIF4G·4E complex is the preferred substrate for picornaviral proteinases. It was thus surprising that Lbprowas able, albeit weakly, to bind the eIF4GI fragment 640–820, which does not contain the eIF4E binding site. This discrepancy can be explained by proposing that amino acids 640–669 in full-length eIF4GI must attain a particular conformation to be recognized by Lbpro. This conformation can apparently be achieved by the small fragment of amino acids 640–820 alone; the apparently weaker binding of this fragment indeed suggests that it is not all in the correct conformation for Lbpro recognition. However, in the 1600- amino acid full-length eIF4GI molecule, binding of eIF4E may substantially increase binding and cleavage by Lbpro. The binding interaction between HRV2 2Apro and eIF4GI illustrates that the recognition of a specific binding site distinct from the cleavage is not restricted to the FMDV Lbpro. Nevertheless, the binding sites are not identical; the HRV2 2Apro site extends to include eIF4GI amino acid 674, whereas the C-terminal boundary of the Lbpro site was defined as amino acid 669. Given that the two proteinases have completely different tertiary structures, it is perhaps not surprising that the binding sites are not identical. Furthermore, the respective binding sites may serve to dock the proteinase at a particular distance from the cleavage site. Because the cleavage sites lie seven amino acids apart, this may also apply constraints to the binding sites, which require them to be different. The binding domain on the HRV2 2Apro remains unclear despite the availability of its structure (50Petersen J.F. Cherney M.M. Liebig H.D. Skern T. Kuechler E. James M.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5463-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mutants of PV 2Apro have been described in the literature that impair or abrogate eIF4GI cleavage but which do not affect self-processing (15Bernstein H.D. Sonenberg N. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 11: 2913-2923Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 51Yu S.F. Lloyd R.E. Virology. 1991; 182: 615-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These mutants do not, however, cluster on any particular part of the 2Apro molecule, and it remains to be seen whether direct binding to eIF4GI is affected. The eIF4G isoforms act as protein adaptors during the initiation of protein synthesis (4Morley S.J. Curtis P.S. Pain V.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 1085-1104PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hentze M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 500-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Binding sites on eIF4G isoforms have been described for several proteins; these include other proteins of the eIF4 group (eIF4E, the cap-binding protein, and eIF4A, the RNA helicase), eIF3, the poly(A)-binding protein, and mitogen-activated protein kinase-interacting kinase-1 (MNK1) (2Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). In addition, a viral protein, the NSP3 protein of human rotavirus, has been shown to bind eIF4G at the same site as poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and to be able to displace PABP from its binding site (52Piron M. Vende P. Cohen J. Poncet D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5811-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, none of these proteins have been reported to bind to the region on eIF4GI (or to the equivalent region of eIF4GII, which is about 65% identical to this region of eIF4GI) identified here as being recognized by the picornaviral proteinases. Because viral proteins often evolve to use cellular binding sites, it seems feasible that a cellular protein may exist that can recognize this region. However, data base searches did not reveal any cellular proteins with a sequence related to the CTE of Lbpro (data not shown). The Lbpro of FMDV is among the smallest papain-like enzymes. Nevertheless, Lbpro has evolved a novel site away from the substrate binding pocket to accelerate cleavage of eIF4G isoforms. Once again, the pressure to compress viral genomes has resulted in the evolution of a versatile and multifunctional protein. We thank D. Blaas and J. Seipelt for critical reading and A. Gradi, R.

https://openalex.org/W2104062576,"844ins68 is a frequent polymorphism of the cystathionine beta-synthase gene (CBS) that consists of a 68-bp insertion duplicating the 3' splice site of intron 7 and the 5'-end of exon 8. The presence of two identical 3' splice sites spaced by 68 bp should lead to either a selection of the proximal site or to at least two alternatively spliced CBS mRNA variants. Instead, an accurate selection of the distal 3' splice site is observed in the 844ins68 carriers. The duplication has generated a gene re-arrangement at the 3' splice site where two GGGG runs have been brought close to each other. Using a minigene system, we have investigated the effect this peculiar configuration might have on the selection of the 3' splice site of intron 7 in the CBS gene. Minimal disruption of the G runs resulted in a dramatic shift toward the proximal 3' splice site selection with inclusion of the 68-bp insertion and a consequent change of the reading frame. The insertional event created this peculiar configuration of two G repeats close to each other that subsequently acquired the ability to strongly bind heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H1, a specific trans-acting factor. The interaction of hnRNP H1 with G runs within the 844ins68 context might interfere with the recruitment of splicing factors to the proximal 3' splice site thus favoring the selection of the distal 3' splice site. Our results therefore suggest the possibility that the insertion was an evolutionary event that allowed the rescue of the wild-type sequence, so preserving protein function."
https://openalex.org/W2058448641,"In a crystal structure of the amino-terminal laminin G-like domain of human sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), the biologically active estrogen metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2), binds in the same orientation as estradiol. The high affinity of SHBG for 2-MeOE2 relies primarily on hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl at C-3 of 2-MeOE2 and Asp65 and an interaction between the methoxy group at C-2 and the amido group of Asn82. Accommodation of the 2-MeOE2 methoxy group causes an outward displacement of residues Ser128–Pro130, which appears to disorder and displace the loop region (Leu131–His136) that covers the steroid-binding site. This could influence the binding kinetics of 2-MeOE2 and/or facilitate ligand-dependent interactions between SHBG and other proteins. Occupancy of a zinc-binding site reduces the affinity of SHBG for 2-MeOE2 and estradiol in the same way. The higher affinity of SHBG for estradiol derivatives with a halogen atom at C-2 is due to either enhanced hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl at C-3 and Asp65(2-fluoroestradiol) or accommodation of the functional group at C-2 (2-bromoestradiol), rather than an interaction with Asn82. By contrast, the low affinity of SHBG for 2-hydroxyestradiol can be attributed to intra-molecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyls in the aromatic steroid ring A, which generates a steric clash with the amido group of Asn82.

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) 1The abbreviations used are: SHBG, sex hormone-binding globulin; LG, laminin G-like; DHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone; 2-MeOE2, 2-methoxyestradiol. is the major plasma transport protein for biologically active sex steroids, and changes in its plasma concentrations influence the plasma half-lives of its steroid ligands and their access to target tissues (1Westphal U. Steroid-Protein Interactions II. Monographs on Endocrinology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 198-264Google Scholar, 2Hammond G.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1995; 6: 298-304Google Scholar). Human SHBG is a homodimeric glycoprotein, and each monomer contains a steroid-binding site within an amino-terminal laminin G-like (LG) domain (3Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Google Scholar, 4Avvakumov G.V. Grishkovskaya I. Muller Y.A. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34453-34457Google Scholar). Biologically active androgens and estradiol compete for occupancy of this binding site, but these two classes of sex steroids appear to enter the site quite differently and are bound in opposite orientations (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). Occupancy of the human SHBG steroid-binding site by estradiol is also accompanied by a specific positioning and/or conformation of amino acid residues on the surface of the protein that is not seen when the site is occupied by C19 steroids or the synthetic progestin, levonorgestrel (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). Such ligand-dependent alterations in the tertiary structure of SHBG are of interest in light of reports that it interacts with binding sites on the plasma membranes of different tissues in either a ligand-dependent (6Porto C.S. Gunsalus G.L. Bardin C.W. Phillips D.M. Musto N.A. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 436-445Google Scholar) or ligand-specific (7Avvakumov G.V. Zhuk N.I. Strelæhyonok O.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 881: 489-498Google Scholar) manner. The biological significance of these interactions remains poorly defined, but they may be implicated in rapid non-genomic actions of steroids (8Rosner W. Hryb D.J. Khan M.S. Nakhla A.M. Romas N.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 813-820Google Scholar). Human SHBG binds several androgen and estrogen metabolites (9Dunn J.F. Nisula B.C. Rodbard D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1981; 53: 58-68Google Scholar) and has a higher affinity for 2-methoxyestradiol (2-MeOE2) than for estradiol or testosterone (1Westphal U. Steroid-Protein Interactions II. Monographs on Endocrinology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 198-264Google Scholar). The presence of a halogen atom at C-2 of the estradiol molecule is also known to increase the affinity of ligand binding to SHBG (10Fernlund P. Gershagen S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 75-81Google Scholar), whereas a hydroxy group at the same position has the opposite effect (1Westphal U. Steroid-Protein Interactions II. Monographs on Endocrinology. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 198-264Google Scholar). The binding of 2-MeOE2 is of particular interest because this estrogen metabolite is biologically active, and appears to exert its effects via non-genomic mechanisms. For instance, 2-MeOE2 interacts with the colchicine-binding site of tubulin and inhibits its polymerization (11D'Amato R.J. Lin C.M. Flynn E. Folkman J. Hamel E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3964-3968Google Scholar). There is also increasing evidence that 2-MeOE2 acts on the vascular endothelium to inhibit blood vessel formation (12Pribluda V.S. Gubish Jr., E.R. LaVallee T.M. Treston A. Swartz G.M. Green S.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 173-179Google Scholar), and binding to plasma SHBG can therefore be expected to play a key role in regulating the amounts of biologically active 2-MeOE2 in the capillaries of tissues containing rapidly proliferating cells. It has also been reported that 2-MeOE2 binding to human SHBG in complex with its putative plasma membrane receptor fails to produce a signal transduction event similar to that observed when other steroids interact with plasma membrane-bound SHBG (8Rosner W. Hryb D.J. Khan M.S. Nakhla A.M. Romas N.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 813-820Google Scholar). The reason for this is obscure, but it may be related to specific ligand-dependent conformational changes in SHBG, as noted recently (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). We have now obtained a crystal structure of the amino-terminal LG domain of human SHBG in complex with 2-MeOE2, and we have combined this information with site-directed mutagenesis experiments to define the molecular basis of high affinity interactions between SHBG and estradiol derivatives with substitutions at C-2 of the steroid ring A. In view of our previous observations that occupancy of a zinc-binding site at the entrance of the human SHBG steroid-binding pocket specifically influences its ability to interact with estradiol (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar), we have also explored how this might affect the binding of 2-MeOE2. The amino-terminal LG domain of human SHBG was expressed, purified, and crystallized, as described previously (13Grishkovskaya I. Sklenar G. Avvakumov G.V. Dales D. Behlke J. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 2053-2055Google Scholar), with the exception that 2-MeOE2 was used instead of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to saturate the steroid-binding site during all steps. Crystallization was accomplished using the hanging drop method. In brief, 1 μl of protein solution (13 mg/ml protein, 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mmCaCl2) containing 10 μm 2-MeOE2 (Steraloids Inc.) was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (20% isopropyl alcohol, 10% polyethylene glycol 400, 100 mm CaCl2 in 100 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5). This crystallization mixture was equilibrated against 1 ml of reservoir solution at 20 °C, and crystals of SHBG in complex with 2-MeOE2 were obtained within 1 week. Before flash cooling, crystals were transferred into a soaking solution containing 30% isopropyl alcohol, 10% polyethylene glycol 400 in 100 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, for 5 min to prevent ice formation. A complete data set of SHBG bound to 2-MeOE2 was collected at 1.75-Å resolution at beam line BW7B of the EMBL outstation at the DESY synchrotron in Hamburg, Germany. Data were reduced with the program package DENZO/SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar), and the crystal structure was solved by difference Fourier techniques using the protein atomic coordinates for SHBG in complex with DHT from the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1D2S). To obtain target geometry parameters for the ligand (2-MeOE2) during crystallographic refinement, an idealized model was built by merging the crystal structure of 2,3-dimethoxyestradiol retrieved from the Cambridge structural data base (15Fletcher D.A. McMeeking R.F. Parkin D. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1996; 36: 746-749Google Scholar) with our previous estradiol model (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). From these coordinates, a topology and parameter file was generated using the Hic-up (x-ray.bmc.uu.se/hicup/) server (16Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Google Scholar). The structure of the complex was subjected to several rounds of refinement by molecular dynamics and energy minimization using the program CNS (17Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The free R-factor reflections were identical to those used previously to monitor the refinement of SHBG steroid complexes (3Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Google Scholar, 4Avvakumov G.V. Grishkovskaya I. Muller Y.A. Hammond G.L. J. Biol.

The final model and the experimental structure factor amplitudes have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank. Apart from the S128A SHBG variant, all the human SHBG variants used to assess the contribution of specific amino acids to the binding affinities for various steroid ligands were produced as described previously (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). The S128A SHBG variant was produced by site-directed mutagenesis (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar) by using the following oligonucleotide sequence with the altered bases within the codon for Ser128 underlined: 5′-GGTCAGGGGCCCAGCGACCTGTCTCAGG. The molecular sizes of the human SHBG variants produced in this way were similar to wild-type human SHBG when examined by Western blotting (19Bocchinfuso W.P. Warmels-Rodenhiser S. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1723-1729Google Scholar). A standard saturation analysis method employing dextran-coated charcoal as a separation agent, and [3H]DHT (42 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as the labeled ligand (20Hammond G.L. Lähteenmäki P.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Google Scholar), was used to determine the steroid-binding affinity and specificity of human SHBG purified from serum (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar) or recombinant wild-type human SHBG and human SHBG variants expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (19Bocchinfuso W.P. Warmels-Rodenhiser S. Hammond G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1723-1729Google Scholar). For competitive steroid-binding assays (20Hammond G.L. Lähteenmäki P.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1983; 132: 101-110Google Scholar), unlabeled steroids were obtained from the following sources: DHT and estradiol (Sigma); 2-MeOE2, 2-bromoestradiol, and 2-hydroxyestradiol (Steraloids); and 2-fluoroestradiol (kindly provided by Dr. J. van Lier, University of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada). The steroid-binding capacity assay was also modified to assess the influence of Zn2+ on SHBG-steroid interactions, as described previously (21Avvakumov G.V. Muller Y.A. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25920-25925Google Scholar). The structure of the amino-terminal LG domain of human SHBG in a complex with 2-MeOE2 has been solved at 1.75-Å resolution and refined to convergence to a crystallographic R-factor of 21.0% (RFree= 23.8%, see Table I). As in the corresponding estradiol-bound SHBG crystal structure (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar), 2-MeOE2 is oriented within the steroid-binding site so that its hydroxy group at C-3 is capable of interacting with Asp65, whereas the hydroxy group at C-17 can interact with Ser42 and the carbonyl oxygen of Val105 (Fig.1 A). Thus, this binding mode appears to be typical of C18 steroids and contrasts with that of C19 steroids and the synthetic progestin, levonorgestrel, which reside within the SHBG steroid-binding site in the opposite orientation (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar).Table ISummary of crystallographic data for human SHBG in complex with 2-MeOE2Data collectionResolution (Å)20–1.75 (1.79–1.75)Space groupR32Cell parameter a, c (Å)103.92, 84.46Number of reflections123,818Unique reflections17,701Completeness (%) (overall/outer shell)99.4/96.9Rsym (%) (overall/outer shell)3.1/28.6Refinement statisticsResolution (Å)20–1.75No. residues174No. water molecules97No. non-hydrogen atoms1501Average B-factor (Å2)38.5R value (%)21.0Rfree value (%)23.8Root mean square deviations (bond lengths in Å)0.010Root mean square deviations (bond angles in °)1.52 Open table in a new tab Although the main chain atoms of the 2-MeOE2-bound SHBG crystal structure can be superimposed on the crystal structures of SHBG in complex with estradiol or DHT with average root mean square deviations as low as 0.59 and 0.68 Å, respectively, the binding of 2-MeOE2 results in distinct conformational differences within the amino-terminal LG domain of SHBG. For instance, the methoxy group of 2-MeOE2 points into a hydrophobic pocket lined by residues Met107, Val112, Leu124, and Val127 (Fig. 1 A), and its accommodation within this pocket (Fig. 1 B) appears to affect conformation of the loop segment (Leu131–His136) that covers the SHBG steroid-binding site (22Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 621-626Google Scholar). Accordingly, the Cα atoms of residues that precede this loop segment (Ser128, Gly129, and Pro130) are in close proximity to the methoxy group and are pushed away from the binding site by 1.0, 1.8, and 4.8 Å, respectively, when compared with the SHBG-estradiol complex (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). Furthermore, residues Leu131–Ser133 are disordered in the SHBG complex with 2-MeOE2, and Lys134 and Arg135 are displaced when compared with the estradiol-bound SHBG complex (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar) by 2.1 and 3.4 Å, respectively (Fig. 1 B). In addition, the side chain of Trp84 is oriented toward the steroid in the SHBG complex with 2-MeOE2 (Fig. 1 A), which is similar to SHBG complexes with C19 steroids (3Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Google Scholar, 5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar) but quite different from that observed in the SHBG-estradiol complex (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). On the other hand, the region Trp170–Lys173 in the 2-MeOE2-bound SHBG structure closely follows the trace of the main chain of the estradiol-bound SHBG and diverges from the conformation observed in SHBG in complex with C19 steroids or levonorgestrel (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). This directly reflects the orientation of the steroid ligand in the binding site because it results from a van der Waals interaction between the C18 methyl group of estradiol or 2-MeOE2 with the side chain of Leu171, and this interaction does not exist in the complexes with C19 steroids. From this, we conclude that some structural alignments in the 2-MeOE2-bound SHBG are shared with other SHBG-steroid complexes; nevertheless, the binding of 2-MeOE2 results in several unique structural features within the amino-terminal LG domain of human SHBG. The residue Asp65 is a key player in the coordination of estradiol within the SHBG steroid-binding site (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar) and most likely participates in hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl at C-3 of 2-MeOE2 (Fig. 1 A). This is supported by the fact that the distance (2.48 Å) between this hydroxy group and the carboxylate group of Asp65 in the 2-MeOE2-bound SHBG structure is increased by only 0.1 Å, when compared with the SHBG-estradiol complex (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). Although Asn82 is within hydrogen bonding distance from the hydroxyl at C-3 of either estradiol or 2-MeOE2 in their respective SHBG complexes, we have shown previously (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis that its contribution to the binding affinity of SHBG for estradiol is negligible. This is probably also the case for the SHBG complex with 2-MeOE2 because the distance between Asn82 and the hydroxyl at C-3 of the steroid is increased by 0.2 Å, as compared with the estradiol-bound SHBG structure (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). On the other hand, the oxygen atom of the 2-MeOE2 methoxy group is only 3.0 Å from the Asn82amido group (Fig. 1 A), and the possibility of an interaction between these two functional groups exists. Previous studies (3Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Google Scholar, 5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar) have shown that functional groups at positions C-3 and C-17 of steroid ligands interact with Ser42 and Asp65 depending on their orientation within the SHBG steroid-binding site. The contribution of these residues to the high affinity binding of 2-MeOE2 was evaluated by comparing its ability to bind S42A and D65A SHBG variants with those of estradiol and DHT (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). As shown in TableII, the binding of 2-MeOE2 to S42A is less affected when compared with estradiol. In this context, it is important to appreciate that although estradiol and 2-MeOE2 compete more effectively with DHT for binding to the S42A SHBG variant, its affinity for DHT is greatly reduced (Table II). Thus, the net result of this amino acid substitution on estradiol and 2-MeOE2 binding to SHBG is also negative. By contrast, substitution of Asp65 with alanine has no effect on DHT-binding affinity but causes a substantial decrease in the binding affinity of both estradiol and 2-MeOE2 (TableII). This is in line with our previous conclusion that this residue plays a much more important role in the binding of C18 steroids than C19 steroids (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). Crystal structures of human SHBG in complex with other steroid ligands have indicated that Asn82 might also contribute to their coordination within the steroid-binding site, but substitution of this residue does not influence the binding of C19 steroids, levonorgestrel or estradiol (3Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Google Scholar, 5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). This is shown again in Table II. However, the binding affinity of 2-MeOE2 to the N82A SHBG variant is significantly reduced. This is in accordance with the crystal structure data indicating that the methoxy group of 2-MeOE2 can interact with the amido group of Asn82 and thereby contributes to the high affinity of human SHBG for 2-MeOE2.Table IIComparison of the dissociation constants (Kd) for DHT and the relative binding affinities (RBA) for estradiol and 2-MeOE2 of wild-type human SHBG and human SHBG variants produced by site-directed mutagenesis showing the fold increases (↑) or decreases (↓) when compared with wild-type SHBG valuesSHBGKd for DHT at 4 °CRBAaDetermined as a ratio of the concentration of steroid competitor resulting in a 50% reduction in specific binding of [3H]DHT to the concentration of DHT required to produce the same effect.

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of 2-MeOE2-bound SHBG indicates that the methoxy group protrudes into a pocket that includes Met107 (Fig.1 A), and when this residue was substituted with alanine the resulting SHBG variant displayed a specific increase in affinity for 2-MeOE2 (Table II). In view of the displacement of residues from the loop segment Leu131 to His136 (see above), these data imply that the accommodation of the methoxy group generates steric clashes in this region of SHBG, which are attenuated by the replacement of Met107 with a smaller amino acid, such as alanine. Deeper within the SHBG steroid-binding site, Gly58is located in such close proximity to steroid ligands that any substitution at this position will likely cause a steric clash and a marked reduction in steroid binding (3Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Sklenar G. Dales D. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 504-512Google Scholar). As in the case of estradiol (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar), the binding of 2-MeOE2 to the G58A SHBG variant is affected to a lesser extent than that of DHT (Table II), but overall this amino acid substitution still results in an ∼15-fold reduction in binding affinity for these C18 steroids. The difference in the reduction of the relative affinities of the G58A SHBG variant for C18 and C19 steroids, as compared with wild-type SHBG, probably reflects the difference in their orientation within the SHBG steroid-binding site. In the SHBG complex with 2-MeOE2, the loop segment (Leu131–His136) that covers the steroid-binding site appears to be displaced when compared with the estradiol-bound SHBG structure reported previously (Fig.1 B). This loop segment is flanked by prolines at positions 130 and 137 that appear to control its flexibility (22Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 621-626Google Scholar). When these proline residues are substituted with glycine to augment the flexibility of this loop segment, this increases the affinity for 2-MeOE2 (Table II), as shown previously for estradiol (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). This confirms that the flexibility of the loop segment influences the binding of C18 steroids, and supports the hypothesis that this region of the polypeptide chain influences the ability of different classes of steroids to either enter or exit the binding site. Although the methoxy group of 2-MeOE2 appears to push away residues adjacent to the loop segment that covers the steroid-binding site, such as Ser128, substitution of this residue with alanine has no effect on the affinity of SHBG for 2-MeOE2 or other steroids (TableII). Within the loop region itself, Leu131 influences the binding of C19 steroids and estradiol (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). However, our present data indicate that Leu131 has little impact on the binding of 2-MeOE2 (Table II), and this is in agreement with the observation that Leu131, Thr132, and Ser133 are disordered in the crystal structure (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, substitution of other residues within the loop region (e.g.Lys134 or His136) had little or no effect on the binding of 2-MeOE2 (Table II). This was expected because in the 2-MeOE2-bound SHBG crystal structure the chain segment Lys134–His136 is associated with high thermal displacement factors, which indicates that this region packs only loosely against the steroid-binding site. The steroid ligand-specific rearrangement of this loop segment may, however, have implications with respect to possible interactions between SHBG and other proteins, such as a specific receptor that has been reported to reside within the plasma membranes of some tissues (6Porto C.S. Gunsalus G.L. Bardin C.W. Phillips D.M. Musto N.A. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 436-445Google Scholar, 7Avvakumov G.V. Zhuk N.I. Strelæhyonok O.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 881: 489-498Google Scholar). If so, this would be in line with the concept that this region of the molecule represents a conserved interaction surface within a family of functionally highly diverse proteins that share the LG domain fold (23Rudenko G. Hohenester E. Muller Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 363-368Google Scholar). The orientation of the Trp84 side chain in the 2-MeOE2-bound SHBG structure (Fig. 1 A) also differs from its outward orientation in estradiol-bound SHBG (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). The affinity of the W84A SHBG variant for 2-MeOE2 is essentially unchanged in relation to DHT, whereas its net affinity for estradiol increases 2-fold (TableII). This reflects the fact that the orientation of the side chain of Trp84 in the DHT and 2-MeOE2 complexes differs from that in the estradiol complex. The higher affinity of the W84A SHBG variant for estradiol can be attributed to an energetically disfavored orientation of Trp84 in wild-type SHBG caused by the inward movement of the residues (Ser128, Gly129, and Pro130) preceding the loop segment Leu131–His136 (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). In contrast, the methoxy group of 2-MeOE2 pushes these residues (Ser128–Pro130) outward upon occupancy of the SHBG steroid-binding site, and this circumvents the need for a reorientation of Trp84 (Fig. 1 A). These observations further support the concept that the outward position of Trp84 represents a unique feature of the surface topology of estradiol-bound SHBG that could provide the basis for its recognition by other macromolecules (5Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Catalano M.G. Muller Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32086-32093Google Scholar). Both Asp65 and His136 play key roles in coordinating a zinc ion at the entrance of the steroid-binding site, and occupancy of this zinc-binding site causes a marked reorientation of the side chains of these residues (21Avvakumov G.V. Muller Y.A. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25920-25925Google Scholar). This in turn appears to alter the conformation of the loop segment that covers the steroid-binding site (22Grishkovskaya I. Avvakumov G.V. Hammond G.L. Muller Y.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 621-626Google Scholar), and the combined effects cause a reduction in the binding affinity of human SHBG for estradiol, as compared with DHT or other C19 steroids (21Avvakumov G.V. Muller Y.A. Hammond G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25920-25925Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest that the affinity of wild-type human SHBG for 2-MeOE2 is reduced in the presence of zinc chloride to approximately the same extent as that of estradiol (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, the negative effect of zinc binding on both of these C18 steroids was eliminated by substitution of His136 (Fig. 2 B) and Asp65 (Fig. 2 C) with glutamine and alanine, respectively, in order to prevent the coordination of a zinc ion at this site. Thus, the mechanism by which zinc reduces the binding affinity of estradiol is also operative for 2-MeOE2 and may have some interesting implications with respect to the possible use of zinc to enhance the pharmacological properties of 2-MeOE2 (12Pribluda V.S. Gubish Jr., E.R. LaVallee T.M. Treston A. Swartz G.M. Green S.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 173-179Google Scholar) by reducing its binding to SHBG. It has been noted previously (10Fernlund P. Gershagen S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 75-81Google Scholar) that human SHBG has an exceptionally high affinity for 2-iodoestradiol exceeding that of DHT. When compared with 2-MeOE2, it is apparent that other derivatives of estradiol with halogen atoms (namely, fluorine or bromine) at the C-2 position exhibit higher affinities for human SHBG (Fig.3). There may be several explanations for this. The functional group at C-2 of estradiol can be involved in direct hydrophilic interactions with SHBG, and the oxygen atom of the methoxy group of 2-MeOE2 appears to hydrogen-bond with the amido group of Asn82 in the SHBG crystal structure, as discussed above. With respect to the different C-2 derivatives of estradiol, the strength of this interaction should depend on the electronegativity of the hydrogen-bond acceptor at C-2. However, removal of the hydrogen bond donor (amido group of Asn82) by site-directed mutagenesis (N82A SHBG variant, Tables II andIII) results in only moderate reductions in binding affinity for C-2 derivatives of estradiol. Furthermore, the reduction in affinity for 2-methoxyestradiol (4-fold) was greater than for the C-2 estradiol derivative (i.e. 2-fluoroestradiol) that contains the most electronegative atom (Tables II and III). Thus, hydrogen bonding between functional groups at C-2 of the steroid and Asn82 is unlikely to be a major determinant of their high affinity binding to SHBG.Table IIIRelative binding affinity (RBA) of wild-type SHBG and D65A and N82A SHBG variants for 2-fluoroestradiol and 2-bromoestradiol showing the fold decreases (↓) as compared with wild-type SHBG valuesSHBGRBAaDetermined as a ratio of the concentration of steroid competitor resulting in a 50% reduction in specific binding of [3H]DHT to the concentration of DHT required to produce the same effect.2-Fluoroestradiol2-BromoestradiolWild type1.8 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.1D65A57.8 ± 6.8bSignificantly different (p < 0.05) from the corresponding parameter of wild-type SHBG.

Open table in a new tab It is also possible that the functional group at C-2 of the steroid modulates the strength of the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl at C-3 and Asp65 of SHBG via electronic effects on the aromatic ring A. This is corroborated by the fact that the affinity of 2-fluoroestradiol for the D65A SHBG variant is reduced by 39-fold when compared with wild-type SHBG, whereas much smaller reductions in affinity were observed for estradiol, 2-MeOE2, and 2-bromoestradiol (Tables II and III). However, the size of the functional group at C-2 of the steroid may also determine how well it is accommodated within the hydrophobic pocket lined by Met107, Val112, Leu124, and Val127 (Fig. 1 A). This may explain the very high affinity of SHBG for 2-iodoestradiol (10Fernlund P. Gershagen S. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 75-81Google Scholar) and 2-bromoestradiol (Table III). In contrast to other C-2 derivatives of estradiol, 2-hydroxyestradiol binds only poorly to SHBG (Fig. 3). This is somewhat surprising because a hydroxyl at C-2 should require less space than the methoxy group of 2-MeOE2, and should hydrogen-bond with the side chain of Asn82 and exert a similar effect on the adjacent hydroxyl at C-3. As observed for 2-MeOE2 (Table II and Fig.4 A) and C-2 halogen derivatives of estradiol (Table III), the affinity of the D65A SHBG variant for 2-hydroxyestradiol was reduced (Fig. 4 A). This implies that an interaction between Asp65 and the hydroxyl at C-3 of all C18 steroids is a key element in their binding to human SHBG. However, unlike other functional groups, the hydroxyl at C-2 of 2-hydroxyestradiol can act both as a hydrogen bond acceptor and donor. In this context, the crystal structure of catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene), which mimics this portion of 2-hydroxyestradiol, might explain the poor affinity of SHBG for this estradiol metabolite. In catechol, an intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed between the two hydroxy groups (24Wunderlich V.H. Mootz D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1971; 27: 1684-1686Google Scholar) as originally predicted based on the physical properties of different dihydroxybenzene isomers (25Pauling L.C. The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals: An Introduction to Modern Structural Chemistry. 3rd Ed. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY1960: 494Google Scholar). This intramolecular hydrogen bond most likely also exists in 2-hydroxyestradiol and produces a steric clash with the amido group of Asn82 when modeled within the structure of the SHBG steroid-binding site (Fig. 5). To test this model, we examined the affinity of the N82A SHBG variant for various C-2 derivatives of estradiol. As expected, its affinity for 2-hydroxyestradiol was increased, as compared with wild-type SHBG (Fig.4 B), whereas its affinities for other C-2 derivatives of estradiol were decreased (Tables II and III).Figure 5Model to explain how intramolecular hydrogen bonding in 2-hydroxyestradiol impacts negatively on its interaction with Asn82 within the human SHBG steroid-binding site.Ring A of 2-hydroxyestradiol and the carbamide group of Asn82, with attached hydrogen atoms (black dots), are modeled using the coordinates of the crystal structures of catechol (24Wunderlich V.H. Mootz D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1971; 27: 1684-1686Google Scholar) and asparagine monohydrate (32Verbist J.J. Lehmann M.S. Koetzle T.F. Hamilton W.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Sci. 1972; 28: 3006-3013Google Scholar), respectively. When assuming that the hydroxyl at C-3 of 2-hydroxyestradiol forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of Asp65, a steric clash will occur between the hydroxyl at C-2 of the steroid ring A and the amido group of Asn82.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The remarkable difference in the affinity of human SHBG for 2-hydroxyestradiol and its major metabolite, 2-MeOE2, is intriguing and could be physiologically important, particularly in terms of cancer cell biology. Within estrogen target cells, 2-hydroxyestradiol has a propensity for direct DNA adduct formation and is a particularly reactive metabolite that is capable of releasing superoxide and hydroxyl radicals during catechol estrogen quinone-semiquinone redox cycling (26Cavalieri E.L. Stack D.E. Devanesan P.D. Todorovic R. Dwivedy I. Higginbotham S. Johansson S.L. Patil K.D. Gross M.L. Gooden J.K. Ramanathan R. Cerny R.L. Rogan E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10937-10942Google Scholar). Methylation of 2-hydroxyestradiol via the action of catechol-methyltransferase therefore represents an important step in the removal of this potentially damaging catechol estrogen, especially in the context of rapidly proliferating cells (27Dawling S. Roodi N. Mernaugh R.L. Wang X. Parl F.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6716-6722Google Scholar). Once the resulting 2-MeOE2 leaves the cell, it may act as an anti-angiogenic agent in blood capillaries (12Pribluda V.S. Gubish Jr., E.R. LaVallee T.M. Treston A. Swartz G.M. Green S.J. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 173-179Google Scholar), and in this location the relative levels of SHBG are likely to play a key role in regulating its local activities and/or the rate of its removal from tissues. Thus, the information derived from the present studies may provide a basis for designing 2-methoxy estrogen analogues with improved anti-angiogenic and/or anti-proliferative activities (28Brueggemeier R.W.

https://openalex.org/W2055240281,"When sphingomyelin is digested by sphingomyelinase in the plasma membrane of rat astrocytes, productions of sphingomyelin, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylcholine are stimulated. D609, an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, suppressed these effects. Similarly, when apolipoprotein A-I removed cellular cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin to generate high density lipoprotein, cholesterol synthesis from acetate subsequently increased, and sphingomyelin synthesis from acetate and serine also increased. D609 inhibited these effects again. D609 also inhibited the cholesterol removal by apoA-I not only from the astrocytes but also from BALB/3T3 and RAW264 cells. D609 decreased cholesterol synthesis, although D609 did not directly inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. ApoA-I-stimulated translocation of newly synthesized cholesterol to cytosol was also decreased by D609. A diacylglycerol analog increased the apoA-I-mediated cholesterol release, whereas ceramide did not influence it. We concluded that removal of cellular sphingomyelin by apolipoproteins is replenished by transfer of phosphorylcholine from phosphatidylcholine to ceramide, and this reaction may limit the removal of cholesterol by apoA-I. This reaction also produces diacylglycerol that potentially triggers subsequent cellular signal cascades and regulates intracellular cholesterol trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2073554351,"Mitochondrial AAA metalloproteases play a fundamental role in mitochondrial biogenesis and function. They have been identified in yeast and animals but not yet in plants. This work describes the isolation and sequence analysis of the full-length cDNA from the pea (Pisum sativum) with significant homology to the yeast matrix AAA (m-AAA) protease. The product of this clone was imported into isolated pea mitochondria where it was processed to its mature form (PsFtsH). We have shown that the central region of PsFtsH containing the chaperone domain is exposed to the matrix space. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the pea protease can complement respiration deficiency in the yta10 and/oryta12 null yeast mutants, indicating that the plant protein can compensate for the loss of at least some of the important m-AAA functions in yeast. Based on biochemical experiments using isolated pea mitochondria, we propose that PsFtsH-like m-AAA is involved in the accumulation of the subunit 9 of the ATP synthase in the mitochondrial membrane."

The catalytic competence of the Asp641 residue of the catalytic triad (Ser554, Asp641, His680) was studied using the D641N and D641A variants of the enzyme. Both variants displayed 3 orders of magnitude reduction ink cat/K m for benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-2-naphthylamide. Using an octapeptide substrate, the decrease was 6 orders of magnitude, whereas with Z-Gly-Pro-4-nitrophenyl ester there was virtually no change ink cat/K m. This indicates that the contribution of Asp641 is very much dependent on the substrate-leaving group, which was not the case for the classic serine peptidase, trypsin. The rate constant for benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-thiobenzylester conformed to this series as demonstrated by a method designed for monitoring the hydrolysis of thiolesters in the presence of thiol groups. Alkylation of His680 with Z-Gly-Pro-CH2Cl was concluded with similar rate constants for wild-type and D641A variant. However, kinetic measurements with Z-Gly-Pro-OH, a product-like inhibitor, indicated that the His680 is not accessible in the enzyme variants.

Crystal structure determination of these mutants revealed subtle perturbations related to the catalytic activity. Many of these observations show differences in the catalysis between trypsin and prolyl oligopeptidase. The catalytic triad, which consists of serine, histidine, and aspartate residues, is an essential part of the catalytic machinery of serine peptidases. The role of Ser195 and His57in chymotrypsin catalysis is firmly established, but the contribution of Asp102 to the catalysis has been the subject of a long discussion, following the discovery of a hydrogen bond between the catalytic His57 and Asp102. It was postulated that the three residues form a charge-relay system, in which the proton of the Ser195 OH group was mediated by the His57 imidazole to the Asp102 carboxylate ion (1Blow D.M. Birktoft J.J. Hartley B.S. Nature. 1969; 221: 337-340Google Scholar). This assumption was questioned on the basis of the chemical properties of the interacting groups, which render the proton transfer from the basic serine OH group to an acidic carboxyl group highly unlikely (2Polgár L. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 1335-1342Google Scholar). The lack of proton transfer to the aspartate residue was confirmed by NMR (3Bachovchin W.W. Roberts J.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 8041-8047Google Scholar, 4Bachovchin W.W. Kaiser R. Richards J.A. Roberts J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7323-7326Google Scholar, 5Jordan F. Polgár L. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6366-6370Google Scholar) and neutron diffraction experiments (6Kossiakoff A.A. Spencer S.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6462-6474Google Scholar). Further proposals have suggested that the catalytic triad serves as a charge stabilizing system, in which the aspartate ion stabilizes the protonated histidine. This species interacts with the negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate. It was also suggested that Asp102 may participate in the correct orientation of the tautomer of His57, which is essential for accepting the proton from the Ser195 (2Polgár L. Bender M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 1335-1342Google Scholar, 7Polgár L. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Acad. Sci. Hung. 1972; 7: 29-34Google Scholar, 8Fersht A.R. Sperling J. J. Mol.

CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 87-122Google Scholar). The catalytic histidine (His57) of the trypsin-type enzymes functions as a general base catalyst that assists the proton transfer from the serine OH to the leaving group of the substrate through the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate on the reaction path. This process generates an acyl enzyme, which is subsequently hydrolyzed by the reverse mechanism of acylation (10Polgár L. Mechanisms of Protease Action. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 87-122Google Scholar, 11Polgár L. New Compr. Biochem. 1987; 16: 159-200Google Scholar). In the native trypsin, Nε2 of the catalytic histidine is the basic nitrogen atom that accepts the proton from the serine OH, whereas the protonated Nδ1 forms a hydrogen bond with the Asp102. The catalytic triad of trypsin was investigated by substituting the neutral Asn for Asp102 (12Sprang S. Standing T. Fletterick R.J. Stroud R.M. Finer-Moore J. Xuong N.-H. Hamlin R. Rutter W.J. Craik C.C. Science. 1987; 237: 905-909Google Scholar, 13Craik C.S. Roczniak S. Largman C. Rutter W.J. Science. 1987; 237: 909-913Google Scholar). It was concluded from the observed 4-orders of magnitude decrease in rate, as well as from x-ray crystallographic studies, that the modified enzyme held the unfavorable tautomer form of His57 that was unable to accept the proton from the serine OH group. Specifically, the Nε2 of His57was protonated, and the basic Nδ1 formed a hydrogen bond with the NH2 group of Asn102 (12Sprang S. Standing T. Fletterick R.J. Stroud R.M. Finer-Moore J. Xuong N.-H. Hamlin R. Rutter W.J. Craik C.C. Science. 1987; 237: 905-909Google Scholar). When both the Nδ1 and Nε2 atoms were protonated, His57 adopted an alternative conformation and interacted with a solvent water molecule rather than with the Asn102 residue. Here we have examined the catalytic triad of prolyl oligopeptidase, which is a member of a relatively new group of serine peptidases, unrelated to the well known trypsin and subtilisin families. The new family includes enzymes of different specificities, like the prolyl oligopeptidase itself, dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, acylaminoacyl-peptidase, and oligopeptidase B (14Rennex D. Hemmings B.A. Hofsteenge J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2195-2203Google Scholar, 15Rawlings N.D. Polgár L. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 907-911Google Scholar, 16Polgár L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 188-200Google Scholar, 17Polgár L. Cell..Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 349-362Google Scholar). They share the way of selecting and cleaving substrates of no longer than about 30 amino acid residues in total. Prolyl oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26) is implicated in the metabolism of peptide hormones and neuropeptides (18Wilk S. Life Sci. 1983; 33: 2149-2157Google Scholar, 19Mentlein R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 251-2566Google Scholar, 20Cunningham D.F. O'Connor B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 160-186Google Scholar). Because specific inhibitors relieve scopolamine-induced amnesia (21Yoshimoto T. Orlowski C.R. Walter R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 660-665Google Scholar, 22Atack J.R. Suman-Chauhan N. Dawson G.

The activity of prolyl oligopeptidase has also been associated with depression (25Maes M. Goossens F. Scharpé S. Meltzer H.Y. D'Hondt P. Cosyns P. Biol. Psychiatry. 1994; 35: 545-552Google Scholar, 26Williams R.S.B. Eames M. Ryves W.J. Viggars J. Harwood A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2734-2745Google Scholar) and blood pressure regulation (27Welches W.R. Brosnihan K.B. Ferrario C.M. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 1461-1480Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure determination of prolyl oligopeptidase has revealed that the carboxyl-terminal peptidase domain of the enzyme displays an α/β hydrolase fold and that its catalytic triad (Ser554, His680, Asp641) is covered by the central tunnel of an unusual β-propeller (28Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Google Scholar). Recent engineering of the enzyme provided evidence for a novel strategy of regulation, in which oscillating propeller blades act as a gating filter during catalysis, letting small peptide substrates into the active site while excluding large proteins to prevent accidental proteolysis in the cytosol (29Fülöp V. Szeltner Z. Polgár L. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 277-281Google Scholar). This work concentrates on two variants of prolyl oligopeptidase (D641N and D641A), which were prepared for studying the catalytic competence of Asp641. It is anticipated that the alanine residue is not able to stabilize the catalytic histidine in the unfavorable tautomer form, as found with D102N trypsin. Hence, the study of the two variants may permit discrimination between the charge and the hydrogen-bonding effects of the Asp641 on the imidazole ring. Prolyl oligopeptidase from porcine brain and its variants were expressed in Escherichia coli JM105 cells and purified as described previously (30Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 353-360Google Scholar). The enzyme concentrations were determined at 280 nm (16Polgár L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 188-200Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced with the two-step polymerase chain reaction as described for the Y473F mutant (30Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 353-360Google Scholar). The following primers were used to produce the D641N mutant: 5′-CTCACaGCtGACCACaAcGACCGA-3′ and 3′-GAGTGtCGaCTGGTGtTgCTGGCT-5′. An extra recognition site for PvuII restriction enzyme (underlined) was also created with silent mutations. The primers for the D641A mutation were as follows: 5′-GCCGACCACGcgGACCGAGTGGTCC-3′ and 3′-CGGCTGGTGCgcCTGGCTCACCAGG-5′. An RsrII restriction site (underlined) was also introduced with the alanine codon (GCG), which was used to verify the incorporation of the mutant oligonucleotides into the PCR product. The reaction of prolyl oligopeptidase with Z-Gly-Pro-Nap (Bachem Ltd., Bubendorf, Switzerland) was measured fluorometrically, using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier four-position multicell holder accessory and a temperature controller. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 and 410 nm, respectively. Cells with excitation and emission path-lengths of 1.0 and 0.4 cm, respectively, were used. The substrate with internally quenched fluorescence, Abz-Gly-Phe-Gly-Pro-Phe-Gly-Phe(NO2)-Ala-NH2, was prepared with solid phase synthesis, and its hydrolysis was followed as in the case of Z-Gly-Pro-Nap, except that the excitation and emission wavelengths were 337 and 420 nm, respectively. The liberation of 4-nitrophenol from Z-Gly-Pro-ONp was monitored spectrophotometrically at 400 nm. The hydrolysis of Z-Gly-Pro-SBzl was measured at 240 nm, which indicated the decrease in the absorbance of the thiolester. The pseudo-first order rate constants were measured at substrate concentrations lower than 0.1 K m and were calculated by nonlinear regression data analysis, using the GraFit software (31Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 5. Erythacus Software Ltd., Staines, Middlesex, United Kingdom2001Google Scholar). The specificity rate constants (k cat/K m) were obtained by dividing the first order rate constant by the total enzyme concentration in the reaction mixture. The Michaelis-Menten parameters (k cat andK m) were determined with initial rate measurements, using substrate concentrations in the range of 0.2 to 5K m value. Because of the poor solubility of Z-Gly-Pro-Nap, in particular in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl, the reactions were carried out in the presence of 0.25% acetonitrile, which caused about 20% inhibition of prolyl oligopeptidase. The kinetic parameters were calculated with nonlinear regression analysis. At very low K m the parameters were calculated from progress curves using the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation (32Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press Ltd., London, United Kingdom1995: 44-47Google Scholar,33Polgár L. Proteolytic Enzymes. Tools and Targets. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 148-166Google Scholar). Theoretical curves for the bell-shaped pH-rate profiles were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis, using Equation 1 (below) and the GraFit software (31Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 5. Erythacus Software Ltd., Staines, Middlesex, United Kingdom2001Google Scholar). In Equation 1,k cat/K m(limit) stands for the pH-independent maximum rate constant, and K 1 andK 2 are the dissociation constants of catalytically competent base and acid, respectively. When an additional ionizing group modifies the bell-shaped character of the pH dependence curve, the data were fitted to Equation 2 (doubly bell-shaped) or Equation 3 (doubly bell-shaped curve with double ionization at the basic limb) (below). The limiting values in the equations stand for the pH-independent maximum rate constants for the two active forms of the enzyme, and K 1, K 2,K 3, and K x are the apparent dissociation constants of the enzymatic groups, whose state of ionization controls the rate constants.kcat/Km=kcat/Km(limit)[1/(1+10pK1−pH+10pH−pK2)](Eq. 1) kcat/Km=kcat/Km(limit)1[1/(1+10pK1−pH+10pH−pK2)]+kcat/Km(limit)2[1/(1+10pK2−pH+10pH−pK3)](Eq. 2) kcat/Km=kcat/Km(limit)1[1/(1+10pK1−pH+10pH−pK2)]+kcat/Km(limit)2[1/(1+10pK2−pH+10pH−pK3+102pH−pK3−pKx)](Eq. 3) TheK i values, the dissociation constants of the enzyme·inhibitor complex, were calculated from Equation 4, below, where k i and k 0 are pseudo-first order rate constants determined at substrate concentrations < 0.1 K m in the presence and absence of inhibitor (I), respectively. In the case of slow reactions initial rates were measured instead of the first order rate constants. ki/k0=1/(1+I/Ki)(Eq. 4) The dissociation constant for an internally quenched substrate was determined by measuring the fluorescence change upon binding of the substrate to the inactive S554A variant of prolyl oligopeptidase. The formation of enzyme·substrate complex at similar concentrations of the enzyme and substrate is described by Equation 5, shown below, when the conditions for the Michaelis-Menten equation do not meet (34Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 72-74Google Scholar), and by Equation 6, where ES and K s are the enzyme-substrate complex and its dissociation constant, respectively.ES=((S0+E+Ks)−sqrt(sqr(S0+E+Ks)−4E*S0))/2(Eq. 5) ΔF=ΔFmax*((S0+E+Ks)−sqrt(sqr(S0+E+Ks)−4E*S0))/2*S0(Eq. 6) The substrate (S0) was saturated with increasing amounts of enzyme (E). Although ES is not known, its concentration is proportional to the change in the fluorescence signal, measured at 328- and 420-nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. Hence, Equation 5 can be transformed into Equation 6, where ΔF corresponds to ES, and ΔF max gives the change in signal when the substrate is completely converted into the enzyme·substrate complex. A plot of ΔF against E givesK s and ΔF max using nonlinear regression. The Z-Gly-Pro-CH2Cl was prepared from Z-Gly-Pro-OH (Bachem Ltd.) by preparing the diazomethyl intermediate (21Yoshimoto T. Orlowski C.R. Walter R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 660-665Google Scholar, 35Shaw E. Green D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 820-826Google Scholar), which was then transformed into the product as described previously (36Kettner C. Shaw E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 827-843Google Scholar). The oily compound was purified by chromatography. The inactivation of prolyl oligopeptidase by the irreversible inhibitor, Z-Gly-Pro-CH2Cl, was followed in the presence of substrate (37Tian W.-X. Tsou C.-L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1028-1032Google Scholar, 38Tsou C.-L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 381-436Google Scholar) under pseudo-first order conditions (I 0≫ E 0). Z-Gly-Pro-Nap or suc-Gly-Pro-Nan was used as substrates at high enough concentrations so that less than 10% of substrate was consumed during the complete inactivation of the enzyme. The first order apparent rate constant of inactivation,k app, was calculated from Equation 7, shown below, where P and Pinf are the concentrations of the product at times t and t infinite (when the enzyme is completely inactivated), respectively. Ifk app, which is dependent on the inhibitor concentration, is plotted against I,k inact and K i(app) can be obtained from Equation 8, shown below, using nonlinear regression analysis. Under the conditions employed S0 ≪K m, therefore K i(app) =K i.

X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on an ADSC Q4 CCD detector. Data were processed using the HKL suite of programs (39Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). Refinements of the structures were carried out by alternate cycles of X-PLOR (40Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2195-2203Google Scholar) (PDB code 1qfm). A bulk solvent correction allowed all measured data to be used. Water molecules were added to the atomic model at the positions of large positive peaks (>3.0 ς) in the difference electron density, only at places when the resulting water molecule fell into an appropriate hydrogen-bonding environment. Restrained isotropic temperature factor refinements were carried out for each individual atom. The final model contains all the 710 amino acid residues in both complexes, the bound peptides, and a large number of solvent (glycerol and water) molecules.

Open table in a new tab The reaction of wild-type prolyl oligopeptidase with the Z-Gly-Pro-Nap substrate has revealed two pH-dependent enzyme forms, arising from the change in the ionization state of some enzymatic group (30Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 353-360Google Scholar). The two forms prevail in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl, but the high salt concentration increases k cat/K m by a factor of about 2.5 (Table II). The pH rate profile of the D641N variant also displays doubly bell character both in the presence and the absence of 0.5 m salt (Fig.1 A). However, the points do not properly fit to the theoretical doubly bell curve (see Equation 2and Fig. 1 A, thin line), indicating that additional ionizing groups affect the reaction. Clearly, the sharper slopes, which involve the participation of two acidic groups in the alkaline pH range, better follow the experimental points (see Fig.1 A, thick lines and Equation 3). This decline in activity may be caused by reversible unfolding of the protein (42Polgár L. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 267-271Google Scholar). Importantly, the rate constants are lower by 3 orders of magnitude than those obtained with the wild-type enzyme (Table II), and this underlines the essential role of the aspartate ion in the catalysis.Table IIKinetic parameters for the reactions of prolyl oligopeptidase variants with Z-Gly-Pro-Napk(limit)1k(limit)2pK 1pK 2pK 3pK xmm−1 s−1Wild-typeaFrom Ref. 48.1750 ± 2005070 ± 2204.88 ± 0.317.47 ± 0.139.16 ± 0.06+0.5 mNaClaFrom Ref. 48.5090 ± 24012,820 ± 6905.20 ± 0.107.74 ± 0.118.73 ± 0.06D641 N1.51 ± 0.083.83 ± 0.775.96 ± 0.099.02 ± 0.2710.16 ± 0.328.02 ± 0.34+0.5 mNaCl1.66 ± 0.235.44 ± 1.056.29 ± 0.198.63 ± 0.2710.23 ± 0.357.59 ± 0.35D641A4.02 ± 0.5613.09 ± 0.965.84 ± 0.157.80 ± 0.158.88 ± 0.07+0.5 m NaCl10.65 ± 0.29bk(limit) of Equation 1rather than k(limit)2.6.59 ± 0.048.74 ± 0.05a From Ref. 48Szeltner Z.

Open table in a new tab The activity of the D641A enzyme variant is also reduced by 3 orders of magnitude, although the rate constant is slightly higher than that for the D641N variant (Table II). In the absence of 0.5 m NaCl, the reaction of the D641A variant exhibits a virtually proper doubly bell-shaped pH-rate profile (Equation 2); namely, the additional acidic group observed with the D641N enzyme is not noticeable with the D641A variant (see Table II and Fig. 1 B). In contrast to the D641N enzyme, the D641A variant gives a simple bell-shaped curve in the presence of salt. For the D641A variant, particularly at high salt concentration, the pH optimum is shifted toward the lower pH, so the activity of the low-pH form of the enzyme becomes predominant relative to the high-pH form. The enhancement of rate with the increase in ionic strength is another difference between the wild-type enzyme and its variants. Compared with the wild-type enzyme, the rate increase is significantly less with the high-pH form of the D641N variant and practically does not change with the low pH form. In the case of the D641A variant, the effect of salt leads to an alteration in the pH-rate profile by eliminating the doubly bell character of the curve. The pH dependences of the prolyl oligopeptidase variants are substantially different from that observed with the D102N trypsin. At neutral pH, the mutant trypsin was ∼104 times less active than the unmodified enzyme. With the increase in pH, the activity increased considerably and approached that of the native enzyme. For these effects, a conclusive explanation could not be offered. The enhanced activity was assigned to the participation of either a titratable base or of a hydroxide ion (13Craik C.S. Roczniak S. Largman C. Rutter W.J. Science. 1987; 237: 909-913Google Scholar). In the catalysis of the prolyl oligopeptidase variants, such a contribution has not been observed; the reduced activity was maintained over the entire pH range. The wild-type prolyl oligopeptidase exhibits similar activities toward the Z-Gly-Pro-Nap and an octapeptide substrate (Table III). As shown above, the rate constants for the reaction of the modified enzymes with Z-Gly-Pro-Nap diminish by 3 orders of magnitude (Table II). Unexpectedly, the D641A and D641N variants were 6 orders of magnitude less active (rate constants are 4.62 and 3.73m−1s−1, respectively) than that of the native enzyme toward the octapeptide (Table III). Crystallographic studies revealed that the binding of the octapeptide is unaffected by the Asp641 mutation (data are not shown). The dramatic difference in activity implies that the contribution of the histidine residue is negligible to the catalysis of both enzyme variants. A similarly large decrease, i.e. 6 orders of magnitude, was found in the reaction of subtilisin with suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-Nan, when the catalytic histidine was eliminated by replacement with an alanine (43Carter P. Wells J.A.

Open table in a new tab As for the D641N and D641A enzyme variants, the different rates of hydrolysis of the octapeptide and the naphthylamide substrates may arise from the greater strength of the peptide bond compared with the strength of the scissile bond of the naphthylamide substrate. Apparently, the defective active site is less effective against the stronger bond. As mentioned above, it is the catalysis, not the binding, that is impaired. Indeed, the K m values are similar for the reactions of the wild-type enzyme and its variants when tested with Z-Gly-Pro-Nap (Table III). The K m values were shown to approach K s, the enzyme-substrate dissociation constant with peptide and amide substrates in the case of serine peptidases (10Polgár L. Mechanisms of Protease Action. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 87-122Google Scholar, 11Polgár L. New Compr. Biochem. 1987; 16: 159-200Google Scholar). The binding of the octapeptide, not perturbed by a subsequent catalytic step, was measured by using an inactive variant (S554A) of prolyl oligopeptidase, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The determination exploited the internal quenching of the octapeptide, which was abolished upon binding to the peptidase (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2134599231,"Kinetic studies were performed to dissect the mechanism underlying the remarkable Mn2+ stimulation of the Dopa/tyrosine-sulfating activity of the human monoamine (M)-form phenol sulfotransferase (PST). The activities and the stimulation by Mn2+ are highly stereospecific for the d-form enantiomers of tyrosine and Dopa. Analysis of the kinetic results strongly suggests that tyrosine-Mn2+ and tyrosine-Mn2+-tyrosine complexes are obligatory substrates, whereas Dopa-Mn2+ complexes may be better substrates than Dopa alone. This activation of the Dopa/tyrosine-sulfating activity of M-form PST by Mn2+ via complex formation between Mn2+ and the substrate is the first reported case of a regulatory mechanism in this important class of enzymes. Our previous studies using point-mutated M-form PSTs established that the Mn2+ (in the substrate-Mn2+ complex) exerts its stimulatory effect by binding predominantly to the Asp-86 residue at the active site. We present here further studies using dopamine as substrate to bolster this conclusion. The possible physiological implications of this rather unusual specificity for thed-amino acid and its derivatives and the stimulation by Mn2+ are discussed in the context of protective and detoxification mechanisms that may operate in neurodegenerative processes in the brain. The Mn2+ stimulation of the activity of M-form PST toward d-enantiomers of Dopa/tyrosine may have implications for other substrates (including chiral drugs) and for the other cytosolic sulfotransferases that are involved in the regulation of endogenous metabolites as well as in detoxification."
