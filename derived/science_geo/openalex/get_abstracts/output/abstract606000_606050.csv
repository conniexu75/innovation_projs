A singly bonded nitrogen, or nitrene, is exceptionally reactive and can insert itself into normally inert C–H bonds. If the nitrene forms next to a carbonyl center, though, it tends to react with the C–C bond on the other side instead. Hong et al. used theory to guide the design of an iridium catalyst that inhibits this rearrangement, steering the nitrene toward C–H insertion to form a variety of useful lactam rings.

Moriyama et al. found that ILC2s interact with the nervous system to modulate helminth immunity. ILC2s from the small intestine expressed the β 2 -adrenergic receptor (β 2 AR), which normally interacts with the neurotransmitter epinephrine. Inactivating β 2 AR resulted in lower helminth burden and more ILC2s, eosinophils, and type 2 cytokine production in mice. Conversely, treatment of helminth-infected mice with a β 2 AR agonist enhanced worm burden and reduced proliferation of ILC2s. Thus, β 2 AR negatively regulates ILC2-driven protective immunity.

https://openalex.org/W2789780246,"Engineering cytokine-receptor pairs Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is an important cytokine that helps T cells destroy tumors and virus-infected cells. IL-2 has great therapeutic promise but is limited by toxic side effects and its capacity to both activate and repress immune responses. Sockolosky et al. set out to improve IL-2–based immunotherapy by engineering synthetic IL-2–receptor pairs (i.e., IL-2 and its receptor, IL-2R) (see the Perspective by Mackall). Engineered complexes transmitted IL-2 signals but only interacted with each other and not with endogenous IL-2/IL-2R. Treatment of mice with IL-2 improved the ability of engineered T cells to reject tumors with no obvious side effects. This type of approach may provide a way to mitigate toxicities associated with some cytokine-based immunotherapies. Science , this issue p. 1037 ; see also p. 990"

Kaplanis et al. collected 86 million publicly available profiles from a crowd-sourced genealogy website and used them to examine the genetic architecture of human longevity and migration patterns (see the Perspective by Lussier and Keinan). Various models of inheritance suggested that life span is predominantly attributable to additive genetic effects, with a smaller component from dominant genetic inheritance. The data also suggested that relatedness between individuals is less attributable to advances in human transportation than to cultural changes. Science , this issue p. 171 ; see also p. 153"
https://openalex.org/W2630507339,"Topologically ordered phases are characterized by long-range quantum entanglement and fractional statistics rather than by symmetry breaking. First observed in a fractionally filled continuum Landau level, topological order has since been proposed to arise more generally at fractional filling of topologically non-trivial ""Chern"" bands. Here, we report the observation of gapped states at fractional filling of Harper-Hofstadter bands arising from the interplay of a magnetic field and a superlattice potential in a bilayer graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructure. We observe new phases at fractional filling of bands with Chern indices $\mathcal{C} = -1, \pm 2,$ and $\pm 3$. Some of these, in $\mathcal{C}=-1$ and $\mathcal{C}=2$ bands, are characterized by fractional Hall conductance---they are `fractional Chern insulators' and constitute a new example of topological order beyond Landau levels."

https://openalex.org/W2791857742,"A growing understanding of the molecular interactions between immune effector cells and target tumor cells, coupled with refined gene therapy approaches, are giving rise to novel cancer immunotherapeutics with remarkable efficacy in the clinic against both solid and liquid tumors. While immunotherapy holds tremendous promise for treatment of certain cancers, significant challenges remain in the clinical translation to many other types of cancers and also in minimizing adverse effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need for functional potency assays, in vitro and in vivo, that could model the complex interaction of immune cells with tumor cells and can be used to rapidly test the efficacy of different immunotherapy approaches, whether it is small molecule, biologics, cell therapies or combinations thereof. Herein we report the development of an xCELLigence real-time cytolytic in vitro potency assay that uses cellular impedance to continuously monitor the viability of target tumor cells while they are being subjected to different types of treatments. Specialized microtiter plates containing integrated gold microelectrodes enable the number, size, and surface attachment strength of adherent target tumor cells to be selectively monitored within a heterogeneous mixture that includes effector cells, antibodies, small molecules, etc. Through surface-tethering approach, the killing of liquid cancers can also be monitored. Using NK92 effector cells as example, results from RTCA potency assay are very well correlated with end point data from image-based assays as well as flow cytometry. Several effector cells, i.e., PBMC, NK, CAR-T were tested and validated as well as biological molecules such as Bi-specific T cell Engagers (BiTEs) targeting the EpCAM protein expressed on tumor cells and blocking antibodies against the immune checkpoint inhibitor PD-1. Using the specifically designed xCELLigence immunotherapy software, quantitative parameters such as KT50 (the amount of time it takes to kill 50% of the target tumor cells) and % cytolysis are calculated and used for comparing the relative efficacy of different reagents. In summary, our results demonstrate the xCELLigence platform to be well suited for potency assays, providing quantitative assessment with high reproducibility and a greatly simplified work flow."
https://openalex.org/W2790458332,"Background HIV Viral Load and Early Infant Diagnosis technologies in many high burden settings are restricted to centralized laboratory testing, leading to long result turnaround times and patient attrition. GeneXpert (Cepheid, CA, USA) is a polyvalent near point-of-care platform and is widely implemented for Xpert MTB/RIF diagnosis. This study sought to evaluate the operational feasibility of integrated HIV VL, EID and MTB/RIF testing in new GeneXpert platforms. Methods Whole blood samples were collected from consenting patients due for routine HIV VL testing and DBS samples from infants due for EID testing, at three rural health facilities in Zimbabwe. Sputum samples were collected from all individuals suspected of TB. GeneXpert testing was reserved for all EID, all TB suspects and priority HIV VL at each site. Blood samples were further sent to centralized laboratories for confirmatory testing. GeneXpert polyvalent testing results and patient outcomes, including infrastructural and logistical requirements are reported. The study was conducted over a 10-month period. Results The fully automated GeneXpert testing device, required minimal training and biosafety considerations. A total of 1,302 HIV VL, 277 EID and 1,581 MTB/RIF samples were tested on a four module GeneXpert platform in each study site. Xpert HIV-1 VL testing was prioritized for patients who presented with advanced HIV disease, pregnant women, adolescents and suspected ART failures patients. On average, the study sites had a GeneXpert utilization rate of 50.4% (Gutu Mission Hospital), 63.5% (Murambinda Mission Hospital) and 17.5% (Chimombe Rural Health Centre) per month. GeneXpert polyvalent testing error rates remained lower than 4% in all sites. Decentralized EID and VL testing on Xpert had shorter overall median TAT (1 day [IQR: 0–4] and 1 day [IQR: 0–1] respectively) compared to centralized testing (17 days [IQR: 13–21] and 26 days [IQR: 23–32] respectively). Among patients with VL >1000 copies/ml (73/640; 11.4%) at GMH health facility, median time to enhanced adherence counselling was 8 days and majority of those with documented outcomes had re-suppressed VL (20/32; 62.5%). Median time to ART initiation among Xpert EID positive infants at GMH was 1 day [IQR: 0–1]. Conclusion Implementation of near point-of-care GeneXpert platform for integrated multi-disease testing within district and sub-district healthcare settings is feasible and will increase access to VL, and EID testing to priority populations. Quality management systems including monitoring of performance indicators, together with regular on-site supervision are crucial, and near-POC test results must be promptly actioned-on by clinicians for patient management."

However, the biochemical pathways leading to protein carbamylation are incompletely characterized. This work demonstrates that the heme protein myeloperoxidase (MPO), which is secreted at high concentrations at inflammatory sites from stimulated neutrophils and monocytes, is able to catalyze the two-electron oxidation of cyanide to cyanate and promote the carbamylation of taurine, lysine, and low-density lipoproteins. We probed the role of cyanide as both electron donor and low-spin ligand by pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetic analyses and analyzed reaction products by MS. Moreover, we present two further pathways of carbamylation that involve reaction products of MPO, namely oxidation of cyanide by hypochlorous acid and reaction of thiocyanate with chloramines. Finally, using an in vivo approach with mice on a high-fat diet and carrying the human MPO gene, we found that during chronic exposure to cyanide, mimicking exposure to pollution and smoking, MPO promotes protein-bound accumulation of carbamyllysine (homocitrulline) in atheroma plaque, demonstrating a link between cyanide exposure and atheroma. In summary, our findings indicate that cyanide is a substrate for MPO and suggest an additional pathway for in vivo cyanate formation and protein carbamylation that involves MPO either directly or via its reaction products hypochlorous acid or chloramines.

In patients with renal disease, carbamylation of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) is considered as a nontraditional risk factor for cardiovascular insufficiency.

Upon exposure of LDL to either MPO/H2O2/−SCN or the potassium salt of −O–CN, protein recognition by LDL receptor was attenuated, whereas its interaction with the scavenger receptor SR-A1 was enhanced. A clear relationship between the plasma levels of protein-bound ɛ-carbamyllysine (Hcit) and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease could be established (7Wang Z. Nicholls S.J. Rodriguez E.R.

We hereafter demonstrate the existence of a new alternative mechanism for cyanate formation and potential protein carbamylation at sites of inflammation, according to the following reaction, which involves the hydrogen peroxide–mediated oxidation of cyanide (−CN) catalyzed by MPO (Reaction 1). HOOH+C−≡N→MPOO−C≡N+HOHReaction1 Cyanide is well known as a product of organic material combustion (10Mahernia S. Amanlou A. Kiaee G. Amanlou M.

Exposure to high concentrations results in death within seconds to minutes by impairment of dioxygen (O2) distribution within the body and inhibition of the respiratory electron transport chain in the mitochondria (12Cooper C.E. Brown G.C. The inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase by the gases carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide: chemical mechanism and physiological significance.J.

Five-coordinated ferric high-spin heme proteins (e.g. cytochrome c oxidase, methemoglobin, metmyoglobin, catalase, peroxidases, etc.) are its preferential targets. Cyanide, which at most biological pH levels is protonated (pKa = 9.14), binds as an anion to Fe(III) and transforms the corresponding heme protein into its six-coordinated low-spin (LS) form, thereby impeding the interaction with natural substrates (e.g. O2 or H2O2). The binding rates and complex equilibria involved are very variable. Typically, eukaryotic peroxidases (including MPO) and catalases bind cyanide rapidly (1.1 × 105 m−1 s−1 to 1.3 × 106 m−1 s−1) (13Marquez L.A. Dunford H.B.

So far, this LS complex formation has been thought to effectively block the redox chemistry of all heme enzymes without any exceptions (KD = 1–10 μm). However, the present study unequivocally demonstrates that cyanide can act both as ligand of MPO and electron donor to compound I of MPO. Myeloperoxidase is a unique oxidoreductase in human physiology. The reconstructed phylogeny of mammalian peroxidases indeed demonstrates that MPOs form a well-separated clade within the vertebrate peroxidases (i.e. Family 1 of the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily) (8Zamocky M. Jakopitsch C. Furtmüller P.G. Dunand C. Obinger C. The peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily: reconstructed evolution of critical enzymes of the innate immune system.Proteins. 2008; 72 (18247411): 589-60510.1002/prot.21950Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This superfamily also includes peroxidasins, peroxinectins, cyclooxygenases, and dual oxidases (8Zamocky M. Jakopitsch C. Furtmüller P.G. Dunand C. Obinger C.

Fig. 1A depicts the family of vertebrate peroxidases, with the clades of myeloperoxidases and eosinophil peroxidases (EPOs) being well separated from the other branches. Segregation of MPO is well reflected by its unique biophysical and biochemical properties (19Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Jantschko W. Helm J. Bogner M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Active site structure and catalytic mechanisms of human peroxidases.Arch. Biochem.

It participates in innate immune defense mechanisms through formation of microbicidal-reactive oxidants and diffusible radical species. Its unique substrate is chloride that is oxidized to antimicrobial hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Chloride oxidation is a thermodynamically challenging reaction that requires the formation of strong oxidizing redox intermediates (i.e. the so-called “compound I” formed by oxidation of ferric MPO by hydrogen peroxide) (Fig. 2A) (20Arnhold J. Monzani E. Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Casella L. Obinger C. Kinetics and thermodynamics of halide and nitrite oxidation by mammalian heme peroxidases.Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 2006: 3801-381110.1002/ejic.200600436Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The standard reduction potential of the couple compound I/MPO(III) (E°′ = 1.16 V) provides the driving force of this reaction (Fig. 2A). Moreover, as will be demonstrated below, it also uniquely enables MPO to oxidize cyanide to cyanate, thereby contributing to a so far unknown route for protein carbamylation. The presented data also suggest multiple pathways of cyanate formation and protein carbamylation that involve MPO either directly or its reaction products hypochlorous acid and/or chloramine. Experiments in mouse model demonstrate the relevance of these pathways in vivo as cyanide is directly metabolized and promotes accumulation of protein-bound Hcit in atheroma plaque.Figure 2Carbamylation promoted by the system MPO/H2O2/−CN system and MPO-typical reaction products. A, MPO-typical oxidation of chloride to hypochlorous acid (i.e. chlorination cycle). Ferric MPO (PorFe(III)) is oxidized to compound I (•+PorFe(IV)=O; oxoiron(IV) porphyrin radical), which is directly reduced to the resting state by chloride, thereby releasing hypochlorous acid (HOCl/−OCl). Hypochlorous acid mediates the oxidation of cyanide to cyanate and the formation of chloramines, which may be also involved in carbamylation by direct reaction with thiocyanate (NEW ASPECTS). B, two-electron oxidation of cyanide to cyanate by MPO compound I, thereby restoring the ferric protein and releasing cyanate (5.3 × 105 m−1 s−1; NEW ASPECTS). Ferric MPO binds cyanide, forming the low-spin complex (PorFe(III)-CN−, KD = 3.3 μm). Further MPO-typical reactions include the one-electron reduction of compound I to compound II by H2O2 (14Bolscher B.G. Wever R.

Fig. 1B clearly shows that 0.5 μm MPO consumes 100 μm H2O2 within 300 s in the presence of 100 μm cyanide, whereas no effect is observed under identical conditions with related enzymes, such as lactoperoxidase (LPO) and EPO. At lower cyanide concentrations (50–100 μm), MPO rapidly consumes H2O2, whereas the inhibitory effect is evident at higher concentrations (500–1000 μm; Fig. 1B). The slow H2O2 consumption observed in control experiments (absence of cyanide) is due to the well-known low (pseudo)catalase activity of mammalian peroxidases (20Arnhold J. Monzani E. Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Casella L. Obinger C. Kinetics and thermodynamics of halide and nitrite oxidation by mammalian heme peroxidases.Eur. J. Inorg.

The relevant redox intermediate involved in both reactions (compound I; i.e. an oxoiron(IV) porphyrin radical cation) is formed via a two-electron oxidation of the ferric enzyme (PorFe(III)) by H2O2. PorFe(III)+H2O2→k1P+·orFe(IV)=O+H2OReaction2 In two-electron transitions, compound I (about 50% hypochromicity of Soret band compared with ferric MPO) is directly reduced to ferric MPO (Soret band at 428 nm), whereas in one-electron transitions, compound II (Soret band at 456 nm) is formed. These reactions can easily be probed by sequential stopped-flow spectroscopy. Fig. 1C shows a representative series of spectra obtained by mixing 4 μm MPO compound I with 100 μm cyanide. The reaction is monophasic and linearly dependent on cyanide concentration. It rapidly forms a MPO species that had its Soret band at 456 nm, which could derive from either compound II or the LS complex between ferric MPO and cyanide (19Furtmüller P.G. Zederbauer M. Jantschko W. Helm J. Bogner M. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Active site structure and catalytic mechanisms of human peroxidases.Arch. Biochem.

The determined apparent bimolecular rate constant is (5.3 ± 0.5) × 105 m−1 s−1 at pH 7.0 and 25 °C. It is unlikely that cyanide mediates the reduction of compound I to compound II, because this reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable (see below). Moreover, the reaction of preformed compound II with cyanide probed in the sequential stopped-flow mode clearly demonstrated that compound II does not participate in the turnover of the MPO/H2O2/−CN system. By contrast, the observed spectral transition suggests the cyanide-mediated direct reduction of compound I to ferric MPO. The latter rapidly binds excess cyanide, forming the LS complex with Soret maximum at 456 nm (see also Figs. S4 and S5). For comparison, the reaction of cyanide with preformed compound I of LPO and EPO as well as horseradish peroxidase (a model plant-type peroxidase) was also investigated under identical conditions. With LPO and EPO, compound I is slowly transformed to compound II (2 s−1), which is a well-known phenomenon of intramolecular electron transport in the absence of exogenous electron donors (21Jantschko W.

Horseradish peroxidase compound I is stable in the presence of cyanide (see Fig. S1B). To prove direct reduction of compound I to ferric MPO and concomitant two-electron oxidation of cyanide to −OCN, MPO was incubated with both H2O2 and the isotopomers −CN, [13C]−CN, or [13C,15N]−CN. The reaction products were analyzed by MS. Fig. 3 shows the formation of a reaction product with an appropriate m/z (i.e. m/z = 43) and a fragment ion at m/z = 27. Fig. 4A illustrates the formation of cyanate using the three isotopomers. Upon using −CN, [13C]−CN, or [13C,15N]−CN, peaks at m/z values of 41.999, 43.002, or 43.999 were found, clearly demonstrating the formation of the isotopomers −OCN, [13C]−OCN or [13C,15N]−OCN, respectively. In the absence of cyanide or hydrogen peroxide or MPO, no cyanate was produced except for hydrogen peroxide with cyanide, where a low cyanate production was detected (around 1%). Furthermore, using a calibration curve of cyanate, we were able to calculate that around 13% of cyanide is transformed to cyanate (n = 3) after 1 h (see supporting data for detailed results). These findings clearly indicate that the system MPO/H2O2/cyanide is able to produce cyanate and that the conversion of cyanide to cyanate is incomplete (Fig. 4A).Figure 4Mass spectrometric analyses. A, oxidation of cyanide by the MPO/H2O2 system. The isotopomers of −CN (final concentration = 1 mm) were mixed with H2O2 (1 mm) in 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.4, and the reaction was started with 0.3 μm human recombinant MPO at 37 °C with a reaction time of 1 h. −OCN, −O13CN, and −O13C15N peaks (at 41.9997, 43.0030, and 43.9999 m/z, respectively) could be detected, which correspond to the oxidation products of cyanide isotopes. Spectra have been generated by subtracting spectra of a blank (buffer alone). B, taurine carbamylation. Taurine (1 mm) was mixed with 0.3 μm human recombinant MPO and isotopic cyanide (1 mm) for 12 h (37 °C) in 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.4, and the reaction was started with 1 mm H2O2. A peak was detected at m/z of 167.0109, which corresponds to [12C]carbamyltaurine and MS/MS spectra fit with those of the control. In similar experiments with isotopomers, peaks were detected at m/z = 168.0284 and 169.0155, which correspond to 13C- and 13C,15N-labeled carbamyltaurine.

Peaks detected at m/z values 167.0115 and 168.0160 correspond to 12C- and 13C-labeled carbamyltaurine (absent in the taurine chloramine MS spectra). Their identity was confirmed by MS/MS experiments (D, inset).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furthermore, cyanate produced by MPO-mediated cyanide oxidation was probed in its reaction with nucleophilic amino groups in both taurine and lysine. Taurine is a low-molecular weight amine abundant in millimolar concentration in the cytosol of neutrophils (24Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Melton D.F. Thomas E.L. Chlorination of endogenous amines by isolated neutrophils. Ammonia-dependent bactericidal, cytotoxic, and cytolytic activities of the chloramines.J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259 (6381484): 10404-10413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, taurine was used as a chemical model of monoamine because it is stable and its chlorination is well documented. Taurine (1 mm) was incubated with MPO (0.3 μm), hydrogen peroxide (1 mm) and [12C]−CN, [13C]−CN, or [13C,15N]−CN (1 mm) in ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.4, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI)-quadrupole TOF (QTOF) MS in negative mode. Peaks at expected m/z values of 167.0109, 168.0284, and 169.0155 corresponding to 12C-, 13C-, and 13C,15N-carbamylated taurine were found (Fig. 4B). To further confirm the formation of carbamylated taurine, the isolated peaks were fragmented, leading to peaks with m/z values of 124.0074 and 79.9581, respectively, that fully matched with fragments obtained from standard carbamylated taurine (Fig. 4C). Similar experiments performed with lysine demonstrated the formation of Hcit (Fig. S2). In the absence of either hydrogen peroxide or MPO, carbamylation of taurine or lysine was negligible or diminished. Another tested target for carbamylation was LDL. LDLs were incubated with the MPO/H2O2/cyanide system before being delipidated and hydrolyzed. Subsequently, the formation of protein-bound Hcit was analyzed by MS and correlated with the abundance of protein-bound lysine by monitoring the ratio Hcit/Lys. A low amount of Hcit was detected in native LDLs. The incubation of LDLs with MPO, H2O2, and increasing concentrations of cyanide led to increasing Hcit/Lys ratios (1.5- and 12-fold increases; Fig. 5A). The addition of chloride (150 mm) to the MPO/H2O2 system in the presence of 100 μm cyanide even increased the extent of carbamylation. Similar levels of carbamylation were observed when LDLs were incubated with HOCl and cyanide (100 μm) (Fig. 5A). In the absence of MPO, the Hcit concentration was almost identical to that of native LDLs (data not shown). Furthermore, a positive control with 100 μm of cyanate (−OCN) was analyzed. This concentration was used supposing the full conversion of cyanide to cyanate. Surprisingly, this experiment showed a lower carbamylation compared with the MPO/H2O2/cyanide/chloride system but a 3 times higher carbamylation when compared with the MPO/H2O2/cyanide system (Fig. 5A). The quantitative approach of Hcit formation enabled us to observe that approximately 0.7% of thiocyanate (100 μm) mediated the formation of Hcit in the presence of MPO and H2O2. When cyanide was added in the same concentration as thiocyanate (100 μm), the thiocyanate-mediated formation of Hcit decreased to 0.35%; however, the cyanide-mediated formation of Hcit increased to 0.7%. If the thiocyanate concentration was increased to 400 μm, the thiocyanate-mediated formation of Hcit increased to 0.4%, whereas the cyanide-mediated formation decreased to 0.4%. These results highlight the importance of generated HOCl for the Hcit formation mediated by cyanide. Finally, the positive control using cyanate to carbamylate LDLs at 100 μm revealed that only 0.1% of cyanate was converted into Hcit under the conditions used. Finally, we tested the contribution of each anion (thiocyanate, cyanide, and chloride) in the carbamylation process. Upon the addition of cyanide to the system MPO/H2O2/thiocyanate, the contribution of thiocyanate in the carbamylation process decreased (Fig. 5B, left). However, this was compensated by cyanide-mediated carbamylation, as illustrated by an increase of labeled and total Hcit content (labeled and not labeled; Fig. 5, B (right) and C). Interestingly, when chloride (150 mm) was added in addition to cyanide to the MPO/H2O2/thiocyanate system, there was a drop in the formation of Hcit from thiocyanate (Fig. 5B, left). However, the total carbamylation content increased (total Hcit; Fig. 5B, right) as cyanide-dependent formation of Hcit (Fig. 5C) increased. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is an important reaction product of MPO deriving from the two-"

Fleming-Davies et al. asked what happens in a natural system. In the United States, the house finch population is suffering an increasingly virulent epidemic caused by Mycoplasma gallisepticum . The pathogen induces incomplete immunity that clears less virulent pathogens and offers partial protection against strains of greater virulence. In the birds, the partial immune response does away with competition from the less virulent pathogens. The partial immunity of the host also hinders replication of the more virulent pathogens enough to allow some birds to survive. This allows increasingly virulent forms of the pathogen to be transmitted. Science , this issue p. 1030"
https://openalex.org/W2792530251,"Context and objective In the estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), ethnicity is an important determinant. However, all existing equations have been built solely from Caucasian and Afro-American populations and they are potentially inaccurate for estimating GFR in African populations. We therefore evaluated the performance of different estimated GFR (eGFR) equations in predicting measured GFR (mGFR). Methods In a cross-sectional study, 93 healthy adults were randomly selected in the general population of Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, between June 2015 and April 2016. We compared mGFR by plasma clearance of iohexol with eGFR obtained with the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation with and without ethnic factor, the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) serum creatinine (SCr)-based equation, with and without ethnic factor, the cystatin C-based CKD-EPI equation (CKD-EPI SCys) and with the combined equation (CKD-EPI SCrCys) with and without ethnic factor. The performance of the equations was studied by calculating bias, precision and accuracy within 30% (P30) of mGFR. Results There were 48 women and 45 men. Their mean age was 45.0±15.7 years and the average body surface area was 1.68±0.16m2. Mean mGFR was 92.0±17.2 mL/min/1.73m2 (range of 57 to 141 mL/min/1.73m2). Mean eGFRs with the different equations were 105.5±30.1 and 87.2±24.8 mL/min/1.73m2 for MDRD with and without ethnic factor, respectively; 108.8±24.1 and 94.3x20.9 mL/min/1.73m2 for CKD-EPI SCr with and without ethnic factor, respectively, 93.5±18.6 mL/min/1.73m2 for CKD-EPI SCys; 93.5±18.0 and 101±19.6 mL/min/ 1.73m2 for CKD-EPI SCrCys with and without ethnic factor, respectively. All equations slightly overestimated mGFR except MDRD without ethnic factor which underestimated by -3.8±23.0 mL/min /1.73m2. Both CKD-EPI SCr and MDRD with ethnic factors highly overestimated mGFR with a bias of 17.9±19.2 and 14.5±27.1 mL/min/1.73m2, respectively. There was a trend for better P30 for MDRD and CKD-EPI SCr without than with the ethnic factor [86.0% versus 79.6% for MDRD (p = 0.21) and 81.7% versus 73.1% for the CKD-EPI SCr equations (p = 0.057)]. CKD-EPI SCrCys and CKD-EPI SCys were more effective than creatinine-based equations. Conclusion In the Congolese healthy population, MDRD and CKD-EPI equations without ethnic factors had better performance than the same equations with ethnic factor. The equations using Cys C (alone or combined with SCr) performed better than the creatinine-based equations."

Using the eight founder strains and both sexes of the Collaborative Cross (C57BL/6J (B6), A/J, 129S1/SvImJ (129), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/HILtJ (NZO), PWK/PhJ (PWK), WSB/EiJ (WSB), and CAST/EiJ (CAST)), we investigated the genetic dependence of diabetes-related metabolic phenotypes and insulin secretion. We found that strain background is associated with an extraordinary range in body weight, plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and insulin secretion. Our whole-islet proteomic analysis of the eight mouse strains demonstrates that genetic background exerts a strong influence on the islet proteome that can be linked to the differences in diabetes-related metabolic phenotypes and insulin secretion. We computed protein modules consisting of highly correlated proteins that enrich for biological pathways and provide a searchable database of the islet protein expression profiles. To validate the data resource, we identified tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), a key enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, as a protein that is highly expressed in β-cells of PWK and CAST islets. We show that CAST islets synthesize elevated levels of dopamine, which suppresses insulin secretion. Prior studies, using only the B6 strain, concluded that adult mouse islets do not synthesize l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), the product of Th and precursor of dopamine. Thus, the choice of the CAST strain, guided by our islet proteomic survey, was crucial for these discoveries. In summary, we provide a valuable data resource to the research community, and show that proteomic analysis identified a strain-specific pathway by which dopamine synthesized in β-cells inhibits insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2789271127,"Overexpression of Cyclin E has been seen in many types of cancers. However, the underlying mechanism remains enigmatic. Herein, we identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 27 (USP27) as a Cyclin E interactor. We found that USP27 promoted Cyclin E stability by negatively regulating its ubiquitination. In addition, suppression of USP27 expression resulted in the inhibition of the growth, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, we detected a positive correlation between USP27 and Cyclin E expression in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Finally, we found that USP27 expression is inhibited by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment and USP27 depletion sensitizes Hep3B cells to 5-FU-induced apoptosis. USP27-mediated Cyclin E stabilization is involved in tumorigenesis, suggesting that targeting USP27 may represent a new therapeutic strategy to treat cancers with aberrant overexpression of Cyclin E protein."

Here, we describe the nanobody hC3Nb1 that binds to multiple functional states of C3 with subnanomolar affinity. The nanobody causes a complete shutdown of alternative pathway activity in human and murine serum when present in concentrations comparable with that of C3, and hC3Nb1 is shown to prevent proconvertase assembly, as well as binding of the C3 substrate to C3 convertases. Our crystal structure of the C3b-hC3Nb1 complex and functional experiments demonstrate that proconvertase formation is blocked by steric hindrance between the nanobody and an Asn-linked glycan on complement factor B. In addition, hC3Nb1 is shown to prevent factor H binding to C3b, rationalizing its inhibition of factor I activity. Our results identify hC3Nb1 as a versatile, inexpensive, and powerful inhibitor of the alternative pathway in both human and murine in vitro model systems of complement activation."

Co-cultivation of pancreatic islets with unstimulated peritoneal macrophages in the presence of palmitate (to induce lipotoxicity) and high glucose (to induce glucotoxicity) synergistically increased the expression and release of islet-produced S100A8 in a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-independent manner. Consistently, a significant increase in the expression of the S100a8 gene was observed in the islets of diabetic db/db mice. Furthermore, the islet-derived S100A8 induced TLR4-mediated inflammatory cytokine production by migrating macrophages. When human islet cells were co-cultured with U937 human monocyte cells, the palmitate treatment up-regulated S100A8 expression. This S100A8-mediated interaction between islets and macrophages evoked β-cell apoptosis, which was ameliorated by TLR4 inhibition in the macrophages or S100A8 neutralization in the pancreatic islets. Of note, both glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity triggered S100A8 secretion from the pancreatic islets, which in turn promoted macrophage infiltration of the islets.

https://openalex.org/W2792553846,"Objective Lung cancer is one of the deadliest malignancies. The immune checkpoint-blockade (ICB) tumor therapy has led to striking improvement of long-term survival for some lung cancer patients. However, the response rate of immunotherapy is still low for lung cancer. Studying the tumor microenvironment (TME) should shed light on improvement of immunotherapy of lung cancer. Interleukin-33 (IL-33), an “alarmin” cytokine, has been implicated in tumor associated immune responses and inflammatory diseases of the lung. The role of IL-33 in lung cancer progression, however, remains elusive. This study is designed to characterize IL-33 expression in lung tumor tissues and establish the clinical significance of IL-33 in non-small cell lung cancer lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and methods Tumor tissue specimens from patients suffering from NSCLC were analyzed for expression of IL-33 protein by immunohistochemistry and expression of IL-33 and ST2 mRNA by RT-quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR). The expression data were analyzed for their association with clinical and pathological parameters of NSCLC. In addition, the association between expression levels of IL-33 mRNA and patient survival was determined using 5 independent expression profiling datasets of human lung cancer. Results and conclusion The expression levels of IL-33 and ST2 were significantly down-regulated in both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung when compared to adjacent normal lung tissues. In addition, the level of IL-33 protein was inversely correlated with tumor grade and size. Moreover, analysis of TCGA and GEO lung cancer expression datasets revealed that higher expression levels of IL-33 mRNA were correlated with longer overall survival of patients suffering from adenocarcinoma of the lung. These data indicate that the expression levels of IL-33 are inversely associated with lung cancer progression, consistent with the hypothesis that IL-33 is involved in immune surveillance of NSCLC."

One of the hallmarks of EED is villus damage. In children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) the severity of enteropathy is greater and short term mortality is high, but the metabolic consequences of enteropathy are unknown. Here, we characterize the urinary metabolic alterations associated with villus health, classic enteropathy biomarkers and anthropometric measurements in severely malnourished children in Zambia.We analysed 20 hospitalised children with acute malnutrition aged 6 to 23 months in Zambia. Small intestinal biopsies were assessed histologically (n = 15), anthropometric and gut function measurements were collected and the metabolic phenotypes were characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Endoscopy could not be performed on community controls children. Growth parameters were inversely correlated with enteropathy biomarkers (p = 0.011) and parameters of villus health were inversely correlated with translocation and permeability biomarkers (p = 0.000 and p = 0.015). Shorter villus height was associated with reduced abundance of metabolites related to gut microbial metabolism, energy and muscle metabolism (p = 0.034). Villus blunting was also related to increased sucrose excretion (p = 0.013).Intestinal villus blunting is associated with several metabolic perturbations in hospitalized children with severe undernutrition. Such alterations include altered muscle metabolism, reinforcing the link between EED and growth faltering, and a disruption in the biochemical exchange between the gut microbiota and host. These findings extend our understanding on the downstream consequences of villus blunting and provide novel non-invasive biomarkers of enteropathy dysfunction. The major limitations of this study are the lack of comparative control group and gut microbiota characterization."
https://openalex.org/W2789779205,"Chromatin consists of DNA and histones, and specific histone modifications that determine chromatin structure and activity are regulated by three types of proteins, called writer, reader, and eraser. Histone reader proteins from vertebrates, vertebrate-infecting parasites, and higher plants possess a CW domain, which has been reported to read histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). The CW domain of Arabidopsis SDG8 (also called ASHH2), a histone H3 lysine 36 methyltransferase, preferentially binds monomethylated H3K4 (H3K4me1), unlike the mammalian CW domain protein, which binds trimethylated H3K4 (H3K4me3). However, the molecular basis of the selective binding by the CW domain of SDG8 (SDG8-CW) remains unclear. Here, we solved the 1.6-Å-resolution structure of SDG8-CW in complex with H3K4me1, which revealed that residues in the C-terminal α-helix of SDG8-CW determine binding specificity for low methylation levels at H3K4. Moreover, substitutions of key residues, specifically Ile-915 and Asn-916, converted SDG8-CW binding preference from H3K4me1 to H3K4me3. Sequence alignment and mutagenesis studies revealed that the CW domain of SDG725, the homolog of SDG8 in rice, shares the same binding preference with SDG8-CW, indicating that preference for low methylated H3K4 by the CW domain of ASHH2 homologs is conserved among higher-order plants. Our findings provide first structural insights into the molecular basis for specific recognition of monomethylated H3K4 by the H3K4me1 reader protein SDG8 from Arabidopsis."
https://openalex.org/W2794379545,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a large class of regulatory RNAs with diverse roles in cellular processes. Thousands of lncRNAs have been discovered; however, their roles in the regulation of muscle differentiation are unclear because no comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs during this process has been performed. In the present study, by combining diverse RNA sequencing datasets obtained from public database, we discovered lncRNAs that could behave as regulators in the differentiation of smooth or skeletal muscle cells. These analyses confirmed the roles of previously reported lncRNAs in this process. Moreover, we discovered dozens of novel lncRNAs whose expression patterns suggested their possible involvement in the phenotypic switch of vascular smooth muscle cells. The comparison of lncRNA expression change suggested that many lncRNAs have common roles during the differentiation of smooth and skeletal muscles, while some lncRNAs may have opposite roles in this process. The expression change of lncRNAs was highly correlated with that of their neighboring genes, suggesting that they may function as cis-acting lncRNAs. Furthermore, within the lncRNA sequences, there were binding sites for miRNAs with expression levels inversely correlated with the expression of corresponding lncRNAs during differentiation, suggesting a possible role of these lncRNAs as competing endogenous RNAs. The lncRNAs identified in this study will be a useful resource for future studies of gene regulation during muscle differentiation."

We knocked down fascin1 expression with shRNA retrovirally transduced into a DLD-1 colon cancer and L929 fibroblast-like cell lines and used luciferase reporter assays and co-immunoprecipitation to identify fascin1 targets. We found that intracellular poly(I·C) transfection to mimic viral infection enhances the RIG-I/MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5)-mediated dimerization of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). The transfection also significantly increased the expression levels of IRF-7, interferon-β, and interferon-inducible cytokine IP-10 in fascin1-deleted cells compared with controls while significantly suppressing cell growth, migration, and invasion. We also found that fascin1 constitutively interacts with IκB kinase Ε (IKKΕ) in the RIG-I signaling pathway. In summary, we have identified fascin1 as a suppressor of the RIG-I signaling pathway associating with IκB kinase Ε in DLD-1 colon cancer cells to suppress immune responses to viral infection.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of resting heart rate on the recurrence of colorectal polyp, using long-term surveillance follow-up data of colorectal cancer survivors. Methods Three hundred patients were selected from the colorectal cancer survivor cohort of Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea. Resting heart rate, physical activity, and body composition analysis at the time of 5-year survival, and clinical data including colonoscopy surveillance results were collected for mean follow-up duration of 8 years. Results Patients with a high resting heart rate showed a significantly higher recurrence rate of advanced adenoma than those with a low resting heart rate (quartile 1, 45–66 beats per minute (b.p.m.); quartile 2, 67–73 b.p.m.; quartile 3, 74–80 b.p.m.; quartile 4, 81–120 b.p.m.; 3.8% vs. 7.9% vs. 10.0% vs. 14.7%, p for trend = 0.018). After adjustment for various risk factors, patients in the highest quartile of resting heart rate (≥ 81 b.p.m.) had a significantly higher risk of advanced adenoma recurrence (hazard ratio [HR]: 6.183, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.181–32.373, p = 0.031), compared to those in the lowest quartile (≤ 66 b.p.m.). In subgroup analysis, the association of resting heart rate with advanced adenoma recurrence appeared to be stronger among patients who had more than normal body fat mass or sedentary life style. Conclusions Elevated resting heart rate was independently associated with a higher rate of advanced adenoma recurrence in colorectal cancer survivors."
https://openalex.org/W2790498720,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a homotrimeric protein, is the eukaryotic sliding clamp that functions as a processivity factor for polymerases during DNA replication. Chromatin association factor 1 (CAF-1) is a heterotrimeric histone chaperone protein that is required for coupling chromatin assembly with DNA replication in eukaryotes. CAF-1 association with replicating DNA, and the targeting of newly synthesized histones to sites of DNA replication and repair requires its interaction with PCNA. Genetic studies have identified three mutant forms of PCNA in yeast that cause defects in gene silencing and exhibit altered association of CAF-1 to chromatin in vivo, as well as inhibit binding to CAF-1 in vitro. Three of these mutant forms of PCNA, encoded by the pol30-6, pol30-8, and the pol30-79 alleles, direct the synthesis of PCNA proteins with the amino acid substitutions D41A/D42A, R61A/D63A, and L126A/I128A, respectively. Interestingly, these double alanine substitutions are located far away from each other within the PCNA protein. To understand the structural basis of the interaction between PCNA and CAF-1 and how disruption of this interaction leads to reduced gene silencing, we determined the X-ray crystal structures of each of these mutant PCNA proteins. All three of the substitutions caused disruptions of a surface cavity on the front face of the PCNA ring, which is formed in part by three loops comprised of residues 21–24, 41–44, and 118–134. We suggest that this cavity is a novel binding pocket required for the interaction between PCNA and CAF-1, and that this region in PCNA also represents a potential binding site for other PCNA-binding proteins."

We asked whether the structure and function of a broad neutralizing antibody (bNAb) epitope, the membrane-proximal ectodomain region (MPER) of the viral gp41 transmembrane glycoprotein, differ in cell-free and cell–cell-transmitted viruses and whether this difference could be related to Ab neutralization sensitivity. Whereas cell-free viruses bearing W666A and I675A substitutions in the MPER lacked infectivity, cell-associated mutant viruses were able to initiate robust spreading infection. Infectivity was restored to cell-free viruses by additional substitutions in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of gp41 known to disrupt interactions with the viral matrix protein. We observed contrasting effects on cell-free virus infectivity when W666A was introduced to two transmitted/founder isolates, but both mutants could still mediate cell–cell spread. Domain swapping indicated that the disparate W666A phenotypes of the cell-free transmitted/founder viruses are controlled by sequences in variable regions 1, 2, and 4 of gp120. The sequential passaging of an MPER mutant (W672A) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells enabled selection of viral revertants with loss-of-glycan suppressor mutations in variable region 1, suggesting a functional interaction between variable region 1 and the MPER. An MPER-directed bNAb neutralized cell-free virus but not cell–cell viral spread. Our results suggest that the MPER of cell–cell-transmitted virions has a malleable structure that tolerates mutagenic disruption but is not accessible to bNAbs. In cell-free virions, interactions mediated by the CT impose an alternative MPER structure that is less tolerant of mutagenic alteration and is efficiently targeted by bNAbs.

https://openalex.org/W2789236694,"Since the 2008 financial crisis, agent-based models (ABMs), which account for out-of-equilibrium dynamics, heterogeneous preferences, time horizons and strategies, have often been envisioned as the new frontier that could revolutionise and displace the more standard models and tools in economics. However, their adoption and generalisation is drastically hindered by the absence of general reliable operational calibration methods. Here, we start with a different calibration angle that qualifies an ABM for its ability to achieve abnormal trading performance with respect to the buy-and-hold strategy when fed with real financial data. Starting from the common definition of standard minority and majority agents with binary strategies, we prove their equivalence to optimal decision trees. This efficient representation allows us to exhaustively test all meaningful single agent models for their potential anomalous investment performance, which we apply to the NASDAQ Composite index over the last 20 years. We uncover large significant predictive power, with anomalous Sharpe ratio and directional accuracy, in particular during the dotcom bubble and crash and the 2008 financial crisis. A principal component analysis reveals transient convergence between the anomalous minority and majority models. A novel combination of the optimal single-agent models of both classes into a two-agents model leads to remarkable superior investment performance, especially during the periods of bubbles and crashes. Our design opens the field of ABMs to construct novel types of advanced warning systems of market crises, based on the emergent collective intelligence of ABMs built on carefully designed optimal decision trees that can be reversed engineered from real financial data."

Here, we show that hsa-miR-1225-3p is specifically down-regulated by type I IFN through the IFN/JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Silencing endogenous miR-1225-3p inhibited infection by multiple IFN-susceptible viruses, including hepatitis C virus, Sendai virus, and Newcastle disease virus. In contrast, overexpression of miR-1225-3p impaired the antiviral effect of IFNs and facilitated viral infection. Regarding the mechanism, we identified growth factor receptor–bound protein 2–associated binding protein 3 (GAB3) as a direct target of miR-1225-3p. GAB3 expression was up-regulated by IFN, and overexpression of GAB3 demonstrated potent antiviral effects through enhancing IFN response and virus-triggered innate immune activation.

https://openalex.org/W2794343635,"Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone can cause an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) in some of the population, but not all. In this paper we used a mouse model of glucocorticoid induced ocular hypertension to examine the changes in the anterior segment of the eye in mice that failed to respond to glucocorticoid treatment with a sustained increase in IOP. C57BL/6J mice were treated with either 0.1% dexamethasone sodium phosphate ophthalmic solution or sterile PBS 3 times daily for up to 5 weeks. IOP was measured weekly at approximately the same time of the day. After 3-5 weeks of treatment, eyes were enucleated and evaluated for changes associated with steroid induced glaucoma. These studies showed that IOP was significantly elevated in dexamethasone (DEX) treated mice compared to PBS treated mice after 3 weeks of treatment, but IOP in DEX treated mice returned to baseline levels after 5 weeks of treatment. All the mice demonstrated a response to the glucocorticoid treatments and showed an elevation in FKBP5 expression after both 3 and 5 weeks of DEX treatment (primary glucocorticoid response protein) and a weight loss. Western blot analysis of anterior segments from treated mice, however, did not show an increase in secondary glucocorticoid response proteins such as β3 integrin or myocilin. Fibronectin levels were also not statistically different. The data suggest that in mice, which do not exhibit a prolonged increase in IOP in response to the DEX treatment, there is a compensatory mechanism that can prevent or turn off the secondary glucocorticoid response."
https://openalex.org/W2791294996,"Prediction of adverse drug reactions is an important problem in drug discovery endeavors which can be addressed with data-driven strategies. SIDER is one of the most reliable and frequently used datasets for identification of key features as well as building machine learning models for side effects prediction. The inherently unbalanced nature of this data presents with a difficult multi-label multi-class problem towards prediction of drug side effects. We highlight the intrinsic issue with SIDER data and methodological flaws in relying on performance measures such as AUC while attempting to predict side effects.We argue for the use of metrics that are robust to class imbalance for evaluation of classifiers. Importantly, we present a 'hierarchical anatomical classification schema' which aggregates side effects into organs, sub-systems, and systems. With the help of a weighted performance measure, using 5-fold cross-validation we show that this strategy facilitates biologically meaningful side effects prediction at different levels of anatomical hierarchy. By implementing various machine learning classifiers we show that Random Forest model yields best classification accuracy at each level of coarse-graining. The manually curated, hierarchical schema for side effects can also serve as the basis of future studies towards prediction of adverse reactions and identification of key features linked to specific organ systems. Our study provides a strategy for hierarchical classification of side effects rooted in the anatomy and can pave the way for calibrated expert systems for multi-level prediction of side effects."

A more precise time standard might improve the navigation of spacecraft and help experimenters look for variations in fundamental constants that would signal new physics. So the push is on to replace current clocks, which are tuned to a specific microwave frequency, with even better clocks that exploit higher-frequency visible light. In a paper out last month, a group of experts set up by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sevres, France, lays out a road map for the steps needed to redefine the unit of time—the metric second—in terms of optical radiation.

The absence of auditory input in deafness is understood to have a significant, and even irreversible, impact on these processes. The ability to map touch on the body is an important element of body-related processing. In this research, the crossed-arm temporal order judgment (TOJ) task was used to evaluate the spatial mapping of touch. This task elicits a conflict between visual and somatosensory body-related information through a change in posture. We used the crossed-arm TOJ task to evaluate the spatial mapping of touch in deaf participants. Results suggested that a change in posture had a greater impact on congenitally deaf participant TOJ than for hearing participants. This provides the first evidence for the role of early auditory exposure on spatial mapping of touch. More importantly, most deaf participants had auditory prosthetics which provided auditory input. This suggests an important, and possibly irreversible, impact of early auditory deprivation on this body-related process."
https://openalex.org/W2790979306,"CD4+ T cells are essential players for the control of mycobacterial infections. Several mycobacterial antigens have been identified for eliciting a relevant CD4+ T cell mediated-immune response, and numerous studies explored this issue in the context of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Antigen 85 (Ag85), a highly conserved protein across Mycobacterium species, is secreted at the early phase of M. tuberculosis infection leading to the proliferation of Ag85-specific CD4+ T cells. However, in the context of Mycobacterium avium infection, little is known about the expression of this antigen and the elicited immune response. In the current work, we investigated if a T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire mostly, but not exclusively, directed at Ag85 is sufficient to mount a protective immune response against M. avium. We show that P25 mice, whose majority of T cells express a transgenic TCR specific for Ag85, control M. avium infection at the same level as wild type (WT) mice up to 20 weeks post-infection (wpi). During M. avium infection, Ag85 antigen is easily detected in the liver of 20 wpi mice by immunohistochemistry. In spite of the propensity of P25 CD4+ T cells to produce higher amounts of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) upon ex vivo stimulation, no differences in serum IFNγ levels are detected in P25 compared to WT mice, nor enhanced immunopathology is detected in P25 mice. These results indicate that a T cell response dominated by Ag85-specific T cells is appropriate to control M. avium infection with no signs of immunopathology."

Multiplex Luminex technology results showed a normal induction of five quantified cytokines (interferon γ, interleukin(IL)12, IL17, IL10, and tumor necrosis factor α) in SLE patients compared to HCs upon stimulation with CMVpp52 and HHV6p41. However, flow cytometric results showed a reduced upregulation of the activation marker CD69 on T-cells from SLE patients (n = 17) compared to HCs (n = 17) upon stimulation with CMVpp52, indicating limited or defective CMVpp52-specific T-cells and/or poor antigen-presentation in SLE patients, and thereby possibly decreased control of the CMV infection. In conclusion, the dysfunctional immune response against EBV previously established in SLE patients does not seem to apply to the same degree regarding the immune responses against CMV or HHV6. Results designate that the main contributing HHV agent in development or exacerbation of SLE (in genetically predisposed individuals) is the previously determined uncontrolled EBV infection, and to a lesser extent CMV infection, and probably with no involvement of HHV6 infection."

Now, fish like the sea bream are adapting their age-old strategy to a modern challenge that also disrupts the sex balance: overfishing. Fishers favor the biggest catch. Because one sex is usually bigger than the other, the bigger sex risks being fished out. But researchers have found that sea breams, which are common in warmer Atlantic Ocean coastal waters, are ready. Removing big males prompts earlier-than-usual sex changes in some females, so the sex balance is preserved. Still, it9s more of a short-term strategy than a long-term solution, researchers say. The fish are switching sex at younger ages, making the newly minted males smaller. That trend translates into fewer offspring and a shrinking population.

Twice as strong as predicted, the absorption suggests the hydrogen was colder than previously thought and must have lost heat to dark matter, the only colder thing around. The dark matter particles must have been less than five times as massive as a hydrogen atom, argues one theorist, otherwise the atoms would have bounced off them without losing energy and getting colder, just as a Ping-Pong ball will bounce off a bowling ball without slowing down.

By investigating mortality trajectory, the rate of aging d(log(μ(x)))/dx of Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplants (HSCTs) patients who had underwent first-allogeneic transplants can be obtained, and to unveil the possibility of elasticity of human aging rate in HSCTs. A modified parametric frailty survival model was introduced to the survival profiles of 11,160 patients who had underwent first-allogeneic HSCTs in the United States between 1995 and 2006; data was shared by Center for International Bone and Marrow Transplant Research. In comparison to stratification, the modification permits two entities in relation to time to be presented; age and calendar time. To consider its application in empirical studies, the data contains arbitrary right-censoring, a statistical condition which is preferred by choice in many transplant studies. The finalized multivariate AFT model was adjusted for clinical and demographic covariates, and age-specific mortality trajectories were presented by donor source and post-transplant time-lapse intervals. Two unexpected findings are presented: i) an inverse J-shaped hazard in unrelated donor-source t≤100-day; ii) convergence of unrelated-related hazard lines in 100-day<t ≤ 365-day suggests maximum manifestation of senescence among survivors. Analyses of long-term survivors (t>365-day) must consider for periodic medical improvements, and transplant year as a standalone time-variable is not sufficient for statistical adjustment in the finalized multivariate model. In relevance to clinical studies, biennial event-history analysis and age-specific mortality trajectories of long-term survivors provide a more relevant intervention audit report for transplant protocols than the popular statistical presentation; i.e. survival probabilities among donor-source."
