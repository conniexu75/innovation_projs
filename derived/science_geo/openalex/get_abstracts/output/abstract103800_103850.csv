https://openalex.org/W2038449972,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent angiogenic factor and endothelial cell-specific mitogen, is up-regulated by hypoxia. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for hypoxic induction of VEGF has not been clearly delineated. We report that the steady state VEGF mRNA levels are increased 12 ± 0.6-fold, but the transcriptional rate for VEGF is increased only 3.1 ± 0.6-fold by hypoxia in PC12 cells. In order to investigate cis-regulatory sequences which mediate this response to hypoxia, we cloned the rat genomic sequences encoding VEGF and identified a 28-base pair element in the 5′ promoter that mediates hypoxia-inducible transcription in transient expression assays. This element has sequence and protein binding similarities to the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 binding site within the erythropoietin 3′ enhancer. Post-transcriptional mechanisms have also been suggested to play a role in the hypoxic induction of VEGF. Evidence is provided that a frequently used polyadenylation site is 1.9 kilobases downstream from the translation termination codon for rat VEGF. This site is 1.5 kilobases further downstream from the polyadenylation site previously reported for VEGF. This new finding reveals sequence motifs in the 3′-untranslated region that may mediate VEGF mRNA stability.

Increased respiratory rate (1Gonfurnino M. Lopez-Barneo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Karger, Basel1989: 2-6Google Scholar) have been recognized as important adaptations to a reduced environmental oxygen tension. Similarly, at the level of a given tissue or organ, new blood vessel formation has been recognized as an adaptive response to cellular hypoxia (3Adair T.H. Gay W.J. Montani J.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: R393-R404PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia has been shown to be a very important stimulus for the new vessel formation seen in coronary artery disease (4Sabri M.N. DiSciascio G.

This hypoxic induction of VEGF is due to an increase in the steady state level of the mRNA for VEGF (6Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E.

The VEGF gene is induced by hypoxia with characteristics that resemble the hypoxic induction of the erythropoietin (Epo) gene (11Goldberg M.A. Schneider T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4355-4359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Loscalzo J. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Yeo K.-T. Koren G. Colucci W. Goldberg M. Circ. Res. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Expression of both genes is induced by cobalt and manganese, but not by cyanide or azide, and hypoxic induction is inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (6Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar) The implication of these studies is that there may be fundamental similarities in the oxygen sensing pathway leading to the activation of these two genes. The hypoxic induction of the Epo gene appears to be regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (16Schuster S.J. Badiavas E.V. Costo-Giomoi P. Weinmann R. Erslav A.J. Caro J. Blood. 1989; 73: 13-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Goldberg M.A. Gaut C.C. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1991; 77: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rondon I.J. MacMillan L.A. Beckman B.S.

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) has been identified as one of the proteins that specifically binds to an enhancer element 3′ to the Epo gene in a hypoxia-regulated fashion (19Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar, 20Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Functional HIF-1 sites have recently also been reported in a number of hypoxia-regulated genes, namely the genes for the enzymes phosphoglycerate kinase 1, lactate dehydrogenase A, aldolase A, phosphofructokinase L, enolase 1, and pyruvate kinase M (21Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We have sought to elucidate the mechanism of the hypoxic induction of VEGF steady state mRNA by several methods. First, nuclear runoff experiments were performed to measure the transcription rate of VEGF under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Second, in order to identify cis-regulatory elements that mediate transcriptional activation of VEGF by hypoxia, rat genomic sequences for VEGF were cloned, and the promoter was analyzed using transient transfection reporter assays. The sequence and protein binding characteristics of one such regulatory element are described and compared to the hypoxia regulatory element within the Epo 3′ enhancer. Finally, the apparent discrepancy between the size of VEGF mRNA by Northern blot analysis and the published transcription termination site (8Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4450) Google Scholar, 23Keck P.J. Hauser S.D. Krivi G. Sanzo K. Warren T. Feder J. Connolly D.T. Science. 1989; 246: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar) for VEGF mRNA is clarified. The role of sequence motifs in the 3′-untranslated region that are revealed by these studies are discussed with regard to their ability to mediate changes in mRNA stability. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells were the generous gift of Dr. Eva J. Neer (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). The cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal bovine serum and used for all experiments at ~70% confluence. Cells were cultured under either normoxic conditions (5% CO2, 20% O2, 75% N2) in a humidified Napco incubator at 37°C or hypoxic conditions (5% CO2, 1% O2, 94% N2) in a ESPEC triple gas incubator (Tabai-Espec Corp., Osaka, Japan). 3 × 106 bacteriophage clones from a Lambda-DASH (Stratagene) 8-week-old rat Sprague-Dawley genomic library were screened with a cDNA probe corresponding to VEGF23, a novel VEGF isoform that contains exon 1 spliced to exon 8 (12Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Loscalzo J. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Yeo K.-T. Koren G. Colucci W. Goldberg M. Circ. Res. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Secondary and tertiary screening of the genomic clones were performed using exon 1 (NL23, 5′AACCATGAACTTTCTCTCTT3′) or exon 8 (NL24, 5′GGTGAGAGGTCTAGTTCCCGA3′) oligonucleotides derived from the nucleotide sequence of rat VEGF cDNA. Distinct VEGF genomic clones hybridizing to NL23 or NL24 were isolated. Bacteriophage DNA from each 5′ or 3′ bacteriophage clone was purified, digested with PstI, and cloned into a Bluescript vector (Stratagene) generating a PstI library of the 5′ or 3′ region of the VEGF gene, respectively. This PstI library was then screened with [γ-32P]NL23 or [γ-32P]NL24 oligonucleotides. This approach yielded a 3.0-kb PstI fragment (clone 5.1) and a 2.2-kb PstI fragment (clone 11.4) from the 5′ and 3′ regions of the VEGF gene, respectively. Sequences were obtained 5′ to clone 5.1 by screening an EcoRI library generated from the original bacteriophage clones as described above using an oligonucleotide from the most 5′ sequence of clone 5.1 to screen the EcoRI library. A 10-kb EcoRI fragment overlapping with the PstI fragment from clone 5.1 was obtained by this strategy (clone 5EPst). An oligonucleotide complementary to the most 5′ sequence of clone 5.1 was used to sequence across the PstI site of clone 5EPst. Sequences 5′ to the PstI site were then used to screen the original PstI library and yielded a 6.0-kb PstI fragment that maps immediately 5′ to clone 5.1. Sequences were obtained 3′ to clone 11.4 by constructing an EcoRI R1 library from the 3′ bacteriophage clone and then screening the library with an oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′-most region of clone 11.4. Using this strategy, a 3.8-kb EcoRI fragment (clone 11.36) was identified. Sequencing of these clones was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method using Sequenase (Stratagene) initially with T3 and T7 primers and subsequently, in a progressive fashion, with oligonucleotides complementary to the sequences obtained from the respective clones. Both strands of all clones were sequenced. Nuclei were obtained and assays were performed by a modification of previously described procedures (24Greenberg M.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994: 4.10.1-4.10.9Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and nuclei were resuspended in 175 μl of glycerol storage buffer (40% glycerol, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 80 mM KCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA) and stored in liquid N2. Eight μl of 100 mM solutions of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 20 μl of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN), and 1 μl of 100 mM dithiothreitol were added to the nuclear suspension, and the transcription runoff was allowed to proceed at 30°C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated with the addition of DNase I (300 units) and CaCl2 (final concentration of 1 mM) and then incubated at 30°C for an additional 10 min. One μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and 25 μl of SET (5% SDS, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Subsequently, 550 μl of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate and 90 μl of 3 M NaOAc were added, and the mixture was extracted once with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). The aqueous phase was removed, and the RNA was precipitated with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of guanidinium isothiocyanate, and the RNA was reprecipitated with 1 volume of isopropyl alcohol. The pellet was washed once with 70% ethanol, dissolved in 100 μl of TES (10 mM Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS), and used directly for hybridization. Nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher and Schuell) were prepared in a DNA slot blot apparatus with 5 μg of DNA that was previously denatured with 0.2 M NaOH. The prehybridization and hybridization solutions consisted of 50% formamide, 5 × SSC (0.15 M NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate), 1 × Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 100 μg/ml tRNA, and 0.375% SDS. Hybridization was carried out at 42°C for 2-3 days. Filters were washed at 65°C first in 2 × SSC with 0.1% SDS and then in 0.2 × SSC with 0.1% SDS prior to phosphorimaging and autoradiographic analysis. Murine actin cDNA cloned into Bluescript was used to normalize the VEGF hybridization signal. Bluescript vector without insert was used as a negative control. Rat VEGF gene transcription was assessed using a 900-bp PstI-SmaI fragment (nucleotides 990-1855, see Fig. 3) from the 5′-untranslated region of VEGF subcloned into Bluescript. Quantitation of the nuclear runoff assay was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Northern blots were performed as described previously (12Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Loscalzo J. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Yeo K.-T. Koren G. Colucci W. Goldberg M. Circ. Res. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was isolated as described previously (25Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of 10 μg of RNA/lane was performed in 1% agarose gels with 2.2 M formaldehyde and transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont NEN). After UV cross-linking the RNA to the membrane using a Stratalinker (Stratagene), the filters were prehybridized in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, and 150 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. cDNA or genomic DNA fragments used as probes were prepared by electroelution onto NA-45 paper (Schleicher and Schuell) from agarose gels. Fragments were labeled using random primer methodology (26Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5193) Google Scholar) (Pharmacia Biotech) to a specific activity of at least 1 × 109 cpm/μg of DNA. Hybridization was performed at 42°C for 16 h. The filters were then washed twice at 65°C with 2 × SSC and 1% SDS for 20 min each and subsequently washed twice at 65°C with 0.2 × SSC and 1% SDS for 20 min each. Hybridization with a γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to 18 S rRNA was performed as described previously (27Szyf M. Milstone D.S. Schimner B.P. Porter K.C. Seidman J.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1144-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and used to normalize for the amount of RNA in each lane. Total cellular RNA was isolated as described above. RNase protection assays utilizing riboprobes that are capable of distinguishing 4 VEGF isoforms were performed as described previously (12Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Loscalzo J. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Yeo K.-T. Koren G. Colucci W. Goldberg M. Circ. Res. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). In order to map the 5′ transcription start site, a PstI-NruI (nucleotides 25-1040, see Fig. 3) fragment from the 5′ region was subcloned into Bluescript. Linearization of the plasmid with SmaI (nucleotide 887, see Fig. 3) and generation of an antisense riboprobe with T3 polymerase generated a riboprobe of 184 bases. The primer Pext5 (5′CTGCCGCCGCTCAGCTCGCCCC3′) was used to perform primer extension on RNA from normoxic or hypoxic cells according to published procedures (28Triezenberg S.J. Ausubel F.M. Brent F. Robert F. Kingston E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989: 4.8.1-4.8.5Google Scholar). Plasmids containing VEGF 5′-flanking sequences subcloned 5′ to the luciferase gene were constructed using the luciferase containing eukaryotic expression vectors pxp2 and pT109luc (29Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-456PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was transfected into cells by electroporation optimized at 280 V in a custom-made electroporation apparatus (30Chu G. Hayakawa H. Berg P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In all experiments, the test plasmid (40 μg) was transfected with 4 × 106 cells per cuvette (Bio-Rad). The cells in the cuvette were then split equally and randomly between two tissue culture plates destined to be incubated at 1% or 21% O2. After 1 h at 21% O2, the plates designated for hypoxia were transferred to the hypoxia apparatus and incubated in parallel with the plates remaining at 21% O2 for 14-16 h. Luciferase activity was then assayed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA) in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). A control plasmid was not co-transfected with the test plasmid. We have not found any significant difference in luciferase activity between PC12 cells grown under 1% or 21% O2 using mouse mammary tumor virus or SV40 promoter sequences directing the luciferase reporter gene introduced by electroporation and treated in the manner described above The electroporation and parallel culture conditions described above allow each pair of plates to be treated identically up to the point of placing the cells in the hypoxia apparatus, thus controlling for any difference in cell number distributed between the two plates or transfection efficiency (plating efficiency and cell viability did not differ between cells grown at 1% or 21% oxygen under the culture conditions used). Each test plasmid was transfected at least 10 separate times. Nuclear extracts from hypoxic and normoxic cells were prepared according to the protocol described by Andrews and Faller (31Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Based on VEGF 5′-flanking sequence (nucleotides 1-959), complementary oligonucleotides containing a HIF-like binding site and BamHI and SacI recognition sites on the ends (W28, 5′GATCCACAGTGCATACGTGGGCTTCCACAGAGCTC3′ and 5′CTGTGGAAGCCCACGTATGCACTGTG3′) were synthesized, annealed, and cloned into Bluescript. A construct was also prepared which was identical except that it contained a mutation in the HIF-like binding site (M28, 5′GATCCACAGTGCATCAATGGGCTTCCACAGAGCTC3′ and 5′CTGTGGAAGCCCATTGATGCACTGTG3′). The sequences were verified by DNA sequencing of both strands. This BamHI-SacI fragment was labeled with Klenow by filling in the 5′ overhang with [α-32P]dCTP. The labeled fragment was then electrophoresed on a 3% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, isolated on NA-45 paper, eluted with 1 M NaCl, and ethanol-precipitated. Ten thousand cpm (~0.2 ng) were used for each binding reaction. Binding assays were performed according to Semenza et al.(19Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar), using calf thymus DNA as a nonspecific competitor. Binding reactions contained 5 μg of nuclear extract, 0.1 μg of denatured calf thymus DNA (Sigma), 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The reactions were preincubated at room temperature with or without specific competitors for 5 min before the radiolabeled probe was added. Incubation was then continued for an additional 10 min at room temperature. Reaction products were electrophoresed at 4°C in a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.3 × TBE (30 mM Tris, 30 mM boric acid, 0.06 mM EDTA, pH 7.3 at 20°C). Competitor DNA was prepared by mixing equimolar quantities of the complementary oligonucleotides and was used at an ~100-fold molar excess relative to the radioactive probe. Epo18 oligonucleotides (22Firth J.D. Ebert B.L. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6496-6500Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) were 5′GCCCTACGTGCTGCCCTCG3′ and 5′CGAGGGCAGCACGTAGGGC3′ and were the generous gift of Drs. Eric Huang and H. Franklin Bunn (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). The AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides 5′CTAGTGAT-GAGTCAGCCGGATC3′ and 5′GATCCGGCTGACTCATCACTAG3′ were obtained from Stratagene and were used as a nonspecific competitor. VEGF mRNA has previously been demonstrated to be up-regulated in response to decreased O2 tension (6Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar) in all cell types and cell lines examined with the exception of endothelial cells (32Minchenko A.S.S. Bauer T. Caro J. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 35-39PubMed Google Scholar). The rat pheochromocytoma tumor cell line PC12 has previously been demonstrated to induce VEGF mRNA in response to a variety of activated second messenger systems (33Claffey K.P. Wilkison W.O. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16317-16322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates that VEGF mRNA is also up-regulated by hypoxia in the PC12 cells. After being grown for 6 h in 1% O2, the mRNA for VEGF is increased 12.0 ± 0.6-fold as determined by RNase protection assay. Analogous to primary cardiac myocytes (12Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Loscalzo J. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Yeo K.-T. Koren G. Colucci W. Goldberg M. Circ. Res. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), all four isoforms of VEGF mRNA are induced equivalently by hypoxia in PC12 cells as determined by RNase protection assay using isoform specific probes (data not shown). PC12 cells were grown at 1% or 21% oxygen tension for 6 h before nuclei were harvested for nuclear runoff assays as described under “Materials and Methods.” Murine β-actin, whose transcription rate has been previously demonstrated to be minimally changed by hypoxia (34Webster K.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1987; 77: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), was used to normalize the hybridization signal for each runoff assay. The transcription rate for VEGF was observed to increase 3.1 ± 0.6-fold (n = 7), p < 0.001 (Fig. 2), in cells grown under hypoxic conditions for 6 h compared to cells grown at 21% O2. Similar results were obtained when nuclei were harvested between 3 and 12 h. Rat VEGF genomic DNA was cloned from a bacteriophage library and sequenced as described under “Materials and Methods.” The nucleotide sequence of the 5′ region of the rat VEGF gene, including ~1 kb of 5′-untranslated and ~1 kb of 5′-flanking sequence, is shown in Fig. 3 aligned to the human VEGF sequence (35Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The overall homology in the 5′-flanking and -untranslated region was greater than 79%. Ten potential HIF-1 sites were identified with a 6/8- or 7/8-bp match to the Epo HIF-1 site in the 5′-flanking region. None of the potential HIF-1 sites conforms to the consensus sequence recently proposed by Semenza et al.(21Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.M. Wang G.L. J. Biol.

The position of only one of these possible HIF-1 sites (5′TACGTGGG3′, nucleotides 65-72, Fig. 3) is conserved between the rat and human genes and is located within a 28-bp region that is 100% conserved between rat and human VEGF. A 5-bp element, 5′CACAG3′, is present in the Epo enhancer element and is located 4 nucleotides 3′ to the HIF-1 site. This element, which is absolutely required for hypoxic induction of Epo (21Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is also present 4 nucleotides 3′ to the conserved putative HIF-1 site in the VEGF 5′-flanking region. A single consensus AP-1 site is conserved and is found 28 bp 3′ to the putative HIF-1 site. Three AP-2 sites are present in the VEGF 5′-UTR and -flanking region (nucleotides 880, 890, and 1842, see Fig. 3), but only one of these is conserved in the human gene. In addition, a cluster of conserved SP1 sites is found in the minimal promoter (nucleotides 888-965, see Fig. 3) as defined by primer extension and transient expression assays (see below), while no TATA or CAAT box is found in either the rat or the human (35Tischer E.

The transcription initiation site was mapped by primer extension (Fig. 4A) and by the RNase protection assay (Fig. 4B) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Both analyses yielded similar results. The initiation site maps to the same region as described previously for the human gene (Fig. 3) and does not appear to change with hypoxia. While a single predominant transcription initiation site is evident using both methods, several other minor potential transcription initiation sites within 5-10 nucleotides of the most abundant start site were identified using the RNase protection assay. To locate the cis-regulatory sequences responsible for the transcriptional activation of VEGF, a series of constructs containing 5′-flanking sequences placed 5′ to the promoterless luciferase gene (pxp2) were transfected into PC12 cells by electroporation. Luciferase activity was assayed 13-15 h later. All constructs gave approximately 200-fold more light units in the luciferase assay than with the vector alone when transfected into PC12 cells and grown in 21% O2. Fig. 5A illustrates the fold of hypoxic induction of luciferase activity obtained from parallel tissue culture plates transfected with the different pxp2 constructs and cultured at 1% or 21% O2. No change was seen in the hypoxic induction of luciferase activity when 3′-flanking or 3′-untranslated region sequences were placed 5′ to the VEGF minimal promoter or 5′ to the thymidine kinase promoter (pT109luc) (data not shown). The most significant decrement in hypoxia-inducible luciferase activity occurred after deletion of a PvuII-SacI fragment (nucleotides 15-230, Fig. 3) from the 5′ end of the PvuII-PstI construct (Fig. 5A). The enhancer function of this fragment was confirmed by demonstrating that it could confer hypoxic responsiveness in either orientation when placed 5′ to a thymidine kinase luciferase construct (pT109luc or pT81luc) (Fig. 5B). Notably, this 215-bp fragment contained a region of highly conserved sequence between the rat and human genes (40/43 or 93%). Within this region of conserved sequence homology, a potential HIF-1 site was identified. Oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to this putative HIF-1 site (W28) as well as a 3-base pair substitution in the site (M28) that had previously been shown to eliminate HIF-1 activity (36Pugh C.W. Ebert B.L. Ebrahim O. Ratcliffe P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) both functionally in reporter assays and in EMSA assays.

https://openalex.org/W2017886031,"Early endosomes are cellular compartments receiving endocytosed material and sorting them for vesicular transport to late endosomes and lysosomes or for recycling to the plasma membrane. We have cloned a human cDNA encoding an evolutionarily conserved 180-kDa protein on early endosomes named EEA1 (Early Endosome Antigen1). EEA1 is associated with early endosomes since it co-localizes by immunofluorescence with the transferrin receptor and with Rab5 but not with Rab7. Immunoelectron microscopy shows that it is associated with tubulovesicular early endosomes containing internalized bovine serum albumin-gold. EEA1 is a hydrophilic peripheral membrane protein present in cytosol and membrane fractions. It partitions in the aqueous phase after Triton X-114 solubilization and is extracted from membranes by 0.3 M NaCl. It is a predominantly α-helical protein sharing 17-20% sequence identity with the myosins and contains a calmodulin-binding IQ motif. It is flanked by metal-binding, cysteine “finger” motifs. The COOH-terminal fingers, Cys-X2-Cys-X12-Cys-X2-Cys and Cys-X2-Cys-X16-Cys-X2-Cys, are present within a region that is strikingly homologous with Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAB1 protein required for endocytosis and with Caenorhabditis elegans ZK632. These fingers also show limited conservation with S. cerevisiae VAC1, Vps11, and Vps18p proteins implicated in vacuolar transport. We propose that EEA1 is required for vesicular transport of proteins through early endosomes and that its finger motifs are required for this activity.

INTRODUCTIONEndocytosis is a process whereby cells internalize extracellular molecules into cytoplasmic vesicles (Courtoy, 1991Courtoy P.J. Steer C.J. Hanover J.A. Intracellular Trafficking of Proteins. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1991: 102-156Google Scholar). In receptor-mediated endocytosis, ligands bind receptors on clathrin-coated pits, which invaginate forming coated vesicles; the vesicles uncoat and transport receptor-ligand complexes to early endosomes (Trowbridge et al., 1993Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Early endosomes are a major sorting compartment from which ligands may be released and transported to lysosomes and receptors recycled to the plasma membrane, or from which ligand-receptor complexes are transported to lysosomes, to the opposite side of polarized cells, or recycled to the plasma membrane (Shepherd, 1989Shepherd V.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 458-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ligands, dissociated by low endosomal pH, may be confined to the main body of endosomes and follow a nonselective default pathway to late endosomes and lysosomes (Mellman, 1993Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1993; 172: 39-45Google Scholar). Recycling receptors may escape the degradative pathway via tubular extensions and be sorted by specific interaction of their cytoplasmic tails with peripheral membrane proteins for targeting to distinct locations. Two models have been proposed for transport from early to late endosomes. The “vesicle shuttle model” proposes that early and late endosomes are preexisting compartments communicating via microtubule-dependent vesicular traffic (Griffiths and Gruenberg, 1991Griffiths G. Gruenberg J. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 5-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The “maturation model” suggests that early endosomes gradually “mature” into late endosomes and lysosomes (Murphy, 1991Murphy R.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1991; 1: 77-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Very little is known of proteins associated with early endosomes. The best characterized compartment-specific proteins are the small GTP-binding rab proteins with Rab5 localizing to early endosomes and Rab7 to late endosomes (Chavrier et al., 1990Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar; Gould, 1992Gould B. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization and cloning of human EEA1, a hydrophilic 180-kDa peripheral membrane protein on early endosomes. EEA1 shares 17-20% homology with the myosins and contains a calmodulin-binding IQ motif associated with these proteins. EEA1 is a predominantly α-helical protein flanked by NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal cysteine-rich, metal-binding “finger” motifs. The COOH-terminal finger motifs are highly conserved with a peptide encoded by the ZK632 cosmid from Caenorhabditis elegans and by the FAB1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The latter has been described as a gene required for the endocytic-vacuolar pathway and nuclear migration. Similar finger motifs, Cys-X2-Cys-X12-Cys-X4-Cys and Cys-X2-Cys-X13-Cys-X2-Cys-X4-Cys-X38-Cys-X2-Cys, are present, respectively, in S. cerevisiae VAC1 (Weisman and Wickner, 1992Weisman L.S. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 618-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Vps18p (Robinson et al., 1991Robinson J.S. Graham T.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 12: 5813-5824Crossref Google Scholar) proteins, both of which are required for vacuolar sorting. We propose that EEA1 has a role in early endosomal transport and that its conserved cysteine-rich, metal-binding fingers have a role in this process.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodiesThe autoimmune serum was from a patient with subacute cutaneous systemic lupus erythematosus identified in the Monash Clinical Immunology Laboratory. Rabbit antibody to EEA1 was raised against a bacterial fusion protein incorporating the carboxyl terminus of the protein (see below). Mouse anti-Rab5 monoclonal antibodies (Chavrier et al., 1990Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) and affinity-purified rabbit anti-Rab7 antibody were from Marino Zerial (EMBL).ImmunofluorescenceHeLa and 3T3 cells were fixed in 2-2.5% paraformaldehyde/PBS1( 1The abbreviations used are: PBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albuminPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisbpbase pair(s).) for 10-20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin (Sigma)/PBS for 10 min or 1% Nonidet P-40/PBS for 5 min. Fixed cells or Hep-2 cells (Kallestad), were reacted with the autoimmune serum diluted 1:200 in PBS, 0.5% saponin or with affinity-purified human or rabbit antibodies to EEA1. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS, 0.5% saponin and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-human Ig (Wellcome).Dual Immunofluorescence Confocal MicroscopyHeLa cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min; free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl/PBS; and cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS for 4 min. The cells were reacted with anti-transferrin receptor antibody (mouse monoclonal B3-25, Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) at 1:100 dilution and the affinity-purified human autoimmune serum. After three washes in PBS, anti-transferrin receptor was visualized with rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-mouse antibody (DiaNova, Germany) at a 1:100 dilution, and EEA1 was visualized with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-human Ig. Dual immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was also carried out with a Rab5-overexpressing HeLa clone, 2-1-6-1 (Stenmark et al., 1994aStenmark H. Valencia A. Martinez O. Ullrich O. Goud B. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Stenmark et al., 1994bStenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Cells were reacted with mouse anti-Rab5 monoclonal antibody (1:20 dilution in 5% bovine serum), affinity-purified rabbit anti-Rab7 antibody (1:8 dilution), or the affinity-purified autoimmune serum. The cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-human Ig, rhodamine-labeled donkey anti-mouse Ig (DiaNova), or anti-rabbit Ig (DiaNova).Immunoelectron MicroscopyEndocytic compartments of HeLa cells were labeled with endocytic tracers (5 nm of BSA-gold for the early endosomes and 16 nm of BSA-gold for late endosomes and lysosomes) as described previously (Chavrier et al., 1990Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) except that 5 nm of BSA-gold (A520 = 30) was internalized for 10 min at 37°C. The cells were then fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde in 250 mM HEPES (pH 7.35), processed for cryosectioning, and sectioned, and the thawed sections were labeled with affinity-purified anti-EEA1 antibody followed by protein A-gold (Chavrier et al., 1990Chavrier P.

Ultrastruct. Res. 1984; 89: 65-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). After embedding in methylcellulose/uranyl acetate, the sections were viewed at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV in a Zeiss transmission electron microscope.Subcellular FractionationHeLa or 3T3 cells were washed 3 times with PBS, detached with a rubber policeman, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer (0.01 M NaCl, 0.003 M MgCl2, 0.01 M Tris (pH 8.5) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM), leupeptin (0.5 μg/ml), pepstatin (1.0 μg/ml), and aprotinin (60 μg/ml)) on ice for 10 min. Cells were lysed with a 21-gauge needle and sequentially centrifuged at 600 × g to pellet nuclei, 10,000 × g to pellet mitochondria, and 100,000 × g to pellet membranes. The supernatant after the last centrifugation was kept as the cytosolic fraction. The pellets, resuspended in 50 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.6) containing 1 mM EDTA and the cytosolic fraction were stored at −70°C. Protein content of fractions was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce).ImmunoblottingSubcellular fractions of HeLa or 3T3 cells, aqueous and detergent phases of cells partitioned with Triton X-114 (Kooy et al., 1992Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), membrane fractions extracted with 0.3 M NaCl for 30 min on ice, and affinity-purified bacterial fusion protein were separated by 7.5 or 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with affinity-purified human and rabbit antibodies to EEA1 as described previously (Yeo et al., 1994Yeo J.P. Alderuccio F. Toh B.H. Nature. 1994; 386: 488-491Google Scholar). Immunoblots were also carried out with total HeLa cells and chicken fibroblasts under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Total HeLa cell lysates (100 μg) were processed for two-dimensional nonequilibrium pH gel electrophoresis/SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described (Mu et al., 1988Mu F-T Alderuccio F. Toh B.H. Gershwin M.E. Coppel R. Mackay I.R. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1988; 71: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar).Molecular Cloning5 × 105 plaque-forming units of λgt11 Hela cell cDNA expression library (Clontech) were screened with the autoimmune serum, diluted 1:1000 in PBS, 3% casein as described previously (Yeo et al., 1994Yeo J.P. Alderuccio F. Toh B.H. Nature. 1994; 386: 488-491Google Scholar). Positive plaques, identified with 125I-labeled protein A (2 × 105 cpm/ml), were purified by 3 cycles of immunoscreening. cDNA inserts were subcloned into pBluescribe (Stratagene), for double-stranded DNA sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination method. To obtain the full-length clone, a human hepatoma cDNA library (Stratagene) was screened with 32P-labeled DNA probes. Positive plaques were purified and plasmid rescued according to the manufacturer's instructions. Analyses were carried out using the MacVector program (International Biotechnologies, Inc.) or using software provided by the Australian National Genome Information Service. The cDNA sequence was compared with GenBank and EMBL data bases using the FASTA program (Lipman and Pearson, 1985Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2531) Google Scholar). The translated amino acid sequence was compared with the translated GenBank data base as well as with the Swiss-Prot protein data base. The Swiss-Prot data base was also searched using the pattern library search program of Smith and Smith, 1990Smith R.F. Smith T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar.Nucleotide Blot AnalysisFor DNA blots, human leucocyte genomic DNA (12 μg) was digested with restriction enzymes, subjected to electrophoresis in 0.6% agarose gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Filters were prehybridized for 4 h with 5 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5% skim milk, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 0.5% mg/ml herring sperm DNA; hybridized with 32P-labeled probe (specific activity >5 × 108 cpm/μg DNA) overnight at 65°C; washed with 1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65°C for 30-45 min; and autoradiographed. For RNA blots, total RNA isolated from HeLa cells was enriched for poly(A)+ RNA by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. Poly(A)+ RNA was fractionated on 1% agarose formaldehyde-denaturing gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with 32P-labeled DNA as described for DNA blots. Multiple tissue RNA blots (Clontech) were also probed.Production of Antibody to Recombinant Fusion ProteinpFM1, containing 900 bp of coding sequence encoding the carboxyl terminus of EEA1, was subcloned into pGEX 2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) vector. Escherichia coli were transformed with pGEX 2T or pGEX 2T containing pFM1 insert. The bacteria were induced to produce glutathione S-transferase or bacterial fusion protein with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (Kooy et al., 1992Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria were suspended in PBS, 1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g. Soluble glutathione S-transferase or fusion protein in the supernatant was purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography. Rabbits were immunized with 50 μg of purified fusion protein in Freund's complete adjuvent, boosted after 4 weeks with 50 μg of protein in incomplete adjuvent and bled after 2 weeks. Rabbit sera were tested by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting of 3T3 cells.Affinity Purification of Human and Rabbit Antibodies1 mg of purified glutathione S-transferase or bacterial fusion protein were bound to 1 ml of swollen CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia). Human autoimmune and rabbit immune sera were diluted 1:4 in PBS and recycled 3 times through the fusion protein column. In addition, the rabbit antibody was also recycled 3 times through a glutathione S-transferase column. The columns were washed extensively with PBS. The run-through from both columns was collected. Bound antibody, eluted with 3 M KSCN, was dialyzed against PBS and concentrated with a microconcentrator (Amicon).RESULTSEEA1 Co-localizes with Transferrin Receptor and with Rab5 but Not with Rab7The autoimmune serum reacted by immunofluorescence with multiple small vesicles distributed throughout the cytoplasm of human Hep-2 and HeLa cells, mouse 3T3 cells, and chicken fibroblasts (data not shown). These results and the immunoblotting data (see below) indicate that EEA1 is evolutionarily conserved. Affinity-purified human autoantibody to EEA1 and affinity-purified rabbit antibody to a bacterial fusion protein incorporating the carboxyl terminus of EEA1 gave the same immunofluorescence reactions (data not shown). Since the cytoplasmic vesicles reactive with the affinity-purified anti-EEA1 antibodies were reminiscent of endocytic structures, we carried out experiments to identify them using dual immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and endocytic markers. In HeLa cells, EEA1 co-localized extensively with the transferrin receptor (Fig. 1, A and A′), an established marker of early endosomes (Hopkins, 1983Hopkins C.R. Cell. 1983; 35: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar; Schmid et al., 1988Schmid S.L. Fuchs R. Male P. Mellman I. Cell. 1988; 52: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Since the image shown is a 0.5-μm optical section, plasma membrane-associated transferrin receptors were not readily detected. Localization of EEA1 to early endosomes was supported by co-localization with Rab5, a GTPase specifically localized to early endosomes (Chavrier et al., 1990Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), in HeLa cells moderately overexpressing Rab5 (Fig. 1, B and B′), and in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (not shown). In contrast, localization of EEA1 showed little overlap with that of Rab7 (Fig. 1, C and C′), a GTPase found on late endosomes (Chavrier et al., 1990Chavrier P. Parton R.G. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), indicating that EEA1 is not associated with the whole endocytic pathway.EEA1 Is Associated with Tubulovesicular Early Endosomes Containing Internalized BSA-GoldThe intracellular distribution of EEA1 was examined at the ultrastructural level by immunolabeling ultrathin sections of HeLa cells, which had internalized endocytic markers. Labeling for EEA1 was predominantly associated with tubulovesicular early endosomes containing BSA-gold internalized as a fluid phase marker for 10 min at 37°C (Fig. 2). Labeling was rarely associated with late endosomes, Golgi cisternae (results not shown), and the plasma membrane (for example, see Fig. 2A). In some cases, significant labeling was observed in close proximity to early endosomes but some distance away from the endosomal membrane (for example, see Fig. 2C). Whether this simply reflects labeling of the cytoplasmic surface of peripheral endosomal elements, which are not clearly visible in the plane of the section or of other endosome-associated material, is presently unclear.Fig. 2Immunoelectron microscopic localization of EEA1 in HeLa cells. HeLa cells were incubated with 5 nm of BSA-gold to label early endosomes and 16 nm of BSA-gold to label late endosomes and lysosomes (see “Materials and Methods”). After fixation, thawed cryosections were labeled with affinity-purified antibody to EEA1 followed by 10 nm of protein A-gold. PanelA shows a representative image of the cell periphery. Labeling for EEA1 (10 nm of gold, arrowheads) co-localizes with the internalized 5 nm BSA-gold (smallarrows). Note that there is negligible labeling for EEA1 in the cytoplasm and on mitochondria (m) and generally low labeling associated with the plasma membrane (pm). PanelsB and C show higher magnification views of early endosomes. The labeling for EEA1 (10 nm of gold) is associated with the tubulovesicular early endosomes (labeled with 5 nm of BSA-gold). In panelC, three of the gold particles (arrowheads) are clearly associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the early endosome. EEA1 labeling was rarely observed on late endosomes, labeled with 16 nm of gold (results not shown).

The 180-kDa protein was detected in membrane and cytosolic subcellular fractions of HeLa or 3T3 cells (Fig. 3), exclusively in the aqueous phase of cell extracts after Triton X-114 solubilization (Fig. 4) and was extracted from membranes by 0.3 M NaCl (data not shown). These observations suggest that EEA1 is a peripheral membrane protein. The results are consistent with the prediction that EEA1 is a hydrophilic protein lacking hydrophobic transmembrane domains (see below). Immunoblots with membrane fractions were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Fig. 3) as the signal developed by 4-choloro-1-napthol was very weak. These results suggest that either there is a larger pool of EEA1 in the cytosol than those associated with membranes or that EEA1 is easily dissociated from membranes during fractionation. Two-dimensional immunoblots showed that EEA1 has an acidic pI (data not shown), consistent with the predicted pI of the protein (see below).Fig. 3Immunoblotting of subcellular fractions of 3T3 cells with affinity-purified human or rabbit antibody to EEA1. Nuclear, mitochondria, and cytosol fractions (10 μg/lane), or membranes (50 μg/lane) were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with affinity-purified human (A) or rabbit (C) anti-EEA1 antibody or with normal human (B) or rabbit (D) serum. Bound antibody was detected with anti-human or anti-rabbit Ig and enhanced chemiluminescence for nuclear mitochondria, and membrane fractions or 4-choloro-1-napthol/H202 for cytosol fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Immunoblot of Triton X-114 fractions of 3T3 cells with affinity-purified anti-EEA1 antibodies. 3T3 cells were extracted with 0.5% Triton X-114.

Two positive clones (pFM5.5 and pFM3.5) were obtained after screening a human hepatoma λ zap cDNA library with 32P-labeled pFM1. A further clone (pFM9.9) was obtained from the same library after probing the library with a 500-bp HindIII fragment of pFM3.5. All four clones are probably derived from the same transcript since all overlapping regions had identical sequences. Four individual human genomic DNAs, digested with EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII and probed with 32P-labeled pFM1 gave a single fragment after EcoRI and BamHI digestion and two fragments after HindIII digestion (data not shown), consistent with an internal HindIII site in the cDNA. 32P-labeled pFM1 hybridizes with a 9-kilobase mRNA in a poly(A)+ RNA preparation from HeLa cells (data not shown). A similar sized message was found in a multiple tissue blot of skeletal muscle, heart, brain, lung, liver, and pancreas (data not shown). To exclude concatamer formation during library construction, pFM9.9, the cDNA clone containing the internal EcoRI site, was digested with EcoRI, and the fragment 5′ of this restriction enzyme site was hybridized to HeLa poly(A)+ RNA or to human multiple tissue blot. The same 9-kilobase message was obtained (data not shown), indicating that the 5′ fragment is a related fragment.Fig. 5Restriction map of full-length and partial length EEA1 cDNA clones.

https://openalex.org/W2043085507,"Aconitase is a member of a family of iron-sulfur-containing (de)hydratases whose activities are modulated in bacteria by superoxide radical (O)-mediated inactivation and iron-dependent reactivation. The inactivation-reactivation of aconitase(s) in cultured mammalian cells was explored since these reactions may impact important and diverse aconitase functions in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Conditions which increase O production including exposure to the redox-cycling agent phenazine methosulfate (PMS), inhibitors of mitochondrial ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, or hyperoxia inactivated aconitase in mammalian cells. Overproduction of mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase protected aconitase from inactivation by PMS or inhibitors of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, but not from normobaric hyperoxia. Aconitase activity was reactivated (t of 12 ± 3 min) upon removal of PMS. The iron chelator deferoxamine impaired reactivation and increased net inactivation of aconitase by O. The ability of ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase-generated O to inactivate aconitase in several cell types correlated with the fraction of the aconitase activity localized in mitochondria. Extracellular O generated with xanthine oxidase did not affect aconitase activity nor did exogenous superoxide dismutase decrease aconitase inactivation by PMS. The results demonstrate a dynamic and cyclical O-mediated inactivation and iron-dependent reactivation of the mammalian [4Fe-4S] aconitases under normal and stress conditions and provide further evidence for the membrane compartmentalization of O."

The present study examines the effects of physiological levels of GH administered to hypophysectomized rats on nuclear protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the liver. We report that intermittent plasma GH, but not continuous plasma GH, stimulates a high steady-state level of tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of a 93,000 dalton polypeptide, p93, which we identify as a novel DNA binding protein related to the prolactin-activable mammary gland factor Stat 5 (41Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 42Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). These findings are discussed in the context of the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which GH secretory patterns regulate the sexual dimorphism of liver gene expression. Adult male and female Fischer 344 rats (8-10 weeks of age) were untreated or were hypophysectomized by the supplier (Taconic, Inc., Germantown, NY), with follow-up care provided as previously described (43Waxman D.J. LeBlanc G.A. Morrissey J.J. Staunton J. Lapenson D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11396-11406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were maintained at the Laboratory for Animal Care Facility at Boston University (lights on 8 a.m.-8 p.m.) for at least three weeks following surgery to ensure completeness of hypophysectomy (absence of body weight gain). Intact, untreated male and female rats were killed between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m. Rat GH was administered to hypophysectomized rats by one of three protocols. Protocol A: intraperitoneal injection of GH was at 12.5 μg/100 g body weight, except where a lower dose (3 μg/100 g body weight) is specified. Rats were killed at time intervals ranging from 5 min to 4 h following a single intraperitoneal injection of GH, as specified in individual experiments. Where indicated, a second intraperitoneal injection of GH was administered 4 h after the first injection, and the animals were killed 45 min later. Protocol B: repeat subcutaneous injection of GH was at 12.5 μg/100 g body weight/injection, given at t = 0, 3, and 6 h to maintain a circulating level of GH over time, followed by sacrifice at t = 8 h. GH administered by the subcutaneous route produces periods of continuous circulating plasma hormone lasting 5-6 h (28Waxman D.J. Pampori N.A. Ram P.A. Agrawal A.K. Shapiro B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Isaksson O. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Protocol C: longer term continuous GH treatment was by hormone infusion at 2 μg/100 g body weight/h for 1, 3, or 7 days using an Alzet osmotic minipump (model 2001; Alza Corp., Palo Alto, CA). Minipumps were implanted subcutaneously on the backs of the animals under Ketamine anesthesia using protocols provided by the manufacturer and approved by the Boston University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Control animals received vehicle injections or vehicle-filled osmotic minipumps. These treatments correspond to biologically effective GH replacement doses, which mimic the intermittent plasma GH profile of male rats (periodic intraperitoneal GH injection) and the continuous plasma GH profile of females (repeat subcutaneous injection or GH infusion by osmotic minipump) (28Waxman D.J. Pampori N.A. Ram P.A. Agrawal A.K. Shapiro B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6868-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Rat GH used in these experiments was a hormonally pure grade obtained from the National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK (NIDDK-rGH-B-14-SIAFP, biopotency 1.8 I.U./mg). This material was prepared by subtractive immunoaffinity purification and was shown to be devoid of other pituitary hormones, including prolactin, TSH, FSH, and LH. Rat GH was dissolved in 30 mM NaHCO3, pH 10.3, containing 0.15 M NaCl, and the pH was immediately lowered to 9.5 by addition of 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.3. Rat albumin (Sigma) was added to 100 μg/ml to stabilize the hormone (27Pampori N.A. Agrawal A.K. Shapiro B.H. Acta Endocrinol. 1991; 124: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In other experiments, hypophysectomized rats were treated with human GH (NIDDK-hGH-B-1, BIO) or with rat prolactin (hormonally pure grade, NIDDK-rPRL-B-8-SIAFP) at 12.5 μg/100 g body weight, intraperitoneally, and the ani-mals were killed 45 min later. Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (serotype 026:B6; Sigma L-2762) was administered to hypophysectomized rats by intraperitoneal injection at 1 mg/150 g body weight to promote cytokine release (46Ruff-Jamison S. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Chen K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21933-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Animals were killed 75 min later. Nuclear extracts were prepared from individual, freshly excised rat livers using established methods (47Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), with the addition of the phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (10 mM) and sodium orthovanadate (1 mM) in the homogenization and nuclear lysis buffers and with the inclusion of the following protease inhibitors (Sigma) in the initial homogenization buffer: antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin (2 μg/ml each), aprotinin, leupeptin (5 μg/ml each), trypsin inhibitor (10 μg/ml), and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (0.1 mM). The final nuclear preparation was dialyzed against NED buffer [25 mM Hepes (pH 7.6 at 4°C), 40 mM KCl, 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol containing 0.5 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 10% glycerol] and then snap-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Cytosolic fractions were prepared by dilution of the supernatant obtained after the first centrifugation step (pelleting of nuclei through a 2 M sucrose cushion) with 2 volumes of NED buffer, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C to pellet a microsomal fraction. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were mouse monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse monoclonal antibody PY20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), and rabbit polyclonal Shafer anti-phosphotyrosine (11Campbell G.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22095-22101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the latter antibody was provided by Dr. L. Argetsinger (Univ. of Michigan). Monoclonal anti-Stat 1 antibody, raised to a peptide fragment comprised of Stat 1 amino acids 591-731 (S21120), monoclonal anti-Stat 3, raised to Stat 3 amino acids 1-178 (S21320), and two independent monoclonal anti-Stat 5 antibodies, both raised to amino acids 451-649 of sheep Stat 5 (S21520, lot 2 (clone 85) and lot 3 (clone 89)), were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Stat 1α and anti-Stat 3c were provided by Drs. Z. Zhong and J. Darnell (Rockefeller University) and were used for gel supershift experiments carried out as described (49Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J. Science. 1994; 264: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar). Anti-Stat 3c was raised against Stat 3 amino acids 688-727. Antiserum AbN, raised against amino acids 1-67 of mouse APRF (i.e. mouse Stat 3) (50Raz R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24391-24395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. D. Levy (New York University School of Medicine). Rat liver nuclear extracts (15 μg protein/lane) were electrophoresed through standard Laemmli sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (10%) gels, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and then probed with anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Stat antibodies. Nitrocellulose sheets were blocked for 1 h at 37°C with 4% non-fat dry milk (Blotto) (w/v) dissolved in 10 mM potassium Pi, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20 (anti-phosphotyrosine antibody) or with 3% bovine serum albumin dissolved in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (anti-Stat 5). In the case of the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody probings, a special grade of phosphotyrosine-free non-fat dry milk (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 17-1056) was used to block nonspecific binding sites. Nitrocellulose blots were washed and then probed for 1-2 h at 20-25°C with antibodies diluted 1/3000 in blocking solution. Detection was with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1/3000) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) imaging on x-ray film using ECL reagent (Amersham Corp.). Nuclear extract protein samples (25 μg) were incubated for 45 min at 37°C with protein phosphotyrosine phosphatase 1B (20 μl containing 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase-phosphatase 1B fusion protein conjugated to 10 μl of agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, 14-109)) in a total volume of 70 μl containing 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 50 μM CaCl2, and 25 μg of bovine serum albumin. Phosphatase was activated by preincubation for 15 min at 37°C as suggested by the supplier. Control samples included the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (0.1 mM). Phosphatase-treated samples were analyzed by phosphotyrosine Western blotting and by gel mobility shift assay using a rat β-casein promoter probe (see below). Rat liver nuclear extracts (50 μg) were incubated with 3 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 or 2 μl of anti-Stat 3 antibody AbN overnight at 4°C in IP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 containing 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) in a total volume of 100 μl. Protein A-Sepharose (25 μl of a 50% suspension) was added to each sample followed by incubation for 2 h at 4°C with gentle shaking. Samples were centrifuged for 4 min at 14,000 × g, and the Sepharose pellet was then washed three times with 500 μl of IP buffer. The washed beads were resuspended in 30 μl of of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer (3% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% glycerol, 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing pyronin Y dye), boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged for 4 min at 14,000 × g; the supernatant was then analyzed on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes, 32P-end labeled on one strand using T4 kinase, were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 5 μg of liver nuclear extract protein dissolved in 5 μl of NED buffer and 10 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 fmol of DNA probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 4% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaCl (15 μl, total volume). Samples were electrophoresed at room temperature through non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels (4% acrylamide, 0.05% bisacrylamide) in 0.5 × TBE buffer (44.5 mM Tris, 44.5 mM boric acid, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 2.5 h at 100 volts using standard methods. DNA probes used in these studies were as follows: (a) rat β-casein gene Stat 5/MGF response element, nucleotides −101 to −80 (51Wakao H. Schmitt-Ney M. Groner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16365-16370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 5′-GGACTTCTTGGAATTAAGGGA-3′ (sense strand, oligonucleotide ON-257) and 5′-gTCCCTTAATTCCAAGAAGTCC-3′ (antisense strand, ON-258) and (b)SIE probe, 5′-gtcgaCATTTCCCGTAAATCgtcga-3′ (sense strand, ON-242) and 5′-gacGATTTACGGGAAATGtcgac-3′ (antisense strand, ON-243) (52Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). Nucleotides used to facilitate T4 kinase 5′-labeling with [γ-32P]ATP or other purposes are shown in lower case. Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides used as competitors for the gel shift experiments were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and included SIE mutant oligonucleotide (mutation of TTCCCG to CCACCG; sc-2536), and GAS/ISRE consensus oligonucleotide (sc-2537). GH stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins in a reaction catalyzed by Jak2, a tyrosine kinase that is activated following GH binding to the GH receptor. Because many of the effects of GH on liver gene expression are sex dependent and are regulated by the temporal pattern of GH stimulation of hepatocytes, we examined whether there are any differences between male and female rats in their patterns of liver nuclear protein tyrosine phosphorylation. We examined nuclear proteins because the sex-dependent effects of GH on liver gene expression are manifest at the level of transcription initiation (37Sundseth S.S. Alberta J.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

Fig. 1A shows a Western blot of liver nuclear extracts prepared from adult male and adult female rat liver and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Several immunoreactive protein bands are common to both male and female nuclear extracts. In contrast, an anti-phosphotyrosine immunoreactive protein of ~93,000 daltons, designated p93, was prominent in male liver nuclear extracts but was present at low or undetectable levels in female liver nuclei. This same sex-dependent pattern of p93 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed using three distinct anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies: Shafer polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 1A) and monoclonal antibodies 4G10 (Fig. 2, see below) and PY20 (data not shown). Treatment of the liver nuclear extract with phosphotyrosine phosphatase resulted in a loss of the p93 band, confirming the phosphotyrosine nature of this protein (data not shown). p93 was not detectable with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody in nuclear-free liver cytosol, indicating that this tyrosine-phosphorylated protein is localized in the nucleus (see below).Fig. 2p93 is electrophoretically distinct from Stat 1 and Stat 3. Shown are Western blots of liver nuclear extracts probed with anti-Stat 3 (lane1), anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (lanes2-6), and anti-Stat 1 (lane7). The seven nuclear samples were electrophoresed on a single SDS gel, which was transferred to nitrocellulose and then cut into three strips (lanes1, 2-6, and 7) for parallel detection with the three indicated antibodies. The three strips were aligned prior to exposure to x-ray film for detection of the chemiluminescent signal by ECL. Liver nuclear extracts were prepared from individual male (M) (lanes2 and 7), female (F) (lane3), and hyp"

TIMP-2 stimulates the proliferation of fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) cells and normal dermal fibroblasts (Hs68) in a dose-dependent manner. This response is evident as early as 2 h and persists up to 48 h after treatment with recombinant TIMP-2 (rTIMP-2). The specificity of this response is demonstrated by the ability of affinity-purified polyclonal anti-TIMP-2 antibodies to ablate TIMP-2 mitogenesis and by the lack of response to TIMP-1. This response is also blocked by the presence of an adenylate cyclase inhibitor, 9-(tetrahydro-2-furyl)adenine (SQ22536). Although SQ22536 did not affect untreated fibroblasts or fibrosarcoma cells, this inhibitor completely abrogates the proliferative response induced by rTIMP-2. Treatment of these cells with rTIMP-2 also stimulates the production of cAMP in a time-dependent manner that differs for the two cell lines. Moreover, treatment of purified cell membranes with rTIMP-2 suppresses cholera toxin-mediated ADP-ribosylation of the GTP-binding protein, Gsα subunit. These results indicate that the αβγ heterotrimer is dissociated by treatment with rTIMP-2, which may facilitate the Gsα-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase and subsequent production of cAMP. Since cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and activates kinase activity, we evaluated how treatment with rTIMP-2 affected both these parameters. We demonstrate in this report that the cAMP produced in response to treatment with rTIMP-2 binds to the type I regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and stimulates kinase activity. These results are the first demonstration that TIMP-2 directly activates adenylate cyclase to pro-duce cAMP, which increases cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, resulting in stimulation of fibroblast mitogenesis.

Members of this protease family possess several conserved features including the consensus sequence for binding zinc at the active site and an activation locus responsible for the latency of the zymogen.

Recent studies have shown that SV40-transformed fibroblasts secrete TIMP-2 which is believed to mediate the survival of nontransformed fibroblasts in the absence of serum (12Nemeth J.A. Goolsby C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). TIMP-2 has also been shown to significantly increase the survival of pituitary folliculo-stellate cells cultured in the absence of serum (13Matsumoto H. Ishibashi Y. Ohtaki T. Hasegawa Y. Koyama C. Inoue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These growth-promoting effects are presumably mediated by specific TIMP binding sites on the cell membrane, i.e. putative TIMP receptors. Recent studies have demonstrated selective cell surface binding of TIMP-2 to HT-1080 cells that is not competed by TIMP-1 (11Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Ohuchi E. Shinagawa A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Emmert-Buck M. Emonard H.P. Corcoran M.L. Krutsch H. Foidart J.-M. Stetler-Stevenson W. FEBS Lett. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, neither the putative TIMP-1 or TIMP-2 receptor has been isolated or characterized. Furthermore, the signal transduction mechanisms involved in promoting growth by TIMPs have not been elucidated. Due to a growing body of evidence for the growth-promoting activities of the TIMPs, we have investigated the signal transduction mechanisms involved in TIMP-2-mediated growth stimulation of normal dermal fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells. We demonstrate that, in the absence of serum or exogenous growth factors, rTIMP-2 mediates a mitogenic response in normal dermal fibroblasts and fibrosarcoma cells by stimulating adenylate cyclase to produce cAMP which, in turn, activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). This is the first report demonstrating that TIMP-2 stimulates growth by activation of PKA. Fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080; ATCC CLL 121) and normal human newborn foreskin fibroblasts (Hs68; ATCC CRL 1635) were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) at passage 19 and 14, respectively. The HT-1080 cells obtained from ATCC are derived from a fibrosarcoma and have an epithelial-like morphology with a karyotype of 2n = 46. We used the HT-1080 cells between passages 19 and 30 and Hs68 cells between passage 14 and 20. Cells were grown to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 4500 mg/liter D-glucose, D-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin-G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), unless otherwise indicated. The rTIMP-2 protein was expressed using a vaccinia virus expression system and purified as described previously (15Fridman R. Fuerst T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D.

Bird (Oncologix, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Native TIMP-2 was purified from the human A2058 conditioned medium as described previously (3Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Krutzsch H.C. Liotta L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17374-17378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). rTIMP-1 was isolated from the conditioned medium of EPA-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (8/8 2G EPA2) (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) as described previously (16Welgus H.G. Jeffery J.J. Stricklin G.P. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11534-11539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then purified by HPLC gel permeation chromatography using 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. HT-1080 and Hs68 cells were plated at 5 × 103 cells/well of a 96-well Costar plate for 18 h in DMEM with 10% FBS. The cells were then starved 18 h in DMEM without serum. Fresh serum-free DMEM was added to the wells prior to treatment with TIMP-2. After the indicated period of incubation, [3H]thymidine (0.1 μCi/ml; Amersham Corp.) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The percent of thymidine incorporated in a 2-h pulse correlated in a linear fashion with the number of cells. The medium was subsequently discarded, the wells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the cells were fixed in methanol:glacial acetic acid (3:1). The incorporated [3H]thymidine was extracted as described previously and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting (17Murphy A.N. Unsworth E.J. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 157: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The mean and standard deviation of triplicate determinations were converted to percent control for graphic representation. SQ22536 or 9-(tetrahydro-2-furyl)adenine (Calbiochem/Novabiochem) was solubilized in sterile deionized water and added to cells at a final concentration of 0.1 μM(18Fabbri E. Brighenti L. Ottolenghi C. J. Enzym. Inhib. 1991; 5: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-TIMP-2 antibodies (5 μg/ml) were incubated with 24 nM rTIMP-2 for 1 h at 4°C and 1 h with anti-rabbit affinity gel (Oraganon Teknika, West Chester, PA). The supernatant from the immunoprecipitate was added to the cells followed by thymidine. Hs68 and HT-1080 cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well of a 25-cm2 Costar plate in 10% FBS for 18 h followed by an 18-h incubation in serum-free DMEM. After the indicated period of incubation at 37°C, the medium was discarded and the cells were washed once with PBS. The cAMP was extracted by adding to the cells 200 μl of Amersham's cAMP assay buffer containing 7% perchloric acid and 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma). After a 10-min incubation at 4°C, the cells were scraped, transferred to siliconized Eppendorf tubes (PGC Scientific, Gaithersburg, MD) and the precipitated protein pellet collected by a 10-min centrifugation in a refrigerated bench-top microcentrifuge. The supernatants were neutralized and the cAMP determined by 125I-cAMP radioimmunoassay (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein in the pellet was solubilized in 0.1 N sodium hydroxide, and the relative levels of protein were determined by the Bradford method (19Rosenberg N. Pines M. Sela I. FEBS Lett. 1982; 137: 105-107Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cAMP levels were normalized to the protein concentration and expressed as fmol of cAMP per μg of protein. HT-1080 cells were plated at 1 × 107 cells per 175-cm2 Nunc tissue culture flask and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 18 h followed by 18 h in serum-free DMEM. The cells were washed in PBS, scraped, and homogenized in 250 mM sucrose buffer containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm in a bench-top centrifuge, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was subjected to a 25-min high speed centrifugation (50,000 rpm) at 4°C (TL100 Beckman ultracentrifuge). The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of ribosylation buffer containing 100 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mM MgCl2, 100 μM GTP, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM thymidine, and protease inhibitors (same concentrations as above). rTIMP-2 (1 μg) was added to the membranes as indicated in the figure legends and incubated at 30°C for 30 s prior to the addition of 1 μg of activated cholera toxin (CT; List Biological Laboratories, CA) and 20 μCi of [32P]NAD (Dupont NEN; 2 mCi/ml). The reaction was then allowed to incubate for 20 min at 30°C. The radioactive membrane proteins were subsequently pelleted in a bench-top centrifuge, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in SDS-Laemmli sample buffer containing 1%β-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were heated in a boiling water bath for 2 min prior to loading and electrophoresis on a 10% Tris-glycine PAGE gel (Novex, San Diego, CA). Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane using 1× transfer buffer (Novex) containing 0.001% SDS. If CT was omitted from the reaction, the G-proteins were not labeled. The PVDF membrane was also assayed for Gsα protein immunoreactivity by Western blot. Nonspecific sites on the PVDF membrane were blocked using blocking buffer containing 0.9 M NaCl, 90 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.5), 1% non-fat dry milk, and 0.5% casein. The PVDF membrane was then incubated with anti-Gsα antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) followed by donkey anti-rabbit horse radish peroxidase antibody (Pierce), and the immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The extent of [32P]ADP-ribosylation was quantitated by autoradiography of the Western blot using an Arcus flatbed scanner (Agfa-Gevaert AG, Germany) and Image 1.49 program (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Hs68 and HT-1080 cells (1 × 107) were plated on 175-cm2 flasks in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 18 h followed by incubation in serum-free DMEM for 18 h. Prior to rTIMP-2 treatment, the cells were washed in serum-free DMEM. Cells were then incubated at 37°C with or without 48 nM rTIMP-2 (1 μg/ml) for 5 or 10 m. The cells were then washed in PBS, scraped, and homogenized in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and proteinase inhibitors (described above). 8-Azido-cAMP binding experiments utilized 2.5 μg of Hs68 and 4.5 μg of HT-1080 cell lysates. The cell lysates and 1 μg of the positive controls were incubated with 20 μM azido-[32P]cAMP (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA; 10 μCi/ml) for 30 min at 30°C. The positive controls used were bovine heart (contains 54- and 56-kDa type II regulatory subunits of PKA), and rabbit skeletal muscle (contains the 49-kDa type I regulatory subunit of PKA) (Sigma). Following incubation, the azido group was activated by a 30-s irradiation at 254 nm UV light (20Rohlff C. Clair T. Cho-Chung Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5774-5782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If the UV irradiation step is omitted, proteins were not labeled. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS-Laemmli sample buffer containing 1%β-mercaptoethanol and heated in a boiling water bath for 2 min prior to loading onto 8-16% Tris-glycine PAGE gel (Novex). After electrophoresis, the proteins were Western blotted onto PVDF membrane using 1 × transfer buffer containing 0.001% SDS. The 32P-labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography of the PVDF membrane and quantitated by densitometric analysis as described above. PKA activity was determined by using the PKA assay system from Life Technologies, Inc. with slight modification. Hs68 and HT-1080 cells (1 × 106) were plated on 75-cm2 flasks in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 18 h followed by 18 h in serum-free DMEM. After treatment with 24 or 48 nM rTIMP-2 for either 5 or 10 min, the cells were washed once with PBS, scraped, and homogenized in 500 μl of extraction buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and protease inhibitors (described above). The cell lysates (20 μl) from the samples were aliquoted in quadruplicate on a 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc, Denmark) and incubated for 10 min with either PKA inhibitor (PKI) or PKI plus cAMP (Life Technologies, Inc.). Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide; Life Technologies, Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP (20 μCi/ml; Amersham) were added to the reaction and incubated for 10 min at 30°C. Twenty μl from each reaction were spotted onto phosphocellulose disks and extracted with 1% phosphoric acid and water. The incorporated radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation. The percent active PKA is derived from the picomoles of phosphate incorporated into Kemptide per min as follows: (picomoles of phosphate/min inhibited by PKI in the absence of cAMP) divided by (picomoles of phosphate/min inhibited by PKI in the presence of cAMP) multiplied by 100 as per the manufacturer's instructions. Since TIMPs stimulate the growth of a variety of cells, we determined whether TIMP-2 was mitogenic to normal human foreskin fibroblasts (Hs68) and fibrosarcoma cells (HT-1080). Both cells respond to rTIMP-2 exposure with a dose dependent increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Two hours after exposure to rTIMP-2, the maximal stimulation in Hs68 cells is 2.5-fold over basal rate of thymidine incorporation and occurs at a narrow range of low nM concentration of TIMP-2 (24 nM or 500 ng/ml) (Fig. 1A, ■). TIMP-2 concentrations 2-fold greater than the maximally stimulating concentration also increases thymidine incorporation, but to a slightly lesser degree. Further increases in TIMP-2 concentrations above 48 nM markedly diminished the mitogenic response in Hs68 fibroblasts. Increasing concentrations of rTIMP-2 results in a dose dependent increase of thymidine incorporation in HT-1080 cells similar to Hs68 fibroblasts except that the maximal thymidine incorporation at 2 h was 1.5-fold over the basal level of incorporation (Fig. 1A, ●). Incubating HT-1080 cells with 24 nM rTIMP-2 and native TIMP-2 (data not shown) for 24 h also stimulates a 2.5-fold increase in mitogenesis (Fig. 1B). After a 48-h incubation with 48 nM rTIMP-2, a nearly 3-fold induction in thymidine incorporation is observed in these cells (Fig. 1A, ○). In Hs68 normal dermal fibroblasts, the response after a 2-h treatment with rTIMP-2 is much more dramatic compared to that of HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, but this difference is reduced by 24 h. These differences probably reflect the degree of synchronization induced by serum starvation, as well as inherent differences in the cell cycle times for these cell lines. The specificity of TIMP-2 inducing this proliferative response in HT-1080 (Fig. 1B) and Hs68 cells (data not shown) is demonstrated by the ability of affinity purified anti-TIMP-2 antibodies to ablate this response and inability of TIMP-1 to stimulate proliferation (Fig. 1B). Thus, the increase in thymidine incorporation mediated by TIMP-2 is evident as soon as 2 h after treatment and persists up to 24-48 h in HT-1080 cells. These results demonstrate that TIMP-2 specifically mediates a proliferative response that is not due to a contaminant in the TIMP-2 preparations utilized for these experiments. Previously, mitogenic responses have been observed by treating fibroblasts with agents that either increase intracellular cAMP (21Rozengurt E. Legg A. Strang G. Coutnay-Luck N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4392-4396Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Zurier R.B. Kozma M. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mitogenic response observed by treating fibroblasts with agents such as platelet-derived growth factor (24Rozengurt E. Stroobart P. Waterfield M.D. Deuel T.F. Keehan M.

Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar), or vasoactive intestinal peptide (22Zurier R.B. Kozma M. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 86: 251-258Google Scholar) has been attributed to an increased production of cAMP. In addition, reports have documented that ATP binds to the A2-adenosine receptor and stimulates proliferation in fibroblasts by increasing cAMP levels and PKA activity (29Huang N. Wang D. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86 (7908): 7909Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 30Wang D. Huang N. Heppel L.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 166: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Shi W. Bunney B. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2433-2438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The responses observed in both the HT-1080 and Hs-68 cell lines following TIMP-2 treatment are similar in magnitude to that observed if both cell lines are treated with agents that are known to increase or mimic endogenous cAMP, such as cholera toxin or low concentrations of dibutyryl cAMP. Hence, we evaluated whether exposure to rTIMP-2 may stimulate the production of cAMP. rTIMP-2 stimulates the production of cAMP in HT-1080 and Hs68 cell lines in a time-dependent manner. Treatment of HT-1080 cells with 48 nM rTIMP-2 stimulated an approximately 50-fold increase in the steady state levels of cAMP as early as 30 s compared to untreated cells (Fig. 2, ●). This rapid increase in the steady state levels of cAMP quickly decreases to normal levels by 10 min. The kinetics of cAMP production by Hs68 normal dermal fibroblasts in response to rTIMP-2 treatment is different from that observed with HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells. Addition of 48 nM rTIMP-2 stimulates the production of cAMP as early as 30 s after treatment (Fig. 2, ■). The levels of cAMP in Hs68 cells stimulated by a 2-min incubation with 48 nM rTIMP-2 are approximately 2.6-fold over basal cAMP levels. In these cells, the cAMP levels remain elevated up to 10 min after addition of rTIMP-2. Clearly, the production of cAMP in both cells is rapidly increased upon initial exposure to low nanomolar concentrations of rTIMP-2. However, the rate of cAMP breakdown following the initial stimulation differs dramatically between these cells, presumably due to differential regulation of phosphodiesterase activity. These kinetics may partially explain the differences in the time course of the proliferative responses of the two cell lines following rTIMP-2 treatment observed in our initial [3H]thymidine incorporation experiments (Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, these results clearly demonstrate that TIMP-2 stimulates the production of cAMP which may contribute to the mitogenic response in these cells. HPLC purified rTIMP-1 did not stimulate cAMP production when measured in HT-1080 cells consistent with the lack of growth stimulatory response in both cell lines to this inhibitor (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the increase in the steady state production of cAMP directly contributed to the TIMP-2 mitogenic responses, we evaluated whether blocking the production of cAMP with a specific adenylate cyclase inhibitor, SQ22536, affected the stimulation of proliferation by rTIMP-2. SQ22536 is a substituted adenine derivative that binds to the P-site of adenylate cyclase and suppresses prostaglandin-mediated proliferation. This analogue has been used in biological systems to demonstrate that prostaglandins and neurotransmitters (31Shi W. Bunney B. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2433-2438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Harris D.N. Asaad M.M. Phillips M.B. Goldenberg H.J. Antonaccio M.J. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 5: 125-134PubMed Google Scholar) stimulate adenylate cyclase activity. Treatment with SQ22536 (10−4 M) was not toxic to cells and did not affect basal levels of proliferation (Fig. 3). However, pretreatment of Hs68 (Fig. 3A) and HT-1080 (Fig. 3B) with SQ22536 prior to rTIMP-2 ablated the mitogenic response in both cell lines. These results demonstrate that stimulation of proliferation by TIMP-2 is directly dependent on activation of adenylate cyclase which increases the production of cAMP in these cells. Adenylate cyclase activity is stimulated by a receptor-mediated activation of the GTP-binding protein, Gsα (33Taussig R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). ADP-ribosylating toxins such as pertussis toxin (PT) and CT have been useful tools in determining the activation state of G-proteins, because it has been previously demonstrated that ADP-ribosylation of Gsα protein occurs only in the presence of the βγ subunit (34Graziano M.P. Freissmuth M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 264: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 35Toyoshige M. Okuya S. Rebois R.Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4865-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Previously, suppression of PT ADP-ribosylation has been employed to characterize the receptor and second messenger systems (24Rozengurt E. Stroobart P. Waterfield M.D. Deuel T.F. Keehan M. Cell. 1989; 34: 265-272Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (114) Google Scholar) stimulated by thrombin (36Brass L.F. Woolkalis M.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1986; 204: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and vasopressin. Because ADP-ribosylating toxins, such as CT and PT, more efficiently ADP-ribosylate the heterotrimeric αβγ complex, the inactivation state of the G-protein (38Manning D.R. Moss J. Vaughan M. ADP-Ribosylating Toxins and G-Proteins: Insights into Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1990: 349-370Google Scholar), we employed CT as a tool to evaluate whether treatment with rTIMP-2 affected the activation state of the Gsα protein. Membranes from HT-1080 cells were isolated and pretreated with rTIMP-2 prior to ADP-ribosylation with CT. The Gsα proteins in these cells were identified based on susceptibility to CT-mediated ADP-ribosylation, molecular weight, and immunoreactivity with specific Gsα antibodies. Although two molecular mass species (46- and 52-kDa) were identified by Gsα antibody staining (Fig. 4B), CT-mediated ADP-ribosylation favored the 46-kDa isoform (Fig. 4A). rTIMP-2 treatment (F"
https://openalex.org/W2056445524,"Activation of the cell surface receptors for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is effected by the aggregation of cytoplasmic domains that occurs when the extracellular domains of two or three receptors bind to trimeric TNFα or TNFβ. The structure of the type I TNF receptor extracellular domain (sTNF-R1), crystallized in the absence of TNF, has now been determined at 2.25-Å resolution. The receptor itself is an elongated molecule comprising four disulfide-rich domains in a nearly linear array. Contrary to expectations, the unliganded domains are found to associate into dimers of two distinct types, in which monomers are related by local two-fold axes of symmetry. In one case, the receptors are antiparallel to each other and associate through an interface that overlaps the TNF binding site. If intact receptors were capable of such an association, their cytoplasmic domains would be separated by over 100 Å. This interaction could inhibit signaling in the absence of TNF. Parallel dimers are also observed in which the dimer interface is well separated from the TNF binding site. Associations among TNF-bound parallel dimers could cause receptor clustering. Both dimers bury substantial areas of protein surface and are formed by polar and non-polar interactions.

Tumor necrosis factors (TNFα, TNFβ)( 1The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorsTNF-R1extracellular domain of the type I TNF receptor.) 1 are potent cytokines and immunomodulators that mediate many of the inflammatory and immune responses to infection and cancer (1Beutler B. The Tumor Necrosis Factors: The Molecules and Their Emerging Roles in Medicine. Raven Press, New York1992Google Scholar). Two cell surface receptors, type I (55 kDa) and type II (75 kDa), have been identified as transducers of TNF activity (2Brockhaus M. Schoenfeld H.-J. Schlaeger E.-J. Hunziker W. Lesslauer W. Loetscher H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3127-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). It is of crucial importance for cell viability that receptor signaling be tightly regulated and, in the absence of TNF, prevented. Excessive TNF-mediated receptor signaling may be responsible in part for the deleterious effects of diseases such as septic shock, malaria, and bacterial meningitis (1Beutler B. The Tumor Necrosis Factors: The Molecules and Their Emerging Roles in Medicine. Raven Press, New York1992Google Scholar, 3Balkwill F. Immunol.

Antibodies that recognize and cross-link the extracellular domain of the type I receptor elicit a signaling response (4Engelmann H. Holtmann H. Brakebusch C. Avni Y.S. Sarov I. Nophar Y. Hadas E. Leitner O. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, expression of a deletion mutant of the human TNF receptor that lacks most of the cytoplasmic domain results in the suppression of signaling (5Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4304-4307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These experiments provide strong evidence that signal transduction is triggered by TNF-mediated dimerization or trimerization of free monomeric receptors. The 2.9-Å resolution structure of the extracellular domain of the type I receptor (sTNF-R1) complexed with TNFβ is consistent with this hypothesis (6Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). However, it was recently shown that expression of a truncated form of the receptor lacking the extracellular and transmembrane domains also leads to signaling events that result in apoptosis (7Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These effects may be initiated by dimerization or multimerization of the cytoplasmic signaling domains (7Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J.

From these experiments, it might be surmised that under normal circumstances, the extracellular domains of the TNF receptor inhibit signaling in the absence of TNF. A possible inhibitory mechanism might involve the formation of specific contacts between the extracellular (ligand binding) domains of the receptor in the absence of ligand. Here, we report that in crystals, the soluble extracellular domain of the human type I TNF receptor forms two distinct types of dimeric structures. We suggest that intact receptors may form one or both types of dimer on the plasma membrane. These dimers could down-regulate signaling in the absence of TNF and, in one case, perhaps enhance TNF-induced receptor aggregation. The type I receptor for TNF (TNF-R1) is composed of an N-terminal extracellular ligand binding domain linked by a single transmembrane segment to a C-terminal cytoplasmic signaling domain (9Loetscher H.

The receptor belongs to the nerve growth factor receptor superfamily, which includes the type II TNF receptor, CD40, and the Fas antigen (11Bazan J.F. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 603-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Members of this family are characterized by extracellular domains that comprise repeats of a ~40-residue cystine-rich motif; TNF-R1 has four such repeats, each containing three internal disulfide bridges. The 161-residue extracellular domain of the type I TNF receptor (sTNF-R1) is found in serum and urine (12Engelmann H. Novick D. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1531-1536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where it may sequester free TNF, thus down-regulating TNF signaling. In the crystal structure of the sTNF-R1·TNFβ complex (6Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar), TNFβ binds three sTNF-R1 molecules, each at an intersubunit site on the trimeric cytokine. The second and third motifs (numbering from the N terminus) of the TNF-R1 extracellular domain form virtually all of the contacts with TNFβ. Presumably this complex brings the receptor intracellular domains together below the membrane in the correct steric manner for signal initiation. Human sTNF-R1, consisting of residues 11-172 of the type I receptor, was purified and crystallized as described previously (13Rodseth L.E. Brandhuber B. Devine T.Q. Eck M.J. Hale K. Naismith J. Sprang S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 332-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The crystal belongs to the tetragonal space group P41212 (cell dimensions a = 69 Å, c = 185.2 Å). Diffraction data measured in a nitrogen cryostream (95 K) at Station PX9.5 of the Daresbury Synchrotron (Table I) were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N.

The initial phases were calculated using MLPHARE (15Collaborative Computing Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Google Scholar) and refined and extended to 2.25 Å using SQUASH (16Zhang K.Y.J.

To aid in map interpretation, the phases from SQUASH were used to compute a sulfur anomalous difference Fourier map with native data (data set native2) measured at a wavelength of 1.54 Å. All other calculations were performed with the CCP4 program package (15Collaborative Computing Project, No. 4Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Google Scholar). Using the anomalous map to locate disulfide bonds, a model was built into the SQUASH (16Zhang K.Y.J. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. 1990; A46: 41-46Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 17Zhang K.Y.J.

The atomic model of the receptor from the coordinates of the sTNF-R1·TNFβ complex were not used to interpret the experimental electron density, nor was any phase information derived from that model. Fig. 1 shows the final 2Fo- Fc map and the anomalous map. The model was refined using X-PLOR using the stereochemical restraint set cof Engh and Huber (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR (Version 3.1) Manual. Yale University, New Haven1992Google Scholar). To follow the progress of refinement using the free R-factor as a criterion (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR (Version 3.1) Manual. Yale University, New Haven1992Google Scholar), 10% of the data (1904 of a total of 19,343 reflections), were randomly selected and excluded from further model building and refinement. Non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were used during the initial stages, but were released in the final cycles of refinement and model adjustment. Removal of the crystallographic restraints resulted in a reduction of the free R-factor. Ordered water molecules were included in the model if: 1) they corresponded to peaks with magnitudes greater than three standard deviations above mean absolute value (3σ) of the Fo- Fc difference Fourier map, 2) they formed potential hydrogen bond contacts with protein (or other water) molecules with reasonable stereochemistry, 3) they were visible in a 2Fo- Fc map at the 1.5σ level, and 4) their inclusion resulted in a reduction of the free R-factor. The model includes 2094 protein atoms and 260 solvent atoms, and is refined to a free R-factor of 24.9% and an R-factor of 19.3% for 19,343 reflections with F > 3σF in the resolution range 6-2.25 Å. The R-factor for all data (20,714 reflections) in this resolution range is 20.8%. The root mean square deviation from ideality of bond lengths is 0.009 Å, and from bond angles is 1.6°.

Using single isomorphous replacement/optimized anomalous scattering (SIROAS), we have determined the structure of non-glycosylated sTNF-R1 to 2.25 Å (Table I, Fig. 1). The unit cell contains two molecules of sTNF-R1 related by a non-crystallographic diad axis. The final refined model includes residues 12-150 of one monomer and residues 14-155 of the second. Thus, in both molecules, from 17 to 22 residues of the C termini are disordered and cannot be located in the electron density. The two molecules adopt similar conformations; superposition of corresponding Cα carbons results in a root mean square deviation of 1.03 Å. In contrast, individual motifs can superimposed with root mean square deviations ranging from 0.2 Å for Cα atoms in domain one to 0.4 Å for atoms in domain two, indicating segmental flexibility. The overall fold of the rod-shaped molecule is identical to that observed in the 2.85-Å crystal structure of sTNF-R1 complexed to TNFβ (6Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Operation of crystallographic symmetry elements upon the local two-fold axes generates two types of dimer in the unit cell as described below. Free sTNF-R1 is slightly more curved than in the complex with TNFβ. Pairwise superposition of corresponding motifs at α-carbon positions gives an average root mean square deviation of 0.65 Å; superposition of the entire molecule as a rigid unit gives a root mean square deviation of 1.70 Å. The greatest differences between the liganded and unliganded receptors appear in the structure of loop and turn regions. As in the complex, only half of the residues of the of the fourth motif are ordered. In crystals of unliganded receptor, the two independent molecules of sTNF-R1 are in extensive contact with each other, generating two distinct monomer-monomer interfaces. In contrast, apart from nonspecific crystal contacts, individual receptor extracellular domains do not contact each other in crystals of the sTNF-R1·TNFβ complex (6Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). We refer to the two dimeric species observed in crystals of unliganded sTNF-R1 as parallel and antiparallel. The antiparallel dimer is shown in Fig. 3A and is formed by a head to tail arrangement of the receptors. The second motifs of the two monomers are joined by a ladder of hydrogen bonds, forming a pseudo β-ribbon (Fig. 3B). The 1475 Å2 of protein solvent-accessible surface area (22Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5319) Google Scholar) buried by the antiparallel dimer formation (737 Å2/monomer) is comparable with that observed in stable dimeric protein associations (23Janin J. Miller S. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The interaction surface possesses the high degree of complementarity typical of protein antibody-antigen complexes (24Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar) and of the sTNF-R1·TNFβ complex itself (Table II). Antiparallel dimers are stabilized by an extensive network of van der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions (Table II). If such dimers were formed by intact receptors on the cell surface, the cytoplasmic domains of the two monomers would be separated in space by more than 100 Å (Fig. 3A). TNF would be expected to disrupt antiparallel dimers because the TNF binding surface completely overlaps the area of monomer-monomer contact.Table IIDimer interactionsTable IIDimer interactions Parallel dimers are formed by a head to head arrangement of the sTNF-R1 monomers (Fig. 4A). The subunit interface is formed almost entirely between the first motifs of the two molecules. The 2143 Å2 of total surface area withdrawn from solvent by dimer formation (1071 Å2/monomer) is comparable with that buried by the interaction of a single sTNF-R1 monomer with TNFβ in crystals of the complex. Like the antiparallel dimer, the parallel interface is characterized by a high degree of spatial complementarity and is stabilized by a large number of non-bonded interactions (Table II). The three glycosylation sites at Asn-25, Asn-116, and Asn-125 are remote from the interface and would seem unlikely to disrupt this, or the antiparallel dimer. Formation of parallel dimers by the intact receptors would place the cytoplasmic domains in close juxtaposition. A molecular docking experiment demonstrates that formation of parallel dimers would not interfere with TNF binding. Residues 64-116 (which contain the ligand binding surface) of the free and complexed sTNF-R1 can be superimposed at Cα positions with a root mean square deviation of 0.74 Å. The small increase in curvature of the free receptor in the dimerized state does not generate steric conflicts when docked into the TNF binding site. Thus, this dimer would seem likely to survive exposure to TNF. Comparison of the structure of the unliganded sTNF-R1 with that crystallized as a complex with TNFβ demonstrates that TNF binding does not induce global changes in the tertiary structure of the receptor. Instead, it appears that TNF binding may disrupt at least one type of TNF receptor dimer. We have described two types of TNF-receptor dimer that appear in crystals of unliganded sTNF-R1; in each of these, monomers associate at interfaces that are comparable in area and composition to other protein-protein complexes. It is therefore possible that such dimers could form between holoreceptors at the membrane surface. Although dimerization of TNF-receptor extracellular domains has not, to our knowledge, been observed in dilute solution, the limited solubility of sTNF-R1 (2-3 mg/ml in PBS buffer at pH 8.0)( 2T. Q. Devine, unpublished data.) 2 indicates that it easily forms aggregates. In vivo, the receptors are restricted to the two-dimensional surface of the membrane in which self-association is entropically more favored. The induction of apoptosis in the absence of TNF by expression of the TNF-R1 cytoplasmic domain suggests that the extracellular domain of the receptor is not required to initiate signaling and that self-association of cytoplasmic domains can occur in its absence (7Boldin M.P. Mett I.L. Varfolomeev E.E. Chumakov I. Shemer-Avni Y. Camonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 387-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Rather, the extracellular domain of the type I receptor may enforce a non-signaling state, possibly by inhibiting productive self association of intracellular domains. In accordance with the crystal structure, an antiparallel association between the second disulfide-rich motifs of two receptors would cause their signaling domains to be separated by more than 100 Å. It is possible that an interaction of this type has steric consequences as well, so as to prevent productive contacts between cytoplasmic domains in different receptor dimers. The immediate effects of TNF binding would be, first, to disrupt inhibitory interactions between receptors, and second, to promote productive interactions between cytoplasmic domains. The mechanism of receptor-mediated signal inhibition proposed here requires a specific set of interactions that would not, in general, be mimicked by the extracellular domains of other receptors. Accordingly, Bazzoni et al.(25Bazzoni F. Alejos E. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) found that chimeric receptors, containing the extracellular domain of erythropoietin receptor fused to the TNF-R1 cytoplasmic domain, are cytotoxic even in the absence of erythropoietin. Unlike antiparallel dimers, parallel TNF-R1 dimers might form in the presence of TNF, because the self-association and TNF-binding surfaces are located on opposite sides of the receptor extracellular domain. For the same reason, both interactions might occur simultaneously, thus generating an aggregate of TNF-R1·TNF complexes on the cell surface (Fig. 4B). Such an array would increase the local concentration of TNF signaling complexes at the cell surface (26Bajzer Z. Myers A.C. Vuk-Pavlovic S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13623-13631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and could also play a role in receptor internalization. Favorable interactions between cytoplasmic domains (9Loetscher H. Pan Y.-C.E. Lahm H.-W. Gentz R. Brockhaus M. Tabuchi H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1990; 61: 351-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) would enhance the stability of parallel dimers. Since it is difficult to assess the specific binding energies associated with interacting protein-protein surfaces, it is not possible to predict whether parallel or antiparallel dimers (if either) would predominate at the plasma membrane in the absence of TNF. Neither are we able to formulate a simple mechanism by which parallel dimer formation, in the absence of TNF, would down-regulate signaling through the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor. We have presented evidence that the type I TNF receptor dimerizes in the absence of TNF, and might do so in in its presence, through interactions between the receptor extracellular domains. Whether or not such effects will be found in vivo and whether they occur generally among the NGF class of receptors remains to be determined.

We have now identified the point in the endocytic pathway at which PI 3-kinase binding sites are required. Receptor internalization from the plasma membrane, measured as the acquisition of acid resistance of prebound 125I-PDGF, was only slightly decreased in cells expressing a PDGF receptor mutant (F5) lacking PI 3-kinase, GTPase-activating protein (GAP), phospholipase Cγ, and Syp binding sites but not expressing mutants where any of these individual sites were restored nor expressing a mutant lacking exclusively PI 3-kinase binding sites. In contrast, the extent of down-regulation of PDGF binding sites from the cell surface after prolonged incubation with PDGF as well as the degradation of [35S]methionine-labeled receptor were markedly reduced in cells expressing the F5 mutant, mutants restored in GAP, phospholipase Cγ, or Syp binding sites or expressing the mutant exclusively lacking PI 3-kinase binding sites but not in cells expressing the mutant where PI 3-kinase binding sites were restored. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity with wortmannin caused a dramatic decrease in the rates of down-regulation and degradation of wild-type receptors. These results suggest that PI 3-kinase binding sites are not required for internalization of PDGF receptor but are required to divert the PDGF receptor to a degradative pathway. Furthermore, the requirement for PI 3-kinase binding sites on the receptor appears to be due to a requirement for PI 3-kinase catalytic activity.

Stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases rapidly elicits a large number of intracellular events including actin filament reorganization, membrane ruffling, transmembrane ion fluxes, and changes in the activity of metabolic enzymes. One of the earliest responses to stimulation is the internalization of the activated receptor. Internalized receptors can recycle back to the cell surface (1Marshall S. Green A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11464-11470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or can be sorted to the lysosome for degradation. This latter process results in the down-regulation of cell surface receptors. Receptor down-regulation appears to be an important element in the control of cellular proliferation, since mutations that impair the ability of some receptors to internalize and degrade cause cell transformation (2Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Lund K.A. Welsh J.B. Chang C.P. Walton G.M. Der C.J. Wiley H.S. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1989; 59: 33-43Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition to its physiological relevance, the down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases offers a useful model system to study the molecular events involved in the trafficking of proteins from the plasma membrane to the lysosome, because receptor movement can be selectively and synchronously elicited by addition of specific growth factors (24Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panatoyou G. Ruiz-Larrea F. Thompson A. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1992; 70: 419-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Internalization of receptor tyrosine kinases often involves both high affinity, low capacity and low affinity, high capacity pathways. The high affinity, low capacity internalization depends on tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor cytoplasmic domain (3Backer J.M. Khan C.R. Cahill D.A. Ullrich A. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16450-16454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 5Felder S. LaVin J.

The molecular requirements involved in this sorting process are not understood. We have recently explored the hypothesis that the SH2 domain-containing proteins that are recruited to receptor cytoplasmic domains after activation may play a role in the trafficking of receptor tyrosine kinases (8Kapeller R.

A PDGF receptor mutant that can autophosphorylate but lacks the major high affinity binding sites for PI 3-kinase, GAP, phospholipase Cγ, and Syp displays striking alterations in cellular trafficking patterns (9Joly M.

Restoration of the PI 3-kinase binding sites completely restores the ability of receptors to concentrate intracellularly. platelet-derived growth factor GTPase-activating protein phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium epidermal growth factor. These results raise important questions regarding the point in the endocytic pathway at which PI 3-kinase binding sites are required and the biochemical basis for this requirement. The results shown here strongly suggest that PI 3-kinase binding sites are required at a postendocytic step, where the sorting of activated PDGF receptors to the lysosome occurs. Furthermore, wortmannin, which has recently been shown to be a potent (IC50 < 10 nM) inhibitor of the p110 catalytic subunit of mammalian PI 3-kinase (18Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits the down-regulation and degradation of activated receptor, suggesting that the requirement for PI 3-kinase binding sites reflects a requirement for PI 3-kinase catalytic activity. The F52( 2The mutants used in this study are designated in the following way. The receptor in which tyrosines at positions 740, 751, 771, 1009, and 1021 were replaced by phenylalanine is called F5. The “add-back” mutants represent F5 receptors in which phenylalanines at positions 740, 751, 771, 1009, or 1021 were replaced by tyrosine individually or in combination and are designated by the single letter code for tyrosine, followed by the position number of the replaced residue. The add-back mutant in which phenylalanines at positions 740 and 751 were replaced by tyrosine is called Y40/51. The wild-type receptor in which tyrosines at positions 740 and 751 were replaced by phenylalanine is called F40/51.) mutant is a receptor in which tyrosines 740, 751, 771, 1009, and 1021 were substituted with phenylalanine and is deficient in the binding of PI 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ, GAP and Syp (17Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Receptor constructs selectively restored in the high affinity binding of PI 3-kinase (Y40/51), phospholipase Cγ (Y1021), GAP (Y771), or Syp (Y1009) were generated by mutating the corresponding phenylalanines in F5 back to tyrosine. In addition, a receptor exclusively deficient in PI 3-kinase binding (F40/51) was constructed by mutating Tyr740 and Tyr751 in the wild-type receptor to phenylalanine. Each construct was introduced into human HepG2 cells, which do not express endogenous β-PDGF receptors, with the pLXSN retroviral expression vector (17Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). All constructs were expressed at approximately 5 × 105 receptors/cell (17Valius M. Kazlauskas A.

Cells were grown to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%) (UBI) containing G418 (0.5 mg/ml). Recombinant PDGF-BB was labeled with 125I to 21,000 cpm/ng by the method of Bolton and Hunter according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). Cells expressing wild-type or mutant PDGF receptors or the empty pLXSN vector were grown in 12-well multiwell dishes to 75% confluence and serum-starved for 18 h. PDGF internalization experiments were conducted as described by Mori et al.(20Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21158-21164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold DMEM and incubated with 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 50,000 cpm of 125I-PDGF. After 90 min of incubation at 5°C, monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold binding medium. Binding medium at 37°C was then added for 0-20 min, and cells were rapidly cooled by placing the multiwell dishes on ice and washing with ice-cold binding medium. Cells were then incubated for 5 min with 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5, or with the same buffer at pH 3.5. This acid wash procedure has been shown to release approximately 90% of cell surface bound radioactivity (20Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21158-21164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then washed three times with binding medium, and monolayers were dissolved in a lysis buffer composed of Triton X-100 (1%), glycerol (10%), and Tris, pH 7.5 (20 mM). Radioactivity associated with the acid-washed monolayers (internalized) or the non-acid washed monolayers (total cell-associated) was measured by γ counting. Cells expressing wild-type or mutant PDGF receptors or the empty pLXSN vector were cultured and serum-starved as described above. Monolayers were incubated with DMEM or DMEM containing 0-20 ng/ml PDGF-BB for 30-90 min at 37°C. Cells were then cooled and acid-washed as described above. After the acid wash, cells were washed three times with ice-cold DMEM and incubated for 90 min at 5°C with 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 100,000 cpm of 125I-PDGF. Monolayers were washed three times and dissolved in lysis buffer. Nonspecific binding was defined as the radioactivity bound to monolayers of HepG2 cells transfected with pLXSN empty vector. Cells were grown to 85% confluence in 60-mm culture dishes and incubated for 18 h in serum-free, methionine-free DMEM containing [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) (Amersham Corp.) and bovine serum albumin (1%) and then for 45 min in DMEM containing bovine serum albumin (1%) and methionine (0.3 mg/ml) (DMEM-bovine serum albumin). Cells were then incubated without or with PDGF-BB (50 ng/ml) (UBI) for 2 h. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 800 μl of a buffer containing 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, 1 mM 1,10 phenanthroline, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM sodium vanadate (Sigma). Receptors were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody to α- and β-PDGF receptors (UBI), resolved on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to autoradiographic film for 48 h. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (UBI) was used for immunoblotting. Wortmannin (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO to a final concentration of 10 mM, dispensed into 5-μl aliquots, and stored at −80°C. Wortmannin aliquots were thawed and diluted 1:1000 in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and aliquots from this diluted stock were added directly to the cells to achieve the final concentrations indicated in each experiment. Because wortmannin is photosensitive and unstable in aqueous solutions, it was routinely thawed, diluted, and added to cells within 10 min. Thawed aliquots were discarded. Several trafficking and sorting steps are involved in targeting activated PDGF receptors into the lysosome. Receptors must first clear the plasma membrane by a ligand-dependent process that involves clustering in clathrin-coated pits, invagination, and scission of clathrin-coated vesicles (21Lamaze C. Baba T. Redelmeir T.E. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Subsequently, receptors are sorted to a nonrecycling, degradative pathway. The observed peripheral distribution of receptor mutants lacking PI 3-kinase binding sites (9Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 581-724Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar) could result from a defect either in clearing the plasma membrane or in leaving the early endosomal/recycling pathway. We performed experiments to evaluate the ability of wild-type and mutant receptors to undergo the initial steps of internalization. Cells were incubated with tracer concentrations (2 ng/ml) of 125I-labeled PDGF for 60 min at 4°C. Unbound ligand was washed, and cells were placed at 37°C for 0-10 min. At specific time points, cells were returned to 4°C, and the ligand remaining accessible to the extracellular space was removed by acid washing (20Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21158-21164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Uptake was only observed in cells expressing PDGF receptors and not in cells transfected with empty pLXSN vector, demonstrating the specificity of the assay (Fig. 1). In further experiments internalization was measured after 10 min of incubation. Approximately 60% of the PDGF initially bound to the cell surface (determined in cells that were not acid washed) became resistant to acid washing after 10 min of incubation (Fig. 2). Thus, the initial uptake of PDGF receptor in these cells was rapid and comparable with that observed by other investigators using other cell lines (20Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21158-21164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial uptake of the F5 mutant was slightly but significantly decreased compared with that of the wild-type receptor. Add-back mutants, as well as a mutant lacking only PI 3-kinase binding sites (F40/51), internalized PDGF like the wild-type receptor. These results suggest that the initial steps of PDGF receptor internalization are independent of PI 3-kinase, GAP, Syp, or phospholipase Cγ. The results also indicate that the large differences in the distribution of PDGF mutant receptors in the cell, observed by immunofluorescence (9Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 581-724Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar), are not due to differences in the ability of receptors to undergo the initial steps of internalization (Fig. 2). Previous studies have shown that prolonged exposure of cells to PDGF leads to a rapid disappearance of PDGF receptors from the plasma membrane and to their subsequent degradation (4Lohse M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). This down-regulation of PDGF receptors occurs rapidly, indicating that once internalized, receptors must move from the early endosomal/recycling pathway to the lysosomal pathway. The peripheral distribution of receptor mutants lacking PI 3-kinase binding sites could be due to an impairment in the ability of receptors to progress beyond the early endosomal/recycling pathway. To explore this possibility, we analyzed the extent to which PDGF receptor mutants down-regulate from the plasma membrane. Cells expressing the indicated constructs were incubated with unlabeled PDGF for 60 min at 37°C and subsequently placed at 4°C. Unlabeled PDGF was removed by a brief acid wash, and the remaining PDGF binding sites on the cell surface were then measured with 125I-PDGF. Approximately 70% of the total cell surface binding sites for PDGF disappeared after exposure of cells expressing wild-type receptors to 20 ng/ml of PDGF for 60 min (Fig. 3). In contrast, only 20% of the binding sites disappeared after a similar incubation of cells expressing the F5 mutant or a receptor lacking only sites 740 and 751 (F40/51). Only the add-back mutant restored in PI 3-kinase binding sites (Y40/51) down-regulated to an extent similar to that of the wild-type receptor. Thus, the ability of receptors to efficiently down-regulate from the plasma membrane and to concentrate in juxtanuclear structures depended on the presence of functional PI 3-kinase binding sites. Because the lack of PI 3-kinase binding sites does not impair the initial internalization of receptors from the plasma membrane (Fig. 2), the observed lack of efficient down-regulation is probably due to recycling of internalized receptors to the cell surface. Thus, lack of PI 3-kinase binding sites on the PDGF receptor results in its failure to progress from early and/or recycling endosomes to later steps in the endocytic pathway. The results presented above suggest that efficient down-regulation of PDGF receptors from the cell surface requires intact PI 3-kinase binding sites. A prediction made by this hypothesis is that receptors that fail to down-regulate could undergo several rounds of ligand binding and activation, and this event would be reflected by the tyrosine phosphorylation state of the receptor. To test this prediction, we analyzed the tyrosine phosphorylation state of PDGF receptor mutants by immunoblotting of receptor immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 4). Tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type and all mutant receptors could be detected within 5 min of exposure of cells to 50 ng/ml PDGF. The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation on the mutant receptors was significantly lower than for the wild type after 5 min of stimulation (Fig. 4, left and middlepanels). This decrease may be due to the absence in the mutants of three to five major autophosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation sites remaining on the mutant receptors probably include Tyr857, a major phosphorylation site involved in activation of the receptor kinase, as well as residues in the juxtamembrane region of the receptor (22Kazlauskas A. Durden D.L. Cooper J.A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). More importantly, striking differences were observed in the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant receptors. The phosphorylation of receptors containing PI 3-kinase binding sites reached maximal levels after 5-10 min of incubation and then declined. Virtually no phosphotyrosine was detected in these receptors after 120 min of stimulation. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of the F5 mutant and of the add-back mutants containing phospholipase Cγ, GAP, or Syp binding sites, increased steadily during the first 60 min of incubation. A substantial amount of phosphotyrosine (50% of maximal value) could still be detected after 2 h of incubation with ligand (Fig. 4, left and rightpanels). The persistence of tyrosine phosphorylation on receptors lacking PI 3-kinase binding sites is consistent with the possibility that these receptors undergo additional rounds of ligand binding and activation as a consequence of recycling to the cell surface. The results shown above indicate that a lack of PI 3-kinase binding sites on the PDGF receptor results in its failure to progress from early and/or recycling endosomes to later steps in the endocytic pathway leading to the lysosome. To directly determine the rates of ligand-induced receptor degradation, cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and then incubated for 2 h in the absence or presence of 50 ng/ml PDGF. PDGF receptors were then immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody raised against the receptor cytoplasmic domain. Receptors were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. A pronounced decrease in the levels of labeled wild-type and Y40/51 receptors was observed in these experiments (Fig. 5). In contrast, neither F5 mutant receptors nor the other add-back mutant receptors were appreciably degraded after a similar time of exposure to ligand. These results support the hypothesis that intact PI 3-kinase binding sites are required for the trafficking of activated PDGF receptors to the lysosomal pathway. Receptors that rapidly concentrate in juxtanuclear vesicular structures (9Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 581-724Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar) after exposure to PDGF are efficiently degraded, consistent with these structures corresponding to late endosomes, multivesicular bodies, and lysosomes. The results shown above indicate a requirement for PI 3-kinase binding sites for receptor trafficking into the lysosomal pathway. However, these results do not prove that PI 3-kinase is required for this trafficking process, because the same phosphotyrosine residues that bind PI 3-kinase could conceivably also interact with other cellular components. For example, Tyr751 has been shown to be a binding site for the adaptor protein Nck (16Nishimura R. Li W. Mondino A. Zhou M. Cooper J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6889-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To explore the specific role of PI 3-kinase, we used a fungal toxin, wortmannin, which has recently been shown to be a potent inhibitor of the catalytic p110 subunit of mammalian PI 3-kinase (18Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Okada T. Kawano Y. Sakakibara T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first analyzed the effects of wortmannin on receptor down-regulation from the cell surface (Fig. 6). Cells expressing wild-type receptors, the F5 mutant, and the Y40/51 add-back mutant were incubated without or with wortmannin (50 nM) for 10 min and then exposed to PDGF (50 ng/ml) for 30-90 min at 37°C. After a brief acid wash, the binding of 125I-PDGF to the cell surface was measured. As shown above, incubation of cells for 60-90 min with PDGF resulted in the efficient down-regulation of wild-type and Y40/51 receptors but not of the F5 mutant receptor. In contrast, when cells were treated with wortmannin, PDGF-induced down-regulation of wild-type and Y40/51 receptors was impaired and was now indistinguishable from that of the F5 receptor (Fig. 6). Thus, the ability of receptors that bind PI 3-kinase to efficiently down-regulate from the plasma membrane is abolished by wortmannin treatment. Cells expressing wild-type PDGF receptors were incubated with [35S]methionine, chased for 45 min with unlabeled methionine, and then incubated for 2 h in the absence or presence of PDGF. Wortmannin, where indicated, was added to the cells for the last 10 min of the chase period and remained in the medium for the duration of the experiment. PDGF receptors were immunoprecipitated, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 7). Treatment of cells with PDGF resulted in an almost complete degradation of labeled receptor. Wortmannin fully inhibited receptor degradation in response to PDGF but did not significantly alter the levels of labeled receptor immunoprecipitated from cells incubated in the absence of PDGF (Fig. 7, leftpanel). The maximal inhibitory effect was observed between 10 and 25 nM wortmannin (Fig. 7, rightpanel), which is similar to the dose required to fully inhibit PI 3-kinase invitro(17Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 18Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At these concentrations, the tyrosine kinase activity of the PDGF receptor was unaffected (not shown). Thus, the down-regulation and degradation of PDGF receptors in human HepG2 cells is fully blocked in response to concentrations of wortmannin that inhibit PI 3-kinase. These results support the hypothesis that the requirement for PI 3-kinase binding sites for PDGF receptor trafficking into the lysosomal pathway is due to a requirement for PI 3-kinase activity. We have previously reported that the trafficking of PDGF receptors requires PI 3-kinase binding sites (9Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 581-724Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A critical question raised by this finding is at what point in the pathway of PDGF receptor internalization are these sites required. Here we show that the requirement for PI 3-kinase binding sites is not during the initial steps of endocytosis. These results are consistent with the findings of Mori et al.(25Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4917-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who have shown that only mutations in tyrosine 579 of the PDGF receptor cytoplasmic domain significantly affect this process. The initial internalization of a receptor mutant lacking tyrosines 740, 751, 771, 1009, and 1021 was decreased by 30%, but restoration of any of the missing tyrosine residues was sufficient to restore the wild-type internalization rates. These results indicate that these residues play a small individual role in the internalization of the PDGF receptor. However, the results also suggest that multiple tyrosine residues in the receptor cytoplasmic domain can function as weak internalization signals. The net rate of internalization is probably the product of all these signals. PI 3-kinase binding sites appear to be necessary at a step subsequent to internalization. Without PI 3-kinase binding sites receptors escape degradation and appear to recycle to the cell surface. A second question addressed in this study relates to the nature of the requirement for PI 3-kinase binding sites. These sites are known to bind the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase but also the adaptor protein Nck (16Nishimura R. Li W. Mondino A. Zhou M. Cooper J. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6889-6896Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and possibly other unknown factors. The p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase interacts with dynamin, a GTPase that is critically required for endocytosis. Thus, the requirement for PI 3-kinase binding sites for PDGF receptor trafficking could reflect a requirement for p85, for p110 catalytic activity, for Nck, or for a yet unknown factor. The finding that wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of PI 3-kinase activity, blocks efficient down-regulation and degradation of wild-type receptors suggests strongly that the requirement for PI 3-kinase binding sites reflects a requirement for PI 3-kinase activity. A role for PI 3-kinase activity in sorting of membrane proteins has been clearly established in yeast, where the only known PI 3-kinase, vps34, is required for the sorting of newly synthesized hydrolases to the yeast vacuole (26Herman P.K. Stack J.H. Emr S.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 363-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, vps34 has also been recently discovered in a screen for endocytosis-dependent growth, which monitors endocytosis from the cell surface to the vacuole (27Munn A.L. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Experiments on these mutants have shown that vps34/end12 is not necessary for internalization of α-factor but is critically required for its subsequent delivery into the vacuole and its degradation (27Munn A.L. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with a direct role for PI 3-kinase in sorting in the endocytic pathway both in yeast and mammalian cells. A requirement for PI 3-kinase in steps subsequent to initial internalization suggests that postendocytic receptor sorting requires active receptor tyrosine kinase activity in order to maintain an association with the SH2 domains of p85. It has been shown that the internalized EGF and PDGF receptors have an active tyrosine kinase activity (8Kapeller R. Chakrabarti R. Cantley L. Fay F. Corvera S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6052-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Honegger A.M. Dull T.J. Felder S. VanOberghen E. Bellot F. Szapary D. Schmidt A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1987; 51: 199-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and that the activity of the EGF receptor kinase is necessary for sorting the EGF receptor to the lysosome (29Futter C.E. Felder S. Sclessinger J. Ullrich A. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This view, however, has been questioned recently in experiments that conclude that postendocytic trafficking of EGF receptors is independent of their intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. In this latter paper however, degradation of EGF ligand, not of EGF receptor, was analyzed (30Herbst J.J. Opresko L.K. Walsh B. Lauffenburger D.A Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12865-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An important question raised by these results is whether PI 3-kinase binding is required for the down-regulation of other receptor tyrosine kinases in mammalian cells. In this regard, it is interesting that the insulin receptor, which escapes degradation after internalization (1Marshall S. Green A. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11464-11470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), fails to bind PI 3-kinase directly (31Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. White M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 289-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The postendocytic destiny of the EGF receptor varies. In some cells internalized receptors down-regulate efficiently (29Futter C.E. Felder S. Sclessinger J. Ullrich A. Hopkins C.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 30Herbst J.J. Opresko L.K. Walsh B. Lauffenburger D.A Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12865-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in others they recycle to the cell surface (32Dunn W.A. Connoly T.P. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 33Masui H. Castro L. Mendelsohn J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the EGF receptor binds PI 3-kinase poorly, with a 12-fold lower affinity than the PDGF receptor (34Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, in some cells EGF receptors dimerize with ErbB3, which binds PI 3-kinase with an affinity comparable with the PDGF receptor (35Fedi P. Pierce J.H. DiFiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to speculate on the possibility that the observed differences in the ability of EGF receptors to efficiently down-regulate may correlate with their ability to dimerize with ErbB3 and thus interact strongly with PI 3-kinase. The availability of wortmannin will be useful in determining whether the requirement for PI 3-kinase for receptor down-regulation is universal. PI 3-kinase in mammalian cells has been implicated in several functions of receptor tyrosine kinases, including mitogenic signaling, actin filament organization, chemotaxis, and down-regulation (36Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms whereby PI 3-kinase mediates these diverse cellular functions are unknown. It is possible that each of the lipid products of mammalian PI 3-kinase, which include PI-3-P, PI-3,4-P2, and PI-3,4,5-P3, may have unique targets and thus coordinately but independently regulate multiple cellular responses. In contrast to mammalian PI 3-kinase, yeast vps34 only phosphorylates PI to produce PI-3-P, suggesting that this lipid may be the principal product involved in protein sorting events. In summary, genetic and pharmacological evidence presented here suggests a critical requirement for PI 3-kinase activity in postendocytic trafficking and down-regulation of β-PDGF receptors. Important questions remain relating to the biochemical basis for this requirement.

The specific radioactivity of amino acids and the 13C-specific enrichment of specific carbons of free glucose, sucrose, alanine and glutamate were measured and used to calculate metabolic fluxes. The non-triose pathways, including synthesis of polysaccharides, accumulation of free hexoses, and to a lesser extent starch synthesis, were found to consume 75% of the glucose entering the root tips. The cycle of synthesis and hydrolysis of sucrose was found to consume about 70% of the ATP produced by respiration. The comparison of the specific radioactivities of amino acids and phospholipid glycerol phosphate after labeling with [1-14C] or [6-14C]glucose revealed the operation of the pentose phosphate pathway. The transfer of label from [2-14C]glucose to carbon-1 of starch glucosyl units confirmed the operation of this pathway and indicated that it is located in plastids. It was found to consume 32% of the hexose phosphates entering the triose pathways. The remaining 68% were consumed by glycolysis. The determination of the specific enrichment of carbohydrate carbons −1 and −6 after labeling with [1-13C]glucose indicated that both the conversion of triose phosphates back to hexose phosphates and the transaldolase exchange contributed to this randomization. Of the triose phosphates produced by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, about 60% were found to be recycled to hexose phosphates, and 28% were directed to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Of this 28%, two-thirds were found to be directed through the pyruvate kinase branch and one-third through the phosphoenolpyruvate branch.

Non-photosynthetic cells of higher plants depend on the supply of a carbon substrate, usually sucrose provided by leaves or storage organs, for their metabolism. Sucrose is converted to sugar phosphates, which can be used for the biosynthesis of structural or storage carbohydrates, or degraded by respiration to produce ATP and intermediates for biosynthesis (1Rees T. Preiss J. The Biochemistry of Plants. Academic Press, New York1988: 1-33Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In recent years, specific aspects of the metabolism of non-green cells have been described semi-quantitatively by label distribution studies using classical techniques of radiolabeling or NMR methods for metabolite analysis. In most plant tissues studied, cycling between hexose phosphates and sucrose was indicated by the labeling of both glucose and fructose, and of the hexosyl moieties of sucrose, from labeled glucose or fructose (2Hargreaves J.A. ap Rees T. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 1627-1629Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Wendler R. Veith R. Dancer J. Stitt M. Komor E. Planta. 1990; 183: 31-39Google Scholar). The occurrence of a futile cycle between hexose phosphates and triose phosphates was indicated by the randomization of label between C-1 and C-6 observed in sucrose, starch, and hexoses (4Keeling P.L.

In addition, the limited randomization observed in starch indicated that, in non-green tissues, hexose phosphates rather than triose phosphates enter the plastid for starch synthesis (4Keeling P.L.

However, recycling may be partial, and the transaldolase reaction is reversible (8Ljungdahl L. Wood H.G. Racker E. Couri D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1622-1625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Katz J. Rognstad R. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2227-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These simple models may thus underestimate the flux into the pentose phosphate pathway and overestimate the conversion of triose phosphate to hexose phosphate. Fluxes of carbon input into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, including the partition of the glycolytic flux at the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)1( 1The abbreviations used are: PEPphosphoenolpyruvateTCAthe flux entering the tricarboxylic acid cycleHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyPEPCPEP carboxylaseCScitrate synthase.) branch point and the malic enzyme flux (10Salon C. Raymond P. Pradet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12278-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were determined in germinating embryos of lettuce. However, the situation in this material is unusual since fatty acids rather than carbohydrates are the source of acetyl-CoA entering the citrate synthase reaction (10Salon C. Raymond P. Pradet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12278-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, little is known of the relationship between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the glucose-metabolizing tissue, which is the common situation in plants. Although most of the reactions occurring in plant intermediate metabolism have now been identified, our knowledge is still limited by the lack of quantitative determination of fluxes in extended networks. phosphoenolpyruvate the flux entering the tricarboxylic acid cycle high pressure liquid chromatography PEP carboxylase citrate synthase. Root tips of maize (Zea mays L.) are commonly used as a model for studies of energy metabolism in non-photosynthetic tissues. Their high metabolic activity makes them sensitive to limitations of oxygen or carbohydrate supply, which may determine the survival or death of the tissues. In an early work, based on the comparison of 14CO2 production from glucose labeled on C-1 or C-6, Gibbs and Beevers (11Gibbs M. Beevers H. Plant Physiol. 1955; 30: 343-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) detected no pentose phosphate pathway. As a result, it is sometimes assumed that the metabolism of the root tips of maize is very simple. The calculation of the rate of aerobic glycolysis from CO2 evolution presented by Hole et al.(12Hole D.J. Cobb B.G. Hole P.S. Drew M.C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) requires CO2 to be produced after glycolysis only, as suggested in Ref. 11Gibbs M. Beevers H. Plant Physiol. 1955; 30: 343-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and to be the only product of glucose oxidation. However, the pentose phosphate pathway is generally considered to account for 10-15% of the oxidation of carbohydrates in plant tissues (13ap Rees T. Davies D.D. The Biochemistry of Plants. Vol. 2. Academic Press, New York1980: 1-29Google Scholar). Since its main role is the supply of NADPH for biosynthesis, this pathway would be expected to be particularly active in the root tip, which is essentially a meristematic tissue. In aerobic root tips, the shortage of carbohydrate rapidly induces dramatic changes in metabolic activities, with a decrease in the rate of respiration (17Saglio P.H. Pradet A. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 516-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a change in the carbon source of respiration from carbohydrates to lipids and proteins (18Brouquisse R. James F. Raymond P. Pradet A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 19Brouquisse R. James F. Pradet A. Raymond P. Planta. 1992; 188: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) with an increase in the peroxisomal and mitochondrial β-oxidation activities (20Dieuaide M. Brouquisse R. Pradet A. Raymond P. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Dieuaide M. Couée I. Pradet A. Raymond P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the induction of proteolytic enzymes (22James F. Brouquisse R. Pradet A. Raymond P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1993; 31: 845-856Google Scholar). Similar changes have been described in other plant material such as sycamore cells in culture (23Journet E.P. Bligny R. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3193-3199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or asparagus spears (24Davies K.M. King G.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, our knowledge of the metabolic network affected by these changes is incomplete and lacks quantitative data, thus precluding any prediction of their consequences and any comprehension of the mechanisms leading to cell acclimation, or failure, under stress conditions. The aim of the present work was to identify and quantify the major metabolic fluxes of carbon metabolism of the maize root tip to gain a better understanding of its response to stress. We labeled to isotopic steady state with [14C]- or [13C]- labeled glucose and used metabolic pathway modeling to describe isotope distribution. This method has been applied successfully to animals (25Katz J. Grunnet N. Kornberg H.L. Metcalfe J.C. Northcote D.H. Pogson C.F. Tipton K.F. Techniques in the Life Sciences. Vol. B208.

Schuster R. Merle M. Canioni P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 149: 1-12Google Scholar) but has rarely been used for plants, and with monocompartmental models only (5Hatzfeld W.D. Stitt M. Planta. 1990; 180: 198-204PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hill S.A. ap Rees T. Planta. 1994; 192: 52-60Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Salon C. Raymond P. Pradet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12278-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used NMR to determine the 13C enrichment of specific carbons of carbohydrates and amino acids. Using these data, we provide estimates for 20 metabolic fluxes, from sucrose turnover to inputs into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We show definitely that the pentose phosphate pathway is active in maize root tips and that it is compartmented in the plastid; we suggest that the synthesis of pentans may account for identical 14CO2 evolution from [1-14C] or [6-14C]glucose. The use of carbon enrichments provided evidence for a contribution of the transaldolase reaction to the randomization of hexose phosphate carbons, which would not be detected from label exchange ratios. The model provided can be used to calculate fluxes from labeling data in intermediary metabolism in other plant systems. Maize seeds (Z. mays L. cv. DEA, Pioneer France Mas, France) were germinated for 3 days in the dark at 25°C as described (18Brouquisse R. James F. Raymond P. Pradet A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The 3-mm tips of primary roots were excised. Before labeling, they were starved of carbohydrates for 4 h in the medium described in Ref. 18Brouquisse R. James F. Raymond P. Pradet A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar called “medium A.” This treatment depletes starch and fructose and decreases the pools of sucrose and glucose to 20 and 50% of their initial values, respectively (17Saglio P.H. Pradet A. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 516-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Brouquisse R. James F. Raymond P. Pradet A. Plant Physiol. 1991; 96: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These tips, called “prestarved root tips,” were then transferred to medium A supplemented with 200 mM labeled glucose. This concentration of glucose is necessary to maintain their respiration rate (17Saglio P.H. Pradet A. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 516-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For 14C labeling, triplicate samples of 30 prestarved root tips were incubated in 5-ml syringes containing 2 ml of medium A with 200 mM [1-14C], [6-14C], or [2-14C]glucose (0.25-0.5 MBq/mmol) and bubbled with a N2/O2 mixture (50/50, v/v). For NMR experiments, 500 or 1000 prestarved maize root tips were incubated in medium A (50 ml/1000 tips), supplemented with 200 mM [1-13C]glucose. After incubation, the root tips were washed with abundant ice-cold water as described (28Xia J.-H. Saglio P.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to eliminate exogenous glucose and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. The 14CO2 produced was trapped by bubbling through a series of three tubes containing 2 ml of 2% KOH. At the end of incubation, the radioactivity of the KOH solutions was counted in a Packard scintillation counter. Analytical-grade mineral salts and amyloglucosidase were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and HPLC grade solvents were from Prolabo (Paris). [1-14C]Glucose (1.856 GBq/mmol), [2-14C]glucose (1.7 GBq/mmol), and [6-14C]glucose (0.263 GBq/mmol) were purchased from NEN (Paris) or Dositech (Paris), and [1-13C]glucose (99% enrichment) was purchased from Commissariat l'Energie Atomique (Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Yeast hexokinase, Leuconostoc glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and Torula yeast 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase were obtained from Sigma. The extraction of soluble components was performed using boiling aqueous solutions of ethanol, as previously described (10Salon C. Raymond P. Pradet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12278-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extract was concentrated by evaporation; water was added to make a volume of 1 or 2 ml, and this total extract was used for the preparation of lipids and water-soluble compounds. Lipids were extracted and saponified, and the fatty acids were extracted as described (29Dawson R.M.C. Hemington N. Grime D. Lander D. Kemp P. Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The radioactivity remaining in the ethanol-water phase was identified as glycerol phosphate by passing the ethanol-water phase through an anion exchange resin (Dowex 1-X8, Bio-Rad, formate). The amino acid fraction was separated by ion exchange chromatography using standard procedures (10Salon C. Raymond P. Pradet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12278-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by HPLC after derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde as described (19Brouquisse R. James F. Pradet A. Raymond P. Planta. 1992; 188: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); the specific radioactivity of each amino acid was determined as in Ref. 10Salon C. Raymond P. Pradet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12278-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. For HPLC analysis of sugars, the water-soluble extract was deionized using anion and cation exchange resins and analyzed as described (30Moing A. Carbonne F. Rashad M. Gaudillère J.P. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1878-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) on a Aminex HPX-87C column (Bio-Rad). Each peak was collected and counted for determination of the specific radioactivity. The residue of ethanolic extraction was used for the analysis of starch. It was washed successively with 20% ethanol and water (1.5 ml each for 30 roots), and starch was converted to glucose and analyzed by HPLC as described (30Moing A. Carbonne F. Rashad M. Gaudillère J.P. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1878-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Total protein was extracted and determined after mineralization as described (19Brouquisse R. James F. Pradet A. Raymond P. Planta. 1992; 188: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). For NMR analysis, glutamate was separated from the amino acid fraction as in Ref. 10Salon C. Raymond P. Pradet A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12278-12287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, passed through a Chelex 100 column, dried, and dissolved in 350 μl of D2O. The fraction containing the amino acids minus glutamate and aspartate was used for the 1H NMR analysis of alanine. The specific radioactivity of C-1 of glucose (either free glucose or glucose from starch hydrolysis) was determined after decarboxylation. The reaction was performed, according to Ref. 31Kunst A. Draeger B. Ziegenhorn J. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Vol. 6. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1984: 163-172Google Scholar, in a Warburg vial containing 2 ml of 70 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.7, 4 mM ATP, 3 mM NADP, 3.8 mM MgCl2, 6.5 mM cysteine, 3 units of hexokinase, 5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (in 20 μl of 0.2 M MgSO4/glycerol (50/50, w/w)), and 3 units of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. The center well contained a filter paper with 0.2 ml of 2% (w/v) KOH for CO2 collection. The reaction was started by adding an extract volume containing 400 nmol of glucose, and the vial was stoppered immediately. After 2 h, 200 μl of 1 M HCl, kept in the sidearm of the Warburg vial, was mixed with the reaction medium to liberate CO2. After 30 min, the filter paper was recovered, and the center well was rinsed three times with 200 μl of water; 500 μl of this solution was counted. The yield of the decarboxylation reaction, determined with standard [1-14C]glucose, was 82 ± 2%. Extracts for NMR spectroscopy analysis were evaporated to dryness under vacuum (Speed Vac) and dissolved in 350 μl of D2O. 13C NMR spectra were obtained at 100.6 MHz with a Bruker AM 400 spectrometer with a 5-mm reverse probe. Spectra were collected using the composite proton decoupling sequence, a 45° flip angle, a 4-s interpulse delay, and 16 K points. 1H NMR spectra were obtained at 400 MHz, using a 45° flip angle, a 6-s interpulse delay, and 4 K points. Except for the analysis of sugar fractions, water resonance was eliminated using a water presaturation sequence. Prior to Fourier transformation, 13C-free induction decays were zero-filled to improve digital resolution and multiplied by an exponential function to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (1.5 Hz line broadening). Peak assignment was done according to Refs. 32Cohen S.M. Glynn P. Shulman R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and 33Morris G.A. Hall L.H. Can. J. Bot. 1982; 60: 2431-2441Google Scholar and from spectra of pure compounds. The absolute 13C enrichment of glutamate carbons C-2, C-3, and C-4, of alanine C-3, of α and β glucose C-1, and of sucrose glucosyl C-1 were determined from 1H NMR spectra, as the ratio of the area of the satellites (13C-1H coupling) to the total area of the multiplet. Deconvolution of the signals was used when necessary, as in Fig. 5, Fig. 6. The relative enrichments of the glucose and sucrose carbons C-2 to C-6 were determined from 13C spectra, from the absolute enrichment of C-1 determined by 1H NMR, and the comparison of their peak areas to that of the same resonances from non-enriched sugars, the latter being equally labeled at all carbons by the 1.1% natural abundance. This method avoids the errors due to nuclear Overhauser and relaxation effects, which would occur in the determination of relative enrichments by direct comparison of peak areas in 13C spectra. The same method was used to determine the enrichment of alanine C-2 from the absolute enrichment of alanine C-3 and to confirm the enrichments of the glutamate carbons. The resolution of simultaneous algebraic equations was done using the solver DERIVE (Soft Warehouse, Inc.). The time needed to reach isotopic and metabolic steady state was determined by following the evolution of 14CO2, using [1-14C]glucose as substrate. At isotopic steady state, specific radioactivities of intermediates of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle are constant. Therefore, the rate of labeled CO2 evolution becomes constant. When root tips were not “prestarved,” the rate of labeled CO2 evolution increased continuously for more than 16 h, thus indicating that a longer incubation would be needed to reach steady state. When the endogenous pool of carbohydrates was depleted by a starvation pretreatment, the rate of labeled CO2 evolution became constant after 10 h (data not shown). The specific radioactivities of sucrose and fructose were already steady within 2 h (Fig. 1). At the same time, that of intracellular glucose was only about 60% of the final value; it then increased slowly to reach the steady-state value after 10 h. At that time, intracellular glucose and fructose had the same specific radioactivity, which was 90% that of the tracer glucose. The specific radioactivity of sucrose was twice that of glucose or fructose (Fig. 1). In 13C labeling experiments, an incubation time of 12 h was chosen. We verified on the NMR spectra that the enrichments of carbohydrates and of the amino acids glutamate and aspartate were the same at 12 and 18 h of incubation with [1-13C]glucose, thus confirming the establishment of steady state at 12 h. Root tip growth continued during incubation in the presence of glucose. Average length increased from 3 to 10 mm, and average dry weight increased from 0.35 to 0.81 mg/tip in 12 h. CO2and Amino Acid Labeling with [1-14C] or [6-14C]Glucose as Evidence for an Activity of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway-The lower enrichment of endogenous carbohydrates, compared with the precursor, might be explained by the loss of 14CO2 through the pentose phosphate pathway activity, the presence of an inactive pool of carbohydrates, and the gluconeogenesis of unlabeled carbohydrates from endogenous precursors. The hypothesis of the pentose phosphate pathway activity was tested by incubations with [1-14C]glucose and [6-14C]glucose. In agreement with earlier results (11Gibbs M. Beevers H. Plant Physiol. 1955; 30: 343-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) , no difference in the production of labeled CO2 was found between the two tracers (data not shown), indicating no pentose phosphate activity. However, as shown in Fig. 2 , the specific radioactivity of amino acids was 22-30% higher with [6-14C]glucose than with [1-14C]glucose. In the absence of the pentose phosphate pathway, this difference could be explained by the non-equilibrium of the triose phosphate isomerase reaction and the output of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (labeled with glucose C-1) to glycerol phosphate for lipid synthesis. In this case, the glycerol moiety of lipids would contain more label from [1-14C] glucose than [6-14C]glucose. However, the rate of incorporation of [1-14C]glucose into lipid glycerol phosphate was only 70% of that of [6-14C]glucose (Fig. 2D). This indicates that the specific radioactivity of dihydroxyacetone phosphate was 30% lower for [1-14C]glucose than for [6-14C]glucose. The observed similar differences in the specific radioactivities of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and alanine with [1-14C]glucose or [6-14C]glucose further indicated that the triose phosphate isomerase reaction was close to equilibrium. This disproves the hypothesis of non-equilibrium of the triose phosphates and favors the hypothesis of a flux through the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. To account for the absence of difference in the production of labeled CO2 from both tracers, we assumed extra production of 14CO2 from [6-14C]glucose in the decarboxylation of UDP-glucuronic acid to UDP-xylose for pentan synthesis; this non-triose pathway of carbohydrate metabolism is particularly active in elongating plant cells (13ap Rees T. Davies D.D. The Biochemistry of Plants. Vol. 2. Academic Press, New York1980: 1-29Google Scholar, 34Bret-Harte M.S. Silk W.K. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows a typical 13C NMR spectrum of the ethanolic extract of maize root tips after 12 h of incubation with [1-13C]glucose. Resonances assigned to glucose, sucrose, and fructose carbons are clearly visible. The spectrum shows numerous peaks of labeled intermediates related to the tricarboxylic acid cycle, including the amino acids glutamate, glutamine, aspartate, and alanine and the carboxylic acids citrate and malate. The highest amounts of 13C are at C-1 of glucose and C-1 of the glucosyl and fructosyl moieties of sucrose. The spectrum also shows appreciably more labeling at C-6 than at the other carbons of glucose and the sucrose moieties. We verified that the glucose present in the medium at the end of incubation was identical to the glucose supplied. Thus, glucose entering the maize root tips is labeled to 99% on C-1 and not labeled on the other carbons, which means that their 13C content is the natural enrichment, 1.1%. The enrichments of carbons of interest in selected metabolites are shown in Table I. The label distributions observed in the glucosyl and fructosyl moieties of sucrose were similar, with averaged enrichments of 81 ± 1% and 14.5 ± 1.5% on C-1 and C-6, respectively (Table I). Sucrose is a cytosolic compound that can be labeled on its glucosyl and fructosyl moieties when synthesized through the sucrose phosphate synthase reaction (35Geigenberger P. Stitt M. Planta. 1993; 189: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The substrates for this reaction come from the cytosolic glucose phosphate and fructose phosphate pools. Given this, the cytosolic hexose phosphates can be considered as a single pool where the C-1 or C-6 enrichments are the average enrichment of the corresponding carbons in the hexosyl moieties of sucrose (Table I). The labeling of free glucose on C-6 suggests that intracellular glucose is formed from hexose phosphates, presumably via their incorporation into sucrose and subsequent hydrolysis of sucrose by an invertase (1Rees T. Preiss J. The Biochemistry of Plants. Academic Press, New York1988: 1-33Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Hargreaves J.A. ap Rees T. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 1627-1629Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which produces free glucose and fructose. A 13C NMR spectrum of purified free fructose showed that its C-1 and C-6 were labeled (not shown), which is consistent with sucrose cycling through the sucrose phosphate synthase and invertase reactions. However, the hydrolysis of hexose phosphates by a phosphatase would have a similar effect to, and cannot be distinguished from, the sucrose phosphate synthase/invertase pathway of sucrose turnover. Intracellular free glucose showed less randomization than the hexosyl units of sucrose (Table I), which is consistent with intracellular glucose being a mixture of entering precursor and recycled sucrose-glucosyl. The presence of residual extracellular glucose would increase this difference but has previously been shown to be negligible (28Xia J.-H. Saglio P.H. Plant Physiol. 1988; 88: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table ISteady state 13C enrichments of carbohydrate and amino acid carbons after incubation of maize root tips with [1-13C]glucose The labeling of the hexose phosphate C-6, as shown in sucrose (Table I), may result from the resynthesis of fructose phosphate from triose phosphates by"

https://openalex.org/W2057457864,"We have purified a novel human serine proteinase, designated as prostasin, from seminal fluid (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have cloned and characterized the full-length cDNA encoding prostasin and identified its tissue-specific expression and cellular localization. A cDNA fragment was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate oligonucleotide primers derived from the NH2-terminal and internal amino acid sequences. A full-length cDNA sequence encoding prostasin was obtained by amplification of the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNA. It contains a 1,032-base coding region, a 572-base 3′-noncoding region and a 138-base 5′-noncoding sequence. Prostasin cDNA encodes a protein of 343 amino acids, which consists of a 32-amino acid signal peptide and a 311-amino acid proprostasin. Proprostasin is then cleaved between Arg12 and Ile13 to generate a 12-amino acid light chain and a 299-amino acid heavy chain, which are associated through a disulfide bond. The deduced amino acid sequence of the heavy chain has 34-42% identity to human acrosin, plasma kallikrein, and hepsin. A potential N-glycosylation site at Asn127 and the catalytic triad of His53, Asp102, and Ser206 have been identified. The deduced prostasin has a unique 19-amino acid hydrophobic portion at the COOH terminus, which makes it suitable to anchor in the cell membrane. Carboxyl-terminal sequencing of purified prostasin indicates that the hydrophobic portion is removed and that there is a cleavage between Arg290 and Pro291 during secretion. Southern blot analysis, following a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, indicates that prostasin mRNA is expressed in prostate, liver, salivary gland, kidney, lung, pancreas, colon, bronchus, renal proximal tubular cells, and prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. Cellular localization of prostasin mRNA was identified within epithelial cells of the human prostate gland by in situ hybridization histochemistry. We have purified a novel human serine proteinase, designated as prostasin, from seminal fluid (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have cloned and characterized the full-length cDNA encoding prostasin and identified its tissue-specific expression and cellular localization. A cDNA fragment was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate oligonucleotide primers derived from the NH2-terminal and internal amino acid sequences. A full-length cDNA sequence encoding prostasin was obtained by amplification of the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNA. It contains a 1,032-base coding region, a 572-base 3′-noncoding region and a 138-base 5′-noncoding sequence. Prostasin cDNA encodes a protein of 343 amino acids, which consists of a 32-amino acid signal peptide and a 311-amino acid proprostasin. Proprostasin is then cleaved between Arg12 and Ile13 to generate a 12-amino acid light chain and a 299-amino acid heavy chain, which are associated through a disulfide bond. The deduced amino acid sequence of the heavy chain has 34-42% identity to human acrosin, plasma kallikrein, and hepsin. A potential N-glycosylation site at Asn127 and the catalytic triad of His53, Asp102, and Ser206 have been identified. The deduced prostasin has a unique 19-amino acid hydrophobic portion at the COOH terminus, which makes it suitable to anchor in the cell membrane. Carboxyl-terminal sequencing of purified prostasin indicates that the hydrophobic portion is removed and that there is a cleavage between Arg290 and Pro291 during secretion. Southern blot analysis, following a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, indicates that prostasin mRNA is expressed in prostate, liver, salivary gland, kidney, lung, pancreas, colon, bronchus, renal proximal tubular cells, and prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. Cellular localization of prostasin mRNA was identified within epithelial cells of the human prostate gland by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Human seminal fluid is a rich source of proteolytic enzymes, many of which are involved in the postejaculatory hydrolysis of proteins and in semen coagulation and liquefaction (Shivaji et al., 1990Shivaji S. Scheit K.-H. Bhargava P.M. Proteins of Seminal Plasma. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar). Prostate-specific antigen and acrosin are two of the most important proteolytic enzymes found in human semen. Prostate-specific antigen may play an important role in semen liquefaction through hydrolyzing semenogelin, a predominant seminal vesicle protein (Lilia, 1985Lilia H. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Prostate-specific antigen levels in blood have been recognized recently as the most important marker for prostate cancer. Acrosin is a serine proteinase present in acrosomes, where it covers the anterior part of the sperm head (Klemm et al., 1991Klemm U. Muller-Esterl W. Engel W. Hum. Genet. 1991; 87: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is believed to be involved in recognition, binding, and penetration of the zona pellucida of the ovum during interaction of the sperm and egg (Jones et al., 1988Jones R. Brown C.R. Lancaster R.T. Development. 1988; 102: 781-792Google Scholar; Topfer-Petersen and Henschen, 1988Topfer-Petersen E. Henschen A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, we have identified and purified a new serine proteinase, designated as prostasin, from human seminal fluid (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the present time, the physiological functions of prostasin are unknown, and its physiological substrate remains to be identified. Prostasin has an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and displays arginine amidolytic activity. The NH2-terminal 20-amino acid sequence of prostasin shares 50-55% identity with human α-tryptase, elastase 2A and 2B, chymotrypsin, acrosin, and the catalytic chains of hepsin, plasma kallikrein, and coagulation factor XI (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is present in many tissues and has the highest level in the prostate gland. In the prostate gland, prostasin has been localized in epithelial cells and ducts by immunohistochemistry. It is believed that prostasin is synthesized in prostatic epithelial cells, secreted into the ducts, and excreted into the seminal fluid, where it may serve a role in fertilization. The wide distribution of prostasin outside the prostate gland indicates that it may also play important roles in other biological processes. In order to understand the structure, regulation, and function of prostasin, it is essential to isolate and characterize its cDNA. In this study, we have cloned the full-length cDNA encoding prostasin through polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1( 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsTPCK-trypsinL-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsinMCA4-methylcoumarin-7-amideDIGdigoxigenin.) and 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) based on its NH2-terminal and internal amino acid sequences. We have elucidated its primary structure and defined the posttranslational processes that convert preproprostasin into proprostasin and prostasin. In addition, we have identified the cleavage site where prostasin is released from membranes. Tissue-specific expression of prostasin has been identified by reverse transcription PCR followed by Southern blot analysis. Cellular localization of prostasin mRNA in the human prostate gland has been determined by in situ hybridization. polymerase chain reaction high performance liquid chromatography rapid amplification of cDNA ends L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin 4-methylcoumarin-7-amide digoxigenin. Prostasin was purified from human seminal plasma as described previously (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified prostasin (40 μg) was digested with TPCK-trypsin (Sigma) at a ratio of 1:100 (w/w) at 37°C for 16 h after reduction by dithiothreitol and S-carboxymethylation by iodoacetic acid according to the procedure described by Stone et al., 1989Stone K.L. LoPresti M.B. Crawford J.M. DeAngelis R. Williams K.R. Matsudaira P.T. A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification for Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1989: 37-42Google Scholar. Generated peptide fragments were separated by a reverse phase HPLC (model 5000 liquid chromatograph; Varian Associates, Inc.) with a μBondapak C18 column (3.9 mm × 30 cm, Water, Inc.) and eluted by an acetonitrile gradient. The collected fractions were concentrated by Speedvac to a desired volume and subjected to amino acid sequencing using a gas phase protein sequenator equipped with an on-line narrow bore phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer (ABI model 470 A, Applied Biosystems Inc.). A human prostate cDNA library in λ gt 11 (Clontech Lab, Inc.) was amplified with forward and backward primers corresponding to the two arms of the phage DNA. The reaction mixture contained 1 × PCR buffer (0.5 mM dNTP, 100 pmol of primers, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 × 107 phage of the cDNA library, and 2.5 units of Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction was conducted in a GeneMachine II (USA/Scientific Plastics, Ocala, FL) using the following program: 94°C for 1 min, 42°C for 2 min, 72°C for 3 min for 30 cycles followed by 5 min at 72°C. According to the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of purified prostasin, ITGGSSAVAGQWPWQVSITY (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the internal amino acid sequences obtained above, two degenerate primers were designed. The sense primer is JY-1, 5′-GTNGCNGGNCARTGGCC-3′, which corresponds to VAGQWP in the NH2-terminal sequence; the antisense primer is JY-T84-2, 5′-TTNGCRTCDATRTTRTA-3′, corresponding to YNIDAK in peptide T84 (see “Results”).2( 2N represents A, C, G, or T; R represents A or G; and D represents A, G, or T.) To amplify a partial prostasin cDNA fragment, 2 μl of the amplified human prostate cDNA library was used as template in the following PCR reaction: 1 × PCR buffer, 0.25 mM dNTP, 0.05 mM tetramethylammonium chloride, 100 pmol of JY-1 and JY-T84-2, and 2.5 units of Ampli-Taq DNA polymerase. The cycling program was the same as mentioned above. A second round of PCR was carried out with 10 μl of the first round product as template and the same primers under the same conditions. After purification, the amplified products were subjected to Southern blot analysis using a nested degenerate oligonucleotide, JY-4, which is located just downstream of the sense-primer JY-1. The sequence of JY-4 is 5′-CARTGGCCNTGGCARGT-3′, which corresponds to QWPWQV at the NH2 terminus of the purified prostasin. A 300-base pair DNA fragment that hybridized to JY-4 oligonucleotide was sequenced using JY-4 as a primer with the Life Technologies, Inc. dsDNA cycle sequencing system. A partial prostasin cDNA sequence with a size of approximately 300 bases was obtained from the above experiment. Based on this sequence, a sense primer, JY-F1 (5′-GTCCATGTGTGTGGTGG-3′), was used with total RNA from human renal proximal tubular cells in the 3′-RACE reaction (Life Technologies, Inc.). A nested primer, JY-AD (5′-CTGTCAGCTGCTCACTGC-3′) was used to sequence the product of the 3′-RACE reaction to reveal the 3′-end of prostasin cDNA. The antisense primer JY-B1 (5′-TGGGTCTGCTGAGTTGG-3′) was exploited for reverse transcription in the 5′-RACE reaction. After adding an oligo(dC) anchor sequence to the 3′-end with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, the generated cDNA was amplified with a nested antisense primer, JY-UA (5′-CTCCTGGAGGTAGCTGG-3′), and an anchor primer provided by the manufacturer in the 5′-RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The amplified product was sequenced with primer JY-AU (5′-GCAGTGAGCAGCTGACAG-3′) to reveal the 5′-end of prostasin cDNA. Prostasin was purified from human seminal fluid as described previously by Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. In order to explore whether there were two chains linked by a disulfide bond, the purified prostasin was resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.). The protein band was cut out for NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing. Since the deduced prostasin has a putative transmembrane domain at the COOH terminus (Fig. 1), this hydrophobic portion is likely to be removed in the secreted prostasin. To explore this possibility, 60 μg of purified prostasin from human seminal fluid was dissolved in 0.2 MN-ethylmorpholine acetate (pH 8.3), and a mixture of carboxypeptidase A and carboxypeptidase B was added to prostasin at a molar ratio of 1:50. The reaction was carried out at 37°C, and an aliquot of the incubation mixture was removed for amino acid composition analysis at 1, 5, and 19 h. After 19 h of incubation, the pH of the test protein mixture was lowered to 6.0 with acetic acid, and carboxypeptidase Y was added to the remaining prostasin at a 1:50 ratio. An aliquot of the incubation mixture was removed at 1 and 19 h for amino acid composition analysis. Human tissues were obtained from autopsy and kindly provided by Dr. Sandra Conradi at the Medical University of South Carolina. Renal proximal tubular cells were obtained from Dr. Debra Hazen-Martin at the Medical University of South Carolina (Detrisac et al., 1984Detrisac C.J. Sens M.A. Garvin A.J. Spicer S.S. Sens D.A. Kidney Int. 1984; 25: 383-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. Tissues were handled as reported by Chai et al., 1993Chai K.X. Chen L.M. Chao J. Chao L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24498-24505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and total RNA was isolated according to the procedure described by Davis et al., 1986Davis L.G. Dibner M.D. Battey J.F. Basic Methods in Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New York1986: 130-135Crossref Google Scholar. Total RNAs extracted from various tissues were subjected to reverse transcription PCR using the sense primer JY-F1 and antisense primer JY-B1. The PCR product was confirmed by Southern blot analysis with probe JY-AD (Maniatis et al., 1982Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 382-389Google Scholar). Prostasin cDNA was amplified with two primers, JY-F1 and JY-B1, after reverse transcription using total RNA from LNCaP cells. A 255-base pair fragment was gel-purified from an agarose gel and ligated into pSP73 at the HindII site. The recombinant plasmid was used to transform E. coli JM101. Positive colonies were selected by colony hybridization with oligonucleotide JY-AD, and the orientation of the cDNA fragment in the vector was determined by DNA sequencing. The sense and the antisense RNAs, corresponding to the partial prostasin cDNA, were synthesized by using SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases, respectively. During the synthesis of the RNAs, digoxigenin-labeled uridine-triphosphate (DIG-UTP) was incorporated according to the protocol of Boehringer Mannheim. The DIG-labeled antisense RNA (riboprobe) was used to detect prostasin mRNA in 5-μm sections of human prostate that was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. DIG-labeled sense RNA was used as a control. An antibody-conjugate (anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphate conjugate) was used to recognize the DIG-labeled RNA. A subsequent enzyme-catalyzed color reaction was conducted by the addition of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium salt and incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark as described by the manufacturer. After washing and dehydration, sections were mounted with Permount. Purified prostasin was subjected to TPCK-trypsin cleavage, and as many as 15 peptide fragments were isolated by reverse phase HPLC with a C18 column. Five of the peptide fragments were subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing. The peptides are T45 (LGAHQLDSYSE), T59 (ASSYASWIQSK), T75 (NRPGVYTLASSYAS), T77 (YIRPIXLPAAXASFP), and T84 (ETXNXLYNIDAKPEEPHFVQ), where X represents an undetermined amino acid. A degenerate oligonucleotide, JY-T84-2, with the least degree of degeneracy at 96 was synthesized as an antisense primer corresponding to the amino acid sequence YNIDAK in peptide T84. Two degenerate sense primers, JY-1 and JY-4, with degrees of degeneracy at 128 and 16, respectively, were designed according to the previously obtained NH2-terminal amino acid sequence ITGGSSAVAGQWPWQVSITY (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the nucleic acid sequence of prostasin cDNA and its deduced amino acid sequence. Prostasin cDNA consists of a coding region of 1,032 bases, a 3′-noncoding region of 572 bases, and a 5′-noncoding region. The coding region starts with an ATG codon, which is present in a sequence of GTCCTGGCCATGG, similar to the consensus sequence GCCGCCRCCATGG for the eukaryotic translational initiation site (Kozak, 1987Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). The cDNA encodes a 343-amino acid polypeptide, including a 32-amino acid signal peptide, a 12-amino acid light chain, and a 299-amino acid heavy chain beginning with Ile-Thr-Gly-Gly, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of purified prostasin reported by Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. A potential N-linked glycosylation site has been identified as Asn127 in a sequence of Asn-Ala-Ser, and a variant polyadenylation signal, ATTAAA, was found 12 bases upstream of the poly(A). Fig. 2 compares the deduced prostasin amino acid sequence with other serine proteinases. Prostasin shares 34-42% identity to human plasma kallikrein, coagulation factor XI, β-tryptase, hepsin, plasminogen, and acrosin. The catalytic triad of the deduced prostasin has been identified as His53, Asp102, and Ser206 according to the multiple sequence alignment. In alignment with other serine proteinases (Fig. 2), prostasin contains an Asp residue at position 200, indicating that it has trypsin-like activity. A hydropathy plot of the deduced prostasin identifies two hydrophobic regions, one located at the NH2 terminus and the other at the COOH terminus (Fig. 3). The one located at the NH2 terminus is likely to be a signal peptide, which could direct newly synthesized prostasin to enter the endoplasmic reticulum. The other region located at the COOH terminus is indicated as a putative transmembrane domain and is double-underlined in Fig. 1.Fig. 3Hydropathy plot of the deduced prostasin. The hydropathy of prostasin's amino acid sequence translated from its cDNA was predicted with MacProMass program and plotted with the Kyte & Doolittle Hydropathic index using a window size of 10 residues. Amino acid numbering begins with the start codon Met.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Under nonreducing conditions, two distinct signals were observed on chromatograms in each Edman degradation cycle of the purified prostasin. However, under reducing conditions only one signal was obtained (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two amino acid sequences obtained are ITGGSSAVAGQW, which is the same as the previously published NH2-terminal amino acid sequence under reducing conditions (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and AEAPXGVAPQ. Examination of the deduced prostasin amino acid sequence from its cDNA indicates that AEAPXGVAPQ is located just upstream from ITGGSSAVAGQW and that the X is a cysteine residue. This result shows that the nascent prostasin is a preproenzyme, which is converted to proenzyme by removing a 32-amino acid signal peptide. The generated proprostasin is then activated by the cleavage of a peptide bond between Arg12 and Ile13 to give rise to active prostasin, which contains a light chain of 12 amino acids and a heavy chain of 299 amino acids. The two chains are held together by a disulfide bond. The result of carboxypeptidase digestion indicates that the first released amino acid residue is Arg, followed by either Leu or Ala. No release of His311, the last amino acid residue of prostasin deduced from its cDNA, can be observed. The total amount of released Arg is substantially higher than that of Leu or Ala, indicating that there are two carboxyl-terminal Arg residues. Considering that a light chain and a heavy chain exist in the purified prostasin, the signals obtained from carboxypeptidase digestion represent two COOH-terminal sequences. Since the last two amino acids of the light chain are Ala-Arg, the COOH terminus of the heavy chain must be Leu-Arg. Compared with the deduced prostasin sequence, there is a Leu-Arg sequence just upstream from the putative transmembrane domain at the COOH terminus. Therefore, it is believed that a cleavage occurs between Arg290 and Pro291. Prostasin mRNA expression was detected in several human tissues with reverse transcription PCR followed by Southern blot analysis using a specific oligonucleotide probe. The result shows that prostasin is expressed in the human prostate gland, liver, salivary gland, kidney, lung, pancreas, colon, bronchus, renal proximal tubular cells, and LNCaP cells, but not in the testis, ovary, spleen, uterus, cortex, muscle, atrium, ventricle, aorta, vein, artery, umbilical vein endothelial cells, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear cells (Fig. 4). Cellular localization of prostasin mRNA has been identified within the epithelial cells of the human prostate gland using the antisense riboprobe by in situ hybridization histochemistry (Fig. 5a). No staining was observed in the control section using the sense riboprobe (Fig. 5b). In this study, we have cloned and sequenced a full-length cDNA encoding prostasin, a human serine proteinase. This cDNA codes for a protein of 343 amino acids with a 32-amino acid signal peptide. The catalytic triad essential for enzymatic activity of prostasin is His53, Asp102, and Ser206. The sequences around these active sites are highly conserved in the serine proteinases as shown in Fig. 2, and the heavy chain of prostasin shares 34-42% identity with them. A potential glycosylation site, Asn127, has been identified. A putative transmembrane domain is present at the COOH terminus, suggesting that prostasin is likely to be a membrane-anchored serine proteinase. Prostasin is expressed in a variety of human tissues, and its mRNA is localized within epithelial cells of the prostate gland. Based on the amino acid sequence deduced from its cDNA, the posttranslational processing sites of prostasin have been defined. The posttranslational process of prostasin is very similar to that of acrosin, which produces a 23-amino acid light chain associated with the heavy chain by two disulfide bonds (Klemm et al., 1991Klemm U. Muller-Esterl W. Engel W. Hum. Genet. 1991; 87: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Prostasin is synthesized as a preproenzyme of 343 amino acids. During translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, a cleavage occurs between Gly−1 and Ala1 to remove the 32-amino acid signal peptide generating proprostasin. This cleavage site agrees with the motif that requires small neutral amino acid residues at positions −3 and −1 (von Heijne, 1990von Heijne G. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 115: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The generated proenzyme with 311 amino acids is then activated by a specific cleavage between Arg12 and Ile13 to produce an active, two-chain form. The two chains are held together by an interchain disulfide bond between Cys5 in the light chain and a Cys residue in the heavy chain. Like acrosin, prostasin has a unique protruding COOH terminus (Fig. 2). Acrosin is a serine proteinase membrane-anchored through its COOH terminus by an unknown mechanism and is then released after cleavage (Baba et al., 1989Baba T. Watanabe K. Kashiwabara S.-I. Arai Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). At the COOH terminus of prostasin, there is a highly hydrophobic portion of 19 amino acids, which are rich in leucine and flanked by a positively or a negatively charged amino acid at either side (Arg and Glu). This indicates that prostasin is likely to be a membrane-bound serine proteinase. Similarly, angiotensin-converting enzyme has a 17-amino acid hydrophobic portion near its COOH terminus, which has been identified as a transmembrane domain (Wei et al., 1991Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Soubrier F. Michaud A. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5540-5546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After cleavage, angiotensin-converting enzyme is released, and its COOH-terminal portion remains on the membrane (Beldent et al., 1993Beldent V. Michaud A. Wei L. Chauvet M-T. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26428-26434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Carboxypeptidase digestion shows that the COOH-terminal amino acids of the purified prostasin's heavy chain are Leu-Arg, indicating that there is a cleavage between Arg290 and Pro291 in the deduced prostasin. There are two Arg residues in the COOH terminus of the deduced prostasin, Arg259 and Arg290. Obviously, the peptide bond between Arg290 and Pro291 is preferred over that between Arg259 and Val260 since Pro258 cannot be detected after carboxypeptidase digestion. This result was verified by immunoblot analysis using a specific antiserum against an 11-amino acid peptide, Pro262-Gln263-Thr264-Gln265-Glu266-Ser267-Gln268-Pro269-Asp270-Ser271-Asn272, which recognized purified prostasin (data not shown). Analysis of the amino acid composition of purified prostasin's heavy chain also suggests that the Leu-rich hydrophobic portion is missing since the Leu content is much lower than that in the deduced one (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that prostasin loses its COOH-terminal hydrophobic portion during secretion. Compared with other serine proteinases, the number and positions of 9 out of the 11 cysteine residues in the catalytic chain of the translated prostasin are highly conserved (Fig. 2). On the basis of the known disulfide bridge arrangement in serine proteinases (Young et al., 1978Young C.L. Barker W.C. Tomaselli C.M. Dayhoff M.O. Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequences and Structure. vol. 5. NBR Foundation, Washington, DC1978: 73-93Google Scholar), four intrachain disulfide bonds are expected at cysteine pairs 38/54, 136/212, 169/191, and 202/230 in prostasin (Fig. 1). Except for the single-chained β-tryptase, Cys122 is conserved in all of the serine proteinases listed in Fig. 2. This cysteine residue has been found to be involved in the formation of an interchain disulfide bond with the noncatalytic chain in plasma kallikrein, coagulation factor XI, and acrosin (McMullen et al., 1991aMcMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar; McMullen et al., 1991bMcMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2056-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar; Topfer-Petersen et al., 1990Topfer-Petersen E. Calvete J. Schafer W. Henschen A. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Considering that purified prostasin consists of two chains held by a disulfide bond, we conclude that an interchain disulfide bond exists between Cys5 and Cys122. In addition, prostasin has two unique cysteine residues at positions 171 and 274 (Fig. 1). Whether these cysteine residues form a disulfide bond remains to be explored. A potential N-linked glycosylation site, Asn-Ala-Ser, has been identified at Asn127. The presence of this site explains why purified prostasin under reducing conditions displayed a larger size (40 kDa) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis than the deduced heavy chain of 32 kDa. Asn127, which was included in tryptic peptide T77 and described as X, could not be identified in amino acid sequencing although the signals before and after the Asn residue were very strong (data not shown). Furthermore, Asn residues in tryptic peptide T84 were easily identified. This phenomenon indicates that Asn127 has been modified by carbohydrates which make it nondetectable. In addition to N-linked glycosylation, it is likely that O-linked glycosylation is present in prostasin, since there are many serine and threonine residues in the deduced amino acid sequence of prostasin. This modification might also contribute to the discrepancy between the molecular masses of the deduced and the purified protein. On synthetic substrates, prostasin shows trypsin-like activities, such as arginine amidolytic activities on D-Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA and D-Phe-Phe-Arg-MCA (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lysine amidolytic activities on succinyl-Ala-Phe-Lys-MCA and t-butyloxycarbonyl-Val-Leu-Lys-MCA (data not shown). It has no enzymatic activity on chymotrypsin substrates such as succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-MCA (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the fact that in the deduced prostasin, an Asp residue is present at position 200, which is located six residues before the active site Ser206. This Asp residue, which is located at the bottom of the substrate-binding pocket in trypsin, is involved in an interaction with the Arg or Lys residue of a substrate (Ruhlmann et al., 1973Ruhlmann A. Kukla D. Schwager P. Bartels K. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 77: 417-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, Gly227 and Gly237 are conserved in prostasin. The counterparts of these two Gly residues in trypsin are present at the entrance of the substrate-binding pocket and permit entry of large amino acid side chains. Thus, these features in prostasin's primary structure determine its trypsin-like cleavage preference. Broad existence of prostasin mRNA in human tissues suggests that it may have important biological functions. Localization of prostasin mRNA in the epithelial cells of the prostate gland indicates that prostasin is synthesized in the cells and then secreted into the ducts. The presence of prostasin in prostatic epithelial cells and ducts was identified by immunohistochemistry in our previous studies (Yu et al., 1994Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since it is likely to be a membrane-bound serine proteinase, prostasin may be involved in some important processes on the surface of cell membranes, such as removal of propeptides from hormones and growth factors and the activation of proenzymes associated with membranes. In order to understand prostasin's physiological functions, further experimentation is needed. We thank Dr. Carmelann Zintz and Gary Richards for critical review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1994231910,"We investigated the mechanism of action of the human prolactin (hPRL) receptor on four different breast cancer cell lines, T-47D, MCF-7, BT-474, and SK-BR3, that express elevated levels of the receptor compared with normal cells. Cells treated with human growth hormone (hGH), which binds and activates the hPRL receptor, exhibited bell-shaped dose-response growth curves consistent with the sequential dimerization mechanism proposed for the hPRL receptor (Fuh, G., Colosi, P., Wood, W.I., and Wells, J.A.(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 5376-5381). Growth stimulation was enhanced by Zn2+, which preferentially increases the affinity of hGH for the hPRL receptor. Furthermore, receptor-selective variants of hGH that bind the hPRL receptor but not the hGH receptor were agonistic, providing additional support that specific binding to the hPRL receptor can stimulate these breast cancer cells to grow. On this basis we produced variants of hGH and human placental lactogen (hPL) that were potential antagonists because they bind but do not dimerize the hPRL receptor. The hPL-based antagonist was less potent than the hGH-based antagonist toward the growth of MCF-7 cells, consistent with the lower affinity of hPL for hPRL receptor than for hGH. However, the hPL-based antagonist was more potent than the hGH antagonist for BT-474 cells. Antibodies to the hPRL receptor inhibited growth of FDC-P1 cells transfected with the hPRL receptor; these also inhibited MCF-7 cells and T47D cells but not BT-474 cells. A unique feature of BT-474 cells was found when screening its cDNA revealed the presence of a novel alternative splice of the hPRL receptor that codes for the soluble extracellular domain; this may explain these differential inhibitory effects.

INTRODUCTIONBreast cancer affects one in every eight women in the United States and is a significant cause of death (Kelsey and Gammon, 1991Kelsey J.L. Gammon M.D. CA Cancer J. Clin. 1991; 41: 146-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It has been shown that hPRL1( 1The abbreviations used are: hPRLhuman prolactinhGHhuman growth hormonehPLhuman placental lactogenhPRLbpthe extracellular domain of the hPRL receptorFBSfetal bovine serumPCRpolymerase chain reactionmutants are designated by the wild-type residue (in single-letter code) followed by its position and the mutant residuemultiple mutants are indicated by a series of single mutants separated by slashes.) receptors are present in 40-70% of tumor biopsies (Bonneterre et al., 1990; Murphy et al., 1984Murphy J.L. Murphy L.C. Vrhovesek E. Sutherland R.L. Lazarus L. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 1963-1968PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, many breast cancer cell lines express 2-10 times more hPRL receptors than normal cells (Shiu, 1979Shiu R.P.C. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 4381-4386PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). Lactogenic hormones such as hPRL or hPL that bind specifically to the hPRL receptor can stimulate the growth of human breast cancer cell lines (Shiu and Iwasiow, 1985Shiu R.P.C. Iwasiow B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11307-11313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Manni et al., 1986Manni A. Wright C. Davis G. Glenn J. Joehl R. Feil P.

Although it is believed that lactogenic hormones may play a role in the growth and development of breast cancer in animal models (Phares, 1986Phares C.K. Anticancer Res. 1986; 6: 845-848PubMed Google Scholar; Platica et al., 1991Platica M. Doody J. Mandeli J.P. Hollander V.P. Int. J.

Cancer. 1991; 49: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the importance of these hormones in the human disease is still unclear. For example, higher circulating levels of lactogenic hormones have been found in breast cancer patients by some investigators (Maddox et al., 1992Maddox P.R. Jones D.L. Mansel R.E. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) but not by others (Love et al., 1991Love R.R. Rose D.R. Surawics T.S. Newcomb P.A. Cancer. 1991; 68: 1401-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Table IhPRL receptors are abundant in various human breast cancer cell linesThe hPRL receptor has been cloned from mammary cancer cells (Boutin et al., 1989Boutin J.M. Edery M. Shirota M. Jolicoeur C. Lesueur L. Ali S. Gould D. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1455-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It contains a single extracellular domain, a transmembrane, and an intracellular domain. Ligand-induced dimerization is believed to be responsible for signaling. Mutational studies have shown that hormones that can activate the receptor contain two binding sites for the receptor, Site 1 and Site 2 (Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; for review, see Wells and De Vos, 1993Wells J.A. De Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These sites bind in a sequential fashion where the hormone binds first through Site 1 and then Site 2 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies to the PRL receptor can cause weak signaling (Djiane et al., 1985Djiane J. Dusanter-Fourt I. Katoh M. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11430-11435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 1Sequential dimerization model for activation of the hPRL receptor by hGH, hPL, or hPRL. These hormones have two sites for binding the hPRL receptor. Binding occurs first through Site 1 (middlepanel) and then Site 2 (lowerpanel). At very high concentrations the hormone can antagonize itself by blocking receptors using Site 1 and thus prevent dimerization (bottompanel). Figure taken from Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and published with permission.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A homolog of hGH, hPL, can also activate the hPRL receptor. Unlike hPRL, hPL and hGH require Zn2+ to bind the hPRL receptor via Site 1 (Cunningham et al., 1990Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar; Lowman et al.,1991). The structural basis for this was elaborated in a recent x-ray crystal structure of the complex between hGH and the extracellular domain of the hPRL receptor (Somers et al., 1994Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Based upon the sequential dimerization mechanism it has been possible to build hPRL receptor antagonists that bind to the receptor via a normal Site 1 but do not allow efficient dimerization because of a mutation introduced into Site 2 (Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we investigate the mechanism of action of the hPRL receptor on four different human breast cancer cell lines. We find these cells can be stimulated to grow by addition of hGH, and the growth activation pattern fits the sequential dimerization model for the hPRL receptor. Furthermore, antagonists to the hPRL receptor inhibit the growth of these cells. Surprisingly, not all breast cancer cell lines respond equivalently to these antagonists. In particular, one cell line (BT-474) is more potently inhibited by an hPL (not an hGH) antagonist and produced transcripts that coded for a novel form of the extracellular domain of the prolactin receptor. These studies provide further support for the importance of the hPRL receptor in breast cancer and suggest that antagonists to it may help to treat the disease.MATERIALS AND METHODST-47D cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. The other breast cancer cell lines, BT-474, MCF-7, and SK-BR3, were provided by G. Lewis at Genentech. hGH was from Genentech, and variants of hGH (G120R, K168A/E174A, and D171A/R64A) were provided by B. Cunningham at Genentech. hPL and hPRL were from B. DeVos at Genentech. The G120R-hPL mutant was made by site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel et al., 1987Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4543) Google Scholar) and purified as described (Lowman et al., 1991Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10982-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hPRLbp was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (Cunningham et al., 1990Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody (405) to the HER-2 (405) was provided by P. Carter at Genentech. Polyclonal antibodies to the hPRLbp (PC4) were generated in rabbits, using the hPRLbp as an immunogen, and purified on an hPRLbp affinity column as described (Cunningham et al., 1990Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).Cell Proliferation Assay for Testing Agonists and AntagonistsBreast cancer cells were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham nutrient mixture F-12 medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 10% FBS. For assays, 1 × 104 trypsinized cells were added to each well of a 96-well plate and allowed to incubate at 37°C for 6-18 h in media with 1% diafiltered FBS before hormones were added. The final assay medium had 15 μM of ZnSO4 and either 1% diafiltered FBS for assaying agonists or 3% FBS for assaying antagonists. We used diafiltered FBS to remove potential small molecule growth agonists (like steroids) and to better control the amount of zinc salts present. Trypsinization followed by incubation in low serum media served to fast the cells before hormone treatments. When assaying MCF-7 cells, no zinc was added because additional zinc increased the background growth, making the antagonists less effective. After incubating cells with the hormones for 3 or 4 days, cells were pulsed with 1 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Corp.) for 6 h. The cells were harvested onto the glass filters, and radioactivity was measured in a scintillation counter (Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard errors were calculated from three to five replicate samples at each hormone concentration. The proliferation assay of FDC-P1 cells transfected with the hPRL receptor was performed as described (Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in suspension with hGH, and the hGH was removed 24 h prior to each assay. About 4 × 104 cells were added to each well and incubated with the indicated hormone for 18 h. Cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine for 4 h before harvesting. The assay medium was supplemented with 1% horse serum to reduce the background growth. Competitive displacement of [125I]hGH was used to determine the affinity of hGH analogs for hPRLbp as described (Cunningham et al., 1990Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).Cloning of a Variant Form of the hPRL ReceptormRNA was extracted from BT-474 and T-47D cells and primed with random hexameric oligonucleotides. Degenerate PCR primer pairs were designed from the most conserved regions of the hPRL receptors and hGH receptors. PCR was performed with Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) at an annealing temperature of 55°C on cDNA derived from about 0.13 μg of mRNA. The PCR fragments were then cloned into the pCR™II vector (Invitrogen). The PCR fragments from individual clones were digested with two restriction enzymes, and the fragments were compared with those of the hGH or hPRL receptor by agarose gel electrophoresis. The clones having a restriction digest pattern different from that of the hGH or hPRL receptor were sequenced. The presence of the transcript for the alternatively spliced form of the hPRL receptor was confirmed by PCR of the cDNA with variant specific primers at a higher annealing temperature (72°C).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONActivation of the hPRL Receptor Can Stimulate Breast Cancer Cells To GrowFour breast cancer cell lines (T-47D, MCF-7, BT-474, and SK-BR3) were chosen for study based on the fact that they have different numbers of hPRL receptors/cell (Table I). We first wished to establish whether hGH could stimulate these cells to proliferate in our system, and if so determine the characteristics of the activated receptor.Both T-47D cells (see Fig. 2A) and SK-BR3 cells (see Fig. 2B) showed a bell shape when treated with increasing concentrations of hGH. The bell shape reflects the sequential dimerization mechanism for activation (Fig. 1) seen when hGH is added to FDC-P1 cells transfected with either the hGH (Fuh et al., 1992Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) or hPRL receptor (Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maximal enhancement in cell growth observed in these and other studies on MCF-7 and BT-474 cells (not shown), varied from 110 to 160% of the untreated control depending on the cell line. While the maximal response may vary from experiment to experiment, each dose-response curve showed the characteristic bell shape. The modest enhancement in hGH-simulated growth suggests that these cells are growing at near maximal rate in the assays. This is not surprising since there are a wide variety of growth stimulants in serum used in the assay media (Biswas and Vonderhaar, 1987Biswas R. Vonderhaar B.K. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3509-3514PubMed Google Scholar), and breast cancer cells have been shown to produce their own growth factors (Huff et al., 1988Huff K.K. Knabbe C. Lindsey R. Kaufmann D. Bronzert D. Lippman M.E. Dickson R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Growth stimulation of breast cancer cells T-47D (panel A) or SK-BR3 (panel B) upon addition of hGH or hGH analogs. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of hormone as indicated for 4 days.

B, wild type hGH (●), K168A/E174A (■), or R64A/D171A (□), all with 15 μM ZnSO4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies have shown that Zn2+ enhances binding of hGH and activation of the hPRL receptor, but it does not affect binding of hGH to the hGH receptor (Cunningham et al., 1990Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar; Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of hGH required for half-maximal stimulation of T-47D cells (EC50) was shifted from ~1 nM to ~0.1 nM when additional Zn2+ was provided to the cells (Fig. 2A). Receptor-selective variants of hGH have been made that bind specifically to either the hGH or hPRL receptors (Cunningham and Wells, 1991Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3407-3411Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The thymidine incorporation of SK-BR3 cells was stimulated by a variant that binds selectively to the hPRL receptor (R64A/D171A) but not by one that binds selectively to the hGH receptor (K168A/E174A) (Fig. 2B). Similar results were found for T-47D cells (not shown). hPRL is known to bind only the hPRL and not hGH receptor. Treatment of T-47D cells with 2 and 20 nM hPRL resulted in thymidine incorporation that was 108 ± 18 and 138 ± 7% of untreated cells, which was similar to the DNA synthesis in cells treated with hGH. These studies show that hGH and hPRL can modestly stimulate these cells to grow and suggest that these hormones exert their effect through binding and dimerization of an hPRL-like receptor.Antagonists to the hPRL Receptor Inhibit hGH-stimulated GrowthFDC-P1 cells transfected with the full-length hPRL receptor can be stimulated to grow with either hGH or hPRL (Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An hGH analog, G120R, antagonizes hGH-stimulation of these cells because it blocks binding at Site 2 and does not allow receptor dimerization (Fig. 1). When T-47D cells were stimulated to grow with 1 nM hGH, growth could be inhibited by the G120R analog in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Antagonism of T-47D cells with G120R-hGH (●) (panel A), FDC-P1 cells transfected with the hPRL receptor by G120R-hGH (●) or G120R-hPL (○) (panel B), MCF-7 cells with G120R-hGH (●) or G120R-hPL (○) (panel C), and BT474 cells by G120R-hGH with ZnSO4 (●) or without ZnSO4 (○) or by G120R-hPL with ZnSO4 (■) or without ZnSO4 (□) (panel D). T-47D cells and transfected FDC-P1 cells were incubated with 1 nM hGH plus the serial dilutions of antagonists. MCF-7 cells and BT-474 cells did not require additional hGH for maximal stimulation and were treated with increasing concentrations of the indicated antagonists. The 100% value for all panels represents data from control cells treated with assay media alone. See “Materials and Methods” for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)hPL binds selectively to the hPRL receptor, albeit about 10-fold weaker than hGH. Like hGH, it requires Zn2+ for binding the hPRL receptor (Lowman et al., 1991Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10982-10988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We produced the G120R variant of hPL and found that it inhibits hGH-stimulated growth of the FDC-P1 cells transfected with the hPRL receptor (Fig. 3B). The IC50 for G120R-hPL was about 8-fold higher than for G120R-hGH.Growth of MCF-7 and BT-474 cells is only marginally stimulated by additional hGH. We hypothesized that sufficient amounts of a lactogen (or other growth factors) may be present in serum or produced by MCF-7 cells and BT-474 to maximally stimulate them to grow. We therefore tested whether growth of these cells in serum could be inhibited by addition of either the hGH or hPL G120R analog. Indeed, in the case of MCF-7 cells, both analogs could inhibit growth, and the inhibition by G120R-hGH was nearly 90% (Fig. 3C). The G120R-hPL was about 10-fold less potent than the G120R-hGH analog, consistent with its weaker binding to the hPRL receptor.These results were in contrast to those found in BT-474 cells (Fig. 3D). Here, the G120R-hPL analog was considerably more potent than the G120R-hGH analog in inhibiting serum-stimulated growth of BT-474 cells. The inhibition by both analogs was more pronounced in the presence of added Zn2+, consistent with binding to an hPRL-like receptor. However, it is possible that the receptors on BT-474 cells are different from hPRL receptor since they are inhibited more by the hPL antagonist than the hGH antagonist.T-47D cells were more resistant to the inhibition by either antagonist. The greatest inhibition was only 12% that of cells not treated with the antagonists (Fig. 3A). T-47D cells have more hPRL receptors than other cell lines (Table I), and to antagonize their growth would require that the antagonist occupy many more receptors at a time. Previous experiments suggest that only a small portion of the hPRL receptors need to signal to exert a maximal effect (Ashkenazi et al., 1987Ashkenazi A. Cohen R. Gertler A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 210: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar; Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the Kd for binding the prolactin receptor on either Nb2 cells or FDC-P1 cells transfected with the hPRL receptor is about 10 times higher than the EC50 for stimulation of growth by hGH (Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).BT-474 Cells Produce a Transcript for a Soluble Form of the hPRL ReceptorPolyclonal antibodies to the hPRLbp (designated PC4) inhibited hPRL-stimulated growth of FDC-P1 cells transfected with the hPRL receptor (Fig. 4A). Previous studies have shown that the PC4 antibody does not compete with hormone binding to the hPRL receptor (Cunningham et al., 1990Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). It is possible that the antibody interferes with dimerization of the hPRL receptor by reacting at a site where the receptors come together as seen when monoclonal antibody 5 binds to the hGH receptor (Cunningham et al., 1991Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The PC4 antibody inhibits growth of serum-stimulated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4B) and hGH-induced growth of T-47D cells (data not shown). However, the PC4 antibody was ineffective at inhibiting the growth of BT-474 cells even when present at a concentration of 2 μM (Fig. 4C). This compares with the inhibition of BT-474 cells by the G120R-hPL analog, which at 1 μM caused about 40% inhibition. This suggested the possibility that BT-474 cells could produce a variant form of hPRL receptor and thus may not bind the antagonistic antibody to hPRL receptor.Fig. 4Inhibition of the growth of FDC-P1 cells transfected with the hPRL receptor (panel A) or of breast cancer cells MCF-7 (panel B) or BT-474 (panel C) with polyclonal antibodies to the extracellular domain of the hPRL receptor (hPRLbp). In panelA, FDC-P1 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of hPRL alone (○), polyclonal antibodies (PC4) to the hPRLbp alone (●), or PC4 in the presence of 2 nM hPRL (■). MCF-7 cells (panelB) or BT474 cells (panelC) were treated with PC4 (●) or G120R-hPL (■). For panelsB and C, the 100% value represents data from cells treated with assay media alone. DNA synthesis was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To better understand the difference in hormone specificity on BT-474 cells, we screened for cDNAs that were homologous to the hGH and/or hPRL with the receptor using degenerate PCR (Fig. 5). We isolated two different clones. One of these isolated from both T-47D and BT-474 cells was identical to the hPRL receptor previously reported (Boutin et al., 1989Boutin J.M. Edery M. Shirota M. Jolicoeur C. Lesueur L. Ali S. Gould D. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1455-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The second one, isolated from only BT-474 cells, had the transmembrane domain exon deleted and consequently a frameshift after Ser204. This produced a stop codon after two additional residues, Ala205 and Trp206. This novel transcript would code for a soluble extracellular domain of the hPRL receptor (Fig. 5). A similar construct has been generated by recombinant methods and expressed in E. coli (Cunningham et al., 1990Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The protein is soluble and binds hPRL with virtually the same affinity as the full-length receptor (Cunningham et al., 1990Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The cDNA for the extracellular domain transcript represented about 5-10% of the total cDNA coding for the hPRL receptor in BT-474 cells and was not found in the other breast cancer cells we have studied (data not shown). We were able to amplify this transcript from BT-474 cells by PCR with primers that are specific for the alternatively spliced form (data not shown).Fig. 5DNA and deduced protein sequence of an alternatively spliced transcript of the hPRL receptor that codes for the hPRLbp from BT-474 cells. The arrow points to the deleted portion, which includes transmembrane domain in the shadedbox. The degenerate PCR primers I and III (underlined in the sequence) were first used to clone the hPRL receptors, and primers I and II were used to prime the variant specific transcript.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The significance of the transcript for a soluble form of the hPRL receptor has yet to be determined, and further work is required to show that this transcript is translated and expressed. Such a form is reminiscent of the soluble form of hGH receptor (Baumann et al., 1986Baumann G. Stolar M.W. Amburn K. Barsano C.P. DeVries B.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 62: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) thought to be shed by proteolysis of the full-length receptor (Leung et al., 1987Leung D.W. Spencer S.A. Cachianes G. Hammonds G. Colins C. Henzel W.J. Barnard R. Waters M.J. Wood W.I. Nature. 1987; 330: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). There are many other examples of soluble cytokine receptors for which various biological functions have been implicated including extending the circulating half-life of the hormone and antagonizing the action of certain cytokines (for review, see Rose-John and Heinrich, 1994Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The production of the soluble extracellular domain could potentially protect the BT-474 cells from inhibition by the PC4 polyclonal antibody and could explain the reversal in apparent inhibition by the antagonists if it bound more tightly to G120R-hGH than to G120R-hPL.Prospects for Use of hPRL Receptor Antagonists in Breast CancerThese studies survey the possibilities for using hPRL receptor antagonists in breast cancer. In most cases the hPRL receptor present on these four breast cancer cell lines was able to stimulate growth and did so in a dimerization-dependent manner. We find that receptor number as well as the presence or absence of the soluble hPRL receptor can have profound effects on the effectiveness of agonists or antagonists to the receptor. Very high levels of current antagonist were required for substantial inhibition of growth, and this would likely prohibit their clinical use. However, it is possible to increase the affinity of Site 1 in the G120R-hGH analog and make it a more potent antagonist to the hGH receptor (Fuh et al., 1992Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar; Lowman et al., 1991Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Biol.

Such a strategy could be applied here to improve either the hGH or hPL antagonists toward the hPRL receptor. Our finding that BT-474 cells produce a unique transcript coding for the extracellular domain could represent a breast cancer-specific form of the receptor. Although antagonists to the hPRL receptor alone were not dramatically effective at inhibiting the growth for most of these cell lines, perhaps the analogs may be more effective when used in conjuction with other growth inhibitors. In fact we find that the G120R hGH antagonist was more effective at inhibiting the growth of SK-BR3 cells when added in the presence of an inhibitory antibody to the HER-2 receptor than for just the antibody alone (data not shown). Thus, an antagonist to the hPRL receptor may be potentially important in the treatment of this complex disease. INTRODUCTIONBreast cancer affects one in every eight women in the United States and is a significant cause of death (Kelsey and Gammon, 1991Kelsey J.L. Gammon M.D. CA Cancer J. Clin. 1991; 41: 146-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). It has been shown that hPRL1( 1The abbreviations used are: hPRLhuman prolactinhGHhuman growth hormonehPLhuman placental lactogenhPRLbpthe extracellular domain of the hPRL receptorFBSfetal bovine serumPCRpolymerase chain reactionmutants are designated by the wild-type residue (in single-letter code) followed by its position and the mutant residuemultiple mutants are indicated by a series of single mutants separated by slashes.) receptors are present in 40-70% of tumor biopsies (Bonneterre et al., 1990; Murphy et al., 1984Murphy J.L. Murphy L.C. Vrhovesek E. Sutherland R.L. Lazarus L. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 1963-1968PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, many breast cancer cell lines express 2-10 times more hPRL receptors than normal cells (Shiu, 1979Shiu R.P.C. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 4381-4386PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). Lactogenic hormones such as hPRL or hPL that bind specifically to the hPRL receptor can stimulate the growth of human breast cancer cell lines (Shiu and Iwasiow, 1985Shiu R.P.C. Iwasiow B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11307-11313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Manni et al., 1986Manni A. Wright C. Davis G. Glenn J. Joehl R. Feil P. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 1669-1672PubMed Google Scholar; Biswas and Vonderhaar, 1987Biswas R. Vonderhaar B.K. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3509-3514PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is believed that lactogenic hormones may play a role in the growth and development of breast cancer in animal models (Phares, 1986Phares C.K. Anticancer Res. 1986; 6: 845-848PubMed Google Scholar; Platica et al., 1991Platica M. Doody J. Mandeli J.P. Hollander V.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 48: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar; Tornell et al., 1991Tornell J. Rymo L. Isaksson G.P. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the importance of these hormones in the human disease is still unclear. For example, higher circulating levels of lactogenic hormones have been found in breast cancer patients by some investigators (Maddox et al., 1992Maddox P.R. Jones D.L. Mansel R.E. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) but not by others (Love et al., 1991Love R.R. Rose D.R. Surawics T.S. Newcomb P.A. Cancer. 1991; 68: 1401-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Table IhPRL receptors are abundant in various human breast cancer cell linesThe hPRL receptor has been cloned from mammary cancer cells (Boutin et al., 1989Boutin J.M. Edery M. Shirota M. Jolicoeur C. Lesueur L. Ali S. Gould D. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1455-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It contains a single extracellular domain, a transmembrane, and an intracellular domain. Ligand-induced dimerization is believed to be responsible for signaling. Mutational studies have shown that hormones that can activate the receptor contain two binding sites for the receptor, Site 1 and Site 2 (Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; for review, see Wells and De Vos, 1993Wells J.A. De Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 329-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These sites bind in a sequential fashion where the hormone binds first through Site 1 and then Site 2 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies to the PRL receptor can cause weak signaling (Djiane et al., 1985Djiane J. Dusanter-Fourt I. Katoh M. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11430-11435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).A homolog of hGH, hPL, can also activate the hPRL receptor. Unlike hPRL, hPL and hGH require Zn2+ to bind the hPRL receptor via Site 1 (Cunningham et al., 1990Cunningham B.C. Bass S. Fuh G. Wells J.A. Science. 1990; 250: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar; Lowman et al.,1991). The structural basis for this was elaborated in a recent x-ray crystal structure of the complex between hGH and the extracellular domain of the hPRL receptor (Somers et al., 1994Somers W. Ultsch M. De Vos A.M. Kossiakoff A.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Based upon the sequential dimerization mechanism it has been possible to build hPRL receptor antagonists that bind to the receptor via a normal Site 1 but do not allow efficient dimerization because of a mutation introduced into Site 2 (Fuh et al., 1993Fuh G. Colosi P. Wood W.I. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5376-5381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we investigate the mechanism of action of the hPRL receptor on four different human breast cancer cell lines. We find these cells can be stimulated to grow by addition of hGH, and the growth activation pattern fits the sequential dimerization model for the hPRL receptor. Furthermore, antagonists to the hPRL receptor inhibit the growth of these cells. Surprisingly, not all breast cancer cell lines respond equivalently to these antagonists. In particular, one cell line (BT-474) is more potently inhibited by an hPL (not an hGH) antagonist and produced transcripts that coded for a novel form of the extracellular domain of the prolactin receptor. These studies provide further support for the importance of the hPRL receptor in breast cancer and suggest that antagonists to it may help to treat the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2084560871,"We have studied the kinetics and thermodynamics of a virus interacting with its receptor using human rhinovirus serotype 3 (HRV3), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) containing Ig superfamily domains 1-5 (sICAM-1), and surface plasmon resonance. There were two classes of binding sites for sICAM-1 on HRV3, each comprising about 50% of the total sites, with association rate constants of 2450 ± 300 and 134 ± 11 M−1 s−1. These rates are low, consistent with binding to a relatively inaccessible site in the rhinovirus canyon. By contrast, three monoclonal antibodies bound to sICAM-1 with a single rate constant of 17,000-48,000 M−1 s−1. The dissociation rate constant for HRV3 was 1.7 ± 0.1 × 10−3 s−1, giving calculated dissociation constants of 0.7 ± 0.1 and 12.5 ± 1.2 μM. Agreement was good with saturation binding in solution, which showed two sites of similar abundance with KD of 0.55 ± 0.2 and 5.7 ± 2.0 μM. A bivalent chimera of ICAM-1 with the IgA1 Fc region bound with KD= 50 and 410 nM, showing 17-fold enhanced affinity. Lowering pH from 8.0 to 6.0 reduced affinity by approximately 50-fold, primarily by reducing the on rate. Thermodynamic measurements showed that binding of ICAM-1 to HRV3 is endothermic, by contrast to binding to monoclonal antibody. The heat that is absorbed of 3.5 and 6.3 kcal/mol for the two classes of ICAM-1 binding sites may contribute to receptor-mediated disruption of virions, which has an activation energy of about 42 kcal/mol."

The α subunit is the DNA polymerase; the ε subunit is the proofreading 3′-5′-exonuclease; and the β subunit is a dimer in the shape of a ring with a central cavity for encircling duplex DNA. The function of the β ring is to slide freely along duplex DNA while tethering the polymerase machinery to the template for highly processive synthesis (3Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S.

The γ complex, composed of five different subunits (γδδ′χψ), is a molecular matchmaker that couples ATP hydrolysis to load β clamps onto primed DNA.

This series of reports presents five related topics in which the pure subunits are used to assemble the holoenzyme. Studies of the assembly process have outlined the subunit contacts and the overall structure of this replicative machine. This first report of the series focuses on the γ complex. The γ complex has been constituted in quantity from its five separate subunits, revealing several subunit contacts and providing a framework for its overall organization. Compositional studies show that four of the five subunits are present in single copy, which defines the γ complex as a structure lacking a 2-fold axis of symmetry (i.e. it is asymmetric). In the second report, the point of contact between the β clamp and the γ complex is identified as residing nearly completely, if not solely, in the δ subunit (41Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, ATP is needed for the γ complex to “present” the δ subunit for interaction with β, providing insight into the role for ATP and the mechanism of clamp loading. The third report defines the assembly path of the nine-subunit Pol III∗ assembly (38Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Study of Pol III∗ and its subunit composition reveals that contact between γ and τ is the central touch point between the clamp loader (γ complex) and the twin polymerase (Pol III′) within the holoenzyme. Compositional study of Pol III∗ shows that only one copy of some of the subunits is present, and therefore, the holoenzyme must be structurally asymmetric. The first report shows that the single copy subunits can assemble with either γ or τ to form a clamp loader. The fourth report utilizes ATP-binding site mutants of γ and τ to show that in Pol III∗, the single copy subunits of the clamp loader reside on γ (39Xiao H. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13378-13383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The preference of γ over τ appears to be caused by association of core with τ (but not γ), which puts the association of τ with the single copy subunits at a kinetic disadvantage. The last report shows that four different forms of Pol III can be assembled in the presence of primed DNA (42Stukenberg P.T. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13384-13391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These distinct polymerase forms may perform different tasks in DNA metabolism. Radioactive nucleotides were obtained from DuPont NEN, and unlabeled nucleotides were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Proteins were purified as described: α, ε, γ, and τ (33Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); β (4Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar); δ and δ′ (24Dong A. Onrust R. Skangalis M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11758-11765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); χ and ψ (25Xiao H. Crombie R. Dong Z. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11773-11778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and θ (27Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11785-11791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pol III∗ was purified from cell lysates (9Maki H. Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6570-6578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the γ complex was purified from cell lysates (16Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and the αε complex was constituted and purified as described (33Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined from their extinction coefficients at 280 nm, except for Pol III∗ and the γ complex purified without overproduction, which were quantitated using the protein assay from Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as a standard. M13mp18 ssDNA was phenol-extracted from phage that was purified by two consecutive bandings (first down and then up) in cesium chloride gradients as described (43Turner J. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). M13mp18 ssDNA was primed with a DNA 30-mer (map positions 6817-6846) as described (33Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Oligos Etc. Buffer A contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), 20% glycerol, and 5 mM DTT. Replication buffer contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 4% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mM DTT, 8 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM ATP, 60 μM dCTP, 60 μM dGTP, 60 μM dATP, and 20 μM [α-32P]TTP (specific activity of 2000-4000 cpm/pmol). Column buffer contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl. SPR buffer contained 10 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. Sedimentation buffer contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 100 mM NaCl. Replication assays contained 63 ng (32 fmol) of singly primed M13mp18 ssDNA, 0.82 μg of SSB, 8.8 ng (56 fmol) of αε complex, and 20 ng (246 fmol as dimer) of β in a final volume of 25 μl of replication buffer (after the addition of remaining proteins). All proteins were added to the assay on ice and then shifted to 37°C for 5 min. DNA synthesis was quenched and quantitated using DE81 paper as described (34Rowen L. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 758-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When needed, proteins were diluted in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Gel filtration of the reconstituted γ and τ complexes was performed at 4°C (unless indicated otherwise) using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with column buffer containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM ATP. To constitute these complexes, γ (78 μg, 0.88 nmol as dimer) or τ (118 μg, 0.83 nmol as dimer) was incubated with χ (39 μg, 2.4 nmol as monomer) and ψ (30 μg, 2 nmol as monomer) for 30 min at 15°C. To this protein mixture was added δ (77 μg, 2 nmol as monomer) and δ′ (74 μg, 2 nmol as monomer) for 30 min at 15°C. The protein mixture was then concentrated to 100 μl by spin dialysis using a Centricon 30 apparatus (Amicon, Inc.) and gel-filtered. After the first 7 ml, fractions of 200 μl were collected and analyzed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (100 μl/lane) stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Densitometry of stained gels was performed using a Pharmacia Ultrascan XL laser densitometer. Replication assays of column fractions were performed by first diluting a 2-μl aliquot 20-fold and then adding 2 μl to the assay. Gel filtration of mixtures containing less than all five subunits of the γ complex (i.e.Fig. 5) were performed using a Superose 12 column (in one case, Superdex 75 was used as indicated in the legend to Fig. 5). Subunit mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 15°C in 200 μl of column buffer and included (when present) the following: γ, 84 μg (0.9 nmol as dimer); δ, 57 μg (1.5 nmol); δ′, 56 μg (1.56 nmol); χ, 41.8 μg (2.52 nmol); and ψ, 25 μg (1.67 nmol). Subunit mixtures were gel-filtered as described above, except that after collecting the first 6.0 ml, fractions of 170 μl were collected. Additions of ψ in the absence of χ required 0.5 M urea as described (26Xiao H. Dong Z. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11779-11784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To remove urea, mixtures containing both χ and ψ were first mixed using a 1.5-fold excess of χ to ψ in a final concentration of 0.5 M urea in buffer A and then dialyzed against sedimentation buffer. Protein standards (Bio-Rad and Sigma) were a mixture of 50 μg each in 100 μl of column buffer. The Kav value was calculated using the following equation: Kav = (Ve- V0)/(V0- V0), where Ve is the observed elution volume, V0 is the included volume, and V0 is the exclusion volume. The V0 value for both Superose 6 and 12 columns was 24 ml (manufacturer's specifications), and the V0 value, determined using M13mp18 ssDNA saturated with SSB (total molecular mass of ≈25 MDa), was 6.0 ml for Superose 12 and 7.0 ml for Superose 6. The γδδ′χψ and τδδ′χψ complexes were constituted as described above for gel filtration analysis and then layered onto separate 11.6-ml 10-30% glycerol gradients in sedimentation buffer. Protein standards (50 μg each in 100 μl of sedimentation buffer) were layered onto a parallel gradient, and the gradients were centrifuged at 270,000 × g for 30 h at 4°C. Fractions of 170 μl were collected from the bottom of the tube and analyzed on a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (100 μl/lane) stained with Coomassie Blue and analyzed in replication assays as described for the gel filtration column fractions. Stability of the γ[3H]χψ Complex-The χ and ψ subunits were tritiated by reductive methylation as described (3Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) to specific activities of 7.5 × 104 and 1.4 × 104 cpm/pmol, respectively. The γ[3H]χψ complex was constituted upon mixing 4 mg of γ with 0.125 mg of [3H]χ, 2.7 mg of unlabeled χ, 0.25 mg of [3H]ψ, and 1.7 mg of unlabeled ψ in a final volume of 3.0 ml of buffer A (0.5 M urea final concentration due to the urea in ψ). After 1 h at 15°C, the mixture was applied to a 1-ml Mono Q column and eluted with a 19-ml linear gradient of 0-0.4 M NaCl in buffer A. The γ[3H]χψ complex was the last to elute (0.22 M NaCl). Fractions containing γ[3H]χψ were pooled (3.1 mg; specific activity of 1.8 × 103 cpm/pmol), dialyzed against 4 liters of buffer A, and then aliquoted and stored at −70°C. Dissociation of the γ[3H]χψ complex was assayed by gel filtration on Superose 12, which resolves γ[3H]χψ from dissociated [3H]χψ. A total of 8.9 μg (71 pmol) of γ[3H]χψ complex was incubated for 5 min at the indicated temperature in either the absence or presence of 5.5 μg (141 pmol) of δ and 5.25 μg (140 pmol) of δ′ in 100 μl of column buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl, 0.5 mM ATP, and 8 mM MgCl2. After incubation, reactions were analyzed by gel filtration on Superose 12 essentially as described above, except that the column buffer contained 300 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM ATP. The amount of [3H]χψ in each column fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Different temperatures of gel filtration were achieved by immersing the column and the injection loop in a water bath containing ice or held at 28 or 37°C. A mixture of 11.1 mg of γ (118 nmol as dimer), 13.7 mg of δ (355 nmol as monomer), 8.7 mg of δ′ (235 nmol as monomer), 5.9 mg of χ (354 nmol as monomer), and 3.6 mg of ψ (237 nmol as monomer in 4 M urea) was incubated in a final volume of 63.75 ml of buffer A for 30 min at 15°C (incubation was started with χ and ψ proteins combined together in a final volume sufficient to bring the urea concentration to 0.5 M, and then the other subunits were added). This mixture was loaded onto an 8-ml Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and eluted with a 180-ml linear gradient of 0-0.4 M NaCl in buffer A at 0.3 ml/min. Fractions of 2.5 ml each were collected. Fractions 46-52, which contained γδδ′χψ, were pooled (18.5 ml, 18 mg), dialyzed against 4 liters of buffer A, and then aliquoted and stored at −70°C. Reversed-phase HPLC analysis was performed on a Waters system. The reconstituted γ complex (30 μg) in 100 μl of buffer A was adjusted to 1% trifluoroacetic acid and injected onto a Dynamax C4 (butyl) reversed-phase HPLC column (250 × 4.6 mm) with a pore size of 300 Å equilibrated with 40% HPLC-grade acetonitrile (J. T. Baker Inc.) in 0.125% trifluoroacetic acid. Subunits were eluted with a 48-55% acetonitrile gradient in 0.125% trifluoroacetic acid over 3 min followed by a 55-100% acetonitrile gradient in 0.125% trifluoroacetic acid over 12 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution of subunits was monitored at 280 nm and recorded on chart paper. The areas under the peaks were measured manually by cutting the peaks out and weighing them. The molar extinction coefficients of the subunits calculated from their amino acid sequences are as follows: γ, 20,340 M−1 cm−1; δ, 46,130 M−1 cm−1; δ′, 60,136 M−1 cm−1; χ, 29,160 M−1 cm−1; and ψ, 24,040 M−1 cm−1). The recoveries of γ complex subunits from the HPLC column were determined by passing a mixture of the subunits of known concentration (measured by their absorbance at 280 nm and known extinction coefficient) over the same HPLC column. The total absorbance recovered for each subunit was as follows: γ, 75.6%; δ, 87.3%; δ′, 100.4%; χ, 90.6%; and ψ, 79.1%. Hence, all the subunits were recovered from the HPLC column in a reasonably high yield. These recoveries were not used to correct the observed molar ratio of subunits in the γ complex as the recovery measurements have an error of their own. Immobilization of subunits was performed on the carboxymethyldextran matrix-coated sensor chip CM5 by carbodiimide covalent linkage following the manufacturers' instructions (Pharmacia Biosensor AB) using 30-μl solutions of subunits in SPR buffer in 10 mM sodium acetate at the following subunit concentrations and pH values: δ, 1.24 μM and pH 5.5; δ′, 0.35 μM and pH 5.5; and χ, 1.13 μM and pH 4.5. To immobilize the χψ complex, the χ subunit was immobilized, and then a 35-μl solution of ψ (0.5 μM in SPR buffer containing 0.5 M urea) was passed over the chip for 3 min, followed by washing with SPR buffer (28% of immobilized χ became complexed with ψ). The final change in response units for each immobilization was as follows: δ, 3542 response units; δ′, 3562 response units; χ, 2963 response units; and χψ, 3683 response units (2936 response units of χ plus 747 response units after adding ψ). SPR analysis was performed by injecting 30 μl of a 1 μM solution of the indicated protein (as monomer, except for γ and τ, which are expressed as dimers) in SPR buffer for 3 min at 25°C. All proteins were dialyzed against SPR buffer to reduce buffer-related artifacts. To obtain a value for the koff, injections were followed for 3 min by SPR buffer lacking protein. After completing each analysis, the surface of the chip was regenerated by injecting 10 μl of 0.1 M glycine (pH 9.5), which released remaining bound protein without decreasing the capacity of the immobilized protein to bind in future injections. When the χψ complex was immobilized, regeneration was performed by consecutive injection of 30 μl of 6 M urea and 30 μl of 2 M urea in SPR buffer, followed by de novo binding of ψ to χ as described above. Data are presented as the observed change in response units divided by the molecular mass of the subunit in the mobile phase (δ, δ′, and χ as monomer; γ and τ as dimer; core as α1ε1θ1; χψ as χ1ψ1; and δδ′ as δ1δ′1). All apparent kon and koff values were determined through nonlinear curve fitting using the Pharmacia Biosensor kinetics software (BIAevaluation 2.0) assuming the simplest case: A + B → AB. To determine if the γ complex (γδδ′χψ) can be reconstituted from purified overproduced subunits, γ was mixed with a 2-fold molar excess each of δ, δ′, χ, and ψ and then gel-filtered (Fig. 1). A complex of γδδ′χψ formed as indicated by comigration of all five subunits (Fig. 1A, panel 1, fractions 21-25); excess proteins eluted later as the δδ′ complex (fractions 40-49) and the χψ complex (fractions 46-49). Column fractions containing the γδδ′χψ complex were active in assembly of the β clamp onto primed DNA, leading to processive DNA synthesis by the polymerase (Fig. 1A, panel3). Comparison with protein standards showed that the γ complex has a Stokes radius of 67 Å (Fig. 1A, panel4), close to the 61-Å radius determined for the γ complex purified from E. coli lysates (25Xiao H. Crombie R. Dong Z. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11773-11778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The constituted γ complex sedimented in a glycerol gradient with an s value of 8.7 S (Fig. 1B, panels1, 3, and 4), similar to the value of 8.2 S for the γ complex purified from E. coli lysates (16Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trailing of the γ complex in the sedimentation analysis indicates that some dissociation occurs during the 30-h procedure. Hence, the s value should be taken as a minimum estimate. Combining the Stokes radius and the s value in the mass equation of Siegel and Monty (35Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar) yields a minimum estimated mass of 256 kDa for the reconstituted γ complex (Table I), similar to the value of 210 kDa for the γ complex purified from E. coli(16Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table INative mass of γδδ′χψ and τδδ′χψ For structural studies to be described below, the γ complex was prepared in quantity and purified away from excess subunits that were not bound in the complex. Preparation of the γ complex is shown in Fig. 2, in which the subunits were mixed using limiting γ, followed by chromatography on a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q column eluted with an NaCl gradient. The γ complex was tightly retained on the column and was the last to elute. This method is highly efficient as the 11 mg of γ present initially was recovered as 18 mg of γ complex for an overall yield of 79%. Two techniques were applied to determine the molar ratio of subunits within the γ complex. The simplest was to scan the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels of the γ complex that was either constituted from pure subunits or purified as a complex from E. coli lysates. The molar ratio of γ complex subunits from this analysis is presented in Table II after correcting the areas under the peaks for the relative molecular mass of each subunit and normalizing to the δ′ subunit. The results suggest a molar ratio of γ2δ1δ′1χ1ψ1, similar to the conclusions of an earlier study using the γ complex purified from cell lysates (16Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6555-6560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Different proteins may take up different amounts of Coomassie Blue dye, and therefore, we used as standards individual subunits of known concentration determined by absorbance from their extinction coefficients at 280 nm.Table IIMolar ratio of subunits in the γ and τ complexes The molar ratio of γ complex subunits was also determined by an HPLC approach. The pure constituted γ complex was treated with 1% trifluoroacetic acid to dispers"

The proximal mediators involved in the activation of the PRL-activated Raf-1 cascade in T-cells, however, remain poorly characterized. The role of one proximal signaling protein, namely p95vav, during PRLr signal transduction was examined in the Nb2 T-cell line. The novel results obtained here indicate that Vav is transiently associated with the PRLr and is necessary for PRL-stimulated proliferation. During PRL stimulation, a rapid and dramatic increase in guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity was found to be associated with Vav immunoprecipitates. Concomitantly, an increase in Vav phosphorylation on serine-threonine residues was observed. The Vav-associated GEF activation could be inhibited by staurosporine and calphostin, but not herbimycin, suggesting a modulatory role for phosphorylation at serine-threonine residues. Treatment of Nb2 cells with antisense Vav oligonucleotide ablated Vav expression and blocked PRL-driven proliferation, but failed to inhibit PRL-induced GEF activation within Nb2 lysates. These data indicate that GEF activity may not be intrinsic to Vav as has been previously suggested, but either resides in or is complemented by an associated GEF. Subsequent to the transient activation of associated GEF activity, Vav was found to translocate into the Nb2 cell nucleus. Thus, Vav may utilize two independent mechanisms in T-cells, namely the activation of an associated GEF and direct nuclear internalization, to mediate PRLr signaling.

MARCKS is myristoylated at its amino terminus; this modification is thought to play the major role in anchoring MARCKS to cellular membranes. Recent studies have suggested that the protein's basic phosphorylation site/calmodulin binding domain may also be involved in the membrane association of MARCKS through electrostatic interactions. The present studies used mutations in the primary structure of the protein to investigate the nature of the association between MARCKS and cell membranes. In chick embryo fibroblasts, activation of protein kinase C led to a decrease in MARCKS membrane association as determined by cell fractionation techniques. Cell-free assays revealed that nonmyristoylated MARCKS exhibited almost no affinity for fibroblast membranes, despite readily demonstrable binding of the wild-type protein. Similar experiments in which the four serines in the phosphorylation site domain were mutated to aspartic acids, mimicking phosphorylation, decreased, but did not eliminate, membrane binding when compared to either the wild-type protein or a comparable tetra-asparagine mutant. Addition of calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ also inhibited binding of the wild-type protein to membranes, presumably by neutralizing the phosphorylation site domain, or by physically interfering with its membrane association. Surprisingly, expression of a nonmyristoylatable mutant form of MARCKS in intact cells led to only a 46% decrease in its plasma membrane association, as determined by cell fractionation and immunoelectron microscopy. These results are consistent with a complex model of the interaction of MARCKS with cellular membranes, in which the myristoyl moiety, the positively charged phosphorylation site domain, and possibly other domains make independent contributions to membrane binding in intact cells.

https://openalex.org/W2051981166,"The effects of ceramide analogs on the uptake of markers for fluid-phase (horseradish peroxidase, HRP) and receptor-mediated (low density lipoprotein, LDL) endocytosis were studied in Chinese hamster fibroblasts. N-Hexanoyl-D-erythro-sphingosine (C6-Cer) decreased the uptake of HRP in a dose-dependent manner. Internalization was inhibited >40% with 25 μM C6-Cer, relative to controls, and was apparent within 5 min. Internalization of HRP was also inhibited by other Cer analogs and by treatment with agents that raise levels of endogenous Cer (sphingomyelinase or the glycosphingolipid synthesis inhibitor, 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP)), but not by N-hexanoyl-D-erythro-sphinganine (C6-dihydro-Cer) or sphingosine. Internal-ization of LDL was also inhibited by C6-Cer in a concentration-dependent manner, but was less pronounced than the effect on HRP internalization (10% versus 40% inhibition with 25 μM C6-Cer), suggesting that ceramide might affect fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis to different extents. C6-Cer also slowed HRP and LDL transport from endosomes to lysosomes as studied by analysis of endocytic vesicles on Percoll density gradients and induced a redistribution of endocytic organelles as determined by fluorescence microscopy of intact cells using appropriate markers. This resulted in decreased degradation of 125I-labeled LDL in the presence of C6-Cer. These results suggest that endogenous ceramide may modulate endocytosis.

Internalization of HRP was also inhibited by other Cer analogs and by treatment with agents that raise levels of endogenous Cer (sphingomyelinase or the glycosphingolipid synthesis inhibitor, 1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP)), but not by N-hexanoyl-D-erythro-sphinganine (C6-dihydro-Cer) or sphingosine. Internal-ization of LDL was also inhibited by C6-Cer in a concentration-dependent manner, but was less pronounced than the effect on HRP internalization (10% versus 40% inhibition with 25 μM C6-Cer), suggesting that ceramide might affect fluid-phase and receptor-mediated endocytosis to different extents. C6-Cer also slowed HRP and LDL transport from endosomes to lysosomes as studied by analysis of endocytic vesicles on Percoll density gradients and induced a redistribution of endocytic organelles as determined by fluorescence microscopy of intact cells using appropriate markers. This resulted in decreased degradation of 125I-labeled LDL in the presence of C6-Cer. These results suggest that endogenous ceramide may modulate endocytosis."

Insulin increases glucose transport via a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway in BC3H-1 myocytes, but the function of specific PKC isozymes in insulin action has not been elucidated. Two isoforms of PKCβ result via alternative splicing of precursor mRNA. As now shown, both isoforms are present in BC3H-1 myocytes, and insulin induces alternative splicing of the PKCβ mRNA thereby switching expression from PKCβI to PKCβII mRNA. This effect occurs rapidly (15 min after insulin treatment) and is dose-dependent. The switch in mRNA is reflected by increases in the protein levels of PKCβII. High levels of 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which are commonly used to deplete or down-regulate PKC in cells, also induce the switch to PKCβII mRNA following overnight treatment, and protein levels of PKCβII reflected mRNA increases. To investigate the functional importance of the shift in PKCβ isoform expression, stable transfectants of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts overexpressing PKCβI and PKCβII were established. The overexpression of PKCβII but not PKCβI in NIH-3T3 cells significantly enhanced insulin effects on glucose transport. This suggests that PKCβII may be more selective than PKCβI for enhancing the glucose transport effects of insulin in at least certain cells and, furthermore, that insulin can regulate the expression of PKCβII by alternative mRNA splicing.

Molecular cloning has revealed that PKC represents a multigene family, to date consisting of 11 different isozymes encoded by 10 distinct genes. Depending on the cofactor requirements, PKCs can be subdivided into three groups: classical PKCs (α, βI, βII, γ), which require diacylglycerol, phospholipids, and Ca2+ for full activity; novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, θ), which are phospholipid and diacylglycerol-dependent but Ca2+-independent; and atypical PKCs (ζ, (ι)λ, μ), which require only phospholipids (for review, see Refs. 1Stabel S.

The resulting polypeptides, PKCβI and PKCβII, diverge in the sequence of their C-terminal 50 or 52 amino acids, respectively (11Ono Y. Kurokawa T. Fujii T. Kawahara K. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K.

In these cases, alternative splicing patterns are influenced by stages of development, differentiation, growth factors, or disease. The functional significance of alternatively spliced peptides is not fully understood.

Immunochemical methods with specific PKCβI, -βII, and pan-specific antibodies demonstrate that both isoforms are present in these cells and tissues as well as in rat soleus muscle, rat adipocytes, and BC3H-1 murine myocytes (6Standaert M.L. Cooper D.R. Hernandez H. Arnold T.P. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Ishizuka T. Cooper D.R. Hernandez H. Farese R.V.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 3345-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These studies did not, however, evaluate whether expression is regulated in vitro and in vivo. We found that the levels of mRNA for PKCβI declined quickly with insulin treatment, and PKCβII mRNA levels increased, concomitantly, along with protein levels of PKCβII in BC3H-1 myocytes. High levels of TPA mimicked insulin, and PKCβII was the major isoform of PKCβ retained in BC3H-1 myocytes following chronic TPA treatment. To determine if PKCβI and -βII function differently in response to insulin, both were stably overexpressed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, which normally express PKCα and only negligible levels of PKCβ. PKCβII overexpression enhanced insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake significantly above empty vector control cells or stable transfectants overexpressing PKCβI. Thus, one alternatively spliced form may be more specific than the other for increasing glucose transport responses in certain cell types. BC3H-1 myocytes were grown in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% controlled process serum replacement (Sigma) for 11-14 days on collagen-coated 100-mm plates. Glucose (25 mM) was added to culture media for 24-48 h prior to treatment with varying concentrations of insulin or TPA (Sigma) as indicated prior to isolation of total RNA or cell lysates. Total cellular RNA was obtained using a single-step method (20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). For determining mRNA half-life, cells were treated with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml, Sigma) alone or actinomycin D and insulin. For RPA, the PstI fragment of PKCβI (BIV5) was subcloned into pGEM-4Z (Fig. 1). Based on predicted splice events (16Blobe G.C. Khan W.A. Halpern A.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10627-10635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PKCβI-specific transcripts yield a 716-base pair protected band, while PKCβII encoded mRNA is detected as a 566-base pair band. Antisense PKCβI was transcribed with T7 polymerase and labeled with [α-32P]UTP using the Promega RNA transcription kit. Total RNA (10 μg) was hybridized with the 32P-labeled BIV5 cRNA probe (1.2-5 × 105 cpm/hybridization) using the RPA II ribonuclease protection assay kit as described (Ambion). Protected RNA fragments were detected following electrophoresis on denaturing polyacrylamide gel (5% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea). The sizes of the probe and protected fragments were verified by 5′-labeled ϕX174 DNA/HinfI ladder. Hybridized fragments were detected by autoradiography. Generation of single-stranded cDNA templates for RT-PCR was carried out on BC3H-1 myocyte total RNA using SuperScript preamplification kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA was aliquoted, and three reactions were amplified: (a) sense primers corresponding to the V3 region of PKCβ (ATGAAACTGACCGATTTTAACTTCCTG) and antisense primers corresponding to the V5 region of PKCβI (AAGAGTTTGTCAGTGGGAGTCAGTTCC), (b) sense primers to V3 region and antisense primers corresponding to the V5 region of PKCβII (CGGAGGTCTACAGATCTACTTAGCTCT), and (c) sense and antisense primers for β-actin (Clontech). For all primer pairs, cycling conditions were an initial 96°C melt, 5 min, and then 95°C, 1 min; 58°C, 1 min; 72°C, 3 min. This cycle was repeated 34 times ending with 95°C, 1 min; 58°C, 1 min; and 72°C, 10 min. Specificity of the primers was verified with cDNA for PKCβI and PKCβII (from Dr. John Knopf, Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA). Cell lysates (50 μg) from BC3H-1 myocytes and NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing PKCβI and βII were analyzed as described previously (21Cooper D.R. Khalakdina A. Watson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Miranda P.V. Brandelli A. Tezon J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PKCβI antibodies were obtained from Research and Diagnostic Antibodies, from Drs. Susan Jaken and Susan Kiley (W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Lake Placid, NY), or from Dr. Yusaf Hannun (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). PKCβII antibodies were provided by Dr. D. Kirk Ways (East Carolina University, Greenville, NC) or Drs. Jaken and Kiley. Following incubation with primary antibody, blots were developed as described previously (23Acevedo-Duncan M. Cooper D.R. Standaert M.L. Farese R.V. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 174-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or with the ECL kit (Amersham Corp.). The PKC antisera were characterized previously (16Blobe G.C.

Cell Res. 1994; 210: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Specificity of PKCβII antisera obtained from Dr. D. Kirk Ways for PKCβII in BC3H-1 myocytes was performed by preabsorption of antisera with peptides. NIH-3T3 cells were stably transfected as described with MTHβII (24Mischak H. Peirce J.H. Goodnight J.

Murphy Kirschmeier P. Weinstein I.B. Cell. 1988; 52: 853-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 750 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the more than 100 clones obtained were cultured in bulk cultures. In the case of PKCβII, data from one stable clone is also shown with the stable bulk transfected cells. Stable transfectants are grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Overexpression was evaluated by Western blot analysis and by PKC activity toward histone III-S (Sigma) as described previously (21Cooper D.R. Khalakdina A. Watson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 2-[1,2-3H]Deoxy-D-glucose uptake-NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing PKCβI and -βII were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) in 24-well plates until >80% confluent. Prior to 2-[3H]DOG uptake, cells are switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum overnight. 2-[3H]DOG uptake is assayed as described previously (21Cooper D.R. Khalakdina A. Watson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 2-Deoxyglucose uptake refers to transport across the plasma membrane operating in tandem with phosphorylation by hexokinase. To simultaneously examine PKCβI and -βII mRNA in BC3H-1 myocytes, we used a cRNA probe spanning the alternative splice site for PKCβI and -βII for RPA (Fig. 1). When BC3H-1 myocytes were treated overnight with increasing concentrations of insulin, cellular expression switched PKCβ mRNA from the PKCβI to PKCβII mRNA as demonstrated by the appearance of the shorter, 566-base pair, protected fragment (Fig. 2A). This suggested that insulin regulated alternative splicing of PKCβ mRNA. This phenomenon was dose-dependent and was apparent at 0.2 nM insulin. Initially, PKCβI was the primary mRNA detected by this assay. In the presence of insulin, PKCβII mRNA became the primary splice product. A time course showed that the PKCβI to PKCβII mRNA shift was complete after 15 min (Fig. 2B). To establish that insulin regulated the expression of PKCβI and -βII mRNA using another method, the alternative splice products were examined by RT-PCR (Fig. 1). This assay allows for the relative evaluation of PKCβI and -βII mRNA, but it is not quantitative. The amplification spans several splice sites in mature PKCβ mRNA and eliminates amplification of any precursor mRNA forms. As observed with the RPA, the switch from PKCβI to PKCβII mRNA was complete after 15 min following insulin treatment (Fig. 3). With this assay, both PKCβI and -βII mRNA were detected in unstimulated BC3H-1 myocytes, but only minor traces of PKCβI mRNA could be detected in cells that had been incubated with insulin for up to 60 min. The rapid disappearance of the PKCβI mRNA in the presence of insulin suggests that another event accompanying the switch to PKCβII mRNA is the destabilization of PKCβI mRNA. To evaluate this, cells were treated with actinomycin D alone or with insulin for varying times. In the presence of insulin, PKCβI mRNA was decreased by 75% after 15 min, demonstrating that the effect of insulin on PKCβI mRNA was to destabilize the message (Fig. 4). In the absence of insulin, PKCβI message was only detected for up to 1 h in cells treated with actinomycin D. This indicates that message stability may play some role in regulating differential expression of PKCβI mRNA. To determine whether the activation and subsequent down-regulation of PKC was involved in PKCβ alternative splicing, PKC was directly activated with TPA. Under these conditions, we have shown that BC3H-1 myocytes appear to retain PKCβ immunoreactive material (7Cooper D.R. Watson J.E. Acevedo-Duncan M. Pollet R.J. Standaert M.L. Farese R.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Cooper D.R. Galaretta C.M.d. Fanjul L.F. Mojsilovic L. Standaert M.L. Pollet R.J. Farese R.J. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). TPA treatment increased PKCβI mRNA levels by 50% at lower concentrations, which is not surprising, as TPA induces the basal promoter of PKCβ (26Obeid L.M. Blobe G.C. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20804-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, at higher concentrations of TPA, 1-5 μM, alternative splicing of PKCβI to PKCβII was induced (Fig. 5). To determine whether the shift from PKCβI to PKCβII mRNA following insulin treatment was reflected at the protein level, lysates from insulin-treated BC3H-1 myocytes were analyzed. Very low levels of PKCβII protein (a single 82 kDa band) were detected in untreated cells, but levels increased more than 5-fold after 30 min of treatment and more than 12-fold following 24 h of insulin treatment (Fig. 6). The induction of PKCβII by insulin was apparent using antibodies from Drs. Jaken and Kiley and Dr. Ways. PKCβI, the predominant PKCβ mRNA and protein form in resting BC3H-1 myocytes, diminished to half of its initial level with insulin treatment. PKCβI was detected as a doublet at 74-76 kDa and sometimes as another doublet at 80-82 kDa in whole cell lysates with antibodies from Drs. Jaken and Kiley and Dr. Hannun, Life Technologies, Inc. (affinity purified), and Research and Diagnostic Antibodies. A PKCβII immunoreactive band (at 80-82 kDa) was demonstrated in BC3H-1 myocytes following overnight treatment with 5 μM TPA with antisera from Dr. Ways (Fig. 7) and Drs. Jaken and Kiley (data not shown). PKCβI levels (at 74-76 kDa) were diminished by more than 80% following TPA treatment as detected with antibody from Life Technologies, Inc. that recognizes the (V3) region.2( 2Antibody from Life Technologies, Inc. detected only lower molecular mass forms of PKCβ, presumably PKCβI, when blots were developed and visualized using alkaline phosphatase. This antibody detected higher molecular mass forms of PKCβII as well as lower molecular mass PKCβI when Amersham ECL was used for visualization.) The greater relative diminution of PKCβI following treatment with TPA versus insulin may reflect the ability of TPA to activate PKCβI while insulin may preferentially stimulate PKCβII under these conditions, and insulin may not enhance the proteolytic turnover of PKCβI to the same extent as TPA. Thus, the switch from PKCβI to PKCβII mRNA is paralleled by the increased expression of PKCβII.Fig. 7Effect of phorbol esters on PKCβI and PKCβII protein expression in BC3H-1 myocytes. BC3H-1 myocytes were treated with vehicle (A) or 5 μM TPA (B) overnight. Cytosolic (75 and 60 μg of protein for PKCβI and PKCβII, respectively) and membrane (150 and 40 μg of protein for PKCβI and PKCβII, respectively) fractions were prepared for Western blot analysis using alkaline phosphatase detection as described previously (21Cooper D.R. Khalakdina A. Watson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Antibody against PKCβ hinge region (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used here to detect PKCβI as the lower, 74 kDa, band. (This antibody does not detect PKCβII unless chemiluminesence is used for detection.) PKCβII antibody was from Dr. D. Kirk Ways. Similar decreases in PKCβI and increases in the upper PKCβII band were detectable using the Life Technologies, Inc. PKCβ antibody with ECL detection. The 80 kDa marker is indicated by ●.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The increase in PKCβII protein with insulin occurs rapidly, and its induction may play an important role in glucose transport. The functional significance of this finding is difficult to address in the BC3H-1 myocytes due to the expression of PKCβ and other PKC isoforms (6Standaert M.L. Cooper D.R. Hernandez H. Arnold T.P. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There is also the potential for counter-regulation of these PKC isoforms and glucose transporter levels with insulin. We found that the insulin effect on glucose uptake was enhanced in TPA-treated BC3H-1 myocytes even though acute TPA stimulatory effects were no longer observed. For example, we found 789 ± 20 cpm of 2-[3H]DOG uptake/well for basal uptake versus 1749 ± 35 cpm for insulin (200 nM), and, following 1 μM TPA treatment overnight, we found 1161 ± 69 cpm for basal versus 3609 ± 139 cpm for insulin-treated cells. The observation that PKCβ is an insulin responsive PKC isozyme infers that the switch from PKCβI to PKCβII expression induced by insulin or high concentrations of phorbol ester may be of functional significance for glucose uptake. If PKCβII protein expression reflects an increase in the alternative expression of PKCβII mRNA, one might predict that insulin-stimulated glucose transport will be increased when PKCβII is increased. Although we found that insulin effects on glucose uptake were retained and enhanced by chronic TPA treatment, it was also evident that another PKC isozyme, PKCα, was down-regulated in myocytes (6Standaert M.L. Cooper D.R. Hernandez H. Arnold T.P. Farese R.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 7Cooper D.R. Watson J.E. Acevedo-Duncan M. Pollet R.J. Standaert M.L. Farese R.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To avoid the effects of down-regulating PKCα and other isozymes in BC3H-1 myocytes, we used NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing PKCβI and PKCβII to examine the effects of increased PKCβII. PKCα and negligible amounts of PKCβ are expressed in parent NIH-3T3 cells used here (27Mischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus allowing us to assess the role of PKCβ isoforms without encountering significant endogenous PKCβ as detected in BC3H-1 myocytes. Western blot analysis of transfected NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated the stable overexpression of PKCβI and PKCβII (Fig. 8). PKC activity as determined with histone III-S as substrate was increased 2-fold in cytosol and 3-4-fold in membranes compared with empty vector control cell lines for both isozymes. We previously found in adipocytes and BC3H-1 myocytes that PKCβ contributes to insulin-stimulated glucose transport (28Cooper D.R. Watson J.E. Hernandez H. Yu B. Standaert M.L. Ways D.K. Arnold T.T. Ishizuka T. Farese R.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Farese R.V. Standaert M.L. Ishizuka T. Yu B. Hernandez H. Waldron C. Watson J. Farese J.P. Cooper D.R. Wickstrom E. Antisense Res. Dev. 1991; 1: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In NIH-3T3 cells, we found that 1 and 10 nM insulin increases glucose uptake by 10 and 30%, respectively, in parental or control cells (Table I). This effect of insulin is statistically significant and may reflect a “PKCα component” of glucose transport in NIH-3T3 cells. Cells overexpressing PKCβI did not respond differently than control cells in that insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake remained at 10 and 30% above basal uptake. Cells overexpressing PKCβII demonstrated enhanced, dose-dependent (1-10 nM), insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake of 60 and 100%, respectively, above basal uptake. This enhanced response was also observed in the clonal line overexpressing PKCβII as well as in stable bulk cultures of PKCβII transfectants. The insulin effect is PKC-dependent as indicated by inhibition of 2-DOG uptake with GF 109203X (Calbiochem) and CGP 41251 (Ciba Giegy), specific PKC inhibitors (30Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H.

Cancer. 1989; 43: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). These results indicate that PKCβII but not PKCβI is capable of further enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose transport in NIH-3T3 cells and further suggests a physiological significance in the regulation of PKCβ alternative splicing.Table IEffect of insulin on 2-deoxyglucose uptake in NIH-3T3 cells stably transfected to overexpress PKCβI and PKCβII To our knowledge, this is the first report of a peptide hormone regulating alternative splicing of mRNA within minutes. Furthermore, the protein product of the alternatively spliced mRNA turns out to be a relevant intracellular signaling component for the hormone, insulin. This data sheds new light on the details of insulin signaling as well as PKC isozyme function. The alternatively spliced PKCβ exon detected here corresponds to the C-terminal variable region, V5, which is believed to determine substrate specificity (1Stabel S. Parker P.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The regulation of alternative splicing involves a switch in mRNA processing (11Ono Y. Kurokawa T. Fujii T. Kawahara K. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Nishizuka Y. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrated a change in alternatively spliced products using a probe that overlaps the C4 or catalytic region and the alternative splice site. By selecting a region of PKC spanning the area of the mRNA, which is alternatively spliced, both PKCβI and PKCβII mRNA are detected in the same sample following RNase digestion. Probes directed solely to the V5 region or downstream untranslated region can hybridize with precursor PKCβI mRNA in addition to alternatively spliced mRNA, and the detection of a splicing event is not obvious. We further supported our observation by amplifying mRNA by RT-PCR. The ability to detect PKCβII mRNA in untreated cells using RT-PCR is attributed to the superior sensitivity of the RT-PCR method to amplify low message levels. Using both methods, we found that PKCβI mRNA levels quickly diminish with insulin treatment and, in contrast, PKCβII mRNA levels increase. One explanation for the decrease in PKCβI mRNA may be that insulin diminishes message stability. Although this was found to be the case in experiments where cells were treated with actinomycin D, message destabilization does not explain why PKCβII mRNA levels are then increased, and it is clear that alternative splicing to the default product, PKCβII, is occurring. One scheme of alternative splicing for PKCβ is that retention of the PKCβII exon results in PKCβII mRNA. When this exon is excised, PKCβI is encoded, and the PKCβI polyadenylation site was used by both PKCβI and PKCβII transcripts (11Ono Y. Kurokawa T. Fujii T. Kawahara K. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Nishizuka Y. FEBS Lett. 1986; 206: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). A likely role for insulin might involve regulation of splicing factors required for the mRNA splicing complex, and the factors involved in alternative pre-mRNA splicing are possibly induced by insulin (32Maniatis T. Science. 1991; 251: 33-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). One such factor was isolated from regenerating liver (33Diamond R.H. Du K. Lee V.M. Mohn K.L. Haber B.A. Tewari D.S. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15185-15192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is of interest that insulin regulates alternative splicing of insulin receptor isoforms in hepatic FAO cells similar to the time course we see in the BC3H-1 myocyte for PKCβ splicing (34Sell S.M. Reese D. Ossowski V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30769-30772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in alternative splicing of the insulin receptor is also reported in a diabetic patient (14Norgen S. Zierath J. Wedell A. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Luthman H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies further demonstrate the expression of PKCβI and PKCβII by BC3H-1 myocytes. Using two techniques for detecting mRNA and six different antibodies, we found mRNA and protein PKCβ levels are regulated by insulin and phorbol ester. Recent studies from other labs failed to detect PKCβI or PKCβII in BC3H-1 myocytes (35Stumpo D.J. Haupt D.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21184-21190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, as will be reported later, PKCβI was not only fully down-regulated by overnight TPA treatment, but it was acutely translocated by TPA (as well as by insulin). The failure of Stumpo et al.(35Stumpo D.J. Haupt D.M. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21184-21190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to detect PKCβI in untreated BC3H-1 myocytes may be due to differences in antisera, detection techniques or cell culture. The chemiluminesence method used here may be more sensitive for detecting PKCβI. In our studies, PKCβI appears at a lower apparent molecular mass, 74-76 kDa, than PKCβII, which migrates at 80-82 kDa. PKCβI and βII isoforms were often detected as doublets. The difference in apparent molecular masses between the two isozymes may reflect a number of cellular phosphorylations that PKC may undergo in the processing of newly translated protein or limited proteolysis of PKCβI as suggested (36Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, we frequently change our culture stocks, and cells are serum-starved prior to experiments. Our PKCβ protein analyses of myocyte lysates are similar to studies with IM-9 and BJA-B cell lines, in which PKCβII migrated as an upper 77 kDa and lower 74 kDa band (16Blobe G.C. Khan W.A. Halpern A.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10627-10635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC βI migrated at a lower molecular mass in that study. The upper band did not down-regulate with long term phorbol ester treatment (16Blobe G.C. Khan W.A. Halpern A.E. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10627-10635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies, a similar upper band was induced with TPA and insulin in BC3H-1 myocytes and is consistent with a switch from PKCβI to PKCβII. In these studies it was not possible to compare the amounts of PKCβI with PKCβII. However, the relative changes in PKCβI and PKCβII with insulin and phorbol ester reflect changes related to mRNA levels. In our studies, we are able to demonstrate that increasing levels of PKCβII protein accompany the switch of mRNA products. In this case, we have linked the functional significance of alternative mRNA splicing of PKCβI and βII to glucose transport. Glucose transport is stimulated by insulin in a number of tissues and cells (37Fu X.-D. Nature. 1993; 365: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). There appear to be PKCα and PKCβ-dependent components in rat adipocytes demonstrated with antisense oligonucleotides to down-regulate these isozymes (29Farese R.V. Standaert M.L. Ishizuka T. Yu B. Hernandez H. Waldron C. Watson J. Farese J.P. Cooper D.R. Wickstrom E. Antisense Res. Dev. 1991; 1: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In other studies, insulin-dependent glucose transport was restored by introducing PKCα and PKCβ enzymes into PKC-depleted adipocytes (28Cooper D.R. Watson J.E. Hernandez H. Yu B. Standaert M.L. Ways D.K. Arnold T.T. Ishizuka T. Farese R.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For the present studies, we stably transfected NIH-3T3 cells to overexpress PKCβI and PKCβII. Overexpression of PKCβII but not PKCβI further enhanced insulin-dependent increases in glucose transport. Whether this same relationship between PKCβI and PKCβII is relevant to other cell types must await further studies. It may be of interest that both BC3H-1 myocytes and NIH-3T3 cells, murine cell lines, express GLUT1-type glucose transporters. Functional differences between PKCβI and -βII have also been demonstrated in other systems. PKCβI was found to be more efficient in inactivating glycogen synthase kinase-3β by phosphorylation than PKCβII (38Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes the redistribution of PKCβI from the perinuclear membrane to the nucleolus while PKCβII translocated from the cytoplasm to the perinuclear and plasma membrane following TPA and norepinephrine treatment was shown (39Cascieri M.A. Chicchi G.G. Hayes N.S. Slater E.E. Circ. Res. 1986; 59: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that not only do the catalytic potentials of PKCβI and-βII differ, but their ability to translocate to distinct intracellular compartments is also distinct. The present studies indicate that the ability of cells to respond to signals from insulin may depend upon the presence of one PKCβ isoform versus the other, and their expression is regulated by insulin. Insulin stimulation of cells leads to increases in diacylglycerol and, hence, activates several PKC isozymes. Our data suggest that this rather nonspecific activation of PKC isozymes is further fine tuned by the control of PKC isozyme expression via alternative splicing of PKCβ. The rapidity of the switching observed in BC3H-1 myocytes infers that this process has functional consequences under varying physiological states. Although it is recognized that developmental stages or cell types can express different PKCβ transcripts (11Ono Y. Kurokawa T. Fujii T. Kawahara K. Igarashi K. Kikkawa U. Ogita K. Nishizuka Y.

The Escherichia coli replicase, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme), has traditionally been difficult to obtain in large quantity due to its low cellular concentration (10-20 molecules/cell) (1Kornberg A.

In this report, we have used the pure subunits to determine how to assemble the nine-subunit polymerase (Pol)1( 1The abbreviations used are: PolpolymeraseDMSdimethyl suberimidateHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographySSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding of protein E. coli.) III∗ and to obtain it in large quantity. polymerase dimethyl suberimidate high pressure liquid chromatography single-stranded DNA-binding of protein E. coli. Previously, we described the constitution of the four-subunit Pol III′ subassembly (α2ε2θ2τ2), which consists of a τ dimer that serves, among other things, as a scaffold to hold together two core polymerases (13McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2657-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the first report of this series, we described the constitution and subunit composition of the five-subunit γ complex clamp loader (γ2δ1δ′1χ1ψ1), the molecular matchmaker that assembles β clamps onto DNA (15Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Since the γ complex and Pol III′ together account for the full complement of subunits of the nine-subunit Pol III∗ assembly, we presumed that Pol III∗ would be constituted upon mixing these two subassemblies. Hence, we were surprised to find that Pol III′ and the γ complex did not associate with each other even when mixed at high concentrations (25 μM each). The fact that Pol III′ and the γ complex do not easily associate with one another suggests that once they are formed in the cell, they stay separated. Perhaps their inability to associate serves the purpose of isolating their separate functions for specialized tasks with other proteins such as in repair or recombination. In this study, methods by which Pol III∗ can be assembled in vitro are described. Assembly depends upon staging the addition of subunits in a defined order. The resulting Pol III∗ remains associated even when diluted to 30 nM. Thus, once pol III∗ is assembled, it is tightly associated and does not easily fall apart. The ability to assemble Pol III∗ from overproduced subunits provided the material to analyze the stoichiometry of the subunits in the particle. The assembly process, the stoichiometry of subunits, and the implications of the results to the asymmetric structure and function of Pol III holoenzyme are the subject of this report. All methods, materials, and sources not described here were described in the first report of this series (15Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Gel filtration was performed as described in the first report, except when Superose 6 was used, 4.8 ml was collected before the start of collecting fractions. Buffer B contained 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Assays were performed as described for the γ complex in the first report (15Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), except that in Pol III∗ assays, the αε complex was omitted (only β was added to the assay). Assays of column fractions from the analysis of 30 nM Pol III∗ and γ complex required the addition of 10 μl of undiluted column fraction to each assay. Assays comparing the specific activities of Pol III∗ forms were only allowed to proceed for 20 s, sufficient time to finish one primed template. Proteins were incubated in buffer A for 30 min at 15°C unless stated otherwise. The concentrations of all subunits except τ and γ are expressed as monomer. The concentrations of γ and τ are expressed as dimer since this is their final aggregation state when assembled with the other subunits. A mixture of 10 mg (78 nmol) of α, 6.4 mg (229 nmol) of ε, and 6 mg (698 nmol) of θ was incubated in a volume of 7.4 ml and then chromatographed on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column eluted with a 32-ml linear gradient of 0-0.4 M NaCl in buffer A. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The core polymerase eluted at ~0.25 M NaCl (11 mg final concentration). The γδ′χψ complex was made in two steps. First, the γχψ complex was constituted and purified as described (6Xiao H. Dong Z. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11779-11784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and then δ′ was added, and the resulting γδ′χψ complex was purified (however, the γδ′χψ complex can also be made by mixing all four subunits, followed by purification on Mono Q). The γχψ complex (1.5 mg, 52.5 nmol) was incubated with δ′ (3.89 mg, 105 nmol) in 3.06 ml, and then the mixture was chromatographed on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with buffer A. The γδ′χψ complex was eluted from the column with a 32-ml linear gradient of 0-0.4 M NaCl in buffer A. The γδ′χψ complex eluted last at ~0.28 M NaCl. Column fractions containing γδ′χψ were pooled (4.2 mg in 3 ml) and stored at −70°C. The γ complex was constituted and purified by chromatography on a Mono Q column as described in the first report of this series (15Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Pol III′ was constituted by mixing α, ε, θ, and τ at a molar ratio of 3:4.5:6.75:1 (molarity of τ as dimer, the rest as monomer) in buffer A and incubating for 30 min at 15°C (see figure legends for total protein concentrations). Pol III′ was concentrated to 100 μl by spin dialysis using a Centricon 30 apparatus (Amicon, Inc.) and isolated by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column to remove excess core, εθ complex, and θ subunit. Pol III∗ lacking γ was constituted upon incubating τ (239 μg, 0.84 nmol), χ (40.5 μg, 2.44 nmol), and ψ (30 μg, 1.97 nmol, in 6 μl of 4 M urea) in a final volume of 98.1 μl, after which δ (92 μg, 2.38 nmol) and δ′ (73.7 μg, 1.99 nmol) were added. This mixture was further incubated for 30 min at 15°C, at which time α (239 μg, 1.99 nmol), ε (67.6 μg, 2.46 nmol), and θ (24.13 μg, 2.8 nmol) were added to a final volume of 260 μl containing 5 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM ATP. This mixture was further incubated for 30 min at 15°C and then concentrated to 100 μl at 4°C with a Centricon 30 apparatus, followed by purification through gel filtration on a Superose 6 column. Two general methods were used to constitute Pol III∗. In Method 1, first the χψ complex was constituted and dialyzed to remove urea in the ψ preparation by mixing 1.414 mg (85 nmol) of χ with 0.864 mg (57 nmol) of ψ in a final volume of 4.2 ml (urea was present at 0.7 M) for 1 h and then dialyzing against buffer A. The τ subunit (504 μg, 3.5 nmol) was incubated for 60 min with the χψ complex (224 μg, 7 nmol) in 488 μl. The γ subunit (1.0 mg, 10.6 nmol) was incubated with the χψ complex (676 μg, 22 nmol) for 60 min in 1.953 ml. The mixtures were then combined and incubated for 1 h, after which a 665-μl mixture of 787 μg of δ′ and 823 μg of δ (21.3 nmol each) was added, followed by a further incubation for 30 min. During this time, the core polymerase was constituted in a separate tube containing α (2.77 mg, 21.3 nmol), ε (878 μg, 31.9 nmol), and θ (412 μg, 47.9 nmol) in 5.4 ml for 1 h. Then core was combined with the τγδδ′χψ mixture and incubated for 1 h. The mixture was then loaded onto a 4-ml heparin-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a 40-ml linear gradient of 0-325 mM NaCl in buffer A. Eighty fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected. Column fractions were analyzed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and those containing Pol III∗ were pooled (fractions 32-50), concentrated with the Centricon 30 apparatus to 230 μl, and loaded onto a 24-ml Superose 6 column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 M NaCl. Fractions of 200 μl were collected and analyzed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Fractions containing Pol III∗ were pooled (total protein, 760 μg in 2 ml) and stored at −70°C. Assuming a mass of 670 kDa for Pol III∗, if all the τ had been incorporated, there would have been 2.39 mg of Pol III∗. Hence, the recovery by this procedure is ~32%. Two other preparations of Pol III∗ were assembled by this same general method with the following exceptions. The χψ complex was initially placed exclusively on γ by starting with the pure γχψ complex (and τ was not incubated with χψ). In the other variation, χψ was initially placed only on τ by using pure τχψ (prepared similarly to γχψ), and γ was not incubated with χψ. In Method 2, 6.6 mg (52.5 nmol) of γχψ complex (prepared as described (6Xiao H. Dong Z. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11779-11784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was mixed with 3.89 mg (105 nmol) of δ′ in a volume of 3 ml, followed by incubation for 30 min. The mixture was chromatographed on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a 32-ml linear gradient of 0-0.4 M NaCl in buffer A (see Fig. 3). Fractions 40-43 were pooled to yield 4.2 mg of γδ′χψ complex. The τ subunit (0.19 mg, 1.34 nmol) was mixed with 0.8 mg of γδ′χψ complex in 1.6 ml for 1 h followed by the addition of 0.36 mg (9.33 nmol) of δ in a final volume of 2.75 ml and incubated for an additional 30 min. During this time, core was constituted upon incubating α (0.516 mg, 4 nmol), ε (162 μg, 6 nmol), and θ (77 μg, 8.95 nmol) in 183 μl for 30 min. Core was mixed with the τγδδ′χψ mixture and incubated for 60 min and then was loaded onto a 2-ml heparin-Affi-Gel column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer B and eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of 0-0.325 M NaCl in buffer B. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and analyzed on a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for Pol III∗ and the γ complex. Fractions 38-54 were pooled and loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column and then eluted as described for the γδ′χψ complex. Fractions were analyzed for Pol III∗ on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and fractions 45-50 were pooled, concentrated to 200 μl using a Centricon 30 apparatus, and gel-filtered on a 24-ml Superose 6 column in buffer A containing 100 mM NaCl. Fractions of 190 μl were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fractions 25-30 were pooled (41 μg of Pol III∗) and stored at −70°C. Recovery by this procedure is ~5%. Another preparation of Pol III∗ was assembled by this method using a τδ′χψ complex instead of γδ′χψ and adding γ later. Solutions of 32 fmol of γ (as dimer), 32 fmol of τ (as dimer), or a mixture of 16 fmol each of γ and τ were incubated at 15°C for 30 min in 80 μl of 50 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 8.1), 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, or 2 M NaCl. The solutions were shifted to 25°C, and 8 μl of dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) at 11 mg/ml in the same buffer (but at pH 10) was added. After 30 min at 25°C, the reactions were quenched upon adding 8 μl of 1 M glycine and analyzed by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To constitute Pol III∗, we initially mixed Pol III′ (αεθτ)2 and the γ complex (γδδ′χψ) together under the assumption they would associate into Pol III∗ (αεθτγδδ′χψ). In replication assays, the mixture of Pol III′ and the γ complex is essentially as effective in providing processive DNA synthesis with β as the Pol III∗ assembly is. Hence, to assay formation of Pol III∗, we could not use simple replication assays, but needed to follow the assembly by physical methods. In Fig. 1, we assayed Pol III∗ assembly by gel filtration and analyzed the column fractions by Coomassie Blue staining of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. In Fig. 1(A and B), the γ complex and Pol III′ assembly were analyzed separately. The γ complex elutes in fractions 26-34 (Fig. 1A), and Pol III′ peaks in fractions 14-22 (Fig. 1B). If Pol III′ and the γ complex associate into Pol III∗, then all nine subunits should coelute in a position earlier than either complex alone. Analysis of the mixture of Pol III′ and the γ complex in Fig. 1C shows that they do not associate to a significant extent; the subunits neither comigrate nor elute substantially earlier. However, the slightly earlier elution of the γ complex in the presence of Pol III′ may indicate a weak interaction with Pol III′ that is not stabile to gel filtration. One explanation for this result is that the association of Pol III′ with the γ complex is too weak to isolate the Pol III∗ complex under the nonequilibrium conditions of gel filtration. An earlier report showed that Pol III∗ isolated naturally from E. coli was isolable as a complex on the same gel filtration matrix; however, it appeared to partially dissociate as its concentration was decreased (16Maki H. Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6570-6578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experiment of Fig. 1 was performed at a concentration of 1 μM each Pol III′ and γ complex and thus may be less concentrated than needed. However, we have performed gel filtration of these complexes at a concentration of 28 μM with the same result as in Fig. 1(17Onrust, R., 1993, The Structure and Function of the Accessory Proteins of the E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Ph.D. thesis, Cornell University Medical College.Google Scholar). In the experiments below, we show that Pol III∗ can indeed be assembled by the appropriate order of subunit addition and that once formed, Pol III∗ is stabile to gel filtration even at a concentration of 30 nM. After numerous studies using different orders of subunit addition, methods to constitute Pol III∗ were discovered. In overview, formation of Pol III∗ requires that the τ and γ subunits associate with each other, and this γ-τ association does not occur when using intact Pol III′ and the γ complex. The underlying reason that τ (in Pol III′) could not bind γ (in the γ complex) rested with the δ subunit, which prevented their interaction; δ needed to be added after γ and τ were preincubated.2( 2In fact, any γ assembly containing δ (i.e. γδδ′, γδδ′ψ, γδδ′χ) will not bind τ. The converse is also true: a τ assembly containing δ (i.e. τδδ′, τδδ′ψ, τδδ′χψ) will not bind γ (17Onrust, R., 1993, The Structure and Function of the Accessory Proteins of the E. coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Ph.D. thesis, Cornell University Medical College.Google Scholar) (R. Onrust and M. O'Donnell, unpublished data).) In fact, the γ-τ contact could be made upon incubating Pol III′ with a complex of γδ′χψ (γ complex lacking δ), and subsequent addition of δ resulted in formation of Pol III∗. In the course of these studies, we identified an additional reaction that inhibited interaction of τ with γ, thus preventing Pol III∗ formation. The δ′ subunit can bind both τ and γ as shown previously (ψ must also be present on γ (τ) for δ′ to stably associate with γ (τ) (15Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar)), but if δ′ is allowed to bind both γ and τ, it prevents the essential association of γ with τ. The results of adding δ and δ′ at different points in the assembly scheme are summarized in Fig. 2. Study of these necessary orders of addition is presented below (see Fig. 10, Fig. 11). Mixtures of complexes that do not result in productive assembly are shown in Fig. 2 with an X. Although the addition of χ and ψ is shown near the beginning of the assembly scheme and core (αεθ) is added near the end, χ, ψ, and core can be added at any stage without preventing the formation of a Pol III∗ complex. The schemes in Fig. 3 outline the two methods by which Pol III∗ was assembled for the studies in this report. In Method 1, the key feature is that γ and τ are premixed before the addition of δ and δ′. The determining feature of Method 2 is that δ′ is first assembled onto γ (or τ); then excess δ′ is removed by ion-exchange chromatography before adding τ (or γ) so that the γ-τ interaction is productive, and then δ is added subsequently. Provided the requirements described above are satisfied in the assembly scheme, the rest of the subunits can be added at any step (or together), and a nine-subunit Pol III∗ will assemble. For example, in Method 1, the χψ subunits and the core polymerase can be added to γ and/or τ before or after mixing γ with τ. In Method 2, ψ (or χψ) must be added initially to stabilize the association of δ′ with γ (or τ), but χ and core can be added at any point in the scheme. Staging the addition of subunits in various ways may, in principle, result in different subunit orientations within Pol III∗ (see “Discussion”). We have compared five preparations of Pol III∗ assembled using three variations of Method 1 and two variations of Method 2 (see “Discussion”). The Pol III∗ used in most of these studies was assembled by Method 1 (unless stated otherwise). In any assembly scheme, the “outer” subunits such as χ and θ must be added in excess over subunits more “central” to the structure such that all complexes are driven to completion. The τ subunit is the most central since it binds both the γ complex and core, and therefore, τ must be limiting in the assembly scheme. The γ-τ interaction appears to be an equilibrium. We typically push the γ-τ association by adding a 3-fold excess of γ over τ; however, the excess γ complex that forms is difficult to separate from Pol III∗ (explained below). If insufficient γ is used to push this equilibrium, then an eight-subunit form of Pol III assembles that has all the subunits except γ (referred to below as “γ-less Pol III∗”). It is desirable to reduce the amount of γ-less Pol III∗, even at the expense of forming excess γ complex, since it is most difficult to separate γ-less Pol III∗ from Pol III∗. After all the subunit additions, Pol III∗ can be purified from excess subunits and smaller subassemblies as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4A shows the profile of elution from a heparin column, which partially resolves excess γ complex (fractions 23-38) from Pol III∗ (fractions 32-54). Fractions 38-54 were pooled, resulting in some loss of Pol III∗ at the expense of removing the bulk of excess γ complex. Excess δ and δ′ coelute with Pol III∗ on the heparin column, but are cleanly separated from Pol III∗ by chromatography on a Mono Q column (Fig. 4B). Fractions 45-50 were pooled, concentrated, and passed over a Superose 6 gel filtration column to remove the remaining γ complex (Fig. 4C). The persistent γ complex contaminant (fractions 32-38) now resolves from Pol III∗ (fractions 22-28), and the γ-less Pol III∗ contaminant becomes apparent (fractions 16-20). γ-less Pol III∗ has a higher molecular mass and elutes earlier than Pol III∗.3( 3γ-less Pol III∗ has a Stokes radius of 97 Å for a mass of ~1 MDa and a specific activity of 4.9 pmol/min/mg. We propose that γ-less Pol III∗ is composed of a tetramer of τ in which a τ dimer replaces the γ dimer in associating with δ, δ′, χ, and ψ and the other τ dimer has two core polymerases.) To remove γ-less Pol III∗ and the γ complex from the preparation, we pooled a narrow range of fractions (fractions 25-30). The size of constituted Pol III∗ was estimated by gel filtration analysis and comparison to size standards in Fig. 5. Pol III∗ peaks at fractions 23-27, followed by remaining excess γ complex in fractions 29-35 (Fig. 5A). Pol III∗ activity assays (Fig. 5B) show that the active fractions correspond to Pol III∗ with a Stokes radius of 85 Å for a mass of ~670-680 kDa (see Table II). The mass of Pol III∗ purified from E. coli cell lysates (without protein overproduction) was also analyzed by gel filtration (Fig. 5C). It eluted in the same position as constituted Pol III∗, reasonably consistent with a previous study estimating the mass of naturally purified Pol III∗ at 800 kDa (16Maki H. Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6570-6578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIAverage subunit stoichiometry and calculated mass of Pol III∗Table IIAverage subunit stoichiometry and calculated mass of Pol III∗ We tried to determine the molar ratio of subunits in Pol III∗ by the HPLC technique (14Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but could not identify a gradient that resolved all the subunits.4( 4The α and δ′ subunits did not resolve on the HPLC column by any gradient or elution program that we tried. For those subunits that did resolve, the molar ratio was ε1.6θNDτ2.0γ2.8δ0.9χ1.0ψ1.2 (where ND is not determined).) Hence, we estimated the molar ratio of subunits in constituted Pol III∗ and naturally purified Pol III∗ by laser densitometry of a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel in which the differences in staining for each subunit were corrected by comparison to individual subunits of known concentration analyzed on the same gel (Fig. 6). The scan of constituted Pol III∗ (Fig. 6A) is similar to that of naturally purified Pol III∗ (Fig. 6B). The concentrations of the individual Pol III∗ subunits used as standards were determined from their extinction coefficients at 280 nm. The quantitation of the analysis is shown in Table I. All values are normalized to the τ subunit.Table ISubunit stoichiometry of constituted Pol III∗ and Pol III∗ purified from E. coli cell lysatesTable ISubunit stoichiometry of constituted Pol III∗ and Pol III∗ purified from E. coli cell lysates The ratio of the α, ε, and τ subunits was approximately equimolar for both constituted Pol III∗ and Pol III∗ purified from cell lysates. The intensity of the θ subunit was too weak to be determined accurately in this study; but previous studies showed that the stoichiometry of the εθ complex is 1:1, and therefore, it is assumed here that θ is equimolar to ε in Pol III∗ (7Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11785-11791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The γ subunit in both reconstituted Pol III∗ and Pol III∗ purified from E. coli lysates is also approximately equimolar to α, ε, and τ. However, even though the δ, δ′, χ, and ψ subunits were added in excess during the assembly of Pol III∗, these subunits are present at approximately half the amount of the α, ε, τ, and γ subunits in both constituted Pol III∗ and E. coli purified Pol III∗. The results for both constituted and naturally purified Pol III∗ are most consistent with a dimer of γ and τ, two each of the core subunits (αεθ), and only one each of the δ, δ′, χ, and ψ subunits. The single copy nature of δ and δ′ can be seen by simple inspection of the scans in Fig. 6 by comparing the greater peak height of the double copy ε subunit (27.5 kDa) relative to the heights of the larger molecular mass but single copy δ (38.7 kDa) and δ′ (37.0 kDa) subunits. This result is also consistent with previous studies on the composition of Pol III′ (α2ε2θ2τ2) that showed it to be composed of two of each subunit (13McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2657-2663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although an earlier study of Pol III∗ purified from cell lysates suggested there were two of each subunit, analysis of the holoenzyme in that same study gave the following composition (after setting τ to two): α2τ2γ2.56δ1.24δ′1.24ε2.02χ1.14-ψ0.90θ1.24β4.28 (16Maki H. Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6570-6578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), quite consistent with the subunit ratios obtained in this report. The subunit stoichiometry predicts the molecular mass of Pol III∗ to be 673 kDa as summarized in Table II, consistent with the size estimated by gel filtration. The activity of constituted Pol III∗ in the β-dependent replication of singly primed M13mp18 single-stranded DNA coated with SSB was compared with that of Pol III∗ purified from cell lysates. The results (Fig. 7) show that constituted Pol III∗ is slightly more active than Pol III∗ purified from cell lysates; their specific activities were 3.4 × 106 and 2.3 × 106 pmol of nucleotide incorporated per mg/min, respectively. Constituted Pol III∗ is similar to Pol III∗ purified from lysates with respect to size, subunit stoichiometry, and replication activity, thus indicating that constituted Pol III∗ is authentic. How tightly associated is Pol III∗? In the cell, there are 10-20 molecules of Pol III∗ for a concentration of 17-34 nM(1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 165-194Google Scholar). In Fig. 8, we tested the ability of the Pol III∗ particle to remain intact at a concentration similar to that in the cell. At 30 nM Pol III∗, the subunits are far below the limit of detection in column fractions by Coomassie Blue staining (or silver staining) of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Hence, Pol III∗ was identified in column fractions by assaying for β-dependent replication of singly primed M13mp18 SSB-coated single-stranded DNA. If Pol III∗ falls apart, the γ complex, upon dissociating from within Pol III∗, should elute much later. Hence, the column fractions were also assayed for the γ complex. The results show that Pol III∗ and the intrinsic γ complex activities comigrate in fractions 16-28, consistent with the size of Pol III∗ and with the particle remaining intact during gel filtration at these dilute conditions. As a control, a second gel filtration analysis using 30 nM γ complex showed the expected elution position of γ complex activity had Pol III∗ dissociated (Fig. 8, dashedline).

The sequence of the NH2 termini of the purified protein (5 amino acid residues) coincided with the signal sequence of HSP60. These facts led to the identification of the 60-kDa liver protein with the chaperonin homolog. Dihydrofolate reductase was able to form a stable complex with the liver chaperonin homolog. The liver chaperonin homolog was detected by at least five spots around pI = 5.6 on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting studies using an antibody against chaperonin homolog showed that the chaperonin homolog was localized in the cytosol, mitochondrial, and nuclear fractions of porcine liver. The chaperonin homolog was localized both in the mitochondria and cytoplasm of rat kidneys at the electron microscopic level. The chaperonin homolog in the cytosol, but not in the other subcellular fractions, was cross-reacted with an antibody against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the signal peptide of HSP60 as well as the purified chaperonin homolog on immunoblotting.

All living cells display a rapid molecular response to adverse environmental conditions, a phenomenon designated as the heat shock response. Because other kinds of stress show similar effects, this process can be considered as a general cellular response to metabolic disturbances. The most striking feature of the heat shock response is the induced synthesis of a set of proteins conserved during evolution, the heat shock proteins (HSPs)1( 1The abbreviations used are: HSPheat shock proteinHSP60 and HSP73heat shock proteins with subunit molecular mass of 60 kDa and 73 kDaGRP78glucose-regulated protein with subunit molecular mass of 78 kDaSDS-PAGEsodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisIEFisoelectric focusingDHFRdihydrofolate reductaseH2FdihydrofolateHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography.) or stress proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 1Schlesinger M.J.

This raises the possibility that stress proteins play some important roles in the physiology of normal cells. Many stress proteins, including members of the HSP70 and HSP60 families (molecular masses of 70 and 60 kDa, respectively), are constitutively expressed and fulfill essential functions as “molecular chaperones” under normal cellular conditions (4Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar, 5Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The HSP60s, which are found in bacterial cytosol as well as in the mitochondria and chloroplast, are present in a highly self-associated form, double-ring complexes consisting of 14 60-kDa subunits (groEL) (6Horn T. Horn B. Engel A. Wurtz M. Smith P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 7Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). These “chaperonins” interact with early intermediates in the protein folding pathway and mediate the acquisition of the native structure of newly synthesized proteins by releasing the substrate in an ATP-dependent process (8Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 9Ostermann J. Horwich A.L. Neupert W. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1989; 341: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The ATP hydrolytic activity of chaperonins is regulated by smaller co-chaperonins, a ring complex of seven 10-kDa subunits (groES) (10Chandrasekhar G.N. Tilly K. Woolford C. Hendrix R. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12414-12419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Martin J. Mayhew M. Langer T. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1993; 366: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there are few reports on mammalian HSP60 because of the difficulty of purification of the protein. Guputa and co-workers (12Guputa R.S. Venner T.J. Chopra A. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Picketts D.J. Mayanil C.S.K. Guputa R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12001-12008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) originally raised an antibody against a 63-kDa mitochondrial protein (P1 protein) of Chinese hamster ovary cells, which was purified from excised protein spots in a large number of gel sheets of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. They have recently isolated a complete cDNA encoding this protein from HL-60 cells (14Jindal S. Dudani A.K. Singh B. Harley C.B. Guputa R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2279-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA shows a homology to those of the bacterial and plant chaperonins and to the 65-kDa major antigen of mycobacterial 65-kDa stress protein (HSP65). Thus, the human P1 protein is now called human HSP60 or a chaperonin homolog (15Singh B. Patel H.V. Ridley R.G. Freeman K.B. Guputa R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the degree of the sequence conservation between groEL and P1 protein (HSP60) is very similar; ~50% of the amino acid residues are identical, and an additional ~20% of the residues are conservative replacements (14Jindal S. Dudani A.K. Singh B. Harley C.B. Guputa R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2279-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). HSP60 has a signal sequence (1-26 amino acid residues from the amino termini of HSP60). The protein may be transported into the mitochondria by a process similar to that of other imported mitochondrial proteins. HSP60 is converted into a mature form of lower molecular mass (~58 kDa) in the mitochondria. The import of HSP60 into mitochondria is inhibited in the presence of an uncoupler, and also no import occurred when the amino-terminal presequence (signal sequence) is lacking (15Singh B. Patel H.V. Ridley R.G. Freeman K.B. Guputa R.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because of the above reasons, we distinguish HSP60 (chaperonin homolog) from mitochondrial HSP60 in this report. Recently, Mizzen et al.(16Mizzen L.A. Chang C. Garrels J.I. Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20664-20675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported the purification of mitochondrial HSP60 from HeLa cells using detergents and stated that the protein had no ATP-binding activity. We also have reported the purification of mitochondrial HSP60 using guanidine hydrochloride and observed that the protein had collagen-binding activity (17Wakui H. Itoh H. Tashima Y. Kobayashi R. Nakamoto Y. Miura A.B. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). However, there is no report on the characteristics of mammalian HSP60. Several important physiological roles of the proposed HSP60 are raised. For example, Ikawa and Weinberg have reported the association of HSP60 with p21ras (18Ikawa S. Weinberg R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2012-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The purification of mammalian HSP60 is essential to understanding its physiological functions. In the present study, we tried to purify and characterize HSP60 (chaperonin homolog) and will discuss its possible roles. ATP-Sepharose was prepared as described previously (19Itoh H. Tashima Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). DE-52, Mono Q column, and ampholines were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Lysyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.50) was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). GroEL was from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Germany), and anti-Yersinia enterocolitica HSP60 monoclonal antibody was from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Bovine liver dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3) was from Sigma. Fresh porcine livers were obtained from a local slaughterhouse and stored at −30°C prior to use. Purification of the 60-kDa protein involved a slightly modified version of the purification method of HSP73 as described previously (19Itoh H. Tashima Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). All operations were carried out at 0-4°C. Frozen livers (about 800 g) were chopped and then homogenized with 3 volumes of buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate added at a concentration of 27.7 g/100 ml. After the mixture was stirred for 30 min, the precipitates were discarded by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and additional ammonium sulfate was added at 33.9 g/100 ml of the supernatant. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation, dissolved in buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl and 15 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4), and dialyzed overnight against buffer B; the dialysis solution was changed several times. The dialysate was applied onto a DEAE-cellulose column (5 × 10 cm) pre-equilibrated in buffer B. After the column was washed with buffer C (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), the proteins were eluted with 3 column-bed volumes of buffer C containing 0.15 M NaCl. The eluate fractions containing protein peaks were combined, and MgCl2 was added at a final concentration of 5 mM. The solution was applied onto a tandem ATP-Sepharose column (two columns were connected directly: the upper column, 2 × 7 cm; the lower column, 2 × 3 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer D (10 mM Tris-HCl, and 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4). After the columns were removed from each other, each column was washed with 3 column-bed volumes of buffer D containing 0.5 M NaCl and then washed with the same volumes of buffer D. The proteins were eluted with buffer D containing 3 mM ATP and fractionated for each column. If necessary, the elutant from the lower ATP-Sepharose column was applied onto a Mono Q column pre-equilibrated in buffer C and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.6 M NaCl in buffer C. The protein peak fractions were combined and stored at −80°C. Mitochondrial HSP60 was purified from porcine livers or porcine kidneys using guanidine hydrochloride as described previously (17Wakui H. Itoh H. Tashima Y. Kobayashi R. Nakamoto Y. Miura A.B. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out by the procedure of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 7-10% polyacrylamide gel. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described by O'Farrell (21O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed in the first dimension on an isoelectric focusing gel with a pH gradient of 5-7. Electrophoresis for the second dimension was performed on a 7% acrylamide slab gel with SDS. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in a mixture of 25% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid and destained with 10% isopropyl alcohol and 10% acetic acid. An antibody to the porcine 60-kDa liver protein was produced by intramuscular injection into a rabbit of 1 mg of the protein emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Booster shots were given 3 times in the same manner as the original injection at 2-week intervals. The rabbit was bled 10 days after the last injection. Peptide corresponding to amino-acids 1-7 of the signal peptide of human HSP60 (MLRLPTV) was synthesized by solid phase techniques on an Applied Biosystems peptide synthesizer (Foster City, CA) model 433A with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) 1-hydroxybenzotriazole/N-methylpyrrolidone chemistry. After cleavage, peptide was purified by reverse-phase HPLC before use. The synthetic peptide (2.0 mg) was solved in 0.15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 2.7 mM KCl, 137 mM NaCl (pH 7.4)). The solution was mildly shaken with 0.3 ml of 50% (v/v) polyvinyl pyrolidone in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at room temperature. The conjugated solution, emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant, was injected into a rabbit intramuscle. Booster shots were given 3 times in the same manner as the original injection at 2-week intervals. The rabbit was bled 10 days after the last injection. The protocols for animal experimentation described in this paper were previously approved by the Animal Research Committee, Akita University School of Medicine; the “Guidelines for Animal Experimentation” of the University were completely adhered to in all subsequent animal experiments. Porcine livers were subcellularly fractionated as described previously (22Itoh H. Tashima Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All operations were carried out at 0-4°C. Porcine livers were homogenized with buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 M sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA). After centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min, the precipitates (P1) and supernatant (S1) were treated by further centrifugation. The precipitates (P1) were dissolved in 0.25 M sucrose and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The 5,000 × g precipitate was used as the mitochondrial fraction. The supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 54,000 × g for 60 min, and the precipitate was used as the microsomal fraction. The 54,000 × g supernatant was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The 105,000 × g supernatant was used as the cytosol. For the nuclear fraction, porcine livers were homogenized with 20 volumes of 2.2 M sucrose and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The precipitate was used as the nuclear fraction. The purities of four subcellular fractions were checked by measuring marker enzymes or DNA, which localize in each fraction (cytosol, alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1); mitochondrial fraction, succinate-cytochrome c reductase (EC 1.3.99.1); microsomal fraction, glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 2.4.1.22); nuclear fraction, DNA) and by using an electron microscope. Alcohol dehydrogenase, succinate-cytochrome c reductase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and DNA were determined as described by Lad and Leffert (23Lad P.J. Leffert H.L. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 350-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), Bernath and Singer (24Bernath P. Singer T.P. Methods Enzymol. 1962; 5: 597-614Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Nordlie and Arison (25Nordlie R.C. Arion W.J. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 619-625Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and Anderson and Skagen (26Anderson K.-J. amd Skagen D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), respectively. Samples were developed on SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and processed as described by Towbin et al.(27Towbin H. Staechelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) for immunoblotting. After the membranes were incubated with an anti 60-kDa liver protein antibody (diluted 1:1,000 in 7% skim milk), an antibody against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the signal sequence of HSP60 (diluted 1:200 in 7% skim milk) or anti-HSP60 monoclonal antibody (diluted 1: 20 in 7% skim milk), they were subsequently treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) (diluted 1:1,000 in 7% skim milk) or treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) (diluted 1:1,000 in 7% skim milk). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by reacting the bound peroxidase with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and H2O2. The purified 60-kDa liver protein or the 78-, 73-, 43-, and 30-kDa proteins, which were eluted from the ATP-Sepharose column, were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 in a mixture of 25% isopropyl alcohol, and these protein bands were excised. Using a lysyl endopeptidase, production and separation of peptides from the protein were carried out according to the method of Kawasaki et al.(28Kawasaki H. Emori T. Suzuki K. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The peptides were purified by HPLC. A column of Wakopak (Wakosil 5C18) was connected to an HPLC apparatus (Pharmacia LKB HPLC equipped with two model 2150 pumps, a model 2150 HPLC controller, and a model 2158 Uvicord S.D. UV detector was used for purification of the peptides). The peptide was applied onto the column pre-equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The purified peptides were detected at 206 nm. Because the NH2 terminus of the purified protein was blocked, a protein deblocking kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) was used to determine the NH2 termini of the purified 60-kDa protein. The determination of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified peptide or deblocked protein was performed with a model 477A protein sequencer with an on-line 120A phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). DHFR enzyme assays were conducted in quartz cuvettes with a 1-cm path length according to the method of Viitanen et al.(29Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was assayed in the direction of NADPH oxidation in the presence of dihydrofolate (H2F). The reactions (final volume, 600 μl) were constructed in 1.5-ml microfuge tubes containing 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 3.3 mM KCl, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and the purified 60-kDa protein (1.0 μM), in the presence or absence of H2F (0.1 mM) and NADPH (0.1 mM). The reaction was initiated by the rapid addition of native DHFR or denatured DHFR by 5 M guanidine hydrochloride to a final concentration of 0.5 μM. After this addition, the reactants were immediately transferred to cuvettes, and A340 was monitored or the reactants were incubated for 5, 15, or 30 min prior to their supplementation with H2F (0.1 mM) and NADPH (0.1 mM). After this addition, these reactants were immediately transferred to cuvettes, and A340 was monitored. Electron microscopic immunohistochemistry of rat kidneys was performed as described previously (30Ohtani H. Wakui H. Ishino T. Komatsuda A. Miura A.B. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ultrathin sections of rat kidneys were cut with a diamond knife and mounted on gold grids. The sections were stained by the immunogold-silver staining method for electron microscopy using a silver enhancing kit (BioCell Research Laboratories). These sections were incubated with an antibody against the 60-kDa protein (200-fold dilution in buffer E: 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2% NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) for 18 h at room temperature. The sections were washed with buffer E and incubated with gold-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Nanoprobes, NY; 400-fold dilution in buffer E) for 1 h at room temperature. After further washing with distilled water, the sections were incubated with the silver developer of the enhancing kit for approximately 10 min at room temperature. Sections were counter-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Tissue fixation and immunoperoxidase staining were performed as described previously (31Itoh H. Toyoshima I. Mizunuma H. Kobayashi R. Tashima Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue pieces were fixed with peroxidase lysine, 4% paraformaldehyde. Rat liver and pancreas were sliced (5 μm) in a cryostat. After blocking of endogenous peroxidase using 0.3% H2O2 in methanol, the tissue sections were incubated with anti-60-kDa liver protein antibody (diluted 1:250 in 5% bovine serum albumin) for 12 h at 4°C. The sections were then incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Labs) for 40 min at room temperature, and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Labs) was applied for 40 min at room temperature. Sites of peroxidase activity were visualized with 0.02% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride containing 0.005% H2O2. Proteins were measured by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. In this study, we used HSP73 prepared as described previously (19Itoh H. Tashima Y. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and porcine liver GRP78 prepared by the method submitted for publication. The liver 60-kDa protein was purified by the method described under “Materials and Methods.” In this method, tandem ATP-Sepharose column chromatography was employed. When the eluted fractions from DEAE-cellulose column were chromatographed on the upper ATP-Sepharose column, some proteins (subunit molecular mass of 78-, 73-, 68-, 60-, 43-, and 30-kDa proteins) were eluted from the column (Fig. 1). In these proteins, the 60-kDa protein was a minor protein. These proteins were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (9% gel) and digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the digests were purified by HPLC and subsequently sequenced by a protein sequencer. The 78-, 73-, 68-, and 43-kDa liver proteins were identical with GRP78, HSP73, and the NH2-terminal fragments of HSP73, respectively (data not shown). On the other hand, the 60-kDa protein was eluted as a major protein from the lower ATP-Sepharose column with minor HSP73 (Fig. 2). The eluted protein pattern was quite different from the upper ATP-Sepharose column chromatography. After the Mono Q column chromatography, the final preparation gave only a single-band protein (60 kDa) by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Four milligrams of the protein was obtained from 800 g of fresh porcine liver.Fig. 2Tandem ATP-Sepharose column (the lower column) chromatography of the 60-kDa liver protein. The eluted fractions from the DEAE-cellulose column were chromatographed on a tandem ATP-Sepharose column. The elution was carried out with 3 mM ATP.

After the protein was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, the digests were purified using a C18 reverse-phase column, which was connected to an HPLC. Fig. 4 shows a peptide map obtained from the 60-kDa liver protein. The seven peptides (numbers 36, 43, 54, 61, 64, 68, and 93) were sequenced by a protein sequencer (Fig. 5A). Peptide 61 had contained three peptides. The obtained 91 amino acid residues from the seven peptides have 96.9% homology to human HL-60 HSP60, the amino acid sequence of which was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA (14Jindal S. Dudani A.K. Singh B. Harley C.B. Guputa R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2279-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Deblocking of the blocked protein was performed, and the NH2 terminus of the protein was sequenced (Fig. 5A). The obtained 5 residues coincided with the signal sequence of human HL-60 HSP60 (14Jindal S. Dudani A.K. Singh B. Harley C.B. Guputa R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2279-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The homology of the partial amino acid sequences and the molecular mass led to the conclusion that the 60-kDa liver protein is the chaperonin homolog (HSP60). On the contrary, the intact NH2 terminus of the liver mitochondrial HSP60 could be sequenced (Fig. 5B). The signal sequence was lacking in the protein.Fig. 5Sequence alignment of the 60-kDa liver protein and human HL-60 chaperonin homolog. The seven purified peptides of lysyl endopeptidase digests (#36, #43, #54, #61, #64, #68, and #93) or the NH2 terminus of the protein (A), and porcine liver mitochondrial HSP60 (B) were sequenced and compared with human HL-60 chaperonin homolog. Identical residues are denoted by a dash. Parentheses indicate the position of human chaperonin homolog.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the isoelectric point of the chaperonin homolog, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out. The purified chaperonin homolog, bovine brain HSP73, and porcine liver GRP78 were co-electrophoresed, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 6). The results showed microheterogeneity of the chaperonin homolog (five spots); the pI values of chaperonin homolog and HSP73 were approximately the same, 5.6 for chaperonin homolog and 5.8 for HSP73, but they were distinct from the value for GRP78, 5.2. When DHFR is preincubated, in the absence of a substrate, with a 2-fold molar excess of chaperonin homolog, a slow time-dependent loss of DHFR activity is subsequenced observed (Fig. 7, tracesb-e). DHFR ligands are unable to prevent unfolded DHFR from interacting with chaperonin homolog upon dilution from guanidine hydrochloride (Fig. 7, tracea). Native DHFR interacted with chaperonin homolog, but only in the absence of substrates. These results were approximately the same as those for groEL (29Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The antibody against the purified liver chaperonin homolog was cross-reacted only with the 60-kDa protein in the liver crude extracts (Fig. 8B). The antibody is highly specific for the antigen. Porcine livers were subcellularly fractionated as described previously (22Itoh H. Tashima Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the purities of four subcellularly fractions were checked by measuring marker enzymes or DNA. Each sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the immunoblotting method using anti porcine liver chaperonin homolog antibody. Chaperonin homolog was detected not only in the mitochondrial fraction but also in the nuclear and cytosol fractions. The present experiments did not confirm its presence in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 8B, lanes1-4). The antibody against synthetic peptide corresponding to the signal peptide of HSP60 was cross-reacted with the 60-kDa protein in the cytosol and the purified chaperonin homolog (Fig. 8C). Although the immunoreactivity was extremely weak, the purified liver chaperonin homolog and the 60-kDa protein in subcellular fractions were detected on the immunoblotting method using an anti-Y. enterocolitica HSP60 monoclonal antibody, which cross-reacts with groEL, various bacteria, and mammalian HSP60 (Fig. 8D). These results indicated that mammalian chaperonin homolog exists both in the mitochondria and cytosol. To elucidate the physiological roles of chaperonin homolog, the localization of chaperonin homolog in the normal rat liver was studied using the antiserum against the porcine liver chaperonin homolog (Fig. 9A). This antibody was cross-reacted with from human liver chaperonin homolog to groEL as well as porcine liver chaperonin homolog in the immunoblotting method (data not shown). In normal rat livers, chaperonin homolog was detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 9A). To determine the localization of chaperonin homolog in the kidneys, electron microscopic immuno-histochemistry was performed. Chaperonin homolog was detected both in the mitochondria and cytoplasm (Fig. 9B). Based on the result shown in Fig. 8, the positive reactions in the cytoplasm are responsible for the presence of chaperonin homolog in the mitochondrial and cytosol fractions. We have identified and characterized constitutively expressed stress protein, chaperonin homolog, in porcine liver. The following evidence allows us to conclude that the 60-kDa protein purified from the livers is identical to chaperonin homolog: (i) subunit molecular mass of 60 kDa on SDS-PAGE; (ii) high homology (96.9%) of partial amino acid sequences (96 residues) between the liver protein and human HL-60 chaperonin homolog sequence of which was deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA; (iii) the sequence (5 residues) was coincided with the signal sequence of human HL-60 HSP60; (iv) DHFR can form a stable complex with the 60-kDa protein; (v) the liver protein was cross-reacted with the antibody against synthetic peptide corresponding to the signal peptide of HSP60. For the purification of chaperonin homolog, tandem ATP-Sepharose column chromatography was very effective. It was interesting that the protein was eluted as a major protein from the lower ATP-Sepharose column, in spite of the elution of chaperonin homolog from the upper ATP-Sepharose column as a minor protein; the protein was rather selectively retained in the lower ATP-Sepharose column. These phenomena were observed in the purification of the protein from bovine brain. The reason why chaperonin homolog binds selectively to the lower column is obscure. We speculate that some proteins in the crude fractions might interfere with the binding of chaperonin homolog in the case of the upper ATP-Sepharose column. We are searching for such interesting molecules. Mizzen et al.(16Mizzen L.A. Chang C. Garrels J.I. Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20664-20675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also reported the low affinity of HeLa cell mitochondrial HSP60 and the high affinity of HSP72 for ATP-Sepharose (16Mizzen L.A. Chang C. Garrels J.I. Welch W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20664-20675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They used Triton X-100 and sodium deoxycholate in the extraction buffer. The detergents may reduce the binding affinity of mitochondrial HSP60 to the gel. The present purification method is simple and highly reproducible, and its recovery is high. The method was available for chaperonin homolog from various mammalian organs including brains. Chaperonin homolog showed a pI value of 5.6 on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The microheterogeneity of chaperonin homolog might be dependent on phosphorylation or charge heterogeneity. Native DHFR can form a stable complex with chaperonin homolog as those for groEL (29Viitanen P.V. Donaldson G.K. Lorimer G.H. Lubben T.H. Gatenby A.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9716-9723Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, in this case, complex formation is not instantaneous and can be prevented by the presence of DHFR substrate. As a result, most of the native enzyme can eventually be sequestered on the chaperonin in a native form. This might imply that chaperonin homolog can recognize certain protein species that possess considerable secondary and tertiary structure. The biochemical properties (molecular mass, pI, affinity for ATP-Sepharose, and chaperonin activity) of chaperonin homolog were very similar to those of bacterial groEL protein. We obtained the monospecific polyclonal antibody against porcine chaperonin homolog. The antibody was cross-reacted with chaperonin homologs from human to E. coli (GroEL). Chaperonin homolog was detected in the cytosol and nuclear fractions as well as in the mitochondrial fraction on immunoblotting method. The data were supported by immunoblotting using an antibody against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the signal sequence of HSP60 and an anti-Y. enterocolitica HSP60 monoclonal antibody. The concentration of chaperonin homolog in the cytosol fraction was almost the same as that in the mitochondrial fraction and less in the nuclear fraction. Chaperonin homolog was also detected both in the cytoplasm and mitochondria on electron microscopic immunohistochemistry. These results suggested that chaperonin homolog, which may be induced in the cytosol, may be transported into mitochondria, and the protein may be converted into a mature form (mitochondrial HSP60) in the organella. HSP60 has no typical nuclear-localization signal like a PKKKRK. However, it was detected in the nuclear of normal rat liver in the present study. The mechanism of transferring into the nuclei is under experiment. It was reported that a small fraction of HSP60 is located in the cell membranes (33Fish P. Malkovsky M. Kovats S. Sturm E. Braakman E. Klein B.S. Voss S.D. Morrisey L.W. DeMars R. Welch W.J. Bolhuis R.L.H. Sondel P.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) or localized in the nucleus of a fish cell line (34Sanders B.M. Nguyen J. Douglass T.G. Miller S. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These results seem to suggest that HSP60 plays some important roles not only in the mitochondria but also in the cytosol, nuclei, and cell membranes. In the present report, we present evidence that mammalian chaperonin homolog possesses an ATP binding activity and chaperonin activity and localizes in nuclear, mitochondria, and cytosol. These findings represent the first demonstration of characterization of a mammalian chaperonin homolog and may help understand its function in normal and stressed cells, especially in intracellular protein folding and sorting.

Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and stop codon suppression (5Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Brault V. Miller W.A. Virology. 1992; 187: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The genomic RNA of luteoviruses is about 5.7 kilobases long and is not polyadenylated (6Mayo M.A. Barker H. Robinson D.J. Tamada T. Harrison B.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1982; 59: 163-167Crossref Google Scholar, 7Miller W.A. Waterhouse P.M. Gerlach W.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6097-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The genes in the 5′-half of the genome are translated directly from genomic RNA, whereas the 3′-half is expressed via subgenomic mRNA(s) (5Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Brault V. Miller W.A. Virology. 1992; 187: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 8Miller J.S. Mayo M.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Kelly L. Gerlach W.L. Waterhouse P.M. Virology. 1994; 202: 565-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The luteoviruses, including the barley yellow dwarf viruses (BYDVs),1( 1The abbreviations used are: BYDVbarley yellow dwarf virusUTRuntranslated regionSTNVsatellite tobacco necrosis virusntnucleotide(s)GUSβ-glucuronidaseTEtranslation enhancerBMVbrome mosaic virus.) have been classified into subgroups I and II, according to genome organization and other biological properties (1Miller W.A. Webster R.G. Granoff A. Encyclopedia of Virology. Academic Press, London1994: 792-798Google Scholar, 2Miller W.A. Paul C.P. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Crit. Rev.

The 5′-halves of the genomes of the two subgroups are essentially unrelated, whereas the 3′-halves of all luteoviruses have significant homology, with the exception of the approximately 800 3′-terminal bases of subgroup I genomes which are absent in subgroup II luteoviruses. The 5′-half of the genome of BYDV-PAV, a member of subgroup I, encodes a 39-kDa protein (39K ORF) and an overlapping open reading frame (60K ORF) which has the conserved amino acid motifs shared by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (6Mayo M.A. Barker H. Robinson D.J. Tamada T. Harrison B.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1982; 59: 163-167Crossref Google Scholar). This 60K ORF is expressed via a −1 ribosomal frameshift at the end of the 39K ORF to produce a 99-kDa protein (Fig. 1A) (3Brault V. Miller W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2262-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 4Di R. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Miller W.A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).The 5′ termini of eukaryotic cellular mRNAs have a cap structure (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)N) (12Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1976; 9: 645-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 13Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while the 5′ termini of viral RNAs can be either capped, uncapped (14Moss B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or covalently linked to a viral protein (VPg) (15Daubert S.D. Bruening G. Maramorosch K. Koprowski H. Methods in Virology. Academic Press, Orlando1983: 347-380Google Scholar). Genomes of viruses with any of these structures can have sequences near the 5′ end that enhance translation. For example, the 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs) of naturally capped RNAs of tobacco mosaic virus (16Sleat D.E. Wilson T.M.A. Wilson T.M.A. Davies J.W. Genetic Engineering with Plant Viruses. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 55-113Google Scholar), alfalfa mosaic virus (17Jobling S.A. Gehrke L. Nature. 1987; 325: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and potato virus X (18Tomashevskaya O.L. Solovyev A.G. Karpova O.V. Fedorkin O.N. Rodionova N.P. Morozov S.Y. Atabekov J.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and of VPg-linked viral RNAs such as tobacco etch virus (19Carrington J.C. Freed D.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the picornaviruses (20Pelletier J. Sonenberg N. Nature. 1988; 334: 320-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar) all stimulate translation by a variety of mechanisms. Although a VPg is attached to the 5′ termini of subgroup II luteoviral genomes (6Mayo M.A. Barker H. Robinson D.J. Tamada T. Harrison B.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1982; 59: 163-167Crossref Google Scholar, 21Murphy J.F. D'Arcy C.J. Clark J.M.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 2253-2256Crossref Google Scholar), the chemical nature of the 5′ terminus of BYDV-PAV and other subgroup I luteoviruses has not been reported.The 3′-UTRs of eukaryotic mRNAs can also regulate initiation of translation (22Jackson R.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 9-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 23Gallie D.R. Kobayashi M. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 142: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A ubiquitous 3′-UTR sequence that enhances translation initiation is the polyadenylate sequence (poly(A) tail) of 30 to 200 adenosine residues at the 3′ termini of most eukaryotic mRNAs (24Jackson R.J. Standart N. Cell. 1990; 62: 15-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 25Munroe D. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3441-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 26Munroe D. Jacobson A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 27Gallie D.R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Other sequences can functionally substitute for a poly(A) tail. For example, the pseudoknot-rich portion of the 3′-UTR of tobacco mosaic virus RNA, which is not polyadenylated, enhances the translation efficiency in vivo(28Gallie D.R. Walbot V. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The 5′ cap and this pseudoknot-rich domain or a poly(A) tail stimulate translation synergistically (27Gallie D.R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2108-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In the case of satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV), which has an uncapped, nonpolyadenylated, 1239-nucleotide (nt) RNA genome (14Moss B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 74: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 29Ysebaert M. van Emmelo J. Fiers W. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 143: 273-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the 3′-UTR facilitates cap-independent translation in vitro of its coat protein gene or heterologous genes in the presence of the viral 5′-UTR (30Danthinne X. Seurinck J. Meulewaeter F. van Montagu M. Cornelissen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3340-3349Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Timmer R.T. Benkowski L.A. Schodin D. Lax S.R. Metz A.M. Ravel J.M. Browning K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9504-9510Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that BYDV-PAV genes are translated cap-independently in wheat germ extracts. A sequence of at most 500 bases, located between 4.5 and 5 kilobases from the 5′ end of the viral genome, stimulates translation of viral or heterologous reporter genes from uncapped RNA by 30- to over 100-fold. This cap-independent translation may also depend on the presence of a portion of the 5′ end of the viral genome. This report should further our understanding of interactions between mRNAs and eukaryotic translation machinery.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of Internal Deletion MutantsDNA manipulations were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All plasmids were cloned in Escherichia coli (strain DH5αf′) except when BclI was used to digest the DNA, in which case plasmids were prepared in dam− strain GM33. Restriction sites discussed below are numbered by the base position in the BYDV-PAV genome (7Miller W.A. Waterhouse P.M. Gerlach W.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6097-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). pAGUS1 (33Skuzeski J.M. Nichols L.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was a gift from J. Skuzeski, now at Oregon State University.Construction of a full-length clone (pPAV6), from which infectious BYDV-PAV genomic RNA can be transcribed in vitro, was described previously (4Di R. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Miller W.A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To make pPAVM1, pPAV6 was digested with EcoRI to remove the EcoRI2860-EcoRI4148 fragment and religated. The same strategy was used to make pPAVM2, in which the BamHI1741-BamHI4837 fragment was deleted from pPAV6. To construct pSPM, pPAV6 was first digested with ScaI which cuts at base 4513 in the BYDV-PAV cDNA genome and in the ampicillin resistance gene in the vector. The resulting 5.5-kilobase fragment was purified by 1% low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis and digested with PmlI, and this ScaI(in the vector)-PmlI1112 fragment was ligated with ScaI(in the vector)-ScaI4513 fragment to give rise to pSPM in which the PmlI1112-ScaI4513 fragment was deleted from the BYDV-PAV genome. To delete the BalI578 to ScaI4513 region of the genome, pPAV6 was digested with these enzymes and religated. After gel purification, the BalI578-ScaI4513 fragment was discarded, and the remaining two fragments were ligated to give rise to pBS6.Construction of BYDV-PAV/GUS Chimeric RNAThe E. coli uidA gene which encodes β-glucuronidase (GUS) was cloned from NcoI-EcoICR I-digested pPAGUS1 (33Skuzeski J.M. Nichols L.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) into similarly cut pGEM5Zf(+) (Promega) to give rise to pT7GUS1. To construct pT7GUS3′-d2, the ScaI(in the vector)-ScaI4513 fragment of pPAV6 was cloned into EcoICR I-linearized pT7GUS1.pCIGUS was made so that the GUS coding sequence was flanked by the 5′-terminal 169 nt of BYDV-PAV RNA at its 5′ end and bases 4513-5677 in its 3′-UTR. We started with clone pPAVGUSRT8 (34Dinesh-Kumar, S. P., 1993, Gene Expression Strategies of Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus, Ph.D. Dissertation, Iowa State University.Google Scholar) which contains the GUS gene including an upstream multiple cloning site from pAGUS1 (33Skuzeski J.M. Nichols L.M. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1990; 15: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) inserted between base 3477 and the ScaI4513 site in pPAV6. pPAVGUSRT8 was digested with Eco47 III169 and Bsp120 I (codon 5 of the GUS ORF), made blunt-ended with T4 polymerase, and religated to produce pCIGUS. In pCIGUS, the entire 5′-UTR and the first nine codons of the GUS coding sequence were derived from the first 169 nt of BYDV-PAV RNA. The ScaI site was destroyed in the process, so pCIGUS was linearized at a unique EcoICR I site in the GUS-derived portion of the 3′-UTR to generate transcripts lacking viral sequences in the 3′-UTR.pT7GUSA(+) was constructed to add a poly(A) tail to the GUS 3′-UTR. pT7GUS1 was first digested with SmaI and ScaI. Then the fragment containing the GUS gene was gel-purified and ligated to SmaI-ScaI-digested pSP64poly(A) (Promega), which has a run of 30 adenosine residues between the SmaI and EcoRI sites in its multiple cloning site. pGUSEA1 was made by cloning the PstI-EcoICR I fragment of pCIGUS that spans the T7 promoter, the first 169 nt of BYDV-PAV genomic RNA, and the GUS coding region into pSP64poly(A) cut with the same enzymes.In Vitro Transcription and TranslationCapped and uncapped RNAs were prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the linearized plasmids using the Ambion Inc. mMessage mMachine® and MegaScript® kits, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. An 8:1 ratio of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G:GTP was used in reactions to produce capped transcripts. The integrity of all the transcripts was ascertained by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the concentration of the RNA was determined spectrophotometrically.Translation in vitro was carried out with 8 ng/μl capped or uncapped transcripts as mRNAs in a wheat germ extract in the presence of 0.34 μM [35S]methionine (1,175 Ci/mmol) in 25-μl reactions for 1 h as described by the manufacturer (Promega) or in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) as described previously (5Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Brault V. Miller W.A. Virology. 1992; 187: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), except where indicated. 35S-Labeled polypeptides were resolved by loading one-fifth of the in vitro translation reaction mixture on a 5% stacking and 10% resolving polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresis using a discontinuous buffer system (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). After the gel was fixed in a 25% ethanol, 10% acetic acid solution overnight, it was prepared for fluorography by shaking in 20 volumes of dimethyl sulfoxide, twice, each for 30 min. Then the gel was treated by gentle shaking in a 20% (w/v) solution of 2,5-diphenyloxazole in dimethyl sulfoxide. After the gel was soaked in water with shaking for 30 min and dried, radioactivity was visualized and digitized by exposure to a PhosphorImager 400E (Molecular Dynamics). Radioactivity was quantified using Imagequant 3.22 software (Molecular Dynamics). Thus, the “relative units” of radioactivity used in this manuscript are arbitrary.RNA Stability Assay1-2 pmol of uncapped transcripts from SmaI5677- or ScaI4513-linearized pPAV6 were incubated in the wheat germ extract in the translation conditions (above). At indicated time points, 5-μl aliquots were removed. RNA was extracted with phenol using an aurin tricarboxylate buffer followed by lithium chloride precipitation as described by Wadsworth et al.(36Wadsworth G.J. Redinbaugh M.G. Scandalios J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and modified by Seeley et al.(37Seeley K.A. Byrne D.H. Colbert J.T. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The final ethanol-precipitated RNA pellet was resuspended in 10 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. 5 μl of this RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel for Northern blot hybridization. The conditions used for probe labeling and Northern hybridization were described previously (5Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Brault V. Miller W.A. Virology. 1992; 187: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The probe was 32P-labeled RNA, complementary to BYDV-PAV bases 2737-2985, derived by in vitro transcription of EcoICR I-linearized pSP9 (5Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Brault V. Miller W.A. Virology. 1992; 187: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of a Sequence That Allows BYDV-PAV RNA to Be Translated Efficiently in the Absence of a 5′-m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G Cap StructureTo ensure that translation conditions were sensitive to changes in the translation efficiency of the RNA template (38Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Miller W.A. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 679-692PubMed Google Scholar), a subsaturating mRNA concentration of 8 ng/μl (4 nM for full-length BYDV-PAV RNA) was used in the translation reactions (4Di R. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Miller W.A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). RNAs containing a guanosine 5′-triphosphate or a m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G-cap were transcribed from pPAV6 templates linearized with SmaI5677, BclI5190, PstI5009, ScaI4513, or KpnI4154 and translated in the wheat germ extracts under previously optimized conditions (4Di R. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Miller W.A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Despite its anomalously slow mobility and occasional appearance as a doublet, the prominent band was shown previously to be the product of the 39K ORF (4Di R. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Miller W.A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 40Young M.J. Kelly L. Larkin P.J. Waterhouse P.M. Gerlach W.L. Virology. 1991; 180: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because the vast majority of incorporated [35S]methionine was in the 39-kDa polypeptide, the translation efficiency was defined as the amount of radioactivity incorporated in this protein as measured with a PhosphorImager.The amount of 39-kDa translation product from all capped transcripts varied less than 3-fold, regardless of the 3′ truncation (, Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, uncapped transcripts containing bases up to and 3′ of base 5009 (PstI site) yielded one-third to one-half as much 39-kDa product as their capped counterparts, but those which contained larger 3′ truncations, i.e. lacked bases 3′ of nucleotide 4513 (ScaI site), yielded 30- to 50-fold less 39-kDa product (Table I; Fig. 1B, lanes 10 and 12) than either their capped forms or the larger, uncapped transcripts. Thus, the translation of viral RNA was nearly cap-independent when transcribed from viral cDNA digested with SmaI, BclI, or PstI. In contrast, translation of transcripts from pPAV6 linearized at the ScaI4513 or upstream sites was highly cap-dependent. Thus, a sequence between the ScaI4513 site and the PstI5009 site is at least in part responsible for efficient translation in the absence of a 5′ cap.Table IEffect of 3′ truncations on the cap dependence and yield of 39-kDa product from BYDV-PAV RNA transcriptsTable IEffect of 3′ truncations on the cap dependence and yield of 39-kDa product from BYDV-PAV RNA transcriptsThese experiments also revealed that a more distal portion of the genome appears to be required for efficient −1 ribosomal frameshifting. As reported previously (4Di R. Dinesh-Kumar S.P. Miller W.A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the 99-kDa product of ribosomal frameshifting can be seen clearly among the translation products of full-length (SmaI-linearized) transcript (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). However, transcripts truncated at the BclI5190 site gave less frameshift product, and those with larger deletions yielded no frameshift products at all (Fig. 1B, lanes 7-12). Thus, sequences near the 3′ end of the genome are required for efficient frameshifting at bases 1152-1158. This remarkable phenomenon was unaffected by capping and it will be discussed in a separate publication.To further define the sequence(s) necessary for cap-independent translation, transcripts synthesized from internal deletion mutants and linearized with various restriction enzymes were translated in wheat germ extracts (Fig. 2). Mutants containing any deletions between the BalI578 and ScaI4513 sites were still translated cap-independently, if the transcripts were synthesized from PstI- or SmaI-linearized templates (Fig. 2). Cap-independent translation was abolished in transcripts linearized at BamHI4837 (Fig. 2). Transcripts synthesized from SmaI- and PstI-linearized pPAVM2, in which the sequence immediately 5′ of BamHI4837 was deleted, also failed to permit cap-independent translation. We conclude that (i) no sequences from the BalI578 to ScaI4513 sites and from PstI5009 to the 3′ end of the genome (SmaI5677) are required for cap-independent translation, (ii) the regions from ScaI4513 to BamHI4837 or BamHI4837 to PstI5009 alone were insufficient, and (iii) reducing the spacing between the ScaI-PstI region and the 5′ end of the genome did not reduce cap-independent translation. Thus, a region of the RNA between bases 4513 and 5009 is required for BYDV-PAV RNA to be translated independently of the presence of a 5′-m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap. We define the required ScaI4513 to PstI5009 region as a 3′ translation enhancer (3′-TE). In the following experiments, the transcripts having intact 3′-TE are called 3′-TE(+), whereas transcripts having no, or an incomplete 3′-TE, are 3′-TE(-).Fig. 2Effect of deletions in BYDV-PAV transcripts on cap-independent translation. Schematic diagram of BYDV-PAV cDNA clones with internal deletions and corresponding transcripts from these clones after linearization with various restriction enzymes. Bold lines below genome organization represent transcribed RNAs containing deletions indicated by the dotted lines. Deletion and 3′ truncation sites correspond to the restriction endonuclease sites indicated below genome organization. The dependence of each transcript on a 5′ cap for efficient translation is indicated at the right. “+” indicates that the translation efficiency (yield of product from 39K ORF or its deleted forms) of uncapped transcripts is no more than 3-fold lower than that of their capped counterparts, and 30-50-fold higher than that of uncapped transcripts indicated by “-.”“-” also indicates that the translation efficiency of uncapped transcripts is 30-50-fold lower than that of their capped counterparts. The 3′-TE is shaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of Conditions for Cap-independent TranslationThe reduced amount of 39-kDa product from uncapped, 3′-TE(-) transcripts could result from (i) a sequence-specific difference in optimal ionic conditions for in vitro translation, (ii) sharply decreased stability of the transcript, (iii) inactivation of critical factor(s) involved in translation in the wheat germ extract due to unknown reasons, or (iv) a decreased level of translatability of the transcript. These possibilities were tested. Because different mRNAs can have different optimal potassium ion concentrations (38Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2828Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 41Kemper D. Stolarsky L. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5676-5680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), these concentrations were varied. At all potassium ion concentrations, uncapped, 3′-TE(-) transcripts gave extremely low amounts of 39-kDa product which was about 25- to 50-fold less than that from uncapped 3′-TE(+) transcripts (data not shown). Thus, the extreme cap dependence of the 3′-TE(-) transcripts could not be compensated for by changes in ionic conditions.To test the second possibility that 3′-TE(-) transcripts were much less stable than 3′-TE(+) transcripts, their stabilities in the translation reaction were assessed by Northern blot hybridization. Approximately 50% of the transcripts from pPAV6 linearized with either ScaI (3′-TE(-)) or SmaI (3′-TE(+)) remained intact after 1 h of incubation in the wheat germ extract under our standard translation conditions (Fig. 3). Thus, the stabilities of 3′-TE(+) and 3′-TE(-) transcripts were indistinguishable.Fig. 3The 3′-TE does not affect transcript stability in wheat germ extracts. pPAV6 was linearized with SmaI or ScaI (Fig. 1A) prior to transcription. Transcripts were added to a standard wheat germ translation system as in Fig. 1, with aliquots being removed at indicated time points. Total RNA was extracted from the translation mixture and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization (see “Materials and Methods”). A, uncapped transcripts from SmaI-cut pPAV6. B, uncapped transcripts from ScaI-cut pPAV6. C, quantitation of transcripts as in A and B. Data represent averages of two and three experiments for SmaI-linearized (filled circles) and ScaI-linearized (open circles) transcripts, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the third possibility, that the absence of cap-independent translation in the uncapped, 3′-TE(-) transcripts was due to some kind of selective inactivation of the wheat germ translation system, translation of naturally capped brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNAs was observed in the presence of various BYDV-PAV transcripts. BMV RNA was translated with the same efficiency in the presence of capped or uncapped, 3′-TE(-) or 3′-TE(+) BYDV-PAV transcripts (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 6-9). Conversely, the presence of BMV RNA did not affect the translation of capped or uncapped, 3′-TE(-) or 3′-TE(+) transcripts (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and 6, 3 and 7, 4 and 8, and 5 and 9). Thus, there was no inhibition of the wheat germ translation machinery by the uncapped, 3′-TE(-) BYDV-PAV transcript. The lack of competition between BMV and BYDV-PAV RNAs verified that the mRNA levels were subsaturating and thus rate-limiting. All the above results taken together support the hypothesis that the 3′-TE acts to increase efficiency with which ribosomes and translation factors initiate translation of the uncapped viral transcript.Fig. 4Effect of capped and uncapped, 3′-TE(+) and 3′-TE(-) pPAV6 transcripts on translation of BMV RNA. The reactions are the same as in Fig. 1B, except that, in lanes 6-9, 0.1 μg of BMV RNA was added to the translation mixture.

Thus, we tested whether addition of free cap analog inhibited translation of 3′-TE(+) transcripts differently from 3′-TE(-) transcripts. As shown in Fig. 5, twice as much m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (27 μM) was required to achieve 50% inhibition of translation of uncapped, 3′-TE(+) transcript as was required for 50% inhibition of capped, 3′-TE(-) transcript (13 μM). Consistent with this, inhibition of translation of the transcript containing both a cap and 3′-TE falls in between. Although translation of capped transcripts was higher than uncapped 3′-TE(+) transcripts in these conditions (Table I), their sensitivity to inhibition by free cap analog was greater.Fig. 5Inhibition of translation by free cap analog.

The carboxyl-terminal half of Pγ is involved in interaction with Gαt as well as in inhibition of PDE activity. Here we have utilized a combination of synthetic peptide and mutagenesis approaches to localize specific regions of the carboxyl-terminal region of Pγ interacting with Gαt and Pαβ and have determined residues involved in inhibition of PDE activity. We found that synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 68-87 of Pγ completely inhibit trypsin-activated PDE. The peptide Pγ-63-87 bound to GαtGTPγS with a Kd of 2.5 μM, whereas the binding of Pγ-68-87 to GαtGTPγS was approximately 15-fold less (Kd= 40 μM) suggesting that carboxyl-terminal Pγ region 68-87 contains a site for interaction with Pαβ and also a part of the αt binding site. To map Gαt and Pαβ sites more precisely within the carboxyl-terminal region, a set of carboxyl-terminal mutants was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Deletion of residues 63-69 and 70-76 diminished the binding of mutants to αt while binding to carboxyl-terminally truncated mutants lacking up to 11 amino acid residues was unchanged. In contrast, carboxyl-terminal truncations of Pγ from Δ1 to Δ11 resulted in a gradual decrease of its inhibitory activity. Thus, the extreme carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic sequence -Ile86-Ile87 together with 9 adjacent residues provides inhibitory interaction of Pγ with Pαβ. The carboxyl-terminal GαtGTPγS binding site of Pγ is different from but adjacent to its PDE inhibitory site. During the visual transduction process, GαtGTP likely binds to this region of Pγ inducing a displacement of the extreme carboxyl terminus from the inhibitory site on Pαβ, leading to PDE activation.

This regulatory region is ubiquitously functional in mammalian cells, providing a high transcriptional potential. No cis-acting element responsible for the specificity of this gene expression was revealed by extensive studies using transient as well as stable expression systems. Here, we demonstrate that DNA methylation plays a key role in leukosialin gene expression. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNAs from various human cell lines with methylation-sensitive and -insensitive restriction enzymes showed a tight correlation between gene activity and demethylation state of the 5′-region of the leukosialin gene. Consistent results were obtained from the same analysis of genomic DNAs from various human tissues. In addition, in vitro DNA methylation of the 5′-region drastically reduced transcriptional activity in a transient expression system. These results indicate that DNA methylation around the 5′-region of the leukosialin gene is required to shut off a high level of transcription.

The norpA gene has been proposed to encode phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC), which enzymes play a pivotal role in one of the largest classes of signaling pathways known. A chimeric norpA minigene was constructed by placing the norpA cDNA behind an R1-6 photoreceptor cell-specific rhodopsin promoter. This minigene was transferred into norpAP24 mutant by P-element-mediated germline transformation to determine whether it could rescue the phototransduction defect concomitant with restoring PLC activity. Western blots of head homogenates stained with norpA antiserum show that norpA protein is restored in heads of transformed mutants. Moreover, transformants exhibit a large amount of measurable PLC activity in heads, whereas heads of norpAP24 mutant exhibit very little to none. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections using norpA antiserum confirm that expression of norpA protein in transformants localizes in the retina, more specifically in rhabdomeres of R1-6 photoreceptor cells, but not R7 or R8 photoreceptor cells. Furthermore, electrophysiological analyses reveal that transformants exhibit a restoration of light-evoked photoreceptor responses in R1-6 photoreceptor cells, but not in R7 or R8 photoreceptor cells.

PLC comprises a large family of enzymes. More than a dozen PLC-encoding genes have been identified and the cognate cDNAs cloned (see Meldrum et al., 1991Meldrum E. Parker P.J. Carozzi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 49-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar for references). The respective PLC enzymes have been classified into four major groups (designated PLC-α, PLC-β, PLC-γ, and PLC-δ) based on molecular weight, immunological, and structural differences (Rhee et al., 1989Rhee S.G. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Lee S.Y. Science. 1989; 244: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The PLC-β, -γ, and -δ enzymes have been further divided into subgroupings (PLC-β1 through PLC-β4, PLC-γ1 through PLC-γ2, and PLC-δ1 through PLC-δ3) based on differences in amino acid sequence and that each subtype is encoded by a separate gene (Meldrum et al., 1991Meldrum E.

Observations that the different subtypes of PLC differ in tissue distribution have led to the idea that they are coupled to different receptors and are utilized in different cellular processes (Rhee et al., 1989Rhee S.G.

Even for the PLC enzymes that have been purified or extensively characterized biochemically (Banno et al., 1986Banno Y. Nakanishi S. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

(Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the functions of the enzymes in vivo remain poorly described. A PLC enzyme for which a function in vivo has been proposed is encoded by the norpA gene of Drosophila melanogaster. Strong mutations in the norpA gene of Drosophila have long been known to abolish the light-evoked photoreceptor potential, rendering the fly blind (Hotta and Benzer, 1970Hotta Y. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar; Pak et al., 1970Pak W.L. Grossfield J. Arnold K. Nature. 1970; 227: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). norpA mutants have been shown to be deficient in PLC activity in head (Yohsioka et al., 1985), and molecular cloning of the norpA gene has shown that it encodes a protein that is similar in structure and amino acid sequence to vertebrate PLC (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T.

These data, as well as a growing body of evidence suggesting that PLC is involved in invertebrate phototransduction (reviewed by Payne, 1986Payne R. Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1986; 13: 373-397Google Scholar; Pak and Shortridge, 1991Pak W.L. Shortridge R.D. Photochem. and Photobiol. 1991; 53: 871-875Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), have converged to suggest that the norpA gene encodes PLC that is utilized in phototransduction in Drosophila. This is in contrast to vertebrate phototransduction which is proposed to occur via activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase (reviewed by Kaupp and Koch, 1986Kaupp U.B. Koch K.-W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 43-47Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (20) Google Scholar; Stryer, 1986Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1986; 9: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). To determine whether the norpA gene indeed encodes PLC activity that is required for phototransduction in Drosophila, we constructed a chimeric norpA minigene by fusing norpA cDNA to the ninaE gene promoter. Since ninaE gene encodes R1-6 photoreceptor cell-specific rhodpsin (O'Tousa et al., 1985O'Tousa J.E. Baehr W. Martin R.L. Hirsh J. Pak W.L. Applebury M. Cell. 1985; 40: 839-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar; Zuker et al., 1985Zuker C.S. Cowman A.F. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1985; 40: 851-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), its promoter will drive expression of norpA RNA in R1-6 photoreceptor cells. The norpA minigene chimera was transformed into norpAP24 mutant by P-element-mediated germline transformation (Spradling and Rubin, 1982Spradling A.C. Rubin G.M. Science. 1982; 218: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar; Rubin and Spradling, 1982Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C.

IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1986: 175-197Google Scholar). Transformed flies were examined to see whether the expression of the norpA protein in R1-6 photoreceptor cells is sufficient to rescue the phototransduction defect and the accompanying lack of PLC activity exhibited by norpA mutants. The D. melanogaster white (wA35) mutant was used in all experiments as a control group because its genetic background is most similar to norpAP24 mutant. norpAP24 mutants were chosen for transformation experiments because they are strong mutants which completely lack detectable amounts of norpA protein (Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and express severely reduced amounts of norpA mRNA as well (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flies were grown at 21°C in a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle on Carolina Instant Medium (Carolina Biological) supplemented with dry yeast or on cornmeal/sucrose/agar medium (Roberts, 1986Roberts D.B. Roberts D.G. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1986: 1-38Google Scholar) supplemented with β-carotene at 0.125 mg/ml. Separate experiments verified that Carolina Instant Medium has sufficient vitamin A to mediate normal vision (Lee, 1994Lee, R. D., 1994, The effects of carotenoid and retinoids upon Drosophila photoreception: Regulation of the expression of opsin, phospholipase C, Drosophila retinol binding protein, and membrane buildup, M. S. Thesis, St. Louis University.Google Scholar). One- to 4-day-old (after eclosion) adults were used for Western blot analysis, PLC activity assays, and immunohistochemistry. Four-day-old adults were used for most electrophysiological analyses although adults of various ages were also tested. Standard molecular biological techniques (Sambrook et al., 1989Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used to excise a 1.7-kilobase SpeI/BglI restriction fragment that contains the ninaE open reading frame from ninaE genomic DNA (O'Tousa et al., 1985O'Tousa J.E. Baehr W. Martin R.L. Hirsh J. Pak W.L. Applebury M. Cell. 1985; 40: 839-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The excised ninaE DNA fragment was replaced with a 3.8-kilobase BglI/SalI restriction fragment that contains the norpA open reading frame derived from the norpA cDNA (nucleotides 519-4331 in Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T.

Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) to create a chimeric ninaE/norpA minigene (Fig. 1). This norpA minigene chimera was subcloned into the pCaSpeR4 transformation vector (Thummel and Pirotta, 1991Thummel C.S. Pirotta V. Dros. Information Newsletter. 1991; Vol. 2Google Scholar) for transformation into the germline of norpAP24/white mutant using the procedure decribed by Spradling, 1986Spradling A.C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1986: 175-197Google Scholar. Surviving adults were crossed back to norpAP24 mutants. Transformed flies were identified in the progeny of this cross by their red eye color caused by expression of the mini-white gene which is contained within the pCaSpeR4 transformation vector. For identification of the insertion site of the norpA minigene chimera in the genome, chromosome squashes were prepared from salivary glands of transformed flies as described previously (Shortridge et al., 1991Shortridge R.D. Yoon J. Lending C. Bloomquist B.T. Perdew M. Pak W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12474-12480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the cDNA probe was prepared by labeling with digoxygenin-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) according to manufacturer's instructions. Visualization of the digoxygenin-labeled DNA after hybridization was by immunostaining in sheep anti-digoxygenin antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) followed by incubation with 0.4 mM 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride, and 0.4 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tissues from 0- to 4-day-old flies were homogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM KCl, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in 1.5-ml microfuge tubes using Teflon pestles. Homogenates were centrifuged briefly at 12,000 × g to remove particulate matter. These crude homogenates were fractionated by 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, stained using antiserum generated against the major gene product of norpA using conditions described by Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. PLC activity assays were carried out by incubating a 0.1 ml volume of 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10−7 M CaCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.2 mM phosphatidylinositol (Sigma), 44,000 disintegrations/min phosphatidyl-[3H]inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (New England Nuclear), and Drosophila tissue extract for 5 min at room temperature essentially as described Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Crude tissue extracts were prepared by grinding tissue in a buffer of 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 250 mM KCl, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 mM DTT, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, using a Teflon pestle in a 1.5-ml microfuge tube on ice. These homogenates were then centrifuged briefly at 12,000 × g to remove particulate matter. Protein concentration in homogenates were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) with BSA as a standard and an appropriate amount of extract (amount empirically determined to yield linear results with respect to time) added to the reaction mixture. Reactions were stopped by precipitating in 5% trichloroacetic acid and quantifying emissions in the supernatant by liquid scintillation. Drosophila heads were embedded in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek) and frozen on dry ice. Ten μm thick tissue sections were cut on a Reichert cryostat and transferred onto gelatin-subbed slides (Gall and Pardue, 1971Gall J.G. Pardue M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 21: 470-480Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The sections were fixed for 30 min in a freshly made solution of 150 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 75 μM lysine, 10 μM sodium metaperiodate, and 2% paraformaldehyde (McLean and Nakane, 1974). Following tissue fixation, sections were washed two times in PBS for 5 min each. The sections were blocked, incubated with antibodies, washed, and developed in the same way as Western blots mentioned above except primary antibody incubations were carried out overnight at 4°C. The primary antibody used in the immunohistochemical preparations was affinity purified from norpA antiserum by cross-linking a bacterially expressed norpA fusion protein (Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) according to manufacturer's instructions followed by passing the crude antiserum across the cross-linked beads packed loosely in a column. The column with bound antibodies was washed in 1 × PBS and the antibodies eluted in glycine-Cl buffer, pH 2.3 (Harlow and Lane, 1988Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Immunogold decoration of sites in photoreceptor cells that are stained by the norpA antiserum was carried out using minor modifications of the methods of Long et al., 1994Long J.J. Wang J.-L. Berry J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2827-2833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, flies were decapitated manually and the heads fixed overnight at 4°C in 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid, and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2. After rinsing in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, heads were incubated in a 0.5 M ammonium chloride, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, at room temperature for 1 h to block any remaining free aldehyde groups. The heads were washed twice in 50% ethanol and twice in 70% ethanol at room temperature for 5 min each to dehydrate the sample. Heads were then infiltrated and embedded with LR white resin (London Resin Company, Ltd., Hampshire, United Kingdom) according to manufacturer's directions. One-hundred-nm sections were prepared and placed on Formvar-coated nickel grids for immunolocalization. Grids were incubated in a blocking solution of 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 × PBS, supplemented with 2.5% normal goat sera for 15 min prior to incubation with affinity purified norpA antibody. Primary antibody staining was done by incubating the grid preparations for 30 min at room temperature in blocking solution containing affinity purified primary antibody at a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. Samples were washed four times for 30 min each in a washing solution of 0.5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 × PBS. Primary antibody was detected with a 1:20 dilution of 15 nm gold Auroprobe (Amersham) according to manufacturer's instructions. After washing the preparations in washing solution, as described above, the sample was stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Specimens were observed with an electron microscope (H500:Hitachi Ltd, Tokoyo) operating at 75 kV. Electroretinograms (ERGs) and prolonged depolarizing afterpotential (PDA) analyses were carried out on adult flies essentially as described by Chen et al., 1992Chen D.-M. Christianson J.S. Sapp R.I. Stark W.S. Vis. Neurosci. 1992; 9: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar. The fly's compound eye was carefully located at the focal plane of an optical stimulator using 625-nm light at an average intensity of 16.43 log quanta/cm2 × s. A glass micropipette was inserted into the retinal cell layer under 625-nm light. After the fly was dark adapted for 40 min, the eye was stimulated by 470-nm light and the ERG was recorded, amplified, and fed into a MacLab/2e-Macintosh LC II computer system for storage, viewing, and analysis. PDA was induced by two stimuli of 470 nm at about 16.04 log quanta/cm2 × s for 2 s each and followed by two of 570 nm stimulation at about 16.39 log quanta/cm2 × s for 2 s each. A chimeric norpA minigene was constructed by replacing the open reading frame of the Drosophila ninaE gene (O'Tousa et al., 1985O'Tousa J.E. Baehr W. Martin R.L. Hirsh J. Pak W.L. Applebury M.

Cell. 1985; 40: 851-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) with that of the norpA gene (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) such that expression of the norpA protein would come under control of the ninaE gene promoter (Fig. 1). Since the ninaE gene encodes the major form of rhodopsin in R1-6 photoreceptor cells, the expression of the norpA protein, derived from the chimeric minigene, should occur in the retina, more specifically in R1-6 photoreceptor cells. The chimeric norpA minigene was subcloned into the pCaSpeR4 transformation vector (Thummel and Pirrotta, 1991) and the resulting DNA injected into a total of 533 norpAP24 mutant embryos. Forty-five of the injected embryos developed into fertile adults, and of these, two different transformant lines were isolated (designated T-15 and T-35). To determine the position where the norpA minigene had inserted into the genome of the T-15 and T-35 transformant lines, labeled norpA cDNA was hybridized in situ to squashes of salivary chromosomes prepared from the transformants. The insertion site was at 46A in the T-15 transformant line and at 44A in the T-35 transformant, both on the right arm of the second chromosome (data not shown). Antiserum generated against the major gene product of norpA has been previously described (Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, norpA antiserum detects the 130-kDa norpA protein in head homogenates of the white strain (which is wild-type for norpA). This protein is missing in head homogenates of norpAP24 mutant, but is present in head homogenates of norpAP24 mutants after they have been transformed with the norpA minigene chimera. This 130-kDa protein is not detectable in head homogenates of white-eyed siblings of norpAP24 transformants (data not shown), which eye color indicates that the particular flies do not express the mini-white gene, and thus do not harbor norpA mini-gene inserts on their chromosomes. These data demonstrate that the norpA mini-gene chimera, when transformed into heads of norpAP24 mutant, is capable of directing the synthesis of norpA protein. Drosophila heads contain a high amount of PLC activity that is severely reduced by norpA mutations (Yoshioka et al., 1985Yoshioka T. Inoue H. Hotta Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 1251-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar; Inoue et al., 1988Inoue H. Yoshioka T. Hotta Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 103: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar; Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol.

Neuroscience. 1994; 61: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To determine whether PLC activity is rescued in heads of norpAP24 transformants, head homogenates were tested for their ability to cleave PIP2 in an in vitro activity assay. As shown in Fig. 3, norpAP24 mutants exhibit less than 1% of PLC activity that is measured in white strain (control) heads. The amount of PLC activity in white heads has been determined to be comparable to that found in wild-type heads.2( 2R. R. McKay, D-M. Chen, K. Miller, S. Kim, W. S. Stark, and R. D. Shortridge, unpublished results.) norpAP24 transformants exhibit 64% (T-15) and 27% (T-35) of the amount of PLC activity found in white heads (Fig. 3), demonstrating that the severe reduction of PLC activity exhibited by norpA mutants is capable of being at least partially reversed by transforming the norpA minigene chimera into the germline. To localize the expression of norpA protein in tissues, norpA antiserum was used to immunostain the norpA protein in tissue sections of heads. Since the expression of norpA RNA in transformants is driven by the ninaE gene promoter, which gene normally encodes R1-6 photoreceptor cell-specific rhodopsin (O'Tousa et al., 1985O'Tousa J.E. Baehr W. Martin R.L. Hirsh J. Pak W.L. Applebury M. Cell. 1985; 40: 839-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar; Zuker et al., 1985Zuker C.S. Cowman A.F. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1985; 40: 851-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), norpA protein would be expected to localize in retina, more specifically in R1-6 photoreceptor cells. In agreement with prior work (Zhu et al., 1993Zhu L. McKay R.R. Shortridge R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15994-16001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), norpA antiserum stains retina of white strain controls, but there is a definite lack of staining of retina of norpAP24 mutant (Fig. 4). The retina of norpAP24 mutants that have been transformed with the norpA minigene stain darkly by norpA antiserum, demonstrating that expression of the norpA minigene chimera occurs in the retina, as expected. To localize norpA expression at the subcellular level in retina, immunogold labeling of norpA protein in tissue sections of retina were visualized using electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5, staining of retina in transformants by norpA antiserum occurs over the rhabdomeres of R1-6 photoreceptor cells, but not R7 or R8 photoreceptor cells. This is what is expected, since the expression of norpA is being driven by the promoter of the ninaE gene, which gene encodes R1-6 photoreceptor cell-specific rhodopsin. ERG and PDA analyses were performed to determine whether transformants exhibit light-induced depolarizing responses in the retina. white mutant exhibits a normal ERG and PDA while norpAP24 mutant exhibits no ERG or PDA (Fig. 6). norpAP24 transformants indeed exhibit electrophysiological responses to light as measured by ERGs (Fig. 6), demonstrating that expression of the norpA minigene is sufficient to rescue the lack of light-induced photoreceptor response exhibited by norpAP24 mutant. ERG tracings of T-15 transformant resemble that of a wild-type response to light stimuli, while those of T-35 transformant take longer to return to base line after high intensity light stimulation than do wild-type or T-15 transformant (Fig. 6). There are no observable differences in ERGs between male, and females (data not shown). Moreover, ERG sensitivity does not appear to change with age (not shown). PDA tracings of both T-15 and T-35 transformants resemble that of control flies except that there is no or very little response induced by a second (blue light) or third (orange light) stimuli (Fig. 6). The observed responses to the second and third stimuli in control PDA tracings are known to be derived from depolarization of R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells (eg. Stark and Zitzmann, 1976Stark W.S. Zitzmann W.G. J. Comp. Physiol. 1976; 105: 15-27Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), indicating that the R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells are not functioning in transformants. These data correlate exactly with the immunohistochemical data, shown above, which demonstrate the presence of norpA protein in rhabdomeres of R1-6 photoreceptor cells, but its absence from R7 and R8 photoreceptor cells (Fig. 5). This finding was also expected, since the ninaE gene should drive expression of the norpA coding sequence only in R1-6 photoreceptor cells. norpA mutants have long been known to exhibit defects in vision and, more recently, it has been proposed that the norpA gene encodes a phospholipase C enzyme that is essential for phototransduction (Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar; Schneuwly et al., 1991Schneuwly S.

Photochem. and Photobiol. 1991; 53: 871-875Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The question addressed here is whether expression of norpA protein in mutants is sufficient to rescue the low amount of PLC activity in head of norpA mutant concomitant with rescuing the phototransduction defect. Indeed, our results show that expression of a norpA minigene in norpA mutant results in restoration of norpA protein in retina as well as a concomitant partial restoration of PLC activity and light-evoked responses of photoreceptor cells. This is the best evidence thus far supporting the hypothesis that the norpA gene encodes a PLC that is utilized in phototransduction. There are several possible explanations why expression of the norpA minigene in mutant fails to fully rescue 100% of the amount of PLC activity observed in wild-type retina. First, the ninaE promoter, which was used to drive the expression of norpA, targets expression only in a subset of photoreceptor cells while wild-type expression of norpA occurs in all of the photoreceptor cells of the compound eye and ocelli (eg. Schneuwly et al., 1991Schneuwly S. Burg M. Lending C. Perdew M. Pak W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24314-24319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the minigene was constructed by combining parts of two heterologous genes (ninaE and norpA), and this may have a drastic affect on amounts of viable RNA produced or amount of translated product that appears in photoreceptor cells. Third, position effects of the inserted DNA on the chromosome or presumptive changes occurring in the transposon during insertion into the genome may adversely affect efficiency of expression of the gene (Spradling, 1986Spradling A.C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1986: 175-197Google Scholar). Considering that any or all of these could lead to a reduction in the amount of norpA protein that is expressed in transformed mutants when compared to that in wild-type flies, the observed rescue is quite convincing. More importantly, the quantity of PLC activity exhibited by transformants appears to correlate well with the extent to which photoreceptor cells respond to light as well as the amount of norpA protein that appears to be present. The T-35 transformant exhibits less PLC activity than found in normal heads (27%) as well as less than T-15 transformant head (Fig. 3). This correlates well with results of the ERG analyses which show the response amplitude for T-35 transformant is less than that of white mutant or T-15 transformant under conditions of identical intensity stimulation (Fig. 6). Moreover, the amount of norpA protein in head of T-35 transformant, as judged by the darkness of staining of norpA protein in Western analyses, appears to be less than the amount in white heads or the T-15 transformant head (Fig. 2). Thus, there appears to be a positive correlation between reduction in PLC activity, reduction in the amount of norpA protein, and reduction in ERG amplitude of T-35 transformants, which results argue for a direct relationship between norpA protein, PLC activity, and photoreceptor cell responses. The significance of the present work is underscored by the fact that the norpA gene product is a PLC, a pivotal enzyme in one of the largest classes of signaling pathways known. Very little is known about the identity of signaling pathways that utilize any of the subtypes of PLC. The norpA-encoded PLC is one of the few for which a specific receptor and signaling pathway has been identified. Moreover, rescue of the phototransduction defect by expression of a norpA minigene proves that the gene identified by Bloomquist et al., 1988Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Steller H. Rubin G. Pak W.L. Cell. 1988; 54: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar is indeed the norpA gene as well as provides a means to carry out structure-to-function analyses on the norpA-encoded PLC. Alterations can now be made in norpA DNA prior to introducing it into the germline and the results can be examined in vivo. Furthermore, the significance of the conclusion that the norpA-encoded PLC is essential for phototransduction in Drosophila is strengthened by the recent identification of a bovine homologue of norpA that is found in the retina (Ferreira et al., 1993Ferreira P.A. Shortridge R.D. Pak W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6042-6046Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar; Lee et al., 1993Lee C.-W. Park D.J. Lee K.-H. Kim C.G. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21318-21327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This bovine retinal PLC has been shown to localize in the outer segments of cone cells, but not rods (Ferreira and Pak, 1994Ferreira P.A. Pak W.L J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3129-3131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inasmuch as the outer segments of cones are specialized structures for phototransduction, there might be an inositol phosphate-based phototransduction pathway in cones that is mediated by a norpA-like PLC (Ferreira and Pak, 1994Ferreira P.A. Pak W.L J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3129-3131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, further studies designed to elucidate the function of the norpA-encoded PLC in the Drosophila visual system may yield important clues needed to develop models of an analogous phototransduction process in mammals.

Post-translational glycosylation is now widely recognized as an important process for modifying the structure/function of eukaryotic proteins. Glycosylation additions in bacterial systems, however, are much less well understood and thus far restricted mainly to oligosaccharide polymers and lipopolysaccharides and to complex cell wall and cell surface components.

In the course of our studies on the hydrolases produced by Flavobacterium meningosepticum, we observed anomalies which suggested a type of glycosylation different from what had been previously observed in prokaryotes. This Gram-negative bacterium secretes into the culture medium at least eight major proteins that can be purified to homogeneity by hydrophobic interaction chromatography in conjunction with high-resolution ion-exchange chromatography (5Plummer Jr., T.H.

These proteins include two proteases, termed P27 and P401( 1The protease previously termed P45 with an apparent molecular weight of about 45,000 on SDS-PAGE has been renamed P40, because mass spectrometry confirmed a molecular weight of 40,086 daltons. P40 has since been identified as a zinc-aspartyl endoprotease (21Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Grimwood B.G. Hauer C.R. Plummer Jr., T.H. Arch. Biochem.

The genes for all four oligosaccharide chain-cleaving enzymes were cloned and their nucleotide sequences determined (8Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Trumble A. Changchien L.-M. Duceman B. Maley F.

The genes for Endo F2 and Endo F3 were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the molecular weights of the cloned enzymes were compared with those of the native enzymes on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Native Endo F3 ran slightly larger and native Endo F2 significantly larger than their cloned enzyme counterparts. Mass spectrometry confirmed that Endo F2 and Endo F3 were modified and contained approximately 3731 and 1244 daltons of mass, respectively, not accounted for in the gene structure. Re-examination of Edman sequence data led to the suggestion that Endo F2 and Endo F3 were post-translationally modified with carbohydrate during secretion by possible linkage to the hydroxyl of serine (10Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9702-9708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A problem existed in characterizing the oligosaccharide moieties of Endo F2 and Endo F3, since isolation of these enzymes from 12 liters of cultural filtrate yielded only 9 and 15 nmol of protein, respectively. We will demonstrate that the P40 protease is also a glycoprotein containing a carbohydrate moiety O-linked to serine at one unique well defined aspartyl-serine consensus site. This oligosaccharide is easily obtained in amounts of 1 μmol and serves as a model for Endo F2 and Endo F3. In fact, mass spectrometry data strongly suggests that the O-linked carbohydrate on P40, Endo F2, and Endo F3 are identical. peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase high performance anion-exchange chromatography/pulsed amperometric detection gas chromatography/mass spectrometry electrospray ionization collisional activated dissociation. Prokaryotic extracellular glycoproteins like Endo F2, Endo F3, and P40 that have O-linked oligosaccharides at specific consensus sites have never been described before. This report outlines the isolation of glycopeptides containing these consensus sites and demonstrates the existence of a new type of bacterial glycan that is distinguished by having an unusual array of uronic acids and methylated neutral sugars linked via mannose to serine/threonine.

Endo F2 and Endo F3 were isolated essentially as described (5Plummer Jr., T.H. Tarentino A.L. Glycobiology. 1991; I: 257-263Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The final purification step of Endo F2 and Endo F3 was achieved on a high resolution sulfopropyl (Protein-Pak SP8HR, Waters Chromatography Division) column at pH 4.5 (6Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). P40 was chromatographed on TSK-phenyl-Toyopearl 650 M(3Kärcher U. Schröder H. Haslinger E. Allmaier G.

Pooled fractions were dialyzed at 4°C against two changes of 10 mM EDTA and one change of 5 mM EDTA followed by one change of distilled water for 4 h before lyophilization. Lyophilized P40 (42 mg) was warmed at 37°C for 45 min in 1.6 ml of 0.4 M Hepes, pH 8.25, containing 8 M urea. The solution was diluted 3-fold with 4.8 ml of 0.4 M Hepes and 315 μl of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (4.0 mg/ml, 3% w/w) in 2 mM HCl, 100 mM CaCl2 was added. After 6 h, a second identical aliquot of trypsin was added. The digestion was incubated at 37°C for 24 h and was terminated by addition of 0.4 ml of 8 M H3PO4. A precipitate was removed by centrifugation. Lyophilized Endo F3 (1.23 mg) was suspended in 0.4 ml of 0.2 M Hepes, pH 8.24, containing 5 mM CaCl2; and 50 μg of thermolysin, 3% w/w, (Calbiochem) was added. After 6 h, a second identical aliquot of thermolysin was added. The digestion was incubated at 50°C for 24 h and was terminated by addition of 50 μl of 4.0 M H3PO4. To approximately 500 pmol of Endo F2 in a 500-μl Eppendorf tube was added 100 μl of 70% trifluoroacetic acid and a crystal of CNBr. The sample was flushed with N2, capped, and allowed to sit for 24 h at room temperature. The solution was lyophilized to near dryness, redissolved in 500 μl of water, lyophilized again, and then redissolved in 200 μl of water prior to separation on a 1 × 50-mm ABI RP-300 column. Supernatant (7.5 ml) from the tryptic digestion of P40 was applied to a column of Toyopearl HW-40S (1.5 × 234 cm, Supelco) equilibrated in 0.1 N acetic acid containing 1% butanol. The flow rate was 11.2 ml/h, and fractions of 2.8 ml were collected. Peptides were detected by absorbance at 230 nm. Carbohydrate was monitored by the phenol-H2SO4 assay (12DuBios M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (39410) Google Scholar). The glycopeptide was shown to be exclusively in the nonretarded position on the column. These fractions were pooled, concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40°C, and rechromatographed on a column of Bio-Gel P-4 (0.9 × 91 cm, 200-400 mesh, Bio-Rad) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 12 ml/h, and fractions of 0.8 ml were collected. Glycopeptide was detected by absorbance at 215 nm and by reacting aliquots with fluorescamine (13Udenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate was monitored as before and pertinent fractions were lyophilized. The supernatant from the thermolytic digestion of Endo F3 was handled identically to that of P40 except on a smaller scale. The initial separation was on a TSK HW40S column (0.6 × 93 cm) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 6.0 ml/h, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Peptides were monitored at 215 nm. The glycopeptide-containing fractions (tubes 28-30) were lyophilized. Ten percent was applied directly to a Bio-Gel P-4 column (0.6 × 63 cm) and 90% was subjected to alkaline-borohydride oligosaccharide release (see below) prior to chromatography on Bio-Gel P-4. Lyophilized P40 glycopeptide (1 μmol) was dissolved in 450 μl of freshly prepared 1 M NaBH4 in 50 mM NaOH (14Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated at 45°C. After 16 h, the reaction was terminated by the addition of glacial acetic acid to pH 4.0, and the sample was applied to the aforementioned larger Bio-Gel P-4 column. Uncleaved peptide, released oligosaccharide, and released peptide were detected as before. Endo F3 glycopeptide was handled similarly, and released oligosaccharide was separated from reduced peptide on a Bio-Gel P-4 column (0.6 × 63 cm). Peptides were hydrolyzed in constant boiling HCl at 110°C for 22-24 h and analyzed for amino acids with a Beckman System Gold amino acid analyzer or a Pickering amino acid resolution column and buffers on a Waters 625 LC system. Automated Edman degradation was performed with a model 477A Applied Biosystem pulsed liquid sequenator equipped with a model 120A amino acid analyzer. Samples of 250-2000 pmol were applied in 100-200 μl of 25% acetic or formic acid. Peptide composition determined by amino acid analysis was used to predict the number of Edman cycles to be completed for each peptide. Suitable aliquots were hydrolyzed either with 2 N trifluoroacetic acid or with 2 N hydrochloric acid in N2-flushed, evacuated tubes for varying time intervals. Acids were removed by lyophilization (2 N trifluoroacetic acid) or under vacuum at 40°C (2 N HCl). Monosaccharide samples were taken up in water (115 μl), made alkaline with 2 N NaOH (10 μl), and aliquots (100 μl) were analyzed by HPAEC/PAD on a CarboPac PA-I column, using the chromatography conditions of Clarke et al.(15Clarke A.J. Sarabia V. Keenleyside W. MacLachlan P.R. Whitfield C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), or on a MA-1 column using conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Dionex) for sugar alcohols. Released, reduced P40 oligosaccharide was chromatographed on a Carbo-Pac PA-100 column using the general procedure of Townsend et al.(16Townsend R.R. Atkinson P.H. Trimble R.B. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 215: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Eluant 1 was 500 mM sodium acetate, eluant 2 was water, and eluant 3 was 1 M NaOH. The column was equilibrated in 10 mM sodium acetate, 200 mM sodium hydroxide at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. After sample addition, the concentration of sodium acetate was increased to 400 mM over 60 min using a linear gradient. Compositional analyses were also accomplished by preparing alditol acetate derivatives of glycosyl components followed by gas chromatography and combined gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. Trimethylsilyl derivatives of the methyl glycosides were prepared to detect any amino sugars (17Merkle R.K. Poppe I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 18York W.S. Darrill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) and analyzed by GC and GC/MS (compositional analyses were performed by Dr. Roberta K. Merkle at the University of Georgia, Complex Carbohydrate Research Center). Data were acquired with a Finnigan-MAT (San Jose, CA) TSQ-700 triple quadruple mass spectrometer equipped with a Finnigan electrospray ionization (ESI) source. Salt-free samples were infused into the ESI source at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Collisional activated dissociation (CAD) spectra were obtained on doubly and/or singly charged ions; argon was used as the collision gas. Carboxylic acid groups were converted to the corresponding methyl esters as described previously (19Hunt D.F. Yates J.R. Shabanowitz J. Winston S. Hauer C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6233-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Peptide amine terminal NH2 groups were acetylated with a 3:1 mixture of methanol/acetic anhydride. The secreted proteins of Flavobacterium meningosepticum are separated initially by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on columns of either Toyopearl TSK-butyl (5Plummer Jr., T.H. Tarentino A.L. Glycobiology. 1991; I: 257-263Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or Toyopearl TSK-phenyl (7Grimwood B.G. Plummer Jr., T.H. Tarentino A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A typical chromatogram of 12 liters of culture medium on a TSK-phenyl column was surveyed for carbohydrate content by the phenol-H2SO4 assay. The only protein peak that was coincident with carbohydrate was that of the protease, P40 (peak C, Ref. 7Grimwood B.G. Plummer Jr., T.H. Tarentino A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The fractions containing Endo F2 and F3, although glycosylated, showed no carbohydrate owing to the lack of sensitivity of this technique at their concentration levels. P40 was rechromatographed on a column of TSK-butyl (not shown), desalted by dialysis against dilute EDTA, and then subjected to total tryptic hydrolysis. The soluble peptides, containing 80% of the original carbohydrate, were subjected to gel filtration on a column of TSK HW-40S (Fig. 1). All of the carbohydrate was recovered in a glycopeptide eluting in the nonretarded fraction of the column. Amino acid analysis of the glycopeptide indicated the presence of six amino acids, with 2 mol of serine/mol of aspartic acid and no apparent amino sugars. The glycopeptide was then subjected to alkaline borohydride to release the oligosaccharide moiety. After overnight incubation at 45°C excess borohydride was decomposed with glacial acetic acid, and the reaction mixture was separated on a Bio-Gel P-4 column (Fig. 2). All components were monitored by absorbance at 215 nm; the carbohydrate- and peptide-containing fractions were determined with phenol-H2SO4 and fluorescamine, respectively. The peak corresponding to the intact glycopeptide (Fig. 2, solid bar) was greatly decreased following alkaline borohydride treatment and replaced by two lower molecular weight fractions; a moderate-sized peak containing the majority of the carbohydrate (Fig. 2, CHO), and a large fluorescamine-positive, carbohydrate-negative peak containing the peptide. Molecular weight analysis by ESI-MS indicated a mass of 746.6 Da for the deglycosylated peptide. The CAD spectra of the native, acetylated, and methyl ester-converted peptide demonstrated a sequence of S-X-X-D-A-T-K, where X is either leucine or isoleucine. Edman degradation established that the sequence was S-I-L-D-A-T-K. The presence of 1 mol of alanine corresponds to the complete reduction of the dehydroalanine formed by β-elimination of the oligosaccharide moiety at the serine residue under the conditions employed. Thus, the P40 glycopeptide corresponds to the sequence S-I-L-D-S∗-T-K (Table I), where the starred serine represents the site of attachment to the oligosaccharide.Fig. 2Gel filtration of P40 glycopeptide mixture after release of oligosaccharide chain by 1 M NaBH4 in 50 mM NaOH at 45°C for 16 h. The column (0.9 × 91 cm) was equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 9 ml/h, and fractions of 0.8 ml were collected. Peptides were detected by absorbance at 215 nm (●) and by reaction of aliquots with Fluram (■); carbohydrate was monitored by the phenol-H2SO4 assay (○).

Mild acid hydrolysis of the free oligosaccharide followed by HPAEC chromatography on a PA-1 column indicated the presence of glucose, mannose, and glucuronic acid, plus at least two unknown components in significant amount. Sugar composition determined by GC and GC/MS analysis of the TMS and alditol acetate derivatives indicated the presence of mannitol, presumably the linking sugar of the oligosaccharide, and nearly equimolar amounts of a 2-O-methyl-deoxyhexose (probably rhamnose), 2-O-methyl mannose, glucose, and glucuronic acid, as well as lower amounts of mannose. The presence of mannitol was verified by HPAEC/PAD chromatography using a MA-1 column. No amino sugars were apparent using any of the above techniques. Mass analysis of the free oligosaccharide demonstrated a molecular weight of 1264 Da for the major component. An intense signal for the M + H+ ion, compared with Na+ and K+ chelated species, indicated the presence of a basic moiety in the oligosaccharide, in spite of the absence of amino sugars in the compositional analysis. The CAD spectrum of this oligosaccharide (Fig. 3A) exhibited a daughter ion series with prominent signals at m/z 218, 394, and 556; this daughter ion pattern was also observed in the CAD spectra of glycopeptides with the 1244-Da pendant group. Also, the m/z 218 signal indicated the possible presence of an N-acetylhexuronic acid, and the m/z 218 - m/z 394 difference of 176 indicated the possible presence of a hexuronic acid or a methyl hexose. To test for the presence of hexuronic acids the released oligosaccharide was treated with methanolic HCl, to convert any carboxylate groups into methyl esters. Molecular mass analysis of the resultant derivative indicated a mass of 1306 Da. This shift of 42 Da corresponds to the presence of three carboxylic acid groups in the P40 oligosaccharide. In Fig. 3B, the CAD spectrum of the methyl ester converted oligosaccharide, the shift of the m/z 218 ion to m/z 232 supports an assignment of N-acetylhexuronic acid, whereas the constant difference of 176 between the m/z 232 and m/z 408 ions argues for the presence of a methyl hexose as an adjacent sugar group. The reduced P40 oligosaccharide was chromatographed directly on a PA-100 column. Because of the three acidic groups in this oligosaccharide, it was necessary to increase the standard gradient sodium acetate concentration 2-fold in order to elute the oligosaccharide in the middle of the profile. Under these conditions the oligosaccharide was resolved into three glycoforms; a main component representing 83% of the PAD response, with minor components accounting for 14 and 3%, respectively. These findings are consistent with MS analyses that indicated a main component with a mass of 1264 Da, a minor component with a mass of 1104 Da (−160 Da), and a trace component with a mass of 1441 Da (+176 Da). Evidence has also been obtained that Endo F3 and Endo F2 are O-glycosylated like the P40 protease described above. A glycopeptide was isolated from Endo F3 using the same procedures developed for the P40 protease, albeit on a smaller scale. Intact enzyme was digested at 50°C by thermolysin, and the glycopeptide was isolated by gel filtration in the nonretarded fractions of a TSK-HW40S column. The glycopeptide was subjected to oligosaccharide release by alkaline-borohydride followed by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-4 to separate the components. Trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis of intact glycopeptide followed by HPAEC chromatography on a PA-1 column gave a pattern of unknown and known sugars very similar to that of the P40 oligosaccharide. Edman degradation of the carbohydrate-free peptide established the following sequence for the 10 cycles programmed: L-Q-D-X-T-K-L-P-G-G. The X represents a blank cycle which should contain phenylthiohydantoin-derivative amino-butyric acid, for which there was no standard. The sequence L-Q-D-T-T-K corresponds to residues 46-51 of the Endo F3 molecule (10Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9702-9708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry determined a molecular mass of 2431 Da for the glycopeptide. The CAD spectrum of this species was consistent with the peptide L-Q-D-T∗-T-K-L-P-G-G-T-G, modified, like the P40 protease, with a pendant moiety of mass 1244 Da. This MS/MS spectrum exhibited the characteristic daughter ion pattern of m/z 218, 394, 556 associated with the putative common Flavobacterium glycoform. The methyl ester converted sample exhibited a mass of 2501 Da, corresponding to the presence of five carboxylic acids (three on the oligosaccharide and two on the peptide chain), i.e. the expected value for this glycopeptide. The gene for Endo F2 has been isolated and cloned in E. coli(10Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9702-9708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of the molecular weights of native versus cloned Endo F2 showed a molecular weight difference of +3731 for the native enzyme, suggesting potential multiple glycosylation sites. Edman data of two tryptic peptides containing Asp-Ser sequences revealed no phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives for these serines. To account for the mass difference, we proposed (10Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9702-9708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that native Endo F2 was post-translationally modified during secretion by glycosylation with an oligosaccharide moiety at three specific serine residues in an Asp-Ser diad, namely at positions 27-28, 43-44, and 97-98. This proposal was confirmed by the following mass analysis. Cleavage of Endo F2 with cyanogen bromide followed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography separation on a RP-300 (C8) column yielded four distinct fractions. Infusion ESI mass analysis of one of these fractions revealed two nonglycosylated peptides, with respective molecular masses of 9482 (major product) and 9711 Da (minor product). These values coincide with the calculated masses for the projected cleavage products (as homoserine) at amino acid residues 206-288 and 206-290 of Endo F2. The three other CNBr fractions were glycosylated peptides with masses of 2327, 5369, and 18,460 Da, respectively. These values each correlate to predicted cleavage residue sites 39-47, 1-38, and 51-205 with the addition of a 1244-Da oligosaccharide moiety (Table I). For example, the CAD spectrum of the 2327-Da peptide is consistent with the glycopeptide sequence, R-W-L-P-D-S∗-L-D-Hse. Moreover, each glycopeptide fraction showed the characteristic oligosaccharide daughter ion series of m/z 218, 394 and 556. Table I represents a synopsis of sequences of F. meningosepticum secreted proteins and their sites of glycosylation. In every instance where there is a DS∗ sequence, the starred serine is fully substituted by addition of the common Flavobacterium oligosaccharide. We have found only one instance of a D-T∗-T sequence (Endo F3) and it too is fully substituted. A DT sequence alone, however, is not sufficient to allow for glycosylation, as evidenced by the finding that the single DT sequences in Endo F1, Endo F2, Endo F3, and P40 (Table I) do not contain covalently bound carbohydrate. These substitutions should be evident by MS analysis even if on less than 10% of the protein. It is of interest to note that all five nonsubstituted DT sequences are followed by asparagine, aspartic acid, or glutamine. Further sequence studies will reveal whether these residues could be a negative signal for glycosylation. The function of this novel oligosaccharide will require further study. The only other reported O-linked glycan on prokaryotes are those found in the extracellular cellulase complexes of Clostridium thermocellum and Bacteriodes cellulosolvens(4Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Morag E. Lamed R. Bayer E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26956-26960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These glycans are linked mainly to threonine via a galactosyl group, and the attachment sites appear to be restricted to threonine/proline enriched areas somewhat reminiscent of O-linked carbohydrates of eukaryotic systems. In contrast, the Flavobacterium oligosaccharide has a completely different glycan structure that is attached randomly at very specific consensus sites. The oligosaccharide moiety may be involved in protein folding/stability as has been demonstrated in mammalian systems. We have successfully used the pMAL amplification system for overproduction of PNGase F3( 3Conducted in collaboration with Dr. Chudi Guan, New England Biolabs.) and glycosylasparaginase (20Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Hauer C. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) in E. coli. Neither of these proteins is glycosylated by F. meningosepticum. In contrast, Endo F2 which is heavily O-glycosylated, is unable to be amplified in E. coli with the pMAL system despite being properly engineered into the vector. Endo F2 appears to be unstable without its normal carbohydrate complement in this system and is recovered in trace amounts. We anticipate the production of antibody probes to ascertain whether this oligosaccharide and its linkage sequence is unique to Flavobacterium, or importantly, is an unreported but more common glycoform in other secreted bacterial glycoproteins. We thank Arthur W. Phelan and William Heffernan for excellent technical assistance and Dr. Li-Ming Changchien for Edman sequence analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1972933266,"In this paper we describe the results of molecular modeling of the structures of the active sites of two subtilisin-like prohormone convertases (SPCs), SPC2 (PC2) and SPC3 (PC1/PC3). These enzymes are members of a recently discovered family of cellular proteases involved in the processing of precursor proteins. Although these proteases all possess catalytic domains similar to the bacterial subtilisins no tertiary structural data from x-ray analysis are yet available. We have shown that despite the high structural homology of the subtilisins and the SPCs, the structure of the loop which lies immediately below the active sites differs due to the presence of a cis-peptide bond (Tyr167-Pro168) in this loop in the subtilisins and its absence in the SPCs. Accordingly, we have proposed a new alignment for the amino acid sequences of the SPCs in this region. Both SPC2 and SPC3 participate in the processing of prohormones at dibasic cleavage sites, typically Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg. To investigate the structural basis of the substrate specificity of these SPCs, we have carried out molecular mechanic calculations of the optimal arrangement and interactions of peptide substrates containing several residues of arginine or lysine, i.e. Arg, Ala-Ala-Ala-Arg, Arg-Ala-Ala-Arg, Arg-Ala-Arg-Arg, Arg-Ala-Lys-Arg, in the putative active sites. Such subtilisin-based modeling has allowed us to identify those negatively charged residues, Asp and Glu, in the S1, S2, and S4 subsites, which can directly interact with basic residues in the substrates via formation of salt bridges and thereby contribute to the substrate selectivity of the SPCs.

Hatsuzawa K. Ikemizu J. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12127-12130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most prohormones on the other hand are cleaved at paired basic residue sites, primarily Lys-Arg or Arg-Arg. However, further analysis of sites cleaved in mouse AtT-20 cells, which contain SPC3 as their major endogenous protease, has revealed that, in addition to the foregoing sites, others consisting of Arg-X-X-Arg (R-X-X-R) are also cleaved (19Nakayama K. Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Kim W.-S. Nagahama M. Hosaka M. Hatsuzawa K. Koudoh-Hashiba K. Murakami K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16335-16340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a basic residue at position −4 relative to the scissible bond (P4) may play a very important role in enhancing substrate site selectivity of the SPCs generally, as is illustrated especially in the processing carried out by furin (20Molloy S.S. Bresnahan P.A. Leppia S.I. Klimpel K.R. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16396-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both furin and SPC3, and possibly also SPC2, catalyze the processing of protein and peptide precursors containing Arg-X-Lys/Arg-Arg or Arg-X-X-Arg cleavage sites in the constitutive and/or regulated exocytic pathways. When kexin was cloned and sequenced (7Mizuno K. Nakamura T. Ohshima T. Tanaka S. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), it was found to contain a catalytic domain that is homologous to that of the bacterial subtilisins. Amino acid sequence alignments of SPC2, SPC3, furin, and kexin showed a very high degree of similarity in their catalytic domains (4Smeekens S.P. Chan S.J. Steiner D.F. Prog. Brain Res. 1992; 92: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A.M. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The most significant difference between the subtilisins and the catalytic domains of the SPCs is the large increase in the number of negatively charged residues (Glu and Asp), relative to the subtilisins, which may contribute to the great selectivity of this family of enzymes for substrates containing paired basic residues (5Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Van de Ven W.J.M. Voorberg J. Fontijan R. Pannekoek M.

Although x-ray investigations of SPCs have not yet been carried out, molecular modeling of the catalytic domain of furin has indicated that it is closely related in its three-dimensional structure to the subtilisins (21Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A.M. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 22Van de Ven W.J.M. Voorberg J. Fontijan R. Pannekoek M.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This circumstance opens the way for molecular modeling and protein engineering of the SPCs on the basis of their homology with subtilisins. The three-dimensional structures of four subtilases have been established, subtilisin BPN′ (Novo) (25Wright C.S. Alden R.A. Kraut J.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), thermitase (29Gros P. Betzel C. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 347-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and proteinase K (30Betzel C. Pal G.P. Saenger W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The overall conformation of these enzymes is very similar (21Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A.M. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), especially in their active site regions (27McPhalen C.A. James M.N.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6582-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In molecular modeling the active sites of SPC2 and SPC3, we have used the x-ray data on subtilisins BPN′ and Carlsberg (27McPhalen C.A. James M.N.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6582-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The substrate-binding site of the subtilisins was identified by analysis of their crystalline complexes with inhibitors or inactive analogs of substrates (26Hirono S. Akagawa H. Mitsui Y. Iitaka Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 389-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27McPhalen C.A. James M.N.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6582-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The active site grooves of the subtilisins can bind at least 6 amino acid residues (P4-P2′)2( 2According to the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (31Schechter J. Berger A. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4776) Google Scholar), the scissible peptide bond is located between the P1 and P1′ substrate residues. Amino acid residues of the substrate are numbered P2, P3, P4, etc. toward the N terminus. The complementary subsites of the binding region of the enzyme are correspondingly numbered S1′, Sl, S2, S3, S4…) of peptide inhibitors and/or substrates. Residues forming the active sites of subtilisin BPN′ and Carlsberg are indicated in Table I. This information is taken from Ref. 27McPhalen C.A. James M.N.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6582-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, describing contacts of less than 4 Å between subtilisins and the peptide inhibitors eglin-c or chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. The presumptive residues at structurally equivalent positions in the catalytic domains of SPC3 and SPC2 are also given in Table I in accordance with the amino acid sequence alignment of known subtilases as proposed by Siezen et al.(21Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A.M. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In accord with our modeling results, we have included 3 additional amino acid residues because their side chains potentially interact with residues P1 and P4 of substrates: 165 in subsite S1, and 131 and 135 in subsite S4 of SPC3 and SPC2.Table IAlignment of amino acid residues in active site regions of subtilisins BPM′ and Carlsberg and SPCs (21Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A.M. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) However, we have noted a significant difference between the primary structures of the subtilisins and PCs that appears to be important in the structural organization of these proteins. In subtilases with known x-ray structures, a cis-peptide bond always occurs between residues 167-168 and in all cases residue 168 is proline, as is usually the case following this kind of bond (32Stewart D.E. Sarkar A. Wampler J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Moreover, in dipeptide fragments of the type Tyr-Pro (Tyr167-Pro168 in the subtilisins), cis-peptide bonds predominate (32Stewart D.E. Sarkar A. Wampler J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In the case of the subtilisins, this cis-peptide bond forms a sharp type VI β-turn (33Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties.2nd Ed. W. M. Freeman and Co., New York1993Google Scholar, .2) in the inner loop 165-171 which serves as a floor for the active sites. In contrast to the subtilisins, all the SPCs contain Ala or Thr instead of Pro at positions corresponding to 168 of the subtilisins (21Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A.M. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 24Siezen R.J. Creemers J.W.M. van de Ven W.J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This suggests that a trans-, rather than cis-, peptide bond occurs in this position. In most proteins cis-peptide bonds occur exceptionally rarely preceding residues other than Pro (33Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties.2nd Ed. W. M. Freeman and Co., New York1993Google Scholar), e.g. the loop formed by the sequence, Thr-Gln-Ser-Pro-Ser-Ser (residues 5-10), of the Fab domain of immunoglobulin MCPC 603 contains a cis-peptide bond between Ser and Pro, whereas in the analogous loop, Thr-Gln-Thr-Thr-Ser-Ser, of Ig F19 all bonds are trans (files 1MCP and 1F19 of the Brookhaven Protein Data Base). Therefore, the alignment of amino acid residues for the loop 165-171 given by Siezen et al.(21Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A.M. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) in the SPCs may be incorrect. Moreover, in their alignment the small Gly or Ala residues at position 169 in the subtilisins are replaced by Asp (in SPC3, Table I) or Asn (in kexin and furin), which is unrealistic because the methyl group of the side chain of Ala169 makes close van der Waals contacts with the backbone and the side chains of residues 152 and 153, as well as with the side chain of residue 165 (Asp in SPC2 and SPC3, Table I). To appropriately align the amino acid sequences of the subtilisins and SPCs, we have taken into account the characteristic interactions of the side chains of the residues Tyr167 and Tyr171 at ends of the aforementioned loop. This packing has an energetically favored perpendicular arrangement of the aromatic rings (34Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 125-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) and is likely to be conserved in the structures of both the subtilisins and SPCs. In the alignment of Siezen et al.(21Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A.M. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), residue 167 is tyrosine in all enzymes; however, the downstream residue (Tyr171) in the sequences of the SPCs has been aligned with residue 172 (Pro or Asp) of the subtilisins. Such an alignment is unlikely according to the matrix of mutual substitutions of amino acid residues in proteins (35Shulz G.E. Schirmer R.M. Principles of Protein Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1979Crossref Google Scholar). For this reason it is difficult to accept the latest alignment given by Siezen et al.(24Siezen R.J. Creemers J.W.M. van de Ven W.J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) where Tyr167 and Tyr171 of the subtilisins and thermitase are substituted by Gly and Ser in the SPCs. Such substitutions would be expected to lead to a loss of the energy of nonbonded interactions between residues of Tyr167 and Tyr171 which for thermitase comprises ∼−7 kcal/mol. It is important that all known SPCs contain these 2 highly conserved aromatic residues in this loop (24Siezen R.J. Creemers J.W.M. van de Ven W.J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Fig. 6). In order to preserve the Tyr167-Tyr171 interaction in the SPCs, we propose a new alignment for sequences 165-171 of the subtilisins and the corresponding residues in SPC3 and SPC2 (Table II). In this alignment a small residue (Ser) occurs in position 325 (169) 3( 3The residue numbers for the subtilisins (BPN′ and Carlsberg) are given in parentheses after those for SPC3 hereinafter.) at the bottom of the S1 binding cavity, and the bulky side chain of Pro (168) of the subtilisins is substituted by the side chains of residues Asp, Ser, or Asn, which are located outside the S1 groove in the SPCs. As a consequence, the primary structures of the SPCs contain an inserted residue of Ala or Thr between residues (167) and (168) in the subtilisins. We propose that this additional residue in this loop in the SPCs compensates for the loss of the cis peptide bond of the subtilisins and promotes the formation of a new central β-turn, involving residues 320-327 of SPC3, which consists entirely of trans-peptide bonds (Table II).4( 4In order to verify our hypothesis, we have prepared the mutant Pro168Thr of subtilisin BPN′ (Q. Gong, unpublished data). Western blot analysis of the culture medium of the mutant revealed the absence of mature processed subtilisin BPN′. Therefore, this single mutation may interfere with the formation of a cis-peptide bond and disrupt the folding pathway for this subtilisin. This result provides evidence that Pro168 plays an important role in the self-organization of the subtilisins and that the tertiary structures of loops 165-171 in the subtilisins and 320-327 in SPCs differ significantly. Moreover, in accordance with our proposal the mutant Gly169Asp also was not active, indicating that the alignment of the position 169 (324) as given in Ref. 21Siezen R.J. de Vos W.M. Leunissen J.A.M. Dijkstra B.W. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 719-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar is not acceptable.) Table IINew proposal for alignment of amino acid residues in SPCs (sequences 319-329 of SPC3 and 164-175 in subtilisin BPN′) To conserve structural correspondence between the two loops,(165-171) and 320-327, in the preliminary stage of molecular modeling we introduced range constraints on the arrangements of the main chains of these two peptide strands between the Cα atoms of residues(165-167) and(168-171), removed the cis-peptide bond, and introduced a new residue, either Ala or Thr, between the Cα atoms of residues (167) and (168). This residue could be accommodated if it adopted the appropriate conformation of a classical γ-turn, which corresponds on a Ramachandran plot to the lower right square H (33Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties.2nd Ed. W. M. Freeman and Co., New York1993Google Scholar; Table 6.2). This γ-turn forms a sharp reverse turn in the mid-region of the 320-327(165-171) loop of the SPCs which is stabilized by the hydrogen bond CO (Tyr322) …HN (Asp324) and consists entirely of trans-peptide bonds (Fig. 1). Upon energy optimization of this initial structure (see “Conformations Models and Methods of Calculation”), we found a new conformation for the loop 320-327(165-171) in SPC3, which conserved effective interactions of the aromatic side chains of residues 322 (167) and 327 (171). The new version of this loop (Fig. 1) has been introduced into the structures of subtilisins BPN′ and Carlsberg by means of superposition of equivalent α-carbon atoms (except for Cα of the inserted residue) of the new and old loops with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.35 Å. All the following calculations of enzyme-substrate interactions have been performed with SPC active site models having this new loop structure. Any theoretical study of enzyme-substrate interactions should begin with considerations of factors which govern the primary specificity. It is most practical to undertake this initially at the stage of the formation of covalent complexes between the catalytic side chains of the enzyme and the atoms of the scissible bond of the substrate. Investigation of nonbonded Michaelis complexes would make this problem significantly more complex since the introduction of six additional variables for the orientation of the nonbonded substrate as a whole relative to the enzyme would be necessary. Subtilisin, like other serine proteases, cleaves peptide bonds in two steps (36Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The first step is the formation of a covalent bond between the C′ atom of the scissible peptide bond and the hydroxyl oxygen Oγ of the side chain of the catalytic Ser221 residue. This acyl-enzyme intermediate proceeds through a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate where the nitrogen atom of the peptide bond is protonated by His64. The second step of the reaction, deacylation, includes hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme by the attack of a water molecule, which is activated also by His64, to regenerate the free enzyme and release the product. This step also proceeds through a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate. The side chain of Asn155 and the NH group of Ser221 take part in the stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate in the catalytic pathway of the subtilases (36Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 41Wells J.A. Estell D.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1988; 13: 291-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The only exception at this position in the SPCs is Asp310 in SPC2 (5Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, SPC2 is optimally active at acidic pH 5.5, suggesting that this Asp could interact with the tetrahedral intermediate in its protonated form (11Smeekens S.P. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2997-3000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the acyl-enzyme intermediate and the corresponding tetrahedral adduct formed in the deacylation step with a single P1 residue (Arg) as the substrate component are the simplest models for calculating enzyme-substrate interactions and investigating the nature of the primary specificity of SPCs. Moreover, comparison of the structures of the acyl-enzymes and the tetrahedral intermediates allows us to investigate the stereochemistry of their mutual transformations. Models of substrate components (consisting of a single Arg residue) for both intermediate states of the enzymes SPC2 and SPC3 are shown in Fig. 2. The conformational possibilities for substrate components are determined by the dihedral angles of rotation around the Cα-N and Cα-C′ bonds of the main chain, ϕ(Cα-N) and ψ(Cα-C′), and around the side chain bonds, angles χ1(Cα-Cβ), χ2(Cβ-Cγ), χ3(Cγ-Cδ) and χ4(Cδ-N), of the Arg residue (Fig. 2). In addition, the dihedral angles of rotation around the side chain bonds of Ser382(221) [(χ1e (Cα-Cβ), χ2e (Cβ-Oγ)) and around the complex or simple ester bond (ωe (Oγ-C′) between this Ser residue and Arg (P1)] were calculated. The determination and description of the angles of rotation in the peptide chain corresponds to standard nomenclature (33Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structure and Molecular Properties.2nd Ed. W. M. Freeman and Co., New York1993Google Scholar, 35Shulz G.E. Schirmer R.M. Principles of Protein Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1979Crossref Google Scholar). The angles of rotation equal zero when the corresponding bonds in the backbone and in the side chain have a cis orientation. For the values of bond lengths and valence angles, the averaged parameters for peptide and ester bonds were used (35Shulz G.E. Schirmer R.M. Principles of Protein Structure. Springer-Verlag, New York1979Crossref Google Scholar). Zero approximation for the valence angles at the C′ atom of the scissible bond of the tetrahedral adduct was 109.5°. In the case of more complex substrate components that include several Arg residues (e.g. Arg-Ala-Ala-Arg), we have taken into account the same conformational parameters for the side chain of P4 Arg as for the P1 Arg and also have calculated the angles of rotation around the Cα-N and Cα-C′ bonds of the main chain; i.e. ϕ1 and ψ1 for residue P1, ϕ2 and ψ2 for P2, ϕ3 and ψ3 for P3, and ϕ4 and ψ4 for P4. Molecular modeling was carried out using the Insight and Discover graphical environments (Biosym Technologies, Inc., San Diego). The molecular mechanics energetic calculations utilized the force field cvff (consistent valence force field), which was specifically derived to apply to structures of peptides and proteins. In this approximation the formation of hydrogen bonds is modeled as an electrostatic interaction. Electrostatic interactions were calculated using a dielectric constant ε = 4. This value corresponds to the microscopic dielectric constant of polypeptides (39Sweet R.M. Wright M.T. Janin J. Chothia C.H. Blow D.M. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4212-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and usually is used for conformational calculations in polar media (37Scheraga H.A. Chem. Rev. 1971; 71: 195-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). N- and C- ends of peptide fragments of active sites were considered in neutral form as N-methyl and N-acetyl amides, correspondingly. For minimization procedures the steepest descends and conjugate gradients have been used. Atomic coordinates of the enzymes were taken from the Brookhaven Protein Data Base for subtilisin BPN′ and subtilisin Carlsberg (PDB codes 2 SNI and 2 SEC (27McPhalen C.A. James M.N.G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6582-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar)). We have not had any problems with substitutions of some amino acid residues in the active site of subtilisin by the new residues present in SPC3 or SPC2 (Tables I and II); the initial conformations of the side chains of corresponding residues was conserved, with the exception of the bulky side chain of Trp268(126) for which additional packing calculations were performed. In the case of the new loop 320-327 (165-171) the side chain at position 324 (168) (Asp in SPC3) forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of residue Trp268(126). The procedure for minimization of the potential energy of enzyme-substrate interactions consisted of two steps. First the arrangement of the substrate component was optimized within the field of the rigid binding cavity of the putative active sites of the enzymes SPC3 and SPC2, taking into account simultaneous variations in all the above described dihedral angles of rotation ϕ, ψ, χ1, χ2, χ3, χ4 (and also χ1e, χ2e, ω) for the P1 Arg residue (Fig. 2). Then the potential energy of the entire enzyme-substrate complex was minimized, allowing possible changes in the positions of amino acid residues within the active sites. With few exceptions the SPCs possess unique primary specificity toward Arg residues (19Nakayama K. Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Kim W.-S. Nagahama M. Hosaka M. Hatsuzawa K. Koudoh-Hashiba K. Murakami K.

Stopped-flow kinetics run under pseudo-first-order conditions ([Io] ⪢ [Eo]) show that in the absence of heparin the inhibition conforms to a simple bimolecular reaction, E+I⇌kdkaEI(Eq. 1) where, ka = 3.1 × 106 M−1s−1, kd= 10−4 s−1, and Ki= 33 pM, whereas in the presence of heparin, E and I react via a two-step mechanism, E+I⇌Ki∗EI∗⇌k−2k2EI(Eq. 2) where Ki∗ = 86 nM, k2 = 2.2 s−1, k−2 = 10−4 s−1, and Ki= 37 pM. Thus, heparin increases both the rate of inhibition by promoting the formation of a high affinity EI∗ intermediate and the rate of EI dissociation. Since the dissociation is negligible in bronchial secretions where the inhibitor concentration is much higher than Ki, it may be concluded that heparin significantly potentiates the inhibitor's antielastase potential in vivo. Commercial low molecular mass heparin accelerates the inhibition of neutrophil elastase by mucus proteinase inhibitor, the predominant antielastase of lung secretions (Faller, B., Mély, Y., Gérard, D., and Bieth, J. G.(1992) Biochemistry 31, 8285-8290). To study the kinetic mechanism of this rate enhancement, we have isolated a 4.5-kDa heparin fragment from commercial heparin. This compound is fairly monodisperse as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. It binds elastase and inhibitor with a 1:1 stoichiometry and an equilibrium dissociation constant of 3 and 210 nM, respectively. It also forms a tight complex with EI.

https://openalex.org/W2048905068,"Abstract RNA polymerase I of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is composed of 14 subunits. All of the corresponding genes have been cloned with the exception of the RPA14 gene encoding A14, a specific polypeptide of this enzyme. We report the cloning and the characterization of RPA14. The A14 polypeptide was separated from the other RNA polymerase I subunits by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and digested with proteinase K. Based on the amino acid sequence of one of the resulting peptides, a degenerate oligonucleotide was synthesized and used to isolate the RPA14 gene from a yeast subgenomic DNA library. RPA14 is a single copy gene that maps to chromosome IV and is flanked by CYP1 and HOM2. Disruption of RPA14 is not lethal, but growth of the rpa14::URA3 mutant strain is impaired at 37 and 38°C. RNA polymerase I was purified from the rpa14::URA3 strain. After two purification steps, the enzyme did not contain the subunits A14, ABC23, and A43. This form of the enzyme was not active in a nonspecific in vitro transcription assay. These results demonstrate that A14 is a genuine subunit of RNA polymerase I and suggest that A14 plays a role in the stability of a subgroup of subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1990479114,"Several different subassemblies of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme can be purified from Escherichia coli. Toward the goal of understanding the functional significance of these subassemblies, we have used the γ complex clamp loader and the β ring to assemble each different polymerase onto DNA. Through use of radioactive labeled proteins, the subunit structure of each resulting processive polymerase has been determined. Use of DNA polymerase III core, the γ complex, and β results in a core-β complex on DNA; the γ complex is not incorporated into the structure. The addition of τ to the assembly reaction to form either core1-τ2 or core2-τ2 results in a more efficient polymerase and more stabile association of core-τβ on DNA, although the γ complex still does not remain on DNA. The γ complex clamp loader was retained on DNA with the other subunits only if it was first assembled into the polymerase (Pol) III∗ structure. The clamp loader within Pol III∗ appeared to be capable of loading two β clamps onto DNA for both core polymerases within Pol III∗, consistent with the hypothesis that one replicase can simultaneously replicate both strands of a duplex chromosome. These findings extend those of an earlier study showing that distinctive polymerases can be assembled depending on the presence or absence of τ (Maki, S., and Kornberg, A.(1988) J. Biol.

Chem. 263, 6561-6569). The significance of these distinct polymerases in separate paths of DNA metabolism is discussed. DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (holoenzyme) is the replicative polymerase of the Escherichia coli chromosome (reviewed in Refs. 1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 165-194Google Scholar and 2Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Besides the holoenzyme, three different polymerase subassemblies can be purified from cells. 1) The three-subunit core polymerase is a 1:1:1 complex of α (DNA polymerase), ε (proofreading 3′-5′-exonuclease), and θ. 2) The four-subunit polymerase (Pol)1( 1The abbreviations used are: PolpolymeraseBSAbovine serum albuminSSBsingle-stranded DNA-binding protein of E. colissDNAsingle-stranded DNA.) III′ contains two molecules of core polymerase attached to a dimer of the τ subunit (core2-τ2). 3) The Pol III∗ assembly consists of nine different subunits (α2ε2θ2τ2γ2δ1δ′1χ1ψ1) and lacks only the β sliding clamp. These polymerase subassemblies do not have the rapid and processive character of the holoenzyme. Generally, they incorporate residues at a speed of 10-20 nucleotides/s, and their processivity ranges from 10 to 50 residues/binding event (3Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5692-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when combined with the β sliding clamp, each of these polymerases becomes rapid (750 nucleotides/s) and processive (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 165-194Google Scholar, 2Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Assembly of the ring-shaped β clamp (5Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) onto DNA requires the γ complex (γ2δ1δ′1χ1ψ1), which couples ATP hydrolysis to load β clamps onto DNA (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 165-194Google Scholar, 2Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The β sliding clamp confers a high degree of processivity onto the holoenzyme by tethering it to the primed template for continuous DNA synthesis (5Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). polymerase bovine serum albumin single-stranded DNA-binding protein of E. coli single-stranded DNA. Besides its role as a replicase, Pol III also functions in other areas of DNA metabolism (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 165-194Google Scholar). Perhaps the different polymerase subassemblies serve distinct functions in DNA metabolism. Consistent with this is the curious observation that Pol III∗ appears to be composed of one Pol III′ and one γ complex (7Maki H. Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6570-6578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yet Pol III′ and the γ complex do not associate to form Pol III∗ unless a specific order of addition is followed (8Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). If these subassemblies are formed separately within the cell, then this order of addition requirement may serve the purpose of providing the cell with a stabile quantity of each of these assemblies for action in other areas of DNA metabolism such as repair, recombination, and mutagenesis. Alternatively, Pol III′ and the γ complex may associate with each other in the presence of primed DNA and β. For example, proximity at a primed site may lead to their association. Yet another possibility is that the association of Pol III′ with the γ complex may be facilitated in vivo by a chaperonin. Toward the goal of understanding the functional significance of these subassemblies to replication and chromosome maintenance, these subassemblies have been used to assemble processive polymerases onto DNA using the γ complex clamp loader and β clamp, and each resulting polymerase on DNA has been analyzed for its structural composition and activity. These subassemblies were studied earlier using small amounts of isolated core, the γ complex, and overproduced β and τ subunits with the finding that distinctive polymerases (+τ) could be assembled onto a primed template (9Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6561-6569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Now that each subunit is available in quantity and the subassemblies can be constituted from them, we have tagged each subassembly with a subunit of known specific radioactivity, providing accurate stoichiometry measurements of each subassembly on DNA. Depending on the relative amounts of core and τ present in the cell, one may expect either one core (limiting core) or two cores (excess core) to associate with the τ dimer (10Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, we have constituted and studied both of these polymerase forms (core1-τ2 and core2-τ2). The results show that use of different polymerase subassemblies results in different processive polymerase structures attached to a β clamp on DNA. Furthermore, comparison of the polymerase formed using Pol III∗ plus β to that formed using Pol III′ plus the γ complex and β showed polymerases of different compositions on DNA even though all 10 holoenzyme subunits were present in both reactions. If these several different forms of DNA polymerase III also assemble onto primed DNA sites in the cell, then it seems likely that they could be used in different processes of DNA metabolism. Materials, methods, and sources not described here were described in the first report of this series (11Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A gapped circular DNA template was prepared by nicking M13mp18 plasmid DNA (376 μg) at a specific site using 35 units of M13 gene protein II (a gift of Dr. Peter Model (The Rockefeller University) and purified as described (12Meyer T.F. Geider K. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12636-12641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) in a 20-min incubation at 37°C in 3 ml of 40% sorbitol, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 6.7 mM MgCl2, 6.7 mM dithiothreitol, and 5 μg/ml BSA (13Greenstein D. Horiuchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 157-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This treatment results in a single nick at the M13 origin in ∼60% of the DNA templates. A gap was produced at the nick upon treatment with 1000 units of exonuclease III for 1 min at 37°C followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The average size of the gap was estimated to be 500 nucleotides from the amount of radioactive nucleotide incorporated by the holoenzyme using [α-32P]dTTP. Reaction buffer contained 5% glycerol, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 8 mM MgCl2, 40 μg/ml BSA, 0.5 mM ATP, 50 μM dCTP, 50 μM dGTP, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 5 mM dithiothreitol (ATP was omitted where indicated). The τ, γ, θ, δ′, and β subunits were 3H-labeled by reductive methylation as described (5Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of protein at a concentration of 1-3 mg/ml was incubated with 10 mM formaldehyde and 2 mM NaB3H4 (74 Ci/mmol) on ice for 15 min. The 3H-labeled protein was separated from unspent reagents by gel filtration in the fume hood on a 10-ml column of Sephadex G-25. The excluded fractions were counted, pooled, and stored at −70°C. The specific activities were as follows: [3H]θ, 15 cpm/fmol; [3H]τ, 29 cpm/fmol as dimer; [3H]γ, 29 cpm/fmol as dimer; [3H]δ′, 20 cpm/fmol as monomer; and [3H]β, 67 cpm/fmol as dimer. The replication activity of labeled protein relative to unlabeled protein was assessed by comparative titrations in replication assays as follows (14O'Donnell M. Studwell P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]β, assayed for replication of singly primed SSB-coated M13mp18 ssDNA with Pol III∗, was indistinguishable in activity from unlabeled β. The activity of [3H]τ was determined by reconstituting core2-τ2 using either unlabeled τ or [3H]τ and then comparing their replication activity with β and the γ complex on singly primed SSB-coated ssDNA. Core2-τ2 constituted using [3H]τ was within 2% of the activity of that constituted using unlabeled τ. The replication activity of [3H]γ was determined by constituting Pol III∗ using either [3H]γ or unlabeled γ and then testing their activity with β on singly primed SSB-coated circular ssDNA. Pol III∗ constituted using [3H]γ was within 80% of the activity of that constituted using unlabeled γ. The activity of [3H]δ′ was within 10% of that of unlabeled δ′ as determined by constituting the γ complex using either labeled or unlabeled δ′ and then comparing their replication activity with β and core2-τ2 on singly primed SSB-coated ssDNA. We initially tried labeling core using [3H]α, but [3H]α was only 40% as active as core reconstituted using unlabeled α. Therefore, core was 3H-labeled by reconstituting it using the [3H]θ subunit. The presence or absence of θ has no effect on holoenzyme activity; however, [3H]θ was as effective as unlabeled θ in forming a tight nondissociable complex with αε as determined by comigration of αε[3H]θ subunits during gel filtration analysis. A derivative of β containing an additional six amino acids at the C terminus (NH2-RRASVP-COOH) serves as a substrate for phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (15Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). This β derivative was labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and protein kinase as described in the second report of this series (16Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although this β derivative could be labeled to very high specific activity, the typical specific activity of [32P]β used in this report was low (20-65 cpm/fmol) such that both 32P and 3H could be assayed in the same sample by liquid scintillation. Subassemblies containing 3H-labeled subunits were constituted by incubating purified unlabeled subunits with one labeled subunit in buffer A at 15°C for 1 h, and then the resulting complex was purified from free subunits by chromatography. Fractions from the chromatography columns were analyzed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie Blue. Fractions containing the desired complex of proteins were pooled, dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer A, aliquoted, and stored frozen at −70°C. All complexes used here retain full activity for over 1 year when stored in this manner. Specific activities of complexes were determined by scintillation counting, and protein concentration was measured using the protein assay from Bio-Rad with BSA as a standard. [3H]τ2 was assembled upon incubating 180 μg (2.5 nmol) of [3H]τ, 960 μg (7.5 nmol) of α, 510 μg (18 nmol) of ε, and 294 μg (33 nmol) of θ in 1.44 ml and then purified from free subunits by chromatography on a 1-ml Mono Q column eluted with a 19-ml gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl in buffer A. The fractions containing core2-[3H]τ2 were pooled, concentrated to 200 μl using a Centricon 30 apparatus, and then gel-filtered on a 24-ml Superose 6 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) developed in buffer A containing 300 mM NaCl to remove any remaining excess core (43.2 μg of final complex recovered). Core2-[3H]τ2 had a specific activity of 30 cpm/fmol (474.2 kDa), consistent with the specific activity of [3H]τ2. [3H]Core2-τ2 was constituted by the same method as core2-[3H]τ2 (except [3H]θ and unlabeled τ were used), and it was purified on a Superose 6 column only. Its specific activity was 24 cpm/fmol, approximately half the specific activity of θ, since θ is only a monomer and two θ subunits are present in the [3H]core2-τ2 complex. [3H]Core1-τ2 was assembled by incubating 522 μg (3.75 nmol) of α, 132 μg (5 nmol) of ε, 58.8 μg (7.5 nmol) of [3H]θ, and 801 μg (11.25 nmol) of τ in 1.6 ml and then was concentrated using a Centricon 30 apparatus to 7.6 mg/ml and purified by Superose 6 chromatography as described above (final amount of 67 μg). [3H]Core1-τ2 had a specific activity of 18 cpm/fmol (304 kDa), consistent with the presence of only one molecule of θ/core1-τ2 complex. The [3H]γ complex (γδ[3H]δ′χψ) was assembled by mixing 710 μg (9 nmol) of γχψ complex (reconstituted as described (11Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Xiao H. Crombie R. Dong Z. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11773-11778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), 392 μg (11 nmol) of δ, and 340 μg (9 nmol) of δ′ in 2.045 ml and then was purified on a 1-ml Mono Q column using a 19-ml gradient of 0-0.5 M NaCl in buffer A. The fractions containing γδδ′χψ were pooled (302 μg), dialyzed against buffer A, and stored at −70°C. The specific radioactivity of the [3H]γ complex was 20 cpm/fmol, consistent with the presence of only one δ′ subunit within the complex. Three preparations of Pol III∗ were constituted differing only in which subunit was labeled. Pol III∗ was assembled in stages essentially as described in the third report of this series (8Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Turner J. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13366-13377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The subunits were added in the following molar ratios before purification (relative to τ2): α, 3.0; ε, 4.5; θ, 7.0; τ2, 1.0; γ2, 3.0; δ, 7.0; δ′, 6.0; χ, 7.0; and ψ, 6.0. Detailed procedures were as follows. [3H]Pol III∗ labeled with [3H]γ was assembled upon incubating 352 μg (3.7 nmol) of [3H]γ with 178 μg (1.25 nmol) of τ, 145 μg (8.73 nmol) of χ, and 114 μg (7.5 nmol) of ψ in 789 μl. After 30 min, 328 μg (8.48 nmol) of δ and 278 μg (7.53 nmol) of δ′ were added, bringing the volume to 1394 μl, and then incubated for an additional 30 min. During this time, a separate tube containing 200 μg (1.55 nmol) of α, 154 μg (5.6 nmol) of ε, and 76 μg (8.84 nmol) of θ was incubated for 30 min in 283 μl. Then the two tubes were mixed and incubated for an additional 30 min. Pol III∗ was separated from free subunits and subassemblies by chromatography on a 1-ml heparin-agarose column eluted with a 15-ml gradient of 0-325 mM NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing Pol III∗ were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and then chromatographed on a 1-ml Mono Q column eluted with a 30-ml gradient of 0-0.4 M NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing Pol III∗ were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and stored at −70°C. The specific activity of [3H]Pol III∗ ([3H]γ) was 29 cpm/fmol, consistent with one dimer of γ within Pol III∗. [3H]Pol III∗ labeled with [3H]θ was assembled as described above for Pol III∗ labeled with [3H]γ, and its specific activity was 18 cpm/fmol, consistent with two molecules of θ in the Pol III∗ structure (final yield of 142 μg). [3H]Pol III∗ labeled with [3H]τ was assembled as described for Pol III∗ labeled with [3H]γ, except that a pre-purified γχψ complex was incubated with [3H]τ. A further difference was the use of Superose 6 gel filtration in place of the Mono Q column, which removes the small amount of core4-([3H]τ)4 side product of the assembly. Use of Superose 6 required concentration of the sample after heparin-agarose chromatography to 70 μl using a Centricon 30 apparatus (final yield of 23.8 μg). In general, subunits and subassemblies were added to DNA templates in 75 μl of reaction buffer on ice and then incubated at 37°C for 4 min to allow time for assembly onto primed DNA. Reactions were then gel-filtered on 5-ml columns developed in column buffer, and fractions of 200 μl were collected over a period of 30 min at 4°C. Tritium and 32P were quantitated in the same fraction by analyzing aliquots of 150 μl in 5 ml of Aquasol (DuPont NEN) by liquid scintillation counting (3H window was 0-350; 32P window was 400-1000). The specific activities of [32P]β and of the 3H-labeled subunits were comparable in all the experiments, and therefore, bleed-over of one isotope into the window of another was <1%. Reaction buffer contained 50 μM each dCTP and dGTP in all experiments to prevent the 3′-5′-exonuclease activity of the ε subunit from digesting primed templates during assembly reactions and on gel filtration columns. The individual volumes of reactions and incubation times varied and are detailed in the figure legends. The recovery of [32P]β was typically 75-90% using either Sephacryl S-400 or Bio-Gel A-15m. The recovery of the [3H]γ complex and complexes containing [3H]τ was only 50-70% on Bio-Gel A-15m, but was 56-80% on Sephacryl. Therefore, after the experiment of Fig. 2, subsequent gel filtrations were performed with Sephacryl columns. In experiments using [32P]β assembled onto gapped DNA by the γ complex, the γ complex (0.76 μg, 3.78 pmol) was preincubated with [32P]β (0.76 μg, 3.78 pmol) and gapped DNA (4.1 μg, 1.8 pmol) saturated with SSB (28.8 μg) in 382 μl of reaction buffer for 4 min at 37°C. Then the reaction was split into 85-μl aliquots in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes that contained 15 μl of core (290 ng, 1.8 pmol), core1-τ2 (540 ng, 1.8 pmol), or core2-τ2 (840 ng, 1.8 pmol) in buffer A with 40 μg/ml BSA and incubated for an additional 2 min at 37°C prior to analysis of 75 μl by gel filtration. Replication reactions contained 130 ng (30 fmol) of gapped M13mp18 DNA, 0.32 of μg SSB, 22 ng (272 fmol) of β, 6 ng (30 fmol) of γ complex (omitted when Pol III∗ was used), and one of the following: core, core1-τ2, core2-τ2, or Pol III∗ (amounts are indicated in the legend to Fig. 1) in 23.5 μl of reaction buffer. Reactions were shifted to 37°C for 5 min to allow time for Polymerase assembly onto DNA, and then a 15-s pulse of DNA synthesis was initiated upon the addition of 1.5 μl of dATP and [α-32P]dTTP (final concentrations of 60 and 20 μM, respectively). Synthesis was quenched after 15 s upon spotting onto DE81 filter paper and quantitated as described (11Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In gel filtration experiments, polymerase-DNA complexes were quantitated for DNA synthesis as follows. An 11-μl aliquot of the reaction was removed, and a 1.5-μl aliquot of dATP and [α-32P]dTTP (final concentrations of 60 and 20 μM, respectively) was added to initiate DNA synthesis. The reaction was shifted to 37°C, and then after 15 s, the reaction was quenched with 12.5 μl of 1% SDS and 40 mM EDTA. The extent of replication in the reaction was analyzed by two methods. First, a 10-μl aliquot was spotted onto DE81 paper, and the amount of incorporated nucleotides was quantitated as described (11Onrust R. Finkelstein J. Naktinis V. Turner J. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13348-13357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Second, a 10-μl aliquot was analyzed on a 0.6% native agarose gel, which separates unreplicated template from replicative form II product. The DNA was visualized by UV-induced fluorescence of ethidium bromide. Throughout this report, the physical presence of protein on DNA was identified and quantitated through use of radioactive subunits of known specific radioactivity. 3H-Labeled protein and primed DNA were mixed, and then the protein-DNA complexes were gel-filtered on a large pore molecular sieving column. Protein bound to DNA comigrates with the large DNA template in the excluded volume and resolves from unbound proteins in the included volume. The molar amount of 3H-labeled protein bound to DNA was calculated from the known specific radioactivity. There are 10 different proteins in the holoenzyme, and we have not labeled each of them. Instead, we have labeled the β clamp, the τ subunit, the θ subunit of core, the δ′ subunit of the γ complex, either the θ or τ subunit of Pol III′, and the θ, τ, or γ subunit of Pol III∗. Thus, some conclusions drawn in this study rest on the assumption that these subassemblies remain tightly associated through gel filtration. This assumption is supported by the tight association between the subunits of these 3H-labeled complexes through liquid chromatography resins and gel filtration columns (15Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Stukenberg, P. T., 1993, The Dynamics of E. coli DNA Polymerase III Holoenzyme in an in Vitro Lagging Strand Model System. Ph.D. thesis, Cornell University Medical College.Google Scholar) and during their preparation (see “Experimental Procedures”). The τ dimer binds two core polymerases provided core is supplied in excess. If core is limiting, then only one core is present on the τ dimer (10Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19833-19841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have prepared both forms for these studies (core2-τ2 and core1-τ2). To follow the β clamp and 3H-labeled proteins in the same experiment, β was 32P-labeled by engineering a six-residue kinase recognition motif onto the C terminus, followed by 32P radiolabeling with a protein kinase. This derivative of β is as active as unmodified β (15Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 27Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Pol III∗ and the γ complex interact nonspecifically with SSB-coated ssDNA (i.e. the interaction is independent of ATP, β, and a primed site) (5Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Fradkin L.G. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10318-10322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The basis for this interaction is weak binding between the χ subunit and SSB that depends on ssDNA.2( 2The χ-SSB interaction requires no other proteins, and the ssDNA is not absolutely required, but strengthens the χ-SSB interaction considerably (Z. Kelman and M. O'Donnell, manuscript in preparation).) This particular interaction must be reduced for quantitative studies of other specific protein-DNA complexes. Thus, the template used in these studies is an M13mp18 plasmid with a ssDNA gap of 500 nucleotides. This template minimizes the amount of SSB-coated ssDNA in the assay and reduces to a low background level this “nonspecific” interaction of the γ complex and Pol III∗ with SSB-coated ssDNA (15Stukenberg P.T. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1994; 78: 877-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 18Stukenberg, P. T., 1993, The Dynamics of E. coli DNA Polymerase III Holoenzyme in an in Vitro Lagging Strand Model System. Ph.D. thesis, Cornell University Medical College.Google Scholar). In Fig. 1, the replication activities of core, core1-τ2, core2-τ2, and Pol III∗ were compared on the SSB-coated gapped DNA template containing a β clamp (assembled onto DNA by the γ complex prior to initiating replication). The results show that Pol III∗ is the most active of these polymerases, core is least active, and the core-τ polymerases are intermediate in activity. Similar results are observed if the polymerase subassemblies are included during the assembly of the β clamp onto DNA and onto primed ssDNA (data not shown). This hierarchy is consistent with earlier studies showing that τ stimulates the activity of core with a β clamp (9Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6561-6569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is also consistent with studies in the absence of β, in which polymerase subassemblies of increasing subunit complexity are also increasingly active in DNA synthesis (3Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5692-5699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The differences may lie in different processivity or speed of chain elongation or in differential efficiencies of polymerase binding to a β clamp on primed DNA. Previous work has already shown that the αεβ complex is similar to holoenzyme in its rapid and processive chain elongation (5Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have examined the relative binding stability of different polymerase subassemblies to a β clamp on DNA. In Fig. 2, a [32P]β clamp was assembled onto circular gapped DNA using the γ complex and then incubated for 2 min with [3H]core, [3H]core1-τ2, or [3H]core2-τ2 prior to analysis by gel filtration (see scheme at the top of Fig. 2). Because only two of the four dNTPs were included, the polymerase was unable to replicate the template and was stalled in an elongation mode. Proteins bound to the large DNA template elute early (fractions 9-14) and resolve from free proteins that elute later (fractions 15-30). The number of β clamps assembled onto DNA is approximately equimolar to the input DNA in all three experiments (Fig. 2, A-C, left panels). The amount of core1-τ2 and core2-τ2 bound to DNA in the excluded fractions was nearly equimolar to the β clamp (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively). However, in the absence of τ, only half as much core was retained with β on DNA (Fig. 2A, left panel). Hence, τ provides stoichiometric interaction between core and β on DNA. In the absence of ATP, the β clamp is not assembled onto the DNA, and none of the polymerases comigrate with the DNA in appreciable amounts (Fig. 2, A-C, rightpanels). This result implies that these polymerases require a β clamp o"

The chemotactic peptide fMLP and the phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, are known to stimulate phosphatidylcholine degradation by phospholipase D in human neutrophils. fMLP alone triggered phosphatidylcholine breakdown into phosphatidic acid, but did not stimulate phosphatidylcholine synthesis or activation of the rate-limiting enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase.

https://openalex.org/W1964375961,"Translocation of apolipoprotein (apo) B across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane is a likely site for regulation of secretion of very low density lipoproteins from the liver. When primary rat hepatocytes are enriched with the phospholipid phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, the secretion of apoB, but not other proteins such as apoprotein A1 and albumin, is disrupted (Vance, J. E.(1991) J. Lipid Res. 32, 1971-1982). Moreover, less apoB enters the microsomal lumen and the intracellular degradation of apoB is increased (Rusiol, A. E., Chan, E. Y. W., and Vance, J. E. (1993a) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 25168-25175). In the present study we have used McArdle 7777 rat hepatoma cells stably transfected with carboxyl-terminal-truncated variants of human apoB100 and have demonstrated that the reduction in apoB secretion induced by phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine is not a function of assembly of the apoB into a buoyant lipoprotein particle. In addition, inhibition of the intracellular degradation of the apoproteins B does not restore apoB secretion, suggesting that the effect of phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine enrichment on apoB degradation is secondary to the effect on translocation of the protein into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Furthermore, supplementation of the culture medium with oleic acid does not increase apoB secretion, reduce the intracellular degradation of apoB or reverse the effects of phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine enrichment on these processes. Our data support the hypothesis that translocation of apoB protein across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, regardless of the association of the apoB with neutral lipids, may be a key regulatory step in very low density lipoprotein secretion.

Our data support the hypothesis that translocation of apoB protein across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, regardless of the association of the apoB with neutral lipids, may be a key regulatory step in very low density lipoprotein secretion. A major risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis is the presence of high levels of apolipoprotein (apo)1( 1The abbreviations used are: apoapolipoproteinALLNN-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinalDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumMMEmonomethylethanolaminePMMEphosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine.) B in the circulation (Sniderman et al., 1980Sniderman A. Shapiro S. Marpole D. Skinner B. Teng B. Kwiterowich P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The plasma concentration of apoB is determined by the balance of its rate of secretion, primarily from the liver, and its rate of removal from the blood via low density lipoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis (Brown and Goldstein, 1976Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1976; 191: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). ApoB is synthesized in the liver and intestine and is thought to be assembled with lipids into very low density lipoprotein particles in the endoplasmic reticulum (Alexander et al., 1976Alexander C.A.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3555-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB secretion from the liver is apparently not normally regulated by alteration in the rate of apoB synthesis or in the level of apo-mRNA. Instead, apoB is synthesized constitutively and in excess of its needs for lipoprotein secretion (Pullinger et al., 1989Pullinger C.R. North J.D. Teng B.-B. Rifici V.A. Ronhild de Brito A.E. Scott J. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Dashti et al., 1989; Sorci-Thomas et al., 1989Sorci-Thomas M. Wilson M.D. Johnson F.L. Williams D.L. Rudel L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9039-9045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Superfluous apoB that is not assembled into lipoprotein particles is degraded intracellularly, most likely in the endoplasmic reticulum (Davis et al., 1990Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Furukawa et al., 1992Furukawa S. Sakata N. Ginsberg H.N. Dixon J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 11880-11884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two possible scenarios might link the degradation and secretion of apoB. In the first, the intracellular degradation of apoB might limit the secretion of apoB. In the second, another factor, such as translocation of apoB across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, or the association of apoB with lipids, might control how much apoB is secreted. Consequently, any apoB that is not secreted would be degraded. In the latter case, translocation of newly translated apoB across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and into the lumen would be a key regulatory process. apolipoprotein N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium monomethylethanolamine phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine. As a step toward understanding how the secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins from the liver is regulated, we have recently developed a model in which the secretion of apoproteins B100 and B48, but not other secretory proteins such as albumin and apoA1, is specifically inhibited when the concentration of the phospholipid, PMME, is increased in rat hepatocyte membranes (Vance, 1991Vance J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1971-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The defect in apoB secretion upon enrichment of the cells' membranes with PMME was shown to be associated with (i) a disruption in translocation of apoB into the microsomal lumen, (ii) an increased exposure of apoB on the cytosolic surface of the microsomes, and (iii) an increased intracellular degradation of apoB (Rusiol et al., 1993aRusiol A.E. Chan E.Y.W. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25168-25175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now investigated further the mechanism by which PMME inhibits apoB secretion by dissociation of the processes of translocation of the protein into the lumen and acquisition of neutral core lipids by apoB. McArdle rat hepatoma cell lines that had been stably transfected with carboxyl-truncated variants of human apoB100 (apoB15, apoB18, apoB23, and apoB28, representing the amino-terminal 15, 18, 23, and 28% of human apoB100, respectively) were examined for the effect of PMME enrichment on secretion of the truncated apoproteins B. ApoB15, apoB18, and apoB23 are secreted from these hepatoma cells at a density of >1.23 g/ml, implying that essentially no neutral lipids (i.e. triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters) are associated with the secreted apoB (Yao et al., 1991Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoB28 is secreted in the form of a lipoprotein particle of size and density corresponding to that of high density lipoprotein (density of 1.17 g/ml). ApoB28 is therefore secreted in association with some neutral “core” lipids and presumably also with some surface lipids (phospholipids and cholesterol) (Yao et al., 1991Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have found that secretion of all four truncated variants of apoB was inhibited and that the intracellular degradation of the apoproteins B was increased, when the cells were enriched with PMME. These observations indicate that the inhibitory effect of PMME enrichment on apoB secretion is not dependent upon acquisition of the neutral lipid core, but is related to a defect in translocation of newly synthesized apoB across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In addition, inhibition of the intracellular degradation of apoB with the cysteine protease inhibitor, ALLN, did not reverse the inhibition of secretion caused by PMME, suggesting that increased degradation of the truncated apoproteins B induced by PMME is secondary to the effect of PMME on translocation of the proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Stably transfected McArdle 7777 rat hepatoma cells expressing apoB15, apoB18,2( 2Z. Yao, S. Selby, and S. Lingrell, unpublished data.) apoB23, and apoB28 were generous gifts from Dr. Zemin Yao, University of Alberta. [35S]Methionine and Amplify were purchased from Amersham, Canada, and Tran35S-label was obtained from ICN, Irvine, CA. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Millipore. Antibodies directed against rat apoB100 and rat apoA1 were prepared and characterized in our laboratory by standard procedures (Rusiol et al., 1993aRusiol A.E. Chan E.Y.W. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25168-25175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody directed against human apoB was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim, as was the calpain inhibitor I, ALLN. Monomethylethanolamine and water-soluble oleic acid (encapsulated in β-cyclodextrin) were from Sigma. The reagents used for electrophoresis were supplied by Bio-Rad. All other chemicals and solvents were purchased from either Sigma or Fisher. Transfected McArdle 7777 cells were plated on 60-mm culture dishes (Falcon) at a concentration of approximately 3 × 106 cells/dish. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, DMEM, containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were grown at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. When growth reached 70% confluence, the cells were incubated overnight (16 h) in the presence of 400 or 0 mM MME in DMEM and used the next morning. The culture media were harvested and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove cell debris. Cells were scraped from the dishes and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g. The monolayer of cells was preincubated for 1 h in methionine-free DMEM, then incubated with 1 ml of the same medium containing 200 μCi/dish of Tran35S-label for 1 h. Radioactivity was chased for defined periods of time, up to 4 h, in DMEM containing 400 μM unlabeled methionine and various additives, as defined for each experiment. ApoB products were immunoprecipitated from cells and culture medium with polyclonal antibody directed against rat apoB using a published method (Borchardt and Davis, 1987Borchardt R.A. Davis R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Rusiol et al., 1993bRusiol A.E. Verkade H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3555-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation the proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The gel was stained and subsequently impregnated with Amplify for 15 min and dried. Autoradiography of the dried gel was performed at −80°C for 16-32 h. The apoB-containing bands were excised from the gel, the gel was digested with 20% hydrogen peroxide (Rusiol et al., 1993bRusiol A.E. Verkade H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3555-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and radioactive incorporation into apoB was measured. McArdle 7777 cells expressing apoproteins B15, B18, and B28 were incubated in the presence of 0 or 400 μM MME for 16 h. Newly synthesized proteins were subsequently radiolabeled by addition of 100 μCi/dish of [35S]methionine. After time intervals of from 0.5 to 6 h, apoproteins B were immunoprecipitated from the cells with a polyclonal antibody directed against human apoB100; the proteins were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and the apoB-containing bands were excised from the gels for measurement of radioactivity. In an alternative experimental protocol, apoB18-expressing cells that had been incubated in the presence or absence of MME were labeled with [35S]methionine for 5-20 min, and radioactivity in apoB18 was measured after immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amounts of apoproteins B and A1 secreted into the medium were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using polyclonal antibodies directed against human apoB and rat apoA1, respectively, as described previously (Rusiol et al., 1993bRusiol A.E. Verkade H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3555-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mass of apoproteins B secreted into the medium was also examined by immunoblotting of aliquots of culture medium as described previously using a polyclonal antibody directed against human apoB100 (Rusiol et al., 1993bRusiol A.E. Verkade H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3555-3562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). McArdle 7777 cells expressing apoB28 or apoB18 were incubated for 16 h with or without MME (400 μM). Microsomes were isolated as described previously (Rusiol et al., 1993aRusiol A.E. Chan E.Y.W. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25168-25175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 80 μg of protein was treated with 0.1 volume of trypsin (0.5 mg/ml) for 30 min at 0°C. Proteolysis was terminated by addition of 0.1 volume of soybean trypsin inhibitor (4 mg/ml), and microsomes were re-isolated by centrifugation for 15 min at 400,000 × g in a Beckman TL 100.3 rotor. The membrane pellet was boiled for 5 min in a solution containing 8 M urea and 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Aliquots of the extract were subjected to electrophoresis on an 8.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using a polyclonal antibody raised against human apoB100 (Boehringer Mannheim) and a polyclonal antibody specific for rat apoA1, raised in our laboratory. The amounts of apoB and apoA1 were estimated by densitometric scanning of the immunoblots. The protein content of the cells was measured by the method of Lowry et al., 1951Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J.

We have previously shown that enrichment of microsomal membranes of primary rat hepatocytes with PMME inhibited the secretion of apoproteins B100 and B48 as a result of a defective movement of the apoproteins B into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (Vance, 1991Vance J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1971-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Rusiol et al., 1993aRusiol A.E. Chan E.Y.W. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25168-25175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies did not, however, distinguish between whether the defect was due to a problem in translocation of the apoB protein across the membrane or whether the defect was the result of the inability of the protein to associate with lipid and assemble into a lipoprotein particle. We have attempted to distinguish between these two possibilities by examining the effect of PMME enrichment of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane on the translocation and secretion of four carboxyl-truncated variants of human apoB100: apoB15, apoB18, apoB23, and apoB28. McArdle 7777 hepatoma cells expressing these apoproteins were cultured for 16 h in the absence or presence of MME (400 μM). In the MME-treated cells the amount of PMME was 3.18 ± 0.21 nmol/mg of protein and in cells not incubated with MME the PMME content was 0.21 ± 0.08 nmol/mg of protein. The amounts of apoB variants secreted into the culture media were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 1A) using a polyclonal antibody directed against human apoB100. As shown in Fig. 1A, the amounts of B15, B18, B23, and B28 secreted were reduced by 55.8, 42.9, 44.8, and 57.3%, respectively, as a result of incubation with MME. Since the mass of apoproteins B in the medium, as shown in Fig. 1A, represents the truncated apoB species, as well as small amounts of endogenous, native rat apoproteins B100 and apoB48, samples of the culture medium isolated after 16-h incubation were examined by immunoblotting specifically for the amount of truncated apoprotein B secreted. The data presented in Fig. 1B, in agreement with the data shown in Fig. 1A, confirm that PMME enrichment significantly reduced the amount of the truncated apoproteins B secreted into the culture medium. These data demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of PMME enrichment previously observed for the secretion of apoB100 and apoB48 from rat hepatocytes is also evident for these truncated apoB species in transfected McArdle 7777 cells. The secretion of native apoB100 and apoB48 from the transfected McArdle cell lines was also inhibited by approximately 50% upon PMME enrichment of the cells (data not shown). Since secreted apoB15 and apoB18 are not appreciably associated with a neutral lipid core (Yao et al., 1991Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our observation implies that the effect of PMME on apoB secretion is not related to binding of apoB to neutral lipid. Rather, PMME enrichment of the membranes most likely affects the process of translocation of apoB across the membrane. The defect in secretion induced by PMME appeared to be specific for apoB. In primary rat hepatocytes PMME enrichment did not impair the translocation/secretion of other secretory proteins, such as albumin and apoAI (Vance, 1991Vance J.E. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1971-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the McArdle cells expressing the truncated apoproteins B we measured the secretion of apoA1 into the culture medium by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PMME enrichment of these cells did not inhibit the secretion of apoA1 (Fig. 1A). ApoB is constitutively synthesized by hepatocytes (Pullinger et al., 1989Pullinger C.R. North J.D. Teng B.-B. Rifici V.A. Ronhild de Brito A.E. Scott J. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1065-1077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in excess of the requirement for lipoprotein secretion. ApoB that is not assembled into lipoprotein particles for secretion is apparently degraded intracellularly, most likely in the endoplasmic reticulum (Davis et al., 1990Davis R.A. Thrift R.N. Wu C.C. Howell K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10005-10011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Sato et al., 1990Sato R. Imanaka T. Takatsuki A. Takano T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22630-22638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intracellular degradation of apoB15, apoB18, and apoB28 was examined in transfected McArdle 7777 hepatoma cells. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h, after which the radioactive medium was removed, and the incubation was continued for a chase period of up to 4 h. ApoB proteins were immunoprecipitated from cells and culture medium, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the apoB-containing bands were excised from the gel for measurement of radioactivity (Fig. 2). In cells incubated without MME, radioactivity in all three cellular apoproteins B decayed as a function of time with a concomitant increase in radioactivity in secreted apoB. Almost all of the decrease in radioactivity in the intracellular apoproteins B (94.5% for apoB15, 80.9% for apoB18, and 84.5% for apoB28) was recovered in the secreted apoproteins B. Therefore, only 5-19% of the newly synthesized, truncated apoproteins B was degraded intracellularly, in agreement with the report of Yao et al., 1991Yao Z. Blackhart B.D. Linton M.F. Taylor S.M. Young S.G. McCarthy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3300-3308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The experiment was repeated with cells that had been preincubated with MME for 16 h. When these data were compared with those from cells incubated in the absence of MME, a smaller percentage of radioactive apoB present in the cells at the end of the 1-h pulse was secreted from cells treated with MME (Fig. 2). Of the radioactivity present in apoB15, apoB18, and apoB28 at the end of the 1-h pulse, 40.3, 50.1, and 55.0%, respectively, had been degraded intracellularly by the end of the 4-h chase period. These data demonstrate that the intracellular degradation of the apoB variants was increased upon enrichment of cells with PMME and that the efficiency of secretion was decreased. As confirmation that the truncated apoproteins B were not being degraded in the culture medium, apoB28-expressing cells that had been enriched in PMME were incubated for 16 h with [35S]methionine. One-half of the medium was used directly for immunoprecipitation of apoB28. The other half of the medium was added to unlabeled cells, then re-isolated after 4 h incubation. ApoB was immunoprecipitated and separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recovery of radioactivity in apoB28 from medium incubated with cells for 4 h was 89.3%, indicating that little degradation of apoB had occurred in the culture medium. We have previously demonstrated that incubation of primary rat hepatocytes with 400 μM MME overnight did not inhibit the synthesis of apoproteins B100 or B48 (Rusiol et al., 1993aRusiol A.E. Chan E.Y.W. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25168-25175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the amount of intracellular apoB reflects both synthesis and removal (by intracellular degradation and secretion), we examined whether or not the decreased rate of secretion of the truncated apoB variants in the presence of MME could be explained by a decreased rate of synthesis. In a continuous labeling experiment McArdle cells expressing apoB28 were incubated for 16 h in the presence of 0 or 400 μM MME, then 100 μCi/dish of [35S]methionine was added. After time intervals of 30 min to 6 h apoB28 was immunoprecipitated from the cells, the proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the apoB28-containing band was excised for measurement of radioactivity. The labeling curves for apoB28 were essentially identical for cells incubated in the presence and absence of MME (data not shown). We also examined the synthesis of apoB18 by labeling the cells with [35S]methionine for 5-20 min. At all times, the radioactivity in apoB18 in MME-treated cells was approximately 20% higher than in control cells (data not shown). We conclude, therefore, that the synthesis of the truncated apoBs is not inhibited by MME treatment. Rather, for apoB18, the synthetic rate appears to be slightly enhanced in MME-treated cells compared with untreated cells. In primary rat hepatocytes (Thrift et al., 1992Thrift R.N. Drisko J. Dueland S. Trawick J.D. Davis R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9161-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and in Hep G2 human hepatoma cells (Dixon et al., 1991Dixon J.L. Furukawa S. Ginsberg H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5080-5086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a pool of microsomal apoB is apparently exposed to the cytosolic surface and is consequently susceptible to degradation upon treatment of intact microsomes with exogenously added proteases. In primary rat hepatocytes treated with MME, microsomal apoB100 and apoB48 are more susceptible to degradation by exogenous trypsin than is apoB in microsomes from hepatocytes not treated with MME (Rusiol et al., 1993aRusiol A.E. Chan E.Y.W. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25168-25175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicated that PMME enrichment of microsomal membranes impaired the translocation of apoB into the microsomal lumen so that a smaller fraction of the apoB was protected from degradation by the exogenously added protease. Microsomes were isolated from apoB28- and apoB18-expressing McArdle 7777 cells that had been incubated for 16 h with or without MME. The sensitivity of apoB28 and apoB18 in these microsomes to digestion by exogenously added trypsin was examined. The results presented in Fig. 3 revealed that in cells not treated with MME essentially all of the microsomal apoB28 (83.6 ± 2.9%) and apoB18 (99.0 ± 3.6%) was protected from proteolysis. In contrast, in PMME-enriched microsomes the majority of microsomal apoB28 (89.4 ± 1.6%), and 39.4 ± 9.1% of apoB18 (according to densitometric scanning of the immunoblots), was degraded by trypsin, apparently as a result of being exposed on the cytosolic surface of the microsomes. The resistance of the microsomal apoproteins B to trypsin digestion was not due to an inherent inability of trypsin to degrade the proteins, because when the microsomes were disrupted with the detergent Triton X-100, all the microsomal apoB28 and apoB18 was proteolyzed (Fig. 3). As a note of caution when interpreting these results, some investigators have questioned whether or not the susceptibility of apoB to exogenous protease is indeed due to exposure of the protein on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Pease et al., 1991Pease R.J. Harrison G.B. Scott J. Nature. 1991; 353: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; Shelness et al., 1994Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the accessibility of apoB, but not apoA1, to exogenous protease is clearly different in PMME-enriched cells compared with that in control cells. We did not examine the protease sensitivity of apoB15 in transfected McArdle cells. However, in other studies we have shown that protection of in vitro translated apoB15 from protease is decreased upon PMME enrichment of microsomes.3( 3A. E. Rusiol, S. L. Chuck, V. R. Lingappa, and J. E. Vance, submitted for publication.) The secretion of endogenous, native apoA1 from the McArdle cells was not affected by PMME enrichment (Fig. 1A). Moreover, microsomal apoA1 in the transfected McArdle cells was almost completely protected from exogenous trypsin in both control and PMME-enriched microsomes (by 94.3 ± 7.5% and 87.3 ± 2.3%, respectively) (Fig. 3, A and B). These observations indicate that the increased degradation of apoB18 and apoB28 observed in PMME-enriched microsomes was not the result of “leaky” microsomes, but was due to an increased exposure of the apoproteins B on the cytosolic surface of the microsomes. Two alternative explanations might account for the increased degradation and decreased secretion of apoproteins B in PMME-enriched cells. First, the increased content of PMME in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane might have stimulated apoB degradation making less apoB available for secretion. In this case, the degradation of apoB would have limited its secretion. Alternatively, enrichment of PMME in the membranes might have impaired the translocation process per se, resulting in less apoB being secreted. As a consequence of the blocked translocation process, apoB would reside in the translocation channel, or become associated with the membrane, for an increased length of time, and the susceptibility of apoB to degradation would be increased. In an attempt to examine a cause and effect relationship between translocation and degradation of the truncated apoproteins B, we investigated whether or not inhibition of apoB degradation would promote the secretion of truncated apoproteins B and thereby reverse the impact of PMME enrichment on this process. The cysteine protease inhibitor ALLN (calpain inhibitor I), a tripeptide which blocks the intracellular degradation of apoB in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Thrift et al., 1992Thrift R.N. Drisko J.

In the present study, we demonstrate a central function for Lys-15 of Azotobacter vinelandii nitrogenase iron protein (FeP) in the interaction of nucleotides with nitrogenase. Changing Lys-15 of the FeP to Arg resulted in an FeP with a dramatically reduced affinity for both MgATP and MgADP.

Analysis of K15R FeP by EPR, circular dichroism (CD), and microcoulometry revealed that the [4Fe-4S] cluster was unaffected by the amino acid change and that addition of either MgADP or MgATP did not result in the protein conformational changes normally detected by these techniques.

The hydrolysis of a minimum of 16 MgATP to 16 MgADP and 16 Pi is required for the reduction of each N2 to 2 NH3 by purified nitrogenase (for reviews, see Refs. 1Burris R.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The exact mode of nucleotide binding, the mechanism of MgATP hydrolysis, and the mechanism of coupling of this hydrolysis to substrate reduction within nitrogenase remains largely undefined. Nitrogenase is a complex metalloenzyme consisting of two separable metalloproteins, the molybdenum-iron protein (MoFeP) and the iron protein (FeP). The MoFeP contains the site of substrate binding and reduction which is thought be at its molybdenum-iron containing cofactor (FeMoco) (6Kim J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1677-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 7Orme-Johnson W.H. Science. 1992; 257: 1639-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The MoFeP also contains a unique [8Fe-(7-8)S] cluster (8Fe or P cluster) which is proposed to mediate the transfer of electrons from the FeP to FeMoco (6Kim J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1677-1682Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 8Bolin J.T. Ronco A. Morgan T.V. Mortenson L.E. Xuong N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Lowe D.J. Fisher K. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The FeP is a homodimeric protein which contains a single [4Fe-4S] cluster bridged between its subunits (10Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The consensus model suggests that the FeP functions to transfer a single electron from its [4Fe-4S] cluster to the MoFeP (probably the 8Fe cluster) along with the concomitant hydrolysis of 2 MgATP for each electron transferred. The resulting oxidized FeP, with 2 MgADP bound, is released from the MoFeP, is reduced by electron carrier proteins and the MgADP is replaced by MgATP (11Hageman R.V. Burris R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The above cycle is repeated to provide sufficient electrons for substrate reduction on the MoFeP. While only the FeP·MoFeP complex will hydrolyze bound MgATP, the FeP alone is known to bind 2 MgATP or 2 MgADP per dimer. The binding of these nucleotides to the FeP induces conformational changes in the FeP which affect the properties of its [4Fe-4S] cluster (4Mortenson L.E. Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Bolin J. Adv. Enzymol. 1993; 67: 299-373PubMed Google Scholar). Significant among these changes is the reduction of the midpoint potential of the cluster from −310 to −430 mV (12Watt G.D. Wang Z.C. Knotts R.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8156-8162Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Zumft W.G. Mortenson L.E. Palmer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the increased accessibility of the cluster to chelators (14Walker G.A. Mortenson L.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Ljones T. Burris R.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting greater solvent exposure. These conformational changes have thus been suggested to be a prerequisite for the intercomponent electron transfer between the FeP and the MoFeP. While the nucleotide induced conformational change of the FeP is required for intercomponent electron transfer, it is not sufficient. Rather, the hydrolysis of MgATP appears to be an absolute requirement for electron transfer. The mechanism of coupling of these two processes is complex and probably involves multiple conformational changes in both FeP and MoFeP (16Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Seefeldt L.C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2073-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of nucleotide utilization by nitrogenase, we are defining the nucleotide binding site on the FeP, residues involved in hydrolysis, and residues responsible for the conformational change. In recent work, we identified an amino acid sequence in the Azotobacter vinelandii FeP that is involved in nucleotide interaction (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence, located near the N terminus of the FeP, is similar to motifs known to function in nucleotide binding in other proteins (i.e. P-loop or Walker A motif) (19Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). Specifically, we demonstrated that the highly conserved lysine at position 15 of this motif plays a major role in both the FeP interaction with the γ-phosphate of MgATP and in the MgATP induced conformational change. We found that changing Lys-15 to the neutral amino acid Gln by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in an FeP that still bound MgADP with normal affinity, but showed a slightly reduced affinity for MgATP binding (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we extend the function of the A. vinelandii FeP Lys-15 by analysis of a protein in which Lys-15 has been changed to Arg. Analysis of the K15R FeP reveal significant differences in nucleotide interactions when compared to the wild type orK15Q FeP. A model is presented explaining a central function for Lys-15 in nucleotide interactions with the FeP. Oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis of the A. vinelandii nitrogenase FeP gene, nifH, was carried out as described previously (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol.

The mutated nifH gene was incorporated into the A. vinelandii chromosome in place of the wild type nifH gene for expression (20Seefeldt L.C. Mortenson L.E.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by using the Biuret assay (22Chromy V. Fischer J. Kulhanek V. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1362-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were prepared as described (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were stained with Coomassie Blue. The chelation of Fe2+ from both the wild type and K15R FeP by α,α′-dipyridyl was performed as described previously (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectrophotometric measurements were done on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The binding of MgATP or MgADP to the reduced wild type or reduced K15R FeP was determined by a modification of an equilibrium column binding technique (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Seefeldt L.C. Mortenson L.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A series of Sephadex G-25 columns (0.7 × 15 cm) were equilibrated with 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 2 mM dithionite and various concentrations of either MgADP (0-300 μM) or MgATP (0-1500 μM). A fixed amount of FeP was loaded onto each column and the columns were developed. The protein containing fractions were collected and the concentration of protein was determined by a modified Biuret method (22Chromy V. Fischer J. Kulhanek V. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1362-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and the concentration of nucleotide was quantified by separation and analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (20Seefeldt L.C. Mortenson L.E. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Midpoint Potential of the [4Fe-4S] Cluster in Wild Type and K15R FeP-The midpoint potentials for the [4Fe-4S]2+/[4Fe-4S]2+ couple in wild type or K15R FeP were determined by microcoulometry as described previously (12Watt G.D.

In an argon filled glove box, reduced FeP containing 2 mM Na2S2O4 was oxidized by adding an excess of 5.6 mM indigo disulfonate just until a blue color remained. The oxidized FeP (FePox) was separated from small molecules by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column (0.7 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8, under argon. The concentration of FePox was determined from its absorption spectrum and an absorption coefficient of 13.3 mM−1 cm−1 at 400 nm (24Anderson G.L. Howard J.B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2118-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Electrochemical reductions were determined for 150-μg aliquots of FePox in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, with 200 mM NaCl including 0.1 mM methyl viologen, 0.1 mM benzyl viologen, and 0.1 mM flavin mononucleotide as mediators. For determination of midpoint potentials with nucleotides, either MgATP or MgADP was added to a final concentration of 3 mM. The number of electrons per protein was plotted against the applied potential ranging from −150 mV to −450 mV at 30 mV increments. The data were fit to the Nernst equation to determine the midpoint reduction potential and the number of electrons per protein. All potentials are relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. Samples to be analyzed by EPR were frozen in liquid nitrogen as described previously (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MgATP was added as a 5-fold molar excess over protein from a stock solution prior to freezing. All spectra were recorded on a Bruker ER200D spectrometer with an Oxford ESR9 cryostat. FeP samples (wild type or K15R; 550 μl of 69 mg·ml−1) were desalted on a Sephadex G-25 column (0.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5. The FeP samples were oxidized by the addition of 20 μl of an anaerobic 20 mM indigo disulfonate solution. The oxidized FeP was separated from small molecules by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column (0.5 × 10 cm) as above. The FePox was diluted to 4 ml with 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and 2 ml of this solution was transferred into a 1-cm path length, argon-purged quartz cuvette fitted with a butyl stopper. MgATP or MgADP were added as a 5-fold molar excess over protein from a stock solution. All spectra were recorded using a Jasco model J-500 spectropolarimeter and were baseline corrected. Most nucleotide binding proteins contain a series of conserved amino acids which are involved in nucleotide interaction (19Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biol. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). The most common of these motifs is the sequence GXXXXGKS/T (Walker A or P-loop) where several of these amino acids have been shown to interact with the phosphate portion of the bound nucleotide (25Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that nitrogenase FeP from a range of bacteria all contain this conserved nucleotide binding motif near the N terminus (26Normand P. Bousquet J. J. Mol. Evol. 1989; 29: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Substitution of the strictly conserved Lys of this sequence in A. vinelandii FeP (Lys-15) with the neutral amino acid Gln resulted in an FeP that was inactive in both electron transfer to the MoFeP and MgATP hydrolysis (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the K15Q protein suggested that this Lys interacted specifically with the γ-phosphate of MgATP and not with the α- or β-phosphates of MgADP and was essential to the nucleotide-induced conformational changes (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent solution of the x-ray crystal structure of the FeP revealed that Lys-15 is located in a loop analogous to the phosphate binding loop in other nucleotide binding proteins and that Lys-15 was located near the phosphates of an adventitiously bound ADP in the structure (10Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure also suggested that Lys-15 might form a salt bridge with Asp-125, which has subsequently been shown to be part of a nucleotide-induced conformational switch (27Wolle D. Dean D.R. Howard J.B. Science. 1992; 258: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To probe the possible significance of this salt bridge, it was of interest to change Lys-15 to the positively charged amino acid arginine. This substitution would have the effect of maintaining the positive charge, but would change the length of the side chain and the possible hydrogen bonding to Asp-125. Like the Gln substituted FeP (K15Q), the arginine substituted FeP (K15R) was found to be inactive in electron transfer, MgATP hydrolysis, and substrate reduction. More detailed analysis of the properties of the K15R FeP revealed, however, several differences from the K15Q FeP which suggested a much broader role for Lys-15 in nucleotide interaction. Given the role of Lys-15 in nucleotide interaction, it was of interest to examine the nature of MgATP interactions with K15R FeP. MgATP binding to wild type FeP results in changes in the environment of the [4Fe-4S] cluster which can be monitored by several techniques. The EPR spectrum of the reduced [4Fe-4S] cluster in wild type FeP has a rhombic line shape with signals arising from both spin 1/2 (g = 2 region) and spin 3/2 (g = 5 region) states (28Orme-Johnson W.H. Hamilton W.D. Jones T.L. Tso M.Y.W. Burris R.H. Shah V.K. Brill W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3142-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 29Zumft W.G. Cretney W.C. Huang T.C. Mortenson L.E. Palmer G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 48: 1525-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Addition of MgATP to the FeP results in a change in both the proportion of spin 1/2 and spin 3/2 signals and in a change in the spin 1/2 signal line shape to axial (Fig. 1). Analysis of the K15R FeP by EPR revealed a normal rhombic EPR spectrum in the absence of nucleotide (Fig. 1), confirming that changing Lys-15 to Arg did not result in conformational changes in the protein that might result in a perturbation of the [4Fe-4S] cluster. Significantly, the addition of MgATP to the K15R FeP did not result in any changes in the EPR spectrum, suggesting a lack of nucleotide-induced conformational changes. MgATP-induced conformational changes in the FeP have also been shown to result in a time-dependent chelation of the Fe2+ from the cluster by iron specific chelators (14Walker G.A. Mortenson L.E. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2382-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Ljones T. Burris R.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This has been interpreted to indicate an exposure to solvent of the [4Fe-4S] cluster as a result of nucleotide binding, allowing chelator access. The kinetics of MgATP-induced Fe2+ chelation from both wild-type and K15R FeP revealed two points. First, the K15R FeP does not show any Fe2+ chelation prior to nucleotide addition, confirming that changing Lys-15 to Arg does not result in conformational changes that expose the [4Fe-4S] cluster to the chelator. Second, the addition of MgATP does not result in Fe2+ chelation from K15R FeP, consistent with a lack of nucleotide-induced conformational changes. The lack of changes in the EPR line shape and the lack of a nucleotide stimulation of Fe2+ chelation for the K15R FeP is similar to results obtained with the K15Q FeP, suggesting in both cases that MgATP binding does not result in conformational changes communicated to the [4Fe-4S] cluster. The lack of a conformational change in the K15Q FeP was not the result of a lack of MgATP binding since K15Q FeP was found to still bind MgATP, although with a somewhat reduced affinity compared to wild-type FeP (33% of wild-type) (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was, therefore, necessary to examine the affinity of MgATP binding to the K15R FeP. Fig. 2(panel A) shows the ratio of MgATP bound per FeP at different MgATP concentrations determined by an equilibrium column binding method. Fitting the wild type FeP data to the Hill equation revealed an apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of 571 μM. Under the same conditions, the K15R FeP showed no detectable binding of MgATP (Fig. 2, panel A). The sigmoidal nature of MgATP binding to the wild type FeP suggests cooperativity between the binding of nucleotides to the two binding sites, as has been previously suggested (15Ljones T. Burris R.H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 1866-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Hageman R.V. Orme-Johnson W.H. Burris R.H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Watt G.D. Burns A. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The fit to the Hill equation resulted in a cooperativity factor of 2.1, supporting strong cooperativity in the binding of the two nucleotides. Given the strong cooperativity, the observed apparent dissociation constant (Kd) represents the product of the two true dissociation constants. We previously found that the affinity of the K15Q FeP for MgADP binding was nearly identical to that observed for wild-type FeP (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2(panel B) shows the ratio of MgADP bound per FeP at different MgADP concentrations determined by an equilibrium column binding method. Fitting the wild type FeP data to the Hill equation revealed an apparent Kd of 143 μM. Again, the sigmoidal nature of the data suggested cooperativity in the binding of MgADP to the two binding sites, which was supported by a value of n = 2.0 for the fit to the Hill equation. In contrast to the binding of MgADP to the wild type FeP, the K15R FeP showed an extremely low affinity for MgADP even at concentrations as high as 300 μM. This extremely low affinity for MgADP contrasts with the normal affinity observed for the K15Q FeP (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control binding experiments in which Mg2+ was omitted revealed no detectable binding for either the wild type or K15R FePs. Previous reports on the affinities of MgATP and MgADP binding to the reduced wild type FeP have suggested apparent dissociation constants ranging from 220 to 1710 μM for MgATP and 44 to 91 μM for MgADP (32Yates M.G. Stacey G. Burris R.H. Evans H.J. Biological Nitrogen Fixation. Chapman and Hall, New York1991: 685-735Google Scholar). The disparity in these reported values probably reflect limitations in the various methods that have been used to determine these values. We have found that particular care must be taken in the use of equilibrium dialysis methods. During the 6 or more hours needed to reach equilibrium, we have found significant hydrolysis of MgATP (up to 20%) to MgADP. The presence of MgADP in the binding assay would have a significant effect on the apparent binding constant for MgATP. In addition, because A. vinelandii FeP can self-oxidize dithionite (33Cordewener J. Haaker H. Veeger C. FEBS Lett. 1983; 132: 47-54Google Scholar), the oxidized state of the FeP must be used. Advantages of the equilibrium column binding technique described in this work include the short time required for the attainment of equilibrium. This allows the maintenance of dithionite in the column buffer and thus the reduced state of the FeP. In addition, the short time reduces the amount of MgATP hydrolysis. The high performance liquid chromatography method used to detect the nucleotide concentrations provides a sensitive way to detect any hydrolysis of MgATP to MgADP or MgAMP. Using the column binding technique, nucleotide hydrolysis was determined to be less than 4%. Binding of MgADP to the FeP has been shown to induce changes in its [4Fe-4S] cluster (12Watt G.D. Wang Z.C. Knotts R.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8156-8162Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Stephens P.J. McKenna C.E. Smith B.E. Nguyen H.T. McKenna M.C. Thomson A.J. Devlin F. Jones J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2585-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These changes are clearly different from those induced by MgATP. For example, addition of MgADP does not result in EPR line shape changes or in chelation of the iron from the cluster. MgADP binding does result in changes in the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the oxidized FeP which is different from changes induced by MgATP binding. Likewise, MgADP binding results in a change in the midpoint reduction potential of the [4Fe-4S] cluster from −310 to −430 mV (12Watt G.D. Wang Z.C. Knotts R.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8156-8162Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We examined the K15R FeP by both CD spectroscopy and microcoulometry as additional ways to probe both the integrity of the [4Fe-4S] cluster and as more sensitive ways to detect MgADP-induced conformational changes. Fig. 3 (panel A) shows reduction curves for wild type FeP in the absence and presence of either MgATP or MgADP. From the fits of the data to the Nernst equation, midpoint reduction potentials of −290, −420, and −430 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode were determined, respectively. In all cases, the maximum number of electrons per protein were found to be between 0.9 and 1.0, consistent with a single electron reduction of the [4Fe-4S] cluster from the 2+ to the 1+ state. The results for reduction of the K15R FeP are shown in Fig. 3, panel B. In the absence of nucleotides, the midpoint reduction potential for the K15R FeP was found to be −290 mV, similar to the wild type FeP. This data confirms that changing Lys-15 to Arg does not result in detectable changes in the [4Fe-4S] cluster. In contrast to the results for wild type FeP, the inclusion of MgATP or MgADP to K15R FeP was found to have no effect on the midpoint potential of the K15R FeP (Fig. 3, panel B). Previous studies have shown that the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of FeP in the visible wavelength region is a sensitive measure of the environment around the [4Fe-4S] cluster (34Stephens P.J. McKenna C.E. Smith B.E. Nguyen H.T. McKenna M.C. Thomson A.J. Devlin F. Jones J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2585-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The addition of MgATP or MgADP to the FeP results in significantly different CD spectra, indicating different conformational changes. Fig. 4 (panel A) shows the CD spectra for oxidized, wild-type FeP both with and without added MgADP or MgATP. As reported (34Stephens P.J. McKenna C.E. Smith B.E. Nguyen H.T. McKenna M.C. Thomson A.J. Devlin F. Jones J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2585-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the binding of nucleotides results in significantly different CD spectra. A similar experiment with K15R FeP (Fig. 4, panel B) revealed that in the absence of added nucleotides, the oxidized K15R FeP CD spectrum was nearly identical to the oxidized wild-type FeP. These results support the conclusion that changing Lys-15 to Arg does not change the environment around the [4Fe-4S] cluster, even when the [4Fe-4S] cluster is in the oxidized state. As predicted, the addition of MgATP or MgADP to the K15R FeP did not result in significant changes in the CD spectrum. This supports the conclusion that MgATP and MgADP do not induce conformational changes within the K15R FeP. A small decrease in ellipticity was observed at about 360 nm for the K15R FeP in the presence of MgADP. MgATP binding and hydrolysis are an integral part of the substrate reduction mechanism of nitrogenase (4Mortenson L.E. Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Bolin J. Adv. Enzymol. 1993; 67: 299-373PubMed Google Scholar, 16Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The results presented in this work support a model in which Lys-15 of A. vinelandii FeP plays a central role in nucleotide interactions with nitrogenase, functioning in binding of both MgATP and MgADP and in the conformational changes induced by both nucleotides. MgATP interactions with nitrogenase include MgATP binding to the FeP followed by MgATP hydrolysis by the FeP·MoFeP complex. The FeP alone is known to bind 2 MgATP, one per subunit. This binding to the FeP results in conformational changes which appear to make the FeP competent for interaction with the MoFeP. The MgATP-induced conformational changes have been monitored by several methods, most of which detect changes in the [4Fe-4S] cluster (12Watt G.D. Wang Z.C. Knotts R.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8156-8162Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Zumft W.G. Cretney W.C. Huang T.C. Mortenson L.E. Palmer G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1974; 249: 6356-6358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the x-ray crystal structure and previous site-directed mutagenesis studies on FeP, it is known that the nucleotide-induced conformational changes within the FeP must be communicated over a distance of at least 19 Å from the nucleotide binding site to the [4Fe-4S] cluster (10Georgiadis M.M. Komiya H. Chakrabarti P. Woo D. Kornuc J.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These changes have been suggested to be a prerequisite to the correct docking of the FeP to the MoFeP prior to MgATP hydrolysis and intercomponent electron transfer (16Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 17Seefeldt L.C. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2073-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Once the FeP·MoFeP complex is formed, the hydrolysis of MgATP is somehow linked to the transfer of the electron from the FeP to the MoFeP and possibly directly to substrate reduction (16Howard J.B. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanisms for how MgATP activates the FeP for binding to the MoFeP and how MgATP hydrolysis is linked to electron transfer remains largely undefined. It is becoming clear, however, that conformational changes within the FeP, and probably within the MoFeP, play an integral part in this mechanism. In our previous work, the function of Lys-15 was probed by analysis of an FeP in which this residue was changed to the neutral amino acid glutamine (K15Q). The K15Q FeP was found to bind MgADP with normal affinity, clearly suggesting that the side chain of Lys-15 did not participate in MgADP binding (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, MgATP binding was affected, decreasing to 35% of wild type. This suggested that Lys-15 functioned in interaction with the γ-phosphate of MgATP. The K15Q FeP did not undergo conformational changes as detected by EPR or α,α′-dipyridyl chelation. This lead to the conclusion that Lys-15 played a central role in nucleotide-induced conformational changes. Analysis of the x-ray structure of the FeP suggests that the ε-amino group of Lys-15 forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate of Asp-125 (Fig. 5A). Asp-125 is part of a second nucleotide binding pattern often observed in nucleotide binding proteins (Walker B) (18Seefeldt L.C. Morgan T.V. Dean D.R. Mortenson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6680-6688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wolle D. Dean D.R. Howard J.B. Science. 1992; 258: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Changing the conserved Asp-125 to Glu (D125E) was found to have dramatic effects on nucleotide-induced conformational changes within the FeP, suggesting that Asp-125 could provide a linkage from the nucleotide binding site to the [4Fe-4S] cluster (27Wolle D. Dean D.R. Howard J.B. Science. 1992; 258: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This linkage has been suggested to be mediated through the amino acids between Asp-125 and Cys-132, a ligand to the [4Fe-4S] cluster (27Wolle D. Dean D.R. Howard J.B. Science. 1992; 258: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The results presented in this work on the properties of an FeP in which Lys-15 has been changed to an Arg can be integrated into the current model of the phosphate binding site and the function of Lys-15 in this interaction. In the absence of a bound nucleotide, Lys-15 and Asp-125 would be expected to form a salt bridge, neutralizing the charged residues in the interior of the FeP and stabilizing conformational changes mediated through Asp-125 (Fig. 5A). Upon binding of MgATP to the FeP, the salt bridge between Lys-15 and Asp-125 would be expected to be broken, with Lys-15 now interacting with the negatively charged phosphate groups (β- and γ-) and Asp-125 with the Mg2+ bound to the γ- and β-phosphates of MgATP. The movement of Asp-125 to accommodate the bound nucleotide could result in a conformational change in the [4Fe-4S] cluster by changes in the relative position of Cys-132 (27Wolle D. Dean D.R. Howard J.B. Science. 1992; 258: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The K15Q FeP would not be expected to form this salt bridge to the Asp-125. To probe the potential importance of this salt bridge, it was of interest to change Lys-15 to the positively charged amino acid Arg. This change would maintain the positive charge, but would change the nature of the interaction. A significant finding of the present work is that changing Lys-15 to Arg in the FeP greatly reduces K15R FePs affinity for both MgATP or MgADP. In addition, changing Lys-15 to Arg was found to prevent nucleotide-induced conformational changes. These results can be integrated into the model outlined above. Arg-15 is expected to form a salt bridge with Asp-125, as did the wild type Lys-15 (Fig. 5B). The nature of the interactions of Arg-15 with Asp-125 and with nucleotides is, however, clearly different from Lys-15. One possibility is that Arg-15 forms a stronger salt bridge with Asp-125, preventing the opening of the phosphate site to accommodate the phosphate groups of the incoming nucleotide. Consistent with this model, the guanidino group of Arg is more basic than the ε-amino group of Lys and also has the potential to form a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of Asp as well as a charge interaction. The net effect could be to “lock” the active site closed, preventing either MgATP or MgADP from binding. Another related explanation is that to maintain an optimal distance for the salt bridge between Asp and the longer Arg, the protein backbone must shift to accommodate the 1-Å increase in length. This movement could move other amino acids critical for nucleotide binding out of place, thus having multiple effects on binding energetics. It should be noted, however, that no conformational changes in the EPR, CD, or midpoint potential of the cluster could be detected for the K15R FeP, suggesting that any conformational changes resulting from the change of Lys-15 to Arg are either very small or confined to the environment around the phosphate site. The formation of this tighter interaction between Arg-15 and Asp-125 could stop the nucleotide-induced conformational change proposed to be mediated through Asp-125. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for a central role of Lys-15 of A. vinelandii FeP in interaction with both MgADP and MgATP and suggests a possible mode of interaction between Lys-15 and Asp-125."

Interestingly, extracts prepared from growth-restricted mammalian cells have an impaired capacity for RNA pol I transcription due to depletion or modification of an essential transcription factor (1Gokal P.K.

Cavanaugh A.H. Thompson Jr., A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2536-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A negative biosynthetic response to cycloheximide administration has been observed both in mammalian cells (1Gokal P.K. Cavanaugh A.H. Thompson Jr., A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2536-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, albeit to variable extents, also in yeast (3Gross K.J. Pogo A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 568-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shulman R.W. Sripati C.E. Warner J.R. J. Biol.

Soluble extracts derived from mouse cells, either treated with cycloheximide or grown into stationary phase, mimic the in vivo response and down-regulation of RNA pol III transcription in these cells has been shown to result mainly from a reduced activity of the general class III transcription factor TFIIIB (7Tower J. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The same transcription factor has been found to be involved in the down-regulation of class III gene transcription that occurs in differentiating mouse F9 cells and in frog oocytes undergoing mitosis (8White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 9Gottesfeld J.M. Wolf V.J. Dang T. Forbes D.J. Hartl P. Science. 1994; 263: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These findings thus raise the possibility that TFIIIB may represent a general target for the negative modulation of RNA pol III transcription in eukaryotic cells. In view of the recent discovery that TFIIIB from various organisms is a multiprotein transcription factor (reviewed in Ref. 10White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-147Google Scholar), a further question of interest concerns the identification of the TFIIIB component(s) that is either modified or destabilized under protein synthesis inhibitory conditions. The highest resolution of the TFIIIB complex has been achieved, so far, for the transcription factor from yeast. In this system, two distinct polypeptides, TFIIIB70 (also known as BRF, TDS4, or PCF4) and the TATA box-binding protein (TBP), plus a fraction (B″) that is enriched in a 90-kDa polypeptide have been shown to be necessary and sufficient to reconstitute TFIIIB activity (11Buratowski S. Zhou H. Cell. 1992; 71: 221-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Colbert T. Hahn S.

Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). A fourth component, TFIIIE, which is also required to reconstitute in vitro class III transcription in the presence of a partially purified TFIIIB fraction, has recently been resolved in our laboratory and found to co-fractionate with highly purified B″ fractions (18Dieci G. Duimio L. Coda-Zabetta F. Sprague K.U. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11199-11207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notwithstanding the availability of cloned or highly resolved class III transcription components, tRNA and 5 S RNA synthesis have not yet been analyzed in crude extracts of cycloheximide-treated yeast cells, and nothing is known about the molecular events underlying negative modulation of RNA pol III transcription under conditions of protein synthesis inhibition. We are interested in defining the targets and the mechanisms of inactivation of yeast pol III transcription in response to cycloheximide-induced protein synthesis inhibition. We were also intrigued by the possibility that TFIIIE might be involved in such response. The effect of cycloheximide upon tRNA and 5 S RNA synthesis has thus been initially re-examined under in vivo pulse labeling conditions. We have found that the rates of tRNA and 5 S RNA synthesis decrease with apparent half-times of 20 and 10 min, respectively, in cycloheximide-treated cells and that in vitro transcription of a tRNA gene by extracts of treated cells faithfully mimics the in vivo response. Only TFIIIB activity is severely impaired in these extracts, and a selective loss of TFIIIB70 and B″ activities, but not TBP activity, fully accounts for the observed inactivation. The diploid, protease-deficient S. cerevisiae strain RH804C775D (α lys2 leu2 pep4-3/a leu2 trp1::URA3 gal2 pep 4-3, a gift of H. Riezman, University of Basel, Switzerland) was used throughout this work. Cells were grown at 30°C in phosphate-depleted YEPD medium (19Warner J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide (Fluka, 10 μg/ml) was added to yeast cultures grown to a density of 107 cells/ml; mock-treated aliquots of the same cultures were used as controls. For pulse labeling experiments (20Neigeborn L. Warner J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4179-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), aliquots of either cycloheximide-treated or control cultures (a total of 108 cells each) were collected by centrifugation at various times after cycloheximide addition and resuspended in 0.5 ml of the corresponding growth medium. Cells were then incubated for 10 min in the presence of radioactive [32P]orthophosphate (20-30 μCi, 8500 Ci/mmol), washed twice with ice-cold growth medium, and frozen in liquid nitrogen in preparation for RNA extraction. To determine the time course of radioactive phosphate accumulation by either control or cycloheximide-treated cells, samples were taken at 10-min intervals from a scaled-up incubation mixture, washed twice with ice-cold growth medium, and counted. Total RNA was extracted with the hot phenol procedure (21Wise J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After the addition of ammonium acetate (3.75 M, final concentration) and ethanol (2.5 volumes), samples were kept on dry ice for 20 min, and RNA was collected by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were then washed once with 70% ethanol, dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and used for either spectrophotometric, electrophoretic, or chromatographic analyses. RNA samples (15 μg of total RNA) were fractionated on 6% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea gels. The gels were first stained with ethidium bromide to monitor total amounts of the different RNA species; they were subsequently exposed overnight for autoradiography, followed by the quantitation of individual RNA bands by Cerenkov counting. Poly(A+) RNA was resolved by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose (Boehringer) following the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids pUCLeu3, containing a yeast tRNALeu3 gene, pPM16, containing a yeast tRNASer gene, and pUC9-5S, containing the yeast 5 S rRNA gene (from P. A. Weil, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN), were used as templates for in vitro transcription reactions. Plasmids pET3b(rTFIIDY) (22Burton N. Cavallini B. Kanno M. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Protein Expr. Purif. 1991; 2: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and pSH360 (12Colbert T. Hahn S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) were used to express yeast TBP and TFIIIB70 in Escherichia coli and were kindly provided by J. M. Egly (INSERM, Strasbourg, France) and S. Hahn (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Plasmid pETIIIA (23Ottonello S. Ballabeni A. Soncini C. Dieci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was used for the expression of yeast TFIIIA. Nuclear extracts were prepared from either control or cycloheximide-treated cells grown to a final density of 1-1.5 × 107 cells/ml (18Dieci G. Duimio L. Coda-Zabetta F. Sprague K.U. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11199-11207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ammonium sulfate concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 0.9 M were tested for their nuclear extraction ability. The resulting extracts were found to exhibit essentially identical in vitro transcriptional activities (see below), and a final salt concentration of 0.65 M was routinely used for nuclear extract preparation. Transcription factor fractions (TFIIIB, TFIIIC, and TFIIIE) and polymerase were partially purified from control extracts as described previously (18Dieci G. Duimio L. Coda-Zabetta F. Sprague K.U. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11199-11207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fraction B″ was extracted from chromatin pellets and partially purified on BioRex 70 (Bio-Rad) according to Kassavetis et al.(17Kassavetis G.A. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P. Colbert T. Hahn S. Blanco J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 1055-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Recombinant yeast TFIIIA was expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity as described previously (23Ottonello S. Ballabeni A. Soncini C. Dieci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recombinant yeast TBP and TFIIIB70 were purified from E. coli-soluble lysates using modifications of previously described procedures (12Colbert T. Hahn S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 22Burton N. Cavallini B. Kanno M. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Protein Expr. Purif. 1991; 2: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After an initial fractionation on DEAE-Sephacel and heparin-Ultrogel (22Burton N. Cavallini B. Kanno M. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Protein Expr. Purif. 1991; 2: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), rTBP was purified to near homogeneity by gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA-54 (IBF, 2 × 150 cm column) equilibrated, and eluted with 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mM EDTA and 0.5 M KCl at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min. Histidine-tagged rTFIIIB70 was purified to about 50% homogeneity by chromatography on Ni2+-NTA agarose (Quiagen) under native conditions, using 250 mM imidazole dissolved in 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 0.3 M NaCl, 1.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, plus protease inhibitors (1 μM each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM benzamidine) as eluent. The in vitro complementation of extracts derived from TBP mutant yeast cells (YSB67 strain, 24Buratowski S. Zhou H. Science. 1992; 255: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and the transcriptional stimulation of extracts prepared from wild type haploid cells (12Colbert T. Hahn S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) were initially used to assay for rTBP and rTFIIIB70, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Standard transcription assay mixtures contained 80 fmol of template DNA, 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 120 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 600 μM each of ATP, GTP, and CTP, 25 μM UTP, and 5-10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol). Transcription assays were carried out in a final volume of 20 or 37 μl, in the case of either crude extracts or variously reconstituted transcription systems. The amounts of extracts, fractions, and purified components employed for each experiment are indicated in the figure legends. Multiple round transcription reactions were incubated for 20-30 min at room temperature. The concentration of transcriptionally active components in either partially purified transcription factor fractions and in recombinant transcription factor preparations was determined by single round transcription assays as described previously (18Dieci G. Duimio L. Coda-Zabetta F. Sprague K.U. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11199-11207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kassavetis G.A. Riggs D.L. Negri R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2551-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of a solution containing 4% (v/v) SDS and 5 mg/ml of carrier RNA (Sigma, type R-6625 T6). After phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, RNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels as described previously (18Dieci G. Duimio L. Coda-Zabetta F. Sprague K.U. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11199-11207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription products were visualized by autoradiography of wet gels and were quantitated by measuring Cerenkov radiation in gel slices. Equal amounts of total protein from either extracts of cycloheximide-treated cells or from the corresponding control extracts were electrophoresed, along with molecular weight markers, on polyacrylamide-SDS gels (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, BA-85) and immunoblotting were carried out as described by Harlow and Lane (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). TFIIIB70 was detected with an antiserum raised against the partially purified recombinant yeast protein (kindly provided by F. Pugh, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA). Polyclonal antibodies against yeast TBP were a gift of D. Hawley, University of Oregon, Eugene, OR. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions to detect antigene-bound primary antibodies. Before analyzing RNA pol III transcription in cell-free extracts of cycloheximide-treated cells, we re-examined the effect of this protein synthesis inhibitor on tRNA and 5 S RNA synthesis under in vivo pulse-labeling conditions. To this end, exponentially growing yeast cells were treated for various periods of time with cycloheximide, at a concentration (10 μg/ml) which reversibly blocked both protein synthesis and cell growth within a few minutes from its addition. Following pulse labeling of control and cycloheximide-treated cells with [32P]orthophosphate (10 min), radioactively labeled RNA species were resolved by either polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or oligo(dT)-cellulose fractionation. As shown in Fig. 1 (panels A and B), radioactive phosphate incorporation into 5 S RNA and tRNAs decreased with apparent half-times of about 10 and 20 min upon cycloheximide administration, and it leveled off at 10 and 15% of the corresponding control values after about 2 h. Under identical experimental conditions, labeling of total poly(A+) and poly(A−) RNA, as estimated from the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into RNA species that either bound to or flowed through oligo(dT)-cellulose, diminished with apparent half-times of 90 and 5 min, respectively (data not shown). Consistent with the fast decline of poly(A−) RNA synthesis, labeling of the processed 5.8 S rRNA species was also rapidly inhibited in growth-arrested cells (Fig. 1A). The observation that the in vivo pulse labeling of distinct classes of RNAs decreases in growth-arrested cells with considerably different kinetics, together with the fact that radioactive phosphate accumulation proceeded linearly for at least 30 min after cycloheximide addition (data not shown), indicates that the effect of cycloheximide does not merely result from a reduced specific activity of the intracellular nucleotide pool. Moreover, no decrease in the steady state amounts of either 5 S RNA or tRNAs, as estimated from the intensity of ethidium bromide staining of the same gel used for pulse labeling analysis, was detected after 3 h of cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 1C). The effect of cycloheximide on 5 S RNA and tRNA accumulation thus occurs primarily at the level of transcription. To begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the down-regulation of pol III transcription in cycloheximide growth-arrested cells, extracts were prepared from cell cultures that had been exposed to the inhibitor for either 1.5 or 3 h under the above described experimental conditions, as well as from parallel cultures of mock-treated cells. Extracts were prepared from the same number of cells and contained nearly identical amounts of total protein. Parallel transcription assays were carried out with increasing amounts of either extract, using the yeast tRNALeu3 gene and the 5 S rRNA gene as templates. As shown in Fig. 2A, extracts of cells harvested at different times from cycloheximide addition became increasingly less competent for tRNA gene transcription with a 70% inactivation after 1.5 h and almost no detectable activity after 3 h. A different in vitro response was observed in the case of 5 S RNA synthesis, with practically no variation of transcriptional activity after 1.5 h of treatment and a nearly complete loss of transcription after 3 h. Extracts derived from treated cells thus appear to mimic cycloheximide-induced down-regulation of pol III transcription. However, at variance with tRNA gene in vitro transcription, which faithfully reproduces the in vivo response (cf. Fig. 1B and 2A), the time course of inactivation of in vitro 5 S RNA transcription was found to be slower than that measured in intact cells (cf. Fig. 1B and 2B). As verified by experiments in which a control extract was preincubated with cycloheximide prior to transcription, the impaired transcriptional capacity of extracts prepared from treated cells is not due to a direct effect of the inhibitor on the transcription machinery (data not shown). Furthermore, extracts of cycloheximide-treated cells did not inhibit control extracts when the two were mixed together prior to in vitro transcription (Fig. 3). This result indicates that the transcriptional impairment of extracts derived from treated cells is not due to the presence of a diffusible inhibitor and that these extracts do not trans-inactivate any transcriptional component of the control extract. Rather, it argues that inactive extracts have reduced amounts of a positive activity that is required for tRNA and 5 S RNA transcription. To identify the class III component(s) which is responsible for the cycloheximide-induced down-regulation of pol III transcription, we initially tried to restore tRNA gene transcription by extracts of treated cells with the addition of individual transcription factors partially purified from control cells. As shown in Fig. 4, supplementation of either TFIIIC, TFIIIE, or polymerase to extracts of treated cells had no effect on transcription (cf.lane 2 with lanes 6-8). In contrast, the addition of partially purified TFIIIB fully restored transcription (lanes 3-5). Similar experiments with the 5 S rRNA gene showed that TFIIIB also restores 5 S RNA transcription (data not shown). TFIIIB thus appears to be primarily responsible for the impairment of tRNA synthesis that occurs in cycloheximide-treated cells, and a reduced activity of this component also accounts for the delayed decline of in vitro 5 S RNA transcription. An intrinsic restraint of “add back” experiments is their inability to detect even significant variations of components other than the one that is limiting for transcription. We thus assayed the activity of individual class III transcription components by supplying graded amounts of extracts from either control or cycloheximide-treated cells to partially reconstituted transcription systems providing an excess of all components except for the one being tested. As shown in Table I, TFIIIB activity is about 10-fold reduced in extracts of treated cells, whereas nearly identical TFIIIA, TFIIIC, TFIIIE, and polymerase activities are present in either type of extract.Table ITranscription factor activities in extracts of control and cycloheximide-treated cells While confirming the results of the add back experiment as to the primary involvement of TFIIIB in the transcriptional response to cycloheximide, the latter data show that the reduced activity of this component parallels the decrease of total transcription capacity measured in unfractionated extracts. tRNA and 5 S rRNA transcription by control extracts is limited by different activities, either TFIIIB or TFIIIA, yet no transcriptional component other than TFIIIB has been found to vary between control extracts and extracts of treated cells. This selectivity of inactivation also indicates that the effect of cycloheximide does not merely result from a generalized alteration of the nuclear extractability of class III transcription components. Indeed, practically identical results as to the impaired transcriptional capacity of extracts derived from treated cells were obtained when varying the ammonium sulfate concentration used for nuclei extraction from 0.5 to 0.9 M (data not shown). Yeast TFIIIB is a multiprotein complex constituted by at least three distinct components (reviewed in Ref. 29Willis I.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To determine which of these components is negatively modulated in cycloheximide-treated cells, we first set up a reconstituted transcription system in which TFIIIB is replaced by recombinant TFIIIB70 and TBP, plus a fraction, B″, that was partially purified from yeast nuclear pellets (Fig. 5A, lanes 3-9). The latter fraction was found to contain sizeable amounts of cross-contaminating TFIIIE (data not shown). At variance with its transcriptional requirement in the presence of the native TFIIIB complex (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 2), TFIIIE thus turned out to be dispensable for transcription in the presence of fraction B″ (Fig. 5A, lanes 3 and 6). On the contrary, TFIIIB70, TBP, and B″ were all required to reconstitute TFIIIB activity, and the level of tRNA transcription efficiency achieved with internally calibrated amounts of these three components was comparable to that obtained in the presence of native TFIIIB and TFIIIE (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, neither TBP, B″, nor a combination of these two components could restore the activity of an extract prepared from cycloheximide-treated cells. Only a slight stimulation of transcription was observed with either TFIIIB70 or TFIIIB70 plus TBP (cf. lane 2 with lanes 4 and 5), and essentially identical results were obtained upon the additional supplementation of TFIIIE (data not shown). In contrast, the same extract was restored to about 90% of the control activity by the addition of TFIIIB70 and B″ (cf.lanes 1 and 9), with only a little additional recovery upon the further supplementation of TBP (lane 11). TFIIIB70 and a component of fraction B″ thus appear to be the selective targets of the cycloheximide-induced inactivation of TFIIIB. This conclusion was further supported by titration experiments, which showed that largely reduced (7-10-fold) B″ and TFIIIB70 activities, but essentially unchanged levels of TBP activity, are present in extracts of treated cells (data not shown). The observed inactivation of TFIIIB70 and B″ may result from their selective destabilization under conditions of protein synthesis inhibition. Alternatively, it may derive from a cycloheximide-induced modification of these components, leading to a substantial impairment of their transcription factor activity. To begin to distinguish between these two possibilities, we used anti-TFIIIB70 antibodies for a Western immunoblot analysis of control and cycloheximide extracts. TBP was used as an internal reference for this analysis and, in agreement with the results of previous titration experiments, it was found not to vary between the two types of extract (Fig. 6A). In contrast, under identical experimental conditions, a substantial depletion of the TFIIIB70 polypeptide was detected in extracts derived from cycloheximide-treated cells (Fig. 6B). We have found that yeast pol III transcription, though appreciably less sensitive to cycloheximide-induced inactivation than pol I transcription, is similarly down-regulated under conditions of protein synthesis inhibition. The results of our in vivo pulse labeling analysis are in keeping with the previously reported differential sensitivity of these two transcription systems to cycloheximide (1Gokal P.K. Cavanaugh A.H. Thompson Jr., A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2536-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gross K.J. Pogo A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 568-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Shulman R.W. Sripati C.E. Warner J.R. J. Biol.

In particular, tRNA transcription declines under in vivo conditions with an apparent half-time about 4-fold longer than the corresponding half-time for pol I transcription. In turn, pol III transcription has been found to decline 4.5-9-fold more rapidly than pol II transcription, indicating that the effect of cycloheximide is not due to a generalized destabilization of the RNA biosynthetic machinery. Furthermore, the steady state levels of tRNAs and 5 S RNA do not change following cycloheximide addition, as if their turnover rates were considerably slowed-down under growth-arrested conditions. A similar divergence between the rate of synthesis and the steady state level of various class III transcripts has been observed in other systems, and the regulation of tRNA half-life has previously been reported (10White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-147Google Scholar, 30Abelson H.T. Johnson L.F. Penman S. Green H. Cell. 1974; 1: 161-165Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (149) Google Scholar, and references therein). By enabling cells to maintain a level of essential pol III products that is sufficient to support basal cellular functions, this mechanism would explain the complete reversibility of the cycloheximide-induced growth arrest as observed under our experimental conditions. Extracts of cycloheximide-treated cells programmed with a cloned tRNA gene mimic the in vivo response to protein synthesis inhibition. The same extracts did not faithfully reproduce the earlier decline of 5 S RNA synthesis that was observed under in vivo labeling conditions. Since TFIIIA has the ability to bind both the 5 S gene and the 5 S RNA transcript (10White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-147Google Scholar), this discordance of behavior may result, for example, from an in vivo shortage of transcriptionally competent TFIIIA, due to a reduced availability of the ribosomal 5 S RNA binding protein YL3 in cycloheximide growth-arrested cells (20Neigeborn L. Warner J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4179-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 31Brow D.A. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13953-13958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may reflect a predominant chromatin effect under in vivo conditions, arising from the peculiar chromosomal location of yeast 5 S rRNA genes within the “spacer” regions interposed between individual rDNA transcription units (32Philippsen P. Thomas M. Kramer R.A. Davis R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 123: 387-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Our present in vitro data do not allow distinguishing between these two possibilities, and the only transcription component that has been found to be affected by cycloheximide treatment is TFIIIB. However, the observation that the level of TFIIIA activity is initially lower than the level of TFIIIB (Table I), at least accounts for the delayed involvement of TFIIIB in the in vitro detected inactivation of 5 S RNA transcription. Similar to what has previously been found in the case of growth-restricted mouse cells (7Tower J. Sollner-Webb B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), TFIIIB is the only class III transcription component whose activity is severely impaired in extracts of cycloheximide-treated yeast cells. The observation that an identical class III component mediates a negative transcriptional response in so diverse organisms supports the view that TFIIIB may indeed be a general target for eukaryotic pol III down-regulation. The selective impairment of TFIIIB activity under protein synthesis inhibitory conditions is consistent with the key role that this component is known to play in transcription initiation (33Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Cell. 1990; 60: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In various mammalian systems, TFIIIC has previously been shown to be implicated in both positive and negative pol III regulatory events (reviewed in Ref. 10White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-147Google Scholar). At variance with TFIIIC, however, TFIIIB inactivation has the potential ability not only to prevent transcription complex formation, but also to abolish initiation from preassembled transcription complexes. Particularly interesting, in this regard, is the involvement of TFIIIB in controlling the differential expression of constitutive and silk gland-specific tRNAAla genes in silkworms (34Sullivan H.S. Young L.S. White C.N. Sprague K.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in the down-regulation of pol III transcription during differentiation of mouse F9 cells (8White R.J. Stott D. Rigby P.W. Cell. 1989; 59: 1081-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). TFIIIB is also involved in the repression of class III gene transcription that occurs in Xenopus oocytes as they go through mitosis (9Gottesfeld J.M. Wolf V.J. Dang T. Forbes D.J. Hartl P. Science. 1994; 263: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The latter event has been found to be mediated by the phosphorylation of a TFIIIB subunit (9Gottesfeld J.M. Wolf V.J. Dang T. Forbes D.J. Hartl P. Science. 1994; 263: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but the specific TFIIIB components that are involved in the above mentioned negative modulations are not yet known. TFIIIB has recently been shown also to mediate an up-regulation event that is induced by phorbol esters in Drosophila Schneider S2 cells (35Garber M.E. Vilalta A. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this case, stimulation of pol III transcription correlates with an increased level of TBP, but no other TFIIIB component has been examined. Based on the high resolution that has recently been achieved for the yeast TFIIIB complex (reviewed in Ref. 29Willis I.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), our studies represent the first analysis of the negative modulation of individual components of a multiprotein class III transcription complex, under conditions that determine an in vivo detectable inactivation of transcription. Two TFIIIB components, TFIIIB70 and B″, are the specific targets of the pol III transcriptional response to protein synthesis inhibition. We do not yet know whether a qualitative or a quantitative variation is responsible for the observed inactivation of B″, but the latter possibility appears to hold in the case of TFIIIB70. In fact, Western immunoblot analysis has revealed a substantial depletion of the TFIIIB70 polypeptide in extracts of cycloheximide growth-arrested cells. In the same extracts, TBP remains essentially constant, and it is capable of interacting with exogenously added TFIIIB70 and B″ to reconstitute control levels of in vitro transcription activity. Since TBP is known to direct transcription by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases (10White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 1-147Google Scholar, 14Cormack B.P. Struhl K. Cell. 1992; 69: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 15Schultz M.C. Reeder R.H. Hahn S.

Tjian R. Cell. 1992; 68: 965-976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), its marked stability under protein synthesis inhibitory conditions is by itself quite remarkable. It is consistent both with the differential cycloheximide sensitivity of the three transcriptional machineries evidenced by our in vivo pulse labeling analysis, and with the fact that a component other than TBP has been found to be involved in the down-regulation of mouse RNA pol I transcription under protein synthesis inhibitory conditions (5Schnapp A. Pfleiderer C. Rosenbauer H. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2857-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The inactivation of TFIIIB70 appears to be even more relevant if one considers that this particular TFIIIB component has previously been shown to limit pol III transcription in intact yeast cells (13Lopez De Leon A. Librizzi M. Puglia K. Willis I. Cell. 1992; 71: 211-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In addition, both genetic and biochemical data have demonstrated the existence of a fairly stable interaction between TFIIIB70 and TBP (11Buratowski S. Zhou H. Cell. 1992; 71: 221-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Colbert T. Hahn S. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 1940-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 37Poon D. Weil P.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2282-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a computer sequence analysis of these two TFIIIB components detects the presence of a degradation promoting signal (“PEST,” 39Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar) in TFIIIB70, but not in TBP.2( 2S. Ottonello and R. Percudani, unpublished observations.) The trans-recognition and targeted proteolysis of specific components of multiprotein complexes has recently been reported (reviewed in Ref. 40Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). It will thus be important to establish whether similar mechanisms also pertain to the selective inactivation of the TFIIIB70 and B″ components of yeast TFIIIB.

The activity was shown to increase by 5-fold the rate for this splicing step, whereas it had no effect on the rate of the first step. The activity was not affected by treatment with micrococcal nuclease, whereas it is sensitive to heating to 55°C, suggesting that it is not dependent on an RNA, but more likely is a protein. The second step activity was separated from other factors required for the first step and from PSF, a splicing factor thought to have a second step activity.

Mutagenesis of the putative flavinylation base (His-29 to Gln-29) did not prevent flavinylation, but the relative proportion of flavinylated product was substantially less than that seen for the recombinant wild-type enzyme. No flavinylation products were observed for a double mutant (His-29 to Cys-29; Cys-30 to His-30), in which the positions of the putative flavinylation base and cysteine nucleophile were exchanged.

This cell specificity results from glial-specific expression of viral early genes (large and small T antigens). Analysis of transcriptional regulation by the MH1 JC virus early promoter demonstrates that glial specificity is directed by the basal promoter. Because T antigen regulates the basal region of several viral and cellular promoters, we investigated whether it controls the JC virus basal promoter in a glial-specific manner. A JC virus T antigen expression plasmid generated a 95-kDa protein which exhibited nuclear localization and physical association with p53. T antigen repressed the JC virus and SV40 early promoters 4- to 5-fold in glioma cells. Conversely, T antigen induced 100- to 200-fold activation of the JC virus early promoter in nonglial cells, whereas the SV40 promoter was repressed. Activation required the JC virus TATA box sequence and a pentanucleotide repeat immediately upstream of the TATA box, but was independent of the upstream enhancer region.

Oligodendrocytes are the only cells in the body known to be lytically infected by JC virus, but viral early genes (i.e. large and small T antigen) are also expressed in astrocytes, which take on a bizarre, transformed appearance (1Itoyama Y.

Attempts to isolate JC virus from PML brain met with failure until it was discovered that human fetal glial cells supported lytic infection in cell culture, further suggesting the glial-specific nature of the viral infection (2Padgett B.L.

The JC virus early promoter directs higher levels of expression of a reporter gene in glial cells compared to nonglial cells (4Kenny S. Natarajan V. Strike D. Jhoury G. Salzman N.P. Science. 1984; 226: 1337-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Henson J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1046-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of the JC virus promoter region varies considerably between isolates starting immediately upstream of the viral basal promoter region, which is highly conserved (6Henson J. Saffer J. Furneaux H. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The MH1 form of the JC virus promoter contains a single basal promoter region, compared to the duplicated TATA regions in the original Mad-1 JC virus isolate, and has facilitated functional dissection of the elements involved in transcriptional regulation (Fig. 1). In a transient transfection analysis, the MH-1 JC virus early promoter activated 30- to 40-fold more transcription in glial cells than in nonglial cells. Using a sensitive luciferase assay, we found that upstream promoter elements activated expression in both glial and nonglial cells (5Henson J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1046-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results implicated the JC virus basal promoter in the regulation of glial specificity, and, therefore, we undertook a functional analysis of the basal promoter region. JC virus promoter-reporter plasmids were constructed by inserting the promoter constructs described below into the luciferase expression plasmid pA3PLUC (5Henson J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1046-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA sequence of all inserts were verified by dideoxy sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Full-length JC virus promoter (pMH1luc, Fig. 7, promoter B) was constructed using the MH-1 JC virus promoter (promoter p2, (6Henson J. Saffer J. Furneaux H. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)) and primers (JC6 5′-AGAAGCTTCACGTGACAGCT, JC26 5′-AGACTGCAGTTAGCTTTTTGCAGCAA) to amplify a region that included T antigen binding site I and the two upstream tandem repeats. pMH1(-LTaI)luc, in which T antigen binding site I was deleted by virtue of the location of a HindIII site between T antigen sites I and II, was constructed by inserting a HindIII/MscI fragment of the MH-1 JC virus promoter into pA3PLUC. pMH1(Sp1 mut)luc (Fig. 7, promoter C) contained mutations that abolish binding of Sp1 (5′-AGCGAATACCT; sequence alteration is underlined). Deletion of the tandemly repeated enhancer sequences (pMH1(-TR)luc) was performed by amplification of the promoter fragment including the GA box and T antigen binding site I (primers JC26 and JC21 5′-TCCAGTTTTAGCCAGCTC; Fig. 7, promoter D). pMH1(-Sp1)luc, which was identical with pMH1(-TR)luc except that the Sp1 site was also deleted, was similarly derived (primers JC26 and JC24 5′-ACCTTCCCTTTTTTTA; Fig. 7, promoter E). pMH1(TATA-SV)luc (Fig. 7, promoter F) and pMH1(TATA-irr)luc (Fig. 7, promoter G) contained the entire JC virus early promoter sequences of pMH1luc, but the TATA sequence was mutated either to that of SV40 (5′-TTTATTTATACA) or to an irrelevant sequence (5′-TTTAGCGTCACA) by PCR site-directed mutagenesis (7Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). A pentanucleotide mutant pMH1(-P)luc contained irrelevant DNA sequence between the GA box and the polythymidine tract (5′-CCCTCCTCATGCAGGTTTTTTTT; Fig. 7, promoter H). pSVluc was constructed by ligating a HindIII/NaeI fragment of the SV40 control region, which contained all three T antigen binding sites, into pA3PLUC. JC virus T antigen expression plasmid pJC-T was constructed by ligating a NotI-linked AciI/AvaI fragment of the early genomic region of the Mad-1 JC virus into pCR/CMV expression plasmid (Invitrogen). The orientation of the insert was confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing. SV40 T antigen expression plasmid (pSV-T; gift from Ulla Hansen, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute) contained the genomic early coding region of SV40 downstream of the RSV promoter. pCMV-p53 was a wild-type p53 expression vector (8Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K.V. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed by a standard calcium phosphate method. 0.5 × 106 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA (15 μg of promoter-luciferase plasmid, indicated amounts of T antigen expression plasmids, and pBSK (Stratagene) as a carrier). In the experiment in Fig. 1, an SV40-CAT reporter plasmid was cotransfected to allow normalization between cell lines as described (5Henson J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1046-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAT activity was determined by a standard two-phase assay. Luciferase assays were performed in duplicate as described (5Henson J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1046-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within T antigen expression experiments, luciferase values were normalized by protein concentrations as determined by a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), since T antigen regulates the promoters commonly used for internal controls (e.g. RSV promoter). All transfection assays were performed at least three times. U87MG glioma cells were plated in 6-well plates and transfected with either pJC-T or pBSK. After 48 h, the cells were fixed in ethanol for 10 min, treated with 0.3% H2O2 for 10 min, blocked in 10% horse serum in PBS for 10 min, and incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-large T antigen antibodies (PAb 416, Oncogene Science) in 2% BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Following PBS washes, cells were incubated in a 1:200 dilution of biotinylated horse anti-mouse secondary (Vector) in 2% BSA/PBS at room temperature for 1 h, washed with PBS, incubated in avidin-biotin complex (Vector) for 1 h at room temperature, and the chromogen was developed with diaminobenzidine (Sigma). For Western analysis of T antigen, equivalent amounts of 1% Nonidet P-40 or 1% Triton X-100 lysate protein were denatured in SDS buffer and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, T antigen was identified using 15 μg/ml primary antibody in 2% BSA/TBST (PAb 416 anti-large T antigen antibody, Oncogene Science) and peroxidase-labeled horse anti-mouse secondary at a dilution of 1:7,500 in 2% BSA/TBST. The peroxidase label was detected by enhanced chemiluminesence (ECL, Amersham). Immunoprecipitations were performed with 1% Nonidet P-40 cell lysates using an agarose-conjugated anti-large T antigen antibody (PAb 416, Oncogene Science). Following denaturation in SDS loading buffer, the immunoprecipitated complexes were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell). Coimmunoprecipitation of p53 was detected by incubation of the filter with 125I-labeled anti-p53 antibodies (PAb 421, Oncogene Science), followed by autoradiography (Kodak). We compared the ability of JC virus early promoter mutants to activate gene expression in U87MG glioma cells and HeLa cervical carcinoma cells in a transient transfection assay. An SV40CAT reporter plasmid was cotransfected to allow for normalization of transfection efficiency and to allow a semiquantitative comparison of expression between the two cell lines (5Henson J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1046-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows the ratio of normalized luciferase expression between U87MG and HeLa cells for each promoter construct. Wild-type JC virus early promoter pMH1luc was 34-fold stronger in glial cells than in nonglial cells. A promoter with mutations in the GA box (Sp1 binding site) was 19-fold stronger in glial cells, and a deletion mutant which contained the Sp1 binding site but lacked the upstream repeats remained 19-fold stronger in glial cells. Together with our earlier observation that the upstream tandem repeats activated gene expression in both U87MG and HeLa cells (5Henson J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1046-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this demonstrated that the basal region of the JC virus early promoter directed glial-specific expression of a reporter gene. We examined the function of the JC virus basal promoter by expressing a transcription factor that might regulate this region. The MH1 JC virus promoter has notable similarity to the SV40 promoter, which is strongly active in a wide variety of cell types and is repressed by its early gene product large T antigen (T antigen) through cooperative binding to three sites in the basal promoter (9Rio D.C. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 32: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). T antigen activates the human hsp70 promoter in a manner that is dependent upon the exact sequence of the TATA box (10Taylor I.A.C. Solomon W. Weiner B.M. Paucha P. Bradley M. Kingston R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16160-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rice P.W. Cole C.N. J. Virol. 1993; 76: 6689-6697Crossref Google Scholar), and there is in vitro evidence that T antigen physically interacts with TATA binding protein (TBP) (12Gruda M.C. Zabolotny J.M. Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it appears that T antigen regulates the basal promoters of viral and cellular genes during initiation complex formation. Because T antigen regulates various basal promoters in a divergent fashion, and because the TATA box sequences of JC virus and SV40 are different (Fig. 1), we used T antigen to investigate regulation of the glial-specific JC virus basal promoter region. The early genomic region of Mad-1 JC virus was inserted into a cytomegalovirus expression plasmid (pJC-T), and the protein product generated by transient transfection of pJC-T in U87MG glioma cells was examined. Western analysis of cell lysates from pJC-T transfected cells demonstrated a 95-kDa protein (Fig. 3A, lane 3) that migrated slightly faster than the SV40 T antigen expressed from pSV-T (lane 2), consistent with the predicted number of amino acids (JC virus = 688 amino acids; SV40 = 695 amino acids) (3Frisque R.J. Bream G.L. Canella M.T. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 458-469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mock-transfected cells contained no reactive species (lane 1). T antigen contained a functional nuclear localization signal, as shown by strong nuclear staining with anti-large T antibodies in transfected U87MG glioma cells (Fig. 3B), whereas mock-transfected cells exhibited no staining (Fig. 3C). Finally, we tested whether the pJC-T product could form a physical complex with p53. U87MG cells were cotransfected with an expression plasmid containing a human p53 cDNA and either pSV-T or pJC-T. Fig. 3D shows that p53 coimmunoprecipitated with the T antigens of both SV40 (lane 2) and JC virus (lane 3). No p53 was detected in cells transfected with p53 expression plasmid alone (lane 1). Thus, pJC-T directed expression of full-length JC virus large T antigen that was functional by criteria of nuclear localization and interaction with p53. To determine the transcriptional effect of JC virus T antigen on the JC virus early promoter, pJC-T was cotransfected with JC virus promoter-reporter plasmids into U87MG glioma cells. SV40 T antigen is known to repress its own expression by binding to three T antigen binding sites in the SV40 early promoter (9Rio D.C. Tjian R. Cell. 1983; 32: 1227-1240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The JC virus early promoter pMH1luc was repressed 5-fold by JC virus T antigen in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 also shows that JC T antigen, which has 72% amino acid identity to SV40 T antigen, repressed the SV40 promoter 5-fold. Repression was partially dependent upon the presence of binding site I, since deletion of site I in pMH1(-LTaI)luc resulted in weaker repression. Similar levels of repression were seen with transfections performed in another glioma cell line (T98G glioblastoma cells, data not shown). Three-fold stimulation of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter was seen in this assay, demonstrating that repression of the JC virus early promoter was not the result of a nonspecific reduction in gene expression. Analysis of the time course of transcriptional repression of the JC virus early promoter by T antigen (0.5 μg or 4 μg/plate at 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h following a 12-h transfection) revealed progressively stronger repression over time with maximal repression apparent between 24 and 48 h (data not shown). Although the promoter constructs contained the JC virus origin of replication, detectable plasmid DNA replication did not occur over the 48 h of the transient transfection assay as determined by Southern analysis of low molecular weight DNA extracted from the transfected cells (data not shown). Thus, transcriptional repression was not dependent on DNA replication. In conclusion, T antigen produced JC virus early promoter repression in U87MG glioma cells that was dependent upon concentration of T antigen and the presence of T antigen binding site I. The experiments in Fig. 4 demonstrated that JC virus T antigen repressed both JC virus and SV40 early promoters. To compare the function of JC virus and SV40 T antigens, we tested their regulation of the SV40 promoter in U87MG glioma cells. Fig. 5A shows that both viral T antigens produced transcriptional repression of the SV40 early promoter, and that 50% repression occurred with lower amounts of transfected pJC-T than with pSV-T. The pMH1luc JC virus promoter was repressed by both T antigens in a similar manner (data not shown). Quantitative Western analysis also suggested that JC virus T antigen was a more potent repressor than SV40 T antigen (Fig. 5B); however, since the relative affinity of the antibody for the two T antigens is not known, this conclusion remains tentative. Thus, in glial cells, JC virus and SV40 early promoters and T antigens were functionally interchangeable. We examined the possibility that repression was specific to glial cells. The SV40 promoter was repressed by T antigen in HeLa cells (Fig. 6), but T antigen produced 100- to 200-fold activation of the JC virus early promoter. A second nonglial cell line (JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells) gave similar results, although the level of activation was lower. SV40 T antigen also produced stimulation of the JC virus early promoter. There was no evidence of plasmid replication as determined by Southern analysis (data not shown). Activation was dependent upon a direct interaction between T antigen and the promoter, since pMH1(-LTaI)luc showed only slight stimulation (Fig. 6). Having found that T antigen regulated the JC virus early promoter in a cell-specific manner, we sought to define promoter elements that were required for activation in HeLa cells. Activation was independent of the tandemly repeated enhancer region, since a reporter construct containing only the proximal promoter was still activated by T antigen (Fig. 7, promoters D and E). Recent data have suggested that T antigen activates the hsp70 promoter in a TATA sequence-dependent manner (10Taylor I.A.C. Solomon W. Weiner B.M. Paucha P. Bradley M. Kingston R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16160-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rice P.W. Cole C.N. J. Virol. 1993; 76: 6689-6697Crossref Google Scholar) and that it interacts with TATA binding protein (TBP) (12Gruda M.C. Zabolotny J.M. Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Alwine J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and TBP-associated repressors (e.g. Dr1) have been implicated in TATA sequence-dependent transcriptional regulation (13Yeung K.C. Inostroza J.A. Mermelstein F.H. Kannabiran C. Reinberg D. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2097-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Kraus V.B. Inostroza J.A. Yeung K. Reinberg D. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6279-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We thus tested whether T antigen activation of the JC virus promoter was TATA-dependent. T antigen-induced repression was still seen in U87MG glioma cells following mutation of the JC virus TATA sequence to that of the SV40 promoter or to an irrelevant sequence (promoters F and G). In HeLa cells, however, T antigen failed to activate the pMH1(TATA-SV)luc promoter and the pMH1(TATA-irr)luc promoter, demonstrating that transactivation by T antigen was indeed dependent upon the sequence of a TATA box. Comparison of the MH1 and Mad-1 basal promoter sequences revealed that the two promoters are identical up through a repeated pentanucleotide sequence immediately upstream of a polythymidine tract (Fig. 1B). A previous report suggested that the pentanucleotide sequence mediates repression of the early promoter in nonglial cells, based on relatively small changes in CAT activity (15Tada H. Lashgari M. Rappaport J. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 463-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this sequence was required for T antigen-induced transactivation, the DNA sequence between the GA box and the polythymidine tract was replaced by an irrelevant sequence (Fig. 7, promoter H). T antigen was unable to stimulate a promoter containing the pentanucleotide mutation. However, this mutation did not increase the level of transcription in HeLa cells. Mutation of the GA box, which is immediately upstream of the pentanucleotide sequences, did not abolish the ability of T antigen to transactivate, demonstrating specificity for the pentanucleotide and TATA box sequences (Fig. 7, promoter C). Once a rare condition, PML is no longer infrequent since approximately 5% of patients with AIDS develop this fatal brain disease (16Bacellar H. Munoz A. Miller E.N. Cohen B.A. Besley D. Selnes O.A. Becker J.T. McArthur J.C. Neurology. 1994; 44: 1892-1900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The unique feature of PML is the selective destruction of oligodendrocytes by JC virus and selective expression of viral genes in astrocytes. Although it is likely that this cell-type specificity is regulated at more than one point in the viral life cycle, the best understood of these points is the glial-specific activation of early viral gene expression. Based upon features of transcriptional enhancers, it seemed likely that glial specificity would be mediated by the tandemly repeated elements. However, our data have demonstrated that the MH1 JC virus basal promoter region also has a role in this specificity. We therefore examined the role of T antigen, which regulates the basal promoter, in JC virus early promoter regulation. We detected a divergent, cell-type-specific response to T antigen, and we found that these responses were mediated by sequences in the basal promoter. Whereas JC virus T antigen induced repression of the JC virus early promoter in glial cells, a different phenomena was observed in HeLa cells, where the JC virus early promoter was strongly stimulated. Activation was dependent upon the sequence of the TATA box. The function of the TATA mutant JC virus promoter in glial cells in the absence of T antigen was not altered, demonstrating that the loss of activation in HeLa cells was not due to a nonspecific loss of promoter activity. Alterations in TATA sequences have been shown to exert specific effects on function of promoters. For instance, the sequence 5′-TATAA in the hsp70 promoter was crucial for activation by T antigen and the adenovirus protein E1A (11Rice P.W. Cole C.N. J. Virol. 1993; 76: 6689-6697Crossref Google Scholar, 17Simon M.C. Fisch T.M. Benecke B.J. Nevins J.R. Heintz N. Cell. 1988; 52: 723-729Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Gillinger G. Alwine J.C. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6682-6688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of this sequence with the SV40 TATA sequence 5′-TATTTAT abolished E1A-induced activation but maintained heat inducibility, whereas mutation to an irrelevant sequence resulted in loss of both E1A and heat inducibility. Upstream elements were not required for activation by T antigen. Tissue-specific expression from the myoglobin gene promoter required a specific TATA box sequence in concert with a muscle-specific enhancer element (19Wefald F.C. Devlin B.H. Williams R.S. Nature. 1990; 344: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The recent identification of TATA-associated factors and the observation that T antigen binds to TBP suggest that specificity directed by the basal promoter may be achieved through the proteins that interact directly with TBP (20Chen J.L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Mutation of the pentanucleotide sequence adjacent to the TATA box also abolished activation by T antigen. The pentanucleotide sequence is of particular interest because it is the most upstream sequence shared by MH1 and Mad-1 promoters. Others have reported the presence of a possible repressor site in the JC virus Mad-1 promoter. Early gene expression in JC virus-transformed hamster glial cells was abolished following fusion of the glial cells with mouse fibroblasts, consistent with the presence of a protein in the nonglial cells that repressed the JC virus early promoter (21Beggs A.H. Frisque R.J. Scangos G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7632-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Further evidence for a specific repressor site in the JC virus early promoter came from studies in which an oligonucleotide, containing sequences which overlapped the viral TATA box, was introduced upstream of the SV40 basal promoter and was found to stimulate reporter gene expression in glial cells (U87MG glioma), but repress expression in mouse fibroblasts (15Tada H. Lashgari M. Rappaport J. Khalili K. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 463-466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis was performed using a heterologous promoter construct, and the changes in CAT activity were very small, making interpretation of the data difficult. Our pentanucleotide mutant did not exhibit increased transcriptional activity in HeLa cells, possibly because of the extent of the mutation. Specific nuclear proteins bind to the pentanucleotide repeats in the basal promoter (22Sharma A.K. Kumar G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 23Kumar G. Srivastava D.K. Tefera W. Virology. 1994; 203: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These experiments have employed a combination of gel mobility shift assays and UV cross-linking of the protein to DNA to demonstrate the binding of an approximately 50-60-kDa protein present in glial and HeLa cells. The nature of this protein remains unknown. Although there are several potential mechanisms for these results, they are most easily explained by the presence of a TBP-associated repressor that binds to the basal JC virus promoter and that is displaced by T antigen. A model for such a mechanism can be found with the adenoviral protein E1A, which appears to activate the hsp70 promoter in a TATA sequence specific manner by dissociating a 19-kDa repressor, Dr1, from TBP (14Kraus V.B. Inostroza J.A. Yeung K. Reinberg D. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6279-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that the glial specificity of the JC virus early promoter is regulated by a repressor acting on the basal promoter in nonglial cells is attractive because it explains a number of experimental observations: it explains why the basal promoter is invariant, but the upstream enhancer areas vary between isolates (6Henson J. Saffer J. Furneaux H. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and why extensive searches have failed to reveal a clearly glial-specific element in the upstream promoter region. Finally, it would also explain our recent studies showing that the upstream enhancer regions activate the basal promoter in glial and nonglial cells (5Henson J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1046-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together with experiments demonstrating that the glial-specific transcription factor Oct-6 regulates the JC virus basal promoter (24Renner K. Leger H. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6433-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the mechanism of glial specificity resides in basal elements instead of the enhancer region."

The novel “prohormone thiol protease” (PTP) has been proposed as a candidate proenkephalin processing enzyme for the production of [Met]enkephalin in chromaffin granules (Krieger, T. J., and Hook, V. Y. H.(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 88376-8383). In this study, PTP was examined during elevation of cellular [Met]enkephalin by forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase that produces cAMP. Treatment of chromaffin cells with forskolin for 72 h increased enkephalin precursor cleaving activity (measured by following the conversion of the model substrate [35S-Met]preproenkephalin to trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity) in isolated chromaffin granules by 170-180% over controls (100%). The increased activity was associated with the membrane fraction, rather than the soluble fraction, of chromaffin granules. The elevated activity was inhibited by E-64c, which is a potent inhibitor of PTP and cysteine proteases; however, the activity was not inhibited by serine or aspartic protease inhibitors. The elevated activity was identified as PTP based on immunoprecipitation by anti-PTP immunoglobulins. Stimulation of PTP synthesis was involved in the forskolin-induced increase in PTP activity, as demonstrated by a 10-fold increase in [35S]PTP pulse labeling in forskolin-treated chromaffin cells. Forskolin elevation of PTP protein levels within chromaffin granules was also detected in Western blots. Importantly, the forskolin-mediated rise in cellular [Met]enkephalin levels was completely blocked when cells were preincubated with the cysteine protease inhibitor Ep453, which is known to be converted by intracellular esterases to the more effective inhibitor E-64c (Buttle, D. J., Saklatvala, J., Tamai, M., and Barrett, A. J.(1992) Biochem. J. 281, 175-177). Both E-64c and Ep453 inhibit PTP, with E-64c being more potent (Azaryan, A. V., and Hook, V. Y. H. (1994b) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 314, 171-177). These results demonstrate a role for PTP in proenkephalin processing in chromaffin cells and indicate that [Met]enkephalin formation and PTP are both regulated by cAMP.

https://openalex.org/W1977801317,"Collagen IV is the major component of basement membranes. The human α3 chain of collagen IV contains an antigenic domain called the Goodpasture antigen that is the target for the circulating immunopathogenic antibodies present in patients with Goodpasture syndrome. Characteristically, the gene region encoding the Goodpasture antigen generates multiple alternative products that retain the antigen amino-terminal region with a five-residue motif (KRGDS). The serine therein appears to be the major in vitro cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site in the isolated antigen and can be phosphorylated in vitro by two protein kinases of approximately 50 and 41 kDa associated with human kidney plasma membrane, suggesting that it can also be phosphorylated in vivo. Consistent with this, the Goodpasture antigen is isolated from human kidney in phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms and only the non-phosphorylated form is susceptible to phosphorylation in vitro.

The oligonucleotides used in the PCR amplifications were ON-BHNC1c and either 1) ON-HNC5 m, to produce rGP; 2) ON-HNC9 m, to produce a deleted antigen lacking the first 26 amino acids (−26rGP); or 3) ONGP-Ser, to produce a mutant substituting Ala for Ser9 (rGPAla9). To produce the other alanine-for-serine mutants (rGPAla26 and rGPAla9,26), two separate PCR products with overlapping sequence were combined following the protocol described in Higuchi, 1990Higuchi R. Inis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 177-183Google Scholar. The oligonucleotide pairs used were ONGP-Ser2 m/ONBNC1c and ONHNC5 m/ONGP-Ser1c (rGPAla26) or ONGP-Ser/ONGP-Ser1c (rGPAla9,26). Initial clonings were established in Escherichia coli HB101, and the cDNA of each plasmid of interest was further confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. For protein expression, the plasmids were transferred to E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and the individual clones were induced following the supplier's instructions. After disrupting the cells by sonication, recombinant proteins were purified by repeated precipitations. The α3(IV)NC1 monomers were prepared from NC1 of collagen IV as in Hellmark et al., 1994Hellmark T. Johansson C. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar. The HPLC fractions containing only α3(IV)NC1 material were pooled and dried. This material was resuspended in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 (GPs fraction). The unsolubilized material was recovered with 8 M urea in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5 (GPp fraction). Unless indicated, phosphorylation studies were done with GPp fractions by diluting the antigen sample at least 100 times in phosphorylation buffer. Unless indicated, synthetic peptides (1 mg/ml) were incubated at 30°C as described (Guasch et al., 1986Guasch M.D. Plana M. Vila J. Itarte E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 250: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar; Walker and Sando, 1988Walker J.M. Sando J.J. J. Biol.

The reactions were terminated by spotting an aliquot on Whatman P81 paper followed by washing in 75 mM H3PO4 and assay of the radioactivity. Km values were estimated using the Enzfitter adjusting program (Leatherbarrow, 1987Leatherbarrow R.J. Enzfitter: A Nonlinear Regression Data Analysis Program for the IBM PC. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1987Google Scholar). Recombinant antigens (22 μg/ml) were similarly phosphorylated with 9 units of PKA catalytic subunit (Promega) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP during 15 min in a total volume of 30 μl. Native antigens (15-25 ng) were phosphorylated in 40 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mM MgCl2, 150 μM ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 25 units of PKA catalytic subunit (Promega) during 8-16 h in a total volume of 50 μl. GPpep1 was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and the PKA catalytic subunit. After 6 h, the reactions were terminated by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a concentration of 0.5% and injected into a μBondapack™ C18 HPLC column (3.9 × 300 mm from Waters). The bound material was eluted with a 30-min gradient of 0-60% acetonitrile in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The absorbance of the effluent was monitored continuously at 214 nm, 1-min fractions were collected, and Cerenkov radiation was determined. Both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GPpep1 eluted as a single peak at 22 min. The HPLC fractions containing the phosphorylated peptide were combined, dried, dissolved in 6 M HCl, and incubated 1 h at 110°C. The HCl was then removed by evaporation in a rotavapor and the residue was redissolved in water. After addition of carrier unlabeled phosphoamino acids, the solution was subjected to electrophoresis (1000 V for 1 h) in cellulose thin layer plates using a buffer of pyridine:acetic acid:water, 5:50:945, pH 3.5. Amino acids were revealed with ninhydrin, and the radioactivity was detected autoradiographically. Human kidney plasma membranes were prepared essentially as described in Von der Mark and Risse, 1987Von der Mark K. Risse G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 491-507Google Scholar. After saccharose gradient, the interphase 17-40% containing the plasma membranes were collected and stored at −20°C until needed. Where indicated, partially purified membrane fractions and soluble material were used for renaturation assays. Renaturation and assay of protein kinases after SDS-PAGE was performed essentially as in Hutchcroft et al., 1991Hutchcroft J.E. Anostario Jr., M. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L.

To perform renaturation assays of protein kinases on Western blots, purified PKA catalytic subunit and plasma membrane were analyzed in SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) in the absence of methanol. The membrane was washed five times with 10 ml of 40 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, during 10 min. Fragments of membrane containing the protein kinases of interest were excised and independently incubated at room temperature with 100 μl of the corresponding protein substrate (50 μg/ml in Hepes buffer). After 10 min, 100 μl of the same buffer containing 20 mM MnCl2 and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h 30°C in a water bath. Mn2+ has been shown to be much more effective than Mg2+-supporting PKA catalytic subunit action in renaturation studies at low ATP concentrations (Geahlen et al., 1986Geahlen R.L. Anostario Jr., M. Low P.S. Harrison M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 153: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Subsequently, soluble material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE prior or after digestion and immunoprecipitation as indicated below. When assaying GPpep1, the individual membranes were blocked (3% bovine serum albumin in Hepes buffer for 10 min) and extensively washed (Hepes buffer) prior to the addition of 200 μl of phosphorylation mixture containing 20 nmol of GPpep1. When indicated, the phosphorylation mixture was reduced and digested in 50 mM NH4 acetate, pH 4, 10 mM dithiothreitol using 0.5 μg of V8 proteinase. After 14 h at 37°C, the mixture was neutralized with 1 M Tris, pH 8.8, 10 mM dithiothreitol was added to maintain reducing conditions, and the digested material was alkylated for 1 h on ice with 20 mMN-ethylmaleimide. The mixture was brought to oxidizing conditions with 1 μl of 33% H2O2 and heated 15 min at 75°C. This material was diluted 10-20 times with 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8, and incubated with 50 μl of pre-immunized control serum for 1 h at room temperature. The control antibodies were removed using protein A-Sepharose. Subsequently, the precleared supernatant was similarly extracted with the same amount of specific antisera (anti-GPpep1 or anti-GPpep1/bov). The protein A precipitates containing the materials of interest were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. All the constructs to be expressed were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

SDS-PAGE, protein transference onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), and immunochemical techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting) were performed essentially as described (Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206961) Google Scholar; Burnette, 1981Burnette N.

Where indicated NH2-terminal sequence was determined using an Applied Biosystems gas-phase protein sequencer model 470A by the Servei de Sequenciació, Universitat de Barcelona. A 21-mer peptide, GPpep1 (KGKRGDSGSPATWTTRGFVFT), representing residues 3-23 of the Goodpasture antigen2 was assayed for its potential to be phosphorylated. Among the several protein kinases tested, only the catalytic subunit of PKA significantly phosphorylated this peptide (Table I).Table IPhosphorylation of Goodpasture peptides by several protein kinases When the phosphorylation of GPpep1 by the PKA holoenzyme was assayed, a total dependence on cAMP was observed. The presence in the assay of the protein inhibitor specific for this kinase inhibited 80% of its activity on GPpep1, a similar value to that obtained with histone type IIA (data not shown). The apparent Km (Michaelis-Menten constant) value for GPpep1 phosphorylation was 0.68 mM, a value similar to the Km values found for other peptide substrates of PKA (Kemp et al., 1977Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Zetterqvist and Ragnarsson, 1982Zetterqvist O. Ragnarsson U. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To further characterize the phosphorylation of GPpep1 by PKA, the reaction mixture was applied to an HPLC μBondapack™ C18 column and eluted as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1A, the major absorbance and radioactive peaks were coincident and eluted at 22 min. Fractions corresponding to this peak were used then for phosphoamino acid and amino-terminal sequence analysis (Fig. 1, B and C, respectively). From these data we conclude that GPpep1 is phosphorylatable by PKA at serine residues. Of the two serines in GPpep1, KGKRGDS9GS11PATWTTRGFVFT, that at position 9 within the Goodpasture antigen conforming to the consensus motif for PKA recognition (K-R-X-X-S) (Kemp and Pearson, 1990Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar) appears to be the most likely point of phosphorylation. In fact, GPpep3 (KGKRGDS9G) a shorter peptide containing only this serine was also phosphorylatable, and a GPpep1 variant in which Ser9 was replaced by Ala did not incorporated significant amount of 32P in the same assay conditions (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the Goodpasture antigen is phosphorylatable at Ser9 by PKA in the region where maximum differences exist between the different NC1 domains of collagen IV chains. However, the phosphorylation of GPpep1 does not imply that similar phosphorylation could occur in the full antigen. To test this, we produced in a bacterial expression system recombinant Goodpasture antigen (rGP) and derived mutants in which one or both of the two serines at the amino side conforming to a PKA phosphorylation consensus site (GLKGKRGDS9GSPATWTTRGFVFTRHS26) are replaced by alanines (rGP-Ala9, rGP-Ala26, and rGP-Ala9,26) or the 26 amino-terminal residues containing both serines are removed (−26rGP). In A of Fig. 2, we present the autoradiographic analysis of the PKA-phosphorylated recombinant proteins. The phosphorylation observed in rGP (lane 1) was dramatically decreased in the mutants where both serines were removed (lane 2) or replaced (lane 5). As expected, the substitution of either serine resulted in reduced 32P incorporation (lanes 3 and 4). However, the substitution of Ser26 (lane 4) inhibited the incorporation of 32P to the recombinant antigen to a greater extent, indicating that this is the preferred phosphorylation site in the recombinant antigen. To further assess the region involved in the 32P incorporation, we isolated and similarly analyzed the corresponding amino-terminal regions of the phosphorylated proteins. To achieve this, we specifically immunoprecipitated these regions after digestion with V8 proteinase that specifically cuts the antigen after Glu36. The autoradiographic patterns obtained (B) were consistent with those of the full antigens, indicating that both Ser are phosphorylatable by PKA and that they are the major phosphorylation sites in rGP. The residual 32P incorporation in rGP-Ala9,26 and in −26rGP (A, lanes 2 and 5) could be attributed to an additional PKA phosphorylation site located more toward the carboxyl end (Ser185) and, therefore, not present in the immunoprecipitated material (B, lanes 2 and 5). From these data we conclude that the bacterial recombinant form of the Goodpasture antigen is phosphorylatable by PKA and that Ser9 and Ser26 in its amino-terminal region are the major phosphorylation sites. Because the native structure of the Goodpasture antigen is maintained by cystines and the recombinant material was produced in the reducing environment of bacteria, the rGP did not display native folding (Penadés et al., 1995Penadés J.R. Bernal D. Revert F. Johansson C. Fresquet V.J. Cervera J. Wieslander J. Quinones S. Saus J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to investigate if the native antigen would also be similarly phosphorylated. In Fig. 3 we show that the native Goodpasture antigen is phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA (A, lane 1) and that its amino-terminal region contains major phosphorylation sites (B, lane 1), resembling the phosphorylation of the recombinant antigen. However the nonavailability of mutants from natural source with specific serine substitution makes it impossible to determine the contribution of each individual serine to the phosphorylation event. Nevertheless, because 1) the bovine and human antigens have a 90% sequence identity with divergencies concentrated at the amino-terminal region, including Ser9 (Thr in bovine sequence); and 2) Ser26, Ser185, and the corresponding flanking regions remain conserved (Turner et al., 1992Turner N. Mason P.J. Brown R. Fox M. Povey S. Rees A. Pusey C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 592-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar; Quinones et al., 1992Quinones S. Bernal D. Garca-Sogo M. Elena S.F. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19780-19784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine antigen appears to be an excellent “native human mutant” where Ser9 has been substituted by Thr. Therefore, we carried out phosphorylation studies using bovine antigen in order to assess the role of Ser9 in the in vitro phosphorylation of the native antigen structure by the catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig. 3). Interestingly, we could not detect incorporation of 32P in the bovine antigen (A, lane 2) nor in its amino-terminal region (B, lane 2) in the same assay conditions in which human antigen displayed notable phosphorylation (A and B, lane 1). The absence of 32P incorporation in the bovine antigen suggests that the sequences conforming the consensus sites therein (Ser26 and Ser185) are either not easily accessible in the native structure or that they are fully phosphorylated in vivo. However, the latter explanation appears to be unlikely because no phosphoserine is detectable in the isolated bovine antigen (see below). From these comparative studies, it is firmly established that the isolated native Goodpasture antigen is phosphorylatable in vitro by PKA within its amino-terminal region, and it is strongly suggested that Ser9 is the preferred phosphorylation site. To approach the physiological relevance of the phosphorylation of the Goodpasture antigen, we investigated the content of phosphoserine of native Goodpasture antigen in comparison with the recombinant and bovine counterparts. Similar amounts of native (GP) or recombinant antigen (rGP) were analyzed and blotted with monoclonal antibodies against the amino-terminal region of the Goodpasture antigen (M3/1) or with monoclonal antibodies against phosphoserine (PSer) (Fig. 4A). A significant content of phosphoserine was detected in the native antigen, whereas no reactivity was observed in the bacterial recombinant form under the same assay conditions. The PSer reactivity of native antigen was partially inhibited when phosphoserine was added to the blotting antibodies but not when the phosphoamino acid added was phosphotyrosine (data not shown). From these data we conclude that the Goodpasture antigen is phosphorylated in vivo at serines. Because the presence or absence of Ser9 appears to be a major contributor to the difference between human and bovine antigens in their in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 3), it was of interest to investigate if differences could also be found in endogenous phosphoserine content. In B of Fig. 4, similar amounts of human (GP) or bovine (GPb) antigens were analyzed and blotted with polyclonal antibodies that similarly react with both antigens (aM2/M2) or with anti-phosphoserine monoclonal antibodies (PSer). Interestingly, bovine material displayed no notable PSer reactivity in comparison with that detected in the human antigen sample. The similarity between the in vitro phosphorylation (Fig. 3) and the phosphoserine contents (Fig. 4) of the native antigens suggests that Ser9 could be the major in vivo serine phosphorylation site in the Goodpasture antigen. If this is the case then the in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of human antigen must be inversely related, because only serines not phosphorylated in vivo can incorporate 32P in the in vitro assays. We have separated two human antigen fractions based on their distinct ability to go into aqueous solutions after HPLC purification (see “Experimental Procedures”). The antigen fraction that was soluble in nondenaturing buffers (GPs) showed higher content in phosphoserine when compared with the fraction that required 8 M urea to go into solution (GPp; Fig. 5A). When these fractions were separately phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA, the in vivo highly phosphorylated antigen (GPs) displayed less ability to incorporate 32P than the GPp fraction (Fig. 5B). In one sample preparation, the GPp fraction obtained did not contain any detectable phosphoserine and was a much better substrate for in vitro phosphorylation studies. In this case, the GPs fraction displayed more elevated PSer reactivity and did not incorporate detectable 32P in presence of PKA catalytic subunit (data not shown). All these data indicate that Goodpasture antigen can be isolated in phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms and strongly suggest that Ser9 is the major in vivo phosphorylation site in the Goodpasture antigen and that PKA or a catalytically related protein kinase is the in vivo phosphorylating enzyme. To further study the significance of the above phenomenon, we isolated plasma membrane from human kidney and assayed renatured protein kinases after SDS-PAGE or Western blot analysis. In the upper panels of Fig. 6, the catalytic subunit of bovine PKA (lanes 1) or plasma membrane from human kidney (lanes 2) were analyzed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels polymerized in the absence or presence of different PKA protein substrates. After electrophoresis and renaturation, the presence of in situ phosphorylation, as a conse"

Moreover, primed cells seemed to adhere best to laminin. The binding site in laminin, mediating cell attachment, was identified as containing the YIGSR sequence, a known cell binding motif, located in the short arm of the B1 chain of laminin. The synthetic peptide amide, C(YIGSR)3-NH2, containing a repeat of this binding motif, inhibited the attachment of neuroblastoma cells to laminin in a competitive manner, and its inhibitory activity was inversely dependent on laminin concentrations. Affinity chromatography of membrane-extracted proteins over an Affi-Gel 10 column conjugated to C(YIGSR)3-NH2, revealed a major YIGSR-binding protein with an apparent molecular mass of 67 kDa. The 67-kDa surface membrane protein was specifically eluted from the column with the soluble C(YIGSR)3-NH2 peptide, but not with an unrelated peptide. Furthermore, no 67-kDa laminin-binding protein was recovered from an unrelated peptide matrix with the free C(YIGSR)3-NH2 peptide. Ligand blot overlay assays with biotin-labeled C(YIGSR)3-NH2 peptide demonstrated that the 67-kDa receptor is indeed a YIGSR-binding protein. This 67-kDa laminin-binding protein appeared to be down-regulated upon differentiation of LA-N1 cells, as indicated by the level of this protein and its mRNA."

Like thrombin, concanavalin A stimulated a time-dependent accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P<sup>2</sup>, which reached maximal levels after 5 min of stimulation. However, while synthesis of PtdIns(3,4)P<sup>2</sup> induced by thrombin was dependent on platelet aggregation, the production of PtdIns(3,4)P<sup>2</sup> induced by concanavalin A was unchanged when aggregation was prevented by the omission of stirring or when fibrinogen binding to platelets was inhibited by the tetrapeptide RGDS. Accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P<sup>2</sup> was not observed in platelets stimulated with succinyl-concanavalin A, a dimeric derivative of the lectin that binds to the same receptors on the platelet surface but does not promote clustering of membrane glycoproteins. The synthesis of PtdIns(3,4)P<sup>2</sup> induced by concanavalin A was also independent of the membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, as normal accumulation of this lipid was observed in platelets from two patients affected by Glanzmann thrombasthenia. In contrast, thrombin showed a strongly reduced ability to stimulate PtdIns(3,4)P<sup>2</sup> production in thrombasthenic platelets. Although concanavalin A was able to induce association of the regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG-213 did not inhibit the lectin-induced synthesis of PtdIns(3,4)P<sup>2</sup>. These results demonstrate the existence of a novel mechanism of PtdIns(3,4)P<sup>2</sup> synthesis in human platelets, which is independent of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa and aggregation, but requires clustering of membrane glycoproteins. As clustering events occur during platelet aggregation promoted by physiological agonists, this new mechanism may also be involved in the aggregation-dependent production of PtdIns(3,4)P<sup>2</sup> in thrombin-stimulated platelets."
