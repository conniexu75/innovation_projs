These basic observations on cancer cell metabolism have opened multiple new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues in cancer research. Recent studies demonstrated that smoking could induce the expression of xCT (SLC7A11) in oral cancer cells, suggesting that overexpression of xCT may support lung tumor progression. We hypothesized that overexpression of xCT occurs in lung cancer cells to satisfy the metabolic requirements for growth and survival. Our results demonstrated that 1) xCT was highly expressed at the cytoplasmic membrane in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 2) the expression of xCT was correlated with advanced stage and predicted a worse 5-year survival, 3) targeting xCT transport activity in xCT overexpressing NSCLC cells with sulfasalazine decreased cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and in vivo and 4) increased dependence on glutamine was observed in xCT overexpressed normal airway epithelial cells. These results suggested that xCT regulate metabolic requirements during lung cancer progression and be a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2803663267,"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological cancer, where survival rates have had modest improvement over the last 30 years. Metastasis of cancer cells is a major clinical problem, and patient mortality occurs when ovarian cancer cells spread beyond the confinement of ovaries. Disseminated ovarian cancer cells typically spread within the abdomen, where ascites accumulation aids in their transit. Metastatic ascites contain multicellular spheroids, which promote chemo-resistance and recurrence. However, little is known about the origin and mechanisms through which spheroids arise. Using live-imaging of 3D culture models and animal models, we report that epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells, the most common type of ovarian cancer, can spontaneously detach as either single cells or clusters. We report that clusters are more resistant to anoikis and have a potent survival advantage over single cells. Using in vivo lineage tracing, we found that multicellular spheroids arise preferentially from collective detachment, rather than aggregation in the abdomen. Finally, we report that multicellular spheroids from collective detachment are capable of seeding intra-abdominal metastases that retain intra-tumoral heterogeneity from the primary tumor."

https://openalex.org/W2804167320,"Bacillus cereus is the 2nd most frequent bacterial agent responsible for food-borne outbreaks in France and the 3rd in Europe. In addition, local and systemic infections have been reported, mainly describing individual cases or single hospital setting. The real incidence of such infection is unknown and information on genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the incriminated strains is generally scarce. We performed an extensive study of B. cereus strains isolated from patients and hospital environments from nine hospitals during a 5-year study, giving an overview of the consequences, sources and pathogenic patterns of B. cereus clinical infections. We demonstrated the occurrence of several hospital-cross-contaminations. Identical B. cereus strains were recovered from different patients and hospital environments for up to 2 years. We also clearly revealed the occurrence of inter hospital contaminations by the same strain. These cases represent the first documented events of nosocomial epidemy by B. cereus responsible for intra and inter hospitals contaminations. Indeed, contamination of different patients with the same strain of B. cereus was so far never shown. In addition, we propose a scheme for the characterization of B. cereus based on biochemical properties and genetic identification and highlight that main genetic signatures may carry a high pathogenic potential. Moreover, the characterization of antibiotic resistance shows an acquired resistance phenotype for rifampicin. This may provide indication to adjust the antibiotic treatment and care of patients."

They are both present in the blood, but their respective biological activities are still a matter of debate. The aim of the present work was to characterize their circulating forms to better understand how their activities are regulated in vivo. First, by cotransfecting BMP9 and BMP10, we found that both can form a disulfide-bonded heterodimer in vitro and that this heterodimer is functional on endothelial cells via ALK1. Next, we developed an ELISA that could specifically recognize the BMP9–BMP10 heterodimer and which indicated its presence in both human and mouse plasma. In addition to using available Bmp9-KO mice, we generated a conditional Bmp10-KO mouse strain. The plasma from Bmp10-KO mice, similarly to that of Bmp9-KO mice, completely lacked the ability to activate ALK1-transfected 3T3 cells or phospho-Smad1–5 on endothelial cells, indicating that the circulating BMP activity is mostly due to the BMP9–BMP10 heterodimeric form. This result was confirmed in human plasma that had undergone affinity chromatography to remove BMP9 homodimer. Finally, we provide evidence that hepatic stellate cells in the liver could be the source of the BMP9–BMP10 heterodimer. Together, our findings demonstrate that BMP9 and BMP10 can heterodimerize and that this heterodimer is responsible for most of the biological BMP activity found in plasma.

A single disulfide bond within the terminal mature region allows dimerization of the pro-protein, which is further processed through proteolytic cleavage by furin proconvertases (3.Constam D.B.

BMP homodimers bind to and activate a receptor complex consisting of two type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases (5.Miyazono K. Kamiya Y. Morikawa M.

Following ligand binding, activated receptors propagate signaling by phosphorylating the receptor-regulated SMAD1, -5, or -8, which, in association with SMAD4, translocate to the cell nucleus and regulate expression of the SMAD pathway-responsive genes (6.Garcia de Vinuesa A. Abdelilah-Seyfried S. Knaus P. Zwijsen A. Bailly S. BMP signaling in vascular biology and dysfunction.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2016; 27 (26823333): 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Among the TGFβ growth factor family, BMP9 and BMP10 are two high-affinity ligands for the endothelial-specific type I receptor activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) and its co-receptor endoglin (7.David L. Mallet C. Mazerbourg S. Feige J.J. Bailly S.

Indeed, mutations in ACVLR1, encoding ALK1, or ENG, encoding endoglin, cause an autosomal dominant disease, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), characterized by vascular disorders including abundant epistaxis, dilated blood vessels, and arteriovenous malformations (9.Johnson D.W.

Accordingly, in mice, inactivation of Acvlr1 is lethal at mid-gestation due to severe vascular defects (10.Oh S.P. Seki T. Goss K.A. Imamura T. Yi Y. Donahoe P.K. Li L. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P.

BMP9 is mainly produced by the liver (12.Bidart M. Ricard N. Levet S. Samson M. Mallet C. David L. Subileau M. Tillet E. Feige J.J. Bailly S.

Rosen V. Thies R.S. Heart specific expression of mouse BMP-10 a novel member of the TGF-β superfamily.Mech.

Bmp10 deletion was first shown to lead to embryonic lethality due to cardiac defects (14.Chen H. Shi S. Acosta L. Li W. Lu J. Bao S. Chen Z. Yang Z. Schneider M.D. Chien K.R. Conway S.J. Yoder M.C.

However, more recently, it was also shown that loss of Bmp10 could also lead to vascular defects both in mouse and zebrafish (15.Chen H. Brady Ridgway J. Sai T. Lai J. Warming S. Chen H.

On the other hand, Bmp9 knockout (KO) mice are viable, but presented lymphatic defects (17.Levet S. Ciais D. Merdzhanova G. Mallet C. Zimmers T.A. Lee S.J. Navarro F.P. Texier I. Feige J.J. Bailly S.

Interestingly, it was also found that BMP9 and BMP10 could compensate for each other's loss and that BMP9 and BMP10 play a redundant role in postnatal vascular development (15.Chen H.

However, there is still a debate about the latency of BMP10. First, it has been shown that, when bound to its prodomain, mature BMP10 is inactive (22.Sengle G. Ono R.N. Sasaki T. Sakai L.Y. Prodomains of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily members specify different functions: extracellular matrix interactions and growth factor bioavailability.J. Biol.

Zhu J. Wang R. Chen X. Mi L. Walz T. Springer T.A.

Pappano W.N. Davies M.V. Song K. Tomkinson K.N. Wright J.F. Zhao L. Sebald S.M. Greenspan D.S. Lee S.J. Activation of latent myostatin by the BMP-1/tolloid family of metalloproteinases.Proc. Natl.

A more recent report indicates, however, that recombinant human BMP10 is fully active on endothelial cells, albeit it forms a very stable complex of the mature form associated with the prodomain (25.Jiang H. Salmon R.M. Upton P.D. Wei Z. Lawera A. Davenport A.P. Morrell N.W. Li W. The prodomain-bound form of bone morphogenetic protein 10 is biologically active on endothelial cells.J. Biol.

Lai J. Warming S. Chen H. Roose-Girma M. Zhang G. Shou W. Yan M. Context-dependent signaling defines roles of BMP9 and BMP10 in embryonic and postnatal development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23812757): 11887-1189210.1073/pnas.1306074110Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that anti-BMP10 antibodies could partially decrease Smad6 gene induction by mouse serum, indicating that active BMP10 is present in blood. These data thus appear in contradiction with the absence of ALK1-stimulating activity measured in Bmp9-KO mouse plasma (19.Ricard N. Ciais D. Levet S. Subileau M. Mallet C. Zimmers T.A. Lee S.J. Bidart M. Feige J.J. Bailly S. BMP9 and BMP10 are critical for postnatal retinal vascular remodeling.Blood. 2012; 119 (22566602): 6162-617110.1182/blood-2012-01-407593Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). One hypothesis that could reconcile these results is that plasmatic ALK1 ligand is a BMP9–10 heterodimer rather than a mixture of homodimeric BMP9 and BMP10. Indeed, although most BMPs have been described as homodimeric proteins, they can also, to some extent, heterodimerize (1.Zinski J. Tajer B. Mullins M.C. TGF-β family signaling in early vertebrate development.Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Biol. 2017; 2017 (28600394)1101/cshperspect.a033274Google Scholar). Such heterodimers spark increasing interest because they likely provide a distinct signaling pattern (26.Guo J. Wu G. The signaling and functions of heterodimeric bone morphogenetic proteins.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2012; 23 (22421241): 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The aim of the present work was to better characterize the circulating forms of BMP9 and BMP10 and to evaluate whether BMP9 and BMP10 can form a heterodimer. We provide evidence that, when co-expressed, BMP9 and BMP10 can associate to form a disulfide-bonded BMP9–10 heterodimer. More importantly, we identified the presence of BMP9–10 heterodimers in human and mouse plasma and show that this heterodimer is active and represents the major circulating form in blood. To evaluate whether BMP9–10 heterodimerization can occur, we first transfected HEK-293 cells with both BMP9 and BMP10 cDNAs. First, we engineered recombinant BMP9 and BMP10 and added two different tags placed between the prodomain and the mature BMP peptide, i.e. downstream of the furin-cleavage site (Fig. 1A). BMP9 was tagged with a 6-histidine motif, whereas BMP10 was tagged with a myc epitope. Tagged BMP9 and BMP10 were transfected into HEK-293 cells, either solely or together and secreted BMPs were evaluated by Western blotting of conditioned media (CM) (Fig. 1B). Both BMPs were produced as incompletely processed molecules, as 3 bands around 110 kDa (unprocessed dimeric pro-BMP), 50–65 kDa (monomer or partially processed BMP), and 23 kDa (mature dimeric peptide) were revealed by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). To determine whether heterodimeric BMP9–10 could be produced by double-transfected cells, we affinity-purified the two BMPs using their specific tags. For this, CM from His-BMP9/myc-BMP10 co-transfected cells was applied onto a HisTrapTM column and bound BMPs were then eluted and evaluated by Western blotting. As expected, His-BMP9 was fully retained by the HisTrapTM column and only detected in the 200 mmol/liter of imidazole elution (Fig. 1C). Myc-BMP10 was partially detected in the unbound or weakly bound fractions (flow-through (FT), wash) but could also be observed in the elution fraction, demonstrating that BMP9 and BMP10 interacted when they were co-transfected (Fig. 1C). We then analyzed whether BMP9 and BMP10 could still interact under denaturing conditions. Under this condition, heterodimeric disulfide-bonded molecules should still co-elute, whereas oligomeric noncovalent BMP9–BMP10 complexes should be disrupted by denaturation. For this, CM was treated with 8 mol/liter of urea and heated for 20 min at 65 °C before being applied to the HisTrapTM column. We observed that myc-BMP10 could still interact with His-BMP9 (Fig. 1D). On the contrary, further treatment resulting in reduction and alkylation of disulfide-bonds completely disrupted myc-BMP10 binding, as shown by the absence of signal in the eluate using an anti-myc antibody detection, albeit BMP9 was still detectable (Fig. 1E). As a control, loading of the HisTrapTM column with single-transfected myc-BMP10 CM demonstrated the absence of nonspecific binding of myc-BMP10 alone (Fig. S1). To further support BMP9–10 heterodimerization, we generated unprocessed BMP variants by mutating amino acids in the furin-cleavage site, and we co-transfected mutated BMP9 with a wildtype (WT) BMP10 or vice versa. Heterodimerization of BMP9 and BMP10 was estimated by Western blotting as the association of a precursor and a mature BMP. For this, we removed the tags between the pro- and mature BMP domains. This enabled the full processing of pro-BMP9 and pro-BMP10, as shown by the single 23-kDa band revealed by Western blotting of CM issued from WT BMP9 or WT BMP10 single transfections (Fig. 1F). The BMP9 furin-cleavage site 316RKKR was mutated to 316RQKR, 316RQAR319, or 316RQAA319. The first mutant was generated to mimic a substitution mutation identified in a patient suffering from HHT (27.Hernandez F. Huether R. Carter L. Johnston T. Thompson J. Gossage J.R. Chao E. Elliott A.M. Mutations in RASA1 and GDF2 identified in patients with clinical features of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.Hum. Genome Var. 2015; 2 (27081547): 1504010.1038/hgv.2015.40Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The two others replaced basic amino acids by alanine residues to avoid furin cleavage. The single substitution of Lys317 to Gln317 did not impair BMP9 maturation (Fig. S2), thus indicating that HHT disease in this patient is not linked to a BMP9 processing defect as it had been suggested (27.Hernandez F. Huether R. Carter L. Johnston T. Thompson J. Gossage J.R. Chao E. Elliott A.M. Mutations in RASA1 and GDF2 identified in patients with clinical features of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.Hum.

The double mutant RQAR was only partially processed but could be completely cleaved when furin was overexpressed, whereas the triple mutant RQAA was not cleaved at all even in the presence of overexpressed furin (Fig. S2). Similarly, BMP10 313RIRR316 sequence was mutated to RIAA. Fig. 1F shows that, similarly to the BMP9 RQAA mutant, the BMP10 RIAA mutant was exclusively expressed as a 110-kDa precursor. Thus, these mutations inhibit BMP processing and consequently, their capacity to activate ALK1 in a BRE assay using transfected 3T3 cells (7.David L. Mallet C. Mazerbourg S. Feige J.J. Bailly S. Identification of BMP9 and BMP10 as functional activators of the orphan activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) in endothelial cells.Blood. 2007; 109 (17068149): 1953-196110.1182/blood-2006-07-034124Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, F and G). Interestingly, co-transfection of the BMP10 RIAA mutant with WT BMP9 gave rise to a new 65-kDa BMP9 immune reactive band (arrowhead), likely corresponding to the association of mature WT BMP9 to BMP10 precursor. Similar results could be obtained with co-transfection of the BMP9 RQAA mutant together with WT BMP10 (Fig. 1F). These chimeric proteins (B9WT/B10 RIAA; B10 WT/B9 RQAA) were also unable to activate ALK1 in the BRE assay (Fig. 1G). This demonstrated a dominant-negative effect of the mutant BMP on the activity of WT BMP9 or -10. Altogether, these results support that BMP9 and BMP10 form a disulfide-bonded heterodimer when coexpressed in the same cells. BMP9–10 heterodimers were purified in two steps using a HisTrapTM column followed by an affinity column grafted with anti-myc antibodies. The latter allowed separating His-BMP9 homodimers from BMP9–10 heterodimers. Elution was performed by lowering the pH to 3 (fraction containing mainly BMP9) and then to 2 (fraction containing BMP9–10 heterodimer) (Fig. S3). The mature BMP9–10 heterodimer was carefully quantified by Western blotting using known quantities of commercial BMP9 and BMP10 as standards under reduced (BMP9) or unreduced (BMP10) conditions (see Fig. 2A). The activity of BMP9–10 heterodimer was then determined on human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) transfected with the BRE-luc reporter plasmid. The BMP9–10 heterodimer displayed a similar stimulation pattern than BMP9 or BMP10 homodimer: induction started with low doses of ligand (25 pg/ml) and a plateau was obtained at doses higher than 250 pg/ml (Fig. 2B). We next addressed whether the activity of the BMP9–10 heterodimer was mediated by ALK1 signaling. To do this, we knocked down ALK1 expression by transfecting HUVECs with two different siRNA specific for ACVLR1. The activity of BMP9, BMP10, and BMP9–10 was then evaluated as above, using the BRE-luc reporter. The activities of BMP9, BMP10, and BMP9–10 were completely (siRNA#1) or severely (siRNA#2) abolished compared with transfection with scramble siRNA (Fig. 2C). The loss of activity was correlated with the level of ACVLR1 gene extinction (Fig. S4A). Moreover, we also found that BMP9, BMP10, and BMP9–10 lost their ability to induce the phosphorylation of Smad1–5, indicating that ALK1 is necessary for activating the Smad pathway in a similar way for the 3 ligands (Fig. S4B). To quantify BMP9–10 heterodimers, we set-up a cross-ELISA, using a capture anti-BMP9 antibody and a detection anti-BMP10 antibody, or the other way round, i.e. a capture anti-BMP10 antibody and a detection anti-BMP9 antibody. We compared their immune reactivities with those of standard BMP9 (12.Bidart M. Ricard N. Levet S. Samson M. Mallet C. David L. Subileau M. Tillet E. Feige J.J. Bailly S. BMP9 is produced by hepatocytes and circulates mainly in an active mature form complexed to its prodomain.Cell. Mol.

BMP9 and BMP10 ELISAs both specifically recognized homodimeric BMP9 or BMP10, respectively, but also allowed the detection of purified BMP9–10 heterodimer (Fig. S5, A and B). On the contrary, cross-BMP9–10 or cross-BMP10–9 ELISAs specifically only detected purified BMP9–10 heterodimers but not BMP9 or BMP10 homodimers (Fig. S5, C and D). Moreover, CM containing a mixture of BMP9 and BMP10 gave no signal, demonstrating that only disulfide-bonded heterodimer is recognized by these cross-ELISAs. Standard curves using purified BMP9–10 could be established and showed a sensitivity threshold around 30 pg/ml for both cross-ELISAs (Fig. S5, E and F). We then sought for the presence of heterodimeric BMP9–10 in mouse plasma. We took advantage of comparing WT and KO mice in which Bmp9 (19.Ricard N. Ciais D. Levet S. Subileau M. Mallet C. Zimmers T.A. Lee S.J. Bidart M. Feige J.J. Bailly S.

As Bmp10-KO is embryonic lethal, we generated conditional KO mice by crossing Bmp10-floxed mice with Rosa26-CreERT2 mice (28.Imayoshi I. Ohtsuka T. Metzger D. Chambon P. Kageyama R.

Deletion of Bmp10 was performed in 3-week-old mice by daily injection of tamoxifen for 5 days. Bmp10 knock-down efficiency was evaluated by RT-qualitative PCR on the right atria, 6 weeks after tamoxifen injection. A very strong, although not complete reduction in BMP10 levels was observed (Fig. S6A). Bmp10 deletion was also checked by measuring the ALK1–BRE activity from protein extracts of the right atria. In accordance with the mRNA levels, only 10% of ALK1–BRE activity remained 3 weeks after tamoxifen injections (Fig. S6B). Following Bmp10 deletion, mice were viable and did not display any obvious phenotype. We next measured the homo- and heterodimeric BMP9/10 species by ELISA. The results are presented as the immune reactivity as it is difficult to give the accurate concentrations of circulating BMP using ELISA: we are using mature recombinant proteins as standards but BMPs circulate under different forms (uncleaved, processed, and complexed) and we know that the antibodies might not recognize the different forms of BMPs with the same affinity (12.Bidart M.

As expected, BMP9 and BMP10 were detected in WT plasma (Fig. 3, A and B), but very interestingly, using a cross-BMP9–10 ELISA, we also found the presence of BMP9–10 heterodimers in WT plasma (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, BMP9–10 heterodimer was no more detected in the plasma of Bmp9-KO mice, and its level was also strongly reduced in Bmp10-cKO versus WT mice (Fig. 3C). This slight remaining level of heterodimer in Bmp10-cKO plasma is likely due to the incomplete knockdown of Bmp10 expression (Fig. S5, A and B) as circulating BMP10, measured by ELISA, was also not completely suppressed (10% residual immune reactivity) (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, we also observed a strong decrease in BMP9 levels in the plasma of Bmp10-cKO mice (Fig. 3A), supporting that a large part of BMP9 immune reactivity can be attributed to the BMP9–10 heterodimer. Similarly, we found a significant decrea"

In July 2016, a large, toxic cyanobacterial bloom occurred in Lake Okeechobee and throughout the St. Lucie River and Estuary, leading Florida to declare a state of emergency. This study reports on measurements and nutrient amendment experiments performed in this freshwater-estuarine ecosystem (salinity 0-25 PSU) during and after the bloom. In July, all sites along the bloom exhibited dissolved inorganic nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios < 6, while Microcystis dominated (> 95%) phytoplankton inventories from the lake to the central part of the estuary. Chlorophyll a and microcystin concentrations peaked (100 and 34 μg L-1, respectively) within Lake Okeechobee and decreased eastwards. Metagenomic analyses indicated that genes associated with the production of microcystin (mcyE) and the algal neurotoxin saxitoxin (sxtA) originated from Microcystis and multiple diazotrophic genera, respectively. There were highly significant correlations between levels of total nitrogen, microcystin, and microcystin synthesis gene abundance across all surveyed sites (p < 0.001), suggesting high levels of nitrogen supported the production of microcystin during this event. Consistent with this, experiments performed with low salinity water from the St. Lucie River during the event indicated that algal biomass was nitrogen-limited. In the fall, densities of Microcystis and concentrations of microcystin were significantly lower, green algae co-dominated with cyanobacteria, and multiple algal groups displayed nitrogen-limitation. These results indicate that monitoring and regulatory strategies in Lake Okeechobee and the St. Lucie River and Estuary should consider managing loads of nitrogen to control future algal and microcystin-producing cyanobacterial blooms."
https://openalex.org/W2803382460,"Objectives This study explores the impact of early motherhood on neonatal mortality, and how this differs between countries and regions. It assesses whether the risk of neonatal mortality is greater for younger adolescent mothers compared with mothers in later adolescence, and explores if differences reflect confounding socio-economic and health care utilisation factors. It also examines how the risks differ for first or subsequent pregnancies. Methods The analysis uses 64 Demographic and Health Surveys collected between 2005 and 2015 from 45 countries to explore the relationship between adolescent motherhood (disaggregated as <16 years, 16/17 years and 18/19 years) and neonatal mortality. Both unadjusted bivariate association and logistic regression are used. Regional level multivariate models that adjust for a range of socio-economic, demographic and health service utilisation variables are estimated. Further stratified models are created to examine the excess risk for first and subsequent births separately. Findings The risk of neonatal mortality in all regions was markedly greater for infants with mothers under 16 years old, although there was marked heterogeneity in patterns between regions. Adjusting for socio-economic, demographic and health service utilisation variables did not markedly change the odds ratios associated with age. The increased risks associated with adolescent motherhood are lowest for first births. Conclusion Our findings particularly highlight the importance of reducing adolescent births among the youngest age group as a strategy for addressing the problem of neonatal mortality, as well ensuring pregnant adolescents have access to quality maternal health services to protect the health of both themselves and their infants. The regional differences in increased risk are a novel finding which requires more exploration."

This region is Canada's premier growing area for the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Microplastics were found at all sampling locations indicating widespread contamination of this region with these particles. Three types of microplastics were recovered: microbeads, which occurred in the greatest number (up to 25000/kg dry sediment) and microfibers and microfragments, which were much less in number compared with microbeads and occurred in similar amounts (100-300/kg dry sediment). Microbeads were recovered primarily in the < 0.63 μm and 250-0.63 μm sediment size class, whereas microfragments and microfibers were generally identified in all 5 sediment size classes. Abundance and distribution of the three types of microplastics were spatially dependent with principal component analysis (PCA) indicating that 84 percent of the variation in abundance and distribution was due to the presence of high numbers of microbeads at three locations within the study region. At these sites, microbeads expressed as a percent component of the sediment by weight was similar to key geochemical components that govern trace metal behavior and availability to benthic organisms. Microbeads have been shown to accumulate metals from the aquatic environment, hence in addition to the traditional geochemical components such as silt and organic matter, microplastics also need to be considered as a sediment component that can influence trace metal geochemistry. Our findings have shown that BC's premier oyster growing region is highly contaminated with microplastics, notably microbeads. It would be prudent to assess the degree to which oysters from this region are ingesting microplastics. If so, it would have direct implications for Canada's oyster farming industry with respect to the health of the oyster and the quality of product that is being farmed and sets an example for other shellfish growing regions of the world."

Here, in a prospective clinical study of 142 CRC patients, we found that ABCB5 mRNA transcripts previously reported not to be significantly expressed in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells are significantly enriched in patient peripheral blood specimens compared with non-CRC controls and correlate with CRC disease progression. In human-to-mouse CRC tumor xenotransplantation models that exhibited circulating tumor mRNA, we observed that cancer-specific ABCB5 knockdown significantly reduced detection of these transcripts, suggesting that the knockdown inhibited tumor invasiveness. Mechanistically, this effect was associated with inhibition of expression and downstream signaling of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL), a proinvasive molecule herein shown to be produced by ABCB5-positive CRC cells. Importantly, rescue of AXL expression in ABCB5-knockdown CRC tumor cells restored tumor-specific transcript detection in the peripheral blood of xenograft recipients, indicating that ABCB5 regulates CRC invasiveness, at least in part, by enhancing AXL signaling. Our results implicate ABCB5 as a critical determinant of CRC invasiveness and suggest that ABCB5 blockade might represent a strategy in CRC therapy, even independently of ABCB5's function as an MDR mediator.

https://openalex.org/W2804611082,"Background A pervasive and persistent finding is the health disadvantage experienced by those in food insecure households. While clear associations have been identified between food insecurity and diabetes risk factors, less is known about the relationship between food insecurity and incident type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study is to investigate the association between household food insecurity and the future development of type 2 diabetes. Methods We used data from Ontario adult respondents to the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey, linked to health administrative data (n = 4,739). Food insecurity was assessed with the Household Food Security Survey Module and incident type 2 diabetes cases were identified by the Ontario Diabetes Database. Multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for type 2 diabetes as a function of food insecurity. Results Canadians in food insecure households had more than 2 times the risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared to those in food secure households [HR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.17–4.94]. Additional adjustment for BMI attenuated the association between food insecurity and type 2 diabetes [HR = 2.08, 95% CI = 0.99, 4.36]. Conclusions Our findings indicate that food insecurity is independently associated with increased diabetes risk, even after adjustment for a broad set of measured confounders. Examining diabetes risk from a broader perspective, including a comprehensive understanding of socioeconomic and biological pathways is paramount for informing policies and interventions aimed at mitigating the future burden of type 2 diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2804192468,"Understanding how vascular and metabolic factors impact on cognitive function is essential to develop efficient therapies to prevent and treat cognitive losses in older age. Cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and venous oxygenation (Yv) comprise key physiologic processes that maintain optimum functioning of neural activity. Changes to these parameters across the lifespan may precede neurodegeneration and contribute to age-related cognitive decline. This study examined differences in blood flow and metabolism between 31 healthy younger (<50 years) and 29 healthy older (>50 years) adults; and investigated whether these parameters contribute to cognitive performance.Participants underwent a cognitive assessment and MRI scan. Grey matter CMRO2 was calculated from measures of CBF (phase contrast MRI), arterial and venous oxygenation (TRUST MRI) to assess group differences in physiological function and the contribution of these parameters to cognition.Performance on memory (p<0.001) and attention tasks (p<0.001) and total CBF were reduced (p<0.05), and Yv trended toward a decrease (p = .06) in the older group, while grey matter CBF and CMRO2 did not differ between the age groups. Attention was negatively associated with CBF when adjusted (p<0.05) in the older adults, but not in the younger group. There was no such relationship with memory. Neither cognitive measure was associated with oxygen metabolism or venous oxygenation in either age group.Findings indicated an age-related imbalance between oxygen delivery, consumption and demand, evidenced by a decreased supply of oxygen with unchanged metabolism resulting in increased oxygen extraction. CBF predicted attention when the age-effect was controlled, suggesting a task- specific CBF- cognition relationship."

However, a direct link between somatotype three-numeral rating and anaerobic performance has not yet been reported. The purpose of this study was to assess the relations between somatotype and anaerobic performance using both singular and multivariate analyses. Thirty-six physically active males (mean ± standard deviation age 26.0 ± 9.8 years; body mass 79.5 ± 12.9 kg; height 1.82 ± 0.07 m) were somatotype-rated using the Heath-Carter method. Subjects were assessed for 3 repetition maximum (3 RM) bench press and back squat, and completed a 30-second maximal sprint cycle test. Positive correlations were observed between mesomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = 0.560, p < 0.001), mesomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = 0.550, p = 0.001) and between mesomorphy and minimum power output (r = 0.357, p = 0.033). Negative correlations were observed between ectomorphy and 3 RM bench press (r = -0.381, p = 0.022), and ectomorphy and 3 RM back squat (r = -0.336, p = 0.045). Individual regression analysis indicated that mesomorphy was the best predictor of 3 RM bench press performance, with 31.4% of variance in 3 RM bench press performance accounted for by the mesomorphy rating (p < 0.001). A combination of mesomorphy and ectomorphy best predicted 3 RM back squat performance (R2 = 0.388, p < 0.04). Around one third of strength performance is predicted by somatotype-assessed physique in physically active males. This could have important implications for the identification of those predisposed to perform well in sports containing strength-based movements and prescription of training programmes."

In well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma their clinical promise is associated with their ability to downregulate the MDM2 protein. The downregulation of MDM2 following treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors also induces many cultured tumor cell lines derived from different types of malignancies to progress from quiescence into senescence. Here we used cultured human cell lines and defined a role for PDLIM7 and CDH18, regulating MDM2 protein in CDK4/6 inhibitor-treated cells. Materials from our previous phase II trials with palbociclib were then used to demonstrate that expression of CDH18 protein was associated with response, measured as both progression-free survival and overall survival. This supports the hypothesis that the biologic transition from quiescence to senescence has clinical relevance for this class of drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2804978285,"Background/Aims Persistent incidents of food fraud in China have resulted in low levels of consumer trust in the authenticity and safety of food that is domestically produced. We examined the relationship between the concerns of Chinese consumers regarding food fraud, and the role that demonstrating authenticity may play in relieving those concerns. Methods A two-stage mixed method design research design was adopted. First, qualitative research (focus groups n = 7) was conducted in three Chinese cities, Beijing, Guangzhou and Chengdu to explore concerns held by Chinese consumers in relation to food fraud. A subsequent quantitative survey (n = 850) tested hypotheses derived from the qualitative research and theoretical literature regarding the relationship between attitudinal measures (including risk perceptions, social trust, and perceptions of benefit associated with demonstrating authenticity), and behavioral intention to purchase “authentic” European products using structural equation modelling. Results Chinese consumers perceive food fraud to be a hazard that represents a food safety risk. Food hazard concern was identified to be geographically influenced. Consumers in Chengdu (tier 2 city) possessed higher levels of hazard concern compared to consumers in Beijing and Guangzhou (tier 1). Structural trust (i.e. trust in actors and the governance of the food supply chain) was not a significant predictor of attitude and intention to purchase authenticated food products. Consumers were shown to have developed ‘risk-relieving’ strategies to compensate for the lack of trust in Chinese food and the dissonance experienced as a consequence of food fraud. Indexical and iconic authenticity cues provided by food manufacturers and regulators were important elements of product evaluations, although geographical differences in their perceived importance were observed. Conclusions Targeted communication of authenticity assurance measures, including; regulations; enforcement; product testing; and actions taken by industry may improve Chinese consumer trust in the domestic food supply chain and reduce consumer concerns regarding the food safety risks associated with food fraud. To support product differentiation and retain prestige, European food manufactures operating within the Chinese market should recognise regional disparities in consumer risk perceptions regarding food fraud and the importance of personal risk mitigation strategies adopted by Chinese consumers to support the identification of authentic products."

Anaesthesia is daily used in fish during experimental procedures to avoid discomfort, stress or pain. Also, fish welfare and the reliability of results can be compromised if an unsuitable anaesthetic protocol is used. Therefore, we aimed to refine anaesthetic protocols to be used in adult zebrafish by evaluating the efficacy of different anaesthetics, used alone or in combination. For that, zebrafish were randomly assigned to 8 different groups: 100 μg/mLMS-222 (MS); 0.2 μg/mL etomidate (E); 0.2 μg/mL etomidate + 100 μg/mL lidocaine (E+L); 1.25 μg/mL propofol (P); 1.25 μg/mL propofol + 100 μg/mL lidocaine (P+L); 100 μg/mL ketamine (K); 100 μg/mL ketamine + 1.25 μg/mL medetomidine (K+M); and 100 μg/mL ketamine + 1.25 μg/mL medetomidine/3.125 μg/mL atipamezole (K+M/A). The animals were placed in an anaesthetic water bath, then, the following parameters were registered: time for equilibrium loss and anaesthesia induction, loss of sensitivity to soft and painful stimuli, respiratory rate, recovery time, and activity after recovery. The combined forms of E+L, P+L and K+M were the fastest to induce a surgical anaesthetic stage. Nevertheless, E+L induced respiratory depression, while K+M was shown to have the longer recovery time compared to MS-222, even when atipamezole was added. In conclusion, the P+L combination was shown to provide good anaesthesia with analgesia, without causing a major respiratory depression, providing as well a quick recovery, similar to MS-222."

Tobacco smoking leads to more than 30% of all cancer deaths in developed countries, and ∼90% of male lung cancer deaths and 75–80% of female lung cancer deaths in the United States can be attributed to tobacco smoking (1.Shopland D.R.

The carcinogenic effects of NNN and NNK are thought to be attributed to their metabolic activation, the subsequent formation of DNA adducts, and the ensuing induction of mutations during DNA replication (4.Carlson E.S.

Both NNK and NNN can be metabolically activated by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, and the resulting metabolites can subsequently react with DNA to yield 4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobutyl (POB) adducts along with other DNA lesions (Fig. 1) (5.Crespi C.L.

Four POB adducts, including O2-POB-dT, O2-POB-cytosine, O6-POB-dG, and N7-POB-guanine, were found to accumulate at significant levels in DNA of lung tissues of NNK-treated rats (7.Hecht S.S.

Three of these adducts (O2-POB-dT, O6-POB-dG, and N7-POB-guanine) were detected in A/J mice upon exposure to another pyridyloxobutylating agent, 4-(acetoxymethylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNKOAc) (8.Peterson L.A.

In addition, it was found that exposure of cultured mammalian cells to NNKOAc could lead to the formation of appreciable levels of O4-POB-dT, along with the abovementioned O2-POB-dT and O6-POB-dG (10.Leng J.

In this vein, O2-POB-dT is highly blocking and miscoding during DNA replication in both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells (6.Weerasooriya S. Jasti V.P. Bose A. Spratt T.E. Basu A.K.

Likewise, O6-POB-dG is highly mutagenic, and it induces exclusively G→A transition in E. coli and both G→A and G→T mutations in cultured human cells (12.Pauly G.T. Peterson L.A. Moschel R.C.

To maintain genomic stability, cells are equipped with specialized translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases to bypass unrepaired DNA lesions. The Y family polymerases Pol η, ι, and κ and the B family polymerase Pol ζ, which interact with another Y family polymerase, REV1, assume major roles in translesion synthesis (16.Guo C.

Weerasooriya et al. (6.Weerasooriya S. Jasti V.P. Bose A. Spratt T.E. Basu A.K.

It remains unclear how other POB lesions impede DNA replication and how their replicative bypass is influenced by TLS polymerases. In this study, we constructed double-stranded plasmids containing site-specifically inserted O2-POB-dT, O4-POB-dT, and O6-POB-dG lesions (Fig. 1) and investigated how these lesions impair the efficiency and accuracy of DNA replication in HEK293T cells. We also examined the bypass efficiencies and mutation frequencies (MFs) of the three lesions in TLS polymerase-deficient cells. The main objective of this study was to assess how the three major stable POB adducts formed on nucleobases of DNA perturb the efficiency and fidelity of DNA replication in human cells and to reveal the identities of translesion synthesis DNA polymerases in bypassing these DNA lesions. We employed a previously described strand-specific PCR-competitive replication and adduct bypass (SSPCR-CRAB) assay for cellular replication experiments. The method involves the construction of a double-stranded plasmid carrying a single structurally defined lesion at a specific site, co-replication of the damage-containing plasmid with a damage-free competitor plasmid in cultured human cells, isolation of the progeny genomes, selective PCR amplification of the replication products of the strand initially carrying the lesion, restriction digestion of the PCR products, and identification/quantification of restriction fragments harboring the initial damage site using native PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis (Figs. 2 and 3) (18.You C.

In particular, we first synthesized oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) harboring a site-specifically incorporated O2-POB-dT, O4-POB-dT, and O6-POB-dG (The electrospray ionization-MS and MS/MS for these three lesion-containing ODNs are shown in Figs. S1–S3). We subsequently utilized a previously established protocol to produce double-stranded, lesion-housing plasmids as well as the corresponding control (dT or dG) plasmids (Fig. 2) (18.You C.

We also constructed a competitor vector that contained three additional nucleotides in the region between the two restriction cleavage sites and served as an internal reference for gauging the extent to which the DNA lesion impeded DNA replication. The competitor vector was co-transfected at fixed molar ratios with the lesion-harboring or control plasmids into HEK293T cells or isogenic cells, with Pol η, Pol ι, Pol κ, Pol ζ, or both Pol η and Pol ζ being depleted by the CRISPR-Cas9 genomic editing method (Fig. S4 shows the sequencing results for confirming the dual knockout of Pol η and Pol ζ). At 24 h following transfection, the progeny genomes were isolated, followed by DpnI and exonuclease III digestion to eliminate the residual unreplicated plasmids.Figure 3Restriction digestion and post-labeling method for determining the bypass efficiencies and mutation frequencies of the lesions in HEK293T cells and the isogenic TLS polymerase-deficient cells.

The forward P1 primer contains a G as the terminal 3′ nucleotide corresponding to the C/C mismatch locus (Fig. 2), which facilitates the selective amplification of the progeny genomes from the replication of the lesion-containing strand. Furthermore, a C/A mismatch was incorporated at three nucleotides from its 3′ terminus in the P1 primer to enhance the specificity of SSPCR, as noted previously (Fig. 2) (19.Wu J. Li L. Wang P. You C. Williams N.L. Wang Y. Translesion synthesis of O4-alkylthymidine lesions in human cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27466394): 9256-9265PubMed Google Scholar). The final PCR amplicon (520 bp) was digested with NcoI/SfaNI or MluCI/Cac8I (Fig. 3, A and C). The restriction fragments were subsequently analyzed using native PAGE (Fig. 3, B and D, and Figs. S5 and S6) and LC-MS/MS to identify the mutagenic products induced from the cellular replication of the POB lesions (Figs. S7–S9; see details under “Experimental procedures”). The quantification data from native PAGE analyses were then employed for calculating the values of relative bypass efficiency (RBE) and MF. Our PAGE analysis results revealed that O2-POB-dT significantly blocked DNA replication in HEK293T cells, with the RBE value being ∼54% (Fig. 4A and Table S1). Deletion of Pol κ did not exert any pronounced effect on the bypass efficiency of the lesion. In contrast, the bypass efficiencies decreased by 66–72% in cells deficient in Pol η, Pol ι, or Pol ζ (Fig. 4A and Table S1), suggesting the involvement of multiple TLS polymerases in bypassing this lesion. The bypass efficiency of O4-POB-dT (26.7%) was the lowest among the three lesions in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4A and Table S1). Individual knockouts of Pol η or Pol ζ led to diminished bypass efficiencies of the lesion (to ∼16% and 13%, respectively; Fig. 4A and Table S1), although depletion of Pol κ or Pol ι did not appreciably alter the bypass efficiency of the lesion. This result underscored the roles of Pol η and Pol ζ in bypassing the O4-POB-dT lesion in human cells, which is in keeping with what were observed previously for other O4-alkyl-dT lesions (19.Wu J. Li L. Wang P. You C. Williams N.L. Wang Y. Translesion synthesis of O4-alkylthymidine lesions in human cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (27466394): 9256-9265PubMed Google Scholar). Different from O2- and O4-POB-dT, O6-POB-dG only slightly blocked DNA replication in HEK293T cells, with the bypass efficiency being ∼82% (Fig. 4A and Table S1). However, the bypass efficiencies for O6-POB-dG were significantly decreased in cells lacking any of the four TLS polymerases, where the bypass efficiencies were ∼22%, 60%, 37%, and 51% in cells deficient in Pol η, Pol κ, Pol ι, and Pol ζ, respectively (Fig. 4A and Table S1). Because both Pol η and Pol ζ are involved in bypassing all three POB lesions, we knocked out both polymerases in HEK293T cells with the CRISPR-Cas9 method (Fig. S4) and conducted replication experiments for the three aforementioned lesions in these cells. Our results showed that both O2-POB-dT and O4-POB-dT displayed lower bypass efficiencies in the double knockout cells than in the isogenic cells depleted of Pol η or Pol ζ alone (Fig. 4A and Table S1). However, further deletion of Pol ζ in the Pol η-deficient background did not further reduce the bypass efficiency of O6-POB-dG, supporting a key role of Pol η in bypassing this lesion (Fig. 4A and Table S1). We next employed a combination of LC-MS/MS with PAGE analyses to assess the mutagenic properties of the three POB adducts. Our data showed that O2-POB-dT was moderately mutagenic in HEK293T cells, and it gave rise to T→A transversion at a frequency of 14.9% (Fig. 4B and Table S2). Furthermore, significant diminutions in mutation frequencies were observed in the isogenic background with the depletion of each of the four TLS polymerases (Fig. 4B and Table S2), indicating the involvement of multiple polymerases in the mutagenic bypass of the lesion. O4-POB-dT induces exclusively T→C transition mutation at a frequency of ∼35.2% in HEK293T cells (Figs. 3, B and D, and 4C and Table S2). Although deletion of Pol κ or Pol ι did not lead to any apparent alteration in mutation frequency for the lesion, depletion of Pol η or Pol ζ conveyed significant decreases in the frequencies of T→C mutations to ∼26.6% and ∼21.1%, respectively (Fig. 4C and Table S2). A further drop in mutation frequency was observed in Pol η/Pol ζ-double knockout cells (to ∼14.2%; Fig. 4C and Table S2). These findings are in agreement with the above results of bypass efficiencies and demonstrate that, among the four TLS polymerases studied, only Pol η and Pol ζ are involved in the replicative bypass of the O4-POB-dT lesion. O6-POB-dG is strongly miscoding, and it induces mainly G→A transition (73.8%), which is accompanied by a low frequency (2.9%) of G→T transversion (Fig. 4D and Table S2). In addition, the mutagenic properties of the lesion were not significantly altered upon depletion of Pol η, Pol κ, Pol ι, or Pol ζ alone or Pol η and Pol ζ in combination (Fig. 4D and Table S2). Tobacco and its smoke contain at least 70 known carcinogens, and tobacco smoking increases the risk of many types of human cancer (3.Hecht S.S.

After metabolic activation, the tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines NNK and NNN, which are classified as group I carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, can result in the formation of a variety of POB DNA adducts (Fig. 1) (2.Pfeifer G.P.

Understanding the cytotoxic and mutagenic properties of DNA adducts induced by tobacco-specific carcinogens may help the fight against smoking-related diseases. It was found previously that the minor groove O2-POB-dT adduct is poorly repaired and moderately mutagenic (6.Weerasooriya S. Jasti V.P. Bose A. Spratt T.E. Basu A.K.

In addition, replication studies in cultured human cells with individual TLS polymerases being knocked down with siRNA revealed the involvement of Pol η and Pol ζ in bypassing the O2-POB-dT lesion (6.Weerasooriya S.

By generating different developmental stage-specific conditional activations in mice, we define a restricted developmental window during which conditional activation of Smo in Prostaglandin D2-synthase-positive mesoderm-derived meningeal layer of the skull base results in meningothelial meningioma formation. We show a selective vulnerability of the arachnoid from the skull base to Smo activation to initiate tumor development. This prenatal period and specific topography are correlated to the timing and location of SHH signaling involvement in the formation of craniofacial and meninges patterning, strongly corroborating the hypothesis of a developmental origin for Smo-activated meningiomas. Finally, we provide preclinical in vitro evidence of the efficacy of the SMO-inhibitor Sonidegib, supporting further preclinical and clinical evaluation of targeted treatment for refractory SMO-mutant meningiomas."

We found that the C-terminal 20-amino acid-long region of Jen1 contains an amino acid sequence required for association of Jen1 to the α-arrestin Rod1, as well as lysine residues important for glucose-induced Jen1 ubiquitination. Notably, fusion of this region to the methionine permease, Mup1, whose endocytosis is normally induced by excess methionine, was sufficient for Mup1 to undergo glucose-induced, Rod1-mediated endocytosis.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying how the Sirt1 functions are regulated remain vague. Herein we identified that the Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) interacts with Sirt1 and catalyzes its phosphorylation at the tyrosine residues of 280 and 301, both of which are highly conserved and located in the histone deacetylase catalytic domain of Sirt1. IL-6 stimulation enhanced Sirt1 interaction with JAK1 and JAK1-mediated Sirt1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, JAK1-mediated Sirt1 phosphorylation did not alter Sirt1 deacetylase catalytic activity, but instead it is required for Sirt1 interaction with the downstream transcription factor STAT3. JAK1-mediated phosphorylation enhanced Sirt1 suppression of STAT3 acetylation and transcriptional activity. As a consequence, Sirt1 activation attenuates IL-6 activity in protecting cancer cells from chemotherapeutic drug–induced apoptosis. Our studies identify JAK1 as a previously unappreciated tyrosine kinase of Sirt1 and reveal a novel negative feedback of the JAK1-STAT3 pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2803681421,"Typically it takes up to 10 seconds or more to induce a visual illusion of self-motion (“vection”). However, for this vection to be most useful in virtual reality and vehicle simulation, it needs to be induced quickly, if not immediately. This study examined whether vection onset latency could be reduced towards zero using visual display manipulations alone. In the main experiments, visual self-motion simulations were presented to observers via either a large external display or a head-mounted display (HMD). Priming observers with visually simulated viewpoint oscillation for just ten seconds before the main self-motion display was found to markedly reduce vection onset latencies (and also increase ratings of vection strength) in both experiments. As in earlier studies, incorporating this simulated viewpoint oscillation into the self-motion displays themselves was also found to improve vection. Average onset latencies were reduced from 8-9s in the no oscillating control condition to as little as 4.6 s (for external displays) or 1.7 s (for HMDs) in the combined oscillation condition (when both the visual prime and the main self-motion display were oscillating). As these display manipulations did not appear to increase the likelihood or severity of motion sickness in the current study, they could possibly be used to enhance computer generated simulation experiences and training in the future, at no additional cost."

We aimed to analyze the prognostic and predictive role of angiogenic factors in GEP-NENs through the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VEGF-A, VEGFR2 and VEGFR3. The genomic DNA of 58 consecutive patients with GEP-NENs treated at our Institution was extracted from peripheral blood. Two SNPs were identified respectively in VEGF-A (rs2010963G>C, rs699947A>C), VEGFR-2 (rs2305948C>T, rs1870377T>A), and VEGFR-3 (rs307821T>C, rs307826C>A) gene. Gene polymorphisms were determined by Real-Time PCR using TaqMan assays. Median age was 57 years (range 24–79 years); 32 patients were male and 77.5% of NENs were localized in the pancreas. The allele frequency of VEGFR-2 rs2305948T and of VEGF-A rs2010963C showed a trend of higher frequency than in general population (12.1% vs. 8.0% and 34.5% vs. 31.2%, respectively). Three out SNPs (VEGF-A rs699947C, VEGF-A rs2010963GC and VEGFR-3 rs307821C) showed a correlation with an increased risk of disease relapse. Moreover median PFS changes according to the presence of 0–1 SNPs (20.7% of cases; 61.9 months), 2 SNPs (25.9%; 49.2 months) and 3 SNPs (53.4%; 27.8 months) (p = 0.034). Results suggest, for the first time, that specific SNPs in VEGF-A and VEGFR-3 correlate with poor prognosis in GEP-NENs. The identification of this new prognostic factor might be helpful in order to optimize the management of these heterogeneous neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W2804175704,"NANOG has been demonstrated to play an essential role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells, and its pseudogene, NANOGP8, is suggested to promote the cancer stem cell phenotype. As the roles of these genes are intimately involved with glioblastoma multiforme progression and exosomes are critical in intercellular communication, we conducted a detailed analysis of the association of the NANOG gene family with exosomes to identify diagnostic markers for cancer. Exosomes were precipitated from conditioned culture media from various cell lines, and NANOG gene fragments were directly amplified without DNA isolation using multiple primer sets. The use of the enzymes AlwNI and SmaI with restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis functioned to distinguish NANOGP8 from other NANOG family members. Collectively, results suggest that the NANOG DNA associated with exosomes is not full length and that mixed populations of the NANOG gene family exist. Furthermore, sequence analysis of exosomal DNA amplified with a NANOGP8 specific primer set frequently showed an insertion of a 22 bp sequence into the 3’ UTR. The occurrence rate of this insertion was significantly higher in exosomal DNA clones from cancer cells as compared to normal cells. We have detected mixed populations of NANOG DNA associated with exosomes and have identified preferential modulations in the sequences from cancer samples. Our findings, coupled with the properties of exosomes, may allow for the detection of traditionally inaccessible cancers (i.e. GBM) through minimally invasive techniques. Further analysis of exosomal DNA sequences of NANOG and other embryonic stemness genes (OCT3/4, SOX2, etc.) may establish a robust collection of exosome based diagnostic markers, and further elucidate the mechanisms of cancer formation, progression, and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2803589761,"The polarity proteins Par3 and aPKC are key regulators of processes altered in cancer. Par3/aPKC are thought to dynamically interact with Par6 but increasing evidence suggests that aPKC and Par3 also exert complex-independent functions. Whereas aPKCλ serves as tumor promotor, Par3 can either promote or suppress tumorigenesis. Here we asked whether and how Par3 and aPKCλ genetically interact to control two-stage skin carcinogenesis. Epidermal loss of Par3, aPKCλ, or both, strongly reduced tumor multiplicity and increased latency but inhibited invasion to similar extents, indicating that Par3 and aPKCλ function as a complex to promote tumorigenesis. Molecularly, Par3/aPKCλ cooperate to promote Akt, ERK and NF-κB signaling during tumor initiation to sustain growth, whereas aPKCλ dominates in promoting survival. In the inflammatory tumorigenesis phase Par3/aPKCλ cooperate to drive Stat3 activation and hyperproliferation. Unexpectedly, the reduced inflammatory signaling did not alter carcinogen-induced immune cell numbers but reduced IL-4 Receptor-positive stromal macrophage numbers in all mutant mice, suggesting that epidermal aPKCλ and Par3 promote a tumor-permissive environment. Importantly, aPKCλ also serves a distinct, carcinogen-independent role in controlling skin immune cell homeostasis. Collectively, our data demonstrates that Par3 and aPKCλ cooperate to promote skin tumor initiation and progression, likely through sustaining growth, survival, and inflammatory signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2804122997,"Globally there are many examples of synanthropic carnivores exploiting growth in urbanisation. As carnivores can come into conflict with humans and are potential vectors of zoonotic disease, assessing densities in suburban areas and identifying factors that influence them are necessary to aid management and mitigation. However, fragmented, privately owned land restricts the use of conventional carnivore surveying techniques in these areas, requiring development of novel methods. We present a method that combines questionnaire distribution to residents with field surveys and GIS, to determine relative density of two urban carnivores in England, Great Britain. We determined the density of: red fox (Vulpes vulpes) social groups in 14, approximately 1km2 suburban areas in 8 different towns and cities; and Eurasian badger (Meles meles) social groups in three suburban areas of one city. Average relative fox group density (FGD) was 3.72 km-2, which was double the estimates for cities with resident foxes in the 1980's. Density was comparable to an alternative estimate derived from trapping and GPS-tracking, indicating the validity of the method. However, FGD did not correlate with a national dataset based on fox sightings, indicating unreliability of the national data to determine actual densities or to extrapolate a national population estimate. Using species-specific clustering units that reflect social organisation, the method was additionally applied to suburban badgers to derive relative badger group density (BGD) for one city (Brighton, 2.41 km-2). We demonstrate that citizen science approaches can effectively obtain data to assess suburban carnivore density, however publicly derived national data sets need to be locally validated before extrapolations can be undertaken. The method we present for assessing densities of foxes and badgers in British towns and cities is also adaptable to other urban carnivores elsewhere. However this transferability is contingent on species traits meeting particular criteria, and on resident responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2804702589,"The incidence of uterine rupture through a previous cesarean scar (CS) is declining as a result of a lower parity and fewer options for vaginal birth after cesarean. However, uterine ruptures attributable to other causes that traumatize the myometrium are on the rise. To determine whether changes in the causes of uterine rupture had occurred in recent years, we retrospective retrieved the clinical records of all singletons with uterine rupture observed in the delivery room of a Taiwanese tertiary obstetric center over a 15-year period. The overall uterine rupture rate was 3.8 per 10,000 deliveries. A total of 22 cases in 20 women (with two of them experiencing two episodes). Seven uterine ruptures occurred through a previous cesarean scar (CS ruptures, 32%), 13 through a non-cesarean scar (non-CS ruptures, 59%), whereas the remaining two (9%) were in women who did not previously undergo any surgery. All of the 13 non-CS ruptures were identified in women with a history of laparoscopic procedures to the uterus. Specifically, 10 (76%) occurred after a previous laparoscopic myomectomy, one (8%) following a hysteroscopic myomectomy, and two (16%) after a laparoscopic wedge resection of cornual ectopic pregnancy. Severe bleeding (blood loss >1500 mL) requiring transfusions was more frequent in women who experienced non-CS compared with CS ruptures (10 versus 1 case, respectively, P = 0.024). Patients with a history of endoscopic uterine surgery should be aware of uterine rupture during pregnancy."

A Kaplan-Meier curve was used to estimate the median survival time. Bivariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fitted to identify the predictors of mortality.A total of 271 TB/HIV co-infected children were included in the analysis. Of these, 38(14.02%) children were died during the follow-up period. This gives a total of 1167.67 child-years of observations. The overall mortality rate was 3.27(95%CI: 2.3-4.5) per 100 child-years.

https://openalex.org/W2804970071,"Objective Successfully stopping or reducing treatment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in low disease activity (LDA) may improve cost-effectiveness of care. We evaluated the multi-biomarker disease activity (MBDA) score as a predictor of disease relapse after discontinuation of TNF inhibitor (TNFi) treatment. Methods 439 RA patients who were randomized to stop TNFi treatment in the POET study were analyzed post-hoc. Three indicators of disease relapse were assessed over 12 months: 1) restarting TNFi treatment, 2) escalation of any DMARD therapy and 3) physician-reported flare. MBDA score was assessed at baseline. Associations between MBDA score and disease relapse were examined using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Results At baseline, 50.1%, 35.3% and 14.6% of patients had low (<30), moderate (30−44) or high (>44) MBDA scores. Within 12 months, 49.9% of patients had restarted TNFi medication, 59.0% had escalation of any DMARD and 57.2% had ≥1 physician-reported flare. MBDA score was associated with each indicator of relapse. At least one indicator of relapse was observed in 59.5%, 68.4% and 81.3% of patients with low, moderate or high MBDA scores, respectively (P = 0.004). Adjusted for baseline DAS28-ESR, disease duration, BMI and erosions, high MBDA scores were associated with increased risk for restarting TNFi treatment (OR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.00–3.40), DMARD escalation (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.01–3.94) and physician-reported flare (OR = 2.00, 95% 1.06–3.77). Conclusion For RA patients with stable LDA who stopped TNFi, a high baseline MBDA score was independently predictive of disease relapse within 12 months. The MBDA score may be useful for identifying patients at risk of relapse after TNFi discontinuation."
https://openalex.org/W2803230041,"Importance When patients are disorientated or experience language barriers, it is impossible to activate the emergency response system. In these cases, the delay for receiving appropriate help can extend to several hours. Objectives A worldwide emergency call support system (ECSS), including geolocation of modern smartphones (GPS, WLAN and LBS), was established referring to E911 and eCall systems. The system was tested for relevance in quickly forwarding abroad emergency calls to emergency medical services (EMS). Design To verify that geolocation data from smartphones are exact enough to be used for emergency cases, the accuracy of GPS (global positioning system), Wi-Fi (wireless LAN network) and LBS (location based system) was tested in eleven different countries and compared to actual location. The main objective was analyzed by simulation of emergencies in different countries. The time delay in receiving help in unsuccessful emergency call cases by using the worldwide emergency call support system (ECSS) was measured. Results GPS is the gold standard to locate patients with an average accuracy of 2.0 ± 3.3 m. Wi-Fi can be used within buildings with an accuracy of 7.0 ± 24.1 m. Using ECSS, the emergency call leads to a successful activation of EMS in 22.8 ± 10.8 min (Median 21 min). The use of a simple app with one button to touch did never cause any delay. Conclusions and relevance The worldwide emergency call support system (ECSS) significantly improves the emergency response in cases of disorientated patients or language barriers. Under circumstances without ECSS, help can be delayed by 2 or more hours and might have relevant lifesaving effects. This is the first time that Wi-Fi geolocation could prove to be a useful improvement in emergencies to enhance GPS, especially within or close to buildings."

Methods Concurrent validity and inter-scale agreement were examined by Pearson correlation of the total scores between the original and alternate versions and the Bland-Altman Method. Criterion validity of the two alternate versions in differentiating patients with Mild NCD was tested using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. One-month test-retest and inter-rater reliability were examined in 20 participants. Internal consistency of the alternate versions was measured by the Cronbach’s α. Results 30 controls (age 73.4 [4.5] years, 60% female) and 30 patients (age 75.4 [5.5] years, 73% female) with Mild NCD were recruited. Both alternate versions significantly correlated with the original version (r = 0.79–0.87, p<0.001). Mean differences of 0.17 and -0.40 points were found between the total scores of the alternate with the original versions with a consistent level of agreement observed throughout the range of cognitive abilities. Both alternate versions significantly differentiated patients with Mild NCD from healthy controls (area under ROC 0.922 and 0.724, p<0.001) and showed good one-month test-retest reliability (intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.92 and 0.82) and inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.99 and 0.87) and high internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.79 and 0.75).

FECD causes corneal stromal and epithelial edema and progressively develops into bullous keratopathy, which can eventually lead to blindness. However, the exact pathogenesis is unknown. In this study, we performed an in-depth bioinformatic analysis of the dataset GSE74123 to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of symptomatic late-onset FECD compared with a normal control. Gene ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis were used to analyze the pathological molecular mechanism of FECD. We found that cell senescence, reactive oxygen species (ROS), the extracellular matrix (ECM), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune response-related genes play an important role in the pathological development of symptomatic late-onset FECD. In addition, we revealed that down-regulated IL-6, enhanced NF-κB activity and a suite of orchestrated chemokine responses induce fibrocyte differentiation from monocyte to dendritic cell maturation. PI3K plays a key role in the molecular mechanism of symptomatic late-onset FECD. This study enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanism of FECD pathogenesis and will improve the diagnostics and therapy of FECD patients in the future."

https://openalex.org/W2803962890,"Child homicide is the most extreme form of violence against children. Within South Africa, children face the highest risk of homicide by parents/caregivers. It is suggested that prolonged exposure to adverse relationships with one’s own parents may be linked to committing child homicide as it may lead to psychological damage and disturb neurological functioning. This paper explores the adverse parent-child relationships of 22 men and women incarcerated for the murder of either a biological child, a stepchild or a child in their care and draws on 49 in-depth interviews with these participants. We illustrate that traumatic parent-child experiences in the form of absent parents, neglect and abuse have a profound impact on establishing unhealthy attachment styles and emphasize the importance of early adverse parent-child bonds in setting the tone for future bonds as adults. The pathway to adopting an adverse attachment with one’s own child is argued to be influenced by these early traumatic emotional experiences within the home. This study highlights the need to acknowledge the impact that adverse parent-child experiences have on the formation of violent forms of parental behavior. It is imperative to reduce children’s emotional vulnerabilities by implementing strategies to strengthen current parenting practices, to promote the development of less violent parent-child relationships and to work towards resolving parents’ experiences of trauma in reducing child homicide."

By strain-genotyping all field-collected individuals we found that populations collected from corn were composed primarily of corn-strain individuals, while the population collected from rice was composed almost entirely of rice-strain individuals. Outlier analyses indicated 1,184 loci putatively under selection (ca. 15% of the total) related to 194 different Gene Ontologies (GOs); the most numerous GOs were nucleotide binding, ATP binding, metal-ion binding and nucleic-acid binding. The association analyses indicated 326 loci associated with the host plant, and 216 loci associated with the individual strain, including functions related to Bacillus thuringiensis and insecticide resistance. The genetic-structure analyses indicated a moderate level of differentiation among all populations, and lower genetic structure among populations collected exclusively from corn, which suggests that the population collected from rice has a strong influence on the overall genetic structure. Populations of S. frugiperda are structured partially due to the host plant, and pairs of populations using the same host plant are more genetically similar than pairs using different hosts. Loci putatively under selection are the main factors responsible for the genetic structure of these populations, which indicates that adaptive selection on important traits, including the response to control tactics, is acting in the genetic differentiation of FAW populations in Brazil."

Because, RNTCP has limited capacity to involve the NFHPs, an implementation research project was conceived, whereby an external partner would engage with the NFHPs to enable them to identify early TB symptomatics from this key sub-population who would be then tested using Xpert MTB/RIF technology. Diagnosed TB cases among them would be referred promptly to RNTCP for treatment. This paper aimed to describe the project and its impact.Adopting a quasi-experimental before-after design, four RNTCP units from two major urban-industrial areas of Odisha were selected for intervention, which spanned five quarters and covered 151,400 people, of which 30% were slum-dwelling migrants. Two similar units comprised the control population. The hypothesis was, reaching the under reached in the intervention area through NFHPs would increase TB notification from these traditionally under-notifying units. RNTCP notification data during intervention was compared with pre-intervention era, adjusted for contemporaneous changes in control population.The project detected 488 Xpert+ TB cases, of whom 466 were administered RNTCP treatment. This translated into notification of additional 198 new bacteriologically positive cases to RNTCP, a 30% notification surge, after adjustment for 2% decline in control. This meant an average quarterly increase in notification of 41.20(20.08, 62.31; p<0.001) cases. The increase was immediate, evident from the rise in level in the time series analysis by 50.42(10.28, 90.55; p = 0.02) cases.Engagement with NFHPs contributed to an increase in TB notification to RNTCP from key under reached, slum-dwelling migrant populations."
https://openalex.org/W2949675418,"The dentate gyrus is essential for remembering the fine details of experiences that comprise episodic memory. Dentate gyrus granule cells receive highly-processed sensory information and are hypothesized to perform a pattern separation function, whereby similar sensory inputs are transformed into orthogonal neural representations. Behaviorally, this is believed to enable distinct memory for highly interfering stimuli. Since the dentate gyrus is comprised of a large number of adult-born neurons, which have unique synaptic wiring and neurophysiological firing patterns, it has been proposed that neurogenesis may contribute to this process in unique ways. Some behavioral evidence exists to support this role, whereby neurogenesis-deficient rodents are impaired at discriminating the fine visuospatial details of experiences. However, the extent to which newborn neurons contribute to dentate gyrus-dependent learning tasks is unclear. Furthermore, since most studies of dentate gyrus function are conducted in male rats, little is known about how females perform in similar situations, and whether there might be sex differences in the function of adult neurogenesis. To address these issues, we examined spatial discrimination memory in transgenic male and female rats that lacked adult neurogenesis. The first task probed memory for the position of local objects in an open field, assessed by behavioral responses to novel object locations. The second task examined memory for distal environmental cues. All rats were able to successfully discriminate local and distal cue changes. Males and females also performed comparably, although females displayed higher levels of rearing and locomotion. Collectively, our results indicate that rats are capable of learning about local and distal cues in the absence of adult neurogenesis."

Various methods have been proposed for the management of patients with scaphoid non-union and to reduce the risk of complications. In this study, our aim was to evaluate the clinical and functional outcomes of using a vascularized bone graft in the treatment of scaphoid non-union.Patients with scaphoid non-union who underwent 1,2 intercompartmental supraretinacular artery pedicled vascularized bone graft between January 2005 and January 2011 were enrolled. The parameters assessed included clinical and functional outcomes, radiological measures, and potential risk factors.Forty-one patients were finally included. Thirty patients achieved union (73%) and 11 did not. Smoking was a significant risk factor for non-union after the surgery. In patients who achieved union, grip strength and radioulnar abduction were greater in comparison to that in patients who did not achieve union. Functional measures, including the Disabilities of Arm and Shoulder score and the Modified Mayo Wrist Score, improved in patients with scaphoid union. The scaphoid length also improved significantly postoperatively in these patients.Surgical treatment of scaphoid non-union using vascularized bone graft led to a high union rate with good clinical and functional outcomes. Smoking is a risk factor for non-union, even with the use of a vascularized bone graft. Avascular necrosis was not associated with an increased risk for non-union."
https://openalex.org/W2804504782,"Cottonseed cake biomass, which is a residue of oil extraction, is potentially appropriate for use as animal feed, given the high mineral, fibre and protein content. The presence of free gossypol, however, a toxic pigment in the glands of the cotton plant, limits use of this biomass for monogastric livestock. A promising method to detoxify cottonseed cake relies on fermentation by fungi, which can eliminate up to 100% of gossypol. In order to quantify trace levels of free gossypol in different cotton materials, including cottonseed cake treated with macrofungi, a simple and rapid chromatographic detection method was developed and validated. Under optimized conditions, extraction was performed using 70% acetone. The extract was then analysed by Ultra High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC), with gradient elution on a C18 reverse phase column KINETEX® (100 x 2.10 mm, 2.6 μm). Methanol-0.1% TFA aqueous solution was employed as mobile phase and PDA detection conducted at 254 nm. The optimized method was validated by analysis of specificity, linearity and range, limit of detection, limit of quantification, precision and accuracy. Detection and quantification limits were observed at 0.2 and 0.5 μg/mL, respectively. With good reproducibility, with precision (RSD)<10% and recovery greater than 94%, the developed assay was appropriate for quantification of low quantities of free gossypol. The validated method was successfully applied to determine trace levels of free gossypol cottonseed treated with a macrofungus."
https://openalex.org/W2805011644,"The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of xenobiotic mixtures containing persistent organic pollutants isolated from commercial fish oil samples against sex hormone receptors, including estrogen and androgen. The applied bioassay was based on transgenic yeast strains. The mixtures were extracted from the samples using the semi-permeable membrane dialysis technique and analyzed with gas chromatography/ion trap mass spectrometry. It turned out that mixtures of chemicals isolated from fish oil may interact with human steroid sex hormone receptors in various ways: the tested samples showed both estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity. Calculated 17β-estradiol equivalents for the tested samples ranged between 0.003 and 0.073 pg g-1 (fat). Anti-androgenic activity expressed as the flutamide equivalent concentration was in the 18.58-216.21 ng g-1 (fat) range. Polychlorinated biphenyls and various DDT metabolites were the main fish oil pollutants influencing the receptors. Additivity and/or synergy between chemicals was observed in the ER/AR mediated response."

The role of wound dressings in the prevention of SSI after breast cancer surgery is unclear. This study compares a silver carboxymethylcellulose dressing (AQUACEL Ag Surgical (Aquacel) with standard wound dressing in SSI rate after breast cancer surgery.A single-centre randomized controlled trial among women ≥18 years, diagnosed with breast cancer, undergoing breast conserving or ablative surgery, was conducted in a combined in and outpatient setting. The intervention was the use of Aquacel, compared with standard gauze dressing. Primary outcome measure was SSI following CDC criteria.A total of 230 patients were analysed: 106 in the Aquacel group and 124 controls. Seven patients (6.6%) developed SSI in the Aquacel group and 16 patients (12.9%) in the control group (RR 0.51 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.22-1.20]; p = 0.112; adjusted OR 0.49 [0.19-1.25] p = 0.135)). Unplanned exploratory subgroup analysis of breast conserving surgery patients showed that SSI rate was 1/56 (1.8%) in the Aquacel group vs. 7/65 (10.8%) in controls; adjusted OR 0.15 [0.02-1.31] p = 0.087. The Aquacel group showed better patient satisfaction (median 8 vs. 7 on a Numerical Rating Scale, p = 0.006), fewer dressing changes within 48 hours(adjusted OR 0.12 [0.05-0.27] p<0.001), fewer re-operations (0% vs. 3.2%, p = 0.062), and lower mean wound-related treatment costs, both in a high (€265.42 (SD = 908) vs. €470.65 (SD = 1223) [p<0.001]) and low (€59.12 (SD = 129) vs. €67.55 (SD = 172) [p<0.001]) attributable costs of SSI model.In this randomized controlled trial in women undergoing surgery for breast cancer, the use of AQUACEL Ag Surgical wound dressing did not significantly reduce the occurrence of SSIs compared to standard gauze dressing. The use of Aquacel resulted in significantly improved patient satisfaction, reduced dressing changes and reduced wound-related costs.www.trialregister.nl: NTR5840."
https://openalex.org/W2765469954,"Background Substance misuse persists as a major public health issue worldwide with significant costs for society. The development of interventions requires methodologically sound studies to explore substance misuse causes and consequences. This Cohort description paper outlines the design of the Belfast Youth Development (BYDS), one of the largest cohort studies of its kind in the UK. The study was established to address the need for a long-term prospective cohort study to investigate the initiation, persistence and desistance of substance use, alongside life course processes in adolescence and adulthood. The paper provides an overview of BYDS as a longitudinal data source for investigating substance misuse and outlines the study measures, sample retention and characteristics. We also outline how the BYDS data have been used to date and highlight areas ripe for future work by interested researchers. Methods The study began in 2000/1 when participants (n = 3,834) were pupils in their first year of post-primary education (age 10/11 years, school year 8) from over 40 schools in Northern Ireland. Children were followed during the school years: Year 9 (in 2002; aged 12; n = 4,343), Year 10 (in 2003; aged 13; n = 4,522), Year 11 (in 2004; aged 14; n = 3,965) and Year 12 (in 2005; aged 15; n = 3,830) and on two more occasions: 2006/07 (aged 16/17; n = 2,335) and 2010/11 (aged 20/21; n = 2,087). Data were collected on substance use, family, schools, neighbourhoods, offending behaviour and mental health. The most novel aspect of the study was the collection of detailed social network data via friendship nominations allowing the investigation of the spread of substance use via friendship networks. In 2004 (school year 11; respondents aged 14), a sub-sample of participants’ parents (n = 1,097) and siblings (n = 211) also completed measures on substance use and family dynamics. Results The most recent wave (in 2010/2011; respondents aged 20/21 years) indicated lifetime use of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis among the cohort was 94, 70 and 45 per cent, respectively. The paper charts the development of drug use behaviour and some of the key results to date are presented. We have also identified a number of key areas ripe for analysis by interested researchers including sexual health and education. Conclusions We have established a cohort with detailed data from adolescence to young adulthood, supplemented with parent and sibling reports and peer network data. The dataset, allowing for investigation of trajectories of adolescent substance use, associated factors and subsequent long-term outcomes, constitutes an important resource for longitudinal substance misuse research. A planned further wave as the cohort enter their late twenties and potential to link to administrative data sources, will further enrich the datasets."

https://openalex.org/W2803334430,"Gelsolin (GSN) protein, expressed in circulating monocytes, was previously reported to be associated with osteoporosis in both Chinese and Caucasian women. This study aims to test if plasma GSN protein level is associated with hip bone mineral density (BMD) in Chinese population. Based on two study Groups containing 6,308 old Chinese, we adopted extreme sampling scheme and selected 3 independent samples (Subgroups 1-3) for discovery, replication, and validation purposes. We tested plasma GSN concentration, and analyzed whether plasma GSN level differs between subjects with extremely low vs. high hip BMD. In Group 1 (N = 1,860), the plasma GSN level increased in the female with low BMD, which was discovered in the Subgroup 1 (N = 42, p = 0.093) and replicated in the Subgroup 2 (N = 39, p = 0.095). With more extreme sampling for the Subgroup 3 from the Group 2 (N = 4,448), the difference of plasma GSN level in the female with low BMD vs. high BMD is more significant (N = 45, p = 0.037). After the subjects were pooled from Subgroups 2 and 3, the difference in plasma GSN between low and high BMD subjects became even more significant (p = 0.016). The plasma GSN level was negatively correlated with total hip BMD (r = -0.26, p = 0.033). We concluded that plasma GSN was associated with hip BMD in Chinese postmenopausal women and plasma GSN might be a potential risk biomarker for osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2803230161,"Locomotor systems are widely used to study rhythmically active neural networks. These networks have to be coordinated in order to produce meaningful behavior. The crayfish swimmeret system is well suited to investigate such coordination of distributed neural oscillators because the neurons and their connectivity for generating and especially for coordinating the motor output are identified. The system maintains a fixed phase lag between the segmental oscillators, independent of cycle period. To further the understanding of the system's plasticity for keeping the phase lag fixed, we profiled the neurotransmitters used by the Coordinating Neurons, which are necessary and sufficient for coordination of the segmental oscillators. We used a combination of electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, and mass spectrometric methods. This arrangement of methods ensured that we could screen for several specific neurotransmitters, since a single method is often not suitable for all neurotransmitters of interest. In a first step, to preselect neurotransmitter candidates, we investigated the effect of substances known to be present in some swimmeret system neurons on the motor output and coordination. Subsequently, we demonstrated electrophysiologically that the identified synapse between the Coordinating Neurons and their target is mainly chemical, but neither glutamate antagonist nor γ-aminobutyric acid antagonist application affected this synapse. With immunohistochemical experiments, we provide strong evidence that the Coordinating Neurons are not serotonergic. Single-cell MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry with subsequent principal component analysis identified acetylcholine as the putative neurotransmitter for both types of Coordinating Neurons."
