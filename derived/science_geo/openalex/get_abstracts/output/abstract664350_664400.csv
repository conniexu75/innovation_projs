https://openalex.org/W3107753234,"Background Louisiana in the summer of 2020 had the highest per capita case count for COVID-19 in the United States and COVID-19 deaths disproportionately affects the African American population. Neighborhood deprivation has been observed to be associated with poorer health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 in Louisiana. Methods The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) was calculated and used to classify neighborhood deprivation at the census tract level. A total of 17 US census variables were used to calculate the ADI for each of the 1148 census tracts in Louisiana. The data were extracted from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2018. The neighborhoods were categorized into quintiles as well as low and high deprivation. The publicly available COVID-19 cumulative case counts by census tract were obtained from the Louisiana Department of Health website on July 31, 2020. Descriptive and Poisson regression analyses were performed. Results Neighborhoods in Louisiana were substantially different with respect to deprivation. The ADI ranged from 136.00 for the most deprived neighborhood and –33.87 in the least deprived neighborhood. We observed that individuals residing in the most deprived neighborhoods had almost a 40% higher risk of COVID-19 compared to those residing in the least deprived neighborhoods. Conclusion While the majority of previous studies were focused on very limited socio-environmental factors such as crowding and income, this study used a composite area-based deprivation index to examine the role of neighborhood environment on COVID-19. We observed a positive relationship between neighborhood deprivation and COVID-19 risk in Louisiana. The study findings can be utilized to promote public health preventions measures besides social distancing, wearing a mask while in public and frequent handwashing in vulnerable neighborhoods with greater deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W3107917088,"The ever-increasing industrial activities over the decades have generated high toxic metal such as chromium (Cr) that hampers the crop productivity. This study evaluated the effect of Cr on two chickpea ( Cicer arietinum L.) varieties, Pusa 2085 and Pusa Green 112, in hydroponic and pot-grown conditions. First, growth parameters (seed germination, seedling growth, and biomass production) and physio-biochemical parameters (oxidative stress and the content of antioxidants and proline) were measured to evaluate the performance of both varieties grown hydroponically for 21 days at concentrations of 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 μM Cr in the form of potassium dichromate (K 2 Cr 2 O 7 ). In both varieties, significantly deleterious effects on germination and seedling growth parameters were observed at 90 and 120 μM, while growth was stimulated at 30 μM Cr. Significant increases in malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide content and electrolyte leakage demonstrated enhanced oxidative injury to seedlings caused by higher concentrations of Cr. Further, increasing concentrations of Cr positively correlated with increased proline content, superoxide dismutase activity, and peroxide content in leaves. There was also an increase in peroxisomal ascorbate peroxidase and catalase in the leaves of both varieties at lower Cr concentrations, whereas a steep decline was recorded at higher Cr concentrations. In the pot experiments conducted over two consecutive years, growth, yield, yield attributes, grain protein, and Cr uptake and accumulation were measured at different Cr concentrations. Pusa Green 112 showed a significant reduction in plant growth, chlorophyll content, grain protein, pod number, and grain yield per plant when compared with Pusa 2085. Overall, our results indicate that Pusa 2085 has a higher Cr tolerance than Pusa Green 112. Therefore, Pusa 2085 could be used to further elucidate the mechanisms of Cr tolerance in plants and in breeding programmes to produce Cr-resistant varieties."

Health care workers (HCWs) are a well-recognized risk group for COVID-19. The study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a nosocomial setting and assess potential risk factors. Methods HCWs from two hospitals participated in the study. Hospital-1 was a tertiary university affiliated center, involved in the care of COVID-19 patients while hospital-2 was a tertiary specialized cardiac surgery center not involved in the care of these patients. A validated, CE, rapid, IgM/IgG antibody point-of-care test was used. Comparative performance with a reference globally available assay was assessed. Results 1,495 individuals consented to participate (response rate 77%). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 weighted prevalence was 1.26% (95% CI 0.43, 3.26) overall and 0.53% (95% CI 0.06, 2.78) and 2.70% (95% CI 0.57, 9.19) in hospital-1 and hospital-2, respectively although the study was underpowered to detect statistically significant differences. The overall, hospital-1, and hospital-2 seroprevalence was 10, 4 and 22 times higher than the estimated infection attack rate in general population, respectively. Suboptimal use of personal protective equipment was noted in both hospitals. Conclusions These data have implications for the preparedness of a second wave of COVID-19 epidemic, given the low burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection rate, in concordance with national projections."
https://openalex.org/W3109271422,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacteria is a complex subject, why one need to look at this phenomenon from a wider and holistic perspective. The extensive use of the same antimicrobial classes in human and veterinary medicine as well as horticulture is one of the main drivers for the AMR selection. Here, we applied shotgun metagenomics to investigate the AMR epidemiology in several animal species including farm animals, which are often exposed to antimicrobial treatment opposed to an unique set of wild animals that seems not to be subjected to antimicrobial pressure. The comparison of the domestic and wild animals allowed to investigate the possible anthropogenic impact on AMR spread. Inclusion of animals with different feeding behaviors (carnivores, omnivores) enabled to further assess which AMR genes that thrives within the food chain. We tested fecal samples not only of intensively produced chickens, turkeys, and pigs, but also of wild animals such as wild boars, red foxes, and rodents. A multi-directional approach mapping obtained sequences to several databases provided insight into the occurrence of the different AMR genes. The method applied enabled also analysis of other factors that may influence AMR of intestinal microbiome such as diet. Our findings confirmed higher levels of AMR in farm animals than in wildlife. The results also revealed the potential of wildlife in the AMR dissemination. Particularly in red foxes, we found evidence of several AMR genes conferring resistance to critically important antimicrobials like quinolones and cephalosporins. In contrast, the lowest abundance of AMR was observed in rodents originating from natural environment with presumed limited exposure to antimicrobials. Shotgun metagenomics enabled us to demonstrate that discrepancies between AMR profiles found in the intestinal microbiome of various animals probably resulted from the different antimicrobial exposure, habitats, and behavior of the tested animal species."
https://openalex.org/W3109388426,"We study the experimentally measured ciprofloxacin antibiotic diffusion through a gel-like artificial sputum medium (ASM) mimicking physiological conditions typical for a cystic fibrosis layer, in which regions occupied by Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria are present. To quantify the antibiotic diffusion dynamics we employ a phenomenological model using a subdiffusion-absorption equation with a fractional time derivative. This effective equation describes molecular diffusion in a medium structured akin Thompson’s plumpudding model; here the ‘pudding’ background represents the ASM and the ‘plums’ represent the bacterial biofilm. The pudding is a subdiffusion barrier for antibiotic molecules that can affect bacteria found in plums. For the experimental study we use an interferometric method to determine the time evolution of the amount of antibiotic that has diffused through the biofilm. The theoretical model shows that this function is qualitatively different depending on whether or not absorption of the antibiotic in the biofilm occurs. We show that the process can be divided into three successive stages: (1) only antibiotic subdiffusion with constant biofilm parameters, (2) subdiffusion and absorption of antibiotic molecules with variable biofilm transport parameters, (3) subdiffusion and absorption in the medium but the biofilm parameters are constant again. Stage 2 is interpreted as the appearance of an intensive defence build–up of bacteria against the action of the antibiotic, and in the stage 3 it is likely that the bacteria have been inactivated. Times at which stages change are determined from the experimentally obtained temporal evolution of the amount of antibiotic that has diffused through the ASM with bacteria. Our analysis shows good agreement between experimental and theoretical results and is consistent with the biologically expected biofilm response. We show that an experimental method to study the temporal evolution of the amount of a substance that has diffused through a biofilm is useful in studying the processes occurring in a biofilm. We also show that the complicated biological process of antibiotic diffusion in a biofilm can be described by a fractional subdiffusion-absorption equation with subdiffusion and absorption parameters that change over time."
https://openalex.org/W3109117734,"PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) stimulation has been used for therapeutic purposes for over 50 years including in the treatment of memory loss, depression, alleviation of pain, bone and wound healing, and treatment of certain cancers. However, the underlying cellular mechanisms mediating these effects have remained poorly understood. In particular, because magnetic field pulses will induce electric currents in the stimulated tissue, it is unclear whether the observed effects are due to the magnetic or electric component of the stimulation. Recently, it has been shown that PEMFs stimulate the formation of ROS (reactive oxygen species) in human cell cultures by a mechanism that requires cryptochrome, a putative magnetosensor. Here we show by qPCR analysis of ROS-regulated gene expression that simply removing cell cultures from the Earth’s geomagnetic field by placing them in a Low-Level Field condition induces similar effects on ROS signaling as does exposure of cells to PEMF. This effect can be explained by the so-called Radical Pair mechanism, which provides a quantum physical means by which the rates and product yields (e.g. ROS) of biochemical redox reactions may be modulated by magnetic fields. Since transient cancelling of the Earth’s magnetic field can in principle be achieved by PEMF exposure, we propose that the therapeutic effects of PEMFs may be explained by the ensuing modulation of ROS synthesis. Our results could lead to significant improvements in the design and therapeutic applications of PEMF devices."

Service-oriented enterprises such as e-commerce transactions and information technology came into being. This paper analyzes the shortcomings and challenges of traditional online shopping behavior prediction methods, and proposes an online shopping behavior analysis and prediction system. The paper chooses linear model logistic regression and decision tree based XGBoost model. After optimizing the model, it is found that the nonlinear model can make better use of these features and get better prediction results. In this paper, we first combine the single model, and then use the model fusion algorithm to fuse the prediction results of the single model. The purpose is to avoid the accuracy of the linear model easy to fit and the decision tree model over-fitting. The results show that the model constructed by the article has further improvement than the single model. Finally, through two sets of contrast experiments, it is proved that the algorithm selected in this paper can effectively filter the features, which simplifies the complexity of the model to a certain extent and improves the classification accuracy of machine learning. The XGBoost hybrid model based on p/n samples is simpler than a single model. Machine learning models are not easily over-fitting and therefore more robust."
https://openalex.org/W3108107930,"Cola nitida known as Kola serves as flavouring ingredient in the food industry and is also of great importance during traditional rites in Africa. Despite the well-known pharmaceutical values of the species, efforts to develop improved varieties with enhanced nutraceutical quality is limited due to unavailability of information on variation of genotypes in bioactive compounds in the nuts. The objectives of this research were to evaluate 25 genotypes of kola for bioactive contents, determine relationship between nutritional and phenolic traits and to identify kola genotypes with good nutraceutical quality for use in developing improved varieties. The kola genotypes were established in the field using a randomized complete block design with three replicates. Nuts harvested from the blocks, were bulked and used to quantify soluble and insoluble sugars, total protein, moisture, ash, fats, pH, polyphenols, tannins and flavonoids using completely randomized design with three replicates in the laboratory. Data were analysed by combining Analysis of Variance, Kruskal-Wallis test, correlation test and multivariate analysis. Significant variations (P &lt; 0.05) were observed among the kola genotypes for the bioactive traits evaluated. Phenolic traits were more heritable than nutritional traits. Although not significant (P &gt; 0.05), correlation between nutritional and phenolic traits was negative, whereas correlations among nutritional traits were weak. On the contrary, significant and positive correlations (P &lt; 0.05) were observed among phenolic traits. The hierarchical clustering analysis based on the traits evaluated grouped the 25 genotypes of kola evaluated into four clusters. Genotypes A12, JB4, JB19, JB36, P2-1b, and P2-1c were identified as potential parental lines for phenolic traits selection in kola whereas genotypes A10, Club, Atta1 and JB10 can be considered for soluble and insoluble sugar-rich variety development. These findings represent an important step towards improving nutritional and nutraceutical quality of kola nuts."
https://openalex.org/W3108924173,"Background Accumulating evidence suggests that the built environment is associated with physical activity. The extent to which the built environment may support adherence to physical activity interventions is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the neighbourhood built environment constrains or facilitates adherence and steps taken during a 12-week internet-delivered pedometer-based physical activity intervention (UWALK). Method The study was undertaken in Calgary (Canada) between May 2016 and August 2017. Inactive adults (n = 573) completed a telephone survey measuring sociodemographic characteristics and perceived neighbourhood walkability. Following the survey, participants were mailed a pedometer and instructions for joining UWALK. Participants were asked to report their daily pedometer steps into the online program on a weekly basis for 12 weeks (84 days). Walk Score® estimated objective neighbourhood walkability and the Neighbourhood Environment Walkability Scale–Abbreviated (NEWS-A) measured participants self-reported neighbourhood walkability. Regression models estimated covariate-adjusted associations of objective and self-reported walkability with: 1) adherence to the UWALK intervention (count of days with steps reported and count of days with 10000 steps reported), and; 2) average daily pedometer steps. Results On average, participants undertook 8565 (SD = 3030) steps per day, reported steps on 67 (SD = 22.3) of the 84 days, and achieved ≥10000 steps on 22 (SD = 20.5) of the 84 days. Adjusting for covariates, a one-unit increase in self-reported walkability was associated on average with 45.76 (95CI 14.91, 76.61) more daily pedometer steps. Walk Score® was not significantly associated with steps. Neither objective nor self-reported walkability were significantly associated with the UWALK adherence outcomes. Conclusion The neighbourhood built environment may support pedometer-measured physical activity but may not influence adherence to pedometer interventions. Perceived walkability may be more important than objectively-measured walkability in supporting physical activity during pedometer interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3109814423,"Background Prelacteal feeding (PLF) is a recognised challenge to optimal breastfeeding but remains common in Indonesia. Meanwhile, PLF-related epidemiological research is limited, particularly in this setting. This study examines the prevalence and determinants of overall PLF as well as common PLF types (formula, other milk, and honey) in Indonesia. Methods Data from 6127 mothers whose last child was ≤23-month-old were drawn from the 2017 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey. Multivariable modified Poisson regression was used to measure the prevalence ratio (PR) for selected PLF risk factors. PLF was defined as anything to drink other than breast milk within three days after birth, before breastmilk flows. Additional analyses were performed on mothers who gave formula, other milk, and honey. Results About 45% babies in Indonesia received PLF with formula being the most frequent (25%), followed by other milk (14%), plain water (5%), and honey (3%). Factors associated with higher prevalence of any PLF were higher wealth quintiles in rural area (PR 1.07; 95% CI 1.03–1.11 per increase in quintile), baby perceived to be small at birth (PR 1.23; 95% CI 1.12–1.35), caesarean deliveries at either public (PR 1.27; 95% CI 1.13–1.44) or private facilities (PR 1.15; 95% CI 1.01–1.31), and not having immediate skin-to-skin contact after birth (PR 1.32; 95% CI 1.23–1.42). PLF was less prevalent among mothers who gave birth to second/subsequent child (PR 0.82; 95% CI 0.76–0.88) and who had an antenatal card (PR 0.89; 95% CI 0.80–0.99). These patterns did not apply uniformly across all PLF types. For example, honey was more common among home births than deliveries at health facilities, but formula and other milk were more common among caesarean deliveries. Conclusions Mapping risk factors for PLF, especially by types, could help to design more targeted interventions to reduce PLF and improve breastfeeding practices in Indonesia."
https://openalex.org/W3106822148,"The interpretation of medical images is an error-prone process that may yield severe consequences for patients. In dental medicine panoramic radiography (OPT) is a frequently used diagnostic procedure. OPTs typically contain multiple, diverse anomalies within one image making the diagnostic process very demanding, rendering students’ development of visual expertise a complex task. Radiograph interpretation is typically taught through massed practice; however, it is not known how effective this approach is nor how it changes students’ visual inspection of radiographs. Therefore, this study investigated how massed practice–an instructional method that entails massed learning of one type of material–affects processing of OPTs and the development of diagnostic performance. From 2017 to 2018, 47 dental students in their first clinical semester diagnosed 10 OPTs before and after their regular massed practice training, which is embedded in their curriculum. The OPTs contained between 3 to 26 to-be-identified anomalies. During massed practice they diagnosed 100 dental radiographs without receiving corrective feedback. The authors recorded students’ eye movements and assessed the number of correctly identified and falsely marked low- and high prevalence anomalies before and after massed practice. Massed practice had a positive effect on detecting anomalies especially with low prevalence ( p &lt; .001). After massed practice students covered a larger proportion of the OPTs ( p &lt; .001), which was positively related to the detection of low-prevalence anomalies ( p = .04). Students also focused longer, more frequently, and earlier on low-prevalence anomalies after massed practice ( p s &lt; .001). While massed practice improved visual expertise in dental students with limited prior knowledge, there is still substantial room for improvement. The results suggest integrating massed practice with more deliberate practice, where, for example, corrective feedback is provided, and support is adapted to students’ needs."

Without the authorization of copyright holders, this shadow library hosts and makes more than 2 million scholarly publications, monographs, and textbooks available. This paper analyzes a set of weblogs of one of the Library Genesis mirrors, provided to us by one of the service’s administrators. We reconstruct the social and economic factors that drive the global and European demand for illicit scholarly literature. In particular, we test if lower income regions can compensate for the shortcomings in legal access infrastructures by more intensive use of illicit open resources. We found that while richer regions are the most intensive users of shadow libraries, poorer regions face structural limitations that prevent them from fully capitalizing on freely accessible knowledge. We discuss these findings in the wider context of open access publishing, and point out that open access knowledge, if not met with proper knowledge absorption infrastructures, has limited usefulness in addressing knowledge access and production inequalities."
https://openalex.org/W3108269048,"Background Between 1990 and 2017, Nepal experienced a shift in the burden of disease from communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional (CMNN) diseases to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). With an increasing ageing population and life-style changes including tobacco use, harmful alcohol consumption, unhealthy diets, and insufficient physical activity, the proportion of total deaths from NCDs will continue to increase. An analysis of current diseases pattern and projections of the trends informs planning of health interventions. This analysis aims to project the mortality and risk factor of disease until 2040, based on past trends. Methods This study uses secondary data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study which analyses historic data from 1990 to 2016 to predict key variables such as, the mortality rates, life expectancy and Years of Life Lost for different causes of death from 2017 to 2040. ‘GBD Foresight Visualization’, a visualisation tool publicly available in the webpage of Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation was the source of data for this analysis. GBD forecasting uses three-component modelling process: the first component captures variations due to risk factors and interventions, the second takes into consideration the variation due to measures of development quantified as social development index and the third uses an autoregressive integrated moving average model to capture the unexplained component correlated over time. We extracted Nepal specific data from it and reported number of deaths, mortality rates (per 100,000 population) as well as causes of death for the period 1990 to 2040. Results In 1990, CMNN diseases were responsible for approximately two-thirds (63.6%) of total deaths in Nepal. The proportion of the deaths from the CMNN diseases has reduced to 26.8% in 2015 and is estimated to be about a fifth of the 1990 figure (12.47%) in 2040. Conversely, deaths from NCDs reflect an upward trend. NCDs claimed a third of total deaths (29.91%) in the country in 1990, while in 2015, were responsible for about two-thirds of the total deaths (63.31%). In 2040, it is predicted that NCDs will contribute to over two-thirds (78.64%) of total deaths in the country. Less than a tenth (6.49%) of the total deaths in Nepal in 1990 were associated with injuries which increased to 13.04% in 2015 but is projected to decrease to 8.89% in 2040. In 1990, metabolic risk factors including high systolic blood pressure, high total cholesterol, high fasting plasma glucose, high body mass index and impaired kidney functions collectively contributed to a tenth of the total deaths (10.38%) in Nepal, whereas, in 2040 more than a third (37.31%) of the total deaths in the country could be attributed to it. Conclusion A reverse of the situation in 1990, NCDs are predicted to be the leading cause of deaths and metabolic risk factors are predicted to contribute to the highest proportion of deaths in 2040. NCDs could demand a major share of resources within the health sector requiring extensive multi-sectoral prevention measures, re-allocation of resources and re-organisation of the health system to cater for long-term care."
https://openalex.org/W3108466991,"Environmental protection regulations adopted by governments affect the microeconomic behavior of enterprises. The Chinese government began piloting the outgoing leading officials’ accountability audit of natural resources assets (OANRA) in some regions in 2014. Based on this quasi-natural experimental setting, this paper chose heavy-polluting and resource-based enterprises in pilot regions of China from 2011 to 2016 as examples for studying the impact of the OANRA on enterprise innovation and further examines the role of government subsidies in this process. The study finds that the OANRA has no significant impact on enterprise innovation. However, with support from government subsidies, the OANRA dramatically accelerates enterprise innovation investment. The results are still seen after applying propensity matching analysis (PSM), balancing panel data and deleting special provinces. Further analysis shows that this effect is more obvious among small-scale, state-owned enterprises that are located in areas with high degrees of marketization and high bank credit constraints. This study advances the research of the OANRA’s effects on the microeconomic behavior of enterprises. Moreover, the adjustment effect of government subsidies also provides great reference value to making rational use of policy to cooperate with the OANRA."

This is a Hidden Markov Model whose hidden layer is a regeneration process with Poisson immigration, Po-INAR(1), together with a mechanism that allows the estimation of the under-reporting in non-stationary count time series. A novelty of the model is that the expectation of the unobserved process’s innovations is a time-dependent function defined in such a way that information about the spread of an epidemic, as modelled through a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed dynamical system, is incorporated into the model. In addition, the parameter controlling the intensity of the under-reporting is also made to vary with time to adjust to possible seasonality or trend in the data. Maximum likelihood methods are used to estimate the parameters of the model."
https://openalex.org/W3108848017,"We have reported previously that renal hemodynamic abnormalities exist in the prediabetic stage of type II diabetic rats. At this prediabetic stage these rats have hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. It is well known that insulin resistance is frequently associated with renal abnormalities, but the mechanism underlying this association has remained speculative. Although insulin is known to modify renal hemodynamics, little is known about the roles of insulin receptor substrates (IRS1, IRS2) in the renal actions of insulin. To address this issue, the effects of insulin on renal function and renal hemodynamics were investigated in C57BL/6 (WT: wild type), insulin receptor substrate 1- knockout ( IRS1–/– ), and IRS2-knockout ( IRS2–/– ) mice. IRS2–/–mice had elevated glucose level as expected. 24-h urine collections and serum creatinine revealed that creatinine clearance did not significantly differ between these groups. Albuminuria was found in IRS1–/– and IRS2–/– groups. We examined the effects on the IRS during the administration of Losartan, which is widely used for diabetic nephropathy. After the administration of Losartan the IRS displayed improved renal hemodynamics. Moreover, the subjects were also given Pioglitazone, which improves insulin resistance. Losartan significantly reduced albuminuria in both groups. Pioglitazone also showed similar results. We assessed the autoregulatory responses of the total renal blood flow (RBF), the superficial (SBF) and the deep renal cortical blood flow (DBF) with stepwise reductions of renal perfusion pressure (RPP), which was induced by a manual clamp on the abdominal aorta. During the clamp induced reductions of the RPP by 10 to 20mm HG, RBF, SBF and the DBF fell significantly more in the IRS1 and IRS2 than in the WT mice. Furthermore micropuncture studies showded that compared to the WT tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) responses of the stop flow pressure (P sf ) were reduced in both the IRS1 -/- and IRS2 -/- . The results of the IRS1 and IRS2 mice displayed the pressence of hemodynamic abnormalities. Losartan and Pioglitazone have shown the potential to improve these abnormalities. In conclusion the results indicate that IRS plays a major role in the stimulation of renal functions and renal hemodynamics in type type II diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3110441896,"Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a hematopoietic cell-specific Ste20-related serine/threonine kinase, is a negative regulator of signal transduction in immune cells, including T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). In mice, HPK1 deficiency subverts inhibition of the anti-tumor immune response and is associated with functional augmentation of anti-tumor T cells. We have used a potent, small molecule HPK1 inhibitor, Compound 1, to investigate the effects of pharmacological intervention of HPK1 kinase activity in immune cells. Compound 1 enhanced Th1 cytokine production in T cells and fully reverted immune suppression imposed by the prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) and adenosine pathways in human T cells. Moreover, the combination of Compound 1 with pembrolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), demonstrated a synergistic effect, resulting in enhanced interferon (IFN)-γ production. Collectively, our results suggest that blocking HPK1 kinase activity with small molecule inhibitors alone or in combination with checkpoint blockade may be an attractive approach for the immunotherapy of cancer."

It is thought that light to moderate alcohol consumption has a beneficial effect on vascular function in women. We measured flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in 702 women aged 17–86 years who provided information on alcohol consumption. We divided the subjects into four groups: non-drinkers (0 g/week), light drinkers (&gt;0 to 140 g/week), moderate drinkers (&gt;140 to 280 g/week) and heavy drinkers (&gt;280 g/week). There was no significant difference in FMD among the four groups. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that alcohol consumption in non-drinkers and light drinkers was not an independent predictor of FMD (β = −0.001, P = 0.98). We compared 50 moderate drinkers and 50 non-drinkers matched for age and medical histories and 22 heavy drinkers and 22 non-drinkers in matched pair analysis. There was no significant difference in FMD between moderate drinkers and non-drinkers (8.2±4.3% vs. 8.1±3.5, P = 0.91), while FMD in heavy drinkers was significantly lower than that in non-drinkers (5.9±2.5% vs. 8.9±3.5%, P = 0.002). These findings suggest that heavy alcohol consumption is associated with endothelial dysfunction but that light to moderate alcohol consumption is not associated with endothelial dysfunction in women.

https://openalex.org/W3108526048,"Background High-intensity functional training (HIFT) has become more popular, and the number of practitioners has increased; however, it remains unclear whether perturbations in the immune parameters occur, even after one single bout. Our aim was to examine acute leucocyte, muscle damage, and stress marker responses following a single ‘Cindy’ workout session, and compare the results between novice and experienced participants. Material and methods Twenty-three HIFT practitioners (age 31.0 ± 1.0 years) completed the ‘Cindy’ workout. They were categorized as novice (3–8 months of experience; n = 10) and experienced (≥18 months; n = 13). White blood cell (WBC) count, plasma creatine kinase (CK) activity, blood cortisol level, and lactate concentration were measured. Blood analysis was performed before (pre-ex), immediately after (post-ex), 30 min after (post-30 min), and 24 h after (post-24 h) a single ‘Cindy’ workout session. Results WBC count was higher post-ex (6.8 to 11.8x10 3 /μL) and returned to baseline values within post-30 min (p&lt;0.01). Neutrophil (3.3 to 4.5x10 3 /μL) and lymphocyte levels (2.8 to 5.9x10 3 /μL) were higher post-ex and returned to baseline values after post-24 h, yet lymphocytopoenia (2.2x10 3 /μL) was observed at post-30 min (p&lt;0.01). CK increased post-ex (174.9 to 226.7 U.L -1 ) and remained elevated post-24 h. Cortisol (14.7 to 17.0 μg/dL) and lactate (1.9 to 13.5 mmol.l -1 ) responses increased post-ex, but only the lactate level was reduced at post-30 min (p&lt;0.01). The experienced participants had higher WBC, lymphocyte, and cortisol concentrations post-ex than the novice ones (p&lt;0.01). Conclusions A single HIFT session elicited significant acute perturbations in WBC count, stress markers, and muscle tissue, which is like other similar regimens. Importantly, the experienced participants showed greater lymphocyte and cortisol responses than the novice ones."
https://openalex.org/W3108125734,"Coronaviruses and influenza viruses have similarities and differences. In order to comprehensively compare them, their genome sequencing data were examined by principal component analysis. Coronaviruses had fewer variations than a subclass of influenza viruses. In addition, differences among coronaviruses that infect a variety of hosts were also small. These characteristics may have facilitated the infection of different hosts. Although many of the coronaviruses were conservative, those repeatedly found among humans showed annual changes. If SARS-CoV-2 changes its genome like the Influenza H type, it will repeatedly spread every few years. In addition, the coronavirus family has many other candidates for new pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W3108204856,"India has one of the largest agricultural input support programs in the world, delivered in the form of subsidies to farmers, raising concerns about its sustainability. This paper evaluates the performance of one such support, the micronutrient subsidy program in the state of Andhra Pradesh (AP) and presents a case for providing this support in the form of direct cash transfers. Under the program, key soil micronutrients- zinc, boron, and gypsum were distributed free of cost to farmers living in micronutrient-deficient areas, with identification and targeting managed entirely by the state. We survey 1621 farmers, 61 agriculture extension officers, and 78 agriculture input dealers to assess the efficacy of the program and to identify bottlenecks preventing effective targeting, with a focus on zinc. We find that use of non-subsidized zinc is high in AP, and awareness of benefits of zinc and physical access to input dealer shops are significant predictors of zinc use. We argue that the free provision of micronutrients may have created demand among farmers, but there is little justification to continue subsidizing such a program at such high rates or resorting to public distribution. We find that micronutrient procurement and distribution has become a burden on extension staff and crowds out the private sector. Our analysis shows that the subsidy can benefit more farmers if it is channeled through the network of private fertilizer dealers. We use administrative data on budgetary outlays and digital soil maps to suggest fiscal redistribution in the form of direct cash transfers that may ensure more effective targeting at a lower cost to the state."
https://openalex.org/W3109798523,"Most complex network analyses of transportation systems use simplified static representations obtained from existing connections in a time horizon. In static representations, travel times, waiting times and compatibility of schedules are neglected, thus losing relevant information. To obtain a more accurate description of transportation networks, we use a dynamic representation that considers synced paths and that includes waiting times to compute shortest paths. We use the shortest paths to define dynamic network, node and edge measures to analyse the topology of transportation networks, comparable with measures obtained from static representations. We illustrate the application of these measures with a toy model and a real transportation network built from schedules of a low-cost carrier. Results show remarkable differences between measures of static and dynamic representations, demonstrating the limitations of the static representation to obtain accurate information of transportation networks."
https://openalex.org/W3108010755,"Lockdown and social distancing measures have been implemented for many countries to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent overwhelming of health services. However, success on this strategy depends not only on the timing of its implementation, but also on the relaxation measures adopted within each community. We developed a mathematical model to evaluate the impacts of the lockdown implemented in Hermosillo, Mexico. We compared this intervention with some hypothetical ones, varying the starting date and also the population proportion that is released, breaking the confinement. A Monte Carlo study was performed by considering three scenarios to define our baseline dynamics. Results showed that a hypothetical delay of two weeks, on the lockdown measures, would result in an early acme around May 9 for hospitalization prevalence and an increase on cumulative deaths, 42 times higher by May 31, when compared to baseline. On the other hand, results concerning relaxation dynamics showed that the acme levels depend on the proportion of people who gets back to daily activities as well as the individual behavior with respect to prevention measures. Analysis regarding different relaxing mitigation measures were provided to the Sonoran Health Ministry, as requested. It is important to stress that, according to information provided by health authorities, the acme occurring time was closed to the one given by our model. Hence, we considered that our model resulted useful for the decision-making assessment, and that an extension of it can be used for the study of a potential second wave."
https://openalex.org/W3108220376,"Recent evidence suggests that reward prediction errors (RPEs) play an important role in declarative learning, but its neurophysiological mechanism remains unclear. Here, we tested the hypothesis that RPEs modulate declarative learning via theta-frequency oscillations, which have been related to memory encoding in prior work. For that purpose, we examined the interaction between RPE and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) in declarative learning. Using a between-subject (real versus sham stimulation group), single-blind stimulation design, 76 participants learned 60 Dutch-Swahili word pairs, while theta-frequency (6 Hz) tACS was administered over the medial frontal cortex (MFC). Previous studies have implicated MFC in memory encoding. We replicated our previous finding of signed RPEs (SRPEs) boosting declarative learning; with larger and more positive RPEs enhancing memory performance. However, tACS failed to modulate the SRPE effect in declarative learning and did not affect memory performance. Bayesian statistics supported evidence for an absence of effect. Our study confirms a role of RPE in declarative learning, but also calls for standardized procedures in transcranial electrical stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W3109148624,"Introduction The rate of cesarean delivery (C-section) has been increasing worldwide, including Bangladesh, and it has a negative impact on the mother and child's health. Our aim was to examine the association between C-section and childhood diseases and to identify the key factors associated with childhood diseases. Methods We used four nationally representative data sets from multiple indicator cluster survey (MICS, 2012 and 2019) and Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS, 2011and 2014) and analyzed 25,270 mother-child pairs. We used the frequency of common childhood diseases (fever, short or rapid breaths, cough, blood in stools, and diarrhea) as our outcome variable and C-section as exposure variable. We included mother’s age, place of residence, division, mother’s education, wealth index, child age, child sex, and child size at birth as confounding variables. Negative binomial regression model was used to analyze the data. Results In the BDHS data, the prevalence of C-section increased from 17.95% in 2011 to 23.33% in 2014. Also, in MICS, the prevalence almost doubled over an eight-year period (17.74% in 2012 to 35.41% in 2019). We did not observe any significant effect of C-section on childhood diseases in both surveys. Only in 2014 BDHS, we found that C-section increases the risk of childhood disease by 5% [Risk Ratio (RR): 1.05, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.17, p = 0.33]. However, the risk of childhood disease differed significantly in all survey years by division, child's age, and child’s size at birth after adjusting for important confounding variables. For example, children living in Chittagong division had a higher risk [(2011 BDHS RR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.38) and (2019 MICS RR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.35)] of having disease compared to Dhaka division. Maternal age, education, and wealth status showed significant differences with the outcome in some survey years. Conclusion Our study shows that C-section in Bangladesh continued to increase over time, and we did not find significant association between C-section and early childhood diseases. High C-section rate has a greater impact on maternal and child health as well as the burden on the health care system. We recommend raising public awareness of the negative impact of unnecessary C-section in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3107028284,"Establishing a natural communication interface between the user and the terminal device is one of the central challenges of hand neuroprosthetics research. Surface electromyography (EMG) is the most common source of neural signals for interpreting a user’s intent in these interfaces. However, how the capacity of EMG generation is affected by various clinical parameters remains largely unknown. In this study, we examined the EMG activity of forearm muscles recorded from 11 transradially amputated subjects who performed a wide range of movements. EMG recordings from 40 able-bodied subjects were also analyzed to provide comparative benchmarks. By using non-negative matrix factorization, we extracted the synergistic EMG patterns for each subject to estimate the dimensionality of muscle control, under the framework of motor synergies. We found that amputees exhibited less than four synergies (with substantial variability related to the length of remaining limb and age), whereas able-bodied subjects commonly demonstrate five or more synergies. The results of this study provide novel insight into the muscle synergy framework and the design of natural myoelectric control interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W3107422823,"Background/Aims Smartphone use has become an indispensable part of our daily life. The handy design and powerful processor allow smartphone users to perform diversified tasks even when walking. This study aimed to investigate and compare the optical aftereffect and vergence adaptation of using a smartphone while walking and sitting. Methods Twenty-nine young healthy adults (aged 19 to 24 years old) with normal binocular and accommodative functions were recruited. Participants were asked to watch a movie for 30 minutes using a smartphone while either walking on a treadmill or sitting on a chair. Corneal aberrations and near heterophoria were measured before and after smartphone use by a corneal topographer and modified Thorington heterophoria test, respectively. Results Using the smartphone while walking induced a change in corneal H/V astigmatism, becoming 0.11±0.03 μm less negative (two-way ANOVA repeated measures, Bonferroni post-hoc test, p = 0.001). This optical aftereffect was significantly higher than after smartphone use while sitting by 0.10±0.03 μm (paired t-test, p = 0.003). Although smartphone use did not result in a significant change in near heterophoria (Bonferroni post-hoc test, p &gt; 0.15), the vergence adaptation showed relatively more eso- or less exo-deviation by 0.79±0.36 Δ in the walking than the sitting condition (paired t-test, p = 0.037). Conclusions Eyecare practitioners should be cautious of the potential optical after effect and vergence adaptation after prolonged smartphone usage."
https://openalex.org/W3108379482,"Țaga cheese is a traditional Romanian smear-ripened cheese made from bovine milk and identified with the name of the village and caves where it is produced. As no previously reported microbiological and chemical studies have been undertaken on this product, this research aimed to investigate the microbiological and biochemical characteristics which ensure the uniqueness of Țaga cheese during the ripening process, to inform producers as to key quality determinants. Cheese samples, consisting of retail blocks, were collected on days 2, 5, 12, 18, and 25 of the ripening process. The evolution of lactic microbiota during the production and maturation of traditional cheeses involves isolating lactic acid microorganisms present in cheese. Cheese samples were analyzed for pH, fat, NaCl, fatty acids, and volatile compounds. The microbial ecosystem naturally changes during the maturation process, leading to variation in the microorganisms involved during ripening. Our results show that specific bacteria were identified in high levels during the entire ripening process and may be responsible for milk fat lipolysis contributing directly to cheese flavor by imparting detailed fatty acid flavor notes, or indirectly as precursors formation of other flavor compounds."
https://openalex.org/W3108438712,"Background The aim of this study was to assess different amyloid beta subspecies’ effects on behaviour and cognition in mice and their interaction with isoflurane anaesthesia. Methods After governmental approval, cannulas were implanted in the lateral cerebral ventricle. After 14 days the mice were randomly intracerebroventricularly injected with Aβ 1–40 (Aβ40), Aβ 1–42 (Aβ42), 3NTyr10-Aβ (Aβ nitro), AβpE3-42 (Aβ pyro), or phosphate buffered saline. Four days after the injection, 30 mice (6 animals per subgroup) underwent general anaesthesia with isoflurane. A “sham” anaesthetic procedure was performed in another 30 mice (6 animals per subgroup, 10 subgroups in total). During the next eight consecutive days a blinded assessor evaluated behavioural and cognitive performance using the modified hole-board test. Following the testing we investigated 2 brains per subgroup for insoluble amyloid deposits using methoxy staining. We used western blotting in 4 brains per subgroup for analysis of tumour-necrosis factor alpha, caspase 3, glutamate receptors NR2B, and mGlu5. Data were analysed using general linear modelling and analysis of variance. Results Aβ pyro improved overall cognitive performance (p = 0.038). This cognitive improvement was reversed by isoflurane anaesthesia (p = 0.007), presumably mediated by decreased exploratory behaviour (p = 0.022 and p = 0.037). Injection of Aβ42 was associated with increased anxiety (p = 0.079). Explorative analysis on a limited number of brains did not reveal insoluble amyloid deposits or differences in the expression of tumour-necrosis factor alpha, NR2B, mGlu5, or caspase 3. Conclusions Testing cognitive performance after intracerebroventricular injection of different amyloid beta subspecies revealed that Aβ pyro might be less harmful, which was reversed by isoflurane anaesthesia. There is minor evidence for Aβ42-mediated neurotoxicity. Preliminary molecular analysis of biomarkers did not clarify pathophysiological mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3107460112,"Background Implementation of a point of care ultrasound curricula is valuable, but optimal integration for internal medicine residency is unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a structured ultrasound curriculum vs. structured ultrasound curriculum plus supervised thoracic ultrasounds would improve internal medicine residents’ skill and retention 6 and 12 months from baseline. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled study evaluating internal medical residents’ skill retention of thoracic ultrasound using a structured curriculum (control, n = 14) vs. structured curriculum plus 20 supervised bedside thoracic ultrasounds (intervention, n = 14). We used a stratified randomization based on program year. All subjects attended a half-day course that included 5 lectures and hands-on sessions at baseline. Assessments included written and practical exams at baseline, immediately post-course and at 6 and 12 months. Scores are reported as a percentage for the number of correct responses/number of questions (range 0–100%). The Mann Whitney U and the Friedman tests were used for analyses. Results Twenty-eight residents were enrolled. Two subjects withdrew prior to the 6-month exams. Written exam scores for all subjects improved, baseline median (IQR) 60 (46.47 to 66.67) post-course 80 (65 to 86.67), 6-month 80 (66.67 to 86.67) and 12-month 86.67 (80 to 88.34), p = &lt;0.001. All subjects practical exam scores median (IQR) significantly improved, baseline 18.18 (7.95 to 32.95), post-course 59.09 (45.45 to 70.45), 6 month 71.74 (60.87 to 82.61) and 12-month 76.09 (65.22 to 88.05), p = &lt;0.001. Comparing the control group to the intervention group, there were statistically significant higher scores, median (IQR), in the intervention group on the practical exam at 6 months 63.05 (48.92 to 69.57) vs. 82.61(72.83 to89.13), p = &lt;0.001. Conclusion In this cohort, internal medicine residents participating in a structured thoracic ultrasound course plus 20-supervised ultrasounds achieved higher practical exam scores long-term compared to controls."
https://openalex.org/W3107600132,"This article proposes and studies a new three-parameter generalized model of the inverse Gompertz distribution, in the so-called Kumaraswamy inverse Gompertz distribution. The main advantage of the new model is that it has ""an upside down bathtub-shaped curve hazard rate function"" depending upon the shape parameters. Several of its statistical and mathematical properties including quantiles, median, mode, moments, probability weighted moment, entropy function, skewness and kurtosis are derived. Moreover, the reliability and hazard rate functions, mean time to failure, mean residual and inactive lifetimes are also concluded. The maximum likelihood approach is done here to estimate the new model parameters. A simulation study is conducted to examine the performance of the estimators of this model. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed distribution is illustrated with different engineering applications to complete, type-II right censored, and upper record data and it is found that this model is more flexible when it is compared to well-known models in the statistical literature."
https://openalex.org/W3107888082,"Understanding social organization is fundamental for the analysis of animal societies. In this study, animal single-file movement data—serialized order movements generated by simple bottom-up rules of collective movements—are informative and effective observations for the reconstruction of animal social structures using agent-based models. For simulation, artificial 2-dimensional spatial distributions were prepared with the simple assumption of clustered structures of a group. Animals in the group are either independent or dependent agents. Independent agents distribute spatially independently each one another, while dependent agents distribute depending on the distribution of independent agents. Artificial agent spatial distributions aim to represent clustered structures of agent locations—a coupling of “core” or “keystone” subjects and “subordinate” or “follower” subjects. Collective movements were simulated following two simple rules, 1) initiators of the movement are randomly chosen, and 2) the next moving agent is always the nearest neighbor of the last moving agents, generating “single-file movement” data. Finally, social networks were visualized, and clustered structures reconstructed using a recent major social network analysis (SNA) algorithm, the Louvain algorithm, for rapid unfolding of communities in large networks. Simulations revealed possible reconstruction of clustered social structures using relatively minor observations of single-file movement, suggesting possible application of single-file movement observations for SNA use in field investigations of wild animals."
https://openalex.org/W3108818032,"A parental selection approach based on genomic prediction has been developed to help plant breeders identify a set of superior parental lines from a candidate population before conducting field trials. A classical parental selection approach based on genomic prediction usually involves truncation selection, i.e., selecting the top fraction of accessions on the basis of their genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs). However, truncation selection inevitably results in the loss of genomic diversity during the breeding process. To preserve genomic diversity, the selection of closely related accessions should be avoided during parental selection. We thus propose a new index to quantify the genomic diversity for a set of candidate accessions, and analyze two real rice ( Oryza sativa L.) genome datasets to compare several selection strategies. Our results showed that the pure truncation selection strategy produced the best starting breeding value but the least genomic diversity in the base population, leading to less genetic gain. On the other hand, strategies that considered only genomic diversity resulted in greater genomic diversity but less favorable starting breeding values, leading to more genetic gain but unsatisfactorily performing recombination inbred lines (RILs) in progeny populations. Among all strategies investigated in this study, compromised strategies, which considered both GEBVs and genomic diversity, produced the best or second-best performing RILs mainly because these strategies balance the starting breeding value with the maintenance of genomic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W3108967198,"Skipping meals is a poor eating behaviour known to result in poor diet quality and health outcomes. Nevertheless, it has become increasingly common over the past few decades in many countries. This study aimed to examine the potential association between the use of workplace foodservices and skipping meals among Korean adult workers using data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2016–2018, a nationwide cross-sectional survey of a representative Korean population. A total of 5,137 workers aged 20–64 years were included. Dietary assessment was conducted using a 24-hour dietary recall. In total, 41.2% participants skipped one meal or more per day. The percentage of workers who skipped meals was 43.1±1.0% among participants who did not use workplace foodservices compared to 31.8±1.9% among those who did (P&lt;0.01). Skipping meals was significantly associated with not using workplace foodservices, after adjusting for other confounders including sociodemographic variables, health-related variables, and meal procurement source (odds ratio = 3.4; 95% confidence interval = 2.6–4.4; P&lt;0.01). We found a significant association between using workplace foodservices and reduced skipping meals in Korean adult workers. This study suggests the importance of the provision of workplace foodservices for workers to potentially reduce poor eating behaviours such as skipping meals."
https://openalex.org/W3109121641,"The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) are still unclear. Endothelial cell (EC) remodeling is believed to contribute to this pulmonary disease triggered by thrombus and hemodynamic forces disbalance. Recently, we showed that HSP70 levels decrease by proatherogenic shear stress. Molecular chaperones play a major role in proteostasis in neurological, cancer and inflammatory/ infectious diseases. To shed light on microvascular responses in CTEPH, we characterized the expression of molecular chaperones and annexin A2, a component of the fibrinolytic system. There is no animal model that reproduces microvascular changes in CTEPH, and this fact led us to isolated endothelial cells from patients with CTEPH undergoing pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA). We exposed CTEPH-EC and control human pulmonary endothelial cells (HPAEC) to high- (15 dynes/cm 2 ) or low- (5 dynes/cm 2 ) shear stress. After high-magnitude shear stress HPAEC upregulated heat shock protein 70kDa (HSP70) and the HSP ER paralogs 78 and 94kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78 and 94), whereas CTEPH-ECs failed to exhibit this response. At static conditions, both HSP70 and HSP90 families in CTEPH-EC are decreased. Importantly, immunohistochemistry analysis showed that HSP70 expression was downregulated in vivo, and annexin A2 was upregulated. Interestingly, wound healing and angiogenesis assays revealed that HSP70 inhibition with VER-155008 further impaired CTEPH-EC migratory responses. These results implicate HSP70 as a novel master regulator of endothelial dysfunction in type 4 PH. Overall, we first show that global failure of HSP upregulation is a hallmark of CTEPH pathogenesis and propose HSP70 as a potential biomarker of this condition."
https://openalex.org/W3109670318,"Genetic diversity and maternal ancestry line relationships amongst a sample of 96 Cleveland Bay horses were investigated using a 479bp length of mitochondrial D-loop sequence. The analysis yielded at total of 11 haplotypes with 27 variable positions, all of which have been described in previous equine mitochondrial DNA d-loop studies. Four main haplotype clusters were present in the Cleveland Bay breed describing 89% of the total sample. This suggests that only four principal maternal ancestry lines exist in the present-day global Cleveland Bay population. Comparison of these sequences with other domestic horse haplotypes (Fig 2) shows a close association of the Cleveland Bay horse with Northern European (Clade C), Iberian (Clade A) and North African (Clade B) horse breeds. This indicates that the Cleveland Bay horse may not have evolved exclusively from the now extinct Chapman horse, as previous work as suggested. The Cleveland Bay horse remains one of only five domestic horse breeds classified as Critical on the Rare Breeds Survival Trust (UK) Watchlist and our results provide important information on the origins of this breed and represent a valuable tool for conservation purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3107302941,"The maintenance of buildings has become an important issue with the construction of many high-rise buildings in recent years. However, the cleaning of the outer walls of buildings is performed in highly hazardous environments over long periods, and many accidents occur each year. Various robots are being studied and developed to reduce these incidents and to relieve workers from hazardous tasks. Herein, we propose a method of spraying high-pressure water using a pump and nozzle, which differs from conventional methods. The cleaning performance parameters, such as water pressure, spray angle, and spray distance, were optimized using the Taguchi method. Cleaning experiments were performed on window specimens that were contaminated artificially. The cleaning performance of the proposed method was evaluated using the image-evaluation method. The optimum condition was determined based on the results of a sensitive analysis performed on the image data. In addition, the reaction force due to high pressure and impact force on the specimens were investigated. These forces were not sufficient to affect the propeller thrust or cause damage to the building’s surface. We expect to perform field tests in the near future based on the output of this research."
https://openalex.org/W3107928787,"Background Mexico is still in the growing phase of the epidemic of coronary heart disease (CHD), with mortality increasing by 48% since 1980. However, no studies have analyzed the drivers of these trends. We aimed to model CHD deaths between 2000 and 2012 in Mexico and to quantify the proportion of the mortality change attributable to advances in medical treatments and to changes in population-wide cardiovascular risk factors. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis using the previously validated IMPACT model to explain observed changes in CHD mortality in Mexican adults. The model integrates nationwide data at two-time points (2000 and 2012) to quantify the effects on CHD mortality attributable to changes in risk factors and therapeutic trends. Results From 2000 to 2012, CHD mortality rates increased by 33.8% in men and by 22.8% in women. The IMPACT model explained 71% of the CHD mortality increase. Most of the mortality increases could be attributed to increases in population risk factors, such as diabetes (43%), physical inactivity (28%) and total cholesterol (24%). Improvements in medical and surgical treatments together prevented or postponed 40.3% of deaths; 10% was attributable to improvements in secondary prevention treatments following MI, while 5.3% to community heart failure treatments. Conclusions CHD mortality in Mexico is increasing due to adverse trends in major risk factors and suboptimal use of CHD treatments. Population-level interventions to reduce CHD risk factors are urgently needed, along with increased access and equitable distribution of therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3108277865,"Purpose We investigated risk factors for breakthrough vitreous hemorrhage (VH) after an intravitreal tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and gas injection in patients with submacular hemorrhage (SMH) associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods The medical records of patients diagnosed with SMH associated with AMD who received an intravitreal tPA (50 μg/0.05 mL) and perfluoropropane gas (0.3 mL) injection were reviewed retrospectively. We analyzed the associations of breakthrough VH with age, sex, best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, AMD subtype, accompanying sub-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hemorrhage, history of cataract surgery, history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, history of drinking and smoking, and history of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication. We also examined the relationships between various parameters, including the area ratio of the SMH to the optic disc (AHD) and the height of the SMH obtained from optical coherence tomography. Results In total, 52 eyes from 52 patients were enrolled in this study; 16 eyes (30%) showed breakthrough VH. The proportions of patients with a current smoking history were 75.0% in the VH group and 22.2% in the non-VH group (p = 0.010). Other factors did not differ significantly between the two groups. The proportion of cases with accompanying sub-RPE hemorrhage was 50.0% and 58.3% in the VH and non-VH groups, respectively (p = 0.763). The AHD (p = 0.001) and SMH height (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly greater in the VH group. In a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the cut-off values of AHD and SMH height were 20.1 and 1208 μm, respectively. According to logistic regression analysis, when the AHD and SMH height were greater than the individual cut-off values, the odds ratio of VH increased by 10.286 fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.452–43.148; p = 0.001) and 75.400 fold (95% CI, 7.991–711.441; p &lt; 0.001), respectively, with respect to their respective reference groups (less than the cut-off value). Among the significant factors associated with VH occurrence, including current smoking, AHD, and SMH height, only current smoking and SMH height were found to be significant in multiple regression analysis (p = 0.040, 0.016). Conclusions The incidence of breakthrough VH was significantly higher in those with current smoking status and for SMH with a larger AHD and greater height. The height of the SMH was more predictable of the possibility of VH than AHD."

N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is used to evaluate HF and myocardial ischemia. Relationships between NT-proBNP and CMD are not well defined in this population.We evaluated resting NT-proBNP levels in 208 women with symptoms and signs of ischemic heart disease, preserved LVEF and no obstructive CAD undergoing clinically indicated invasive coronary flow reserve (CFR) as a measure of CMD-related ischemia and resting left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Chi-square testing was used for categorical variables and ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for continuous variables.Overall, 79% had an elevated resting LVEDP, and mean NT-proBNP was 115 ± 158 pg/mL. NT-proBNP levels correlated directly with age (r = 0.28, p = <0.0001), and indirectly with body mass index (r = -0.21, p = 0.0006), but did not independently associate with CFR. When stratified by NT-proBNP thresholds, higher NT-proBNP was initially associated with lower CFR, which did not persist with adjustment for multiple testing (p = 0.01 and 0.36, respectively).Among women with symptoms and signs of ischemia, preserved LVEF, no obstructive CAD, and undergoing clinically indicated functional coronary angiography (FCA) for suspected CMD, while a majority had elevated resting LVEDP, we failed to find an independent association between CFR and NT-proBNP, although stratified clinical thresholds may relate to lower CFR. Further work is needed to investigate if these findings support the hypothesis that CMD-related ischemia may be a precursor to HFpEF."
https://openalex.org/W3109567889,"Although the popularity of flywheel (FW) devices in sports research is increasing, to date, no study has been designed to test the reliability of electromyographic (EMG) variables during FW squats as a basic lower-body FW resistance exercise. At the primary level, our study was conducted to determine the minimum number of the consecutive flywheel (FW) squat repetitions that need to be averaged in a single set to obtain excellent reliability of peak, mean and three position-specific EMG variables. At the secondary level, comprehensive analysis for peak and mean EMG variables was done. Intra-set reliability was investigated using the minimum number of repetitions determined from the primary level of the study. Twenty-six participants performed five sets of seven squats with three FW loads (0.05, 0.125, 0.225 kg∙m 2 ). EMG signals were collected from eight leg muscles. By averaging twelve consecutive repetitions, we obtained ICC 2.k &gt; 0.95 for mean and peak EMG RMS regardless of the muscle, load or phase of the squat (concentric vs. eccentric). Due to the heterogeneity of the results at the primary level, position-specific variables were excluded from the inter-set reliability analysis at the secondary level. Trustworthy mean and peak EMG variables from the primary level showed good to excellent inter-set reliability. We suggest averaging twelve consecutive squat repetitions to achieve good to excellent intra-session reliability of EMG variables. By following the proposed protocol, activation of leg muscles can be confidently studied in intra-session repeated-measures study designs."

The data are investigated both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the structure (i.e., noun, verb, and prepositional phrases) and function (i.e., stance, referential, and text organizer). The results show some noticeable differences among these sets of writing. The Korean student writers heavily relied on verb phrase-based expressions (e.g., are a lot of ) in their writing whereas the American students preferred noun phrases. Functionally, the Korean writers underused referential function expressions (e.g., the idea of the ) compared to their counterparts. In addition, the prospective Korean university students’ writing was found to represent the widest range of multiword expressions whereas the American students’ argumentative course papers exhibited the smallest range. The findings suggest that prospective Korean university students’ writing tends to use more features of verbal conversation while American university students’ writing exhibits features of structured argumentative writing. The implications for teaching writing and limitations of the study are discussed."

However, it is not established whether the results of screening tests are affected by these factors in psoriasis patients. Objectives To determine whether there is a change in the results of the tuberculin skin test (TST) or the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) in psoriasis patients living in tuberculosis (TB)-endemic area after 12 weeks of methotrexate (MTX) treatment and to investigate the association of the test results with clinical and inflammatory markers. Methods Forty-five patients were selected for a prospective single-arm self-controlled study and followed for at least 18 months. The TST, IGRA, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), and inflammatory factors (erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels), were determined before and after 12 weeks of oral 15 mg per week MTX administration and compared. The associations between the IGRA and TST results were verified before and after treatment according to inflammatory factors and clinical characteristics (age, blood glucose, weight, body mass index, disease duration, and PASI). Results We collected data on 25 patients who completed the full course of therapy and the follow-up. None of the patients developed TB. TST positivity was significantly elevated at week 12 (25% baseline vs 44% at week 12, P &lt; 0.037). Three IGRAs followed the TST conversions. There was no difference between TST and IGRA pre- or posttreatment. Serum IFN-γ increased significantly in week 12 (15.95 pg/ml baseline vs 18.82 pg/ml at week 12, P &lt; 0.005) and tended to be higher among TST-positive patients (P = 0.072). The baseline IGRA was associated with a higher ESR (P = 0.038). None of the test results were associated with clinical characteristics. Conclusions In addition to the classic booster effect, TST conversions in patients using MTX can occur due to an increase in IFN-γ. However, it is not possible to exclude true TST conversions. Therefore, other diagnostic methods, like IGRA or chest tomography, should be used when the TST has intermediate results."
https://openalex.org/W3108354641,"Scrapie, a prion disease of sheep, is highly resistant to conventional deactivation. Numerous methods to deactivate scrapie have been tested in laboratory animal models, and adequate autoclave treatment can reduce or remove the infectivity of some classical scrapie strains depending on the heating parameters used. In this study, we autoclaved brain homogenate from a sheep with US scrapie strain 13–7 for 30 minutes at 121°C. Genetically susceptible VRQ/ARQ sheep were orally inoculated with 3 grams of the autoclaved brain homogenate. For comparison, a second group of sheep was inoculated with a non-autoclaved brain homogenate. Rectal biopsies were used to assess antemortem scrapie disease progression throughout the study. Five out of ten (5/10) sheep that received autoclaved inoculum ultimately developed scrapie after an experimental endpoint of 72 months. These sheep had a mean incubation period of 26.99 months. Two out of five (2/5) positive sheep had detectable PrP Sc in antemortem rectal biopsies, and two (2/5) other sheep had PrP Sc in postmortem rectal tissue. A single sheep (1/5) was positive for scrapie in the CNS, small intestine, and retropharyngeal lymph node but had negative rectal tissue. All of the sheep (10/10) that received non-autoclaved inoculum developed scrapie with a mean incubation period of 20.2 months and had positive rectal biopsies at the earliest timepoint (14.7 months post-inoculation). These results demonstrate that sheep are orally susceptible to US derived classical scrapie strain 13–7 after autoclave treatment at 121°C for 30 minutes. Differences in incubation periods and time interval to first positive rectal biopsies indicate a partial reduction in infectivity titers for the autoclaved inoculum group."

This study was aimed to investigate the genetic diversity and epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical strains in Shaanxi Province, China. Methods From January to December 2016, a total of 298 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients were genotyped by Mcspoligotyping and 15-locus VNTR. Results We found that the Beijing family strains was the most prominent family(81.54%, 243/298). Other family strains included T family(9.06%, 27/298), U family(0.67%, 2/298), LAM9 family(0.34%, 1/298) and Manu family(0.34%, 1/298). The rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) M . Tuberculosis , age, type of case and education between Beijing and non-Beijing family strains were not statistically different, while the distribution in the three different regions among these was statistically significant. VNTR results showed that strains were classified into 280 genotypes, and 33 (11.07%) strains could be grouped into 14 clusters. 11 of the 15-VNTR loci were highly or moderately discriminative according to the Hunter-Gaston discriminatory index. Conclusions We concluded that the Beijing family genotype was the most prevalent genotype and 15-locus VNTR typing might be suitable for genotyping of M . tuberculosis in Shaanxi Province. There was less association between Beijing family genotypes and drug resistance in our study area."
https://openalex.org/W3110073040,"Background Dizygotic (DZ, non-identical) twinning rates vary widely across different regions in the world. With a DZ twinning rate of 45 per 1000 live births, Igbo-Ora Community in South-west Nigeria has the highest dizygotic (DZ) twinning rate in the world. Although several postulations exist on the causes of high DZ twinning rates in Igbo-Ora, no study has yet been conclusive on a definite causative agent. Objective Using qualitative methods, this study explored the perceptions and beliefs of Igbo-Ora residents about the causes of high DZ twinning rates. Methods Focus group discussion sessions and key informant interviews were organized among fathers and mothers of twins, those without twins, and health care providers. Key informant interviews were also held with persons considered to be custodians of culture who may have knowledge relevant to twinning such as traditional rulers, and traditional birth attendants; as well as health care providers, mothers and fathers of twins, and adult twins. Results The results showed three factors featuring as the leading perceived causes of twinning in the community. These included twinning being an act of God, hereditary, and being due to certain foods consumed in the community. Contrary to reports that the consumption of a species of yam ( Dioscorea rotundata ) may be responsible for the DZ twinning in this Community; yam was not prioritized by the respondents as associated with twinning. In contrast, participants repeatedly mentioned the consumption of “ilasa” a soup prepared with okra leaves ( Abelmoschus esculenta ) with water that is obtained from the community, and “amala” a local delicacy produced from cassava ( Manihot esculenta ) as the most likely dietary factors responsible for twinning in the community. Conclusion Since the same foods are consumed in neighboring communities that have lower rates of twinning, we conjecture that nutritional and other environmental factors may produce epigenetic modifications that influence high DZ twinning rates in Igbo-Ora community. We conclude that more directed scientific studies based on these findings are required to further elucidate the etiology of the high rate of DZ twinning in Igbo-Ora."
https://openalex.org/W3108026434,"This study was aimed to characterize the spermatogenic process and its seasonal variation in Desmodus rotundus , in the Caatinga biome, a water-limited ecosystem, with marked water restriction during most of the year. Collections of adult animals were performed during the dry and rainy seasons, and after euthanasia, their testes were processed histologically to perform morphological, morphometric, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyzes. The percentage of seminiferous epithelium, number of Leydig cells per gram of testis, and population of Sertoli cells and A-type spermatogonia presented by D . rotundus were significantly higher in the rainy season, while the percentage of lumen, mitotic index, support capacity performed by Sertoli cells, and overall yield of spermatogenesis were higher in the dry season. The ultrastructure of spermatogenesis was similar to that described in other mammals, and the immunohistochemical analysis revealed activity of the aromatase enzyme in Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, spermatocytes and spermatids, as well as the presence of androgen receptors in Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. FGF2 activity was detected in primary spermatocytes in zygotene and pachytene, as well as secondary spermatocytes and rounded and elongated spermatids, while the BCL-2 protein was expressed in primary spermatocytes in zygotene and pachytene, secondary spermatocytes, and rounded spermatids. The activity of these molecules was similar in both seasons, and associated with the morphometric findings, indicates maintenance in the integrity of the seminiferous epithelium throughout the year. The seasonal study of D . rotundus spermatogenesis indicates a continuous spermatogenesis pattern and suggests a greater production of spermatozoa in the rainy season in the Caatinga biome."
https://openalex.org/W3109730358,"Coughing, huffing and swallowing protect the airway from aspiration. This study was conducted to compare the physical properties of voluntary coughing, huffing and swallowing in healthy subjects. Ten healthy men were asked to huff, cough and swallow repeatedly. Electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded from the left side of the external oblique (EO), sternocleidomastoid, suprahyoid (SH) and thyrohyoid muscles. Airflow was recorded using a face mask with two-way non-rebreathing valves. The expiratory velocity of huffing and coughing and the SH EMG of all actions presented high intraclass correlation coefficients (&gt; 0.8). The inspiratory and expiratory velocities did not differ significantly between coughing and huffing. The expiratory acceleration of coughing was significantly higher than that of huffing, whereas the expiratory volume of coughing was significantly smaller than that of huffing. The EO EMG of coughing and huffing were significantly larger than that of swallowing. The EO EMG activity during the expiratory phase was significantly higher than that of the other phases of both coughing and huffing. The SH EMG of coughing and huffing were significantly smaller than that of swallowing. Correlation analysis revealed that the expiratory velocity of coughing was strongly positively correlated with that of huffing. The expiratory volume of huffing was significantly positively correlated with hand grip strength. These results suggest that EO and SH muscle activities during huffing or coughing differ those during swallowing, and huffing and coughing may work similarly in expiratory function."
https://openalex.org/W3110219861,"Efficient biodiversity conservation requires that limited resources be allocated in accordance with national responsibilities and priorities. Without appropriate computational tools, the process of determining these national responsibilities and conservation priorities is time intensive when considering many species across geographic scales. Here, we have developed a computational tool as a module for the ArcGIS geographic information system. The ArcGIS National Responsibility Assessment Tool (NRA-Tool) can be used to create hierarchical lists of national responsibilities and priorities for global species conservation. Our tool will allow conservationists to prioritize conservation efforts and to focus limited resources on relevant species and regions. We showcase our tool with data on 258 bird species and various biophysical regions, including Environmental Zones in 58 Asian countries and regions. Our tool provides a decision support system for conservation policy with attractive and easily interpretable visual outputs illustrating national responsibilities and priorities for species conservation. The graphical output allows for smooth integration into assessment reports, such as the European Article 17 report, the Living Planet Index report, or similar regional and global reports."
