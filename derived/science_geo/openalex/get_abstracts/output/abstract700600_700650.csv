https://openalex.org/W3210084966,"Water in nanoscale cavities is ubiquitous and of central importance to everyday phenomena in geology and biology. However, the properties of nanoscale water can be substantially different from those of bulk water, as shown, for example, by the anomalously low dielectric constant of water in nanochannels1, near frictionless water flow2 or the possible existence of a square ice phase3. Such properties suggest that nanoconfined water could be engineered for technological applications in nanofluidics4, electrolyte materials5 and water desalination6. Unfortunately, challenges in experimentally characterizing water at the nanoscale and the high cost of first-principles simulations have prevented the molecular-level understanding required to control the behaviour of water. Here we combine a range of computational approaches to enable a first-principles-level investigation of a single layer of water within a graphene-like channel. We find that monolayer water exhibits surprisingly rich and diverse phase behaviour that is highly sensitive to temperature and the van der Waals pressure acting within the nanochannel. In addition to multiple molecular phases with melting temperatures varying non-monotonically by more than 400 kelvins with pressure, we predict a hexatic phase, which is an intermediate between a solid and a liquid, and a superionic phase with a high electrical conductivity exceeding that of battery materials. Notably, this suggests that nanoconfinement could be a promising route towards superionic behaviour under easily accessible conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4295762974,"Hund's multiplicity rule states that a higher spin state has a lower energy for a given electronic configuration1. Rephrasing this rule for molecular excited states predicts a positive energy gap between spin-singlet and spin-triplet excited states, as has been consistent with numerous experimental observations over almost a century. Here we report a fluorescent molecule that disobeys Hund's rule and has a negative singlet-triplet energy gap of -11 ± 2 meV. The energy inversion of the singlet and triplet excited states results in delayed fluorescence with short time constants of 0.2 μs, which anomalously decrease with decreasing temperature owing to the emissive singlet character of the lowest-energy excited state. Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) using this molecule exhibited a fast transient electroluminescence decay with a peak external quantum efficiency of 17%, demonstrating its potential implications for optoelectronic devices, including displays, lighting and lasers."
https://openalex.org/W4295763219,"Advancing the spontaneous bottom-up construction of artificial cells with high organizational complexity and diverse functionality remains an unresolved issue at the interface between living and non-living matter1-4. Here, to address this challenge, we developed a living material assembly process based on the capture and on-site processing of spatially segregated bacterial colonies within individual coacervate microdroplets for the endogenous construction of membrane-bounded, molecularly crowded, and compositionally, structurally and morphologically complex synthetic cells. The bacteriogenic protocells inherit diverse biological components, exhibit multifunctional cytomimetic properties and can be endogenously remodelled to include a spatially partitioned DNA-histone nucleus-like condensate, membranized water vacuoles and a three-dimensional network of F-actin proto-cytoskeletal filaments. The ensemble is biochemically energized by ATP production derived from implanted live Escherichia coli cells to produce a cellular bionic system with amoeba-like external morphology and integrated life-like properties. Our results demonstrate a bacteriogenic strategy for the bottom-up construction of functional protoliving microdevices and provide opportunities for the fabrication of new synthetic cell modules and augmented living/synthetic cell constructs with potential applications in engineered synthetic biology and biotechnology."

https://openalex.org/W4295762999,"A hallmark of strongly correlated quantum materials is the rich phase diagram resulting from competing and intertwined phases with nearly degenerate ground-state energies1,2. A well-known example is the copper oxides, in which a charge density wave (CDW) is ordered well above and strongly coupled to the magnetic order to form spin-charge-separated stripes that compete with superconductivity1,2. Recently, such rich phase diagrams have also been shown in correlated topological materials. In 2D kagome lattice metals consisting of corner-sharing triangles, the geometry of the lattice can produce flat bands with localized electrons3,4, non-trivial topology5-7, chiral magnetic order8,9, superconductivity and CDW order10-15. Although CDW has been found in weakly electron-correlated non-magnetic AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs)10-15, it has not yet been observed in correlated magnetic-ordered kagome lattice metals4,16-21. Here we report the discovery of CDW in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered phase of kagome lattice FeGe (refs. 16-19). The CDW in FeGe occurs at wavevectors identical to that of AV3Sb5 (refs. 10-15), enhances the AFM ordered moment and induces an emergent anomalous Hall effect22,23. Our findings suggest that CDW in FeGe arises from the combination of electron-correlations-driven AFM order and van Hove singularities (vHSs)-driven instability possibly associated with a chiral flux phase24-28, in stark contrast to strongly correlated copper oxides1,2 and nickelates29-31, in which the CDW precedes or accompanies the magnetic order."

https://openalex.org/W4295763215,"Nutrients and energy have emerged as central modulators of developmental programmes in plants and animals1-3. The evolutionarily conserved target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase is a master integrator of nutrient and energy signalling that controls growth. Despite its key regulatory roles in translation, proliferation, metabolism and autophagy2-5, little is known about how TOR shapes developmental transitions and differentiation. Here we show that glucose-activated TOR kinase controls genome-wide histone H3 trimethylation at K27 (H3K27me3) in Arabidopsis thaliana, which regulates cell fate and development6-10. We identify FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT ENDOSPERM (FIE), an indispensable component of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which catalyses H3K27me3 (refs. 6-8,10-12), as a TOR target. Direct phosphorylation by TOR promotes the dynamic translocation of FIE from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Mutation of the phosphorylation site on FIE abrogates the global H3K27me3 landscape, reprogrammes the transcriptome and disrupts organogenesis in plants. Moreover, glucose-TOR-FIE-PRC2 signalling modulates vernalization-induced floral transition. We propose that this signalling axis serves as a nutritional checkpoint leading to epigenetic silencing of key transcription factor genes that specify stem cell destiny in shoot and root meristems and control leaf, flower and silique patterning, branching and vegetative-to-reproduction transition. Our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism of nutrient signalling in direct epigenome reprogramming, with broad relevance for the developmental control of multicellular organisms."
https://openalex.org/W4295763070,"Increased rates of deformation and seismicity are well-established precursors to volcanic eruptions, and their interpretation forms the basis for eruption warnings worldwide. Rates of ground displacement and the number of earthquakes escalate before many eruptions1-3, as magma forces its way towards the surface. However, the pre-eruptive patterns of deformation and seismicity vary widely. Here we show how an eruption beginning on 19 March 2021 at Fagradalsfjall, Iceland, was preceded by a period of tectonic stress release ending with a decline in deformation and seismicity over several days preceding the eruption onset. High rates of deformation and seismicity occurred from 24 February to mid-March in relation to gradual emplacement of an approximately 9-km-long magma-filled dyke, between the surface and 8 km depth (volume approximately 34 × 106 m3), as well as the triggering of strike-slip earthquakes up to magnitude MW 5.64. As stored tectonic stress was systematically released, there was less lateral migration of magma and a reduction in both the deformation rates and seismicity. Weaker crust near the surface may also have contributed to reduced seismicity, as the depth of active magma emplacement progressively shallowed. This demonstrates that the interaction between volcanoes and tectonic stress as well as crustal layering need to be fully considered when forecasting eruptions."
https://openalex.org/W4295763173,"On-target-off-tissue drug engagement is an important source of adverse effects that constrains the therapeutic window of drug candidates1,2. In diseases of the central nervous system, drugs with brain-restricted pharmacology are highly desirable. Here we report a strategy to achieve inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) while sparing mTOR activity elsewhere through the use of the brain-permeable mTOR inhibitor RapaLink-1 and the brain-impermeable FKBP12 ligand RapaBlock. We show that this drug combination mitigates the systemic effects of mTOR inhibitors but retains the efficacy of RapaLink-1 in glioblastoma xenografts. We further present a general method to design cell-permeable, FKBP12-dependent kinase inhibitors from known drug scaffolds. These inhibitors are sensitive to deactivation by RapaBlock, enabling the brain-restricted inhibition of their respective kinase targets."
https://openalex.org/W4295763170,"Understanding cell state transitions and purposefully controlling them is a longstanding challenge in biology. Here we present cell state transition assessment and regulation (cSTAR), an approach for mapping cell states, modelling transitions between them and predicting targeted interventions to convert cell fate decisions. cSTAR uses omics data as input, classifies cell states, and develops a workflow that transforms the input data into mechanistic models that identify a core signalling network, which controls cell fate transitions by influencing whole-cell networks. By integrating signalling and phenotypic data, cSTAR models how cells manoeuvre in Waddington’s landscape1 and make decisions about which cell fate to adopt. Notably, cSTAR devises interventions to control the movement of cells in Waddington’s landscape. Testing cSTAR in a cellular model of differentiation and proliferation shows a high correlation between quantitative predictions and experimental data. Applying cSTAR to different types of perturbation and omics datasets, including single-cell data, demonstrates its flexibility and scalability and provides new biological insights. The ability of cSTAR to identify targeted perturbations that interconvert cell fates will enable designer approaches for manipulating cellular development pathways and mechanistically underpinned therapeutic interventions. An approach called cell state transition assessment and regulation uses diverse multiomics data to map cell states, model their transitions, and understand the signalling networks that control them."
https://openalex.org/W4295763188,"Arctic sea ice is diminishing with climate warming1 at a rate unmatched for at least 1,000 years2. As the receding ice pack raises commercial interest in the Arctic3, it has become more variable and mobile4, which increases safety risks to maritime users5. Satellite observations of sea-ice thickness are currently unavailable during the crucial melt period from May to September, when they would be most valuable for applications such as seasonal forecasting6, owing to major challenges in the processing of altimetry data7. Here we use deep learning and numerical simulations of the CryoSat-2 radar altimeter response to overcome these challenges and generate a pan-Arctic sea-ice thickness dataset for the Arctic melt period. CryoSat-2 observations capture the spatial and the temporal patterns of ice melting rates recorded by independent sensors and match the time series of sea-ice volume modelled by the Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modelling and Assimilation System reanalysis8. Between 2011 and 2020, Arctic sea-ice thickness was 1.87 ± 0.10 m at the start of the melting season in May and 0.82 ± 0.11 m by the end of the melting season in August. Our year-round sea-ice thickness record unlocks opportunities for understanding Arctic climate feedbacks on different timescales. For instance, sea-ice volume observations from the early summer may extend the lead time of skilful August-October sea-ice forecasts by several months, at the peak of the Arctic shipping season."
https://openalex.org/W4295762973,"Abstract Recent Icelandic rifting events have illuminated the roles of centralized crustal magma reservoirs and lateral magma transport 1–4 , important characteristics of mid-ocean ridge magmatism 1,5 . A consequence of such shallow crustal processing of magmas 4,5 is the overprinting of signatures that trace the origin, evolution and transport of melts in the uppermost mantle and lowermost crust 6,7 . Here we present unique insights into processes occurring in this zone from integrated petrologic and geochemical studies of the 2021 Fagradalsfjall eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula in Iceland. Geochemical analyses of basalts erupted during the first 50 days of the eruption, combined with associated gas emissions, reveal direct sourcing from a near-Moho magma storage zone. Geochemical proxies, which signify different mantle compositions and melting conditions, changed at a rate unparalleled for individual basaltic eruptions globally. Initially, the erupted lava was dominated by melts sourced from the shallowest mantle but over the following three weeks became increasingly dominated by magmas generated at a greater depth. This exceptionally rapid trend in erupted compositions provides an unprecedented temporal record of magma mixing that filters the mantle signal, consistent with processing in near-Moho melt lenses containing 10 7 –10 8 m 3 of basaltic magma. Exposing previously inaccessible parts of this key magma processing zone to near-real-time investigations provides new insights into the timescales and operational mode of basaltic magma systems."
https://openalex.org/W4295763006,"Telomeres, the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, play pivotal parts in ageing and cancer and are targets of DNA damage and the DNA damage response1–5. Little is known about the structure of telomeric chromatin at the molecular level. Here we used negative stain electron microscopy and single-molecule magnetic tweezers to characterize 3-kbp-long telomeric chromatin fibres. We also obtained the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the condensed telomeric tetranucleosome and its dinucleosome unit. The structure displayed close stacking of nucleosomes with a columnar arrangement, and an unusually short nucleosome repeat length that comprised about 132 bp DNA wound in a continuous superhelix around histone octamers. This columnar structure is primarily stabilized by the H2A carboxy-terminal and histone amino-terminal tails in a synergistic manner. The columnar conformation results in exposure of the DNA helix, which may make it susceptible to both DNA damage and the DNA damage response. The conformation also exists in an alternative open state, in which one nucleosome is unstacked and flipped out, which exposes the acidic patch of the histone surface. The structural features revealed in this work suggest mechanisms by which protein factors involved in telomere maintenance can access telomeric chromatin in its compact form. Cryogenic electron microscopy analyses reveal a new, compact structure of telomeric chromatin, providing mechanistic insight into telomere maintenance and function."
https://openalex.org/W4295763140,"Distinguishing sensory stimuli caused by changes in the environment from those caused by an animal's own actions is a hallmark of sensory processing1. Saccades are rapid eye movements that shift the image on the retina. How visual systems differentiate motion of the image induced by saccades from actual motion in the environment is not fully understood2. Here we discovered that in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) the two types of motion evoke distinct activity patterns. This is because, during saccades, V1 combines the visual input with a strong non-visual input arriving from the thalamic pulvinar nucleus. The non-visual input triggers responses that are specific to the direction of the saccade and the visual input triggers responses that are specific to the direction of the shift of the stimulus on the retina, yet the preferred directions of these two responses are uncorrelated. Thus, the pulvinar input ensures differential V1 responses to external and self-generated motion. Integration of external sensory information with information about body movement may be a general mechanism for sensory cortices to distinguish between self-generated and external stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W4295762972,"RNA splicing, the process of intron removal from pre-mRNA, is essential for the regulation of gene expression. It is controlled by the spliceosome, a megadalton RNA-protein complex that assembles de novo on each pre-mRNA intron through an ordered assembly of intermediate complexes1,2. Spliceosome activation is a major control step that requires substantial protein and RNA rearrangements leading to a catalytically active complex1-5. Splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) protein-a subunit of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein6-is phosphorylated during spliceosome activation7-10, but the kinase that is responsible has not been identified. Here we show that cyclin-dependent kinase 11 (CDK11) associates with SF3B1 and phosphorylates threonine residues at its N terminus during spliceosome activation. The phosphorylation is important for the association between SF3B1 and U5 and U6 snRNAs in the activated spliceosome, termed the Bact complex, and the phosphorylation can be blocked by OTS964, a potent and selective inhibitor of CDK11. Inhibition of CDK11 prevents spliceosomal transition from the precatalytic complex B to the activated complex Bact and leads to widespread intron retention and accumulation of non-functional spliceosomes on pre-mRNAs and chromatin. We demonstrate a central role of CDK11 in spliceosome assembly and splicing regulation and characterize OTS964 as a highly selective CDK11 inhibitor that suppresses spliceosome activation and splicing."
https://openalex.org/W4295763153,"The Hubbard model constitutes one of the most celebrated theoretical frameworks of condensed-matter physics. It describes strongly correlated phases of interacting quantum particles confined in lattice potentials1,2. For bosons, the Hubbard Hamiltonian has been deeply scrutinized for short-range on-site interactions3-6. However, accessing longer-range couplings has remained elusive experimentally7. This marks the frontier towards the extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which enables insulating ordered phases at fractional lattice fillings8-12. Here we implement this Hamiltonian by confining semiconductor dipolar excitons in an artificial two-dimensional square lattice. Strong dipolar repulsions between nearest-neighbour lattice sites then stabilize an insulating state at half filling. This characteristic feature of the extended Bose-Hubbard model exhibits the signatures theoretically expected for a chequerboard spatial order. Our work thus highlights that dipolar excitons enable controlled implementations of boson-like arrays with strong off-site interactions, in lattices with programmable geometries and more than 100 sites."
https://openalex.org/W4295763056,"Studying strong electron correlations has been an essential driving force for pushing the frontiers of condensed matter physics. In particular, in the vicinity of correlation-driven quantum phase transitions (QPTs), quantum critical fluctuations of multiple degrees of freedom facilitate exotic many-body states and quantum critical behaviours beyond Landau's framework1. Recently, moiré heterostructures of van der Waals materials have been demonstrated as highly tunable quantum platforms for exploring fascinating, strongly correlated quantum physics2-22. Here we report the observation of tunable quantum criticalities in an experimental simulator of the extended Hubbard model with spin-valley isospins arising in chiral-stacked twisted double bilayer graphene (cTDBG). Scaling analysis shows a quantum two-stage criticality manifesting two distinct quantum critical points as the generalized Wigner crystal transits to a Fermi liquid by varying the displacement field, suggesting the emergence of a critical intermediate phase. The quantum two-stage criticality evolves into a quantum pseudo criticality as a high parallel magnetic field is applied. In such a pseudo criticality, we find that the quantum critical scaling is only valid above a critical temperature, indicating a weak first-order QPT therein. Our results demonstrate a highly tunable solid-state simulator with intricate interplay of multiple degrees of freedom for exploring exotic quantum critical states and behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W4295907356,"The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is the epicenter of cellular aerobic metabolism. TCA cycle intermediates facilitate energy production and provide anabolic precursors, but also function as intra- and extracellular metabolic signals regulating pleiotropic biological processes. Despite the importance of circulating TCA cycle metabolites as signaling molecules, the source of circulating TCA cycle intermediates remains uncertain. We observe that in mice, the concentration of TCA cycle intermediates in the portal blood exceeds that in tail blood indicating that the gut is a major contributor to circulating TCA cycle metabolites. With a focus on succinate as a representative of a TCA cycle intermediate with signaling activities and using a combination of gut microbiota depletion mouse models and isotopomer tracing, we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota is not a major contributor to circulating succinate. Moreover, we demonstrate that endogenous succinate production is markedly higher than intestinal succinate absorption in normal physiological conditions. Altogether, these results indicate that endogenous succinate production within the intestinal tissue is a major physiological source of circulating succinate. These results provide a foundation for an investigation into the role of the intestine in regulating circulating TCA cycle metabolites and their potential signaling effects on health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4295900068,"Genital mycoplasmas can break the cervical barrier and cause intraamniotic infection and preterm birth. This study developed a six-chamber vagina-cervix-decidua-organ-on-a-chip (VCD-OOC) that recapitulates the female reproductive tract during pregnancy with culture chambers populated by vaginal epithelial cells, cervical epithelial and stromal cells, and decidual cells. Cells cultured in VCD-OOC were characterized by morphology and immunostaining for cell-specific markers. We transferred the media from the decidual cell chamber of the VCD-OOC to decidual cell chamber in feto-maternal interface organ-on-a-chip (FMi-OOC), which contains the fetal membrane layers. An ascending Ureaplasma parvum infection was created in VCD-OOC. U. parvum was monitored for 48 h post-infection with their cytotoxicity (LDH assay) and inflammatory effects (multiplex cytokine assay) in the cells tested. An ascending U. parvum infection model of PTB was developed using CD-1 mice. The cell morphology and expression of cell-specific markers in the VCD-OOC mimicked those seen in lower genital tract tissues. U. parvum reached the cervical epithelial cells and decidua within 48 h and did not cause cell death in VCD-OOC or FMi-OOC cells. U. parvum infection promoted minimal inflammation, while the combination of U. parvum and LPS promoted massive inflammation in the VCD-OOC and FMi-OOC cells. In the animal model, U. parvum vaginal inoculation of low-dose U. parvum did not result in PTB, and even a high dose had only some effects on PTB (20%). However, intra-amniotic injection of U. parvum resulted in 67% PTB. We report the colonization of U. parvum in various cell types; however, inconsistent, and low-grade inflammation across multiple cell types suggests poor immunogenicity induced by U. parvum."
https://openalex.org/W4295899286,"Despite several new therapeutic options for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), disease relapse remains a significant challenge. We have previously demonstrated that augmenting ceramides can counter various drug-resistance mechanisms, leading to enhanced cell death in cancer cells and extended survival in animal models. Using a nanoscale delivery system for ceramide (ceramide nanoliposomes, CNL), we investigated the effect of CNL within a standard of care venetoclax/cytarabine (Ara-C) regimen. We demonstrate that CNL augmented the efficacy of venetoclax/cytarabine in in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models of AML. CNL treatment induced non-apoptotic cytotoxicity, and augmented cell death induced by Ara-C and venetoclax. Mechanistically, CNL reduced both venetoclax (Mcl-1) and cytarabine (Chk1) drug-resistant signaling pathways. Moreover, venetoclax and Ara-C augmented the generation of endogenous pro-death ceramide species, which was intensified with CNL. Taken together, CNL has the potential to be utilized as an adjuvant therapy to improve outcomes, potentially extending survival, in patients with AML."
https://openalex.org/W4295900812,"This study investigates the validity of path models in which interpersonal motivation positively predicts behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement, and behavioral engagement positively predicts superior performance in collaborative learning in university classes. The path model was tested using structural equation modeling. The results of the analyses showed that weak positive paths from identified regulation to all three aspects of engagement were substantial. In addition, a weak positive path from intrinsic motivation was significant for emotional engagement. For performance, the weak positive path from behavioral engagement was statistically significant. Based on these results, the implications of the motivation theory and practice in higher education are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4295907785,"Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to infection that can cause widespread effects on other organs including cardiovascular depression, hypotension and organ failure. The receptor for Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), NOP is expressed on immune cells and these cells can release the peptide. Exogenous N/OFQ can dilate blood vessels and this peptide is increased in animal and human sepsis. We hypothesise that NOP receptors are present on vascular endothelial cells and therefore provide the target for released N/OFQ to cause vasodilation and hence hypotension. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMC) freshly prepared from umbilical cords and up to passage 4, we assessed NOP mRNA expression by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), NOP surface receptor expression using a fluorescent NOP selective probe (N/OFQATTO594) and NOP receptor function with N/OFQ stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. As an in vitro sepsis mimic we variably incubated cells with 100ng/ml Lipopolysaccharide and Peptidoglycan G (LPS/PepG). HUVECs express NOP mRNA and this was reduced by ~80% (n = 49) after 24-48 hours treatment with LPS/PepG. Untreated cells do not express surface NOP receptors but when treated with LPS/PepG the reduced mRNA was translated into protein visualised by N/OFQATTO594 binding (n = 49). These NOP receptors in treated cells produced an N/OFQ (1μM) driven increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation (n = 20). One (of 50) HUVEC lines expressed NOP mRNA and receptor protein in the absence of LPS/PepG treatment. In contrast, HVSMC expressed NOP mRNA and surface receptor protein (n = 10) independently of LPS/PepG treatment. These receptors were also coupled to ERK1/2 where N/OFQ (1μM) increased phosphorylation. Collectively these data show that an in vitro sepsis mimic (LPS/PepG) upregulates functional NOP expression in the vascular endothelium. Activation of these endothelial receptors as suggested from in vivo whole animal work may contribute to the hypotensive response seen in sepsis. Moreover, blockade of these receptors might be a useful adjunct in the treatment of sepsis."

https://openalex.org/W4295897948,"The straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is a pteropodid whose conservation is crucial for maintaining functional connectivity of plant populations in tropical Africa. Land conversion has pushed this species to adapt to roosting in urban centers across its range. These colonies often host millions of individuals, creating intensive human-bat contact interfaces that could facilitate the spillover of coronaviruses shed by these bats. A better understanding of coronavirus dynamics in these roosts is needed to identify peak times of exposure risk in order to propose evidence-based management that supports safe human-bat coexistence, as well as the conservation of this chiropteran. We studied the temporal patterns of coronavirus shedding in E. helvum, by testing thousands of longitudinally-collected fecal samples from two spatially distant urban roosts in Ghana and Tanzania. Shedding of coronaviruses peaked during the second part of pup weaning in both roosts. Assuming that coronavirus shedding is directly related to spillover risk, our results indicate that exposure mitigation should target reducing contact between people and E. helvum roosts during the pup ""weaning"" period. This recommendation can be applied across the many highly-populated urban sites occupied by E. helvum across Africa."
https://openalex.org/W4295900099,"Darwin Core, the data standard used for sharing modern biodiversity and paleodiversity occurrence records, has previously lacked proper mechanisms for reporting what is known about the estimated age range of specimens from deep time. This has led to data providers putting these data in fields where they cannot easily be found by users, which impedes the reuse and improvement of these data by other researchers. Here we describe the development of the Chronometric Age Extension to Darwin Core, a ratified, community-developed extension that enables the reporting of ages of specimens from deeper time and the evidence supporting these estimates. The extension standardizes reporting about the methods or assays used to determine an age and other critical information like uncertainty. It gives data providers flexibility about the level of detail reported, focusing on the minimum information needed for reuse while still allowing for significant detail if providers have it. Providing a standardized format for reporting these data will make them easier to find and search and enable researchers to pinpoint specimens of interest for data improvement or accumulate more data for broad temporal studies. The Chronometric Age Extension was also the first community-managed vocabulary to undergo the new Biodiversity Informatics Standards (TDWG) review and ratification process, thus providing a blueprint for future Darwin Core extension development."
https://openalex.org/W4295903894,"Characterizing persistent malaria transmission that occurs after the combined deployment of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is critical to guide malaria control and elimination efforts. This requires a detailed understanding of both human and vector behaviors at the same temporal and spatial scale. Cross-sectional human behavior evaluations and mosquito collections were performed in parallel in Magude district, Mozambique. Net use and the exact time when participant moved into each of five environments (outdoor, indoor before bed, indoor in bed, indoor after getting up, and outdoor after getting up) were recorded for individuals from three different age groups and both sexes during a dry and a rainy season. Malaria mosquitoes were collected with CDC light traps in combination with collection bottle rotators. The percentage of residual exposure to host-seeking vectors that occurred in each environment was calculated for five local malaria vectors with different biting behaviors, and the actual (at observed levels of LLIN use) and potential (i.e. if all residents had used an LLIN) personal protection conferred by LLINs was estimated. Anopheles arabiensis was responsible for more than 74% of residents’ residual exposure to host-seeking vectors during the Magude project. The other four vector species ( An . funestus s . s ., An . parensis , An . squamosus and An . merus) were responsible for less than 10% each. The personal protection conferred by LLINs prevented only 39.2% of the exposure to host-seeking vectors that survived the implementation of both IRS and LLINs, and it differed significantly across seasons, vector species and age groups. At the observed levels of bednet use, 12.5% of all residual exposure to host-seeking vectors occurred outdoor during the evening, 21.9% indoor before going to bed, almost two thirds (64%) while people were in bed, 1.4% indoors after getting up and 0.2% outdoor after leaving the house. Almost a third of the residual exposure to host-seeking vectors (32.4%) occurred during the low transmission season. The residual bites of An . funestus s . s . and An . parensis outdoors and indoor before bedtime, of An . arabiensis indoors when people are in bed, and of An . squamosus both indoors and outdoors, are likely to have sustained malaria transmission throughout the Magude project. By increasing LLIN use, an additional 24.1% of exposure to the remaining hosts-seeking vectors could have been prevented. Since An . arabiensis , the most abundant vector, feeds primarily while people are in bed, increasing net use and net feeding inhibition (through e.g. community awareness activities and the selection of more effective LLINs) could significantly reduce the exposure to remaining host-seeking mosquitoes. Nonetheless, supplementary interventions aiming to reduce human-vector contact outdoors and/or indoors before people go to bed (e.g. through larval source management, window and eave screening, eave tubes, and spatial repellents) will be needed to reduce residual exposure to the outdoor and early biting An . funestus s . s . and An . parensis ."
https://openalex.org/W4295905008,"Background Observations based on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 early into the COVID-19 pandemic have suggested a reduced burden in tropical regions leading to the assumption of a dichotomy between cold and dry and wet and warm climates. Objectives Analyzing more than a whole year of COVID-19 infection data, this study intents to refine the understanding of meteorological variables (temperature, humidity, precipitation and cloud coverage) on COVID-19 transmission in settings that experience distinct seasonal changes. Methods and findings A time stratified case-crossover design was adopted with a conditional Poisson model in combination with a distributed lag nonlinear model to assess the short-term impact of mentioned meteorological factors on COVID-19 infections in five US study sites (New York City (NYC); Marion County, Indiana (MCI); Baltimore and Baltimore County, Maryland (BCM); Franklin County, Ohio (FCO); King County, Washington (KCW)). Higher-than-average temperatures were consistently associated with a decreased relative risk (RR) of COVID-19 infection in four study sites. At 20 degrees Celsius COVID-19 infection was associated with a relative risk of 0.35 (95%CI: 0.20–0.60) in NYC, 1.03 (95%CI:0.57–1.84) in MCI, 0.34 (95%CI: 0.20–0.57) in BCM, 0.52 (95%CI: 0.31–0.87) in FCO and 0.21 (95%CI: 0.10–0.44) in KCW. Higher-than-average humidity levels were associated with an increased relative risk of COVID-19 infection in four study sites. Relative to their respective means, at a humidity level of 15 g/kg (specific humidity) the RR was 5.83 (95%CI: 2.05–16.58) in BCM, at a humidity level of 10 g/kg the RR was 3.44 (95%CI: 1.95–6.01) in KCW. Conclusions The results of this study suggest opposed effects for higher-than-average temperature and humidity concerning the risk of COVID-19 infection. While a distinct seasonal pattern of COVID-19 has not yet emerged, warm and humid weather should not be generally regarded as a time of reduced risk of COVID-19 infections."

https://openalex.org/W4295898530,"Wearing masks or personal protective equipment (PPE) has become an integral part of the occupational life of physicians due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Most physicians have been developing various health hazards related to the use of different protective gears. This study aimed to determine the burden and spectrum of various health hazards associated with using masks or PPE and their associated risk factors.This cross-sectional survey was conducted in Dhaka Medical College from March 01-May 30, 2021, among physicians from different public hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We analyzed the responses of 506 physicians who completed case record forms through Google forms or hard copies.The mean (SD) age of the respondents was 35.4 [7.7], and 69.4% were men. Approximately 40% were using full PPE, and 55% were using N-95 masks. A total of 489 (96.6%) patients experienced at least one health hazard. The reported severe health hazards were syncope, severe dyspnea, severe chest pain, and anaphylaxis. Headache, dizziness, mood irritation, chest pain, excessive sweating, panic attack, and permanent facial disfigurement were the minor health hazards reported. Extended periods of work in the COVID-19-unit, reuse of masks, diabetes, obesity, and mental stress were risk factors for dyspnea. The risk factors for headaches were female sex, diabetes, and previous primary headaches. Furthermore, female sex and reusing masks for an extended period (> 6 h) were risk factors for facial disfigurement. The risk factors for excessive sweating were female sex and additional evening office practice for an extended period.Healthcare workers experienced several occupational hazards after using masks and PPE. Therefore, an appropriate policy is required to reduce such risks."
https://openalex.org/W4295900097,"Chronic low-grade inflammation has been suggested as a key factor in the association between stress exposure and long-term health. Care work is recognized as a profession with a high degree of job stress and health risks. However, for care professionals, the study base on inflammatory activity due to adverse working conditions is limited.The aim of this study was to explore associations between self-reported psychosocial working conditions and care professionals' biomarkers of systemic low-grade inflammation.N = 140 geriatric care professionals (79.3% females, mean age = 44.1 years) of six care facilities were enrolled in a cross-sectional study consisting of standardized medical examinations and employee surveys. Standardized questionnaires were used for evaluation of psychosocial work characteristics (work overload, job autonomy, social support) based on Karasek's job strain model. Blood samples were drawn for two biomarkers of inflammatory activity: C-reactive protein (CRP) and leukocyte count. Analyses comprised uni- and multivariate logistic and linear regression analyses.We determined a proportion of 5.4% of care professionals with increased low-grade inflammation. We further observed a relationship between job autonomy and CRP, such that reports of high job autonomy were associated with increased levels of CRP (adjusted OR = 4.10, 95% CI [1.10, 15.26], p = .035), which was robust in additional analyses on further potential confounders. No significant associations with participants' leukocyte numbers were found.This exploratory study contributes to the research base on links between workplace stress and ensuing illness in care professionals. Our findings may help to identify risk and protective factors of the work environment for chronic low-grade inflammation. The results require further scrutiny, and future prospective studies on associations of psychosocial working conditions, low-grade inflammation and long-term health outcomes in care professionals are needed."

The Tactile Biography Questionnaire (TBQ) allows to quantify individual differences in affective touch experiences throughout life. The aim of this article is to present a contribution to its validation in the Italian population. Data analysis were run on a sample of 2040 Italian individuals (Females = 1342, 64%) participating in an on-line survey. Confirmatory Factor Analysis and invariance analyses for gender were applied. Concurrent validity was checked using two specific subscales of the Touch Avoidance Questionnaire (TAQ-i.e., Family and Stranger). The four-dimensional structure of the TBQ was confirmed in the overall sample and by gender. Also, the TBQ showed an excellent internal consistency and a good concurrent validity with TAQ. The present study suggests that the TBQ can be used to support healthcare professionals and researchers to assess experiences of affective touch in different settings."
https://openalex.org/W4295908843,"Numerous methods for modeling gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in rats exist. However, their repeatability and stability are unclear. This study aimed to compare the effects of high-fat and high-sugar (HFHS) diet, HFHS diet combined with streptozotocin (STZ) administration, and HFHS diet combined with movement restriction (MR) modeling methods on rat models to confirm the best method for constructing a rat model of GDM.Forty female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10): the normal control (NC), HFHS, HFHS+STZ, and HFHS+MR groups. The rats in the NC group were fed with a standard diet, and those in the remaining groups were fed with a HFHS diet. The rats in the HFHS+STZ group received 25 mg/kg STZ on their first day of pregnancy, and those in the HFHS+MR group were subjected to MR during pregnancy. Bodyweight, food intake, water intake, fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model assessment of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IS), homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function, pancreatic and placental morphology, and the expression levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) in placentas were then quantified. Moreover, iTRAQ was used to identify placental proteomics.During pregnancy, the rats in the HFHS+STZ group showed FBG levels that were kept stable in a state of moderate hyperglycemia; the typical GDM symptoms of polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, and increased body weight; and the modeling rate of 87.5%. On the first and 19th days of pregnancy, the rats in the HFHS group showed higher FBG than that of the NC group, increasing body weight and food intake and the modeling rate of 50%. On the 19th day of pregnancy, the FBG of the rats in the HFHS+MR group was higher than that of the rats in the NC group, and the modeling rate of 42.9%. Comparison with the NC group revealed that the three modeling groups exhibited increased FINS and HOMA-IR, decreased HOMA-IS, and different degrees of pathological changes in pancreases and placentas. Among the groups, the HFHS+STZ group displayed the greatest changes with significant reductions in the numbers of pancreatic and placental cells and appeared cavitation. The expression levels of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in the placentas of the HFHS+STZ and HFHS+MR groups were higher than those in the placentas of the NC and HFHS groups. The above results indicated that the rats in the HFHS+STZ group showed the best performance in terms of modeling indicators. After the changes in placental proteomics in the HFHS+STZ group were compared with those in the NC group, we found that in the HFHS+STZ group, five proteins were up-regulated and 18 were down-regulated; these proteins were enriched in estrogen signaling pathways.HFHS combined with the intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg STZ was the best modeling method for the nonspontaneous model of experimentally induced GDM, and its modeling rate was high. The pathological characteristics of the constructed GDM rat model were similar to those of human patients with GDM. Moreover, the model was stable and reliable. The modeling method can provide a basis for constructing a GDM rat model for subsequent research on the prevention and treatment of GDM."
https://openalex.org/W4295908922,"Although bacterial detection by 16S rRNA gene amplicon DNA sequencing is a widely-applied technique, standardized methods for sample preparation and DNA extraction are needed to ensure accuracy, reproducibility, and scalability for automation. To develop these methods for bovine bulk milk, we assembled and tested a bacterial cell mock community (BCMC) containing bacterial species commonly found in milk. The following protocol variations were examined:: BCMC enumeration (colony enumeration or microscopy), sample volume (200 μl to 30 ml), sample storage condition (frozen in PBS or 25% glycerol or exposure to freeze-thaw cycles), cell lysis method (bead-beating, vortex, enzymatic), and DNA extraction procedure (MagMAX Total, MagMAX CORE, and MagMAX Ultra 2.0, with and without either Proteinase K or RNase A). Cell enumeration by microscopy was more accurate for quantification of the BCMC contents. We found that least 10 mL (≥ 104 cells in high quality milk) is needed for reproducible bacterial detection by 16S rRNA gene amplicon DNA sequencing, whereas variations in storage conditions caused minor differences in the BCMC. For DNA extraction and purification, a mild lysis step (bead-beating for 10 s at 4 m/s or vortexing at 1800 rpm for 10 s) paired with the MagMAX Total kit and Proteinase K digestion provided the most accurate representation of the BCMC. Cell lysis procedures conferred the greatest changes to milk microbiota composition and these effects were confirmed to provide similar results for commercial milk samples. Overall, our systematic approach with the BCMC is broadly applicable to other milk, food, and environmental samples therefore recommended for improving accuracy of culture-independent, DNA sequence-based analyses of microbial composition in different habitats."

https://openalex.org/W4295898350,"Background Maternal nutrition is vital for an optimal intrauterine environment, foetal development, birth weight, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. We assessed the maternal dietary patterns using a data-driven technique and the associated sociodemographic factors among pregnant women in Ibadan, Nigeria. Methodology Dietary assessment was performed during the enrolment of participants for the Ibadan Pregnancy Cohort Study, a prospective cohort study, conducted among 1745 pregnant women enrolled early in pregnancy (≤ 20 weeks) at four comprehensive obstetric facilities within the Ibadan metropolis. A qualitative food frequency questionnaire was used to assess the pregnant population’s intake of food and drinks three months prior to their enrollment. We determined dietary patterns by applying principal component analysis with a varimax rotation. Multivariate analysis was used to investigate the association between sociodemographic factors and dietary patterns at 5% statistical significance. Results Mean age and gestational age at enrolment were 29.8 (± 5.3) years and 16.4 (±4.2) weeks, respectively. White rice was the most frequently consumed meal [794 (45.5%) daily, 898 (51.4%)] weekly in our study population. Five major dietary patterns were identified, and they accounted for 28.8% of the total variation: ""protein-rich diet with non-alcoholic beverages"" (15.6%); ""fruits"" (4.1%); ""typical diet with alcohol"" (3.8%); ""legumes"" (2.8%), ""refined grains"" (2.6%). Maternal education and income were inversely associated with the consumption of a ""protein-rich diet with non-alcoholic beverages"", ""typical diet with alcohol"", and ""legumes"" in a dose-response fashion. Also, employed women had a higher mean intake of fruits [adjusted β: 0.33 (0.02; 0.65) p = 0.040] compared with women without employment. Conclusions and recommendation We described five dietary patterns of pregnant women using a data-driven technique, principal component analysis, in Nigeria. We also identified factors influencing maternal dietary patterns, which can inform public health interventions, especially behavioural change communication during antenatal care."

Thus the proximate composition and glycaemic indices (GI) of raw, raw polished, and parboiled traditional Sri Lankan rice (Oryza sativa L.) varieties Godaheenati, Batapola el, Dik wee, Dahanala, Unakola samba, and Hangimuththan were studied as comparative data are not available. Cooked parboiled rice contained significantly high moisture (P<0.05) than raw or raw polished. Mineral content was low (<1.5%) regardless of processing. Crude protein was comparatively high (5.8-11.0% DM) with 2.1-5% (DM) fat with raw unpolished and parboiled having higher contents. Digestible starch of raw polished was highest compared to parboiled or raw unpolished (68.8-90.5% DM). Resistant starch was significantly (P<0.05) high in parboiled rice (1.1-7.2%) with the least total dietary fibre in raw polished rice. All varieties of parboiled and raw polished were found to elicit low GI and high GI respectively. High moisture, high resistant starch, and low starch in cooked parboiled rice contributed to low GI compared to raw unpolished or raw polished rice."

Statements were abstracted and coded pertaining to cognitive and communication barriers to LDKT, and the perceived value of using the videos to learn and share the information with social network members using content analysis. Incidence counts of each content code were also calculated to assess differences between Black and non-Black patients.Cognitive barrier codes included lack of knowledge, ambivalence, and concern for donor. Communication barrier codes included reluctance and difficulty talking about LDKT. Cognitive facilitating codes included attention-getting, efficient learning, manageable content, emotional impact, and new knowledge. Communication facilitating codes included delivery through many dissemination channels and broadly shareable. Compared to non-black patients (n = 33) Black patients (n = 29) more often stated concern for donor and reluctance/difficulty talking about LDKT as barriers, and less often stated efficient learning and manageable content as facilitators.Findings highlight the value of LDKT informational content that is visually appealing, digestible, non-threatening, and highly shareable. Heterogeneity may exist when considering access and intervention preferences in using KidneyTIME videos and highlight a potential for further cultural targeting or tailoring."

Nitric oxide (NO) is a multifunctional signalling molecule, acting as a vasodilator, neurotransmitter, and modulator of inflammatory processes. Patients with type II diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, controlled from glycaemic status, were treated or not with pulsed electrostatic field (PESF) cycles to evaluate effect on the perfusion of peripheral tissues. Everyone was monitored for the metabolic profile, and we tested circulating NO with a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit. In addition, we tested the perceived quality of life of patients before/after a PESF cycle using a questionnaire. Patients treated with PESF were improved circulating NO levels, significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and were more homogeneous for their metabolic profile. The questionnaire showed also a marked improvement in the perceived quality of life. The use of pulsed electrostatic fields has allowed us to observe an improvement in the metabolic, psychological, and clinical profile in patients with T2DM and chronic kidney disease whose pathological profile is strongly compromised."

Network Pain Rehabilitation Limburg, a transmural health care network, has been designed to provide integrated rehabilitation care from a biopsychosocial perspective to improve patients' levels of functioning. This feasibility study aims to provide insight into barriers and facilitators for the development, implementation, and transferability.This study was conducted with a three-phase iterative and incremental design from October 2017 to October 2018. The network comprises two rehabilitation practices, and three local primary care networks, with a general practitioner together with, a mental health practice nurse, and a physiotherapist or exercise therapist. These stakeholders with a random sample of participating patients took part in evaluations, consisting of interviews, focus groups, and observations. Field notes and observations were recorded during meetings. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research guided data collection and analysis. Results were used to refine the next phase.According to health care professionals, guidelines and treatment protocols facilitate consistency and transparency in collaboration, biopsychosocial language, and treatment. One mentioned barrier is the stigmatization of chronic pain by the general population. In regular care, approaches are often more biomedical than biopsychosocial, causing patients to resist participating. The current organization of health care acts as a barrier, complicating implementation between and within practices. Health care professionals were enthusiastic about the iterative, bottom-up development. A critical mass of participating organizations is needed for proper implementation.Network Pain Rehabilitation Limburg is feasible in daily practice if barriers are overcome and facilitators of development, implementation, and transferability are promoted. These findings will be used to refine Network Pain Rehabilitation Limburg. A large-scale process and effect evaluation will be performed.

In Ethiopia, different studies are done on the prevalence and determinants of breastfeeding initiation, up to our knowledge, the spatial distribution and the spatial determinants of breast feeding initiation over time are not investigated. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to assess spatial variation and its spatial determinant of delayed initiation of breastfeeding in Ethiopia using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR).A cross-sectional study was undertaken using the nationally representative 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) dataset. Global Moran's I statistic was used to measure whether delayed breastfeeding initiation was dispersed, clustered, or randomly distributed in study area. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was used to identify factors explaining the geographic variation in delayed breastfeeding initiation. Besides, spatial variability of relationships between dependent and selected predictors was investigated using geographically weighted regression.A total weighted sample of 4169 children of aged 0 to 23 months was included in this study. Delayed initiation of breastfeeding was spatially varies across the country with a global Moran's I value of 0.158 at (p-value<0.01). The hotspot (high risk) areas were identified in the Amhara, Afar, and Tigray regions.

https://openalex.org/W4295903715,"Cataract surgery impinges on the spatial properties and wavelength distribution of retinal images, which changes the degree of light-induced visual discomfort/photophobia. However, no study has analyzed the alteration in photophobia before and after cataract surgery or the association between retinal spatial property and photophobia. Here, we measured the higher-order aberrations (HOAs) of the entire eye and the subjective photophobia score. This study investigated 71 eyes in 71 patients who received conventional cataract surgery. Scaling of photophobia was based on the following grading system: when the patient is outdoor on a sunny day, score of 0 and 10 points were assigned to the absence of photophobia and the presence of severe photophobia prevents eye-opening, respectively. We decomposed wavefront errors using Zernike polynomials for a 3-mm pupil diameter and analyzed the association between photophobia scores and HOAs with Spearman’s rank sum correlation (rs). We classified patients into two groups: photophobia (PP) unconcerned included patients who selected 0 both preoperatively or postoperatively and PP concerned included the remaining patients. After cataract surgery, photophobia scores increased, remained unchanged (stable), and decreased in 3, 41, and 27 cases, respectively. In the stable group, 35 of 41 cases belonged to PP unconcerned. In PP concerned, there were significant correlations between photophobia score and postoperative root-mean-square values of total HOAs (rs = 0.52, p = 0.002), total coma (rs = 0.52, p = 0.002), total trefoil (rs = 0.47, p = 0.006), and third-order group (rs = 0.53, p = 0.002). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between photophobia scores and preoperative HOAs. Our results suggest that the spatial properties of retinal image modified by HOAs may affect the degree of photophobia. Scattering light due to cataracts could contribute to photophobia more than HOAs, which may mask the effect of HOAs for photophobia preoperatively."

https://openalex.org/W4295906001,"A computer tomography image (CI) sequence can be regarded as a time-series data that is composed of a great deal of nearby and similar CIs. Since the computational and I/O costs of similarity measure, encryption, and decryption calculation during a similarity retrieval of the large CI sequences (CIS) are extremely high, deploying all retrieval tasks in the cloud, however, will lead to excessive computing load on the cloud, which will greatly and negatively affect the retrieval performance.To tackle the above challenges, the paper proposes a progressive privacy-preserving Batch Retrieval scheme for the lung CISs based on edge-cloud collaborative computation called the BRS method. There are four supporting techniques to enable the BRS method, such as: 1) batch similarity measure for CISs, 2) CIB-based privacy preserving scheme, 3) uniform edge-cloud index framework, and 4) edge buffering.The experimental results reveal that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and scalability, drastically reducing response time by lowering network communication costs while enhancing retrieval safety and accuracy."
