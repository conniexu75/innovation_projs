https://openalex.org/W2791854743,"Liability to alcohol dependence (AD) is heritable, but little is known about its complex polygenic architecture or its genetic relationship with other disorders. To discover loci associated with AD and characterize the relationship between AD and other psychiatric and behavioral outcomes, we carried out the largest genome-wide association study to date of DSM-IV-diagnosed AD. Genome-wide data on 14,904 individuals with AD and 37,944 controls from 28 case-control and family-based studies were meta-analyzed, stratified by genetic ancestry (European, n = 46,568; African, n = 6,280). Independent, genome-wide significant effects of different ADH1B variants were identified in European (rs1229984; P = 9.8 × 10-13) and African ancestries (rs2066702; P = 2.2 × 10-9). Significant genetic correlations were observed with 17 phenotypes, including schizophrenia, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, depression, and use of cigarettes and cannabis. The genetic underpinnings of AD only partially overlap with those for alcohol consumption, underscoring the genetic distinction between pathological and nonpathological drinking behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2898304423,"According to predictive-coding theory, cortical areas continuously generate and update predictions of sensory inputs at different hierarchical levels and emit prediction errors when the predicted and actual inputs differ. However, predictions and prediction errors are simultaneous and interdependent processes, making it difficult to disentangle their constituent neural network organization. Here, we test the theory by using high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) in monkeys during an auditory ""local-global"" paradigm in which the temporal regularities of the stimuli were controlled at two hierarchical levels. We decomposed the broadband data and identified lower- and higher-level prediction-error signals in early auditory cortex and anterior temporal cortex, respectively, and a prediction-update signal sent from prefrontal cortex back to temporal cortex. The prediction-error and prediction-update signals were transmitted via γ (>40 Hz) and α/β (<30 Hz) oscillations, respectively. Our findings provide strong support for hierarchical predictive coding and outline how it is dynamically implemented using distinct cortical areas and frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2898267661,"Widefield imaging of calcium dynamics is an emerging method for mapping regional neural activity but is currently limited to restrained animals. Here we describe cScope, a head-mounted widefield macroscope developed to image large-scale cortical dynamics in rats during natural behavior. cScope provides a 7.8 × 4 mm field of view and dual illumination paths for both fluorescence and hemodynamic correction and can be fabricated at low cost using readily attainable components. We also report the development of Thy-1 transgenic rat strains with widespread neuronal expression of the calcium indicator GCaMP6f. We combined these two technologies to image large-scale calcium dynamics in the dorsal neocortex during a visual evidence accumulation task. Quantitative analysis of task-related dynamics revealed multiple regions having neural signals that encode behavioral choice and sensory evidence. Our results provide a new transgenic resource for calcium imaging in rats and extend the domain of head-mounted microscopes to larger-scale cortical dynamics. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2903069810,"Stimulants are considered the first-line treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in the US and they are used in other indications. Stimulants are also diverted for non-medical purposes. Ethnic and regional differences in ADHD diagnosis and in stimulant use have been identified in earlier research. The objectives of this report were to examine the pharmacoepidemiological pattern of these controlled substances over the past decade and to conduct a regional analysis.Data (drug weights) reported to the US Drug Enforcement Administration's Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System for four stimulants (amphetamine, methylphenidate, lisdexamfetamine, and methamphetamine) were obtained from 2006 to 2016 for Unites States/Territories. Correlations between state level use (mg/person) and Hispanic population were completed.Amphetamine use increased 2.5 fold from 2006 to 2016 (7.9 to 20.0 tons). Methylphenidate use, at 16.5 tons in 2006, peaked in 2012 (19.4 tons) and subsequently showed a modest decline (18.6 tons in 2016). The consumption per municipality significantly increased 7.6% for amphetamine and 5.5% for lisdexamfetamine but decreased 2.7% for methylphenidate (all p < .0005) from 2015 to 2016. Pronounced regional differences were also observed. Lisdexamfetamine use in 2016 was over thirty-fold higher in the Southern US (43.8 mg/person) versus the Territories (1.4 mg/person). Amphetamine use was about one-third lower in the West (48.1 mg/person) relative to the Northeastern (75.4 mg/person, p < .05) or the Midwestern (69.9 mg/person, p ≤ .005) states. States with larger Hispanic populations had significantly lower methylphenidate (r(49) = -0.63), lisdexamfetamine (B, r(49) = -0.49), and amphetamine (r(49) = -0.43) use.Total stimulant usage doubled in the last decade. There were dynamic changes but also regional disparities in the use of stimulant medications. Future research is needed to better understand the reasons for the sizable regional and ethnic variations in use of these controlled substances."
https://openalex.org/W2896513464,"Motor cortex (M1) exhibits a rich repertoire of neuronal activities to support the generation of complex movements. Although recent neuronal-network models capture many qualitative aspects of M1 dynamics, they can generate only a few distinct movements. Additionally, it is unclear how M1 efficiently controls movements over a wide range of shapes and speeds. We demonstrate that modulation of neuronal input–output gains in recurrent neuronal-network models with a fixed architecture can dramatically reorganize neuronal activity and thus downstream muscle outputs. Consistent with the observation of diffuse neuromodulatory projections to M1, a relatively small number of modulatory control units provide sufficient flexibility to adjust high-dimensional network activity using a simple reward-based learning rule. Furthermore, it is possible to assemble novel movements from previously learned primitives, and one can separately change movement speed while preserving movement shape. Our results provide a new perspective on the role of modulatory systems in controlling recurrent cortical activity. Many behavioral tasks require fast, reliable switching of the shape and duration of cortical activity. Stroud et al. show that modulation of neural excitability in recurrent network models provides flexible spatiotemporal control of neural activity."
https://openalex.org/W2900585348,"The mechanism of seizure emergence and the role of brief interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in seizure generation are two of the most important unresolved issues in modern epilepsy research. We found that the transition to seizure is not a sudden phenomenon, but is instead a slow process that is characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal network resilience. From a dynamical perspective, the slow transition is governed by the principles of critical slowing, a robust natural phenomenon that is observable in systems characterized by transitions between dynamical regimes. In epilepsy, this process is modulated by synchronous synaptic input from IEDs. IEDs are external perturbations that produce phasic changes in the slow transition process and exert opposing effects on the dynamics of a seizure-generating network, causing either anti-seizure or pro-seizure effects. We found that the multifaceted nature of IEDs is defined by the dynamical state of the network at the moment of the discharge occurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2901301756,"Heterogeneity in early language development in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is clinically important and may reflect neurobiologically distinct subtypes. Here, we identified a large-scale association between multiple coordinated blood leukocyte gene coexpression modules and the multivariate functional neuroimaging (fMRI) response to speech. Gene coexpression modules associated with the multivariate fMRI response to speech were different for all pairwise comparisons between typically developing toddlers and toddlers with ASD and poor versus good early language outcome. Associated coexpression modules were enriched in genes that are broadly expressed in the brain and many other tissues. These coexpression modules were also enriched in ASD-associated, prenatal, human-specific, and language-relevant genes. This work highlights distinctive neurobiology in ASD subtypes with different early language outcomes that is present well before such outcomes are known. Associations between neuroimaging measures and gene expression levels in blood leukocytes may offer a unique in vivo window into identifying brain-relevant molecular mechanisms in ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2902791508,"The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by combination of direct acting antivirals (DAA), with different mode of action, has made substantial progress in the past few years. However, appearance of resistance and high cost of the therapy is still an obstacle in the achievement of the therapy, more specifically in developing countries. In this context, search for affordable antivirals with new mechanisms of action is still needed. Tea, after water, is the most popular drink worldwide. Polyphenols extracted from green tea have already shown anti-HCV activity as entry inhibitors. Here, three different theaflavins, theaflavin (TF1), theaflavin-3’-monogallate (TF2), and theaflavin-3-3’-digallate (TF3), which are major polyphenols from black tea, were tested against HCV in cell culture. The results showed that all theaflavins inhibit HCV infection in a dose-dependent manner in an early step of infection. Results obtained with HCV pseudotyped virions confirmed their activity on HCV entry and demonstrated their pan-genotypic action. No effect on HCV replication was observed by using HCV replicon. Investigation on the mechanism of action of black tea theaflavins showed that they act directly on the virus particle and are able to inhibit cell-to-cell spread. Combination study with inhibitors most widely used in anti-HCV treatment regimen demonstrated that TF3 exerts additive effect. In conclusion, theaflavins, that are present in high quantity in black tea, are new inhibitors of HCV entry and hold promise for developing in therapeutic arsenal for HCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2903396681,"Purpose To investigate the suitability of multi-scale spatial information in 30o visual fields (VF), computed from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier, for early-glaucoma vs. control discrimination. Method Two data sets of VFs acquired with the OCTOPUS 101 G1 program and the Humphrey Field Analyzer 24–2 pattern were subdivided into control and early-glaucomatous groups, and converted into a new image using a novel voronoi representation to train a custom-designed CNN so to discriminate between control and early-glaucomatous eyes. Saliency maps that highlight what regions of the VF are contributing maximally to the classification decision were computed to provide classification justification. Model fitting was cross-validated and average precision (AP) score performances were computed for our method, Mean Defect (MD), square-root of Loss Variance (sLV), their combination (MD+sLV), and a Neural Network (NN) that does not use convolutional features. Results CNN achieved the best AP score (0.874±0.095) across all test folds for one data set compared to others (MD = 0.869±0.064, sLV = 0.775±0.137, MD+sLV = 0.839±0.085, NN = 0.843±0.089) and the third best AP score (0.986 ±0.019) on the other one with slight difference from the other methods (MD = 0.986±0.023, sLV = 0.992±0.016, MD+sLV = 0.987±0.017, NN = 0.985±0.017). In general, CNN consistently led to high AP across different data sets. Qualitatively, computed saliency maps appeared to provide clinically relevant information on the CNN decision for individual VFs. Conclusion The proposed CNN offers high classification performance for the discrimination of control and early-glaucoma VFs when compared with standard clinical decision measures. The CNN classification, aided by saliency visualization, may support clinicians in the automatic discrimination of early-glaucomatous and normal VFs."
https://openalex.org/W2902232396,"Large carnivores are often persecuted due to conflict with human activities, making their conservation in human-modified landscapes very challenging. Conflict-related scenarios are increasing worldwide, due to the expansion of human activities or to the recovery of carnivore populations. In general, brown bears Ursus arctos avoid humans and their settlements, but they may use some areas close to people or human infrastructures. Bear damages in human-modified landscapes may be related to the availability of food resources of human origin, such as beehives. However, the association of damage events with factors that may predispose bears to cause damages has rarely been investigated. We investigated bear damages to apiaries in the Cantabrian Mountains (Spain), an area with relatively high density of bears. We included spatial, temporal and environmental factors and damage prevention measures in our analyses, as factors that may influence the occurrence and intensity of damages. In 2006-2008, we located 61 apiaries, which included 435 beehives damaged in the study area (346 km2). The probability of an apiary being attacked was positively related to both the intensity of the damage suffered the year before and the distance to the nearest damaged apiary, and negatively related to the number of prevention measures employed as well as the intensity of the damage suffered by the nearest damage apiary. The intensity of damage to apiaries was positively related to the size of the apiary and to vegetation cover in the surroundings, and negatively related to the number of human settlements. Minimizing the occurrence of bear damages to apiaries seems feasible by applying and maintaining proper prevention measures, especially before an attack occurs and selecting appropriate locations for beehives (e.g. away from forest areas). This applies to areas currently occupied by bears, and to neighbouring areas where dispersing individuals may expand their range."
https://openalex.org/W2902298473,"Inhibitors of bromodomain and extra-terminal proteins (BETi) suppress oncogenic gene expression and have been shown to be efficacious in many in vitro and murine models of cancer, including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive disease. However, in most cancer models, responses to BETi can be highly variable. We previously reported that TNBC cells either undergo senescence or apoptosis in response to BETi, but the specific mechanisms dictating these two cell fates remain unknown. Using six human TNBC cell lines, we show that the terminal response of TNBC cells to BETi is dictated by the intrinsic expression levels of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-xL). BCL-xL levels were higher in cell lines that senesce in response to BETi compared with lines that primarily die in response to these drugs. Moreover, BCL-xL expression was further reduced in cells that undergo BETi-mediated apoptosis. Forced BCL-xL overexpression in cells that normally undergo apoptosis following BETi treatment shifted them to senescence without affecting the reported mechanism of action of BETi in TNBC, that is, mitotic catastrophe. Most importantly, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of BCL-xL induced apoptosis in response to BETi, and inhibiting BCL-xL, even after BETi-induced senescence had already occurred, still induced cell death. These results indicate that BCL-xL provides a senescent cell death–inducing or senolytic target that may be exploited to improve therapeutic outcomes of TNBC in response to BETi. They also suggest that the basal levels of BCL-xL should be predictive of tumor responses to BETi in current clinical trials.

https://openalex.org/W2902798493,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease characterized by cartilage damage and abnormal remodeling of subchondral bone. Our previous study showed that in the early stage of OA, knee loading exerts protective effects by suppressing osteoclastogenesis through Wnt signaling, but little is known about loading effects at the late OA stage. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy are known to be involved in the late OA stage. We determined the effects of mechanical loading on ER stress and autophagy in OA mice. One hundred seventy-four mice were used for a surgery-induced OA model. In the first set of experiments, 60 mice were devoted to evaluation of the role of ER stress and autophagy in the development of OA. In the second set, 114 mice were used to assess the effect of knee loading on OA. Histologic, cellular, microcomputed tomography, and electron microscopic analyses were performed to evaluate morphologic changes, ER stress, and autophagy. Mechanical loading increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and regulated expressions of autophagy markers LC3II/I and p62. Osteoarthritic mice also exhibited an elevated ratio of calcified cartilage to total articular cartilage (CC/TAC), and synovial hyperplasia with increased lining cells was found. At the early disease stage, subchondral bone plate thinning and reduced subchondral bone volume fraction (B.Ar/T.Ar) were observed. At the late disease stages, subchondral bone plate thickened concomitant with increased B.Ar/T.Ar. Mice subjected to mechanical loading exhibited resilience to cartilage destruction and a correspondingly reduced Osteoarthritis Research Society International score at 4 and 8 wk, as well as a decrease in synovitis and CC/TAC. While chondrocyte numbers in the OA group was notably decreased, mechanical loading restored chondrogenic differentiation. These results demonstrate that mechanical loading can retard the pathologic progression of OA at its early and late stages. The observed effects of loading are associated with the regulations of ER stress and autophagy.-Zheng, W., Li, X., Liu, D., Li, J., Yang, S., Gao, Z., Wang, Z., Yokota, H., Zhang, P. Mechanical loading mitigates osteoarthritis symptoms by regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy."

Nitric oxide (NO) has modulatory functions in many neuronal and neurovascular circuits (Garthwaite, 2008Garthwaite J. Concepts of neural nitric oxide-mediated transmission.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 27: 2783-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). In the retina, its effects have been most closely associated with circuit reconfigurations to support transitions across light levels. NO increases the gain of cone synapses in the outer retina (Snellman and Nawy, 2004Snellman J. Nawy S. cGMP-dependent kinase regulates response sensitivity of the mouse on bipolar cell.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6621-6628Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and acts through a variety of pathways in the inner retina. NO has been shown to reduce the conductance of gap junctions between AII amacrine cells and cone bipolar cells that are required for scotopic signals (Mills and Massey, 1995Mills S.L. Massey S.C. Differential properties of two gap junctional pathways made by AII amacrine cells.Nature. 1995; 377: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and increase the gain of cone bipolar cell synapses that carry photopic signals (Tooker et al., 2013Tooker R.E.

Despite much information about the effects of NO in the retina, very little is known about the cells and stimulus conditions controlling its release, primarily because we have lacked measurements from NO-releasing amacrine cells (ACs) (NOACs). Dopamine is another neuromodulator involved in light adaptation in the retina, and our understanding of dopaminergic ACs provides a point of comparison for the differences between these two modulators and the gaps in our knowledge about NO release. Dopamine levels in the retina fluctuate gradually with the circadian cycle (Nir et al., 2000Nir I. Haque R. Iuvone P.M. Diurnal metabolism of dopamine in the mouse retina.Brain Res. 2000; 870: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Dopaminergic ACs are tonically spiking (Puopolo et al., 2001Puopolo M.

In contrast, NO levels measured either in vivo or in vitro increase rapidly under photopic conditions, and flickering light is more effective than constant illumination at triggering NO release (Blom et al., 2012Blom J.

Functional measurements from NOACs would provide insights into the dynamic control of NO and the mechanisms by which it differs from dopamine. We show that a single NOAC, called the nNOS-2 AC, dominates NO production in the inner retina; depolarizing single nNOS-2 ACs leads to NO release. We report the light responses, electrical properties, and calcium dynamics that drive NO release in these cells. The most striking feature of nNOS-2 ACs is that they are massively and homologously coupled in a dense gap junction network. We discovered that coupling strength in the nNOS-2 AC network is dynamically regulated by light and can alter the input resistance of the ACs. Light-driven decoupling in the nNOS-2 network relies on NO, constituting a self-regulatory loop. Using a biophysical model of the nNOS-2 AC network, we explore the specializations in the nNOS-2 AC circuit, like high neurite resistivity and large gap junction conductance, that enable decoupling to alter network excitability. We used the nNOS-Cre transgenic mouse line to target NOACs for physiological and morphological measurements. A previous study identified two morphological types of ACs labeled in this line (Zhu et al., 2014Zhu Y. Xu J. Hauswirth W.W. DeVries S.H. Genetically targeted binary labeling of retinal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 7845-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although nNOS-1 ACs resemble a spiking polyaxonal cell type termed the A1 AC (Badea and Nathans, 2004Badea T.C. Nathans J.

Physiology of the A1 amacrine: a spiking, axon-bearing interneuron of the macaque monkey retina.Vis. Neurosci. 1997; 14: 507-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we focused on nNOS-2 ACs because they morphologically resemble cells that have been characterized as immunoreactive for nNOS in the rat retina (Pang et al., 2010Pang J.-J. Gao F. Wu S.M. Light responses and morphology of bNOS-immunoreactive neurons in the mouse retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2010; 518: 2456-2474PubMed Google Scholar), but nothing is known about their physiology in mouse. We targeted nNOS-2 ACs under two-photon laser illumination and identified them by fluorescence labeling (tdTomato expression in the Ai9 reporter line). Although nNOS-2 ACs were the minority of cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) labeled in this line, we used their characteristic morphology to target them for whole-cell recordings. A single neurite “neck” emanates from the soma of the nNOS-2 AC and bifurcates near the middle of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). In initial experiments to characterize the morphology of nNOS-2 ACs, we filled the cells with neurobiotin. A single nNOS-2 AC filled with neurobiotin under dark conditions revealed a vast gap junction network of morphologically similar cells (Figure 1A; 44 ± 3 coupled cells, n = 6 injections from different retinas). Among all coupled cells, 7% ± 0.3% were located in the GCL, whereas 93% ± 2% were located in the inner nuclear layer (INL) (16 GCL somata + 201 INL somata from 217 total coupled nNOS-2 ACs counted; n = 5 retinas). In addition to their similar morphology, every coupled cell was both positive for tdTomato in the nNOS-Cre reporter line and positive for an antibody against nNOS (Figure S1), providing additional evidence that the coupled network only included nNOS-2 ACs. Blocking gap junctions with meclofenamic acid (MFA) allowed us to reconstruct the morphology of individual nNOS-2 ACs. The reconstructed single cells had long, very sparsely branching neurites in the middle of the IPL, consistent with a previous report (Figure 1B; Zhu et al., 2014Zhu Y. Xu J. Hauswirth W.W. DeVries S.H. Genetically targeted binary labeling of retinal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 7845-7861Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Remarkably, gap junctions between nNOS-2 ACs passed not only the small tracer molecule neurobiotin (322 g/mol) but also passed Alexa Fluor 488, a molecule of nearly twice the molecular weight (580 g/mol; Figure 1C). The large molecule permeability and extent of the filled network suggested a very large gap-junctional conductance and was further explored in experiments and modeling below. We used antibodies to different connexin proteins to determine which subtypes form the structural hemichannels in the nNOS-2 AC network. Connexin 36 (Cx36) and Cx45 are both prevalent in the inner retina (Figures S2B and S2C), so we tested for the presence of both hemichannel proteins at crossings between nNOS-2 AC neurites. Cx36 was not observed at these crossings (Figure S2A), but Cx45 was indeed present (Figure 1D). We observed Cx45 puncta in 48% (11 of 23) of putatively “touching” neurites (that crossed within the same focal plane) (Figures 1Di and 1Diii). Neurites that did not touch (4–12 μm separation in the z axis) showed either a complete absence of puncta or Cx45 puncta registered in a different plane (Figure 1Dii). Rotating the Cx45 channel in the image by 90° as a negative control eliminated all but one of the colocalized puncta (Figure 1E). Under the assumption that the Cx45-containing crossings represent gap junctions, we estimate their density to be ∼200/mm2. We tested for functional coupling between nNOS-2 ACs using paired recordings (Figure 2). We used Alexa Fluor 488 permeability to help us identify coupled cells and target them for paired recordings. When an nNOS-2 AC in the GCL was patched and filled with Alexa Fluor 488, a neighboring soma in the GCL could be targeted using two-photon fluorescence and patched with a second electrode (Figure 2A; STAR Methods). A total of 4 nNOS-2 AC pairs were recorded, and each pair showed bidirectional electrical coupling with a characteristically linear current-voltage function passing through the origin (Figures 2B–2D). Gap junctions between nNOS-2 ACs showed little voltage dependence in their conductance because the trans-junctional current-voltage relationship was linear over the physiological range of membrane potential fluctuations of the injected cell (Figures 2B–2D). The coupling coefficient measured with somatic current injections was 7.5% ± 0.4%, with a shallow dependence on the distance between somata (Figure 2E). To assess their light responses, we recorded nNOS-2 ACs in current clamp configuration. These cells had a resting membrane potential of −61 ± 2 mV (n = 16) in darkness. Upon presentation of a light spot of 200 rod isomerizations (R∗)/rod/s, measuring 200 μm in diameter, nNOS-2 ACs depolarized by 28 ± 1 mV (n = 16) at light onset (Figure 3A). We then recorded their responses to light steps of 100% contrast across a range of light levels (Figure 3B). With steps of increasing luminance, their responses increased in amplitude, decreased in latency, and developed an OFF response (Figures 3B and 3C). Despite wide-field morphology typical of spiking ACs, we never observed action potentials in nNOS-2 ACs, either with light stimuli or with depolarizing current injections (Figure 3D). Although the resting membrane potential of nNOS-2 ACs adapted rapidly to steps in mean illumination, the cell responded robustly to a photopic stimulus flickering at 3 Hz (Figure 3E), a paradigm previously shown to elicit NO release in the retina (Blom et al., 2012Blom J.

NO synthesis is initiated in nNOS-expressing neurons via direct interaction of calcium with nNOS-bound calmodulin following depolarization (McMurry et al., 2011McMurry J.L. Chrestensen C.A.

Charles S.L. Chess-Williams R. Endothelium-derived relaxing factor release on activation of NMDA receptors suggests role as intercellular messenger in the brain.Nature. 1988; 336: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (2276) Google Scholar). Unlike traditional neurotransmitters, NO diffuses freely across cell membranes, so its release depends only on its rate of synthesis (Garthwaite, 2008Garthwaite J. Concepts of neural nitric oxide-mediated transmission.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 27: 2783-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). We sought to measure the voltage dependence of calcium influx in nNOS-2 ACs to give us insights into the conditions under which the light-evoked depolarizations we measured could lead to NO release. There are, of course, possible sources of calcium influx into nNOS-2 ACs other than voltage-gated calcium channels (like N-methyl D-aspartate [NMDA] receptors or calcium-permeable AMPA receptors), but we focused on the voltage-driven calcium influx because we could isolate the currents pharmacologically from any possible network effects of receptor blockers, and we measured robust signals in the physiological voltage range of the cell that are likely responsible for the majority of light-driven calcium influx. In the first set of experiments, we depolarized nNOS-2 ACs with current injections and measured changes in the fluorescence of the calcium indicator Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (OGB-1) (Figure 4A). Unlike in spiking neurons, calcium changes were absent at the somata but were apparent in the neurites (Figures 4B and 4C). We chose a proximal location on the primary neurite where we observed maximal response amplitude and elicited a series of depolarizations in current clamp configuration. Our measurements revealed a steep, nonlinear dependence of calcium influx on voltage with a high activation threshold (Figure 4D; half-maximal voltage [Vhalf] = −27.4 ± 0 mV, slope = 6.1 ± 0, n = 3). In a second set of experiments, we measured Ca2+ currents in nNOS-2 ACs. We voltage-clamped the cells and measured their current-voltage relationships under control conditions (in the presence of synaptic blockers) and in the presence of cobalt (5 mM) to block Ca2+ currents (Figures 4E and 4F). We then subtracted the current traces in cobalt from those in the control to isolate Ca2+ currents driven through voltage-gated channels by our depolarizations (Raman and Bean, 1999Raman I.M. Bean B.P. Ionic currents underlying spontaneous action potentials in isolated cerebellar Purkinje neurons.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1663-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Surprenant et al., 1990Surprenant A. Shen K.Z. North R.A. Tatsumi H. Inhibition of calcium currents by noradrenaline, somatostatin and opioids in guinea-pig submucosal neurones.J. Physiol. 1990; 431: 585-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because of their wide-field morphology and the extensive coupling between nNOS-2 ACs, space-clamp issues were likely present in these voltage-clamp experiments. However, the effects of poor space-clamping in measuring voltage-dependent calcium currents are mitigated by the fact that the well-clamped channels in the proximal neurites (the same place we measured in our imaging experiments) are the ones providing most of the current. The large coupling coefficients measured in pairs of cells hundreds of microns apart (Figure 2E) also suggest that nNOS-2 ACs have an unusually long electrotonic length constant, as confirmed by the modeling results below. Despite the technical differences between our two calcium measurements and the caveats of voltage-clamping in these cells, the measurements agreed remarkably well in the shape of the activation curve (Figure 4G; Figures S3A and S3B; for calcium currents, Vhalf = −29.6 ± 0.2 mV, slope = 6.6 ± 0, n = 3). Calcium currents showed fast inactivation with a decay time constant of less than 70 ms (Figures S3C and S3D). Based on these activation curves, a substantial (∼30 mV) depolarization is required for large calcium influx. This may serve as a thresholding mechanism so that calcium entry only occurs for large light responses, such as those elicited by bright flicker (Figure 3F; Discussion). To test directly whether nNOS-2 ACs release NO, we injected current into individual cells during whole-cell recordings in the presence of the unipolar, NO-sensitive, fluorescent dye 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7’-difluorofluorescein diacetate (DAF) (Kojima et al., 1999Kojima H. Urano Y. Kikuchi K. Higuchi T. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Fluorescent Indicators for Imaging Nitric Oxide Production.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 3209-3212Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar; Figure 5). Whole retinas were bath-loaded by incubation in DAF-containing solution, resulting in DAF being taken up by the entire retinal cell matrix. DAF only becomes fluorescent when it is exposed to NO and does not diminish unless bleached; stained tissue that is not exposed to NO remains non-fluorescent. Of note, both stimulated and unstimulated conditions were used in parallel, with a cell patched in one half of a retinal whole mount receiving current injection pulses, whereas a cell patched in the other half of the retina was left unstimulated. Using confocal microscopy, we observed a sharp increase in NO levels (via increases in DAF fluorescence) both in the soma and neurites of the injected nNOS-2 AC as well as in nearby somata of coupled cells via depolarization through gap junction coupling. All somata labeled by DAF were also labeled by neurobiotin and tdTomato in the nNOS-Cre reporter line, confirming their identity as nNOS-2 ACs (Figure 5A). We quantified the spatial decay of the DAF signal both in coupled somata (Figure 5C) and in the neurites of the injected cell (Figure 5D). The decays were well fit by single exponentials with length constants of 130 μm for somata and 303 μm for neurites. The presence of brightly labeled blood vessels provides evidence that DAF was indeed measuring NO because the vascular epithelium releases its own NO through endothelial NOS (eNOS). We repeated these experiments in perforated patch configuration to ensure that we were not unphysiologically altering the calcium buffering capacity in nNOS-2 ACs. Cells depolarized in perforated patch (n = 2) elicited similar NO responses as the cells depolarized in whole-cell configuration. Experiments were performed in heterozygous mice in which Cre was knocked into the nNOS locus, so these animals are expected to have less nNOS than wild-type (WT) mice. Therefore, this widespread NO release upon depolarization of a single nNOS-2 AC is a conservative estimate of NO release from this cell. Inhibiting NOS throughout the retina with Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) largely prevented the injected AC from synthesizing NO, and we observed only a weak DAF signal in the injected soma and no signal in its neurites or in other somata (Figures 5B–5D). We observed similarly diminished fluorescence in the blood vessels, consistent with the action of L-NAME as a blocker of both eNOS and nNOS. Both nNOS-1 and nNOS-2 ACs are immunopositive for nNOS (Figure S1), so we performed the same NO imaging experiments while depolarizing nNOS-1 ACs. We observed minimal DAF signals in the dendrites and axons of nNOS-1 ACs, similar to the L-NAME condition in nNOS-2 ACs (Figure S4), suggesting that nNOS-2 ACs are the main NO source of the inner retina. To relate the NO release driven by nNOS-2 ACs back to their light responses, we replicated previous results on flicker-induced increases in NO. We found that NO levels increased dramatically in the IPL with flickering light in the photopic regime but not with constant illumination at the same mean level (Figure S5). As a positive control to verify that DAF detects NO, we applied the exogenous NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). The peak location of NO release in the IPL with light flicker was consistent with the location of nNOS-2 AC neurites. A molecular pathway connecting NO to gap junction conductance has been identified previously. The NO receptor soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) catalyzes formation of the effector molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). The cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) then phosphorylates Cx45 gap junctions, reducing their conductance (Lu and McMahon, 1997Lu C. McMahon D.G. Modulation of hybrid bass retinal gap junctional channel gating by nitric oxide.J. Physiol. 1997; 499: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We confirmed that nNOS-2 ACs contain sGC (Figure S6), so we next asked whether NO could modulate the nNOS-2 AC gap junction network, perhaps through this same molecular pathway (Figure 6). We first tested the luminance dependence of nNOS-2 AC coupling using a bright, full-field flicker stimulus. Light flicker reduced the coupled network from 44 ± 3 to 21 ± 3 cells (Figures 6A and 6B; n = 6 dark, n = 4 networks). To determine whether coupling depends on NO, we applied SNAP, which reduced tracer coupling to 3 ± 1 cells (Figure 6C; n = 5). Application of the gap junction blocker MFA eliminated all coupling, leaving only an isolated cell filled with neurobiotin (Figure 6D; n = 4). To confirm that the flicker-induced decoupling of nNOS-2 ACs relied on NO synthesis, we inhibited NOS with L-NAME and repeated the flicker experiments. In the presence of L-NAME, light flicker was unable to decouple the network, and we measured a similar number of coupled cells as in the dark (Figure 6E; n = 6 dark, n = 4 L-NAME). To study how the changes we observed in anatomical coupling might affect the electrical properties of the network, we measured the input resistance of nNOS-2 ACs across the same set of conditions in which we measured tracer coupling. Decreases in coupling should correspond to reduced gap junction conductance throughout the network, increasing input resistance (Figure 6G). In the dark, the input resistance of a single cell was 180 ± 14 megaohms (MΩ) (n = 17 cells). In accordance with our tracer coupling results, the resistance increased to 230 ± 8 MΩ (n = 4) after light flicker. Separately, perfusion of SNAP over the tissue increased the resistance to 270 ± 37 MΩ (n = 4). Finally, we obtained the resistance of individual nNOS-2 ACs (526 ± 60 MΩ, n = 4) isolated from the network via complete block of gap junctions in MFA. Each resistance measurement was significantly different from the value in darkness (Figure 6G, right). We interpret the magnitude of the input resistance changes in the context of a model of the network below. We also measured the kinetics of input resistance changes induced by light flicker (Figure 7). In four cells, we made baseline resistance measurements in darkness and then re-measured at 1-min intervals following the same light flicker stimulus described previously. Input resistance increased rapidly in all 4 cells. The average resistance increase was well fit by a sigmoid with an amplitude of 84 MΩ and a half-maximal timescale of 2.1 min. Having established that electrical coupling in the nNOS-2 AC network is modulated by light through NO, we wanted to explore the biophysical properties of the neurons and their gap junctions that could account for our recorded data. We used a cable model in the NEURON simulation environment (Hines and Carnevale, 1997Hines M.L. Carnevale N.T. The NEURON simulation environment.Neural Comput. 1997; 9: 1179-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1851) Google Scholar) to link our anatomical and physiological measurements of the nNOS-2 AC network. We modeled a network of 36 gap junction-coupled nNOS-2 ACs (Figure 8A; Figures S7A–S7D). The densities of somata, neurites, and gap junctions in the model were taken from our anatomical measurements (Table S1), and both individual cell and network parameters of model construction were tested for robustness across wide ranges of values (Figures S7E–-S7L). Details of the model construction are given in the STAR Methods, and all parameters are listed in Table S1. A key unknown from our experiments was the conductance of each gap junction connection. We varied the gap junction conductance in the model to study its effect on two measured properties, input resistance and coupling coefficient, both modeled with somatic current injections to match our experiments. Input resistance was tightly linked to gap junction conductance with little variation across 10 different instantiations of the network (Figure 8D; SD in the shaded region). Because of the steep nonlinearity of this relationship, the modest 23% increase in input resistance we observed between dark and light flicker conditions corresponds to a 55% reduction in gap junction conductance, from 4.4 nS to 2.0 nS. With the gap junction conductance fixed at 4.4 nS to match the input resistance we measured in the dark, we modeled the coupling coefficient from a single central cell (#21 in Figure 8A) to each other cell in the network. Although the coupling coefficients in the model were consistent with our measurements, they were highly variable based on the number and location of connections between the two cells. The shallow dependence of the coupling coefficient on the distance between somata in the network matched our paired whole-cell measurements (Figure 8C). One reason for this discrepancy in variance could be that we targeted pairs for recording based on the transmission of Alexa Fluor 488; this likely biased us toward highly coupled cells. Additionally, it is possible that the real nNOS-2 AC network constrains this variability by creating a more uniform distribution of the number of gap junctions between each pair of cells than we modeled"

We hypothesized that HRVI causes differential DNA methylation and subsequently differential mRNA expression in epithelial cells of children with asthma. Primary nasal epithelial cells from children with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) asthma were cultivated up to passage two and infected with Rhinovirus-16 (RV-16). HRVI-induced genome-wide differences of DNA methylation in asthmatics (vs. controls) and resulting mRNA expression were analyzed by the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip Kit (Illumina) and RNA sequencing. These results were further verified by pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR, respectively. 471 CpGs belonging to 268 genes were identified to have HRVI-induced asthma-specifically modified DNA methylation and mRNA expression. A minimum-change criteria was applied to restrict assessment of genes with changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression of at least 3% and least 0.1 reads/kb per million mapped reads, respectively. Using this approach we identified 16 CpGs, including HLA-B-associated transcript 3 (BAT3) and Neuraminidase 1 (NEU1), involved in host immune response against HRVI. HRVI in nasal epithelial cells leads to specific modifications of DNA methylation with altered mRNA expression in children with asthma. The HRVI-induced alterations in DNA methylation occurred in genes involved in the host immune response against viral infections and asthma pathogenesis. The findings of our pilot study may partially explain how HRVI contribute to the persistence and progression of asthma, and aid to identify possible new therapeutic targets. The promising findings of this pilot study would benefit from replication in a larger cohort."

Moderate levels of walking are known to be of benefit to the psychosocial well-being of those affected by breast cancer and for managing cognitive impairment in healthy adults, children, and the elderly. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a home-based, self-managed, moderate intensity walking intervention on subjective and objective cognitive functioning in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods A home-based, self-managed intervention that consisted of moderate levels of walking was compared to usual care among breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy in a randomised controlled trial. Outcome measures included changes in subjective (CFQ) and objectively detected cognitive functioning (Stroop, SART and two subscales from the WAIS- Digit Span and Block Design). Fifty participants were randomised to either the intervention group (n = 25), who completed 12 weeks of moderate intensity walking, or to the control group (n = 25) mid-way through chemotherapy. Results Compared with the control group, the self-managed walking intervention had positive effects on perceived cognitive function but not on sustained attention, executive function, memory or visual spatial skills when assessed objectively using neuropsychological measures. Conclusion This home-based, self-managed intervention is beneficial for protecting against perceived cognitive decline in breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. There is a need for further research to objectively assess cognitive decline within this population with larger sample sizes of patients. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN50709297"
https://openalex.org/W2903051467,"The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) is a multienzyme assembly that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. As pyruvate and acetyl-CoA play central roles in cellular metabolism, understanding PDC regulation is pivotal to understanding the larger metabolic network. The activity of mammalian PDC is regulated through reversible phosphorylation governed by at least four isozymes of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Deciphering which kinase regulates PDC in organisms at specific times or places has been challenging. In this study, we analyzed mouse strains carrying targeted mutations of individual isozymes to explore their role in regulating PDC activity. Analysis of protein content of PDK isozymes in major metabolic tissues revealed that PDK1 and PDK2 were ubiquitously expressed, whereas PDK3 and PDK4 displayed a rather limited tissue distribution. Measurement of kinase activity showed that PDK1 is the principal isozyme regulating hepatic PDC. PDK2 was largely responsible for inactivation of PDC in tissues of muscle origin and brown adipose tissue (BAT). PDK3 was the principal kinase regulating pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in kidney and brain. In a well-fed state, the tissue levels of PDK4 protein were fairly low. In most tissues tested, PDK4 ablation had little effect on the overall rates of inactivation of PDC in kinase reaction. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the activity of PDC is regulated by different isozymes in different tissues. Furthermore, it appears that the overall flux through PDC in a given tissue largely reflects the properties of the PDK isozyme that is principally responsible for the regulation of PDC activity in that tissue."

Alterations in the quantity or quality of secreted mucins are therefore detrimental to airway and colon physiology. Based on various biochemical assays in several human cell lines, we report here that Na+/Ca2+ exchanger 2 (NCX2) works in conjunction with transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 4 (TRPM4), and perhaps TRPM5, Na+ channels to control Ca2+-mediated secretion of both mucin 2 (MUC2) and MUC5AC from HT29-18N2 colonic cancer cells. Differentiated normal bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and tracheal cells from patients with cystic fibrosis (CFT1-LC3) expressed only TRPM4 and all three isoforms of NCXs. Blocking the activity of TRPM4 or NCX proteins abrogated MUC5AC secretion from NHBE and CFT1-LC3 cells. Altogether, our findings reveal that NCX and TRPM4/TRPM5 are both required for mucin secretion. We therefore propose that these two proteins could be potential pharmacological targets to control mucus-related pathologies such as cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2902281329,"Background Despite the universalization of immunization against the six vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), the coverage of full immunization among the children under age five has remained a challenge globally. The 2015–16 National Family Health Survey (NFHS) indicated large disparity in the coverage of different vaccination doses (BCG, Polio, DPT and Measles) including full immunization across the districts of India. The spatial distribution of poor performing districts in terms of vaccination and the district level spatial, contextual determinants contributing to the low coverage have been poorly studied. Using the recent household survey (NFHS, 2015–16), this study examined the spatial heterogeneity and the factors associated with low vaccination coverage among the children aged 12–23 months across India. Data and methods This study used the data from fourth round of National Family Health Survey conducted in 2015–16. District-level prevalence of each of the vaccination doses including full immunization, were analysed. Moran’s I, Univariate and Bivariate LISA, Ordinary least square (OLS) and spatial models were employed to achieve the overall aim of the study. Results At the national level, the prevalence of full immunization was 62 percent. Specific vaccination coverage for BCG, three doses of polio, three doses of DPT and measles were 92, 73, 78 and 81 percent, respectively. The value of the bivariate Moran’s I statistics confirmed the spatial dependence between specific vaccination and the set of independent variables. District-level prevalence of the specific vaccine and full immunization showed significant spatial clustering across India. The adjusted coefficients from the spatial error model confirmed that district-level proportion of utilization of post-natal care, institutional births, neonatal tetanus protection of the last birth, women’s education and coverage of health insurance showed statistically significant association with every doses of vaccination coverage. Conclusion The full and specific immunization coverage was considerably low in the geographical hotspots as compared to the national coverage. Maternal and child health care services utilization, financial assistance to the mothers through JSY scheme and mother’s education were found to determine full immunization as well as the specific vaccination coverage. Appropriate intervention should be designed to reduce the geographical disparity in the coverage of specific and full immunization across India and thus safeguard child health protecting the children from the vaccine preventable diseases across the geography."

https://openalex.org/W2902723926,"The peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall is an essential extracytoplasmic glycopeptide polymer that safeguards bacteria against osmotic lysis and determines cellular morphology. Bacteria use multiprotein machineries for the synthesis of the PG cell wall during cell division and elongation that can be targeted by antibiotics such as the β-lactams. Lipid II, the lipid-linked precursor for PG biogenesis, is synthesized in the inner leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane and then translocated across the bilayer, where it is ultimately polymerized into PG. In Escherichia coli, MurJ, a member of the MOP exporter superfamily, has been recently shown to have lipid II flippase activity that depends on membrane potential. Because of its essentiality, MurJ could potentially be targeted by much needed novel antibiotics. Recent structural information suggests that a central cavity in MurJ alternates between inward- and outward-open conformations to flip lipid II, but how these conformational changes occur are unknown. Here, we utilized structure-guided cysteine cross-linking and proteolysis-coupled gel analysis to probe the conformational changes of MurJ in E. coli cells. We found that paired cysteine substitutions in transmembrane domains 2 and 8 and periplasmic loops of MurJ could be cross-linked with homobifunctional cysteine cross-linkers, indicating that MurJ can adopt both inward- and outward-facing conformations in vivo. Furthermore, we show that dissipating the membrane potential with an ionophore decreases the prevalence of the inward-facing, but not the outward-facing state. Our study provides in vivo evidence that MurJ uses an alternating-access mechanism during the lipid II transport cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2898268392,"Drugs of abuse, like alcohol, modulate gene expression in reward circuits and consequently alter behavior. However, the in vivo cellular mechanisms through which alcohol induces lasting transcriptional changes are unclear. We show that Drosophila Notch/Su(H) signaling and the secreted fibrinogen-related protein Scabrous in mushroom body (MB) memory circuitry are important for the enduring preference of cues associated with alcohol’s rewarding properties. Alcohol exposure affects Notch responsivity in the adult MB and alters Su(H) targeting at the dopamine-2-like receptor (Dop2R). Alcohol cue training also caused lasting changes to the MB nuclear transcriptome, including changes in the alternative splicing of Dop2R and newly implicated transcripts like Stat92E. Together, our data suggest that alcohol-induced activation of the highly conserved Notch pathway and accompanying transcriptional responses in memory circuitry contribute to addiction. Ultimately, this provides mechanistic insight into the etiology and pathophysiology of alcohol use disorder."

Taking advantage of linguistic information available through Facebook, we study the process of inferring a new set of potential human traits based on unprompted language use. We subject these new traits to a comprehensive set of evaluations and compare them with a popular five factor model of personality. We find that our language-based trait construct is often more generalizable in that it often predicts non-questionnaire-based outcomes better than questionnaire-based traits (e.g. entities someone likes, income and intelligence quotient), while the factors remain nearly as stable as traditional factors. Our approach suggests a value in new constructs of personality derived from everyday human language use."
https://openalex.org/W2902771081,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether damage to the neurovascular unit in diabetes depends on reactive metabolites such as methylglyoxal (MG), and to assess its impact on retinal gene expression. Male Wistar rats were supplied with MG (50 mM) by drinking water and compared with age-matched streptozotocin-diabetic animals and untreated controls. Retinal damage was evaluated for the accumulation of MG-derived advanced glycation end products, changes in hexosamine and PKC pathway activation, microglial activation, vascular alterations (pericyte loss and vasoregression), neuroretinal function assessed by electroretinogram, and neurodegeneration. Retinal gene regulation was studied by microarray analysis, and transcription factor involvement was identified by upstream regulator analysis. Systemic application of MG by drinking water increased retinal MG to levels comparable with diabetic animals. Elevated retinal MG resulted in MG-derived hydroimidazolone modifications in the ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer, and outer nuclear layer, a moderate activation of the hexosamine pathway, a pan-retinal activation of microglia, loss of pericytes, increased formation of acellular capillaries, decreased function of bipolar cells, and increased expression of the crystallin gene family. MG mimics important aspects of diabetic retinopathy and plays a pathogenic role in microglial activation, vascular damage, and neuroretinal dysfunction.

https://openalex.org/W2898574929,"In the developing brain, heightened plasticity during the critical period enables the proper formation of neural circuits. Here, we identify the ""navigator"" neurons, a group of perinatally born olfactory sensory neurons, as playing an essential role in establishing the olfactory map during the critical period. The navigator axons project circuitously in the olfactory bulb and traverse multiple glomeruli before terminating in perspective glomeruli. These neurons undergo a phase of exuberant axon growth and exhibit a shortened lifespan. Single-cell transcriptome analyses reveal distinct molecular signatures for the navigators. Extending their lifespan prolongs the period of exuberant growth and perturbs axon convergence. Conversely, a genetic ablation experiment indicates that, despite postnatal neurogenesis, only the navigators are endowed with the ability to establish a convergent map. The presence and the proper removal of the navigator neurons are both required to establish tight axon convergence into the glomeruli."
https://openalex.org/W2902726355,"Objective CD14 is a monocyte/macrophage pattern-recognition receptor that modulates innate inflammatory signaling. Soluble CD14 levels in knee OA synovial fluids are associated with symptoms and progression of disease. Here we investigate the role of this receptor in development of OA using a murine joint injury model of disease. Methods 10-week-old Male C57BL/6 (WT) and CD14-deficient (CD14-/-) mice underwent destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery to induce OA. Joint histopathology was used to examine cartilage damage, and microCT to evaluate subchondral bone (SCB) remodeling at 6 and 19 weeks after surgery. Synovial and fat pad expression of macrophage markers (F4/80, CD11c, CD68, iNOS, CCR7, CD163 and CD206) was assessed by flow cytometry and droplet digital (dd)PCR. Changes in locomotive activity indicative of joint pain were evaluated longitudinally up to 16 weeks by automated behavioral analysis. Results Early cartilage damage scores 6 weeks post-DMM were similar in both strains (Mean score ±SEM WT: 4.667±1.38, CD14-/-: 4.6±0.6), but at 19 weeks were less severe in CD14-/- (6.0±0.46) than in WT mice (13.44±2.5, p = 0.0002). CD14-/- mice were protected from both age-related and post-surgical changes in SCB mineral density and trabecular thickness. In addition, CD14-/- mice were protected from decreases in climbing activity (p = 0.015 vs. WT, 8 weeks) observed after DMM. Changes in synovial/fat pad expression of CCR7, a marker of M1 macrophages, were slightly reduced post-DMM in the absence of CD14, while expression of CD68 (pan-macrophage marker) and CD163 (M2 marker) were unchanged. Conclusion CD14 plays an important role in progression of structural and functional features of OA in the DMM model, and may provide a new target for therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W2902365759,"AS160 and Tbc1d1 are key Rab GTPase–activating proteins (RabGAPs) that mediate release of static GLUT4 in response to insulin or exercise-mimetic stimuli, respectively, but their cooperative regulation and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. By employing GLUT4 nanometry with cell-based reconstitution models, we herein analyzed the functional cooperative activities of the RabGAPs. When both RabGAPs are present, Tbc1d1 functionally dominates AS160, and stimuli-inducible GLUT4 release relies on Tbc1d1-evoking proximal stimuli, such as AICAR and intracellular Ca2+. Detailed functional assessments with varying expression ratios revealed that AS160 modulates sensitivity to external stimuli in Tbc1d1-mediated GLUT4 release. For example, Tbc1d1-governed GLUT4 release triggered by Ca2+ plus insulin occurred more efficiently than that in cells with little or no AS160. Series of mutational analyses revealed that these synergizing actions rely on the phosphotyrosine-binding 1 (PTB1) and calmodulin-binding domains of Tbc1d1 as well as key phosphorylation sites of both AS160 (Thr642) and Tbc1d1 (Ser237 and Thr596). Thus, the emerging cooperative governance relying on the multiple regulatory nodes of both Tbc1d1 and AS160, functioning together, plays a key role in properly deciphering biochemical signals into a physical GLUT4 release process in response to insulin, exercise, and the two in combination."
https://openalex.org/W2950486100,"Considering the impaired function of regenerative cells in myocardial infarction (MI) patients with comorbidities and associated risk factors, cell therapy to enhance the regenerative microenvironment was designed using regeneration-associated cells (RACs), including endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and anti-inflammatory cells.RACs were prepared by quality and quantity control culture of blood mononuclear cells (QQMNCs). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were isolated from Lewis rats and conditioned for 5 days using a medium containing stem cell factors, thrombopoietin, Flt-3 ligand, vascular endothelial growth factor, and interleukin-6 to generate QQMNCs.A 5.3-fold increase in the definitive colony-forming EPCs and vasculogenic EPCs was observed, in comparison to naïve PBMNCs. QQMNCs were enriched with EPCs (28.9-fold, P<0.0019) and M2 macrophages (160.3-fold, P<0.0002). Genes involved in angiogenesis (angpt1, angpt2, and vegfb), stem/progenitors (c-kit and sca-1), and anti-inflammation (arg-1, erg-2, tgfb, and foxp3) were upregulated in QQMNCs. For in vivo experiments, cells were administered into syngeneic rat models of MI. QQMNC-transplanted group (QQ-Tx) preserved cardiac function and fraction shortening 28 days post-MI in comparison with PBMNCs-transplanted (PB-Tx) (P<0.0001) and Control (P<0.0008) groups. QQ-Tx showed enhanced angiogenesis and reduced interstitial left ventricular fibrosis, along with a decrease in neutrophils and an increase in M2 macrophages in the acute phase of MI. Cell tracing studies revealed that intravenously administered QQMNCs preferentially homed to ischemic tissues via blood circulation. QQ-Tx showed markedly upregulated early cardiac transcriptional cofactors (Nkx2-5, 29.8-fold, and Gata-4, 5.2-fold) as well as c-kit (4.5-fold) while these markers were downregulated in PB-Tx. In QQ-Tx animals, de novo blood vessels formed a ""Biological Bypass"", observed macroscopically and microscopically, while PB-Tx and Control-Tx groups showed severe fibrotic adhesion to the surrounding tissues, but no epicardial blood vessels.QQMNCs conferred potent angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties to the regenerative microenvironment, enhancing myocardiogenesis and functional recovery of rat MI hearts."
https://openalex.org/W2903032447,"Multiple fossil discoveries and taphonomic experiments have established the durability of keratin. The utility and specificity of antibodies to identify keratin peptides has also been established, both in extant feathers under varying treatment conditions, and in feathers from extinct organisms. Here, we show localization of feather-keratin antibodies to control and heat-treated feathers, testifying to the repeatability of initial data supporting the preservation potential of keratin. We then show new data at higher resolution that demonstrates the specific response of these antibodies to the feather matrix, we support the presence of protein in heat-treated feathers using ToF-SIMS, and we apply these methods to a fossil feather preserved in the unusual environment of sinter hot springs. We stress the importance of employing realistic conditions such as sediment burial when designing experiments intended as proxies for taphonomic processes occurring in the fossil record. Our data support the hypothesis that keratin, particularly the β-keratin that comprises feathers, has potential to preserve in fossil remains."
https://openalex.org/W2902398255,"The role of aquatic resources in ancient economies and paleodiet is important for understanding the evolution of prehistorical societies. Charred food remains from ancient pottery are valuable molecular evidence of dietary habits in antiquity. However, conventional archaeometric approaches applied in their analysis lack organismal specificity, are affected by abundant environmental contaminants, do not elucidate food processing recipes and are limited in the inland regions where diverse dietary resources are available. We performed proteomics analysis of charred organic deposits adhered on early ceramics from Mesolithic-Neolithic inland site Friesack 4 (Brandenburg, Germany). One of pots-a small coarse bowl radiocarbon dated to the end of the 5th millennium BC-was attributed to Endmesolithic pottery. Proteomics of foodcrust from this vessel identified fine carp roe meal and revealed details of a prehistorical culinary recipe. Ancient proteins were unequivocally distinguished from contemporary contaminants by computing deamidation ratios of glutamine residues. These data paint a broader picture of the site-specific exploitation of aquatic resources and contribute to better understanding of the dietary context of Neolithic transition in European inland."
https://openalex.org/W2902213836,"Government compensation of kidney donors would likely increase the supply of kidneys and prevent the premature deaths of tens of thousands of patients with kidney failure each year. The major argument against it is that it would exploit the poor who would be more likely to accept the offers of compensation. This overlooks the fact that many poor patients desperately need a kidney transplant and would greatly benefit from an increased supply of kidneys. The objective of this study is to empirically test the hypothesis that government compensation of kidney donors would exploit the poor. Exploitation is defined by economists and several noted ethicists as paying donors less than the fair market value of their kidney. Exploitation is expressed in monetary terms and compared with the economic benefit recipients receive from a transplant. Data are from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the United States Renal Data System annual data reports. Educational attainment is used as a proxy for income. We estimate that if the government rewards living donors with a package of non-cash benefits worth $75,000 per kidney, donors would not be exploited. Much more important, this compensation would likely end the kidney shortage, enabling many more patients with kidney failure to obtain transplants and live longer and healthier lives. The value of kidney transplantation to a U.S. recipient is about $1,330,000, which is an order of magnitude greater than any purported exploitation of a living donor (zero to $75,000). Consequently, the aggregate net benefit to the poor alone from kidney transplantation would increase to about $12 billion per year from $1 billion per year currently. Most of the benefit would accrue to poor kidney recipients. But poor donors would receive the fair market value of their kidney, and hence would not be exploited. If the government wanted to ensure that donors also received a net benefit, it could easily do so by increasing the compensation above $75,000 per donor."
https://openalex.org/W2903305000,"Climate change and weather variability pose serious threats to food and nutrition security as well as ecosystems, especially when livelihoods depend heavily on natural resources. This study examines the effect of weather variability (shock) occurring up to three planting and growing season prior on per capita monthly household expenditure in rural Tanzania, Uganda, and Ghana. The analyses combine monthly temperature (1950-2013) and precipitation (1981-2013) data with data from several rounds of household surveys conducted between 1998 and 2013. Substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity is documented in the incidence of shocks, with effects dependent on both the study and lag period considered. Analysis of short panel data shows the cumulative effect of above-average precipitation on expenditure to be negative in Uganda -while positive in Tanzania-, but the relationship does not persist when pooling survey data spanning over a decade. The evidence from pooled data suggests a positive association between above-average temperature (heat wave) and expenditure in (historically cooler) Uganda, with the opposite effect observed in (the relatively warmer) Tanzania. For Ghana, the association between heat wave and expenditure is positive. There is no evidence of heterogeneous effects along several dimensions, except by agro-ecological condition. Further research into the effects of shocks on more direct outcomes-such as agricultural practices, yields, and dietary intake-is therefore recommended to shed light on possible impact pathways and appropriate localized adaptation strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2903470223,"The role of zinc (Zn2+), a modulator of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, in regulating long-term synaptic plasticity at hippocampal CA1 synapses is poorly understood. The effects of exogenous application of Zn2+ and of chelation of endogenous Zn2+ were examined on long-term potentiation (LTP) of stimulus-evoked synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral (SCH) synapses in field CA1 of mouse hippocampal slices using whole-cell patch clamp and field recordings. Low micromolar concentrations of exogenous Zn2+ enhanced the induction of LTP, and this effect required activation of NMDA receptors containing NR2B subunits. Zn2+ elicited a selective increase in NMDA/NR2B fEPSPs, and removal of endogenous Zn2+ with high-affinity Zn2+ chelators robustly reduced the magnitude of stimulus-evoked LTP. Taken together, our data show that Zn2+ at physiological concentrations enhances activation of NMDA receptors containing NR2B subunits, and that this effect enhances the magnitude of LTP."
https://openalex.org/W2588069711,"When outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) occur in OIE member countries with until then disease-free status, member countries can use 'compartmentalisation'. A compartment may be defined as a subset of farms under a common management system, complying with certain stringent surveillance, control and biosecurity measures, and based on that may receive a disease-free status. Based on this disease-free status the compartment is exempted from certain transport restrictions coming into force in case of outbreaks occurring in the country. For deciding whether a candidate compartment is granted official compartment status, it is relevant to assess the additional HPAI transmission risks that would arise due to the exemptions granted. These risks consist of both additional local transmission risks as well as the additional risk of a 'jump' of HPAI infection from one poultry area, via the compartment, to another area. Here such risk assessment is carried out using a spatial mathematical model for between-farm transmission in the Netherlands, yielding insight in the roles of compartment composition and contact structure and identify relevant evaluation criteria for granting HPAI compartment status. At the core of this model are transmission probabilities associated with indirect between-farm contacts, e.g. through feed delivery, egg collection and professional visitors. These probabilities were estimated from Dutch epidemic outbreak data in earlier work. The additional risk of a jump of HPAI from one area, via the compartment, to another area is calculated relative to the direct jump risk. The results show that additional transmission risks caused by a compartment to other farms are mainly dependent on the distance of densely populated poultry areas (DPPAs) to the nearest compartment farm. Apart from conditions on these distances, we also recommend specific routing requirements for transport and other movements within the compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2903167896,"Phosphorylation is the most commonly studied protein post-translational modification (PTM) in biological systems due to its importance in controlling cell division, survival, growth, etc. Despite the thorough research in phosphoproteomics of cells and tissues there is little information on circulating phosphoproteins. We compared serum from 10 healthy dogs and 10 dogs affected by B. canis-caused babesiosis with no organ dysfunctions by employing gel-free LC-MS/MS analysis of individual samples and tandem mass tag (TMT) label-based quantitative analyses of pools, both supported by phosphopeptide enrichment. Results showed a moderate number of phosphorylated proteins (50–55), with 89 phosphorylation sites not previously published for dogs although a number of them matched phosphorylation sites found in mammalian orthologs. Three phosphopeptides showed significant variation in babesiosis-affected dog sera compared to controls: Serum amyloid A (SAA) phosphorylated at serine 101 (up-regulation), kininogen 1 phosphorylated at threonine 326, and fibrinogen α phosphorylated at both threonine 20 and serine 22 (down-regulation). 71.9% of the detected phosphorylated sites were phosphoserine, 16.8% phosphothreonine and only 11.2% phosphotyrosine residues. TMT label-based quantitative analysis showed α-2-HS-glycoprotein / Fetuin A to be the most abundant phosphoprotein (50–70% of all phosphoproteins) followed by kininogen-1 (10–20%). The alterations of phosphorylated proteins observed in canine babesiosis caused by Babesia canis suggest new insights into the largely neglected role of extracellular protein phosphorylation in health and disease, encouraging urgent further research on this area. To the best of our knowledge the present study represents the first attempt to characterize canine serum phosphoproteome."
https://openalex.org/W2951850653,"Background While overall rates of meningococcal disease have been declining in the United States for the past several decades, New York City (NYC) has experienced two serogroup C meningococcal disease outbreaks in 2005–2006 and in 2010–2013. The outbreaks were centered within drug use and sexual networks, were difficult to control, and required vaccine campaigns. Methods Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was used to analyze preserved meningococcal isolates collected before and during the two outbreaks. We integrated and analyzed epidemiologic, geographic, and genomic data to better understand transmission networks among patients. Betweenness centrality was used as a metric to understand the most important geographic nodes in the transmission networks. Comparative genomics was used to identify genes associated with the outbreaks. Results Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C (ST11/ET-37) was responsible for both outbreaks with each outbreak having distinct phylogenetic clusters. WGS did identify some misclassifications of isolates that were more distant from the outbreak strains, as well as those that should have been included based on high genomic similarity. Genomes for the second outbreak were more similar than the first and no polymorphism was found to either be unique or specific to either outbreak lineage. Betweenness centrality as applied to transmission networks based on phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the outbreaks were transmitted within focal communities in NYC with few transmission events to other locations. Conclusions Neisseria meningitidis is an ever changing pathogen and comparative genomic analyses can help elucidate how it spreads geographically to facilitate targeted interventions to interrupt transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2902334174,"DNA template damage can potentially block DNA replication. Cells have therefore developed different strategies to repair template lesions. Activation of the bacterial lesion bypass DNA polymerase V (Pol V) requires both the cleavage of the UmuD subunit to UmuD′ and the acquisition of a monomer of activated RecA recombinase, forming Pol V Mut. Both of these events are mediated by the generation of RecA* via the formation of a RecA–ssDNA filament during the SOS response. Formation of RecA* is itself modulated by competition with the ssDNA-binding protein (SSB) for binding to ssDNA. Previous observations have demonstrated that RecA filament formation on SSB-coated DNA can be favored in the presence of the recombination mediator proteins RecF, RecO, and RecR. We show here using purified proteins that in the presence of SSB and RecA, a stable RecA–ssDNA filament is not formed, although sufficient RecA* is generated to support some activation of Pol V. The presence of RecFOR increased RecA* generation and allowed Pol V to synthesize longer DNA products and to elongate from an unpaired primer terminus opposite template damage, also without the generation of a stable RecA–ssDNA filament.

Overall, these DNA damage repair strategies divide into those that are error-free and those that are error-prone.

Biochemically, the recombination mediator proteins RecF, RecO, and RecR are known to facilitate RecA nucleation on SSB–ssDNA (23Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Biochemical interaction of the Escherichia coli RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins with RecA protein and single-stranded DNA binding protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

It is not surprising, then, that recFOR mutants display a delay in the induction of the SOS response (25Hegde S. Sandler S.J. Clark A.J. Madiraju M.V. recO and recR mutations delay induction of the SOS response in Escherichia coli.Mol. Gen.

These observations led Fujii et al. (27Fujii S. Isogawa A. Fuchs R.P. RecFOR proteins are essential for Pol V-mediated translesion synthesis and mutagenesis.EMBO J. 2006; 25 (17139245): 5754-576310.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) to examine the roll of the RecFOR proteins in TLS by Pol V. They found, using a primer extension assay, that TLS by Pol V in the presence of SSB, RecA, and the β sliding clamp required the RecFOR proteins. They suggested that the RecFOR requirement was a result of mediating RecA filament formation on the ssDNA. We have found a similar requirement for RecFOR in Pol V TLS and show that this requirement is an effect neither on access of Pol V to the 3′ end of the primer nor on Pol V DNA polymerase activity per se but reflects a demand to maintain RecA* levels sufficient for maximal Pol V Mut activity during lesion bypass. To examine Pol V TLS, we used the primer template (p/t) shown in Fig. 1A. Here the bottom, damage-containing template strand is 139 nt long. A 5′-[32P] 27-nt-long primer is annealed such that its 3′-end is 5 nt upstream of the first thymidine residue in a cyclopyrimidine dimer (CPD) or 7 nt upstream of a tetrahydrofuran abasic site analog (THF). The ss template upstream of the 5′ end of the primer prevents the β processivity clamp from sliding off the primer template once it has been loaded. DNA synthesis by Pol V was reconstituted in the presence of β, the DnaX clamp-loading complex (DnaX cx, τ2γδδ′χψ) (7McHenry C.S. DNA replicases from a bacterial perspective.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80 (21675919): 403-43610.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), SSB, RecA, and RecFOR. The incubations were conducted in two steps. First, SSB, RecA, β, DnaX cx, RecA, and RecFOR were incubated with the p/t for 5 min at 37 °C. Pol V was then added, and the incubation continued for 8 min. Reaction products were recovered by ethanol precipitation after phenol-CHCl3 extraction, resuspended in denaturing loading dye, and electrophoresed through polyacrylamide gels (20%) containing 7 m urea. Product formation was quantified by phosphorimaging and is presented as a fraction of total primer. We define the extent of TLS as the primer extended up to and including the base opposite the lesion and extension as the primer extended past the lesion. Fig. 1B shows the results of omitting each of the protein components individually from the reaction using each of the three templates (undamaged, CPD, and THF). Only Pol V and RecA were absolutely required for DNA synthesis (Fig. 1B, left panel, compare lanes 2 and 5 with lane 1). β and SSB stimulated the reaction slightly (by ∼50%, Fig. 1B, left panel, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 1), and the presence of RecFOR activated slightly (Fig. 1B, left panel, compare lane 9 with lane 1). The absence of RecR was strongly inhibitory, indicating that the presence of RecR modulates the activities of RecF and RecO, as has been observed previously (23Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Biochemical interaction of the Escherichia coli RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins with RecA protein and single-stranded DNA binding protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Thus, RecFOR are not required for Pol V–catalyzed DNA polymerase activity, nor are they required to displace SSB from the ssDNA to facilitate formation of a RecA–ssDNA filament to generate RecA*. The equilibrium between SSB and RecA binding to the template DNA presumably allows sufficient RecA* formation to support Pol V activity. Pol V appeared to be capable of polymerizing a limited number of nucleotides on ssDNA coated with RecA (Fig. 1B, left panel, compare lane 4 with lane 1), although this reaction is likely related to the stability of the RecA filament near the primer terminus. However, the addition of RecFOR had a distinct effect on the distribution of the DNA products in the reaction (Fig. 1B, left panel, compare lane 1 with lane 9). The DNA products were longer in the presence of RecFOR (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Pol V processivity either had increased or had a greater level of RecA* than could be achieved in the presence of RecA and SSB was required for extensive Pol V–catalyzed DNA synthesis. Note that the complete lack of DNA synthesis in the absence of RecA (Fig. 1B, left panel, lane 5) indicates that no other component of the reaction was contaminated to any substantive extent with a DNA polymerase activity. Similarly, the lack of DNA synthesis activity in the absence of Pol V (Fig. 1B, left panel, lane 2) demonstrates that the RecA itself was also not contaminated with a polymerase activity. The results were different when damage-containing p/ts were used (Fig. 1B, center and right panels). Interestingly, β and SSB were not required for TLS but were required for extension from the damage (Fig. 1B, center and right panels, compare lanes 3 and 4). The requirement of β for bypass has been noted previously (2Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O’Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. UmuD′2C is an error-prone DNA polymerase, Escherichia coli pol V.Proc.

Indeed, Maor-Shoshani and Livneh (31Maor-Shoshani A. Livneh Z. Analysis of the stimulation of DNA polymerase V of Escherichia coli by processivity proteins.Biochemistry. 2002; 41 (12450411): 14438-1444610.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) noted that β did not stimulate initiation of DNA synthesis by Pol V but did stimulate bypass. Examination of their data suggests that the stimulation of bypass they observed was similar to what we observe here, i.e. stimulation of extension past the damage. RecFOR stimulated extension past the damage on both the CPD and THF templates, whereas they had little effect on either TLS or overall DNA polymerase activity (Fig. 1B, center and right panels, compare lanes 1 and 9). We reasoned that this apparent requirement for RecFOR in extension from damage and the apparent increase in processivity observed in the presence of RecFOR on the undamaged template might both reflect the action of RecFOR in generating RecA*. If this is the case, one would predict that the RecFOR effect would depend on the presence of SSB in the reaction. RecOR are sufficient to exchange RecA with SSB on SSB-coated ssDNA (23Umezu K. Chi N.W. Kolodner R.D. Biochemical interaction of the Escherichia coli RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins with RecA protein and single-stranded DNA binding protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90 (8483906): 3875-387910.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and RecF is thought to provide nucleation for this exchange at the double-stranded edges of gaps (24Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecFOR proteins load RecA protein onto gapped DNA to accelerate DNA strand exchange: a universal step of recombinational repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11 (12769856): 1337-134710.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of RecOR and RecFOR on Pol V activity in the presence and absence of SSB on the three templates (Fig. 2). Comparison of the extents of elongation on the various templates showed that RecFOR stimulated extension on the CPD and THF templates by roughly 5- and 6-fold, respectively, whereas there was little effect in the absence of SSB (Fig. 2B). RecOR had little effect in either the presence or absence of SSB with the CPD template but did show approximately half the stimulatory effect as RecFOR in the presence of SSB with the THF template (Fig. 2B). The requirement for RecF for the maximum effect is interesting and not obviously explained by current biochemistry. These templates do not model a gap in newly replicated DNA because there is no 5′-ended DNA downstream of the template damage where one might expect RecF to facilitate 5′ → 3′ RecA filament growth toward the primer terminus. On the other hand, RecF, with RecR, has been shown to limit extension of the RecA filament from ssDNA onto dsDNA (32Webb B.L. Cox M.M. Inman R.B. Recombinational DNA repair: the RecF and RecR proteins limit the extension of RecA filaments beyond single-strand DNA gaps.Cell. 1997; 91 (9363943): 347-35610.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Extension of the RecA filament at the primer terminus onto the dsDNA formed by the primer and the template would presumably inhibit DNA synthesis by Pol V; thus, preventing such extension could result in the stimulation we observe. It is difficult to judge the dynamic between SSB and RecA with the Pol V system because of the absolute requirement for RecA to observe polymerase activity. We therefore turned to another Y family TLS polymerase from E. coli, DNA polymerase IV, and used it to replace Pol V in the primer extension assay on an undamaged template (Fig. 3). SSB stimulated extension by DNA Pol IV (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and 2), whereas RecA alone inhibited extension (Fig. 3, compare lanes 4 and 2), although it did not shut it down completely, suggesting that the region at the 3′ end of the RecA–ssDNA filament is dynamic, allowing some access by the polymerase. SSB alone was sufficient to overcome the RecA inhibition (Fig. 3, compare lanes 3 and 4), arguing that under our conditions, even though RecA is in 20-fold molar excess of SSB tetramers, the preferred agent binding to the ssDNA is SSB and furthermore suggesting that mixed SSB-RecA–ssDNA filaments are fairly unstable. RecFOR alone had no significant effect (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2 and 7), suggesting that RecF was not competing with Pol IV for the primer terminus (it does bind both ends of a gap (24Morimatsu K. Kowalczykowski S.C. RecFOR proteins load RecA protein onto gapped DNA to accelerate DNA strand exchange: a universal step of recombinational repair.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11 (12769856): 1337-134710.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar)) and that RecO, which is presumably bound to the ssDNA template, does not inhibit polymerization. Even in the presence of all five proteins, SSB, RecA, and RecFOR, Pol IV extended most of the primer to full length (Fig. 3, lane 6). Thus, the presence of RecFOR does not result in the generation of a stable RecA–ssDNA filament under these conditions, where we would expect to observe inhibition (as in Fig. 3, lane 4). If RecFOR are displacing SSB from the DNA to load RecA, SSB binding to ssDNA, RecA–ssDNA filament formation and dissociation, and SSB competition with RecA for binding to ssDNA are thus likely to be quite dynamic. Another assay for examining whether a stable RecA–ssDNA filament was forming was developed by Arad et al. (33Arad G. Hendel A. Urbanke C. Curth U. Livneh Z. Single-stranded DNA-binding protein recruits DNA polymerase V to primer termini on RecA-coated DNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 (18223256): 8274-828210.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These authors showed that accessibility of the 3′ end of the primer, as measured by the ability of exonuclease III (Exo III) to degrade it, was inhibited by RecA but favored by SSB. Using this assay (Fig. 4), RecA inhibited Exo III digestion of the primer (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 2), as expected. SSB had little effect on its own (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 3), as did the loading of β (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 4), suggesting that Exo III could push the β clamp back toward the 5′ end of the primer as it digested the DNA. Exo III digestion was partially recovered when RecA and SSB were present together (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1, 2, 3, and 7), consistent with our conclusions above that SSB was sufficient to displace (or exclude) RecA from the ssDNA template. In the presence of RecA and SSB, the addition of different combinations of RecF, O, and R did not result in any significant increased inhibition of digestion, compared with the combination of RecA and SSB (Fig. 4, compare lane 7 to lanes 8–14), confirming that under the conditions of our assay, RecFOR was not establishing a stable RecA–ssDNA filament. Our data suggest that in the presence of SSB and RecA, RecFOR are not required to form PolV Mut that is capable of substantial DNA synthesis on undamaged templates, although the length distribution of DNA products increases in the presence of RecFOR. However, stimulation by RecFOR becomes apparent when Pol V faces the difficult task of elongating from the unpaired primer terminus opposite a site of template damage. We propose that the RecFOR requirement for the latter reflects the need for an increased level of RecA* required for Pol V Mut to maintain activity. Such a model would also account for the increase in DNA synthesis patch length on the undamaged templates and is consistent with the requirement for the presence of SSB to observe any RecFOR effect. If the model is correct, we would expect that the RecFOR requirement would be bypassed with a variant RecA that was capable of constitutively generating RecA*. Such a variant is RecA730. RecA730 was derived from RecA441 (34Witkin E.M. McCall J.O. Volkert M.R. Wermundsen I.E. Constitutive expression of SOS functions and modulation of mutagenesis resulting from resolution of genetic instability at or near the recA locus of Escherichia coli.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 185 (6211591): 43-5010.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), a recA mutant initially known as tif-1, which was constitutively induced for prophage induction at elevated temperature (35Castellazzi M. George J. Buttin G. Prophage induction and cell division in E. coli: I. Further characterization of the thermosensitive mutation tif-1 whose expression mimics the effect of UV irradiation.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 119 (4565754): 139-15210.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). RecA730 was shown, unlike WT RecA, to be able to displace SSB from ssDNA at low (1 mm) concentrations of magnesium and at all temperatures tested (36Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemical basis of the constitutive repressor cleavage activity of recA730 protein: a comparison to recA441 and recA803 proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (1400384): 20648-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an ability that was attributed to a more rapid association with ssDNA than the WT. Constitutive induction of the SOS response was therefore attributed to the assembly of sufficient RecA730 patches on ssDNA regions that are typically available in an unstressed cell. The activity of WT RecA and RecA730 was compared on the THF p/t in the presence of RecOR or RecFOR or in their absence (Fig. 5). RecA730 displayed the same effect of increasing the length distribution of the DNA synthesis products as we observed previously with RecFOR and WT RecA (Fig. 5, A, compare lanes 6 and 1 with lane 5, and B). RecA730 stimulated elongation past the damage in the absence of RecFOR to a greater extent than observed with WT RecA in the presence of RecFOR (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 6 and 1). The nearly identical behavior of RecA730 compared with WT RecA plus RecFOR indicates that the observed effects of RecFOR reported above relate to the necessity of maintaining a sufficient pool of RecA* that will add the necessary activated RecA monomer to Pol V to form Pol V Mut. Whereas our Pol V assays require the transfer of an activated monomer of RecA* from the RecA–ssDNA filament to PolV, to support our argument that stable RecA–ssDNA filaments were not forming, we used another assay that more directly assesses formation of RecA–ssDNA filaments. Cleavage of the SOS repressor LexA requires binding directly to the deep helical groove of the RecA–ssDNA filament (37Little J.W. Edmiston S.H. Pacelli L.Z. Mount D.W. Cleavage of the Escherichia coli lexA protein by the recA protease.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To measure LexA cleavage, we purified a modified version of LexA that was developed by John Little (39Giese K.C. Michalowski C.B. Little J.W. RecA-dependent cleavage of LexA dimers.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377 (18234215): 148-16110.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in which a portion of the LexA N terminus was deleted and replaced with His and protein kinase A tags (ΔN-His-PKA-LexA (NHP-LexA)). NHP-LexA was shown to be cleaved in the presence of RecA–ssDNA filaments at the same rate as full-length, WT LexA (39Giese K.C. Michalowski C.B. Little J.W. RecA-dependent cleavage of LexA dimers.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 377 (18234215): 148-16110.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We examined [32P]NHP-LexA cleavage under conditions identical to those of the Pol V primer extension assay using either RecA or RecA730. RecA730-mediated NHP-LexA cleavage in the absence of SSB was ∼50% greater than that in the presence of RecA (Fig. 6, compare lanes 3 and 7), similar to what has been reported previously (36Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemical basis of the constitutive repressor cleavage activity of recA730 protein: a comparison to recA441 and recA803 proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (1400384): 20648-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, as expected, based on our data presented above, RecA-mediated cleavage of NHP-LexA was almost completely inhibited in the presence of SSB (Fig. 6, compare lanes 3 and 4), supporting our conclusion that in the presence of SSB and RecA, a stable RecA–ssDNA filament is not formed. Surprisingly, SSB also inhibited RecA730-mediated LexA cleavage significantly, although there was, unlike with RecA, detectable residual cleavage (Fig. 6, compare lanes 7 and 8). The presence of either RecOR or RecFOR led to a partial recovery of LexA cleavage in the presence of SSB with both RecA and RecA730 (Fig. 6, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lane 4 and lanes 9 and 10 with lane 8). Because, unlike with RecA, RecFOR had little effect on RecA730-supported Pol V activity in the presence of SSB (Fig. 5), we suggest that the difference in LexA cleavage mediated by RecA730 compared with RecA in the presence of SSB reports on the extent of RecA* generation required for maintenance of maximal Pol V activity. Thus, using two different assays, one that measures the generation of activated monomers of RecA and one that measures the generation of RecA–ssDNA filaments more directly, we show that stable RecA filaments do not form in the presence of SSB and either RecA or RecA 730 under the conditions described. We note our surprising result that RecA730-ssDNA filament formation was inhibited by SSB similar to RecA–ssDNA filament formation as being inconsistent with a previous report (40Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Properties of recA441 protein-catalyzed DNA strand exchange can be attributed to an enhanced ability to compete with SSB protein.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265 (2406267): 4004-4010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas we cannot explain the different results for certain, one possible explanation might lie in the fact that in the previous report (36Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemical basis of the constitutive repressor cleavage activity of recA730 protein: a comparison to recA441 and recA803 proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (1400384): 20648-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) M13 phage DNA was used as the DNA effector. Whereas this DNA is often used as a ssDNA, it is, in fact, highly structured (41Reckmann B. Grosse F. Urbanke C. Frank R. Blöcker H. Krauss G. Analysis of secondary structures in M13mp8 (+) single-stranded DNA by the pausing of DNA polymerase α.Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152 (2996896): 633-64310.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with extensive double-stranded regions. Therefore it is possible that Lavery and Kowalczykowski (36Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemical basis of the constitutive repressor cleavage activity of recA730 protein: a comparison to recA441 and recA803 proteins.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267 (1400384): 20648-20658Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were reporting on results where both RecA–ssDNA and RecA-dsDNA filaments were forming. The latter can also mediate LexA cleavage (42Lu C. Echols H. RecA protein and SOS. Correlation of mutagenesis phenotype with binding of mutant RecA proteins to duplex DNA and LexA cleavage.J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196 (2960817): 497-50410.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As judged by the observations that RecA in the absence of SSB strongly inhibits Pol V DNA synthesis activity (Fig. 1) and that this inhibition is obviated when SSB is present, we argue that even in the presence of RecFOR, a stable, exclusively RecA–ssDNA filament does not form. This conclusion is strongly supported by similar results measuring LexA cleavage under the identical conditions (Fig. 6), an assay that more directly assesses RecA–ssDNA filament formation. This view is somewhat counter to the established view that at elevated magnesium concentrations RecA can displace SSB (43Lavery P.E. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemical basis of the temperature-inducible constitutive protease activity of the RecA441 protein of Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203 (2974887): 861-87410.1074/jbc.RA117.001068Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, RecA* is clearly being formed in our primer extension assays because Pol V DNA synthesis is activated. We suggest that the more likely scenario is that formation and dissociation of the RecA–ssDNA filament in the presence of SSB is quite dynamic, presumably mediated by mixed SSB-RecA–ssDNA filaments. This equilibrium results in the generation of sufficient Pol V Mut for simple elongation of a primer terminus. However, more difficult synthesis, for example, extensive synthesis of long DNA products with the undamaged template and extension from a primer terminus opposite a site of template damage, requires either higher concentrations of or continuous production of RecA*. It is therefore in these scenarios that we find a significant stimulation of Pol V Mut activity by the RecA mediator proteins RecFOR. The underlying reason for what we have observed is that Pol V Mut processivity is likely to be very low, and the polymerase may require repeated attempts before it is successful in elongating from an unpaired primer terminus."
https://openalex.org/W2902751793,"The Strait of Gibraltar, the gateway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, has a convulsive geological history, with recurring closing and opening events since the late Miocene. As a consequence, this region has played a major role in the evolutionary history of many species. Cynara baetica (Compositae) is a diploid perennial herb distributed in both sides of this strait. It is currently subdivided into two subspecies: C. baetica subsp. baetica for the Spanish populations, and C. baetica subsp. maroccana for the Moroccan ones. Following three different approximations of species delimitation, including phylogenetic and population genetic analyses (based on three AFLP primer combinations and two intergenic spacers of cpDNA), ecological niche modeling (ENM) and morphological studies, this taxon is investigated and reinterpreted. The results obtained showed a clear genetic, morphological and ecological differentiation between the two taxa and the important role played by the Strait of Gibraltar as a geographical barrier. Based on this evidence, the current taxonomic treatment is modified (both taxa should recover their specific rank) and specific conservation guidelines are proposed for the newly delimited taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2902907237,"Ritualized actions are common in daily life, and prevalent across cultures. Adults have been shown, under experimental conditions, to treat objects subjected to ritualized action as special and different relative to objects subjected to non-ritualized action. Similarly, children as young as 4, are sensitive to ritualized actions-frequently reproducing such actions at high fidelity. The current cross-cultural experiment attempts to extend existing findings among two culturally distinct groups of children with regard to object-directed rituals. We predicted that children's preference for a reward would be influenced by ritualized action (but not non-ritualized action). Over two trials we presented children in Australia (N = 93; mean age = 6.03 years, SD = 2.07 years) and Vanuatu (N = 109; mean age = 6.13 years, SD = 1.96 years) with two identical rewards, which was either subjected to ritualized action or non-ritualized action. Contrary to previous findings among adults, ritualized action did not influence children's preference for a reward. We frame the current results in the context of socially relevant group rituals, and discuss the implications for both wider theory and methods. We conclude with a call for pre-registered replications."
https://openalex.org/W2902432240,"We related Louisiana Waterthrush (Parkesia motacilla) demographic response and nest survival to benthic macroinvertebrate aquatic prey and to shale gas development parameters using models that accounted for both spatial and non-spatial sources of variability in a Central Appalachian USA watershed. In 2013, aquatic prey density and pollution intolerant genera (i.e., pollution tolerance value <4) decreased statistically with increased waterthrush territory length but not in 2014 when territory densities were lower. In general, most demographic responses to aquatic prey were variable and negatively related to aquatic prey in 2013 but positively related in 2014. Competing aquatic prey covariate models to explain nest survival were not statistically significant but differed annually and in general reversed from negative to positive influence on daily survival rate. Potential hydraulic fracturing runoff decreased nest survival both years and was statistically significant in 2014. The EPA Rapid Bioassessment protocol (EPA) and Habitat Suitability Index (HSI) designed for assessing suitability requirements for waterthrush were positively linked to aquatic prey where higher scores increased aquatic prey metrics, but EPA was more strongly linked than HSI and varied annually. While potential hydraulic fracturing runoff in 2013 may have increased Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) richness, in 2014 shale gas territory disturbance decreased EPT richness. In 2014, intolerant genera decreased at the territory and nest level with increased shale gas disturbance suggesting the potential for localized negative effects on waterthrush. Loss of food resources does not seem directly or solely responsible for demographic declines where waterthrush likely were able to meet their foraging needs. However collective evidence suggests there may be a shale gas disturbance threshold at which waterthrush respond negatively to aquatic prey community changes. Density-dependent regulation of their ability to adapt to environmental change through acquisition of additional resources may also alter demographic response."
https://openalex.org/W2903173631,"Basic color terms used in Mandarin Chinese have been controversial since first discussed by Berlin and Kay in 1969. Previous studies showed much inconsistency on what should be considered as basic color terms in Mandarin Chinese. In the present study, we investigated categories of color rather than merely the color terms used by Taiwanese native Mandarin speakers. Using samples conforming to the Berlin and Kay survey, various colors were chosen from a collection of Natural Color System (NCS) colored papers and mounted on a piece of neutral gray card. The card was then mounted on a touch-screen, under D65 illumination. Thirty-two single-character color related Mandarin terms were selected from a Chinese character database according to frequency of use. Participants were required to select the color sample that matched the term by pressing a virtual button on the touch screen. The results show that certain terms can be directly correlated to basic color terms in English, comparable with the results of Berlin and Kay's original study and those that followed. However, some terms, such as Mo ( ink), Tie ( iron), and Cai (vegetable), show a wide spread of term maps and inconsistent use among subjects. Principle component analysis (PCA) procedures were used to analysis the commodity of data among subjects. The findings suggest that the basic color categories among Mandarin Chinese speakers are similar to those found in the World Color Survey (WCS), but are represented by wide-spread and inconsistent color terms among speakers."
https://openalex.org/W2902733970,"Introduction “Lean” is a set of management principles which focus on increasing value and efficiency by reducing or avoiding waste (e.g., overproduction, defects, inventory, transportation, waiting, motion, over processing). It has been applied to manufacturing, education, and health care, leading to optimized process flow, increased efficiency and increased team empowerment. However, to date, it has not been applied to neuroimaging research. Methods Lean principles, such as Value stream mapping (e.g. a tool with which steps in the workflow can be identified on which to focus improvement efforts), 5S (e.g. an organizational method to boost workplace efficiency and efficacy) and Root-cause analysis (e.g. a problem-solving approach to identify key points of failure in a system) were applied to an ongoing, large neuroimaging study that included seven research visits per participant. All team members participated in a half-day exercise in which the entire project flow was visualized and areas of inefficiency were identified. Changes focused on removing obstacles, standardization, optimal arrangement of equipment and root-cause-analysis. A process for continuous improvement was also implemented. Total time of an experiment was recorded before implementation of Lean for two participants and after implementation of Lean for two participants. Satisfaction of team members was assessed anonymously on a 5-item Likert scale, ranging from much worsened to much improved. Results All team members (N = 6) considered the overall experience of conducting an experiment much improved after implementation of Lean. Five out of six team members indicated a much-improved reduction in time, with the final team member considering this somewhat improved. Average experiment time was reduced by 13% after implementation of Lean (from 142 and 147 minutes to 124 and 128 minutes). Discussion Lean principles can be successfully applied to neuroimaging research. Training in Lean principles for junior research scientists is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2952004263,"Iodine deficiency is the single most common cause of preventable mental impairment in communities with suboptimal iodine intake. Objective of the present study was to assess in more detail the iodine status and knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP) relating to use of iodised salt in a remote community in Kotidanga area, Kerema district, Gulf province, Papua New Guinea. This prospective school and community based cross-sectional study was carried out in 2017. Simple random sampling was used to select schools. Multistage sampling was used to randomly select 300 children aged 6 to 12 years, of which 289 consented to participate in the study. A single urine sample was collected from each of the consenting children, as well as a salt sample from their households. Discretionary salt intake was assessed in a sub-sample of the children’s households. Salt iodine content and urinary iodine concentration (UIC) were analysed. A semi-structured modified Food and Agriculture Organisation questionnaire was used to assess KAP of three different community groups. Only 64% of households had salt on the day of data collection. Mean iodine content in household salt samples was 29.0 ± 19.1 ppm. Iodine content was below 30.0 ppm in 54.8% and below 15.0 ppm in 31.2% of salt samples. Mean per capita discretionary intake of household salt was 2.9 ± 1.8 g/day. Median UIC was 25.5 μg/L and Interquartile Range was 15.0 to 47.5 μg/L, indicating moderate status iodine nutrition. Median UIC was 34.3 μg/L for children in households with salt, compared to 15.5 μg/L for children in households without salt, indicating severe iodine deficiency in the latter group. The three community groups had limited knowledge about importance of using iodised salt and consequences of iodine deficiency on health outcomes. This remote community has limited access to adequately iodised household salt due to high cost, inappropriate packaging, storage and food preparation, resulting in iodine deficiency. Strategies to increase iodine intake are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2899154970,"Contractile properties of myofibers are dictated by the abundance of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. MyHC composition designates muscle function, and its alterations could unravel differential muscle involvement in muscular dystrophies and aging. Current analyses are limited to visual assessments in which myofibers expressing multiple MyHC isoforms are prone to misclassification. As a result, complex patterns and subtle alterations are unidentified. We developed a high-throughput, data-driven myofiber analysis to quantitatively describe the variations in myofibers across the muscle. We investigated alterations in myofiber composition between genotypes, 2 muscles, and 2 age groups. We show that this analysis facilitates the discovery of complex myofiber compositions and its dependency on age, muscle type, and genetic conditions.—Raz, V., Raz, Y., van de Vijver, D., Bindellini, D., van Putten, M., van den Akker, E.

https://openalex.org/W2902425368,"Underground gas storage in rock salt is of great importance for peak-shaving and emergency gas supply. This paper addressed an actual rock salt underground gas storage facility in Jiangsu province, China, as the research project and carried out the following research centered on a detailed geological model, a salt cavern model and the process of gas injection and brine discharge. First, based on the theory of gas-liquid two-phase flow, the authors established a relationship between brine flow and natural gas bubbles under high pressure in the process of brine discharge. Second, the effect of pipe depth on the gas injection and brine discharge was simulated. The objective was mainly to choose the best combination of pipe depth and rate of brine discharge flow based on analysis of the relationship between the brine discharge pipe depth and the flow rate of the residual brine, and the optimal rate was given according to different distances. Third, the effect of residual brine on the gas injection and brine discharge was analyzed. The relationship curves between the maximum velocity on the surface of brine and the distance from the lower end of the brine discharge pipe to the bottom of the gas storage were obtained, and reasonable rates were suggested under different actual working conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2903429680,"Ecological communities change across spatial and environmental gradients due to (i) changes in species composition, (ii) changes in the frequency or strength of interactions or (iii) changes in the presence of the interactions. Here we use the communities of aquatic invertebrates inhabiting clusters of bromeliad phytotelms along the Brazilian coast as a model system for examining variation in multi-trophic communities. We first document the variation in the species pools of sites across a geographical climate gradient. Using the same sites, we also explored the geographic variation in species interaction strength using a Markov network approach. We found that community composition differed along a gradient of water volume within bromeliads due to the spatial turnover of some species. From the Markov network analysis, we found that the interactions of certain predators differed due to differences in bromeliad water volume. Overall, this study illustrates how a multi-trophic community can change across an environmental gradient through changes in both species and their interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2903479812,"Concern is growing that business enterprises focus primarily on their economic activities while disregarding the adverse environmental and social effects of these activities. To contribute to the literature on this matter, this study investigates a novel bi-objective inventory allocation planning problem with supplier selection and carbon trading across multiple periods under uncertainty. The concepts of a carbon credit price and a carbon cap are proposed to demonstrate the effect of carbon emissions costs on inventory allocation network costs. Demands of manufacturers, transport price, and defect rate of materials that should be rejected are set as random variables. We combine normalized normal constraint method, differential evolution algorithm, and uncertainty simulation to deal with the complex model. One representative case shows the effectiveness and practicability of this model and proposed method. The Pareto frontier is generated by solving the bi-objective model. We extend the results of numerical examples in large scale problems, and compare the solution method results with exact solutions. The environmental objective across the inventory allocation network varies with changes of the carbon cap and the carbon credit price."
https://openalex.org/W2902835978,"In melanoma, like in other cancers, both genetic alterations and epigenetic underlie the metastatic process. These effects are usually measured by changes in both methylome and transcriptome profiles, whose cross-correlation remains uncertain. We aimed to assess at systems scale the significance of epigenetic treatment in melanoma cells with different metastatic potential.Treatment by DAC demethylation with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine of two melanoma cell lines endowed with different metastatic potential, SKMEL-2 and HS294T, was performed and high-throughput coupled RNA-Seq and RRBS-Seq experiments delivered differential profiles (DiP) of both transcriptomes and methylomes. Methylation levels measured at both TSS and gene body were studied to inspect correlated patterns with wide-spectrum transcript abundance levels quantified in both protein coding and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) regions. The DiP were then mapped onto standard bio-annotation sources (pathways, biological processes) and network configurations were obtained. The prioritized associations for target identification purposes were expected to elucidate the reprogramming dynamics induced by the epigenetic therapy. The interactomic connectivity maps of each cell line were formed to support the analysis of epigenetically re-activated genes. i.e. those supposedly silenced by melanoma. In particular, modular protein interaction networks (PIN) were used, evidencing a limited number of shared annotations, with an example being MAPK13 (cascade of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli). This gene is also a target associated to the PANDAR ncRNA, therapeutically relevant because of its aberrant expression observed in various cancers. Overall, the non-metastatic SKMEL-2 map reveals post-treatment re-activation of a richer pathway landscape, involving cadherins and integrins as signatures of cell adhesion and proliferation. Relatively more lncRNAs were also annotated, indicating more complex regulation patterns in view of target identification. Finally, the antigen maps matched to DiP display other differential signatures with respect to the metastatic potential of the cell lines. In particular, as demethylated melanomas show connected targets that grow with the increased metastatic potential, also the potential target actionability seems to depend to some degree on the metastatic state. However, caution is required when assessing the direct influence of re-activated genes over the identified targets. In light of the stronger treatment effects observed in non-metastatic conditions, some limitations likely refer to in silico data integration tools and resources available for the analysis of tumor antigens.Demethylation treatment strongly affects early melanoma progression by re-activating many genes. This evidence suggests that the efficacy of this type of therapeutic intervention is potentially high at the pre-metastatic stages. The biomarkers that can be assessed through antigens seem informative depending on the metastatic conditions, and networks help to elucidate the assessment of possible targets actionability."
