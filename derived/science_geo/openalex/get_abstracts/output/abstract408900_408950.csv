However, the mechanisms underlying DBS effects remain enigmatic and are the subject of an ongoing debate. Here, we present and test a closed-loop stimulation strategy for PD in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) primate model of PD. Application of pallidal closed-loop stimulation leads to dissociation between changes in basal ganglia (BG) discharge rates and patterns, providing insights into PD pathophysiology. Furthermore, cortico-pallidal closed-loop stimulation has a significantly greater effect on akinesia and on cortical and pallidal discharge patterns than standard open-loop DBS and matched control stimulation paradigms. Thus, closed-loop DBS paradigms, by modulating pathological oscillatory activity rather than the discharge rate of the BG-cortical networks, may afford more effective management of advanced PD. Such strategies have the potential to be effective in additional brain disorders in which a pathological neuronal discharge pattern can be recognized."
https://openalex.org/W1976193721,"We present a high-dimensional model of the representational space in human ventral temporal (VT) cortex in which dimensions are response-tuning functions that are common across individuals and patterns of response are modeled as weighted sums of basis patterns associated with these response tunings. We map response-pattern vectors, measured with fMRI, from individual subjects' voxel spaces into this common model space using a new method, ""hyperalignment."" Hyperalignment parameters based on responses during one experiment--movie viewing--identified 35 common response-tuning functions that captured fine-grained distinctions among a wide range of stimuli in the movie and in two category perception experiments. Between-subject classification (BSC, multivariate pattern classification based on other subjects' data) of response-pattern vectors in common model space greatly exceeded BSC of anatomically aligned responses and matched within-subject classification. Results indicate that population codes for complex visual stimuli in VT cortex are based on response-tuning functions that are common across individuals."

Contextual fear memories in rodents rely on the hippocampus immediately following training but are unaffected by hippocampal lesions or pharmacological inhibition weeks later. With fast optogenetic methods, we examine the real-time contribution of hippocampal CA1 excitatory neurons to remote memory and find that contextual fear memory recall, even weeks after training, can be reversibly abolished by temporally precise optogenetic inhibition of CA1. When this inhibition is extended to match the typical time course of pharmacological inhibition, remote hippocampus dependence converts to hippocampus independence, suggesting that long-term memory retrieval normally depends on the hippocampus but can adaptively shift to alternate structures. Further revealing the plasticity of mechanisms required for memory recall, we confirm the remote-timescale importance of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and implicate CA1 in ACC recruitment for remote recall.

The hippocampus is an activator of recent and remote long-term memories CA1 neurons orchestrate an activity pattern associated with remote recall Default brain structures used for remote recall can adaptively shift within minutes Accute inhibition of ACC inhibits remote but not recent contextual memory The consolidation of remote memories relies on both synaptic processes on the timescale of minutes to hours, and circuit consolidation over weeks to years (Frankland and Bontempi, 2005Frankland P.W.

Pioneering work on the circuitry of memory has shown that the process of long-term contextual fear memory consolidation requires early involvement of the hippocampus, followed by the neocortex.

Such graded retrograde amnesia is also observed in human patients with medial temporal lobe injuries (Squire and Alvarez, 1995Squire L.R. Alvarez P.

Indeed, studies causing extensive hippocampal damage have reported nongraded retrograde amnesia for fear conditioning (FC) (Sutherland et al., 2008Sutherland R.J. O'Brien J. Lehmann H.

This and other work has led to the “multiple trace theory” that the hippocampal memory trace is not replaced by the cortical one, but rather both memories are in continuous interplay, and the effect of hippocampal lesions may depend on both the nature of the task and the nature of the lesion (Cipolotti and Bird, 2006Cipolotti L.

This pioneering work on the circuitry of memory has involved physical, pharmacological, and genetic lesion studies, which have greatly enhanced our understanding of neural systems. These methods are highly effective but typically involve tradeoffs between cellular and temporal precision. Elegant genetic interventions can be cell type specific (McHugh et al., 2007McHugh T.J.

To begin optogenetic exploration of the cellular and circuit underpinnings of long-term memory, we expressed the fast optogenetic inhibitor eNpHR3.1 (Gradinaru et al., 2010Gradinaru V. Zhang F. Ramakrishnan C. Mattis J. Prakash R. Diester I. Goshen I. Thompson K.R. Deisseroth K.

As it is known that contextual FC but not auditory-cued FC relies on the hippocampus, whereas the amygdala is required for both contextual and auditory-cued FC (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5778) Google Scholar, Maren, 2001Maren S. Neurobiology of Pavlovian fear conditioning.Annu. Rev.

Neurosci. 2004; 5: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar), we employed fiberoptic-mediated light delivery (Adamantidis et al., 2007Adamantidis A.R. Zhang F. Aravanis A.M.

Neural Eng. 2007; 4: S143-S156Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) to these and other neural circuits of freely moving animals in the setting of contextual FC and recall, capitalizing on the circuit specificity of this behavior and well-defined temporal separation between different stages of memory (acquisition, consolidation, and recall). We employed a lentiviral vector encoding eNpHR3.1 fused in-frame to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eNpHR3.1-EYFP) under control of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) promoter, selective for excitatory glutamatergic neurons. eNpHR3.1 is a truncated version of eNpHR3.0 that has a deletion of the intrinsic N-terminal signal peptide and that is similar to eNpHR3.0 in both the photocurrent and the hyperpolarization induced in neurons (Figures S1A and S1B available online). Stereotactic delivery of the CaMKIIα::eNpHR3.1 vector was found to result in CA1-specific expression (Figures 1A, 1B , and S1C). Within the transfected area, 94% of the CaMKIIα cells expressed eNpHR3.1, and the promoter provided essentially complete specificity as well (Figure 1C). To verify the physiological effect of eNpHR3.1 on CA1 neuronal activity, we performed optrode recordings in anesthetized mice (Figure 1D) and confirmed that continuous 561 nm illumination of excitatory CA1 neurons inhibited spiking in vivo in a temporally precise, stable, and reversible manner (Figure 1E).Figure 1Specific Optogenetic Inhibition of Excitatory Neurons in Dorsal CA1 Reduces Neuronal ActivityShow full caption(A) Double lentiviral injection resulted in eNpHR3.1 expression in CA1 only.(B) eNpHR3.1 is expressed in the neuronal membrane around the soma, as well as in the apical and basal dendrites of CA1 neurons.(C) CaMKIIα::eNpHR3.1 was expressed in 94% (458/486 cells, from three mice) of CA1 pyramidal neurons, with 100% specificity (all eNpHR3.1-EYFP cells were CaMKIIα positive).(D) In vivo CA1 “optrode” recording setup.(E) Illumination of CA1 neurons in eNpHR3.1-expressing mice resulted in a reversible reduction in spiking frequency (2.41 ± 1.1 Hz, 0.54 ± 0.4 Hz, and 4.23 ± 1.4 Hz; before, during, and after light administration, respectively, in five traces from two mice; p < 0.001), without affecting average spike amplitude (79.3 ± 11.11 μV, 68.80 ± 14.4 μV, and 66.82 ± 5.8 μV; before, during, and after light).

A representative optrode recording trace as well as average frequency and amplitude are shown (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]). For additional information about eNpHR 3.1 in the hippocampus, see Figure S1. Understanding of the involvement of the hippocampus in contextual FC is based on physical, pharmacological, and genetic lesions to this structure in which the interval between lesion and testing ranges from tens of minutes to several weeks. To test whether real-time optogenetic inhibition of CA1 could modulate memory formation, we delivered bilateral continuous green (561 nm) light to dorsal CA1 (Figure 2A ) during FC training in all animals, thereby delivering CA1 inhibition in eNpHR3.1 but not control mice. Fear memory was assessed the next day in the absence of light, and the dorsal CA1 optogenetic inhibition during training was found to prevent contextual fear memory (Figure 2B, left). To test whether this effect was reversible, all mice were retrained in the same context without light and tested again on the next day; eNpHR3.1 mice exhibited intact contextual memory when no light was administered during training (Figure 2B, middle). We next retested the same mice with light delivery during recall to examine whether dorsal CA1 optogenetic inhibition could also interfere with recall, and we found that the memory that had been present only the day before became unavailable for recall under illumination (Figure 2B, right). These experiments suggest a real-time involvement of CA1 excitatory cells in acquisition and recall of recent contextual fear memory. Importantly, eNpHR3.1 mice demonstrated intact auditory-cued fear memory acquisition following CA1 light inhibition during training (Figure 2C, left) and intact cued fear recall with illumination during the test (Figure 2C, right), demonstrating the functional specificity of the optogenetic manipulation in affecting only the hippocampus-dependent task. Because exploration is critical for contextual fear acquisition (Fanselow, 1990Fanselow M.S. Factors governing one-trial contextual conditioning.Learn. Behav. 1990; 18: 264-270Crossref Scopus (420) Google Scholar, McHugh and Tonegawa, 2007McHugh T.J. Tonegawa S. Spatial exploration is required for the formation of contextual fear memory.Behav. Neurosci. 2007; 121: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we measured exploration in the conditioning chamber during training with light and found no difference between eNpHR3.1 and control mice (Figure 2D). To verify that CA1 optogenetic inhibition had no anxiolytic effect, mice were tested for open-field exploration during light administration. No differences in path length (Figure 2E), velocity (Figure 2F), or the percent of time spent in the center of the field (a sign of anxiety-related behavior) were found between eNpHR3.1 and control mice (Figure 2G). Finally, we bilaterally injected mice in the basolateral amygdala (BLA; Figure 2H) and found that we could optogenetically inhibit both contextual and auditory-cued FC acquisition (Figure 2I), as expected from prior findings that acquisition and expression of fear depend on the amygdala (LeDoux, 2000LeDoux J.E. Emotion circuits in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (5778) Google Scholar, Maren and Quirk, 2004Maren S. Quirk G.J. Neuronal signalling of fear memory.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Together this constellation of findings supports the validity of the optogenetic system and a wide array of major prior findings in the memory literature by directly demonstrating the real-time role of the hippocampus in acquisition and recall. We next explored the role of the hippocampus in remote recall. We trained a group of mice and tested recall 4 weeks later (Figure 3A ), far into the remote phase when no hippocampus involvement is expected. Surprisingly, we found that CA1 inhibition during recall blocked remote fear memory. This interference was reversible; when the same mice were retested on the next day without illumination, fear memory was fully expressed (Figure 3A). Moreover, eNpHR3.1 mice demonstrated intact remote auditory-cued fear recall with illumination during the cued test (Figure 3B), demonstrating that fear expression mechanisms remained intact. To test whether the hippocampus would be involved in contextual fear recall as long as a memory trace could be practically detected in our hands, we trained two additional populations of mice and tested recall 9 or 12 weeks later. We found that CA1 inhibition during recall blocked remote fear memory even after these very long intervals (Figures 3C and 3D). These results point to ongoing involvement of the hippocampus in remote contextual fear memories, suggesting that the intact hippocampus can still act as the default activator of the memory trace. However, we were able to obtain pharmacological data consistent with prior physical, pharmacological, or genetic lesions to the hippocampus, in which the interval between lesion and recall test ranges from tens of minutes to several weeks (Anagnostaras et al., 1999Anagnostaras S.G.

Indeed, in our own hands as well, pharmacological inhibition of the hippocampus using TTX and CNQX, as previously reported (Kitamura et al., 2009Kitamura T. Saitoh Y. Takashima N. Murayama A. Niibori Y. Ageta H. Sekiguchi M. Sugiyama H. Inokuchi K. Adult neurogenesis modulates the hippocampus-dependent period of associative fear memory.Cell. 2009; 139: 814-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), disturbed only recent (Figure 3E) but not remote (Figure 3F) fear recall, with one possible interpretation being that the speed of optogenetic inhibition here permits necessity testing without allowing expression of compensatory mechanisms. To test this hypothesis that temporal precision is a critical factor accounting for the discrepancy between optogenetic and pharmacological findings, we repeated the remote optogenetic experiment either with illumination limited to the duration of the test as before (Figure 4A , “precise”) or with prolonged illumination for 30 min before testing and during the test to mimic a slower intervention and allow time for putative compensatory mechanisms to be engaged (Figure 4A, “prolonged”). Precise optogenetic inhibition impaired remote memory, whereas prolonged inhibition had no detectable effect (Figure 4A). Furthermore, when mice from the prolonged group were retested on the next day with precise light administration, inhibited recall was observed (Figure 4A, right). To validate these results, we trained mice and tested 1 day later with prolonged illumination, which confirmed that prolonged optogenetic CA1 inhibition, which had no effect on remote memory, still could block recent memory. We found that prolonged optogenetic inhibition was a fully potent intervention, significantly inhibiting recent fear memory recall (Figure 4B) just as with the pharmacological effect (Figure 3D). Additionally, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings (in slices prepared from the prolonged group in Figure 4A), which revealed that the ability of eNpHR3.1 to suppress spiking was stable throughout 30 min recording periods, as expected (Gradinaru et al., 2010Gradinaru V. Zhang F. Ramakrishnan C. Mattis J. Prakash R. Diester I. Goshen I. Thompson K.R. Deisseroth K. Molecular and cellular approaches for diversifying and extending optogenetics.Cell. 2010; 141: 154-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), and was fully reversible (Figure 4C). Although it cannot be ruled out that in vivo inhibition may be less efficient than in this slice preparation, in vivo prolonged inhibition efficacy in the awake, freely moving state is supported by both inhibition of recent recall (Figure 4B) and c-fos measures of activity, as described in Figure 6 below. We next sought to determine whether the remote fear memory expression could be interrupted even in the midst of a behavioral session. We trained another population of mice and characterized the cohorts with memory testing 5 weeks after contextual FC, first verifying persistence of the memory trace (without light during testing, observing similar performance in both eNpHR3.1 and control groups as expected; Figure 4D, left). On the next day, the same mice were tested under illumination, and the eNpHR3.1 group failed to recall the memory (Figure 4D, left). This effect in turn was fully reversible, as on the next day, when tested without light delivery, eNpHR3.1 mice demonstrated intact contextual memory (Figure 4D, right); however, as soon as the light was delivered again within this session, after the mice had already recalled the aversive context and expressed fear, the fear response immediately ceased (Figure 4D, right; Movie S1. No Effect of Light Delivery during Contextual Fear Recall in a Control Mouse, Related to Figure 4, Movie S2. Light Delivery to eNpHR3.1-Expressing Mouse during Contextual Fear Recall Terminates the Fear Response, Related to Figure 4) in eNpHR3.1 but not control animals. Together these data may unify certain disparate findings, by supporting prior work in suggesting that the remote memory trace is not stored only by these targeted hippocampal neurons (as when given enough time to compensate for hippocampal inactivation, the memory trace can still be retrieved, presumably by other structures in line with previous reports) but at the same time revealing the surprising finding that the intact hippocampus may be a default activator of the remote memory trace and actively participates in its maintenance throughout the recall session. Previous studies of the expression of immediate-early gene products (e.g., zif268 and c-Fos) have indicated that the transition from recent to remote memory can be accompanied by a decrease in recruited hippocampal activity and an increase in recruited neocortical activity in ACC and prefrontal cortex (Frankland et al., 2004Frankland P.W.

To extend this activity mapping approach to the setting of CA1 optogenetic control, we inhibited CA1 during training or remote recall and assessed induction of c-Fos across the entire brain (Figure 5, Figure 6). With illumination during training, eNpHR3.1 mice demonstrated markedly reduced c-Fos expression specifically in CA1 compared with trained control animals (Figures 5A–5D) but showed BLA activity equivalent to that of trained controls (Figure 5D), revealing the expected hippocampus-independent engagement of fear circuitry during training.

Drosophila is currently the eukaryotic model organism that permits the most sophisticated in vivo manipulations to address the function of neurons and neuronally expressed genes. Here, we summarize many of the techniques that help assess the role of specific neurons by labeling, removing, or altering their activity. We also survey genetic manipulations to identify and characterize neural genes by mutation, overexpression, and protein labeling. Here, we attempt to acquaint the reader with available options and contexts to apply these methods."

However, proof for the involvement of CFH, as opposed to a neighboring transcript, and knowledge of the potential mechanism of susceptibility alleles are lacking. Assuming that rare functional variants might provide mechanistic insights, we used genotype data and high-throughput sequencing to discover a rare, high-risk CFH haplotype with a c.3628C>T mutation that resulted in an R1210C substitution. This allele has been implicated previously in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and it abrogates C-terminal ligand binding(7,8). Genotyping R1210C in 2,423 AMD cases and 1,122 controls demonstrated high penetrance (present in 40 cases versus 1 control, P = 7.0 × 10(-6)) and an association with a 6-year-earlier onset of disease (P = 2.3 × 10(-6)). This result suggests that loss-of-function alleles at CFH are likely to drive AMD risk. This finding represents one of the first instances in which a common complex disease variant has led to the discovery of a rare penetrant mutation."

We investigated the functional role of the FOF using rats trained to perform a memory-guided orienting task, in which there was a delay period between the end of a sensory stimulus instructing orienting direction and the time of the allowed motor response. Unilateral inactivation of the FOF resulted in impaired contralateral responses. Extracellular recordings of single units revealed that 37% of FOF neurons had delay period firing rates that predicted the direction of the rats' later orienting motion. Our data provide the first electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence supporting the existence in the rat, as in the primate, of a frontal cortical area involved in the preparation and/or planning of orienting responses."

Sewage treatment plants (STPs) are considered as important reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and activated sludge characterized with high microbial density and diversity facilitates ARG horizontal gene transfer (HGT) via mobile genetic elements (MGEs). However, little is known regarding the pool of ARGs and MGEs in sludge microbiome. In this study, the transposon aided capture (TRACA) system was employed to isolate novel plasmids from activated sludge of one STP in Hong Kong, China. We also used Illumina Hiseq 2000 high-throughput sequencing and metagenomics analysis to investigate the plasmid metagenome. Two novel plasmids were acquired from the sludge microbiome by using TRACA system and one novel plasmid was identified through metagenomics analysis. Our results revealed high levels of various ARGs as well as MGEs for HGT, including integrons, transposons and plasmids. The application of the TRACA system to isolate novel plasmids from the environmental metagenome, coupled with subsequent high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis, highlighted the prevalence of ARGs and MGEs in microbial community of STPs."
https://openalex.org/W2024199089,"Curcumin has many pharmaceutical applications, many of which arise from its potent antioxidant properties. The present research examined the antioxidant activities of curcumin in polar solvents by a comparative study using ESR, reduction of ferric iron in aqueous medium and intracellular ROS/toxicity assays. ESR data indicated that the steric hindrance among adjacent big size groups within a galvinoxyl molecule limited the curcumin to scavenge galvinoxyl radicals effectively, while curcumin showed a powerful capacity for scavenging intracellular smaller oxidative molecules such as H2O2, HO•, ROO•. Cell viability and ROS assays demonstrated that curcumin was able to penetrate into the polar medium inside the cells and to protect them against the highly toxic and lethal effects of cumene hydroperoxide. Curcumin also showed good electron-transfer capability, with greater activity than trolox in aqueous solution. Curcumin can readily transfer electron or easily donate H-atom from two phenolic sites to scavenge free radicals. The excellent electron transfer capability of curcumin is because of its unique structure and different functional groups, including a β-diketone and several π electrons that have the capacity to conjugate between two phenyl rings. Therfore, since curcumin is inherently a lipophilic compound, because of its superb intracellular ROS scavenging activity, it can be used as an effective antioxidant for ROS protection within the polar cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1977828508,"Frontal and temporal language areas involved in syntactic processing are connected by several dorsal and ventral tracts, but the functional roles of the different tracts are not well understood. To identify which white matter tract(s) are important for syntactic processing, we examined the relationship between white matter damage and syntactic deficits in patients with primary progressive aphasia, using multimodal neuroimaging and neurolinguistic assessment. Diffusion tensor imaging showed that microstructural damage to left hemisphere dorsal tracts--the superior longitudinal fasciculus including its arcuate component--was strongly associated with deficits in comprehension and production of syntax. Damage to these dorsal tracts predicted syntactic deficits after gray matter atrophy was taken into account, and fMRI confirmed that these tracts connect regions modulated by syntactic processing. In contrast, damage to ventral tracts--the extreme capsule fiber system or the uncinate fasciculus--was not associated with syntactic deficits. Our findings show that syntactic processing depends primarily on dorsal language tracts."
https://openalex.org/W2086399711,"Many animal species use a chromosome-based mechanism of sex determination, which has led to the coordinate evolution of dosage-compensation systems. Dosage compensation not only corrects the imbalance in the number of X chromosomes between the sexes but also is hypothesized to correct dosage imbalance within cells that is due to monoallelic X-linked expression and biallelic autosomal expression, by upregulating X-linked genes twofold (termed 'Ohno's hypothesis'). Although this hypothesis is well supported by expression analyses of individual X-linked genes and by microarray-based transcriptome analyses, it was challenged by a recent study using RNA sequencing and proteomics. We obtained new, independent RNA-seq data, measured RNA polymerase distribution and reanalyzed published expression data in mammals, C. elegans and Drosophila. Our analyses, which take into account the skewed gene content of the X chromosome, support the hypothesis of upregulation of expressed X-linked genes to balance expression of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2138945575,"Traditional neurological models of language were based on a single neural pathway (the dorsal pathway underpinned by the arcuate fasciculus).

The “Lichtheim 2” model was implemented by developing a new variety of computational model which reproduces and explains normal and patient data but also incorporates neuroanatomical information into its architecture.

A computational implementation of the classic Lichtheim language model Incorporation of ventral and dorsal “pathways” into the language model A formal simulation of classic and progressive types of aphasia Incorporation of neuroanatomical constraints into computational architecture The pioneering 19th century neurologists demonstrated that language is supported by a distributed network of cortical regions. Lichtheim, 1885Lichtheim L. On aphasia.Brain. 1885; 7: 433-485Crossref Google Scholar assimilated these ideas into a model that implicated left-hemisphere perisylvian and prefrontal regions, and proposed that these communicate with one another in order to generate language function. Lichtheim's model accounted for the main forms of language impairment following brain damage, explaining why lesions in different brain regions might produce different aphasic syndromes. One hundred twenty-five years after it was proposed, Lichtheim's model remains the main organizing framework for thinking about the neural basis of language and its pathologies for many researchers and clinicians. Despite its considerable and long-standing success, early critics noted the theory's lack of specificity regarding the functions computed by the different cortical regions. More recently it has become clear that a wealth of information needs to be incorporated including contemporary neuroscience data about the functional and structural anatomy of the language system. The current paper offers a new proposal about the neurocomputation of language that is similar in spirit to Lichtheim's enterprise but that incorporates new facts about the structure and function underpinning language. Specifically, we propose that single-word comprehension, production (speaking/naming) and repetition are supported by the interactive contributions of the dorsal and ventral language pathways.

We reconfigured the architectures employed in these purely computational models to better reflect our current state of knowledge about the actual neuroanatomy of the language system. With the resulting neuroanatomically-constrained computational model, we show how both classical and progressive forms of aphasia arise within this architecture and how it explains well-established lesion-symptom correlations for each form. We further demonstrate how the incorporation of neuroanatomy within an explicit neurocomputational formalism addresses the shortcomings of Lichtheim-era models. First, quantitative analysis of internal representations developed by the model allows the theorist to specify the nature of the functions computed by each brain region and to relate these to empirical observations from functional neuroimaging. Second, simulations of plasticity-related recovery offer explicit and testable hypotheses about the partial spontaneous recovery observed in many patients post damage. The classic neuroanatomical model of language is dominated by the “dorsal” language pathway, in which perisylvian language areas, such as posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG), inferior supramarginal gyrus (iSMG), and inferior frontal gyrus (iFG), are connected via the arcuate fasciculus (AF) (Eggert, 1977Eggert G.H.

Most proposals suggest that there is at least some specialization of function in each pathway, with the dorsal pathway capturing the sound-to-motor statistical structure in a given language (Hickok and Poeppel, 2007Hickok G.

In contrast, the ventral pathway is associated with lexical-semantic influences on word repetition (Nozari et al., 2010Nozari N. Kittredge A.K. Dell G.S. Schwartz M.F. Naming and repetition in aphasia: Steps, routes, and frequency effects.J. Mem. Lang. 2010; 63: 541-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and relatedly, this pathway is crucial in the extraction of meaning from the acoustic-phonological input (Hickok and Poeppel, 2007Hickok G.

The implemented dual-pathway model permits a formal consideration of how this region and its associated processing fit into the larger language network, and also provides a crucial test of the face validity of the underlying computational and neuroanatomical assumptions. The model also licenses a unique opportunity to probe the computations performed within each “region,” as well as their interactions directly. By marrying computation and neuroanatomy in this way, the resultant neurocomputational model provides a foundation for understanding the neural basis of aphasia as well as a framework for simulating functional neuroimaging results (both of which require a bridge between anatomy and behavior). Using techniques and methods from prior work, we reformulated the architecture of purely computational models of language in order to mirror the dual pathway neuroanatomy, more faithfully. We tested the resulting “neurocomputational” model for its ability to synthesize normal language behaviors (speaking/naming, comprehending, and repeating). With a successful model in place, we were then able to probe each “neuroanatomical” element of the framework in order to undercover its function and the interaction between the two pathways. The dual-pathway hypothesis has emerged in the context of contemporary tractography, functional neuroimaging, and aphasiological data (Hickok and Poeppel, 2007Hickok G. Poeppel D.

We explored, therefore, how chronic (stroke-related) and progressive (semantic dementia) forms of aphasia emerge after damage to the Lichtheim 2 neurocomputational model. In addition, we also addressed the emerging view that chronic patient performance reflects the combination of damage and partial recovery processes, which might follow from a reweighting of neural connections in order to reoptimize the remaining computational capacity (Lambon Ralph, 2010Lambon Ralph M.A. Measuring language recovery in the underlying large-scale neural network: Pulling together in the face of adversity.Ann.

The rise of sophisticated structural and functional neuroimaging has spawned a wealth of new information about (1), the computations associated with different parts of the language network; and (2), the nature of patients' impaired language function after different locations of damage. We tested the model's ability to capture and explain a high-profile example of each type: (1), the acoustic/phonological-to-semantic transformation of information along the ventral, rostral pathway (Griffiths, 2002Griffiths T.D. Central auditory processing disorders.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2002; 15: 31-33PubMed Google Scholar, Scott et al., 2000Scott S.K. Blank C.C. Rosen S. Wise R.J.S. Identification of a pathway for intelligible speech in the left temporal lobe.Brain. 2000; 123: 2400-2406Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar) by undertaking an analysis of the changing similarity-structure encoded at different points along the ventral pathway; and (2), by assessing the rate of semantic speaking/naming errors after different lesion locations, we tested whether the peak semantic error rate follows from damage to the anterior STG as demonstrated in a recent voxel-symptom lesion mapping study (Schwartz et al., 2009Schwartz M.F. Kimberg D.Y. Walker G.M. Faseyitan O. Brecher A. Dell G.S. Coslett H.B. Anterior temporal involvement in semantic word retrieval: voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping evidence from aphasia.Brain. 2009; 132: 3411-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In turn, by probing and understanding the nature of the information coding in this region, the model provided insights about why lesions in this, but not other locations, generate a maximal number of semantic errors. Although there is clear and emerging evidence of dual language pathways in the human brain, neurocomputational models allow us to test the functioning of different possible architectures (for a parallel computational comparison with respect to naming and repetition in aphasia see Nozari et al., 2010Nozari N. Kittredge A.K. Dell G.S. Schwartz M.F. Naming and repetition in aphasia: Steps, routes, and frequency effects.J. Mem. Lang. 2010; 63: 541-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). By implementing a single-pathway architecture and comparing it with the dual-pathway model, we were able to explore why it might be beneficial for the real brain to utilize dual, interactive pathways for language. Figure 1 shows the neuroanatomically-constrained architecture of the dual-pathway model (see Experimental Procedures; see Figure S1 available online for further details). This includes a dorsal pathway (primary auditory ↔ inferior supramarginal gyrus ↔ insular-motor cortex: underpinned by the arcuate fasciculus) and a ventral pathway (primary auditory ↔ mid-STG ↔ anterior-STG ↔ opercularis-triangularis ↔ insular-motor cortex: underpinned by the middle longitudinal fasciculus and the extreme capsule). Via a connection to the aSTG, we also incorporated the ventral anterior temporal region (vATL), which has been shown by functional neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies to be crucial to verbal and nonverbal comprehension (Binney et al., 2010Binney R.J. Embleton K.V. Jefferies E. Parker G.J.M.

The model was trained to speak/name, repeat and comprehend a set of 1710 multisyllabic Japanese words (incorporating time-varying input and outputs, as well as other computationally-challenging characteristics of language; see Experimental Procedures). Figure 2 shows the developmental trajectory of the network on these tasks as a function of word-frequency. Like children, the model demonstrated different acquisition functions for each task with repetition preceding comprehension and comprehension preceding speaking/naming. In its trained, “adult” state, the model was able to repeat all of the words from the training set, other untrained real words (i.e., real Japanese words that were not included in the training set) and a set of nonwords (i.e., legitimate Japanese phonemic nonword sequences which, inevitably, had lower phonotactic and bi-mora frequency than the untrained real words), with performance comparing closely to human data (see Figure S2). In summary, the implemented dorsal-ventral neurocomputational model proved to be a fully-functional model compatible with adult and children's language performance.Figure 2Accuracy of the Network on Three Language Tasks as a Function of LearningShow full captionThe y axis error bars show the standard errors across five simulations.

Generalization of repetition was tested using both untrained items (real Japanese words) as well as novel tri-mora items (Japanese nonwords) for direct comparison with human participants. See also Figure S2. Figure 3 summarizes the effect of simulated lesions to the different regions (representational layers) in the model. Performance was assessed with 60 high frequency and 60 low frequency words (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). Fifteen levels of damage severity were simulated in each region. Most forms of lesion or atrophy include damage to both gray matter and the underlying white matter. Accordingly, simulated damage included both the addition of noise to the unit outputs as an analog of gray matter pathology (ranging from 0.01 to 0.15 in equal intervals) and removal of the incoming links to the damaged layer as an analog of white matter damage (ranging from 0.5% to 7.5% in equal intervals). Several classic (stroke) and progressive aphasias were synthesized. Figures 3A–3E summarize the impact of lesions to the posterior perisylvian region (with the lesion focus shifting in a caudal-inferior, “clockwise” fashion). Damage to the insular-motor layer led to reproduction conduction aphasia (impaired spoken output with preserved comprehension) and a similar pattern was generated when the lesion covered the insular-motor and iSMG layers (Figures 3A and 3B). The selective pattern of STM/repetition conduction aphasia (Shallice and Warrington, 1977Shallice T. Warrington E.K. Auditory-verbal short-term memory impairment and conduction aphasia.Brain Lang. 1977; 4: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) followed from isolated iSMG lesioning (Figure 3C) although with greater levels of damage both speaking/naming and repetition were compromised. Taken together, these simulations might explain the apparent rarity of STM/repetition over reproduction conduction aphasia, in that repetition-selective deficits only arise in the context of isolated and mild lesions to the iSMG layer. Overall, these simulations mirror the association between conduction aphasia and damage to the dorsal pathway observed in real patients (Fridriksson et al., 2010Fridriksson J. Kjartansson O.

Aphasia: progress in the last quarter of a century.Neurology. 2007; 69: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Wernicke's aphasia (severely impaired comprehension combined with moderate-to-severe impairments of speaking/naming and repetition) is associated with damage centered on the pSTG and surrounding region (Hillis, 2007Hillis A.E. Aphasia: progress in the last quarter of a century.Neurology. 2007; 69: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Damage to the corresponding part of the model (the acoustic-phonological input layer ± additional damage to the iSMG) resulted in exactly this behavioral pattern (Figures 3D and 3E). In contrast, lesions in iFG are known to result in a Broca-type/transcortical motor aphasia (Hillis, 2007Hillis A.E. Aphasia: progress in the last quarter of a century.Neurology. 2007; 69: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) characterized, in the context of single-word processing, in terms of relatively good comprehension, impaired repetition and severely affected speaking/naming. Exactly this pattern followed in the model after damage to the corresponding region (the triangularis-opercularis layer; see Figure 3G). The final target was semantic dementia, epitomized by intact repetition with severely impaired comprehension and speaking/naming, especially for low-frequency words (Hodges et al., 1992Hodges J.R.

However, it is not clear to what extent this type of reprogramming is able to generate fully functional differentiated cells. In addition, the activity of the reprogrammed cells in cell transplantation assays, such as those envisaged for cell-based therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD), remains to be determined. Here we show that ectopic expression of defined transcription factors in mouse tail tip fibroblasts is sufficient to induce Pitx3+ neurons that closely resemble midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. In addition, transplantation of these induced DA (iDA) neurons alleviates symptoms in a mouse model of PD. Thus, iDA neurons generated from abundant somatic fibroblasts by direct lineage reprogramming hold promise for modeling neurodegenerative disease and for cell-based therapies of PD."

These uni- and multisensory cortical changes may facilitate the detection and discrimination of pup distress calls and strengthen the bond between mothers and their neonates. Pup odors shape sensory coding in the auditory cortex of mothers Multisensory integration between odors and sounds is experience dependent Plasticity is tuned to increase the representations of pup ultrasonic vocalizations In rodents, the interaction between a mother and her neonates is mediated by a set of characterized sounds emitted by pups that elicit specific maternal behaviors (Ehret, 2005Ehret G. Infant rodent ultrasounds—A gate to the understanding of sound communication.Behav. Genet. 2005; 35: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For example, wriggling calls (WCs) are emitted by mouse pups struggling in the nest. The mother responds by licking the pups, changing her nursing position, and reorganizing the nest (Ehret, 1975Ehret G. Call signals of mice (Mus musculus).Behaviour. 1975; 52: 38-56Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Ehret and Riecke, 2002Ehret G. Riecke S. Mice and humans perceive multiharmonic communication sounds in the same way.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A second example are the ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) produced by young pups that are unable to maintain their body temperature when they are isolated from the nest (Noirot, 1966Noirot E. Ultra-sounds in young rodents. I. Changes with age in albino mice.Anim. Behav. 1966; 14: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, Sewell, 1970Sewell G.D. Ultrasonic communication in rodents.Nature. 1970; 227: 410Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These distress calls alert the mother, which prompts her to search for and retrieve the isolated pup back to the nest (Haack et al., 1983Haack B. Markl H. Ehret G. Sound Communication between Parents and Offspring. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield1983Google Scholar, Sewell, 1970Sewell G.D. Ultrasonic communication in rodents.Nature. 1970; 227: 410Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Both WC- and USV-induced maternal behaviors are a hallmark of rodent mothers but not of naive virgins (Leuner et al., 2010Leuner B. Glasper E.R. Gould E. Parenting and plasticity.Trends Neurosci. 2010; 33: 465-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, Noirot, 1972Noirot E. Ultrasounds and maternal behavior in small rodents.Dev. Psychobiol. 1972; 5: 371-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Maternal behaviors can be regulated by stimuli of different sensory modalities. Olfaction, for example, is a central sense by which rodents communicate with each other. Indeed, pup odors efficiently trigger maternal behaviors and inform the mother of the presence of her pups (Lévy and Keller, 2009Lévy F. Keller M. Olfactory mediation of maternal behavior in selected mammalian species.Behav. Brain Res. 2009; 200: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, Lévy et al., 2004Lévy F. Keller M. Poindron P.

Zachman T.A. Maternal responses to infant vocalizations and olfactory cues in rats and mice.Behav. Biol. 1974; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Thus, mothers use both auditory and olfactory cues to identify and locate their pups. Because pup calls are always perceived by a lactating mother in an environment enriched with the scent of her pups, it may learn the contingency between these different stimuli. Although there is ample behavioral evidence supporting the value of each sense separately, the merging of these senses in a natural context has not been studied. Even less is known about how neurons respond to multisensory stimuli either before or after maternal associations form. We hypothesized that the odors of pups will modulate the way pup calls are processed by the mothers. Given that the primary auditory cortex (A1) is involved in auditory object recognition and is a known site of neuronal plasticity (Miranda and Liu, 2009Miranda J.A. Liu R.C.

Neurosci. 2004; 5: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), we tested whether it serves as an early processing station for multisensory integration of pup odors and pup calls. To test this hypothesis, we introduced pup odors to both naive and experienced female mice while monitoring the spiking output of neurons in A1. We found that pup odors triggered robust modulation of auditory processing only in females that interacted with pups. This olfactory-auditory integration had a particularly strong effect on detection and discrimination of pup distress calls, suggesting that it is experience dependent. Using in vivo cell-attached recordings, we monitored both spontaneous and sound-evoked neuronal activity in A1 of anesthetized female mice. We chose this configuration because it is an unbiased sampling technique that provides stable recordings with excellent single unit isolation for long durations (DeWeese et al., 2003DeWeese M.R. Wehr M. Zador A.M. Binary spiking in auditory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7940-7949PubMed Google Scholar, Hromádka et al., 2008Hromádka T. Deweese M.R. Zador A.M. Sparse representation of sounds in the unanesthetized auditory cortex.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e16Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Single-cell response profiles allowed us to monitor whether and how pup odors modulated sound processing (Figure 1A ). In total, we recorded 471 neurons from 60 mice (see Table S1 available online). We first surveyed spontaneous activity and pure tone responses in two experimental groups: primiparous “lactating mothers” (PD4; postpartum day 4) and age-matched naive virgins. In lactating mothers, a continuous presentation of pup odors induced notable alterations of spontaneous firing rates (increases or decreases) in A1 neurons, which recovered within less than 10 min after odor stimulation offset (Figure 1B). Only long (several dozens of seconds) exposure to the pup odors induced evident changes in spiking activity. To rule out the possibility that these slow changes may be simply a result of a slow buildup of responses in the olfactory epithelium, we carried out EOG recordings from the axonal nerve in between the nasal epithelium and the olfactory bulb while presenting pup odors. Pup odor presentation induced rapid (<10 s) onset and offset axonal responses of olfactory receptor axons (data not shown), suggesting that although odor responses in the olfactory system are fast, A1 cortical changes are slow. In addition, spiking activity in A1 was not synchronized to the breathing cycle (data not shown), further ruling out the possibility of fast and direct synaptic interaction between olfactory inputs and auditory neurons. On a slower time scale, pup odors robustly altered the tone-evoked responses of neurons in lactating mothers. For example, we encountered a few neurons that did not respond significantly to any of the pure tones while the animal was presented with clear air (Figure 1C, air1 and air2), but then showed robust responses to a narrow range of tones during pup odor stimulation (Figure 1C, pup odors). Pup odor-mediated auditory responses normally returned to baseline after termination of the odor stimulation (Figure 1C, air3). We systematically recorded from neurons with different baseline responses and tested how these changed during pup odor stimulation. Pup odors affected different parameters of sound-evoked responses, such as response probability, latency to respond, and response bandwidth (Figures 1C and 1D and see Figure S1 for 10 more examples of neurons from lactating mothers). Here, we describe and quantify odor-induced changes only in terms of spontaneous and sound-evoked spike rates. Pup odors induced alterations (increases or decreases) of spontaneous and/or tone-evoked spike rates (and combinations thereof) in the majority of neurons from lactating mothers. To describe how pup odors modulated auditory responses, we plotted the average firing rate of each neuron we recorded under both “air” and “odor” conditions. Data from lactating mothers and several control groups are plotted in Figure 2A. Firing rate values for spontaneous and evoked periods are plotted separately (Figure 2A, left and right columns, respectively). Data points that fall on the diagonal correspond to neurons that experienced no change between the air and odor conditions (Figure 2A). Accordingly, neurons above or below the diagonal increased or decreased their firing rates in the presence of pup odors. As shown in Figure 2A, pup odors induce changes largely in neurons from lactating mothers (Figure 2A, third row). To quantify the changes in spontaneous and evoked spike rates, we calculated an index of modulation for each neuron ([modulation index] = [(spike ratepup odor – spike rateair)/(spike ratepup odor + spike rateair)]). Pup odors induced significant modulation of spontaneous and sound-evoked spike rates specifically in A1 of lactating mothers (Figure 2B, closed bar, “pup odors A1”). In contrast, neurons from naive virgins were not affected by pup odor stimulation (Figures 2A and 2B, open bars, compare “pup odors A1” and “no odor A1”). To verify that odors of the pups rather than other associated odors are indeed the source of changes, we also tested two control odorants—a strong unfamiliar odorant (0.1% acetophenone) and odors from the nesting material (cotton wool and wood shaving volatile odorants). Unlike pup odors, neither acetophenone nor nesting material affected neuronal spiking activity in lactating mothers (Figures 2A and 2B, closed bars, “acetophenone A1” and “nesting material A1”). These data reveal that neurons in A1 of lactating mothers integrate between olfactory and auditory cues. The robust nature of the pup odor-induced changes suggests that after pregnancy, parturition, and/or maternal experience, olfactory cues may act as a context-switch during which the neocortical network is transiently reorganized. Because lactating mothers are known to be in an upregulated hormonal state (Brunton and Russell, 2008Brunton P.J. Russell J.A. The expectant brain: Adapting for motherhood.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, Mann and Bridges, 2001Mann P.E. Bridges R.S. Lactogenic hormone regulation of maternal behavior.Prog. Brain Res. 2001; 133: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we tested whether our findings were the result of a global modulation of neuronal activity throughout the neocortex. To this end, we recorded from the somatosensory cortex (S1-barrel field) of lactating mothers before, during, and after pup odor stimulation. In S1, pup odors did not induce changes in either spontaneous activity or air puff-evoked responses (Figures 2A and 2B, closed bar, “pup odors S1”). Although we did not examine other cortical regions, this result indicates that under our experimental conditions, pup odors do not induce global changes in neuronal activity across the neocortex. To further test whether pup odor induced a general physiological arousal, we monitored both heart and breathing rates (n = 5 mice). Neither heart nor breathing rates showed any consistent change during pup odor presentation (data not shown), suggesting that pup odors do not modulate the arousal levels of lactating mothers (at least not in the anesthetized state). We next asked what triggers the plastic changes in A1 of lactating mothers. Are changes persistent? What impact do they have on the processing of natural sounds that are behaviorally relevant to mothers? To address these questions, we tested two additional experimental groups: “experienced virgins” and “mothers following weaning.” “Experienced virgins” are virgins that joined the cage of a primiparous lactating mother and her pups for 4 days starting immediately after parturition (tested at the end of this 4 day period), a priming known to trigger pup retrieval behavior (Ehret et al., 1987Ehret G. Koch M. Haack B. Markl H. Sex and parental experience determine the onset of an instinctive behavior in mice.Naturwissenschaften. 1987; 74: 47Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, Noirot, 1972Noirot E. Ultrasounds and maternal behavior in small rodents.Dev. Psychobiol. 1972; 5: 371-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). We used this group to test whether olfactory-auditory integration can be instigated in naive virgins by direct interaction with pups, independent of pregnancy and parturition. “Mothers following weaning” are primiparous mothers 1 week after the weaning of and separation from their pups (at PD28). We used this group to test whether the olfactory-auditory integration is a long-lasting phenomenon that is still manifested in experienced mothers when the estrus cycle has been fully restored. Notably, mothers following weaning have recently been shown to process natural calls differently than naive virgins (Galindo-Leon et al., 2009Galindo-Leon E.E. Lin F.G. Liu R.C.

Auditory cortical detection and discrimination correlates with communicative significance.PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e173Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), prompting the question whether olfactory-auditory integration contributes to the known repertoire of changes in these animals. We first compared the behavioral performance of these two additional experimental groups to those of lactating mothers and naive virgins. In a pup retrieval behavioral assay, all animals that had previous interaction with pups retrieved all the pups back to the nest, while only naive virgins did not retrieve any of the pups (Figure 3A ; Movie S1, Movie S2, Movie S3, and Movie S4). Thus, the pup retrieval behavior is independent of pregnancy and parturition because it is evident in experienced virgins. In addition, this behavior is maintained for the long term even after the mice are no longer engaged in it, as evident in mothers following weaning. Notably, however, lactating mothers were still more efficient than the other groups at retrieving their pups back to the nest (Figure 3B; Movie S1, Movie S2, Movie S3, and Movie S4). To challenge the impact of pup odors on retrieval behavior in lactating mothers, we manipulated pup odors by washing the pups. We reasoned that simply washing the pups with warm water may perturb the natural odor emitted from a pup (at least transiently) but will not affect its vocalizations. Interestingly, washing the pups prior to the bioassay hindered pup retrieval performance in lactating mothers (Figure 3; Movie S5). Only 60% of lactating mothers retrieved washed pups back to the nest (Figure 3A). Furthermore, even when lactating mothers retrieved the washed pups, they did so slower than they retrieved untreated pups. This experiment suggests that pup odor is a powerful cue triggering this behavior. Notably, this result is consistent with a careful behavioral study conducted more than three decades ago (Smotherman et al., 1974Smotherman W.P. Bell R.W. Starzec J. Elias J. Zachman T.A. Maternal responses to infant vocalizations and olfactory cues in rats and mice.Behav. Biol. 1974; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Next we compared the effects of pup odor stimulation on sound processing in A1 of all four experimental groups (i.e., naive virgins, lactating mothers, mothers following weaning, and experienced virgins). In these experiments, we recorded the spike response profiles to a series of sounds composed of broad band noise (BBN) and natural sounds known to be salient to mothers, such as artificial WCs and recorded USVs, (Ehret, 2005Ehret G. Infant rodent ultrasounds—A gate to the understanding of sound communication.Behav. Genet. 2005; 35: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, Ehret and Riecke, 2002Ehret G. Riecke S. Mice and humans perceive multiharmonic communication sounds in the same way.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures for the full stimulus array). As expected from the pure tone experiments, pup odors altered both spontaneous and sound-evoked spike rates of neurons in lactating mothers but not in naive virgins (Figure 4). In lactating mothers, pup odor effects were frequent but heterogeneous. Increases or decreases in evoked spike rates were evident, as well as changes in the sensitivity to stimulus intensity (Figure 4A, left top). Here, too, the heterogeneous effects of pup odor stimulation were largely transient (e.g., see Figure S2 for three complete examples from a lactating mother). Remarkably, pup odor stimulation also induced marked changes in neurons from experienced virgins and mothers following weaning, affecting both spontaneous and sound-evoked spike rates (Figure 4 and see Figures S3A–S3D for 16 additional neurons from the various experimental groups). Because pup odors had diverse effects on both spontaneous and sound-evoked spike rates, each neuron could have a different combinatorial effect that will determine the exact effect on the neuron's sound detectability (see Figure S3E for examples). Sound detectability is calculated here as the ratio between evoked and spontaneous spike rates (evoked/spontaneous). Detectability >1 implies that the neuron is excited by the auditory stimulus (increase its spike rate). Detectability <1 implies that the neuron is inhibited by the auditory stimulus (decrease its spike rate). The larger the ratio, the stronger the neurons' detectability. To asses how pup odors modulated detectability, we plotted this ratio for each neuron under both conditions (Figure 5A ). To quantify these changes, we calculated an index of how detectability was modulated (modulation index = (detectabilitypup odor – detectabilityair)/(detectabilitypup odor + detectabilityair); Figure 5). The average modulation index of all experimental groups having previous experience with pups was slightly higher and more variable as compared to naive virgins, but not significantly (Figures 5A and 5B). Notably, this analysis may underestimate the size of the effect, where averages are considered. For example, neurons with altered receptive fields that were modulated in a nonhomogeneous manner might have a low modulation index score because for some stimuli the response decreased whereas for others it increased (see for example in Figure S1, two bottom neurons; Figure S3B, left neuron; and Figure S3C, second neuron from left, and see below). To study whether neurons in specific laminae were particularly affected, we tested whether the modulation index of detectability was more prominent in a given depth in the cortex. We found no systematic variation between neurons from upper layers as compared to neurons from deeper layers (data not shown; but see Discussion for reservations). Next, we analyzed whether a particular cell type was more prone to be affected by pup odors. Because fast spiking neurons (FSNs) have been implicated in regulating global network state, response gain, and attention-dependent response modulation (Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F.

Bidirectional plasticity in fast-spiking GABA circuits by visual experience.Nature. 2009; 462: 218-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we analyzed odor-induced changes for these neurons separately. By using spike waveforms, we differentiated between regular spiking neurons (RSNs, mostly pyramidal neurons) and FSNs (Figure 5C; Niell and Stryker, 2008Niell C.M. Stryker M.P. Highly selective receptive fields in mouse visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7520-7536Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). FSNs made up approximately 10% of our data set (28/298 neurons) (Markram et al., 2004Markram H. Toledo-Rodriguez M. Wang Y. Gupta A. Silberberg G. Wu C. Interneurons of the neocortical inhibitory system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). All FSNs recorded in lactating mothers that were responsive to sounds (n = 6 neurons) increased their sound detectability in the presence of pup odors (Figure 5D). Electrophysiological data from all these six FSNs is presented in the different figures (Figure 5D, rasters; Figure 4A, left top; Figure S1, asterisks; and Figure S3E ii, iii). Notably, similar effects were observed for experienced virgins and mothers following weaning but not in naive virgins (Figure 5D, red bars). The comprehensive nature of this effect suggests that FSNs may play a key role in the regulation of the plastic changes occurring in A1 of females exposed to pups. Although the pup retrieval behavior was evident in all animals after maternal experience, lactating mothers were significantly faster at retrieving the pups (Figure 3B). Consistent with these results, and independent of the olfactory-auditory integration, a significantly higher percentage of neurons from lactating mothers responded to at least one sound (Figure 6A , left; Table S1). This increase was significant when considering both responses to pure tones and to natural sounds separately (Figure 6A, middle and right). Because this amplified response of the population to sounds is not evident in experienced virgins, it could not be explained by mere exposure to pup odors. Because this increase also did not appear in mothers following weaning, we consider it to be a transient effect. This transient effect may well be associated with the transient endocrinal changes that occur during pregnancy and after parturition (Brunton and Russell, 2008Brunton P.J. Russell J.A. The expectant brain: Adapting for motherhood.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 11-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, Miranda and Liu, 2009Miranda J.A. Liu R.C. Dissecting natural sensory plasticity: Hormones and experience in a maternal context.Hear. Res. 2009; 252: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because different sounds bear different behavioral meanings, we analyzed how the different sounds (two different natural sounds and one reference nonnatural sound) were represented in A1 of all four experimental groups. BBN and WCs were overrepresented by ∼2-fold in lactating mothers as compared to all other groups (Figure 6B, left and middle). USVs were considerably overrepresented (by ∼10-fold) in lactating mothers relative to their representation in naive virgins (Figure 6B, right). Interestingly, USVs were also overrepresented (by ∼4-fold, relative to their representation in naive virgins) in experienced virgins and in mothers following weaning, albeit still significantly lower than in lactating mothers (Figure 6B, right). This analysis indicated that maternal-induced plasticity may facilitate responses to specific sounds rather than act as a general gain control to the whole circuit. Therefore, we next analyzed whether the olfactory-auditory integration also induced specific effects on the detection and discrimination of the sounds we presented. To that end, we isolated the effects of pup odors on BBN-, WC-, and USV-evoked responses in lactating mothers (this analysis was limited to this group because of the relatively low sample size of neurons responding to USV stimuli in all other groups; Table S2). Pup odors did not significantly affect the average detectability of neurons to BBN and WC stimuli because some neurons increased and others decreased their detectability (Figure 6C). In contrast, pup odors had a more homogeneous effect on responses to USV stimuli. Specifically, pup odors induced consistent increase for USV detectability in most neurons (Figure 6C; Table S2). For example, 12/15 neurons from lactating mothers increased their responses to USVs (Figure 6D, neurons marked with arrows pointing upwards, and Figure 4A, top left). These analyses indicate that the multisensory cortical changes in lactating mothers may promote high acuity to this specific, context-dependent stimulus as we discuss next. In this work we found that motherhood is associated with an appearance of multisensory cortical processing in A1 that was not evident during virginity. We show that neurons in A1 of mothers and other care givers integrate between pup odors and sounds. This multisensory integration was evident in animals that had previous interaction with pups, suggesting that this plasticity is experience dependent. We further demonstrate that this multisensory integration enhances the detection of USVs in A1. It is well accepted that the cerebral cortex processes multisensory cues (Ghazanfar and Schroeder, 2006Ghazanfar A.A. Schroeder C.E. Is neocortex essentially multisensory?.Trends Cogn. Sci. (Regul.

In the auditory cortex (including in A1), both imaging and electrophysiological studies revealed that neurons integrate auditory-visual or auditory-somatosensory cues (Bizley et al., 2007Bizley J.K.

We find that, as a population, spike trains of single units in primary vibrissa motor cortex report the absolute angle of vibrissa position. This representation persists after sensory nerve transection, indicating an efferent source. About two-thirds of the units are modulated by slow variations in the envelope of whisking, while relatively few units report rapid changes in position within the whisk cycle. The combined results from this study and past measurements, which show that primary sensory cortex codes the whisking envelope as a motor copy signal, imply that signals present in both sensory and motor cortices are necessary to compute angular coordinates based on vibrissa touch."

How different fates are established in the daughter cells of these progenitors is poorly understood. During early phases of mouse brain development (E9.0), the cortex consists of neuroepithelial progenitors (NEPs), which extend from the ventricular (apical) to the pial (basal) surface of the neural tube and divide symmetrically to amplify the progenitor pool. At the onset of neurogenesis (around E11.0), NEPs turn into so-called radial glial cells (RGCs) and adopt molecular and morphological characteristics of glial cells. RGCs are characterized by an apical fiber extending toward the ventricle and a basal fiber extending toward the pial surface (Caviness et al., 2009Caviness Jr., V.S. Nowakowski R.S. Bhide P.G.

RGCs occupy the most apical area of the cortex, called the ventricular zone (VZ). Their nuclei undergo a characteristic interkinetic nuclear migration where mitosis and S phase occur in the apical and basal areas of the VZ, respectively. RGCs give rise to all the cortical neurons through two kinds of asymmetric divisions (Anthony et al., 2004Anthony T.E. Klein C. Fishell G. Heintz N.

Either, they divide into one RGC and another cell that migrates into the more basally located cortical plate (CP) where it differentiates into a neuron. Alternatively, RGCs generate one RGC and one intermediate progenitor cell (IPC). IPCs (also called basal progenitors [BPs] or nonsurface-dividing [NS-div] cells) lose their connection to the apical surface and reside in the cortical area between the VZ and intermediate zone (IZ) where they form the so-called subventricular zone (SVZ). IPCs undergo one to two rounds of symmetric division, generating either one or two pairs of neurons (Haubensak et al., 2004Haubensak W. Attardo A. Denk W. Huttner W.B.

As the gene expression profiles of RGCs generating neurons are characteristically different from the ones generating IPCs (Pinto et al., 2008Pinto L. Mader M.T. Irmler M. Gentilini M. Santoni F. Drechsel D. Blum R. Stahl R. Bulfone A. Malatesta P. et al.Prospective isolation of functionally distinct radial glial subtypes—lineage and transcriptome analysis.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2008; 38: 15-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the two modes of division seem to occur in distinct subpopulations of RGCs. Whether or not the orientation of RGC divisions is relevant for neurogenesis has been a matter of intense debate. Early reports have demonstrated that vertical spindle orientation correlates with an asymmetric outcome in terms of daughter cell fates (Chenn and McConnell, 1995Chenn A. McConnell S.K. Cleavage orientation and the asymmetric inheritance of Notch1 immunoreactivity in mammalian neurogenesis.Cell. 1995; 82: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, Zhong and Chia, 2008Zhong W. Chia W. Neurogenesis and asymmetric cell division.Curr. Opin.

Chia W. Neurogenesis and asymmetric cell division.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, mitotic spindles with vertical orientations are only found during the neurogenic phases of brain development (Haydar et al., 2003Haydar T.F. Ang Jr., E. Rakic P. Mitotic spindle rotation and mode of cell division in the developing telencephalon.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 2890-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), while during the early expansion phase, keeping precise horizontal spindle orientation is crucial to maintain the neural progenitor pool (Fish et al., 2006Fish J.L. Kosodo Y. Enard W. Pääbo S. Huttner W.B. Aspm specifically maintains symmetric proliferative divisions of neuroepithelial cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Asymmetric distribution of the apical plasma membrane during neurogenic divisions of mammalian neuroepithelial cells.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2314-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This could be explained by the small size of the apical membrane domain of RGCs, such that even barely oblique mitotic spindles would give rise to cleavage planes that fail to bisect this domain resulting in its asymmetric segregation (Kosodo et al., 2004Kosodo Y. Röper K. Haubensak W. Marzesco A.M. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Asymmetric distribution of the apical plasma membrane during neurogenic divisions of mammalian neuroepithelial cells.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2314-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that increasing the rate of vertical divisions can affect progenitor cell number and location (Konno et al., 2008Konno D. Shioi G. Shitamukai A. Mori A. Kiyonari H. Miyata T.

Neurosci. 2011; 31: 3683-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Functional evidence to demonstrate that either vertical or oblique spindle orientation is required for neurogenesis, however, remains to be established. The molecular machinery for spindle orientation during neurogenesis is best understood in Drosophila (Siller and Doe, 2009Siller K.H. Doe C.Q. Spindle orientation during asymmetric cell division.Nat.

In neuroblasts, the mitotic spindle is oriented by two protein complexes that assemble on its apical cell cortex. One complex consists of the PDZ domain proteins Par-3, Par-6, and the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) while the other contains the GoLoco domain protein Pins, the heterotrimeric G protein subunit GαI, and the microtubule-binding protein Mushroom body defect (Mud). These two complexes are linked by an adaptor protein called Inscuteable (Insc). Insc can bind to both Pins (Schaefer et al., 2000Schaefer M. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Knoblich J.A.

In insc mutants, mitotic spindles in neuroblasts are randomly oriented, leading to missegregation of cell fate determinants, and thus, cell fate defects in the developing nervous system. When Insc is ectopically expressed in epithelial cells, Pins and Mud are recruited from the basolateral to the apical cortex, and the mitotic spindle reorients from a horizontal into an apical-basal direction. Therefore, unlike all other components, Insc is not only required but also sufficient for spindle orientation along the apical-basal axis. While the components of the Drosophila spindle orientation machinery are conserved in mammals, they have been studied mainly with regard to their roles in epithelial cell polarity (Goldstein and Macara, 2007Goldstein B.

Mammalian Par-3, Par-6, and aPKC are important for spindle orientation, and—like their Drosophila counterparts—they are also required for epithelial apical-basal polarity. Pins has two mammalian homologs, AGS-3 and LGN (Sanada and Tsai, 2005Sanada K. Tsai L.H.

AGS-3 does not appear to be expressed in the brain at significant levels, and AGS3 knockout mice show no brain phenotype (Blumer et al., 2008Blumer J.B. Lord K. Saunders T.L. Pacchioni A. Black C.

By contrast, LGN mediates planar spindle orientation in the developing brain (Konno et al., 2008Konno D. Shioi G. Shitamukai A. Mori A. Kiyonari H. Miyata T. Matsuzaki F.

Similarly, the mammalian Mud homolog NuMA has been shown to play a conserved role in the spindle orientation complex (Du and Macara, 2004Du Q. Macara I.G. Mammalian Pins is a conformational switch that links NuMA to heterotrimeric G proteins.Cell. 2004; 119: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) but has additional functions in organizing a bipolar mitotic spindle (Silk et al., 2009Silk A.D.

Role of NuMA in vertebrate cells: review of an intriguing multifunctional protein.Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Insc is conserved in vertebrates. Overexpression and RNAi studies have shown that the protein is involved in orienting the mitotic spindle in the rat retina (Zigman et al., 2005Zigman M. Cayouette M. Charalambous C. Schleiffer A. Hoeller O. Dunican D. McCudden C.R. Firnberg N. Barres B.A. Siderovski D.P. Knoblich J.A. Mammalian inscuteable regulates spindle orientation and cell fate in the developing retina.Neuron. 2005; 48: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and a similar function has been postulated in the mouse skin (Lechler and Fuchs, 2005Lechler T. Fuchs E. Asymmetric cell divisions promote stratification and differentiation of mammalian skin.Nature. 2005; 437: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Moreover, in situ hybridization experiments showed that mouse Inscuteable (mInsc) is expressed in the developing neocortex at the time when the first neurons start to appear (Zigman et al., 2005Zigman M. Cayouette M. Charalambous C. Schleiffer A. Hoeller O. Dunican D. McCudden C.R. Firnberg N. Barres B.A. Siderovski D.P. Knoblich J.A. Mammalian inscuteable regulates spindle orientation and cell fate in the developing retina.Neuron. 2005; 48: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To test the role of mInsc in cortical development, we have generated conditional knockout and overexpression mice. We measure spindle orientation in 3D and show that the fraction of oblique divisions increases or decreases upon mInsc overexpression or deletion, respectively. We show that loss of mInsc leads to defects in neurogenesis and depletion of BPs, while mInsc overexpression has the opposite effect. Our data are consistent with a model in which oblique divisions preferentially give rise to BPs and, therefore, suggest a mechanism regulating the balance between direct and indirect neurogenesis during mouse brain development. mInsc is expressed throughout the developing cortex during mid-neurogenesis (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1K ) (Zigman et al., 2005Zigman M. Cayouette M. Charalambous C. Schleiffer A. Hoeller O. Dunican D. McCudden C.R. Firnberg N. Barres B.A. Siderovski D.P. Knoblich J.A. Mammalian inscuteable regulates spindle orientation and cell fate in the developing retina.Neuron. 2005; 48: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the VZ, the protein is enriched at the spindle midzone in about 90% of the anaphase cells (yellow arrow in Figure 1C, and graph in Figure 1E). In 100% of the CP neurons, however, the protein is localized to the neuron cell body cytoplasm and concentrates on one side of the nucleus (yellow arrow in Figure 1D). To test whether mInsc can functionally replace the Drosophila protein, we generated transgenic flies expressing C-terminally myc-tagged mInsc (mInsc::myc). When expressed in neuroblasts, mInsc::myc localizes into an apical crescent (Figures 1F and 1G). Like Drosophila Insc (Kraut et al., 1996Kraut R. Chia W. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Knoblich J.A. Role of inscuteable in orienting asymmetric cell divisions in Drosophila.Nature. 1996; 383: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), mInsc::myc can induce a reorientation of the mitotic spindle into an apical-basal orientation when ectopically expressed in epithelial cells (Figures 1H and 1I). Thus, mInsc is a functional homolog of Drosophila Insc. To analyze the function of mInsc in mouse cortical development, we generated conditional loss-of-function and overexpression alleles (called mInscloxP and R26ki, respectively) (Figure 1J; see Figures S1A and S1B and Supplemental Experimental Procedures available online for details). Upon Cre recombination, the R26ki line lost β-gal expression and showed strong and ubiquitous expression of mInsc-GFP (R26mInsc::GFP) (Figure 1P). For brain-specific recombination we used NesCre8, which expresses Cre in the forebrain of E8.5 embryos (Petersen et al., 2002Petersen P.H. Zou K. Hwang J.K. Jan Y.N. Zhong W. Progenitor cell maintenance requires numb and numblike during mouse neurogenesis.Nature. 2002; 419: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). When combined with mInscloxP, this line results in near-complete removal of mInsc from the cortex at E14.5 (Figures 1K and 1L). We call the recombined allele mInscfl. Residual mInsc staining on the apical surface of the cortex (white arrow) is presumably due to truncated protein persistence or mosaic expression of Cre (Figure 1L). In addition we detected some nonspecific antibody staining around blood vessels (yellow arrow) that is not due to the secondary antibody (Figures S1F and 1G). When combined with the R26ki allele, NesCre8 caused loss of β-gal expression (compare Figure 1M with 1N), and strong expression of the GFP fusion protein (Figures 1O and 1P) in the entire cortex at E14.5. Expression of the GFP fusion protein can also be detected as a 90 kDa band in immunoblots from E13.5 heads (Figure 1Q). This band is found in addition to the 60 kDa band from the endogenous protein in NesCre/+;R26ki/ki but not in NesCre/+ or R26ki/ki mice (Figure 1Q). Thus, we have generated functional tools for gain- and loss-of-function analysis of mInsc. Previous RNAi experiments have suggested that the function of mInsc in controlling the orientation of neural precursor divisions is conserved from Drosophila to mice (Zigman et al., 2005Zigman M. Cayouette M. Charalambous C. Schleiffer A. Hoeller O. Dunican D. McCudden C.R. Firnberg N. Barres B.A. Siderovski D.P. Knoblich J.A. Mammalian inscuteable regulates spindle orientation and cell fate in the developing retina.Neuron. 2005; 48: 539-545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether mInsc controls the orientation of mitotic spindles in RGCs and, if so, whether the loss- and gain-of-function alleles influence spindle orientation and lineage specification in the developing brain. Various conflicting reports exist on the wild-type orientation of mitotic spindles in RGCs (Chenn and McConnell, 1995Chenn A. McConnell S.K.

Despite a strong genetic etiology, there are no current therapeutic options that target the core symptoms of ASD. Emerging evidence suggests that dysfunction of glutamatergic signaling, in particular through metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) receptors, may contribute to phenotypic deficits and may be appropriate targets for pharmacologic intervention. This study assessed the therapeutic potential of 2-methyl-6-phenylethyl-pyrididine (MPEP), an mGluR5-receptor antagonist, on repetitive and anxiety-like behaviors in the valproic acid (VPA) mouse model of autism. Mice were exposed prenatally on day E13 to VPA and assessed for repetitive self-grooming and marble burying behaviors as adults. Anxiety-like behavior and locomotor activity were measured in an open-field. VPA-exposed mice displayed increased repetitive and anxiety-like behaviors, consistent with previously published results. Across both marble burying and self-grooming assays, MPEP significantly reduced repetitive behaviors in VPA-treated mice, but had no effect on locomotor activity. These results are consistent with emerging preclinical literature that mGluR5-antagonists may have therapeutic efficacy for core symptoms of autism."

Here we delineate a role for this signaling pathway in obesity and its complications. Mice lacking PAR2 (F2rl1) or the cytoplasmic domain of tissue factor were protected from weight gain and insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. In hematopoietic cells, genetic ablation of tissue factor-PAR2 signaling reduced adipose tissue macrophage inflammation, and specific pharmacological inhibition of macrophage tissue factor signaling rapidly ameliorated insulin resistance. In contrast, nonhematopoietic cell tissue factor-VIIa-PAR2 signaling specifically promoted obesity. Mechanistically, adipocyte tissue factor cytoplasmic domain-dependent VIIa signaling suppressed Akt phosphorylation with concordant adverse transcriptional changes of key regulators of obesity and metabolism. Pharmacological blockade of adipocyte tissue factor in vivo reversed these effects of tissue factor-VIIa signaling and rapidly increased energy expenditure. Thus, inhibition of tissue factor signaling is a potential therapeutic avenue for improving impaired metabolism and insulin resistance in obesity."

The analgesic efficacy of the vasopressin analog desmopressin revealed a similar interaction between the drug and acute stress, as desmopressin inhibition of capsaicin pain was only observed in nonstressed subjects. Additional experiments in mice confirmed the male-specific interaction of V1AR and stress, leading to the conclusion that vasopressin activates endogenous analgesia mechanisms unless they have already been activated by stress.

The retina encodes luminance and contrast over a wide range of visual conditions and must adapt its responses to maintain sensitivity and to avoid saturation. We examined the means by which one type of adaptation allows individual synapses to compute contrast and encode luminance in biphasic responses to step changes in light levels. Light-evoked depletion of the readily releasable vesicle pool (RRP) at rod bipolar cell ribbon synapses in rat retina limited the dynamic range available to encode transient, but not sustained, responses, thereby allowing the transient and sustained components of release to compute temporal contrast and encode mean light levels, respectively. A release/replenishment model revealed that a single, homogeneous pool of synaptic vesicles is sufficient to generate this behavior and that a partial depletion of the RRP is the dominant mechanism for shaping the biphasic contrast/luminance response."
https://openalex.org/W2007405436,"An artificial microbial community consisted of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare and Bacillus megaterium has been used in industry to produce 2-keto-gulonic acid (2-KGA), the precursor of vitamin C. During the mix culture fermentation process, sporulation and cell lysis of B. megaterium can be observed. In order to investigate how these phenomena correlate with 2-KGA production, and to explore how two species interact with each other during the fermentation process, an integrated time-series proteomic and metabolomic analysis was applied to the system. The study quantitatively identified approximate 100 metabolites and 258 proteins. Principal Component Analysis of all the metabolites identified showed that glutamic acid, 5-oxo-proline, L-sorbose, 2-KGA, 2, 6-dipicolinic acid and tyrosine were potential biomarkers to distinguish the different time-series samples. Interestingly, most of these metabolites were closely correlated with the sporulation process of B. megaterium. Together with several sporulation-relevant proteins identified, the results pointed to the possibility that Bacillus sporulation process might be important part of the microbial interaction. After sporulation, cell lysis of B. megaterium was observed in the co-culture system. The proteomic results showed that proteins combating against intracellular reactive oxygen stress (ROS), and proteins involved in pentose phosphate pathway, L-sorbose pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acids metabolism were up-regulated when the cell lysis of B. megaterium occurred. The cell lysis might supply purine substrates needed for K. vulgare growth. These discoveries showed B. megaterium provided key elements necessary for K. vulgare to grow better and produce more 2-KGA. The study represents the first attempt to decipher 2-KGA-producing microbial communities using quantitative systems biology analysis."

In the multifaceted etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), CNVs appear to contribute significantly to our understanding of the pathogenesis of this complex disease. A unique resource of 42 extended ASD families was genotyped for over 1 million SNPs to detect CNVs that may contribute to ASD susceptibility. Each family has at least one avuncular or cousin pair with ASD. Families were then evaluated for co-segregation of CNVs in ASD patients. We identified a total of five deletions and seven duplications in eleven families that co-segregated with ASD. Two of the CNVs overlap with regions on 7p21.3 and 15q24.1 that have been previously reported in ASD individuals and two additional CNVs on 3p26.3 and 12q24.32 occur near regions associated with schizophrenia. These findings provide further evidence for the involvement of ICA1 and NXPH1 on 7p21.3 in ASD susceptibility and highlight novel ASD candidates, including CHL1, FGFBP3 and POUF41.

Unfortunately, many patients still relapse or suffer adverse events. We examined whether common germline polymorphisms in chemotherapeutic transporter and metabolic pathway genes of the drugs used in standard osteosarcoma treatment may predict treatment response.In this study we screened 102 osteosarcoma patients for 346 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2 Copy Number Variants (CNVs) in 24 genes involved in the metabolism or transport of cisplatin, adriamycin, methotrexate, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide. We studied the association of the genotypes with tumour response and overall survival. We found that four SNPs in two ATP-binding cassette genes were significantly associated with overall survival: rs4148416 in ABCC3 (per-allele HR = 8.14, 95%CI = 2.73-20.2, p-value = 5.1×10⁻⁵), and three SNPs in ABCB1, rs4148737 (per-allele HR = 3.66, 95%CI = 1.85-6.11, p-value = 6.9×10⁻⁵), rs1128503 and rs10276036 (r² = 1, per-allele HR = 0.24, 95%CI = 0.11-0.47 p-value = 7.9×10⁻⁵). Associations with these SNPs remained statistically significant after correction for multiple testing (all corrected p-values [permutation test] ≤ 0.03).Our findings suggest that these polymorphisms may affect osteosarcoma treatment efficacy. If these associations are independently validated, these variants could be used as genetic predictors of clinical outcome in the treatment of osteosarcoma, helping in the design of individualized therapy."

Alterations in this form of plasticity have been linked to drug addiction and cognitive disorders. A key characteristic of mGluR-LTD is its dependence on rapid protein synthesis; however, the identities of the proteins mediating LTD remain elusive. Here, we identify the X-linked mental retardation protein OPHN1 as a molecule essential for mGluR-LTD in the hippocampus. mGluR-LTD induction elicits rapid dendritic OPHN1 synthesis, which is dependent on mGluR1 activation and independent of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). This response is essential for mGluR-LTD, as acute blockade of OPHN1 synthesis impedes LTD. mGluR-induced OPHN1 mediates LTD and associated persistent decreases in surface AMPARs via interactions with endophilin A2/3. Importantly, this role of OPHN1 is separable from its effects on basal synaptic strength, which require OPHN1's Rho-GAP activity and interaction with Homer1b/c. Thus, our data establish a role for rapid OPHN1 synthesis in mGluR-LTD.Video Abstracthttps://www.cell.com/cms/asset/437666cf-fb5b-4e56-b080-4a0087024d08/mmc2.mp4Loading ...(mp4, 9.82 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W1985820712,"Embryogenesis is tightly regulated by multiple levels of epigenetic regulation such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling. DNA methylation patterns are erased in primordial germ cells and in the interval immediately following fertilization. Subsequent developmental reprogramming occurs by de novo methylation and demethylation. Variance in DNA methylation patterns between different cell types is not well understood. Here, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and tiling array technology, we have comprehensively analyzed DNA methylation patterns at proximal promoter regions in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, ES cell-derived early germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm) and four adult tissues (brain, liver, skeletal muscle and sperm). Most of the methylated regions are methylated across all three germ layers and in the three adult somatic tissues. This commonly methylated gene set is enriched in germ cell-associated genes that are generally transcriptionally inactive in somatic cells. We also compared DNA methylation patterns by global mapping of histone H3 lysine 4/27 trimethylation, and found that gain of DNA methylation correlates with loss of histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation. Our combined findings indicate that differentiation of ES cells into the three germ layers is accompanied by an increased number of commonly methylated DNA regions and that these tissue-specific alterations in methylation occur for only a small number of genes. DNA methylation at the proximal promoter regions of commonly methylated genes thus appears to be an irreversible mark which functions to fix somatic lineage by repressing the transcription of germ cell-specific genes."

Accumulating evidence indicates that neuronal voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels play an important role in memory processes and acquired neuronal channelopathies in HAD. To examine whether Kv channels are involved in HIV-1-associated neuronal injury, we studied the effects of HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 (gp120) on outward K+ currents in rat cortical neuronal cultures using whole-cell patch techniques. Exposure of cortical neurons to gp120 produced a dose-dependent enhancement of A-type transient outward K+ currents (IA). The gp120-induced increase of IA was attenuated by T140, a specific antagonist for chemokine receptor CXCR4, suggesting gp120 enhancement of neuronal IA via CXCR4. Pretreatment of neuronal cultures with a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, GF109203X, inhibited the gp120-induced increase of IA. Biological significance of gp120 enhancement of IA was demonstrated by experimental results showing that gp120-induced neuronal apoptosis, as detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and caspase-3 staining, was attenuated by either an IA blocker 4-aminopyridine or a specific CXCR4 antagonist T140. Taken together, these results suggest that gp120 may induce caspase-3 dependent neuronal apoptosis by enhancing IA via CXCR4-PKC signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2156352608,"While the study of phenotypic variation is a central theme in evolutionary biology, the genetic approaches available to understanding this variation are usually limited because of a lack of genomic information in non-model organisms. This study explored the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies for studying phenotypic variations between 2 populations of a non-model species, the Hokkai shrimp (Pandalus latirostris; Decapoda, Pandalidae). Before we performed transcriptome analyses using NGS, we examined the genetic and phenotypic differentiation between the populations. Analyses using microsatellite DNA markers suggested that these populations genetically differed from one another and that gene flow is restricted between them. Moreover, the results of our 4-year field observations indicated that the egg traits varied genetically between the populations. Using mRNA extracted from the ovaries of 5 females in each population of Hokkai shrimp, we then performed a transcriptome analysis of the 2 populations. A total of 13.66 gigabases (Gb) of 75-bp reads was obtained. Further, 58,804 and 33,548 contigs for the first and second population, respectively, and 47,467 contigs for both populations were produced by de novo assembly. We detected 552 sequences with the former approach and 702 sequences with the later one; both sets of sequences showed greater than twofold differences in the expression levels between the 2 populations. Twenty-nine sequences were found in both approaches and were considered to be differentially expressed genes. Among them, 9 sequences showed significant similarity to functional genes. The present study showed a de novo assembly approach for the transcriptome of a non-model species using only short-read sequence data, and provides a strategy for identifying sequences showing significantly different expression levels between populations."
https://openalex.org/W1972272210,"Death receptor-induced programmed necrosis is regarded as a secondary death mechanism dominating only in cells that cannot properly induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. Here, we show that in cells lacking TGFβ-activated Kinase-1 (TAK1) expression, catalytically active Receptor Interacting Protein 1 (RIP1)-dependent programmed necrosis overrides apoptotic processes following Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNFα) stimulation and results in rapid cell death. Importantly, the activation of the caspase cascade and caspase-8-mediated RIP1 cleavage in TNFα-stimulated TAK1 deficient cells is not sufficient to prevent RIP1-dependent necrosome formation and subsequent programmed necrosis. Our results demonstrate that TAK1 acts independently of its kinase activity to prevent the premature dissociation of ubiquitinated-RIP1 from TNFα-stimulated TNF-receptor I and also to inhibit the formation of TNFα-induced necrosome complex consisting of RIP1, RIP3, FADD, caspase-8 and cFLIPL. The surprising prevalence of catalytically active RIP1-dependent programmed necrosis over apoptosis despite ongoing caspase activity implicates a complex regulatory mechanism governing the decision between both cell death pathways following death receptor stimulation."

It has been reported as deregulated in diverse cancer types. Here, BAG1 protein was found highly expressed in children with acute myeloid leukemia at diagnosis, and in a cohort of leukemic cell lines. A silencing approach was used for determining BAG1's role in AML, finding that its down-regulation decreased expression of BCL2, BCL-XL, MCL1, and phospho-ERK1/2, all proteins able to sustain leukemia, without affecting the pro-apoptotic protein BAX. BAG1 down-regulation was also found to increase expression of BAG3, whose similar activity was able to compensate the loss of function of BAG1. BAG1/BAG3 co-silencing caused an enhanced cell predisposition to death in cell lines and also in primary AML cultures, affecting the same proteins. Cell death was CASPASE-3 dependent, was accompanied by PARP cleavage and documented by an increased release of pro-apoptotic molecules Smac/DIABLO and Cytochrome c. BAG1 was found to directly maintain BCL2 and to protect MCL1 from proteasomal degradation by controlling USP9X expression, which appeared to be its novel target. Finally, BAG1 was found able to affect leukemia cell fate by influencing the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins crucial for AML maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W1970044001,"Hypoxia inducible factor 1α (Hif1α) is a stress responsive transcription factor, which regulates the expression of genes required for adaption to hypoxia. Hif1α is normally hydroxylated by an oxygen-dependent prolylhydroxylase, leading to degradation and clearance of Hif1α from the cell. Under hypoxic conditions, the activity of the prolylhydroxylase is reduced and Hif1α accumulates. Hif1α is also constitutively expressed in tumor cells, where it is associated with resistance to ionizing radiation. Activation of the Hif1α transcriptional regulatory pathway may therefore function to protect normal cells from DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. Here, we utilized the prolylhydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) to elevate Hif1α levels in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to determine if DMOG could function as a radioprotector. The results demonstrate that DMOG increased Hif1α protein levels and decreased the sensitivity of MEFs to ionizing radiation. Further, the ability of DMOG to function as a radioprotector required Hif1α, indicating a key role for Hif1α's transcriptional activity. DMOG also induced the Hif1α -dependent accumulation of several DNA damage response proteins, including CHD4 and MTA3 (sub-units of the NuRD deacetylase complex) and the Suv39h1 histone H3 methyltransferase. Depletion of Suv39h1, but not CHD4 or MTA3, reduced the ability of DMOG to protect cells from radiation damage, implicating increased histone H3 methylation in the radioprotection of cells. Finally, treatment of mice with DMOG prior to total body irradiation resulted in significant radioprotection of the mice, demonstrating the utility of DMOG and related prolylhydroxylase inhibitors to protect whole organisms from ionizing radiation. Activation of Hif1α through prolylhydroxylase inhibition therefore identifies a new pathway for the development of novel radiation protectors."

https://openalex.org/W1975209939,"Neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) play an important role in the development and represent a valuable cell source for tissue engineering. However, how mechanical factors in vivo regulate NCSC differentiation is not understood. Here NCSCs were derived from induced pluripotent stem cells and used as a model to determine whether vascular mechanical strain modulates the differentiation of NCSCs into smooth muscle (SM) lineage. NCSCs were cultured on micropatterned membranes to mimic the organization of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and subjected to cyclic uniaxial strain. Mechanical strain enhanced NCSC proliferation and ERK2 phosphorylation. In addition, mechanical strain induced contractile marker calponin-1 within 2 days and slightly induced SM myosin within 5 days. On the other hand, mechanical strain suppressed the differentiation of NCSCs into Schwann cells. The induction of calponin-1 by mechanical strain was inhibited by neural induction medium but further enhanced by TGF-β. For NCSCs pre-treated with TGF-β, mechanical strain induced the gene expression of both calponin-1 and SM myosin. Our results demonstrated that mechanical strain regulates the differentiation of NCSCs in a manner dependent on biochemical factors and the differentiation stage of NCSCs. Understanding the mechanical regulation of NCSC differentiation will shed light on the development and remodeling of vascular tissues, and how transplanted NCSCs respond to mechanical factors."
https://openalex.org/W2093904255,"Both OTX2 and MYC are important oncogenes in medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in childhood. Much is known about MYC binding to promoter regions, but OTX2 binding is hardly investigated. We used ChIP-on-chip data to analyze the binding patterns of both transcription factors in D425 medulloblastoma cells. When combining the data for all promoter regions in the genome, OTX2 binding showed a remarkable bi-modal distribution pattern with peaks around −250 bp upstream and +650 bp downstream of the transcription start sites (TSSs). Indeed, 40.2% of all OTX2-bound TSSs had more than one significant OTX2-binding peak. This OTX2-binding pattern was very different from the TSS-centered single peak binding pattern observed for MYC and other known transcription factors. However, in individual promoter regions, OTX2 and MYC have a strong tendency to bind in proximity of each other. OTX2-binding sequences are depleted near TSSs in the genome, providing an explanation for the observed bi-modal distribution of OTX2 binding. This contrasts to the enrichment of E-box sequences at TSSs. Both OTX2 and MYC binding independently correlated with higher gene expression. Interestingly, genes of promoter regions with multiple OTX2 binding as well as MYC binding showed the highest expression levels in D425 cells and in primary medulloblastomas. Genes within this class of promoter regions were enriched for medulloblastoma and stem cell specific genes. Our data suggest an important functional interaction between OTX2 and MYC in regulating gene expression in medulloblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2164883952,"Dramatic advances in recent decades in understanding the genetics of Friedreich ataxia (FRDA)—a GAA triplet expansion causing greatly reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin—have thus far yielded no therapeutic dividend, since there remain no effective treatments that prevent or even slow the inevitable progressive disability in affected individuals. Clinical interventions that restore frataxin expression are attractive therapeutic approaches, as, in theory, it may be possible to re-establish normal function in frataxin deficient cells if frataxin levels are increased above a specific threshold. With this in mind several drugs and cytokines have been tested for their ability to increase frataxin levels. Cell transplantation strategies may provide an alternative approach to this therapeutic aim, and may also offer more widespread cellular protective roles in FRDA. Here we show a direct link between frataxin expression in fibroblasts derived from FRDA patients with both decreased expression of hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzymes and increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide-mediated toxicity. We demonstrate that normal human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) induce both an increase in frataxin gene and protein expression in FRDA fibroblasts via secretion of soluble factors. Finally, we show that exposure to factors produced by human MSCs increases resistance to hydrogen peroxide-mediated toxicity in FRDA fibroblasts through, at least in part, restoring the expression of the hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzymes catalase and glutathione peroxidase 1. These findings suggest, for the first time, that stem cells may increase frataxin levels in FRDA and transplantation of MSCs may offer an effective treatment for these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2005502876,"During development, dendrites arborize in a field several hundred folds of their soma size, a process regulated by intrinsic transcription program and cell adhesion molecule (CAM)-mediated interaction. However, underlying cellular machineries that govern distal higher-order dendrite extension remain largely unknown. Here, we show that Nak, a clathrin adaptor-associated kinase, promotes higher-order dendrite growth through endocytosis. In nak mutants, both the number and length of higher-order dendrites are reduced, which are phenocopied by disruptions of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Nak interacts genetically with components of the endocytic pathway, colocalizes with clathrin puncta, and is required for dendritic localization of clathrin puncta. More importantly, these Nak-containing clathrin structures preferentially localize to branching points and dendritic tips that are undergoing active growth. We present evidence that the Drosophila L1-CAM homolog Neuroglian is a relevant cargo of Nak-dependent internalization, suggesting that localized clathrin-mediated endocytosis of CAMs facilitates the extension of nearby higher-order dendrites.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI3OGY1ZWRlOTZkYTdhYzgzMmFmM2NhYWIyN2RiZjgwOSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MDQ5OTYyfQ.CcL3Z4lwvPj0phXA7QoIqS5HXHD3csYQ9dUxtJ3t4diTemzdz2AwXIprDJtt2Tn_cCOlzrfdAuYlXRi3OBe5NTrJELYPAlX9GEQXEqmi_M1ya3jgZpgEOMCCaFOzKziwUFCR8lLqjzEeewXTWDyxJtzhCjCnMpFraYf3Ei0qm68MFoJ92EdWzEM5WJD_oZsDl74s-Gnodb3HxLv1KA2BL8Umgy8FXAhOiQR6Zf32AbTXuqANwqrzxNUTwDtYLqqrX0r6rJe8xOes7qOpHvq27Qid15s5a-FUYfZfBiUs21Jo-ze0dhvvfod1HHpiETMFgCVn4mjjQuLA4wvBoGIZSA(mp4, (16.13 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2037527862,"We have showed that secretory Apolipoprotein J/Clusterin (sCLU) is down-regulated in senescent, stressed or diseased red blood cells (RBCs). It was hypothesized that sCLU loss relates to RBCs vesiculation, a mechanism that removes erythrocyte membrane patches containing defective or potentially harmful components.To investigate this issue we employed a combination of biochemical and microscopical approaches in freshly prepared RBCs or RBCs stored under standard blood bank conditions, an in vitro model system of cellular aging. We found that sCLU is effectively exocytosed in vivo during membrane vesiculation of freshly prepared RBCs. In support, the RBCs' sCLU content was progressively reduced during RBCs ex vivo maturation and senescence under cold storage due to its selective exocytosis in membrane vesicles. A range of typical vesicular components, also involved in RBCs senescence, like Band 3, CD59, hemoglobin and carbonylated membrane proteins were found to physically interact with sCLU.The maturation of RBCs is associated with a progressive loss of sCLU. We propose that sCLU is functionally involved in the disposal of oxidized/defected material through RBCs vesiculation. This process most probably takes place through sCLU interaction with RBCs membrane proteins that are implicit vesicular components. Therefore, sCLU represents a pro-survival factor acting for the postponement of the untimely clearance of RBCs."
https://openalex.org/W2120285800,"Vesicular transporters are required for the storage of all classical and amino acid neurotransmitters in synaptic vesicles. Some neurons lack known vesicular transporters, suggesting additional neurotransmitter systems remain unidentified. Insect mushroom bodies (MBs) are critical for several behaviors, including learning, but the neurotransmitters released by the intrinsic Kenyon cells (KCs) remain unknown. Likewise, KCs do not express a known vesicular transporter. We report the identification of a novel Drosophila gene portabella (prt) that is structurally similar to known vesicular transporters. Both larval and adult brains express PRT in the KCs of the MBs. Additional PRT cells project to the central complex and optic ganglia. prt mutation causes an olfactory learning deficit and an unusual defect in the male's position during copulation that is rescued by expression in KCs. Because prt is expressed in neurons that lack other known vesicular transporters or neurotransmitters, it may define a previously unknown neurotransmitter system responsible for sexual behavior and a component of olfactory learning."
https://openalex.org/W2169864100,"Background Alpha-lactalbumin (α-LA) is a calcium-bound mammary gland-specific protein that is found in milk. This protein is a modulator of β1,4-galactosyltransferase enzyme, changing its acceptor specificity from N-acetyl-glucosamine to glucose, to produce lactose, milk's main carbohydrate. When calcium is removed from α-LA, it adopts a molten globule form, and this form, interestingly, when complexed with oleic acid (OA) acquires tumoricidal activity. Such a complex made from human α-LA (hLA) is known as HAMLET (Human A-lactalbumin Made Lethal to Tumor cells), and its tumoricidal activity has been well established. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present work, we have used site-specific labeling, a technique previously developed in our laboratory, to label HAMLET with biotin, or a fluoroprobe for confocal microscopy studies. In addition to full length hLA, the α-domain of hLA (αD-hLA) alone is also included in the present study. We have engineered these proteins with a 17–amino acid C-terminal extension (hLA-ext and αD-hLA-ext). A single Thr residue in this extension is glycosylated with 2-acetonyl-galactose (C2-keto-galactose) using polypeptide-α-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase II (ppGalNAc-T2) and further conjugated with aminooxy-derivatives of fluoroprobe or biotin molecules. Conclusions/Significance We found that the molten globule form of hLA and αD-hLA proteins, with or without C-terminal extension, and with and without the conjugated fluoroprobe or biotin molecule, readily form a complex with OA and exhibits tumoricidal activity similar to HAMLET made with full-length hLA protein. The confocal microscopy studies with fluoroprobe-labeled samples show that these proteins are internalized into the cells and found even in the nucleus only when they are complexed with OA. The HAMLET conjugated with a single biotin molecule will be a useful tool to identify the cellular components that are involved with it in the tumoricidal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2078144805,"Background The renal medullary endothelin (ET-1) system plays an important role in the control of sodium excretion and arterial pressure (AP) through the activation of renal medullary ET-B receptors. We have previously shown that blockade of endothelin type B receptors (ET-B) leads to salt-sensitive hypertension through mechanisms that are not fully understood. One possible mechanism is through a reduction in renal medullary production of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE). 20-HETE, a metabolite of arachidonic acid, has natriuretic properties similar to ET-B activation. While these findings suggest a possible interaction between ET-B receptor activation and 20-HETE production, it is unknown whether blockade of medullary ET-B receptors in rats maintained on a high sodium intake leads to reductions in 20-HETE production. Methodology/Principal Findings The effect of increasing sodium intake from low (NS = .8%) to high (HS = 8%) on renal medullary production of 20-HETE in the presence and absence of renal medullary ET-B receptor antagonism was examined. Renal medullary blockade of ET-B receptors resulted in salt sensitive hypertension. In control rats, blood pressure rose from 112.8±2.4 mmHg (NS) to 120.7±9.3 mmHg (HS). In contrast, when treated with an ET-B receptor blocker, blood pressure was significantly elevated from 123.7±3.2 (NS) to 164.2±7.1 (HS). Furthermore, increasing sodium intake was associated with elevated medullary 20-HETE (5.6±.8 in NS vs. 14.3±3.7 pg/mg in HS), an effect that was completely abolished by renal medullary ET-B receptor blockade (4.9±.8 for NS and 4.5±.6 pg/mg for HS). Finally, the hypertensive response to intramedullary ET-B receptor blockade was blunted in rats pretreated with a specific 20-HETE synthesis inhibitor. Conclusion These data suggest that increases in renal medullary production of 20-HETE associated with elevating salt intake may be, in part, due to ET-B receptor activation within the renal medulla."
https://openalex.org/W2061351208,"Parasitic hookworms and the free-living model nematode Caenorhabtidis elegans share a developmental arrested stage, called the dauer stage in C. elegans and the infective third-stage larva (L3) in hookworms. One of the key transcription factors that regulate entrance to and exit from developmental arrest is the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16/FoxO. During the dauer stage, DAF-16 is activated and localized in the nucleus. DAF-16 is negatively regulated by phosphorylation by the upstream kinase AKT, which causes DAF-16 to localize out of the nucleus and the worm to exit from dauer. DAF-16 is conserved in hookworms, and hypothesized to control recovery from L3 arrest during infection. Lacking reverse genetic techniques for use in hookworms, we used C. elegans complementation assays to investigate the function of Ancylostoma caninum DAF-16 during entrance and exit from L3 developmental arrest. We performed dauer switching assays and observed the restoration of the dauer phenotype when Ac-DAF-16 was expressed in temperature-sensitive dauer defective C. elegans daf-2(e1370);daf-16(mu86) mutants. AKT phosphorylation site mutants of Ac-DAF-16 were also able to restore the dauer phenotype, but surprisingly allowed dauer exit when temperatures were lowered. We used fluorescence microscopy to localize DAF-16 during dauer and exit from dauer in C. elegans DAF-16 mutant worms expressing Ac-DAF-16, and found that Ac-DAF-16 exited the nucleus during dauer exit. Surprisingly, Ac-DAF-16 with mutated AKT phosphorylation sites also exited the nucleus during dauer exit. Our results suggest that another mechanism may be involved in the regulation DAF-16 nuclear localization during recovery from developmental arrest."
https://openalex.org/W2049508630,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the aggregation of α-synuclein into Lewy bodies. Existing therapies address motor dysfunction but do not halt progression of the disease. A still unresolved question is the biochemical pathway that modulates the outcome of protein misfolding and aggregation processes in PD. The molecular chaperone network plays an important defensive role against cellular protein misfolding and has been identified as protective in experimental models of protein misfolding diseases like PD. Molecular mechanisms underlying chaperone-neuroprotection are actively under investigation. Current evidence implicates a number of molecular chaperones in PD including Hsp25, Hsp70 and Hsp90, however their precise involvement in the neurodegenerative cascade is unresolved. The J protein family (DnaJ or Hsp40 protein family) has long been known to be important in protein conformational processes.We assessed sensory and motor function of control and PD rats and then evaluated the brain region-specific expression levels of select J proteins by Western analysis. Surprisingly, we observed a widespread 26 kDa breakdown product of the J protein, TID1, (tumorous imaginal discs, mtHsp40 or DnaJ3) in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD in which food handling, gait symmetry and sensory performance were impaired. Greater behavioral deficits were associated with lower TID1 expression. Furthermore, direct application of either 6-OHDA or MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinum) to CAD (CNS-derived catecholinaminergic neuronal cell line) cell cultures, reduced TID1 expression levels.Our results suggest that changes in cellular TID1 are a factor in the pathogenesis of PD by impeding functional and structural compensation and exaggerating neurodegenerative processes. In contrast, no changes were observed in CSPα, Hsp40, Hsp70, Hsc70 and PrP(C) levels and no activation of caspase3 was observed. This study links TID1 to PD and provides a new target for therapeutics that halts the PD progression."
https://openalex.org/W2043070197,"Tissue MicroArrays (TMAs) represent a potential high-throughput platform for the analysis and discovery of tissue biomarkers. As TMA slides are produced manually and subject to processing and sectioning artefacts, the layout of TMA cores on the final slide and subsequent digital scan (TMA digital slide) is often disturbed making it difficult to associate cores with their original position in the planned TMA map. Additionally, the individual cores can be greatly altered and contain numerous irregularities such as missing cores, grid rotation and stretching. These factors demand the development of a robust method for de-arraying TMAs which identifies each TMA core, and assigns them to their appropriate coordinates on the constructed TMA slide.This study presents a robust TMA de-arraying method consisting of three functional phases: TMA core segmentation, gridding and mapping. The segmentation of TMA cores uses a set of morphological operations to identify each TMA core. Gridding then utilises a Delaunay Triangulation based method to find the row and column indices of each TMA core. Finally, mapping correlates each TMA core from a high resolution TMA whole slide image with its name within a TMAMap.This study describes a genuine robust TMA de-arraying algorithm for the rapid identification of TMA cores from digital slides. The result of this de-arraying algorithm allows the easy partition of each TMA core for further processing. Based on a test group of 19 TMA slides (3129 cores), 99.84% of cores were segmented successfully, 99.81% of cores were gridded correctly and 99.96% of cores were mapped with their correct names via TMAMaps. The gridding of TMA cores were also extensively tested using a set of 113 pseudo slide (13,536 cores) with a variety of irregular grid layouts including missing cores, rotation and stretching. 100% of the cores were gridded correctly."

https://openalex.org/W2045220054,"Podocalyxin (Podxl) is a type I membrane sialoprotein of the CD34 family, originally described in the epithelial glomerular cells of the kidney (podocytes) in which it plays an important function. Podxl can also be found in megakaryocytes and platelets among other extrarenal places. The surface exposure of Podxl upon platelet activation suggested it could play some physiological role. To elucidate the function of Podxl in platelets, we generated mice with restricted ablation of the podxl gene in megakaryocytes using the Cre-LoxP gene targeting methodology. Mice with Podxl-null megakaryocytes did not show any apparent phenotypical change and their rates of growth, life span and fertility did not differ from the floxed controls. However, Podxl-null mice showed prolonged bleeding time and decreased platelet aggregation in response to physiological agonists. The number, size-distribution and polyploidy of Podxl-null megakaryocytes were similar to the floxed controls. Podxl-null platelets showed normal content of surface receptors and normal activation by agonists. However, the mice bearing Podxl-null platelets showed a significant retardation in the ferric chloride-induced occlusion of the carotid artery. Moreover, acute thrombosis induced by the i.v. injection of sublethal doses of collagen and phenylephrine produced a smaller fall in the number of circulating platelets in Podxl-null mice than in control mice. In addition, perfusion of uncoagulated blood from Podxl-null mice in parallel flow chamber showed reduced adhesion of platelets and formation of aggregates under high shear stress. It is concluded that platelet Podxl is involved in the control of hemostasis acting as a platelet co-stimulator, likely due to its pro-adhesive properties."
https://openalex.org/W2085116746,"Lower energy expenditure (EE) for physical activity was observed in Africans than in Europeans, which might contribute to the higher prevalence of obesity and more athletic capability in Africans. But it is still unclear why EE is lower among African populations. In this study we tried to explore the genetic mechanism underlying lower EE in Africans. We screened 231 common variants with possibly harmful impact on 182 genes in the catabolic process. The genetic risk, including the total number of mutations and the sum of harmful probabilities, was calculated and analyzed for the screened variants at a population level. Results of the genetic risk among human groups showed that most Africans (3 out of 4 groups) had a significantly smaller genetic risk in the catabolic process than Europeans and Asians, which might result in higher efficiency of generating energy among Africans. In sport competitions, athletes need massive amounts of energy expenditure in a short period of time, so higher efficiency of energy generation might help make African-descendent athletes more powerful. On the other hand, higher efficiency of generating energy might also result in consuming smaller volumes of body mass. As a result, Africans might be more vulnerable to obesity compared to the other races when under the same or similar conditions. Therefore, the smaller genetic risk in the catabolic process might be at the core of understanding lower EE, more athletic capability and higher prevalence of obesity in Africans."
