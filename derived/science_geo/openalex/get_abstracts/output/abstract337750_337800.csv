https://openalex.org/W2041581868,"A mycotoxin-producing strain of Fusarium moniliforme was isolated from southern leaf blight-damaged corn seed. A water-soluble toxin, subsequently purified from the fungus, had an oral median lethal dose of 4.0 milligrams per kilogram in 1-day-old cockerels. The toxin also produced plant growth-regulating and phytotoxic effects on plant systems. Physical and chemical data presented for the toxin suggest a structurally new toxin. The trivial name ""moniliformin"" has been assigned to the toxin."
https://openalex.org/W2115903920,"The discovery of impressions of 11 kinds of lepidopterous leaf mines, together with a reevaluation of previous reports, contributes significantly to the fossil record for that insect order. It is also concluded that some specific insect-plant associations have persisted from the Miocene to the present."
https://openalex.org/W1979343982,"An assemblage of cellularly well-preserved, filamentous and spheroidal plant microfossils has been detected in a cherty pisolite bed of the late Precambrian Chuar Group from the eastern Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. This newly discovered microflora, probably among the youngest Precambrian biological communities now known, appears to be of both evolutionary and biostratigraphic significance."

https://openalex.org/W2065225009,"Natural populations of Sulfolobus, a new genus of bacteria occurring in sulfur-rich, acid hot springs and soils, were found to oxidize large amounts of sulfur to sulfuric acid at temperatures up to 85 degrees C. These bacteria are important high-temperature geochemical agents in solfatara soils."
https://openalex.org/W1973133286,"Small solid precipitates (bubbles) of xenon in an aluminum matrix have been formed by ion implantation. Lattice images of this room-temperature inert gas solid were obtained using high-resolution phase-contrast electron microscopy. Many bubbles showed a high degree of crystalline perfection, but regions of defective crystallinity were observed in several cases."

https://openalex.org/W2070217528,"Halley's comet is the focus of an international scientific enterprise now under way. Ground-based astronomical observations are already yielding new information about the comet's nucleus and atmosphere. In the coming year, remote and in situ investigations from the ground, Earth orbit, Venus orbit, interplanetary space, and within the comet itself are expected to reveal much more. The climax of the enterprise will be the penetration of an armored European spacecraft into the center of the comet in March 1986."
