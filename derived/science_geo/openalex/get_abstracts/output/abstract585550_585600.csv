https://openalex.org/W2608764671,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is DNA shed by organisms into surrounding environments such as soil and water. The new methods using eDNA as a marker for species detection are being rapidly developed. Here we explore basic knowledge regarding the dependence of the eDNA degradation rate on time and water temperature, and the relationship between eDNA degradation and bacterial abundance. This subject has not been well clarified, even though it is essential for improving the reliability of eDNA analysis. To determine the time- and water temperature-dependent degradation of eDNA, river water was sampled and eDNA concentrations were determined for ayu sweetfish (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) at seven time points, over a 48-h period, and at three different water temperatures. The degradation of eDNA was modeled for each species using an existing exponential decay model with an extension to include water temperature effects. The degradation models were constructed for ayu sweetfish as Nt = 229,901.2 × exp [- (0.01062 × k - 0.07081) × t] and for common carp as Nt = 2,558.0 × exp [- (0.01075 × k - 0.07372) × t]. Nt is the DNA concentration at time t (elapsed time in hours) and k is the water temperature (°C). We also measured the concentration of eDNA derived from purified genomic DNA of the common carp, which was spiked into aquarium water without the target species, and we measured the bacterial abundance in the sample water after 12 and 24 h of incubation. Environmental DNA degradation was accelerated at higher water temperatures (generalized linear model, GLM; p < 0.001), but bacterial abundance did not have a significant effect on eDNA degradation (GLM, p = 0.097). These results suggest that the proper treatment of this temperature effect in data interpretations and adjustments would increase the reliability of eDNA analysis in future studies."

Sarcopenia is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as cardiovascular complications. Objectives To investigate the prevalence of sarcopenia in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis and its correlation with clinical and laboratory variables and inflammatory markers. Methods A total of 100 patients of both sexes aged over 18 were evaluated. Sarcopenia was defined using the criteria of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) and of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) Sarcopenia Project. Sociodemographic and clinical data, activities of daily living, functional capacity, and physical activity were also evaluated. Inflammation was assessed by the serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin (IL) 4 and 6. Results The prevalence of sarcopenia was 11.9% and 28.7% using the EWGSOP and FNIH criteria, respectively. Sarcopenia was more prevalent in the more advanced stages of CKD (34.5% in stages 2 and 3A; and 65.5% in stages 3B, 4, and 5) and associated with worse performance in activities of daily living (p = 0.049), lower walking speeds (p < 0.001), and higher body mass indexes (BMIs) (p = 0.001) in the non-adjusted model. In addition, patients with sarcopenia had lower functional capacity (p = 0.012) and higher prevalence of physical inactivity (p = 0.041) compared with patients without sarcopenia. After adjustment for confounding variables, sarcopenia was still significantly correlated with walking speed (p = 0.004) and BMI (p = 0.002). HsCRP levels were inversely correlated with appendicular lean mass adjusted for BMI (p = 0.007) and were also positively associated with BMI (p = 0.001). IL4 levels were positively correlated with walking speed (p = 0.007) and lean mass in the lower limbs (p = 0.022). Conclusions Sarcopenia is common in patients with CKD, particularly in the most advanced stages of the disease. We observed an association between the levels of inflammatory markers and peripheral lean body mass, physical performance, and BMI. This association between sarcopenia and modifiable factors highlights the importance of early diagnosis and the implementation of therapeutic measures to minimize adverse outcomes in patients with CKD not yet on dialysis."
https://openalex.org/W2609066508,"Aluminum (Al) is the third most abundant metal in earth crust, whose chemical form is mainly dependent on soil pH. The most toxic form of Al with respect to plants is Al3+, which exists in soil pH <5. Acidic soil significantly limits crop production mainly due to Al3+ toxicity worldwide, impacting approximately 50% of the world's arable land (in North-Eastern India 80% soil are acidic). Al3+ toxicity in plants ensues root growth inhibition leading to less nutrient and water uptake impacting crop productivity as a whole. Rice is one of the chief grains which constitutes the staple food of two-third of the world population including India and is not untouched by Al3+ toxicity. Al contamination is a critical constraint to plant production in agricultural soils of North East India. 24 indigenous Indica rice varieties (including Badshahbhog as tolerant check and Mashuri as sensitive check) were screened for Al stress tolerance in hydroponic plant growth system. Results show marked difference in growth parameters (relative growth rate, Root tolerance index, fresh and dry weight of root) of rice seedlings due to Al (100 μM) toxicity. Al3+ uptake and lipid peroxidation level also increased concomitantly under Al treatment. Histochemical assay were also performed to elucidate uptake of aluminum, loss of membrane integrity and lipid peroxidation, which were found to be more in sensitive genotypes at higher Al concentration. This study revealed that aluminum toxicity is a serious harmful problem for rice crop productivity in acid soil. Based on various parameters studied it's concluded that Disang is a comparatively tolerant variety whereas Joymati a sensitive variety. Western blot hybridization further strengthened the claim, as it demonstrated more accumulation of Glutathione reductase (GR) protein in Disang rice variety than Joymati under stressed condition. This study also observed that the emergence of lethal toxic symptoms occurs only after 48h irrespective of the dose used in the study."
https://openalex.org/W2608119663,"Most information on seagrass carbon burial derives from point measurements, which are sometimes scaled by meadow area to estimate carbon stocks; however, sediment organic carbon (Corg) concentrations may vary with distance from the meadow edge, resulting in spatial gradients that affect the accuracy of stock estimates. We mapped sediment Corg concentrations throughout a large (6 km2) restored seagrass meadow to determine whether Corg distribution patterns exist at different spatial scales. The meadow originated from ≤1-acre plots seeded between 2001 and 2004, so we expected Corg to vary spatially according to the known meadow age at sample sites and with proximity to the meadow edge. Applying spatial autoregressive models allowed us to control for spatial autocorrelation and quantify the relative effects of edge proximity and age on Corg concentrations. We found that edge proximity, not age, significantly predicted the meadow-scale Corg distribution. We also evaluated relationships between Corg and a variety of specific explanatory variables, including site relative exposure, shoot density, sediment grain size, and bathymetry. Factors known to affect carbon burial at the plot-scale, such as meadow age and shoot density, were not significant controls on the meadow-scale Corg distribution. Strong correlations between Corg, grain size, and edge proximity suggest that current attenuation increases fine-sediment deposition and, therefore, carbon burial with distance into the meadow. By mapping the sediment Corg pool, we provide the first accurate quantification of an enhanced carbon stock attributable to seagrass restoration. The top 12 cm of the bed contain 3660 t Corg, approximately 1200 t more Corg than an equal area of bare sediment. Most of that net increase is concentrated in a meadow area with low tidal current velocities. Managers should account for the effects of meadow configuration and current velocity when estimating seagrass blue carbon stocks. Our results suggest that a large, contiguous meadow should store more blue carbon than an equal area of small meadow patches."
https://openalex.org/W2609370437,"Sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) caused the highest number of human deaths between 2001 and 2015 and ranked second compared to other wild animals in causing human casualties in the Kanha-Pench corridor area. We studied the patterns of sloth bear attacks in the region to understand the reasons for conflict. We interviewed 166 victims of sloth bear attacks which occurred between 2004 and 2016 and found that most attacks occurred in forests (81%), with the greatest number of those (42%) occurring during the collection of Non-Timber Forest Produce (NTFP), 15% during the collection of fuelwood and 13% during grazing of livestock. The remainder took place at forest edges or in agricultural fields (19%), most occurring when person(s) were working in fields (7%), defecating (5%), or engaged in construction work (3%). Most victims were between the ages of 31 to 50 (57%) and most (54%) were members of the Gond tribe. The majority of attacks occurred in summer (40%) followed by monsoon (35%) and winter (25%). Forty-four percent of victims were rescued by people, while 43% of the time bears retreated by themselves. In 60% of attacks, a single bear was involved, whereas 25% involved adult females with dependent cubs and the remainder (15%) of the cases involved a pair of bears. We discuss the compensation program for attack victims as well as other governmental programs which can help reduce conflict. Finally, we recommend short-term mitigation measures for forest-dependent communities."
https://openalex.org/W2607553436,"Limited information is available describing the development of the neonatal fecal microbiome in dogs. Feces from puppies were collected at 2, 21, 42, and 56 days after birth. Feces were also collected from the puppies’ mothers at a single time point within 24 hours after parturition. DNA was extracted from fecal samples and 454-pyrosequencing was used to profile 16S rRNA genes. Species richness continued to increase significantly from 2 days of age until 42 days of age in puppies. Furthermore, microbial communities clustered separately from each other at 2, 21, and 42 days of age. The microbial communities belonging to dams clustered separately from that of puppies at any given time point. Major phylogenetic changes were noted at all taxonomic levels with the most profound changes being a shift from primarily Firmicutes in puppies at 2 days of age to a co-dominance of Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Firmicutes by 21 days of age. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between puppy microbiota development, physiological growth, neonatal survival, and morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2609118923,"Fire is a key Earth system process, with 80% of annual fire activity taking place in grassland areas. However, past fire regimes in grassland systems have been difficult to quantify due to challenges in interpreting the charcoal signal in depositional environments. To improve reconstructions of grassland fire regimes, it is essential to assess two key traits: (1) charcoal count, and (2) charcoal shape. In this study, we quantified the number of charcoal pieces in 51 sediment samples of ponds in the Great Plains and tested its relevance as a proxy for the fire regime by examining 13 potential factors influencing charcoal count, including various fire regime components (e.g. the fire frequency, the area burned, and the fire season), vegetation cover and pollen assemblages, and climate variables. We also quantified the width to length (W:L) ratio of charcoal particles, to assess its utility as a proxy of fuel types in grassland environments by direct comparison with vegetation cover and pollen assemblages. Our first conclusion is that charcoal particles produced by grassland fires are smaller than those produced by forest fires. Thus, a mesh size of 120μm as used in forested environments is too large for grassland ecosystems. We recommend counting all charcoal particles over 60μm in grasslands and mixed grass-forest environments to increase the number of samples with useful data. Second, a W:L ratio of 0.5 or smaller appears to be an indicator for fuel types, when vegetation surrounding the site is before composed of at least 40% grassland vegetation. Third, the area burned within 1060m of the depositional environments explained both the count and the area of charcoal particles. Therefore, changes in charcoal count or charcoal area through time indicate a change in area burned. The fire regimes of grassland systems, including both human and climatic influences on fire behavior, can be characterized by long-term charcoal records."
https://openalex.org/W2608107864,"Backgrounds Hypouricemia was reported as a risk factor for exercise-induced acute renal injury (EIAKI) and urinary stones. However, the prevalence of kidney diseases among hypouricemic subjects has not been evaluated. This study was conducted to clarify the prevalence of hypouricemia and the association of hypouricemia with kidney diseases by using a large-scale Japanese population data. Methods This study is a retrospective cross-sectional study at the Center for Preventive Medicine, St. Luke’s International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, and Sanin Rousai Hospital, Yonago, Japan. We analyzed the medical records of 90,143 Japanese subjects at the center in St. Luke’s International Hospital, Tokyo, and 4,837 subjects in Sanin Rousai Hospital, Yonago, who underwent annual regular health check-up between January 2004 and June 2010. We defined hypouricemia as serum uric acid level of ≤2.0 mg/dL. We checked the medical history of all the study subjects and compared the rates of complications including urinary stones and kidney diseases among those with or without hypouricemia. Results The prevalence of hypouricemia was 0.19% in St. Luke’s International Hospital, Tokyo, and 0.58% in Sanin Rousai Hospital, Yonago. The prevalence of hypouricemia in women was larger than that in men both in Tokyo (0.31% vs 0.068%, p<0.001) and in Yonago (1.237% vs 0.318%, p<0.001). Among 172 hypouricemic subjects (30 men), the rates of previous urinary stones and kidney diseases (including nephritis/nephrosis) were 1.2% (3.3% men, 0.7% women) and 2.3% (10% men, 0.7% women), respectively. Hypouricemic men had a 9-fold higher rate of previously having kidney diseases compared to non-hypouricemic men (p<0.001). However, the rates of other diseases including urinary stones were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusions Hypouricemia was associated with a history of kidney disease especially in men."
https://openalex.org/W2608558050,"Background Selenium and coenzyme Q10 is essential for important cellular functions. A low selenium intake is reported from many European countries, and the endogenous coenzyme Q10 production is decreasing in the body with increasing age. Supplementation with selenium and coenzyme Q10 in elderly have shown reduced cardiovascular mortality and reduced levels of markers of inflammation. However, microRNA analyses could give important information on the mechanisms behind the clinical effects of supplementation. Methods Out of the 443 healthy elderly participants that were given supplementation with 200 μg Se/day as organic selenium yeast tablets, and 200 mg/day of coenzyme Q10 capsules, or placebo for 4 years, 25 participants from each group were randomized and evaluated regarding levels of microRNA. Isolation of RNA from plasma samples and quantitative PCR analysis were performed. Volcano- and principal component analyses (PCA)–plots were used to illustrate the differences in microRNA expression between the intervention, and the placebo groups. Serum selenium concentrations were measured before intervention. Findings On average 145 different microRNAs out of 172 were detected per sample. In the PCA plots two clusters could be identified indicating significant difference in microRNA expression between the two groups. The pre-treatment expression of the microRNAs did not differ between active treatment and the placebo groups. When comparing the post-treatment microRNAs in the active and the placebo groups, 70 microRNAs exhibited significant differences in expression, also after adjustment for multiple measurements. For the 20 microRNAs with the greatest difference in expression the difference was up to more than 4 fold and with a P-value that were less than 4.4e-8. Conclusions Significant differences were found in expression of more than 100 different microRNAs with up to 4 fold differences as a result of the intervention of selenium and coenzyme Q10 combined. The changes in microRNA could be a part of mechanisms underlying the clinical effects earlier reported that reduced cardiovascular mortality, gave better cardiac function, and showed less signs of inflammation and oxdative stress following the intervention. However, more research is needed to understand biological mechanisms of the protective effects of selenium and Q10 supplementation."
https://openalex.org/W2608874938,"The purpose of this work was to use various molecular imaging techniques to non-invasively assess GSK2849330 (anti HER3 ADCC and CDC enhanced ‘AccretaMab’ monoclonal antibody) pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in human xenograft tumor-bearing mice. Immuno-PET biodistribution imaging of radiolabeled 89Zr-GSK2849330 was assessed in mice with HER3 negative (MIA-PaCa-2) and positive (CHL-1) human xenograft tumors. Dose dependency of GSK2849330 disposition was assessed using varying doses of unlabeled GSK2849330 co-injected with 89Zr-GSK2849330. In-vivo NIRF optical imaging and ex-vivo confocal microscopy were used to assess the biodistribution of GSK2849330 and the HER3 receptor occupancy in HER3 positive xenograft tumors (BxPC3, and CHL-1). Ferumoxytol (USPIO) contrast-enhanced MRI was used to investigate the effects of GSK2849330 on tumor macrophage content in CHL-1 xenograft bearing mice. Immuno-PET imaging was used to monitor the whole body drug biodistribution and CHL-1 xenograft tumor uptake up to 144 hours post injection of 89Zr-GSK2849330. Both hepatic and tumor uptake were dose dependent and saturable. The optical imaging data in the BxPC3 xenograft tumor confirmed the tumor dose response finding in the Immuno-PET study. Confocal microscopy showed a distinguished cytoplasmic punctate staining pattern within individual CHL-1 cells. GSK2849330 inhibited tumor growth and this was associated with a significant decrease in MRI signal to noise ratio after USPIO injection and with a significant increase in tumor macrophages as confirmed by a quantitative immunohistochemistry analysis. By providing both dose response and time course data from both 89Zr and fluorescently labeled GSK2849330, complementary imaging studies were used to characterize GSK2849330 biodistribution and tumor uptake in vivo. Ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI was used to monitor aspects of the immune system response to GSK2849330. Together these approaches potentially provide clinically translatable, non-invasive techniques to support dose optimization, and assess immune activation and anti-tumor responses."
https://openalex.org/W2610010097,"The gut microbiota is essentially a multifunctional bioreactor within a human being. The exploration of its enormous metabolic potential provides insights into the mechanisms underlying microbial ecology and interactions with the host. The data obtained using ""shotgun"" metagenomics capture information about the whole spectrum of microbial functions. However, each new study presenting new sequencing data tends to extract only a little of the information concerning the metabolic potential and often omits specific functions. A meta-analysis of the available data with an emphasis on biomedically relevant gene groups can unveil new global trends in the gut microbiota. As a step toward the reuse of metagenomic data, we developed a method for the quantitative profiling of user-defined groups of genes in human gut metagenomes. This method is based on the quick analysis of a gene coverage matrix obtained by pre-mapping the metagenomic reads to a global gut microbial catalogue. The method was applied to profile the abundance of several gene groups related to antibiotic resistance, phages, biosynthesis clusters and carbohydrate degradation in 784 metagenomes from healthy populations worldwide and patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and obesity. We discovered country-wise functional specifics in gut resistome and virome compositions. The most distinct features of the disease microbiota were found for Crohn's disease, followed by ulcerative colitis and obesity. Profiling of the genes belonging to crAssphage showed that its abundance varied across the world populations and was not associated with clinical status. We demonstrated temporal resilience of crAssphage and the influence of the sample preparation protocol on its detected abundance. Our approach offers a convenient method to add value to accumulated ""shotgun"" metagenomic data by helping researchers state and assess novel biological hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W2608551172,"Background Fine definition of targeted CD8+ T-cell epitopes and their human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I restriction informs iterative improvements of HIV-1 T-cell vaccine designs and may predict early vaccine success or failure. Here, lymphocytes from volunteers, who had received candidate HIVconsv vaccines expressing conserved sub-protein regions of HIV-1, were used to define the optimum-length target epitopes and their HLA restriction. In HIV-1-positive patients, CD8+ T-cell responses predominantly recognize immunodominant, but hypervariable and therefore less protective epitopes. The less variable, more protective epitopes in conserved regions are typically subdominant. Therefore, induction of strong responses to conserved regions by vaccination provides an opportunity to discover novel important epitopes. Methods Cryopreserved lymphocytes from vaccine recipients were expanded by stimulation with 15-mer responder peptides for 10 days to establish short term-cell-line (STCL) effector cells. These were subjected to intracellular cytokine staining using serially truncated peptides and peptide-pulsed 721.221 cells expressing individual HLA class I alleles to define minimal epitope length and HLA restriction by stimulation of IFN-γ and TNF-α production and surface expression of CD107a. Results Using lymphocyte samples of 12 vaccine recipients, we defined 14 previously unreported optimal CD8+ T-cell HIV-1 epitopes and their four-digit HLA allele restriction (6 HLA-A, 7 HLA-B and 1 HLA-C alleles). Further 13 novel targets with incomplete information were revealed. Conclusions The high rate of discovery of novel CD8+ T-cell effector epitopes warrants further epitope mining in recipients of the conserved-region vaccines in other populations and informs development of HIV-1/AIDS vaccines.

https://openalex.org/W2607517529,"Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of the bovine tuberculosis (bTB), mainly affects cattle, its natural reservoir, but also a wide range of domestic and wild mammals. Besides direct transmission via contaminated aerosols, indirect transmission of the M. bovis between wildlife and livestock might occur by inhalation or ingestion of environmental substrates contaminated through infected animal shedding. We monitored the survival of M. bovis in two soil samples chosen for their contrasted physical and-chemical properties (i.e. pH, clay content). The population of M. bovis spiked in sterile soils was enumerated by a culture-based method after 14, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 days of incubation at 4°C and 22°C. A qPCR based assay targeting the IS1561' locus was also performed to monitor M. bovis in both sterile and biotic spiked soils. The analysis of survival profiles using culture-based method showed that M. bovis survived longer at lower temperature (4°C versus 22°C) whereas the impact of soil characteristics on M. bovis persistence was not obvious. Furthermore, qPCR-based assay detected M. bovis for a longer period of time than the culture based method with higher gene copy numbers observed in sterile soils than in biotic ones. Impact of soil type on M. bovis persistence need to be deepened in order to fill the gap of knowledge concerning indirect transmission of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2608252367,"The breadth of diagnostic procedures that utilize cell free DNA (cfDNA) from human plasma has increased dramatically in recent years. Here, we confirm that tumor-derived cfDNA fragments are similar in size distribution to cfDNA derived from normal tissues. Therefore, collection procedures optimized with healthy donor specimens are likely to be applicable to the diagnosis and monitoring of many different cancer types. We verify that the distribution and DNA sequences of fragmentation sites in cfDNA from both normal-germline and tumor-derived cfDNA are non-random. A broad survey of cfDNA from healthy donors suggests that average individuals possess ~6 ng of cfDNA per mL of plasma. Importantly, the cfDNA present in plasma samples that were initially collected as whole blood in K2-EDTA tubes and subsequently processed by centrifugation is stable for several days at ambient temperatures. This observation has the potential to significantly reduce the cost and logistical complexity of shipping clinical samples from the site of collection to centers proficient in diagnostic analysis. Finally, plasma samples collected with high-volume plasma collection devices possess abundant quantities of cfDNA. Since the quantity of analyzed cfDNA is directly proportional to sensitivity of diagnostic assays, this method of plasma collection, where available, could enable highly sensitive post-treatment disease monitoring and early detection of cancer in at-risk individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2608278491,"We examined age-related biochemical and histological changes in the fat bodies and hemolymph of Osmia rufa males and females. We analysed solitary bees during diapause, in October and in April; as well as the flying insects following diapause, in May and June. The trophocyte sizes, as well as the numbers of lipid droplets were the greatest at the beginning of diapause. Subsequently, they decreased along with age. Triglyceride and glucose concentrations systematically decreased in fat body cells but increased in the hemolymph from October to June. Concentrations/activities of (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) antioxidant and proteolytic systems, as well as phenoloxidase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels were constant during the diapause, usually lower in the males than the females. Prior to the diapause/overwintering, the concentrations/activities of all the compounds were higher in the fat bodies than in the hemolymph. Later in the spring and in the summer, they increased in the hemolymph and on the body surfaces, while decreasing in the fat bodies. The global DNA methylation levels increased with age. Higher levels were always observed in the males than in the females. The study will promote better understanding of bee evolution and will be useful for the protection and management of solitary bees, with benefits to the environment and agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W2607689192,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that is showing increasing rates of carbapenem resistance. Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) International Clones (ICs), associated with certain oxacillinases, are being reported globally. This organism also harbors numerous virulence determinants. In this study, we aim at characterizing A. baumannii isolated from a Spanish hospital in terms of antimicrobial susceptibility, clonality, carbapenemase genes harbored, and virulence determinants expressed.Fifty nine clinical bloodstream isolates were obtained from 2009 until 2013. Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing was performed according to the CLSI guidelines. PFGE and tri-locus PCR typing were then performed in order to determine local and international clonality. PCRs for the detection of common carbapenemases were also performed. Production of hemolysis, biofilms, siderophores, surface motility, and proteolysis were determined phenotypically. Doubling times for selected strains were also calculated. Finally, statistical analysis for detecting associations between these factors was conducted.Carbapenem non-susceptibility was 84.75%, suggesting the immediate need for intervention. PFGE showed the distribution of the majority of the isolates among 7 clusters. Although all three ICs were detected, IC II was predominant at 71.19%. blaOXA-24-like was the most prevalent carbapenemase (62.71%), followed by blaOXA-58-like (13.56%), and blaOXA-23-like (11.86%). Strains pertaining to IC II, and those harboring blaOXA-24-like, were positively associated with α-hemolysis, production of strong biofilms, and siderophore production. Harboring blaOXA-23-like and blaOXA-58-like was associated with attenuated virulence. These associations suggest that an interplay exists between these factors that could be locally exploited.An alarmingly high rate of carbapenem non-susceptibility has been detected in this study. There was a predominance of IC II and blaOXA-24-like, and those factors were associated with heightened expression of virulence determinants. This association could be exploited for modifying treatment regimens and for improving on infection control protocols in this hospital."
https://openalex.org/W2607586247,"Two objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy post-2013 (CAP, 2014–2020) in the European Union (EU) are the sustainable management of natural resources and climate smart agriculture. To understand the CAP impact on these priorities, the Land Use/Cover statistical Area frame Survey (LUCAS) employs direct field observations and soil sub-sampling across the EU. While a huge amount of information can be retrieved from LUCAS points for monitoring the environmental status of agroecosystems and assessing soil carbon sequestration, a fundamental aspect relating to climate change action is missing, namely nitrous oxide (N2O) soil emissions. To fill this gap, we ran the DayCent biogeochemistry model for more than 11’000 LUCAS sampling points under agricultural use, assessing also the model uncertainty. The results showed that current annual N2O emissions followed a skewed distribution with a mean and median values of 2.27 and 1.71 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Using a Random Forest regression for upscaling the modelled results to the EU level, we estimated direct soil emissions of N2O in the range of 171–195 Tg yr-1 of CO2eq. Moreover, the direct regional upscaling using modelled N2O emissions in LUCAS points was on average 0.95 Mg yr-1 of CO2eq. per hectare, which was within the range of the meta-model upscaling (0.92–1.05 Mg ha-1 yr-1 of CO2eq). We concluded that, if information on management practices would be made available and model bias further reduced by N2O flux measurement at representative LUCAS points, the combination of the land use/soil survey with a well calibrated biogeochemistry model may become a reference tool to support agricultural, environmental and climate policies."
https://openalex.org/W2609277978,"The parasitic vines of the genus Cuscuta form haustoria that grow into other plants and connect with their vascular system, thus allowing the parasite to feed on its host. A major obstacle that meets the infection organ as it penetrates the host tissue is the rigid plant cell wall. In the present study, we examined the activity of xyloglucan endotransglucosylases/hydrolases (XTHs) during the host-invasive growth of the haustorium. The level of xyloglucan endotransglucosylation (XET) activity was found to peak at the penetrating stage of Cuscuta reflexa on its host Pelargonium zonale. In vivo colocalization of XET activity and donor substrate demonstrated XET activity at the border between host and parasite. A test for secretion of XET-active enzymes from haustoria of C. reflexa corroborated this and further indicated that the xyloglucan-modifying enzymes originated from the parasite. A known inhibitor of XET, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, was shown to reduce the level of XET in penetrating haustoria of C. reflexa. Moreover, the coating of P. zonale petioles with the inhibitor compound lowered the number of successful haustorial invasions of this otherwise compatible host plant. The presented data indicate that the activity of Cuscuta XTHs at the host-parasite interface is essential to penetration of host plant tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2607529963,"Guanylyl cyclase-C (GC-C) agonists increase cGMP levels in the intestinal epithelium to promote secretion. This process underlies the utility of exogenous GC-C agonists such as linaclotide for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C). Because GC-C agonists have limited use in pediatric patients, there is a need for alternative cGMP-elevating agents that are effective in the intestine. The present study aimed to determine whether the PDE-5 inhibitor sildenafil has similar effects as linaclotide on preclinical models of constipation. Oral administration of sildenafil caused increased cGMP levels in mouse intestinal epithelium demonstrating that blocking cGMP-breakdown is an alternative approach to increase cGMP in the gut. Both linaclotide and sildenafil reduced proliferation and increased differentiation in colon mucosa, indicating common target pathways. The homeostatic effects of cGMP required gut turnover since maximal effects were observed after 3 days of treatment. Neither linaclotide nor sildenafil treatment affected intestinal transit or water content of fecal pellets in healthy mice. To test the effectiveness of cGMP elevation in a functional motility disorder model, mice were treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to induce colitis and were allowed to recover for several weeks. The recovered animals exhibited slower transit, but increased fecal water content. An acute dose of sildenafil was able to normalize transit and fecal water content in the DSS-recovery animal model, and also in loperamide-induced constipation. The higher fecal water content in the recovered animals was due to a compromised epithelial barrier, which was normalized by sildenafil treatment. Taken together our results show that sildenafil can have similar effects as linaclotide on the intestine, and may have therapeutic benefit to patients with CIC, IBS-C, and post-infectious IBS."

With only two small studies published to date, evidence for an association between ABO blood type and ovarian cancer survival is limited.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Tumor Registry confirmed ovarian cancer cases from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center with blood type from linked laboratory reports and ABO variants from linked Illumina Exome BeadChip data. Associations with overall survival (OS) were quantified by hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) from proportional hazards regression models; covariates included age, race, stage, grade, histologic subtype, and year of diagnosis.ABO phenotype (N = 694) and/or genotype (N = 154) data were available for 713 predominantly Caucasian (89.3%) cases. In multivariable models, blood type A had significantly better OS compared to either O (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.60-0.93) or all non-A (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63-0.94) cases. Similarly, missense rs1053878 minor allele carriers (A2) had better OS (HR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.25-0.99). Among Caucasians, this phenotype association was strengthened, but the genotype association was attenuated; instead, four variants sharing moderate linkage disequilibrium with the O variant were associated with better OS (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.39-0.99) in unadjusted models.Blood type A was significantly associated with longer ovarian cancer survival in the largest such study to date. This finding was supported by genetic analysis, which implicated the A2 allele, although O related variants also had suggestive associations. Further research on ABO and ovarian cancer survival is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2608319605,"Phenotypic heterogeneity in microbial communities enables genetically identical organisms to behave differently even under the same environmental conditions. Photorhabdus luminescens, a bioluminescent Gram-negative bacterium, contains a complex life cycle, which involves a symbiotic interaction with nematodes as well as a pathogenic association with insect larvae. P. luminescens exists in two distinct phenotypic cell types, designated as the primary (1°) and secondary (2°) cells. The 1° cells are bioluminescent, pigmented and can support nematode growth and development. Individual 1° cells undergo phenotypic switching after prolonged cultivation and convert to 2° cells, which lack the 1° specific phenotypes. The LysR-type regulator HexA has been described as major regulator of this switching process. Here we show that HexA controls phenotypic heterogeneity in a versatile way, directly and indirectly. Expression of hexA is enhanced in 2° cells, and the corresponding regulator inhibits 1° specific traits in 2° cells. HexA does not directly affect bioluminescence, a predominant 1° specific phenotype. Since the respective luxCDABE operon is repressed at the post-transcriptional level and transcriptional levels of the RNA chaperone gene hfq are also enhanced in 2° cells, small regulatory RNAs are presumably involved that are under control of HexA. Another phenotypic trait that is specific for 1° cells is quorum sensing mediated cell clumping. The corresponding pcfABCDEF operon could be identified as the first direct target of HexA, since the regulator binds to the pcfA promoter region and thereby blocks expression of the target operon. In summary, our data show that HexA fulfills the task as repressor of 1° specific features in 2° cells in a versatile way and gives first insights into the complexity of regulating phenotypic heterogeneity in Photorhabdus bacteria."

There has been convincing research that these ""systems thinking"" skills can be learned. However, there is little research on methods for teaching these skills to children or assessing their impact. The Environmental Dashboard is a technology that uses ""sociotechnical"" feedback-information feedback designed to affect thought and behavior. Environmental Dashboard (ED) combines real-time information on community resource use with images and words that reflect pro-environmental actions of community members. Prior research indicates that ED supports the development of systems thinking in adults. To assess its impact on children, the technology was installed in a primary school and children were passively exposed to ED displays. This resulted in no measurable impact on systems thinking skills. The next stage of this research examined the impact of actively integrating ED into lessons on electricity in 4th and 5th grade. This active integration enhanced both content-related systems thinking skills and content retention."
https://openalex.org/W2608217035,"The therapeutic capacity of fenretinide (N-[4-hydroxyphenyl] retinamide; 4-HPR) has been demonstrated for several conditions, including cancer, obesity, diabetes, and ocular disease. Yet, the mechanisms of action for its pleiotropic effects are still undefined. We hypothesized that investigation of two of the major physiological metabolites of fenretinide, N-[4-methoxyphenyl]retinamide (MPR) and 4-oxo-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (3-keto-HPR), might begin to resolve the multifaceted effects of this synthetic retinoid. We analyzed the effects of fenretinide, MPR, 3-keto-HPR, and the non-retinoid RBP4 ligand A1120, on the activity of known targets of fenretinide, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and dihydroceramide Δ4-desaturase 1 (DES1) in ARPE-19 cells, and purified recombinant mouse beta-carotene oxygenase 1 (BCO1) in vitro. Lipids and retinoids were extracted and quantified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and reversed phase HPLC, respectively. The data demonstrate that while fenretinide is an inhibitor of the activities of these three enzymes, that 3-keto-HPR is a more potent inhibitor of all three enzymes, potentially mediating most of the in vivo beneficial effects of fenretinide. However, while MPR does not affect SCD1 and DES1 activity, it is a potent specific inhibitor of BCO1. We conclude that a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of action of fenretinide and its metabolites provides new avenues for therapeutic specificity. For example, administration of 3-keto-HPR instead of fenretinide may be preferential if inhibition of SCD1 or DES1 activity is the goal (cancer), while MPR may be better for BCO1 modulation (carotenoid metabolism). Continued investigation of fenretinide metabolites in the context of fenretinide’s various therapeutic uses will begin to resolve the pleotropic nature of this compound."

This study was to observe the effect of corticosteroids on keratocytes both in normal condition and inflammation status in vitro.Rat keratocytes were cultured and used for examination. 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to establish the inflammatory keratocyte cell model, and prednisolone acetate (PA), dexamethasone (Dex) and fluorometholone (Flu) were used as corticosteroids treatments. 5 d-growth curve and cell viabilities were assayed by CCK8, and cell morphologies and migration rate were studied. TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels were examined by ELISA. Western blotting was used to quantified type VI collagen (Col VI) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expressions, and immunofluorescence staining assays of Col I and Col VI were carried out.In normal condition, proliferation and migration of keratocytes were slightly influenced in PA, Dex and Flu groups. The secretion of Col I and Col VI was suppressed and MMP9 expression increased in corticosteroids groups. But no significant difference was seen in TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β expression levels. In inflammatory status, TNF-α, IL-6 and MMP9 levels increased in LPS group, while they significantly decreased in corticosteroids groups. Although keratocytes viabilities and migration were slightly affected in 24 h, no significant differences were seen between LPS group and corticosteroids groups in 5-d proliferation. Col I and Col VI secretion in LPS-keratocytes was maintained with corticosteroids treatments.Corticosteroids showed lightly effects on keratocytes proliferation and migration, but it successfully decreased TNF-α, IL-6 level and maintained the secretion of and Col I and Col VI, while suppressed the expression of MMP9 in LPS-induced keratocytes. PA was suggested to use in early stage of keratitis clinical treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2608782924,"In addition to the deleterious effect on health, there is considerable economic and psychosocial morbidity associated with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID). Also, the cost of a late diagnosis frequently results in a heavy disease burden on the patient. The objective of this study was to collect and analyze data on patients with PID in the state of Guanajuato in Mexico, to indirectly estimate the burden of the disease.An observational, longitudinal, and comparative study was conducted. A total of 44 patients were included and grouped according to the updated classification of PID.The median time elapsed from the onset of symptoms to the reference and diagnosis by a tertiary hospital was of 2.17 (IQR = 6.44) years. Before diagnosis, the number of hospitalizations/year per patient was 0.86 (IQR = 2.28), the number of visit to emergency room/year per patient was 0.92 (IQR = 1.77), the number of doctor's visits/year per patient was 15 (IQR = 11.25), whereas the school/work absence days per patient were reported in 52.72 (IQR = 56.35) days per year. After diagnosis, 20 patients (45.45%) received IVIG replacement therapy, and all of them presented a significant improvement (p <0.05) in all the mentioned variables. Characteristically, even when patients with PID received IVIG, there was still an important disease burden when comparing them against healthy controls. Complications secondary to PID were detected in 19 patients (43.18%). The reported overall mortality rate was 6.82% (n = 3).We were able to indirectly estimate an important disease burden in patients with PID; which is considered to be preventable, at least in part, with effective interventions like health planning, research, collaboration with primary care providers, and generation of policies and practices, in order to improve the quality of life and care of families with PID."
https://openalex.org/W2609477799,"Cell therapy repair strategies using adult mesenchymal stromal cells have shown promising evidence to prevent cardiac deterioration in rodents even in the absence of robust differentiation of the cells into cardiomyocytes. We tested whether increasing doses of porcine adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (pASCs) increase cardiac tissue perfusion in pigs post-myocardial infarction (MI) receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) and Beta-blockers similarly to patients. Female pigs were subjected to MI induction by sponge permanent occlusion of left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) generating approximately 10% of injured LV area with minimum hemodynamic impact. We assessed tissue perfusion by real time myocardial perfusion echocardiography (RTMPE) using commercial microbubbles before and following pASCs treatment. Four weeks after the occlusion of the left circumflex artery, we transplanted placebo or pASCs (1, 2 and 4x106 cells/Kg BW) into the myocardium. The highest dose of pASCs increased myocardial vessel number and blood flow in the border (56% and 3.7-fold, respectively) and in the remote area (54% and 3.9-fold, respectively) while the non-perfused scar area decreased (up to 38%). We also found an increase of immature collagen fibers, although the increase in total tissue collagen and types I and III was similar in all groups. Our results provide evidence that pASCs-induced stimulation of tissue perfusion and accumulation of immature collagen fibers attenuates adverse remodeling post-MI beyond the normal beneficial effects associated with ACE inhibition and beta-blockade."
https://openalex.org/W2609886042,"Retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTR-RTs) are widespread mobile elements in eukaryotic genomes. We obtained a total of 81 partial LTR-RT sequences from lentil corresponding to internal retrotransposon components and LTRs. Sequences were obtained by PCR from genomic DNA. Approximately 37% of the LTR-RT internal sequences presented premature stop codons, pointing out that these elements must be non-autonomous. LTR sequences were obtained using the iPBS technique which amplifies sequences between LTR-RTs. A total of 193 retrotransposon-derived genetic markers, mainly iPBS, were used to obtain a genetic linkage map from 94 F7 inbred recombinant lines derived from the cross between the cultivar Lupa and the wild ancestor L. culinaris subsp. orientalis. The genetic map included 136 markers located in eight linkage groups. Clusters of tightly linked retrotransposon-derived markers were detected in linkage groups LG1, LG2, and LG6, hence denoting a non-random genomic distribution. Phylogenetic analyses identified the LTR-RT families in which internal and LTR sequences are included. Ty3-gypsy elements were more frequent than Ty1-copia, mainly due to the high Ogre element frequency in lentil, as also occurs in other species of the tribe Vicieae. LTR and internal sequences were used to analyze in silico their distribution among the contigs of the lentil draft genome. Up to 8.8% of the lentil contigs evidenced the presence of at least one LTR-RT similar sequence. A statistical analysis suggested a non-random distribution of these elements within of the lentil genome. In most cases (between 97% and 72%, depending on the LTR-RT type) none of the internal sequences flanked by the LTR sequence pair was detected, suggesting that defective and non-autonomous LTR-RTs are very frequent in lentil. Results support that LTR-RTs are abundant and widespread throughout of the lentil genome and that they are a suitable source of genetic markers useful to carry out further genetic analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2609946048,"Background Poor control of body temperature is associated with mortality and major morbidity in preterm infants. We aimed to quantify its dynamics and complexity to evaluate whether indices from fluctuation analyses of temperature time series obtained within the first five days of life are associated with gestational age (GA) and body size at birth, and presence and severity of typical comorbidities of preterm birth. Methods We recorded 3h-time series of body temperature using a skin electrode in incubator-nursed preterm infants. We calculated mean and coefficient of variation of body temperature, scaling exponent alpha (Talpha) derived from detrended fluctuation analysis, and sample entropy (TSampEn) of temperature fluctuations. Data were analysed by multilevel multivariable linear regression. Results Data of satisfactory technical quality were obtained from 285/357 measurements (80%) in 73/90 infants (81%) with a mean (range) GA of 30.1 (24.0–34.0) weeks. We found a positive association of Talpha with increasing levels of respiratory support after adjusting for GA and birth weight z-score (p<0.001; R2 = 0.38). Conclusion Dynamics and complexity of body temperature in incubator-nursed preterm infants show considerable associations with GA and respiratory morbidity. Talpha may be a useful marker of autonomic maturity and severity of disease in preterm infants."
https://openalex.org/W2608189314,"The tendency to lie is a part of personality. But are personality traits the only factors that make some people lie more often than others? We propose that cognitive abilities have equal importance. People with higher cognitive abilities are better, and thus more effective liars. This might reinforce using lies to solve problems. Yet, there is no empirical research that shows this relationship in healthy adults. Here we present three studies in which the participants had free choice about their honesty. We related differences in cognitive abilities and personality to the odds of lying. Results show that personality and intelligence are both important. People low on agreeableness and intelligent extraverts are most likely to lie. This suggests that intelligence might mediate the relationship between personality traits and lying frequency. While personality traits set general behavioral tendencies, intelligence and environment set boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2609640874,"A novel feeding protocol for delivery of bio-active agents to Varroa mites was developed by providing mites with honey bee larva hemolymph supplemented with cultured insect cells and selected materials delivered on a fibrous cotton substrate. Mites were starved, fed on treated hemolymph to deliver selected agents and then returned to bee larvae. Transcript levels of two reference genes, actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), as well as for nine selected genes involved in reproductive processes showed that the starvation and feeding protocol periods did not pose a high level of stress to the mites as transcript levels remained comparable between phoretic mites and those completing the protocol. The feeding protocol was used to deliver molecules such as hormone analogs or plasmids. Mites fed with Tebufenozide, an ecdysone analog, had higher transcript levels of shade than untreated or solvent treated mites. In order to extend this feeding protocol, cultured insect cells were incorporated to a final ratio of 1 part cells and 2 parts hemolymph. Although supplementation with Bombyx mori Bm5 cells increased the amount of hemolymph consumed per mite, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of mites that fed and survived. On the other hand, Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells reduced significantly the percentage of mites that fed and survived as well as the amount of hemolymph consumed. The feeding protocol provides a dynamic platform with which to challenge the Varroa mite to establish efficacy of control agents for this devastating honey bee pest."
https://openalex.org/W2608538996,"Dysfunction of salivary glands leads to several oral health problems, including dental caries, mastication and swallowing dysfunctions and multiple oral infections. Conventional treatments for such condition fell short of providing satisfying therapeutic results. Recent advances in organ regeneration therapy which utilize tissue stem cells to fabricate bioengineered 3D organ buds, have introduced a promising therapeutic tool for full functional organ regeneration. However, finding a sustainable and easily accessible cell source for such approaches is still challenging, especially in case of severely atrophied tissues such as irradiated salivary glands. In response to this, we hypothesized that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could be used as feeder cells to induce salivary epithelial tissues/cells branching. Indeed, in 2D cultures, MSCs supported branching of embryonic submandibular salivary gland (SMG) epithelium. Interestingly, this enhancing effect was dependent on the initial number of MSC feeder cells. In addition, MSCs supported the self-assembly of SMG epithelial progenitor cells into well-patterned and branched 3D salivary organoids. Therefore, these findings propose MSCs as a valuable candidate cell source for induced SMG epithelial branching, which can potentially be applied in future methods for SMG regeneration approaches."

Small mammals were collected using Sherman live capture traps and transported to Korea University where they were euthanized, tissues removed, and assayed to determine hantavirus IgG antibody-positive and hantavirus-positive rates by RT-PCR. A total of 2,364 small mammals were captured over 11,300 trap nights (capture rate = 20.92%). Apodemus agrarius was the most commonly collected (76.65%), with capture rates of 9.62% and 21.70% for Cp Humphreys and the expansion site, respectively. Overall, Hantaan virus (HTNV) IgG antibody-positive (Ab+) rate for A. agrarius was 2.15% (39/1,812). A total of 5.43% (10/184) Crocidura lasiura, 0.79% (2/254) Microtus fortis and 2.44% (1/41) Micromys minutus were serologically IgG Ab+ for hantaviruses. HTNV-specific RT-PCR demonstrated that 28.2% (11/39) HTNV Ab+ A. agrarius harbored the 328-nt sequence of the GC glycoprotein-encoding M segment of HTNV. Among them, the whole genome sequences of 3 HTNV strains were obtained by conventional RT-PCR and Rapid Amplification cDNA Ends PCR. Phylogenetic analyses of the HTNV strains from Cp Humphreys and the expansion site, Pyeongtaek, show a greater diversity of rodent-borne hantaviruses compared to HTNV previously identified in Gyeonggi province of the ROK. Thus, this study provides significant insights for raising HFRS threat awareness, analysis, and risk reduction strategies in southern Gyeonggi province."

However, access to CD4+ T cell count in rural health facilities remains a major challenge in Ethiopia like other resource-limited settings.Both capillary and venous blood was drawn from each of 325 study participant recruited in Addis Ababa and surroundings. The CD4+ T-cell count, CD4%, and hemoglobin (Hgb) were tested at one of the four study health facilities using capillary blood and BD FACSPresto™ device. These tests were also done at the national HIV reference laboratory, using venous blood with BD FACSCalibur™, Sysmex XT-1800i™, and BD FACSPresto™.BD FACSPresto™ had an absolute mean bias of -13.3 cells/ul (-2.99%) and 28.3 cells/μl (6.4%) using venous and capillary blood, respectively, compared with BD FACSCalibur™. The absolute CD4 assay on the BD FACSPresto™ had a regression coefficient (R2) of 0.87 and 0.92 using capillary blood and venous blood samples, respectively, compared with BD FACSCalibur™. The percentage similarity of the BD FACSPresto™ using capillary and venous blood was 105.2% and 99.3%, respectively. The sensitivity of the FACSPresto™ using threshold of 500 cells/μl for ART eligibility using capillary and venous blood was 87.9 and 94.3%, while the specificity was 91.4 and 83.8%, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2607612816,"Background Age-related chronic diseases are prevalent in HIV-infected persons in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. Bone mineral density (BMD) loss and emphysema have separately been shown to occur at a younger age and with lesser risk exposure in HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected individuals. In non-HIV infected smokers, emphysema has been shown to independently predict low BMD. We hypothesized that emphysema would independently associate with thoracic vertebral bone attenuation, a surrogate for bone mineral density, in HIV-infected individuals. Methods Clinical, pulmonary function, and radiographic data were analyzed for 164 individuals from the University of Pittsburgh’s HIV Lung Research Center cohort. Chest CT scans were used to quantify emphysema and compute Hounsfield Unit (HU) attenuation of the 4th, 7th, and 10th thoracic vertebrae. The association between mean HU attenuation values across the three vertebrae and radiographic emphysema, age, sex, body mass index (BMI), steroid use, viral load, CD4 count, and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) was assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results In univariate analysis, mean HU attenuation decreased with increasing age (p<0.001), pack years (p = 0.047), and percent emphysema (p<0.001). In a multivariable model, including pack years, age, sex, ART and steroid use, greater emphysema was independently associated with this surrogate marker of BMD in HIV-infected individuals (p = 0.034). Conclusions The association of emphysema with thoracic bone attenuation in HIV-infected individuals is consistent with previous reports in non-HIV infected smokers. These findings suggest that emphysema should be considered a potential marker of osteoporosis risk in HIV-infected individuals."

To further inform effective public health policy, an understanding of ZIKV's transmission mechanisms is crucial. To characterize the intercontinental transmission of ZIKV, we compiled and analyzed more than 250 gene sequences together with their sequence-related geographic and temporal information, sampled across 27 countries spanning from 1947 to 2016. After filtering and selecting appropriate sequences, extensive phylogenetic analyses were performed. Although phylogeographic reconstruction supported the transmission route of the virus in Africa, South-eastern Asia, Oceania and Latin America, we discovered that the Eastern Africa origin of ZIKV was disputable. On a molecular level, purifying selection was found to be largely responsible for the evolution of non-structural protein 5 and envelope protein E. Our dataset and ancestral sequences reconstruction analysis captured previously unidentified amino acid changes during evolution. Finally, based on the estimation of the time to the most recent common ancestors for the non-structural protein 5 gene, we hypothesized potential specific historic events that occurred in the 1940s and might have facilitated the spread of Zika virus from Africa to South-eastern Asia. Our findings provide new insights into the transmission characteristics of ZIKV, while further genetic and serologic studies are warranted to support the design of tailored prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2608486678,"Mucin-type O-glycosylation is a ubiquitous posttranslational modification in which N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) is added to the hydroxyl group of select serine or threonine residues of a protein by the family of UDP-GalNAc:Polypeptide N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (GalNAc-Ts; EC 2.4.1.41). Previous studies demonstrate that O-glycosylation plays essential roles in protein function, cell-cell interactions, cell polarity and differentiation in developing mouse and Drosophila embryos. Although this type of protein modification is highly conserved among higher eukaryotes, little is known about this family of enzymes in echinoderms, basal deuterostome relatives of the chordates. To investigate the potential role of GalNAc-Ts in echinoderms, we have begun the characterization of this enzyme family in the purple sea urchin, S. purpuratus. We have fully or partially cloned a total of 13 genes (SpGalnts) encoding putative sea urchin SpGalNAc-Ts, and have confirmed enzymatic activity of five recombinant proteins. Amino acid alignments revealed high sequence similarity among sea urchin and mammalian glycosyltransferases, suggesting the presence of putative orthologues. Structural models underscored these similarities and helped reconcile some of the substrate preferences observed. Temporal and spatial expression of SpGalnt transcripts, was studied by whole-mount in situ hybridization. We found that many of these genes are transcribed early in developing embryos, often with restricted expression to the endomesodermal region. Multicolor fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) demonstrated that transcripts encoding SpGalnt7-2 co-localized with both Endo16 (a gene expressed in the endoderm), and Gcm (a gene expressed in secondary mesenchyme cells) at the early blastula stage, 20 hours post fertilization (hpf). At late blastula stage (28 hpf), SpGalnt7-2 message co-expresses with Gcm, suggesting that it may play a role in secondary mesenchyme development. We also discovered that morpholino-mediated knockdown of SpGalnt13 transcripts, results in a deficiency of embryonic skeleton and neurons, suggesting that mucin-type O-glycans play essential roles during embryonic development in S. purpuratus."

Few vaccines are currently available that could provide effective cross-protection against various serovars of H. parasuis. In this study, five OMPs (OppA, TolC, HxuC, LppC, and HAPS_0926) identified by bioinformatic approaches, were cloned and expressed as recombinant proteins. Antigenicity of the purified proteins was verified through Western blotting, and primary screening for protective potential was evaluated in vivo. Recombinant TolC (rTolC), rLppC, and rHAPS_0926 proteins showing marked protection of mice against H. parasuis infection, and were further evaluated individually or in combination. Mice treated with these three OMPs produced humoral and host cell-mediated responses, with a significant rise in antigen-specific IgG titer and lymphoproliferative response in contrast with the mock-immunized group. Significant increases were noted in CD4+, CD8+ T cells, and three cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-γ) in vaccinated animals. The antisera against candidate antigens could efficiently impede bacterial survival in whole blood bactericidal assay against H. parasuis infection. The multi-protein vaccine induced more pronounced immune responses and offered better protection than individual vaccines. Our findings indicate that these three OMPs are promising antigens for the development of multi-component subunit vaccines against Glässer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2607825020,"In two studies, we investigated the memory underpinnings of future intentions related to past hedonic experiences. Preceding research did not make clear whether the specific memory processes supporting the expression of intentions about the future involve global judgments of the past experience (general affective evaluations formed on-line) or judgments derived from the episodic recollection of the past. Adapting a correlational paradigm previously employed to study future intentions, and applying it to the experience of watching a movie, we comparatively tested the influence of global retrospective evaluations vs. episodic-derived evaluations on future intentions. In Study 1, in which the intentions involved a future experience that was very similar to an overall past one (e.g., seeing the movie sequel), the findings showed that participants relied only on global judgments to form future intentions. In Study 2, in which the global judgment on the past was less diagnostic because the future intentions referred to specific parts of the past experience (e.g., watching a movie centered on a minor character in the previously seen movie), the results indicated that relevant episodic memories provided an essential contribution to the prediction of future intentions. These findings are in agreement with the predictions of the accessibility-diagnosticity framework and they show that global judgments and episodic memories of a past experience contribute differentially to diverse kinds of future intentions."

However, most TJ proteins are four-time transmembrane proteins and are difficult to express in their correct soluble form, which limits their functional study and therapeutic application. Human occludin (OCLN) is a major component of TJs and an essential co-receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) cell entry. To explore expression strategy for recombinant TJ proteins possessing integrated and functional extracellular loops, OCLN was here used as a model molecule, and several prokaryotic fusion constructs were designed by docking OCLN extracellular loops (ECLs) to HIV-1 gp41 NHR and CHR six-helical bundle (6HV1); then their biophysical features and anti-HCV activity were evaluated. The proteins were successfully expressed and purified in E. coli, and the double-loop constructs (D1ECL1S+D2ECL2 as a representative) were found to have more potent HCV neutralizing activity than single-loop constructs at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Circular dichroism studies indicate that D1ECL1S+D2ECL2 adopt stable α-helical folds consistent with design. Thermal denaturation assay indicated that D1ECL1S+D2ECL2 is highly stable at 80°C (melting temperature, Tm, of 89.08 ± 2.0°C) and comparable in stability to the 6HV1 scaffold. Moreover, the time-of-addition experiment revealed that D1ECL1S+D2ECL2 predominantly functioned during the early stages of HCV entry. Taken together, these findings provide a novel strategy for recombinant TJ protein expression in vitro, which may shed light on functional and structural studies for TJs and may provide a new avenue to drug development."

First, porosity is defined as a function of water depth. A new governing equation for vegetation flow is established on the basis of the poroelastic media flow theory, and its analytical solution is obtained with the finite analytic method. Then, the fitting expression of permeability is established with experimental data, which shows the variation in permeability with vertical porosity and vegetation density. Finally, the calculated velocity distribution is compared with the measured velocity distribution. The theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental data, which indicates that the theoretical formula accurately and practically predicts vertical velocity distribution in complex open-channel flow with submerged vegetation."

Thus, it is possible to perform systems biology studies on the effects of PIDs on T-cell physiology and response. To achieve this, we reconstructed a T-cell network model based on literature mining and TPPIN, a previously published core T-cell network, and performed semi-quantitative dynamic network simulations on both normal and T-cell PID failure modes. The results for several loss-of-function PID simulations correspond to results of previously reported molecular studies. The simulations for TCR PTPRC, LCK, ZAP70 and ITK indicate profound changes to numerous proteins in the network. Significant effects were observed also in the BCL10, CARD11, MALT1, NEMO, IKKB and MAP3K14 simulations. No major effects were observed for PIDs that are caused by constitutively active proteins. The T-cell model facilitates the understanding of the underlying dynamics of PID disease processes. The approach confirms previous knowledge about T-cell signaling network and indicates several new important proteins that may be of interest when developing novel diagnosis and therapies to treat immunological defects."
https://openalex.org/W2609690483,"Previous findings suggest a link between neuroinflammatory processes and suicidality. Despite several lines of evidence supporting this link, including increased pro-inflammatory markers in blood-, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)- and in post-mortem brain samples from suicidal individuals, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this pilot study, we explored the possibility that autoimmune encephalopathies might be found among suicide attempters. We analysed the presence of six different autoantibodies (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazol-propionic acid receptor, the γ-amino-butyric acid B-receptor, the leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1, the contactin-associated protein-like 2, and the dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein-6), all previously associated with psychopathology, in CSF samples from 29 unmedicated suicide attempters. Five of these subjects had high CSF/serum albumin ratio, indicative of increased blood-brain-barrier permeability. We were not able to detect any of these autoantibodies in the CSF samples. These pilot data do not support a role for autoimmune encephalopathies in suicidal behaviour, although the presence of lower levels of these autoantibodies cannot be ruled out in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2609226102,"Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in Austria. However, no systematic information exists regarding characteristics and treatments of contemporary patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) in Austria. We assembled two retrospective physicians' databases to describe demographics, clinical profiles, and therapeutic strategies in patients with stable CAD. In addition, we compared patient profiles of secondary care internists and hospital-based cardiologists with those of general practitioners in a primary care setting outside of hospital.The study population was identified from retrospective chart review of 1020 patients from 106 primary care physicians in Austria (ProCor II registry), and was merged with a previous similar database of 1280 patients under secondary care (ProCor I registry) to yield a total patient number of 2300.Female patients with stable CAD were older, had more angina and/or heart failure symptoms, and more depression than males. Female gender, type 2 diabetes mellitus, higher CCS class and asthma/COPD were predictors of elevated heart rate, while previous coronary events/revascularization predicted a lower heart rate in multivariate analysis. There were no significant differences with regard to characteristics and management of patients of general practitioners in the primary care setting versus internists in secondary care.Characteristics and treatments of unselected patients with stable ischemic heart disease in Austria resemble the pattern of large international registries of stable ischemic heart disease, with the exception that diabetes and systemic hypertension were more prevalent."
https://openalex.org/W2609615725,"Objectives Vasopressors are not recommended by current trauma guidelines, but recent reports indicate that they are commonly used. We aimed to describe the early hemodynamic management of trauma patients outside densely populated urban centers. Methods We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study in a Canadian regional trauma center. All adult patients treated for traumatic injury in 2013 who died within 24 hours of admission or were transferred to the intensive care unit were included. A systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, a mean arterial pressure <60 mmHg, the use of vasopressors or ≥2 L of intravenous fluids defined hemodynamic instability. Main outcome measures were use of intravenous fluids and vasopressors prior to surgical or endovascular management. Results Of 111 eligible patients, 63 met our criteria for hemodynamic instability. Of these, 60 (95%) had sustained blunt injury and 22 (35%) had concomitant severe traumatic brain injury. The subgroup of patients referred from a primary or secondary hospital (20 of 63, 32%) had significantly longer transport times (243 vs. 61 min, p<0.01). Vasopressors, used in 26 patients (41%), were independently associated with severe traumatic brain injury (odds ratio 10.2, 95% CI 2.7–38.5). Conclusions In this cohort, most trauma patients had suffered multiple blunt injuries. Patients were likely to receive vasopressors during the early phase of trauma care, particularly if they exhibited signs of neurologic injury. While these results may be context-specific, determining the risk-benefit trade-offs of fluid resuscitation, vasopressors and permissive hypotension in specific patients subgroups constitutes a priority for trauma research going forwards."
https://openalex.org/W2609940777,"Microvascular dysfunction could be responsible for chest pain in patients without myocardial perfusion defects. We evaluated microvascular function using ultrasound-assessed coronary flow reserve (CFR) in patients with chest pain and normal myocardial perfusion scintigram. Secondly, we investigated association between cardiovascular parameters and decreased CFR in a sex specific manner.A total of 202 (128 women) non-diabetic patients with chest pain and suspected myocardial ischemia, but without myocardial perfusion defects on myocardial perfusion scintigram, were enrolled and underwent CFR examination and blood sampling. All patients were followed-up for cardiovascular events. We used a supervised principal component analysis including 66 variables such as clinical parameters, ongoing medication, coronary artery disease history, lipids, metabolic parameters, inflammatory and other cardiovascular parameters.During a median follow-up time of 5.4 years, 25 cardiovascular events occurred; (men;18, women;7). Average CFR of the study cohort was 2.7±1.2 and 14% showed impaired CFR<2.0. In an adjusted Cox regression analysis, CFR<2.0 independently predicted event-free survival (HR:2.5, p = 0.033). In the supervised principal component analysis high insulin resistance assessed by Homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance was the strongest biochemical marker associated with decreased CFR. Interestingly, upon sex specific multivariable linear regression analysis, the association was only significant in men (β = -0.132, p = 0.041) while systolic blood pressure remained an independent predictor in women (β = -0.009, p = 0.011).In non-diabetic patients with chest pain without myocardial perfusion defects, low CFR has prognostic value for future cardiovascular events. Insulin resistance appears to be a marker for decreased CFR in men. Indeed, in the context of contribution of traditional risk factors in this patient population, the value of systolic blood pressure seems to be important in the women."
https://openalex.org/W2607706978,"Workload consolidation is a common method to increase resource utilization of the clusters or data centers while still trying to ensure the performance of the workloads. In order to get the maximum benefit from workload consolidation, the task scheduler has to understand the runtime characteristics of the individual program and schedule the programs with less resource conflict onto the same server. We propose a set of metrics to comprehensively depict the runtime characteristics of programs. The metrics set consists of two types of metrics: resource usage and resource sensitivity. The resource sensitivity refers to the performance degradation caused by insufficient resources. The resource usage of a program is easy to get by common performance analysis tools, but the resource sensitivity can not be obtained directly. The simplest and the most intuitive way to obtain the resource sensitivity of a program is to run the program in an environment with controllable resources and record the performance achieved under all possible resource conditions. However, such a process is very much time consuming when multiple resources are involved and each resource is controlled in fine granularity. In order to obtain the resource sensitivity of a program quickly, we propose a method to speed up the resource sensitivity profiling process. Our method is realized based on two level profiling acceleration strategies. First, taking advantage of the resource usage information, we set up the maximum resource usage of the program as the upper bound of the controlled resource. In this way, the range of controlling resource levels can be narrowed, and the number of experiments can be significantly reduced. Secondly, using a prediction model achieved by interpolation, we can reduce the time spent on profiling even further because the resource sensitivity in most of the resource conditions is obtained by interpolation instead of real program execution. These two profiling acceleration strategies have been implemented and applied in profiling program runtime characteristics. Our experiment results show that the proposed two-level profiling acceleration strategy not only shortens the process of profiling, but also guarantees the accuracy of the resource sensitivity. With the fast profiling method, the average absolute error of the resource sensitivity can be controlled within 0.05."
https://openalex.org/W2609625905,"Low-volume polyethylene glycol (PEG) bowel preparations are better tolerated by patients than high-volume preparations and may achieve similar preparation quality. However, there is little data comparing their effects on a recommendation for an early repeat colonoscopy (because of a suboptimal preparation), procedure times, adenoma detection rate (ADR), and advanced adenoma detection rate (AADR).This is a retrospective cohort study of outpatient colonoscopies performed during a one-year period at a single academic medical center in which low-volume MoviPrep® (n = 1841) or high-volume Colyte® (n = 1337) was used. All preparations were split-dosed. Appropriate covariates were included in regression models assessing suboptimal preparation quality (fair, poor, or inadequate), procedure times, recommendation for an early repeat colonoscopy, ADR, and AADR.MoviPrep® was associated with an increase in having a suboptimal bowel preparation (OR 1.36; 95% CI: 1.06-1.76), but it was not associated with differences in insertion (p = 0.43), withdrawal (p = 0.22), or total procedure times (p = 0.10). The adjusted percentage with a suboptimal preparation was 11.7% for patients using MoviPrep® and 8.8% for patients using Colyte®. MoviPrep® was not associated with a significant difference in overall ADR (OR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.78-1.11), AADR (OR 1.18; 95% CI: 0.87-1.62), or recommendation for early repeat colonoscopy (OR 1.16; 95% CI: 0.72-1.88).MoviPrep® was associated with a small absolute increase in having a suboptimal preparation, but did not affect recommendations for an early repeat colonoscopy, procedure times, or adenoma detection rates. Mechanisms to reduce financial barriers limiting low-volume preparations should be considered because of their favorable tolerability profile."
https://openalex.org/W2608633980,"When simulating fluids, such as water or fire, interacting with solids, it is a challenging problem to represent details of diffusion front in physical reaction. Previous approaches commonly use isotropic or anisotropic diffusion to model the transport of a quantity through a medium or long interface. We have identified unrealistic monotonous patterns with previous approaches and therefore, propose to extend these approaches by integrating the deformation of the material with the diffusion process. Specifically, stretching deformation represented by strain is incorporated in a divergence-constrained diffusion model. A novel diffusion model is introduced to increase the global rate at which the solid acquires relevant quantities, such as heat or saturation. This ensures that the equations describing fluid flow are linked to the change of solid geometry, and also satisfy the divergence-free condition. Experiments show that our method produces convincing results."
