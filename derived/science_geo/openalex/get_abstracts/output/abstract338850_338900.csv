https://openalex.org/W1970664646,"Stick-slip often accompanies frictional sliding in laboratory experi ments with geologic materials. Shallow focus earthquakes may represent stick slip during sliding along old or newly formed faults in the earth In such a situation, observed stress drops repre sent release of a small fraction of the stress supported by the rock surround ing the earthquake focus."

Ten radiocarbon dates show ages that range from 11,560 to 14,800 and 16,250 to 20,000 years, and to more than 40,000 years. Absence of most mesophytic montane species in deposits as high as 1200 meters indicates a lack of equivalent downward dis placement for the ponderosa pine zone or other zones of montane vegetation. Uneven stocking of isolated peaks in the Chihuahuan Desert province with montane species suggests that long-distance transport of propagules, rather than former continuity, may account for the disjunct distributions of many species."
https://openalex.org/W1990457555,"THE RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM theory of fields was born some 35 years ago through the paternal efforts of Dirac, Heisenberg, Pauli and others. It was a somewhat retarded youngster, however, and first reached adolescence 17 years later, an event which we are gathered here to celebrate. But it is the subsequent development and more mature phase of the subject that I wish to discuss briefly today."

Living marine plankton organisms are used to demonstrate one practical application of this technique."
https://openalex.org/W2018597099,"Recrystallized planktonic limestones from two guyots in the North Atlantic are in oxygen-isotopic equilibrium with their present ambient waters, suggesting submarine lithifica tion and recrystallization. The early stages of submarine lithification of carbonates may involve precipitation of, and replacement by, magnesium-rich calcite; with time this may invert to magnesium-poor calcite. This type of lithification probably requires very low rates of sediment accumulation."

Most of this material is finer than a centimeter and probably finer than a few millimeters, although objects of centimeter size and larger are plentiful."

https://openalex.org/W2079560433,"Profiles of repetitive seismnic reflections reveal that the Bering con tinental slope, outer shelf, and rise overlay an acoustically reflective ""basement"" which extends at least 750 kilometers parallel to the trend of the slope. This acoustic basement is usually covered by several hundred meters of stratified sediments at the top and bottom of the slope; however, it is exposed in sub marine canyons and flanking spurs along the main part of the slope for a distance of at least 550 kilometers northwest of the Pribilof Islands. The lithologic composition and the age of the rocks of the acoustic basement are not known. However, its probable seismic velocity of 3.1 to 3.7 kilometers per second suggests that it is composed of volcanic rocks or lithified sedimentary rocks or both. The regional geology suggests that the acoustic basement is the upper surface of folded late Mesozoic rocks which were locally intruded by granite and serpentine. The structure of the Bering slope, as deduced from the acoustic profiles, suggests that the surface of the basement has been monoclinically flexed and faulted between the shelf edge and the deep Aleutian Basin."

Maximum rotation at the in tracranial joint is approximately 15 de grees.

https://openalex.org/W1995099099,"Measurements of excess Ar36 + Ar38 (released mainly at 1200°C) in magnetic concentrates of Pacific sediments and in a dense concentrate of Greenland dust agree within an order of magnitude with expected concentrations implanted by solar-flare ion streams of energy less than 10 Mev per atomic-mass unit. The agreement implies that more than 10 percent of each concentrate may be extraterrestrial, depending on size distribution and flare spectra. Rare-gas measurements on fine-grained dust can provide data on: solar-flare ""paleo-ion"" fluxes, energy spectra, and isotopic abundances; identification, mineralogy, and chemistry of interplanetary dust; influx rates to Earth and sedimentation rates of oceanic cores; and lunar-surface residence and mixing times."
https://openalex.org/W2052362939,"The Butler iron meteorite has been found to have, with respect to other iron meteorites, an unusually high cobalt content (1.4 percent by weight), unusually high germanium contents in the kamacite and the taenite phases, and an unusually low cooling rate (0.5°C/106 years). It is suggested that Butler formed in a different environment from that of the rest of the iron meteorites."
https://openalex.org/W2123628149,"The Butler iron meteorite has been found to have a germanium concentration of 2000 parts per million, which is about five times higher than the highest concentration that has been measured previously in an iron meteorite. The gallium concentration is 87 parts per million, which is among the highest concentrations found in these objects. The nickel content is 16.0 percent, the second highest nickel concentration known in a meteorite displaying a Widman stätten pattern. The high Ge/Ni ratio, as well as the association of a high nickel content with high gallium and germanium contents, make this object an exception to two geochemical generalizations regarding the iron meteorites."
https://openalex.org/W2005112819,"The year 1954 marked the 50th anniversary of the Prandtl boundary-layer theory from which we may date the beginning of man's understanding of the dynamics of real fluids. A backward look at this aspect of the history of the last 50 years may be instructive. This paper (1) attempts to compress the events of those 50 years into a few thousand words, to tell in this brief space the interesting story of the development of a new concept, its slow acceptance and growth, its spread from group to group within its country of origin, and its diffusion to other countries of the world. The original brief paper of Prandtl (2) was presented at the Third International Mathematical Congress at Heidelberg in 1904 and published in the following year. It was an attempt to explain the d'Alembert paradox, namely, that the neglect of the small friction of air in the theory resulted in the prediction of zero resistance to motion. Prandtl set himself the task of computing the motion of a fluid of small friction, so small that its effect could be neglected everywhere except where large velocity differences were present or a cumulative effect of friction occurred This led to the concept of boundary layer, or transition layer, near the wall of a body immersed in a fluid stream in which the velocity rises from zero to the free-stream value. It is interesting that Prandtl used the term Grenzsehicht (boundary layer) only once and the term Ubergangsschicht (transition layer) seven times in the brief article. Later writers also used Reibungsschicht (friction layer), but most writers today use Grenzschicht (boundary layer)."

https://openalex.org/W2092646869,"The Stokes parameters were measured as a function of frequency for the anonmalous 1665-megacycles-per-second OH emission originating near the thermal radio source W3. The emission is highly polarized, and the polarization parameters vary rapidly with frequency. The observed polarization can be described in terms of narrow, roughly Gaussian, emission features, all with uniform polarization but with several features overlapping without coherence near the center of the spectrum. Most of the individual features may be 100-percent polarized. Detailed examination of the brightest features suggest that they are not exactly Gaussian in shape."

https://openalex.org/W2087521806,"The sex organs of the male are more resistant to dietary deficiencies, the animals showing only retrogression along with a significant loss in weight. Testosterone and gonadotropic hormone (of pregnant mare serum) produce a small but definite restorative effect. Oral administration of estrin to females depresses the food intake, while testosterone, and less so the gonadotropic hormone in males produces the opposite effect. This effect can be regarded as evidence of the dietary significance of these two hormones. The expenses of the present investigation were defrayed by the U. S. Vitamin Corporation, of New York City."
