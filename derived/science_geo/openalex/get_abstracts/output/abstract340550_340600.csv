https://openalex.org/W1982651456,"Mean July temperatures across Europe 6000 years before present were reconstructed from palynological data by the transfer function method. Reconstructed summer temperatures were warmer than those at present over most of Europe with the greatest heating, more than 2 degrees C, in the midcontinent and the far north. This pattern is explained by high summer insolation and a weak zonal insolation gradient 6000 years before present and the effective heating of the landmass relative to ocean and coastal areas. A strong land-sea pressure gradient may in turn have increased westerly air flow into southern Europe, which is consistent with cooler reconstructed summer temperatures in the Mediterranean region, and reduced the environmental lapse rate in the central European mountains."

Direct-write approaches are enabling faster, cheaper manufacture of electronic components and are also used for tissue engineering and array-based biosensors. In his Perspective, Chrisey provides a short overview of current research in the area of direct-write technologies, focusing on the materials science aspects."
https://openalex.org/W2029834806,"The most prominent oscillatory feature observed in the Voyager 1 radio occultation of Saturn's rings is identified as a one-armed spiral bending wave excited by Titan's -1:0 nodal inner vertical resonance. Ring particles in a bending wave move in coherently inclined orbits, warping the local mean plane of the rings. The Titan -1:0 wave is the only known bending wave that propagates outward, away from Saturn, and the only spiral wave yet observed in which the wave pattern rotates opposite to the orbital direction of the ring particles. It is also the first bending wave identified in ring C. Modeling the observed feature with existing bending wave theory gives a surface mass density of ∼0.4 g/cm2 outside the wave region and a local ring thickness of ≲5 meters, and suggests that surface mass density is not constant in the wave region."

In this month's essay, Daniel Kleppner and Roman Jackiw recount how quantum theory, which they rate as ""the most precisely tested and most successful theory in the history of science,"" came to be, how it changed the world, and how it might continue to evolve to make the dream of ultimate understanding of the universe come true."

Diatomic molecules often do not undergo productive chemistry, however, because the energy needed to break the diatomic bond is also high. In his Perspective, Thorp discusses the work by MacBeth et al., who have synthesized a nonheme iron complex that reacts with O2 to produce two equivalents of a metal-oxo complex. The complex elegantly mimic the ability of some enzymes to influence metal ion coordination spheres."

https://openalex.org/W2093730540,"THE subject of the present address is one that does not often appear on a scientific program. Physicists are so busy in enlarging the structure of knowledge that few of them concern themselves with the consideration of the fundamental concepts of the science. Yet it is plainly true that if those fundamental or primary concepts are not clearly apprehended, or if there is doubt as to what they are, the whole structure of the science rests on an insecure basis. I propose to examine certain questions concerning these primary concepts, about which there has been and is much unsettled opinion. The discussion necessarily rests upon my own beliefs about them. In the nature of the case each man can speak positively about them for himself, only. It would be very improper to dogmatize, and I shall accordingly have to crave your pardon for a frequent expression of my own opinion, believing it less objectionable to be egotistic than to be dogmatic."

The competition indicated that the technology still has a way to go."

https://openalex.org/W2038996461,"On 11 May, a criminal court in Vienna found one of Austria's most prominent political scientists, Anton Pelinka, guilty of defaming former Freedom Party leader Jörg Haider. Haider, an outspoken populist who has made questionable comments about Nazism, accused Pelinka of defaming him for asserting in an interview on Italian television in May 1999 that some Haider statements had ""trivialized"" Nazism. In the 3 months since the judgment, an array of academic and human rights groups have rushed to Pelinka's defense."
