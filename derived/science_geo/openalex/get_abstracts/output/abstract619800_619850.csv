Bisphenol A (BPA) is an environmental endocrine disruptor and has been shown to be positively associated with increased risk of preeclampsia in human studies. We investigated whether BPA exposure causes preeclampsia-like features in pregnant mice and the associated underlying mechanisms. Experiments were performed in animal models and cell cultures. In pregnant mice, BPA-exposed mice exhibited preeclampsia-like features including hypertension, disruption of the circulation, and the placental angiogenesis biomarkers fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 and placenta growth factor, and glomerular atrophy; urinary protein was not affected. These preeclampsia-like features correlated with increased retention of smooth muscle cells and reduced vessel areas at the junctional zone of the placenta. In addition, there were disrupted expression of invasion-related genes including increased tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, decreased metalloproteinases, and Wnt family member WNT2/β-catenin, which correlated with increased DNA methylation in its promoter region and upregulation of DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt)1. BPA exposure impeded the interaction between the human cytotrophoblast cell line, HTR-8/SVneo, and endothelium cells. BPA exposure down-regulated WNT2 expression, and elevated the DNA methylation of WNT2; these results were consistent with in vivo observations. Inhibition of DNMT in HTR-8/SVneo cells resulted in reduced DNA methylation and increased expression of WNT2. Taken together, these data demonstrate that BPA exposure alters trophoblast cell invasion and causes abnormal placental vessel remodeling, both of which lead to the development of preeclampsia-like features in pregnant mice. Our results suggest that this phenomenon involves the epigenetic reprogramming and down-regulation of WNT2 mediated by DNMT1.-Ye, Y., Tang, Y., Xiong, Y., Feng, L., Li, X. Bisphenol A exposure alters placentation and causes preeclampsia-like features in pregnant mice involved in reprogramming of DNA methylation of WNT2."
https://openalex.org/W2897010318,"The glycoside hydrolases encoded by the human gut microbiome play an integral role in processing a variety of exogenous and endogenous glycoconjugates. Here we present three structurally and functionally distinct β-glucuronidase (GUS) glycoside hydrolases from a single human gut commensal microbe, Bacteroides uniformis. We show using nine crystal structures, biochemical, and biophysical data that whereas these three proteins share similar overall folds, they exhibit different structural features that create three structurally and functionally unique enzyme active sites. Notably, quaternary structure plays an important role in creating distinct active site features that are hard to predict via structural modeling methods. The enzymes display differential processing capabilities toward glucuronic acid–containing polysaccharides and SN-38-glucuronide, a metabolite of the cancer drug irinotecan. We also demonstrate that GUS-specific and nonselective inhibitors exhibit varying potencies toward each enzyme. Together, these data highlight the diversity of GUS enzymes within a single Bacteroides gut commensal and advance our understanding of how structural details impact the specific roles microbial enzymes play in processing drug-glucuronide and glycan substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2896736088,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications and mortality, suggesting that treatment of NASH might benefit from combined approaches that target the liver and the cardiovascular components of NASH. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that G protein–coupled bile acid–activated receptor 1 (GPBAR1) agonism reverses liver and vascular damage in mouse models of NASH. NASH is associated with accelerated vascular inflammation representing an independent risk factor for development of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular-related mortality. GPBAR1, also known as TGR5, is a G protein–coupled receptor for secondary bile acids that reduces inflammation and promotes energy expenditure. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we investigated whether GPBAR1 agonism by 6β-ethyl-3α,7β-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-ol (BAR501) reverses liver and vascular damage induced by exposure to a diet enriched in fat and fructose (HFD-F). Treating HFD-F mice with BAR501 reversed liver injury and promoted the browning of white adipose tissue in a Gpbar1-dependent manner. Feeding HFD-F resulted in vascular damage, as shown by the increased aorta intima-media thickness and increased expression of inflammatory genes (IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS, and F4/80) and adhesion molecules (VCAM, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and endothelial selectin) in the aorta, while reducing the expression of genes involved in NO and hydrogen sulfide generation, severely altering vasomotor activities of aortic rings in an ex vivo assay. BAR501 reversed this pattern in a Gpbar1-dependent manner, highlighting a potential role for GPBAR1 agonism in treating the liver and vascular component of NASH.—Carino, A., Marchianò, S., Biagioli, M., Bucci, M., Vellecco, V., Brancaleone, V., Fiorucci, C., Zampella, A., Monti, M.

https://openalex.org/W2896393935,"The dietary R-3-hydroxybutyrate- R-1,3-butanediol monoester increases resting energy expenditure (REE) and markers of brown and white adipose thermogenesis in lean mice. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the ketone ester, R, S-1,3-butanediol diacetoacetate (BD-AcAc2), increases energy expenditure and markers of adipose tissue thermogenesis in the context of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Thirty-five-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were placed on an ad libitum HFD (45% kcal) for 10 wk. The mice were then randomized to 1 of 3 groups ( n = 10 per group) for an additional 12 wk: 1) control (Con), continuous HFD, 2) pair-fed (PF) to ketone ester (KE); and 3) KE: HFD+30% energy from BD-AcAc2. Mean energy intake throughout the study was ∼26% lower in the KE compared to the Con group (8.2 ± 0.5 vs. 11.2 ± 0.7 kcal/d; P < 0.05). Final body weight (26.8 ± 3.6 vs. 34.9 ± 4.8 g; P < 0.001) and fat mass (5.2 ± 1.2 vs. 11.3 ± 4.5 g; P < 0.001) of the KE group was significantly lower than PF, despite being matched for energy provisions. Differences in body weight and adiposity were accompanied by higher REE and total energy expenditure in the KE group compared to PF after adjustment for lean body mass and fat-mass ( P = 0.001 and 0.007, respectively). Coupled or uncoupled mitochondrial respiratory rates in skeletal muscle were not different among groups, but markers of mitochondrial uncoupling and thermogenesis (uncoupling protein-1, deiodinase-2, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α) were higher in interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) of mice receiving the KE diet. The absence of mitochondrial uncoupling in skeletal muscle and increased markers of mitochondrial uncoupling in BAT suggest that BD-AcAc2 initiates a transcriptional signature consistent with BAT thermogenesis in the context of HFD-induced obesity.-Davis, R. A. H., Deemer, S. E., Bergeron, J. M., Little, J. T., Warren, J. L., Fisher, G., Smith, D. L., Jr., Fontaine, K. R., Dickinson, S. L., Allison, D. B., Plaisance, E. P.

https://openalex.org/W2895959278,"Objective To evaluate the prognostic effects of combining serum circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) levels on patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy. Methods Ninety-nine patients with locally advanced cervical cancer ([FIGO] stage IIB-IVA) undergoing radiotherapy (RT) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) were identified. The association between serum CTC level and clinicopathological parameters was examined. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed by using Cox’s proportional hazards regression model. Results Elevated CTC and SCC-Ag levels were significantly associated with poor disease-free survival (DFS). Multivariate analysis suggest that serum CTC level, FIGO stage and serum SCC-Ag level were independent prognostic factors for two-year DFS. When CTC and SCC-Ag levels were combined into a new risk model to predict disease progression of cervical cancer patients, it performed a significantly better predictive efficiency compared with either biomarker alone. Conclusion Serum CTC and SCC-Ag levels are potentially useful biomarkers for prediction of prognosis in locally advanced cervical cancer patients and their combination significantly improves predictive ability for survival in locally advanced cervical cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2897874541,"Research suggests that partisans are increasingly avoiding members of the other party-in their choice of neighborhood, social network, even their spouse. Leveraging a national database of voter registration records, we analyze 18 million households in the U.S. We find that three in ten married couples have mismatched party affiliations. We observe the relationship between inter-party marriage and gender, age, and geography. We discuss how the findings bear on key questions of political behavior in the US. Then, we test whether mixed-partisan couples participate less actively in politics. We find that voter turnout is correlated with the party of one's spouse. A partisan who is married to a co-partisan is more likely to vote. This phenomenon is especially pronounced for partisans in closed primaries, elections in which non-partisan registered spouses are ineligible to participate."
https://openalex.org/W2896335122,"Background Four decades of conflict has indelibly impacted the lives of Afghans, exposing many to different forms of trauma. The aim of this paper investigate a hypothesis that (mostly war related) trauma is a key driver of partner violence in Afghanistan. Methods 1,463 women aged 18–48 were recruited into a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a women empowerment intervention in 8 villages of Kabul and Nangarhar provinces. The women were interviewed at baseline. The analysis uses multivariable logistic regression and structural equation modelling (SEM) to describe relationships between measures. Results 57.4% of women reported exposure to one of four types of trauma: 23.3% an armed attack, 39.4% had felt close to death, 10.6% witnessed a friend or family member being killed and 21.4% witnessed the death of a stranger or someone unknown. Trauma exposure was associated with being older, Pashtan, madrassa educated, and food insecure. Women who were trauma exposed were more likely to have ever experienced IPV, have hit their children in the last 4 weeks, and be hit by a sibling or relative of their husband or their mother-in-law in the last year. They held less patriarchal personal gender attitudes and perceived the community to be more patriarchal. The SEM showed that all pathways between trauma exposure and IPV were ultimately mediated by either (mostly mental) ill-health or quarrelling, but not both of these. There were multiple paths through which trauma exposure impacted women’s past year experience of physical IPV. One was mediated by childhood trauma exposure and a latent variable for ill health. Other paths were mediated by women’s education and personal gender attitudes and ill-health, or else by quarrelling. Trauma exposure was related to lower educational levels. Another path was mediated by less patriarchal personal gender attitudes and ill health. Community gender attitudes was a mediating variable on a path which was also mediated by ill health and another mediated by quarrelling. It was also a mediator on a path which included personal gender attitudes and ill-health. Food insecurity mediated another path with ill health. It was also connected to childhood trauma, community gender attitudes and educational level. Conclusion Trauma exposure due to conflict will persist until the conflict ends but the impact on women can be ameliorated. This analysis suggests interventions to reduce women’s exposure to IPV should focus on reducing poverty, changing social norms on gender, providing relationship skills to help reduce quarrelling and supporting women’s mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2897282631,"To ensure reproductive success, Canis species establish contiguous mosaics of territories in suitable habitats to partition space and defend limiting resources. Consequently, Canis species can exert strong effects on prey populations locally because of their year-round maintenance of territories. We assessed prey use by coyotes (Canis latrans) by sampling scats from within known territories in southeastern Alabama and the Savannah River area of Georgia and South Carolina. We accounted for the size and habitat composition of coyote home ranges to investigate the influence of space use, vegetation density, and habitat type on coyote diets. Coyote use of prey was influenced by a combination of mean monthly temperature, home range size, vegetation density, and hardwood forests. For example, coyote use of adult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was associated with cooler months and smaller home ranges, whereas use of rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.) was associated with cooler months, larger home ranges, and less vegetation density. Coyotes in our study relied primarily on nutritionally superior mammalian prey and supplemented their diet with fruit when available, as their use of mammalian prey did not appreciably decrease with increasing use of fruit. We suggest that differential use of prey by coyotes is influenced by habitat heterogeneity within their home ranges, and prey-switching behaviors may stabilize local interactions between coyotes and their food resources to permit stable year-round territories. Given that habitat composition affects coyote prey use, future studies should also incorporate effects of habitat composition on coyote distribution and abundance to further identify coyote influences on prey communities."
https://openalex.org/W2896157299,"Mutations in the a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif-like 2 ( ADAMTSL2) gene are responsible for the autosomal recessive form of geleophysic dysplasia, which is characterized by short stature, short extremities, and skeletal abnormalities. However, the exact function of ADAMTSL2 is unknown. To elucidate the role of this protein in skeletal development, we generated complementary knockout (KO) mouse models with either total or chondrocyte Adamtsl2 deficiency. We observed that the Adamtsl2 KO mice displayed skeletal abnormalities reminiscent of the human phenotype. Adamtsl2 deletion affected the growth plate formation with abnormal differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes. In addition, a TGF-β signaling impairment in limbs lacking Adamtsl2 was demonstrated. Further investigations revealed that Adamtsl2 KO chondrocytes failed to establish a microfibrillar network composed by fibrillin1 and latent TGF-β binding protein 1 fibrils. Chondrocyte Adamtsl2 KO mice also exhibited dwarfism. These studies uncover the function of Adamtsl2 in the maintenance of the growth plate ECM by modulating the microfibrillar network.-Delhon, L., Mahaut, C., Goudin, N., Gaudas, E., Piquand, K., Le Goff, W., Cormier-Daire, V., Le Goff, C.

https://openalex.org/W2897348401,"Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare inherited autosomal recessive or X-linked disorder that mainly affects lungs. Dysfunction of respiratory cilia causes symptoms such as chronic rhinosinusitis, coughing, rhinitis, conductive hearing loss and recurrent lung infections with bronchiectasis. It is now well known that pathogenic genetic changes lead to ciliary dysfunction. Here we report usage of clinical-exome based NGS approach in order to reveal underlying genetic causes in cohort of 21 patient with diagnosis of PCD. By detecting 18 (12 novel) potentially pathogenic genetic variants, we established the genetic cause of 11 (9 unrelated) patients. Genetic variants were detected in six PCD disease-causing genes, as well as in SPAG16 and SPAG17 genes, that were not detected in PCD patients so far, but were related to some symptoms of PCD. The most frequently mutated gene in our cohort was DNAH5 (27.77%). Identified variants were in homozygous, compound heterozygous and trans-heterozygous state. For detailed characterization of one novel homozygous genetic variant in DNAI1 gene (c. 947_948insG, p. Thr318TyrfsTer11), RT-qPCR and Western Blot analysis were performed. Molecular diagnostic approach applied in this study enables analysis of 29 PCD disease-causing and related genes. It resulted in mutation detection rate of 50% and enabled discovery of twelve novel mutations and pointed two possible novel PCD candidate genes."
https://openalex.org/W2801912856,"Water yam (Dioscorea alata L.) is one of the most important food yams with wide geographical distribution in the tropics. One of the major constraints to water yam production is anthracnose disease caused by a fungus, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.). There are no economically feasible solutions as chemical sprays or cultural practices, such as crop rotation are seldom convenient for smallholder farmers for sustainable control of the disease. Breeding for development of durable genetic resistant varieties is known to offer lasting solution to control endemic disease threats to crop production. However, breeding for resistance to anthracnose has been slow considering the biological constraints related to the heterozygous and vegetative propagation of the crop. The development of saturated linkage maps with high marker density, such as SSRs, followed by identification of QTLs can accelerate the speed and precision of resistance breeding in water yam. In a previous study, a total of 1,152 EST-SSRs were developed from >40,000 EST-sequences generated from two D. alata genotypes. A set of 380 EST-SSRs were validated as polymorphic when tested on two diverse parents targeted for anthracnose disease and were used to generate a saturated linkage map. Majority of the SSRs (60.2%) showed Mendelian segregation pattern and had no effect on the construction of linkage map. All 380 EST-SSRs were mapped into 20 linkage groups, and covered a total length of 3229.5 cM. Majority of the markers were mapped on linkage group 1 (LG 1) comprising of 97 EST-SSRs. This is the first genetic linkage map of water yam constructed using EST-SSRs. QTL localization was based on phenotypic data collected over a 3-year period of inoculating the mapping population with the most virulent strain of C. gloeosporioides from West Africa. Based on threshold LOD scores, one QTL was consistently observed on LG 14 in all the three years and average score data. This QTL was found at position interval of 71.1–84.8 cM explaining 68.5% of the total phenotypic variation in the average score data. The high marker density allowed identification of QTLs and association for anthracnose disease, which could be validated in other mapping populations and used in marker-assisted breeding in D. alata improvement programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2950704244,"There is a need to develop effective techniques for establishing native vegetation in dryland ecosystems. We developed a novel treatment that primes (hydrates) seeds in a matrix of absorbent materials and bio-stimulants and then forms the mixture into pods for planting. In the development process, we determined optimal conditions for priming seeds and then compared seedling emergence from non-treated seeds, non-primed-seed pods, and primed-seed pods. Emergence trials were conducted on soils collected from a hillslope and ridgetop location on the Kaibab Plateau, Arizona, USA. Poa fendleriana and Pseudoroegneria spicata were used as test species. Seeds were primed from -0.5 to -2.5 MPa for up to 12 d. Seeds primed under drier conditions (-1.5 to -2.5 MPa) tended to have quicker germination. Days to 50% emergence for primed-seed pods was between 66.2 to 82.4% faster (5.2 to 14.5 d fewer) than non-treated seeds. Seedling emergence from primed-seed pods for P. fendleriana was 3.8-fold higher than non-treated seeds on the ridgetop soil, but no difference was found on the other soil. Final density of P. spicata primed-seed pods were 2.9 to 3.8-fold higher than non-treated seeds. Overall, primed-seed pods show promise for enhancing germination and seedling emergence, which could aid in native plant establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2896255684,"In humans, vitamin B12 deficiency causes peripheral and CNS manifestations. Loss of myelin in the peripheral nerves and the spinal cord (SC) contributes to peripheral neuropathy and motor deficits. The metabolic basis for the demyelination and brain disorder is unknown. The transcobalamin receptor-knockout mouse ( Cd320-/-) develops cobalamin (Cbl) deficiency in the nervous system, with mild anemia. A decreased S-adenosylmethionine: S-adenosylhomocysteine ratio and increased methionine were seen in the brain with no significant changes in neurotransmitter metabolites. The structural pathology in the SC presented as loss of myelin in the axonal tracts with inflammation. The sciatic nerve (SN) showed increased nonuniform, internodal segments suggesting demyelination, and remyelination in progress. Consistent with these changes, the Cd320-/- mouse showed an increased latency to thermal nociception. Further, lower amplitude of compound action potential in the SN suggested that the functional capacity of the heavily myelinated axons were preferentially compromised, leading to loss of peripheral sensation. Although the metabolic basis for the demyelination and the structural and functional alterations of the nervous system in Cbl deficiency remain unresolved, the Cd320-/- mouse provides a unique model to investigate the pathologic consequences of vitamin B12 deficiency. -Arora, K., Sequeira, J.

https://openalex.org/W2897121355,"A two-stage decomposition approach based on a novel multi-agent system (MAS) is proposed for the distributed resource constrained multi-project scheduling problem (DRCMPSP). In stage one, from the point of view of each local project manager, a forward-backward hybrid genetic algorithm (FBHGA) is developed to generate an initial local schedule with the objective of minimizing individual project makespan. In stage two, from the global perspective of project management office, a sequential game-based negotiation mechanism is employed to eliminate global resource conflicts with the objective of minimizing total tardiness cost (TTC). The proposed approach is tested on 140 benchmark problem instances. According to the computational results, high-quality local project schedules can be obtained by FBHGA in stage one. Furthermore, it is observed that our method is capable of dealing with various complex multi-project instances under different degrees of resource conflicts in reasonable CPU running time. Compared to the existing decentralized methods for DRCMPSP, the proposed approach with sequential game-based negotiation mechanism shows the superiority in producing multi-project schedules with lower TTC, especially for large-size and strong conflicting instances."
https://openalex.org/W2897464774,"Introduction For optimal treatment of femoral fractures, it is essential to understand the anatomical antecurvation of the human femur. Recent clinical studies have highlighted the problem of distal anterior encroachment or even perforation of the nail tip. The aim of this study was to accurately describe the femoral antecurvation in a large cohort. Another objective was to identify the most important influences on femoral antecurvation, such as age, femur length, gender and ethnicity. Methods A three dimensional modelling and analytical technology was applied for the analysis of 1,232 femurs. Individual femoral antecurvation was precisely computed to determine whether gender, femur length, age, ethnicity or body mass index influence the radius of curvature (ROC). Results The calculated mean ROC for all femurs was 943 mm. The lowest ROC of 826 mm was found in female Asian femurs. A regression analysis demonstrated that age and femur length could predict the variability of the curvature, with femoral length as most powerful predictor. A matched pair subgroup analysis between Asians and Caucasians could not show any significant differences of ROC values. Conclusions The mean radius of the femoral antecurvation may be smaller than previously reported revealing a significant mismatch between the actual individual anatomy and existing implants. In opposite to existing literature, this study suggests, that antecurvation differences between various ethnicities may exclusively be attributed to differences in femoral length and age. The findings of this study may be found helpful in the development of novel designs for intra- and extramedullary implants."
https://openalex.org/W2950630417,"Gastric cancer is the third most common cause of death from cancer in the world and it remains difficult to cure in Western countries, primarily because most patients present with advanced disease. Currently, CEA, CA50 and CA72-4 are commonly used as tumor markers for gastric cancer by immunoassays. However, the drawback and conundrum of immunoassay are the unceasing problem in standardization of quality of antibodies and time/effort for the intensive production. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of a standardized assay to detect gastric cancer at the early stage. Aptamers are DNA or RNA oligonucleotides with structural domain which recognize ligands such as proteins with superior affinity and specificity when compared to antibodies. In this study, SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment) technique was adopted to screen a random 30mer RNA library for aptamers targeting CEA, CA50 and CA72-4 respectively. Combined with high-throughput sequencing, we identified 6 aptamers which specifically target for these three biomarkers of gastrointestinal cancer. Intriguingly, the predicted secondary structures of RNA aptamers from each antigen showed significant structural similarity, suggesting the structural recognition between the aptamers and the antigens. Moreover, we determined the dissociation constants of all the aptamers to their corresponding antigens by fluorescence spectroscopy, which further demonstrated high affinities between the aptamers and the antigens. In addition, immunostaining of gastric adenocarcinoma cell line AGS using CEA Aptamer probe showed positive fluorescent signal which proves the potential of the aptamer as a detection tool for gastric cancer. Furthermore, substantially decreased cell viability and growth were observed when human colorectal cell line LS-174T was transfected with each individual aptamers. Taking together, these novel RNA aptamers targeting gastrointestinal cancer biomarker CEA, CA50 and CA72-4 will aid further development and standardization of clinical diagnostic method with better sensitivity and specificity, and potentially future therapeutics development of gastric cancer."

This study presents a new dual sequential codend concept with the aim of improving the quality of trawl-caught fish by minimizing the frequency and severity of catch damage. During towing, the fish are retained in an anterior codend segment with the legislated mesh size. A quality improving codend segment, is attached to the aft part of the first codend segment. Its entrance is closed during the towing phase and opened at a predefined depth during haul-back. Comparing the quality of cod (Gadus morhua L.) retained in the sequential codend with cod caught in a conventional codend, demonstrated a significant improvement in the catch quality, i.e. reduction in catch damages. Cod caught in a conventional codend had only a 3.6% probability of being without visually detectable catch damage. The probability for catching cod without catch damage was five times higher when using the dual sequential codend. Furthermore, cod caught in the sequential codend had a significantly reduced probability of incurring specific catch damage, such as gear marks, poor exsanguination, ecchymosis, and skin abrasions."

This study aimed to investigate white matter integrity in the corpus callosum and connections between regions of interests (ROIs) in the same hemisphere in 122 patients with SZ and 129 healthy controls with public neuroimaging data from SchizConnect. For each diffusion-weighted image (DWI), two-tensor full-brain tractography was performed; DWIs were parcellated by processing and registering T1 images with FreeSurfer and Advanced Normalization Tools. White matter query language was used to extract white matter fiber tracts. We evaluated group differences in means of diffusion measures between the patients and controls, and correlations of diffusion measures with the severity of clinical symptoms and cognitive impairment in the patients using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), a letter-number sequencing (LNS) test, vocabulary test, letter fluency test, category fluency test, and trail-making test, part A. To correct for multiple comparisons, a false discovery rate of q < 0.05 was applied. In patients with SZ, we observed significant radial diffusivity (RD) and trace (TR) increases in left thalamo-occipital tracts and the right uncinate fascicle, and a significant RD increase in the right middle longitudinal fascicle (MDLF) and the right superior longitudinal fascicle ii. Correlations were present between TR of left thalamo-occipital tracts, and the letter fluency test and the LNS test, and RD in the right MDLF and PANSS positive subscale score. However, these correlations were not significant after correction for multiple comparisons. These results indicated widespread white matter fiber tract abnormalities in patients with SZ, contributing to SZ pathophysiology."

The aim of the study was to compare the effects of attending a progressive core-training program on climbing performance. 19 advanced and elite climbers (7.3±5.6 years climbing experience, red point skill grade 19 IRCRA) were randomized into a dynamic (DCT) or isometric (ICT) core training group and trained twice weekly for ten weeks. The climbers were tested using two climbing-specific core tests (body lock-off and body-lift) and four non-specific core strength tests—one dynamic (superman) and three isometric (trunk flexion and trunk rotation left and right). Between group comparisons showed no differences between the groups at post-test (p = 0.328–0.824) and neither group demonstrated greater improvement compared with the other (p = 0.300–0.926). The ICT group demonstrated 10.8% and 29.6% improvement in trunk flexion and body-lift (p = 0.029–0.037 with no improvement in body lock-off and rotation (p = 0.101–0.343). The DCT group demonstrated 5.0–14.9% improvement in the core strength tests (p = 0.012–0.043), a non-significant 33.8% improvement in body-lift (p = 0.100) and no improvement in body lock-off (p = 0.943). In conclusion, none of the training groups demonstrated greater improvement than the other and both dynamic and isometric core training improved climbing-specific test performance. Dynamic training was slightly more favorable although not significantly superior to isometric core training in improving core strength."
https://openalex.org/W2896643719,"During DNA replication or repair, the DNA polymerase cofactor, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), homotrimerizes and encircles the replicating DNA, thereby acting as a DNA clamp that promotes DNA polymerase processivity. The formation of the PCNA trimer is also essential for targeting the replication-licensing protein, chromatin-licensing, and DNA replication factor 1 (CDT1), for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis to prevent chromosomal DNA re-replication. CDT1 uses its PCNA-interacting peptide box (PIP box) to interact with PCNA, and the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit CDT2 is recruited through the formation of PCNA–CDT1 complexes. However, it remains unclear how CDT1 and many other PIP box–containing proteins are marked for degradation by the CRL4CDT2 ubiquitin ligase during DNA replication or damage. Here, using recombinant protein expression coupled with site-directed mutagenesis, we report that CDT2 and PCNA directly interact and this interaction depends on the presence of a highly conserved, C-terminal PIP box–like region in CDT2. Deletion or mutation of this region abolished the CDT2–PCNA interaction between CDT2 and PCNA both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, PCNA-dependent CDT1 degradation in response to DNA damage and replication during the cell cycle requires an intact PIP box in CDT2.

The requirement of the PIP boxes in both CDT2 and its substrate CDT1 suggests that the formation of the PCNA trimeric clamp around DNA during DNA replication and repair may bring together CDT1 and CRL4CDT2 ubiquitin E3 ligase to target CDT1 for proteolysis in a DNA synthesis–dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2896563338,"Humans visually process human body images depending on the configuration of the parts. However, little is known about whether this function is evolutionarily shared with nonhuman animals. In this study, we examined the body posture discrimination performance of capuchin monkeys, a highly social platyrrhine primate, in comparison to humans. We demonstrate that, like humans, monkeys exhibit a body inversion effect: body posture discrimination is impaired by inversion, which disrupts the configural relationships of body parts. The inversion effect in monkeys was observed when human body images were used, but not when the body parts were replaced with cubic and cylindrical figures, the positions of the parts were scrambled, or only part of a body was presented. Results in human participants showed similar patterns, though they also showed the inversion effect when the cubic/cylindrical body images were used. These results provide the first evidence for configural processing of body forms in monkeys and suggest that the visual attunement to social signals mediated by body postures is conserved through the evolution of primate vision."
https://openalex.org/W2896777511,"Background In diabetes research, the development of the artificial pancreas has been a major topic since continuous glucose monitoring became available in the early 2000’s. A prerequisite for an artificial pancreas is fast and reliable glucose sensing. However, subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring carries the disadvantage of slow dynamics. As an alternative, we explored continuous glucose sensing in the peritoneal space, and investigated potential spatial differences in glucose dynamics within the peritoneal cavity. As a secondary outcome, we compared the glucose dynamics in the peritoneal space to the subcutaneous tissue. Material and methods Eight-hour experiments were conducted on 12 anesthetised non-diabetic pigs. Four commercially available amperometric glucose sensors (FreeStyle Libre, Abbott Diabetes Care Ltd., Witney, UK) were inserted in four different locations of the peritoneal cavity and two sensors were inserted in the subcutaneous tissue. Meals were simulated by intravenous infusions of glucose, and frequent arterial blood and intraperitoneal fluid samples were collected for glucose reference. Results No significant differences were discovered in glucose dynamics between the four quadrants of the peritoneal cavity. The intraperitoneal sensors responded faster to the glucose excursions than the subcutaneous sensors, and the time delay was significantly smaller for the intraperitoneal sensors, but we did not find significant results when comparing the other dynamic parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2897143710,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an increased risk of hepatitis B infection and impaired seroconversion to hepatitis B vaccine (HBV). Studies examining augmented vaccine schedules to enhance seroconversion have so far been inconclusive. Furthermore, the defects responsible for impaired vaccine immunity in CKD have not yet been identified. Methods We studied serological and cellular responses to HBV in CKD to identify a defect in vaccine-induced cellular responses that could account for impaired seroconversion in CKD and clarify the effects of an augmented vaccine dose schedule. We compared these results with responses to seasonal influenza vaccination (Fluvax). Results We found a clear benefit in rates and magnitude of seroconversion after an augmented 40mcg HBV dose schedule in CKD. This permitted comparison of responders and non-responders. Serological non-responders with CKD exhibited reduction in CXCR3+CCR6- CXCR5+ memory T cells at baseline. Unlike Fluvax, HBV elicited a poor plasmablast (PB) response. Both vaccinations induced activation of the CXCR3+CCR6- CCR7- subset of circulating T follicular helper cells (cTFH), although this response was impaired in CKD after HBV. Conclusions CKD confers a specific T cell defect that contributes to the impaired seroconversion to HBV."
https://openalex.org/W2896341121,"Remodeling of the gut microbiota is implicated in various metabolic and inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. We hypothesized that the gut microbiota affects the DNA methylation profile of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) which could, in turn, alter intestinal function. In this study, we used mass spectrometry and methylated DNA capture to respectively investigate global and genome-wide DNA methylation of intestinal epithelial cells from germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised mice. In colonic IECs from GF mice, DNA was markedly hypermethylated. This was associated with a dramatic loss of ten-eleven-translocation activity, a lower DNA methyltransferase activity and lower circulating levels of the 1-carbon metabolite, folate. At the gene level, we found an enrichment for differentially methylated regions proximal to genes regulating the cytotoxicity of NK cells (false-discovery rate < 8.9E−6), notably genes regulating the cross-talk between NK cells and target cells, such as members of the NK group 2 member D ligand superfamily Raet. This distinct epigenetic signature was associated with a marked decrease in Raet1 expression and a loss of CD56+/CD45+ cells in the intestine of GF mice. Thus, our results indicate that altered activity of methylation-modifying enzymes in GF mice influences the IEC epigenome and modulates the crosstalk between IECs and NK cells. Epigenetic reprogramming of IECs may modulate intestinal function in diseases associated with altered gut microbiota.—Poupeau, A., Garde, C., Sulek, K., Citirikkaya, K., Treebak, J.

https://openalex.org/W2896498492,"Preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes precedes 30–40% of preterm births. Activation of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) is the one of the major causes of extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation in membrane rupture. Increased cortisol, regenerated by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 in the amnion at parturition, is known to participate in a number of parturition-pertinent events. However, whether cortisol has a role in the regulation of MMPs in the membranes is not known. Here, we addressed this issue using human amnion tissue, the most tensile layer of the membranes. RNA-sequencing revealed that cortisol induced MMP7 expression dramatically in amnion fibroblasts, which was confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis in cortisol-treated amnion explants and fibroblasts. Measurement of collagen IV α5 chain (COL4A5), a substrate for MMP-7, showed that cortisol reduced its extracellular abundance, which was blocked by an antibody against MMP-7. Moreover, increased MMP-7 but decreased COL4A5 abundance was observed in the amnion tissue following labor-initiated spontaneous rupture of membranes. Mechanistic studies showed that cortisol increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun and the expression of c-Fos, the 2 major components of activated protein 1 (AP-1), respectively. The knocking down of c-Fos or c-Jun significantly attenuated the induction of MMP7 expression by cortisol. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that cortisol stimulated the enrichment of c-Fos and c-Jun at the AP-1 binding site in the MMP7 promoter. The data suggest that induction of MMP7 by cortisol via AP-1 may be a contributing factor to ECM degradation in membrane rupture at parturition.—Wang, L.-Y., Wang, W.-S., Wang, Y.-W., Lu, J.-W., Lu, Y., Zhang, C.-Y., Li, W.-J., Sun, K., Ying, H.

https://openalex.org/W2950907456,"During pregnancy, women experience numerous physiological changes but, to date, there is limited published data that characterize accompanying changes in gene expression over pregnancy. This study sought to characterize the complexity of the transcriptome over the course of pregnancy among women with healthy pregnancies. Subjects provided a venous blood sample during early (6–15 weeks) and late (22–33 weeks) pregnancy, which was used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells prior to RNA extraction. Gene expression was examined for 63 women with uncomplicated, term deliveries. We evaluated the association between weeks gestation at sample collection and expression of each transcript. Of the 16,311 transcripts evaluated, 439 changed over pregnancy after a Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons. Genes whose expression increased over pregnancy were associated with oxygen transport, the immune system, and host response to bacteria. Characterization of changes in the transcriptome over the course of healthy term pregnancies may enable the identification of genes whose expression predicts complications or adverse outcomes of pregnancy."

In the present study, the catalytic wet oxidation (CWO) of pharmaceutical sludge by CuO-CeO2/γ-Al2O3 as the catalyst was investigated. The catalyst was prepared by traditional wet impregnation. The catalyst was characterized using X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). CWO was performed in an experimental batch reactor. Several parameters that could affect the catalytic degradation efficiency, including catalyst dose, temperature, time, oxygen pressure and pH, were investigated. Under optimum conditions, the highest removal rate of volatile suspended solids (VSS) was 87.3% and was achieved at 260°C for 60 min with an oxygen pressure of 1.0 MPa and 10 g/L of catalyst. At the same time, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate reached as high as 72.6%. This work implies that catalytic wet oxidation is a promising method for the highly efficient degradation of pharmaceutical sludge."
https://openalex.org/W2897339407,"The treatment effect of the hybrid procedure, consisting of a thoracoscopic ablation followed by an endocardial radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA), is unclear. A total of 117 ablation-naïve patients who underwent either the staged hybrid procedure (n = 72) or RFCA alone (n = 105) for drug-refractory, non-valvular persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) were enrolled. The primary outcome is occurrence of total atrial arrhythmia, defined as a composite of AF, sustained atrial tachycardia (AT), and atypical atrial flutter (AFL) after index procedure. The mean age was 52.7 years. Eighty-four percentage of the patients were male. Patients with prior history of stroke and long-standing persistent AF were more prevalent in the hybrid group than RFCA group. The left atrial volume index was larger in the hybrid group (P<0.001). During 2.1 years of median follow-up, the incidence of total atrial arrhythmia was not different between the two groups (32.5% vs. 35.7%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.36–1.14; P = 0.13). The AF recurrence was significantly lower in the hybrid group than in the RFCA group (29.6% vs. 34.9%; adjusted HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.29–0.99; P = 0.046). The hospital stay was longer in the hybrid group than in the RFCA group (11 days vs. 4 days; P<0.001). A staged hybrid procedure may be an alternative choice for drug-refractory persistent AF, but it is no more effective than RFCA alone to eliminate atrial arrhythmias. Considering the long-length of stay and the morbidity, careful consideration should be given in selection of treatment strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2760927142,"Creating inclusive cities requires meaningful responses to inequality and segregation. We build an agent-based model of interactions between wealth and ethnicity of agents to investigate ‘dual’ segregations—due to ethnicity and due to wealth. As agents are initially allowed to move into neighbourhoods they cannot afford, we find a regime where there is marginal increase in both wealth segregation and ethnic segregation. However, as more agents are progressively allowed entry into unaffordable neighbourhoods, we find that both wealth and ethnic segregations undergo sharp, non-linear transformations, but in opposite directions—wealth segregation shows a dramatic decline, while ethnic segregation an equally sharp upsurge. We argue that the decrease in wealth segregation does not merely accompany, but actually drives the increase in ethnic segregation. Essentially, as agents are progressively allowed into neighbourhoods in contravention of affordability, they create wealth configurations that enable a sharp decline in wealth segregation, which at the same time allow co-ethnics to spatially congregate despite differences in wealth, resulting in the abrupt worsening of ethnic segregation."
https://openalex.org/W2896385798,"“Vital” dyes such as fluorescein and rose bengal are used clinically to evaluate ocular surface health; however, staining mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that sublethal cell damage stimulates fluorescein dye uptake. Since damage can also stimulate reparative plasma membrane remodeling, we hypothesized that dye uptake occurs via endocytic vesicles. Using an oxidative stress model, we show that damage to relatively undifferentiated monolayer cultures of human corneal epithelial cells stimulates uptake of fluorescein and rose bengal dyes and also stimulates endocytosis. Importantly, dye uptake was blocked by co-treatment with three different endocytosis inhibitors. Damage to stratified and differentiated corneal epithelial cell cultures, which are a better model of the ocular surface, also stimulated dye uptake; however, endocytosis was not stimulated in this case, and two of the inhibitors did not block dye uptake. The exception was the inhibitor Dynasore and its more potent analogue Dyngo-4a, small molecules that target dynamin family GTPases, but also have off-target effects on the plasma membrane. Significantly, while Dynasore blocked stress-stimulated dye uptake at the ocular surface of ex vivo mouse eyes when treatment was performed at the same time as eyes were stressed, it had no effect when used after stress was applied and the ocular surface was already damaged. Thus, Dynasore could not be working by inhibiting endocytosis. Employing cytotoxicity and western blotting assays, we demonstrate an alternative mechanism, showing that Dynasore is remarkably protective of cells and their surface glycocalyx, preventing damage due to oxidative stress, and thus precluding dye entry. These unexpected and novel findings provide greater insight into mechanisms of vital dye uptake and emphasize the importance of using a differentiated cell culture model for such studies. They also suggest that Dynasore and analogues might be used therapeutically to protect the ocular surface and to treat ocular surface disease."
https://openalex.org/W2895827915,"Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a benign disease caused by human papillomavirus 6 and 11. The characteristic feature of this disease are wart-like lesions covering the respiratory epithelium with a predilection for the larynx. There is no curative treatment for the disease. The goal of the treatment is a total surgical removal of the papillomatous lesions in order to reduce the number of relapses. Therefore, a good visualization method of papillomas is crucial during surgery. The aim of the study was to compare the accuracy of narrow band imaging (NBI) to the use of white light alone in detecting RRP.The study was carried out between April 2013 and November 2015 at Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Department of Otolaryngology, Poland. Rigid endoscopy with conventional white light (WL) and NBI (CV-260SL processor and CLV- 260SL light source, Olympus Optical Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was performed in all patients during direct laryngoscopy. All anatomical sites of the larynx and trachea were assessed using the Dikkers scale and Derkay total site scoring system with WL and NBI. The consensus was reached as to the number of lesions seen in WL compared to NBI.During 36 microlaryngoscopies, the number of papillomas detected in the larynx (by Derkay total site score) differed significantly between white light endoscopy and NBI (Wilcoxon test p = 0.000655). In endoscopy with NBI, a mean of 1.3 more papillomas in Derkay total site score was detected in comparison to white light endoscopy NBI showed additional areas of diseased tissue in 15/36 (41.67%) patients.NBI as an additional tool during microlaryngoscopy can improve the detection of papillomatous lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2896487078,"Objectives Persistent developmental stuttering is a speech fluency disorder defined by its symptoms, where the underlying neurophysiological causes remain uncertain. This study examined the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of the speech planning process, using facilitation in the motor cortex during speech preparation as an analogue. Methods transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs), which were recorded from the tongue. Eighteen adults who stutter (AWS) and 17 adults who do not stutter (ANS) completed three experiments, which involved reading a German prefix+verb utterance from a screen. Each experiment involved 120 trials with three distinct levels of speech production: immediate speech, delayed speech without pacing and delayed speech with predefined pacing. TMS was applied shortly before speech onset. Trial MEPs were normalised to average non-speech MEPs. MEP amplitude, MEP facilitation ratio (amplitude: pre-speech offset) and group difference were the outcomes of interest analysed by multiple regression, as well as speech reaction time analysed by correlation. Results MEP values were 11·1%-23·4% lower in AWS than ANS (by standardised Beta), across all three experiments. MEP facilitation ratio slopes were also 4·9%-18·3% flatter in AWS than ANS across all three experiments. Reaction times for AWS were only significantly slower than for ANS in immediate speech and predefined pacing experiments. No stuttering was detected during the trials. The group difference in immediate speech was 100% and 101% greater than the other two experiments respectively. Discussion While performance of both ANS and AWS worsens under disturbed speech conditions, greater disturbance conditions affected controls worse than AWS. Future research and therapy in stuttering should focus on non-disturbed speech."

However, these specimens are often degraded, losing diagnostic morphological characteristics. Several tubes of vestimentiferans, conspicuous annelids endemic to chemosynthetic environments, were obtained from a single batch of deep-sea fishing bycatch at depths of around 1,500 m off Huasco, northern Chile, as part of an ongoing study examining bycatch species. DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and an intron region within the hemoglobin subunit B2 (hbB2i) were successfully determined using vestimentiferans’ dried-up tubes and their degraded inner tissue. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequence identified the samples as Escarpia spicata Jones, 1985, and Lamellibrachia barhami Webb, 1969. These are the southernmost records, vastly extending the geographical ranges of both species from Santa Catalina Island, California to northern Chile for E. spicata (over 8,000 km), and from Vancouver Island Margin to northern Chile for L. barhami (over 10,000 km). We also determined a 16S rRNA sequence of symbiotic bacteria of L. barhami. The sequence of the bacteria is the same as that of E. laminata, Lamellibrachia sp. 1, and Lamellibrachia sp.2 known from the Gulf of Mexico.

https://openalex.org/W2896706338,"Working together allows social animals to accomplish tasks beyond the abilities of solitary individuals, but the benefits of cooperation must be balanced with the costs of coordination. Many ant species form cooperative groups to transport items too large for a single ant. However, transport by groups is often slower and less efficient than that of lone ants, for reasons that remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that groups are slower when porters must encircle the load to carry it, because this arrangement places ants in a variety of postures relative to the load and the direction of travel. Porters may therefore have difficulty maximizing individual forces and aligning them with those of other group members. Experiments on the desert ant Novomessor cockerelli, an adept cooperative transporter, did not support this hypothesis. Groups ranging in size from one to four ants were induced to carry loads such that all porters were aligned with one another. Load weight was adjusted so that all porters pulled the same per capita weight, but lone porters were nonetheless faster than groups of any size. As group size increased, porters persisted in carrying the load for longer periods before letting go. We used simulations to explore a scenario in which ants vary in their intrinsic speed and the group's speed is limited by that of its slowest member. This proposed mechanism is analogous to other social groups where group efficiency is determined by the weakest link. We discuss how interactions among porters, mediated by the load itself, might explain such a constraint."
https://openalex.org/W2897024970,"In order to proliferate and mount an infection, many bacterial pathogens need to acquire iron from their host. The most abundant iron source in the body is the oxygen transporter hemoglobin (Hb). Streptococcus pyogenes, a potentially lethal human pathogen, uses the Shr protein to capture Hb on the cell surface. Shr is an important virulence factor, yet the mechanism by which it captures Hb and acquires its heme is not well-understood. Here, we show using NMR and biochemical methods that Shr binds Hb using two related modules that were previously defined as domains of unknown function (DUF1533). These hemoglobin-interacting domains (HIDs), called HID1 and HID2, are autonomously folded and independently bind Hb. The 1.5 Å resolution crystal structure of HID2 revealed that it is a structurally unique Hb-binding domain. Mutagenesis studies revealed a conserved tyrosine in both HIDs that is essential for Hb binding. Our biochemical studies indicate that HID2 binds Hb with higher affinity than HID1 and that the Hb tetramer is engaged by two Shr receptors. NMR studies reveal the presence of a third autonomously folded domain between HID2 and a heme-binding NEAT1 domain, suggesting that this linker domain may position NEAT1 near Hb for heme capture.

This process occurs very rapidly, >100,000 times faster than the rate at which Shp spontaneously releases hemin into the solvent. Hemin is then presumably transported across the membrane into the bacterial cytoplasm where it is degraded by a yet to be identified oxygenase(s) that releases hemin’s iron for use by the microbe (6Ge R.

Unlike other Hb receptors in Gram-positive bacteria, the S. pyogenes Shr protein does not use NEAT domains to engage Hb. Instead, it binds Hb via an N-terminal region (NTR) that is predicted to contain two domains of unknown function, called DUF1533 domains (Fig. 1) (8Ouattara M. Cunha E.B. Li X. Huang Y.S. Dixon D.

https://openalex.org/W2897356309,"Background Rising-to-walk is an everyday transitional movement task rarely employed in gait rehabilitation. Sit-to-walk (STW) and sit-to-stand-and-walk (STSW), where a pause separates sit-to-stand and gait-initiation (GI) represent extremes of rising-to-walk behaviour. Delayed GI can indicate pathological impairment but is also observed in healthy individuals. We hypothesise that healthy subjects express consistent biomechanical parameters, among others that differ, during successful rising-to-walk task performance regardless of behaviour. This study therefore sought to identify if any parameters are consistent between STW and STSW in health because they represent normal rise-to-walk performance independent of pause, and also because they represent candidate parameters sensitive enough to monitor change in pathology. Methods Ten healthy volunteers performed 5 trials of STW and STSW. Event timing, ground-reaction-forces (GRFs), whole-body-centre-of-mass (BCoM) displacement, and centre-of-pressure (CoP) to extrapolated BCoM (xCoM) distance (indicator of positional stability) up to the 3rd step were compared between-tasks with paired t-tests. For consistent parameters; agreement between-tasks was assessed using Bland-Altman analyses and minimal-detectable-change (MDC) calculations. Results Mean vertical GRFs, peak forward momentum and fluidity during rising; CoP-xCoM separation at seat-off, upright, GI-onset, and steps1-2; and forward BCoM velocity were all significantly greater in STW. In contrast, peak BCoM vertical momentum, flexion-momentum time, and 3rd step stability were consistent between tasks and yielded acceptable reliability. Conclusion STW is a more challenging task due to the merging of rising with GI reflected by greater CoP-xCoM separation compared to STSW indicative of more positional instability. However, BCoM vertical momentum, flexion-momentum time, and step3 stability remained consistent in healthy individuals and are therefore candidates with which to monitor change in gait rehabilitation following pathology. Future studies should impose typical pause-durations observed in pathology upon healthy subjects to determine if the parameters we have identified remain consistent."

In this study, our genome-wide analyses reveal that puromycin treatment or UVC irradiation stabilizes poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs, relative to canonical RDH mRNAs, which end in an SL structure. We demonstrate that the stabilization of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs occurs in a translation-independent manner and is regulated via human antigen R (HuR) binding to the extended 3′ UTR under stress conditions. Our data suggest that HuR regulates the expression of poly(A)+ RDH mRNAs.—Ryu, I., Park, Y., Seo, J.-W., Park, O. H., Ha, H., Nam, J.-W., Kim, Y. K.

https://openalex.org/W2897671151,"Adaptor protein p66Shc is overexpressed in smooth muscle cells of renal resistance vessels of hypertensive salt-sensitive rats and is involved in the regulation of renal vascular tone. We applied 2-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy to analyze spontaneous dynamic fluctuations in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in smooth muscle cells embedded in the walls of freshly isolated renal resistance arteries. The amplitude, number of events, and frequency of spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations triggered by endogenously released endothelin-1 were recorded in smooth muscle cells of the renal arteries. Endothelin receptor A antagonist BQ123 dramatically reduced the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ events, producing marked inhibition of renal vessels spontaneous motion. Spontaneous Ca2+ fluctuations in smooth muscle cells of p66Shc knockout (p66ShcKO) rats had significantly higher amplitude than in control rats. The frequency of spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations did not change in p66ShcKO rats, suggesting that p66Shc expression did not affect endothelin-1 release from resident endothelial cells. Acute application of endothelin-1 revealed significantly elevated production of the total [Ca2+]i in p66ShcKO rats. Spontaneous cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in smooth muscle cells of renal vessels mediate their spontaneous motion via the endothelin-1/endothelin receptor A pathway. p66Shc decreases the amplitude of individual changes in [Ca2+]i, which mitigates the spontaneous motion of renal vessels.—Palygin, O., Miller, B. S., Nishijima, Y., Zhang, D. X., Staruschenko, A., Sorokin, A.

https://openalex.org/W2896973056,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with the sequential accumulation of acquired genetic alterations. Although at diagnosis cytogenetic alterations are frequent in AML, roughly 50% of patients present an apparently normal karyotype (NK), leading to a highly heterogeneous prognosis. Due to this significant heterogeneity, it has been suggested that different molecular mechanisms may trigger the disease with diverse prognostic implications. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of tumor-normal matched samples of de novo AML-NK patients lacking mutations in NPM1, CEBPA or FLT3-ITD to identify new gene mutations with potential prognostic and therapeutic relevance to patients with AML. Novel candidate-genes, together with others previously described, were targeted resequenced in an independent cohort of 100 de novo AML patients classified in the cytogenetic intermediate-risk (IR) category. A mean of 4.89 mutations per sample were detected in 73 genes, 35 of which were mutated in more than one patient. After a network enrichment analysis, we defined a single in silico model and established a set of seed-genes that may trigger leukemogenesis in patients with normal karyotype. The high heterogeneity of gene mutations observed in AML patients suggested that a specific alteration could not be as essential as the interaction of deregulated pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2897406257,"The in vivo microenvironment of tissues provides myriad unique signals to cells. Thus, following isolation, many cell types change in culture, often preserving some but not all of their in vivo characteristics in culture. At least some of the in vivo microenvironment may be mimicked by providing specific cues to cultured cells. Here, we show that after isolation and during maintenance in culture, adherent rat islets reduce expression of key β-cell transcription factors necessary for β-cell function and that soluble pancreatic decellularized matrix (DCM) can enhance β-cell gene expression. Following chromatographic fractionation of pancreatic DCM, we performed proteomics to identify soluble factors that can maintain β-cell stability and function. We identified Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) as an extracellular protein that significantly increased the expression of key β-cell genes. The ApoE effect on beta cells was mediated at least in part through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Together, these results reveal a role for ApoE as an extracellular factor that can maintain the mature β-cell gene expression profile."
https://openalex.org/W2897588407,"As the size of networks increases, it is becoming important to analyze large-scale network data. A network clustering algorithm is useful for analysis of network data. Conventional network clustering algorithms in a single machine environment rather than a parallel machine environment are actively being researched. However, these algorithms cannot analyze large-scale network data because of memory size issues. As a solution, we propose a network clustering algorithm for large-scale network data analysis using Apache Spark by changing the paradigm of the conventional clustering algorithm to improve its efficiency in the Apache Spark environment. We also apply optimization approaches such as Bloom filter and shuffle selection to reduce memory usage and execution time. By evaluating our proposed algorithm based on an average normalized cut, we confirmed that the algorithm can analyze diverse large-scale network datasets such as biological, co-authorship, internet topology and social networks. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can develop more accurate clusters than comparative algorithms with less memory usage. Furthermore, we confirm the proposed optimization approaches and the scalability of the proposed algorithm. In addition, we validate that clusters found from the proposed algorithm can represent biologically meaningful functions."
https://openalex.org/W2895790116,"In furtive predation, a predator is able to exploit its prey without generating significant defensive behaviors from them. However, in aphidophagous guild, if furtive predator can benefit from dilution effects generated by the aphids, they also suffer from intraguild predation from more mobile and active-searching predators. In this context ant-tended aphid colonies might not only represent an important food source but also potentially an enemy-free space for furtive predators if they remain unharmed by ants while other active predators are being repelled. Here we use the furtive predator Aphidoletes aphidimyza and two distinct instars of an active-searching predator, the Asian ladybeetle Harmonia axyridis, to test hypotheses related to predator persistence within aphid colonies in presence of ants. Our results show that persistence rate over time of the furtive predator was not affected by ant presence while it was strongly reduced for both instars of the active-searching predator. Furthermore, when ran in paired trials within ant-tended aphid colonies, furtive predator persistence rate was significantly higher than for active-searching predators, with these latter always leaving the plants quicker. Finally, we tested the importance of predator mobility in detection susceptibility and aggressive responses in ants using mobile and immobile active-searching predators. While the number of antennal palpations was similar for both treatments indicating similar detection rate, the number of ant attacks was significantly higher on mobile individuals highlighting the importance of movement in triggering aggressive responses in ants. Overall our results indicate that furtive predation represents an efficient strategy to limit ant aggressions, while the exclusion of active-searching predators might create an enemy-free space for furtive predators within ant-tended aphid colonies."
https://openalex.org/W2896415079,"Public hospital spending consumes a large share of government expenditure in many countries. The large cost variability observed between hospitals and also between patients in the same hospital has fueled the belief that consumption of a significant portion of this funding may result in no clinical benefit to patients, thus representing waste. Accurate identification of the main hospital cost drivers and relating them quantitatively to the observed cost variability is a necessary step towards identifying and reducing waste. This study identifies prime cost drivers in a typical, mid-sized Australian hospital and classifies them as sources of cost variability that are either warranted or not warranted—and therefore contributing to waste. An essential step is dimension reduction using Principal Component Analysis to pre-process the data by separating out the low value ‘noise’ from otherwise valuable information. Crucially, the study then adjusts for possible co-linearity of different cost drivers by the use of the sparse group lasso technique. This ensures reliability of the findings and represents a novel and powerful approach to analysing hospital costs. Our statistical model included 32 potential cost predictors with a sample size of over 50,000 hospital admissions. The proportion of cost variability potentially not clinically warranted was estimated at 33.7%. Given the financial footprint involved, once the findings are extrapolated nationwide, this estimation has far-reaching significance for health funding policy."
https://openalex.org/W2897603998,"Microcephalin-1 (MCPH1) exists as 2 isoforms that regulate cyclin-dependent kinase-1 activation and chromosome condensation during mitosis, with MCPH1 mutations causing primary microcephaly. MCPH1 is also a tumor suppressor protein, with roles in DNA damage repair/checkpoints. Despite these important roles, there is little information on the cellular regulation of MCPH1. We show that both MCPH1 isoforms are phosphorylated in a cyclin-dependent kinase-1-dependent manner in mitosis and identify several novel phosphorylation sites. Upon mitotic exit, MCPH1 isoforms were degraded by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-CDH1 E3 ligase complex. Anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-CDH1 target proteins generally have D-Box or KEN-Box degron sequences. We found that MCPH1 isoforms are degraded independently, with the long isoform degradation being D-Box dependent, whereas the short isoform was KEN-Box dependent. Our research identifies several novel mechanisms regulating MCPH1 and also highlights important issues with several commercial MCPH1 antibodies, with potential relevance to previously published data.-Meyer, S.

https://openalex.org/W2897908298,"During industrial wood drying, extractives migrate towards the wood surfaces and make the material more susceptible to photo/biodegradation. The present work provides information about the distribution, quantity and nature of lipophilic substances beneath the surface in air- and kiln-dried Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sapwood boards. Samples were taken from knot-free sapwood surfaces and the composition of lipophilic extractives, phenols and low-molecular fatty/resin acids layers at different nominal depths below the surface was studied gravimetrically, by UV-spectrometry and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The concentration of total extractives was significantly higher in kiln-dried than in air-dried samples and was higher close to the surface than in the layers beneath. The scatter in the values for the lipophilic extractives was high in both drying types, being highest for linoleic acid and slightly lower for palmitic, oleic and stearic acids. The amount of fatty acids was low in kiln-dried boards, probably due to a stronger degradation due to the high temperature employed. The most abundant resin acid was dehydroabietic acid followed by pimaric, isopimaric, and abietic acids in both drying types. It is concluded that during kiln-drying a migration front is created at a depth of 0.25 mm with a thickness of about 0.5 mm."
https://openalex.org/W2898033288,"In recent years, finding the cause of pathogenesis is expected by observing the cell images. In this paper, we propose a cell particle detection method in cell images. However, there are mainly two kinds of problems in particle detection in cell image. The first is the different properties between cell images and standard images used in computer vision researches. Edges of cell particles are ambiguous, and overlaps between cell particles are often occurred in dense regions. It is difficult to detect cell particles by simple detection method using a binary classifier. The second is the ground truth made by cell biologists. The number of training samples for training a classifier is limited, and incorrect samples are included by the subjectivity of observers. From the background, we propose a cell particle detection method to address those problems. In our proposed method, we predict the center of a cell particle from the peripheral regions by convolutional neural network, and the prediction results are voted. By using the obvious peripheral edges, we can robustly detect overlapped cell particles because all edges of overlapping cell particles are not ambiguous. In addition, voting from peripheral views enables reliable detection. Moreover, our method is useful in practical applications because we can prepare many training samples from a cell particle. In experiments, we evaluate our detection methods on two kinds of cell detection datasets. One is challenging dataset for synthetic cells, and our method achieved the state-of-the-art performance. The other is real dataset of lipid droplets, and our method outperformed the conventional detector using CNN with binary outputs for particles and non-particles classification."
https://openalex.org/W2897382950,"To predict what products customers will buy in next transaction is an important task. Existing work in next-basket prediction can be summarized into two paradigms. One is the item-centric paradigm, where sequential patterns are mined from customers' transactional data and leveraged for prediction. However, these approaches usually suffer from the data sparseness problem. The other is the user-centric paradigm, where collaborative filtering techniques have been applied on customers' historical data. However, these methods ignore the sequential behaviors of customers which is often crucial for next-basket prediction. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid method, namely the Co-Factorization model over Sequential and Historical purchase data (CFSH for short) for next-basket recommendation. Compared with existing methods, our approach conveys the following merits: 1) By mining global sequential patterns, we can avoid the sparseness problem in traditional item-centric methods; 2) By factorizing product-product and customer-product matrices simultaneously, we can fully exploit both sequential and historical behaviors to learn customer and product representations better; 3) By using a hybrid recommendation method, we can achieve better performance in next-basket prediction. Experimental results on three real-world purchase datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach as compared with the state-of-the-art methods."
