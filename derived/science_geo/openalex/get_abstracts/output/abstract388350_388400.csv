The carotene/total-pigment ratio varies among different varieties and within varieties. In the varieties tested, the carotene/total-pigment ratio increased with increase in intensity of yellow color. Triumph, a very light-colored variety, contained a small amount of carotene shortly after harvest, but this soon disappeared in storage."

https://openalex.org/W1980161470,"T HE QUESTION WHICH VITALLY INTERESTS all of us is whether we need to feel undue alarm from a health standpoint at the present-day scarcity in butter. In other words, need we be necessarily distressed not only for our adult population but especially for our growing children if the butter shortage continues over a prolonged period? We have become much more conscious as to what good nutrition involves since the war began. The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council has. published a chart of recommended dietary allowances which have been generally accepted as the most authoritative information to date. In their table, they have separated the requirements not only according to age and sex but also according to the extent of activity. In addition, this committee has suggested certain minimal dietary requirements necessary during pregnancy and also during the period of lactation. In the opinion of the Board, there was already adequate experimental evidence to indicate the probable daily requirement of calories, protein, and such inorganic ions as calcium, iron, copper, and iodine. It was also possible to formulate recommendations for the daily quantities of the fat-soluble vitamins, A and D, needed, as well as for two members of the B complex, namely, thiamin (B1) and riboflavin (B2 or G). Figures for the amount of vitamin C required were also included. While it was recognized that other inorganic salts and a number of vitamins listed as members of the B complex are also essential in an adequate diet, it was considered that our present information is inadequate to hazard a guess as to the amount required. While it is generally recognized by students of nutrition that, at best, the quantities of nutrients postulated by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council are tentative, this table has served as a most useful yardstick in the formulation of diets of high quality. The question of importance in the topic under dis-"

In animals receiving a normal protein intake of 20-per cent or 41-per cent casein, methionine supplements did not decrease the degree of hepatic damage produced by carbon tetrachloride as judged by serum phosphatase values or bromsulphalein retention."

In this method, the respiratory gases of the subject are mixed, through a mouthpiece, with a known quantity of oxygen, and the lung volume is calculated by the equation: (1) Lung Volume (Respiratory Volume) ="

Among the various techniques available, preference has recently been given to microfilm as the quickest and cheapest method in all cases where one copy or a small number of copies are required. Another application of the micro-copying technique, the micro-card, is in preparation. It will be an addition, not an alternative, and does not affect the issues discussed here, since for the purpose of this article the relative merits of individual techniques are of secondary importance. However, we may expect to hear more of the micro-card in the near future."

Dr. C. D. Darlington, president of the Genetical Society, in welcoming the foreign visitors, said that after the First World War it had taken nine years to arrange an international gathering. On this occasion it had been possible in nine weeks. For this they were indebted to the help of the British Council, the French Scientific Mission, and the happy coincidence of Prof. Muller's Pilgrim Trust Lecture to the Royal Society."
