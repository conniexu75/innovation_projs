Na+ absorption is regulated in part by mechanisms that control the expression of ENaC at the apical cell surface. Nedd4 family members (e.g. Nedd4, Nedd4-2) bind to the channel and decrease its surface expression by catalyzing its ubiquitination and degradation. Conversely, serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK), a downstream mediator of aldosterone, increases the expression of ENaC at the cell surface. Here we show that SGK and human Nedd4-2 (hNedd4-2) converge in a common pathway to regulate epithelial Na+ absorption. Consistent with this model, we found that SGK bound to hNedd4-2 and hNedd4. A PY motif in SGK mediated the interaction and was required for SGK to stimulate ENaC. SGK phosphorylated hNedd4-2 (but not hNedd4), altering hNedd4-2 function; phosphorylation reduced the binding of hNedd4-2 to αENaC, and hence, the hNedd4-2-mediated inhibition of Na+ absorption. These data suggest that SGK regulates epithelial Na+ absorption in part by modulating the function of hNedd4-2.

Science. 1996; 272: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of ENaC is critical for the maintenance of Na+ homeostasis and for blood pressure control. In the kidney collecting duct, Na+ absorption must vary over a wide range in response to conditions of Na+depletion or Na+ excess. This occurs in large part by mechanisms that modulate the expression of ENaC at the apical cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 6Snyder P.M. Endocr. Rev. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). For example, the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin protein-ligases (including Nedd4 and Nedd4-2) reduce ENaC surface expression (7Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol.

This interaction facilitates the ubiquitination of ENaC, catalyzed by a ubiquitin ligase domain at the C terminus of Nedd4 family members (7Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B.

Liddle's syndrome is caused by defects in this regulatory pathway; mutations in the ENaC PY motifs disrupt their interaction with Nedd4 family members, resulting in increased expression of ENaC at the cell surface, and hence, excessive Na+ absorption (10Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 13Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Thus, the Nedd4 family of proteins is critically important in reducing Na+absorption. Conversely, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone pathway increases renal Na+ absorption, in part by increasing the expression of ENaC at the cell surface (15Masilamani S. Kim G.H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R19-R23Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). This pathway plays a key role in responding to Na+ depletion and hypovolemia. Moreover, disruption of this pathway underlies several acquired and genetic disorders of blood pressure control, including primary aldosteronism and glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (5Lifton R.P. Science. 1996; 272: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). An important downstream mediator of aldosterone is serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK), (16Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Verrey F. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2514-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 17Naray-Fejes-Toth A.

SGK transcription is induced by aldosterone over a very rapid time course (30–60 min) (16Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Verrey F. Pearce D. Proc.

Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been proposed that SGK integrates a variety of signals that modulate renal Na+ absorption (19Wang J. Barbry P. Maiyar A.C. Rozansky D.J. Bhargava A. Leong M. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F303-F313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SGK increases the expression of ENaC at the cell surface (20Alvarez de la Rosa D. Zhang P. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Fejes-Toth G. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37834-37839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), but little is known about the mechanisms involved. Previous work reported that SGK phosphorylates Ser/Thr residues within the sequence RXRXXS/T (18Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 21Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, ENaC subunits are not phosphorylated by SGK (19Wang J. Barbry P. Maiyar A.C. Rozansky D.J. Bhargava A. Leong M. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F303-F313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems likely that SGK phosphorylates one or more proteins involved in controlling ENaC surface expression, although such SGK substrates have not yet been identified. Two observations suggest the possibility that the Nedd4 family and SGK might converge in a common pathway to regulate ENaC surface expression. First, SGK contains a PY motif (see Fig. 1A), suggesting that it might bind directly to WW domains in Nedd4 or Nedd4-2. Second, Nedd4-2 (but not hNedd4) contains three sequences that fit the consensus for phosphorylation by SGK, suggesting it might be a SGK substrate. The goal of this work was to test the hypothesis that SGK modulates ENaC surface expression in part through the phosphorylation of Nedd4-2. hNedd4 was cloned as described previously (12Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. McDonald F.J. Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28321-28326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). hNedd4-2 and human SGK were cloned by PCR of cDNA reverse transcribed from kidney poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH). Mutations were created using QuikChange Kit (Stratagene) and each cDNA was sequenced in the University of Iowa DNA Sequencing Core. Human α-, β-, and γENaC in pMT3 or pcDNA3 were cloned as described previously (4McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PY motifs of each subunit were mutated to PLP motifs (P7LP6) to disrupt binding to the hNedd4-2 WW domains. A FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was introduced at the C terminus of SGK to allow immunodetection. This epitope did not alter ENaC stimulation by SGK. cDNA encoding wild-type or mutant (Y298A or K127M) SGK or GFP (negative control) was expressed in COS-7 cells by electroporation, as described previously (13Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed and protein solubilized in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors (0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml aprotonin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). SGK was immunoprecipitated from 100 μl of lysate (1 μg/μl total protein) with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Eastman Kodak Co.) and protein A beads (Pierce). hNedd4-2 and hNedd4 (20 μl) were generated and [35S]methionine-labeled by in vitrotranscription and translation (TNT kit, Promega) then incubated with immunoprecipitated SGK or SGKY298A (or GFP) for 16 h. The beads were washed three times with TBS/1% Triton X-100, separated by SDS-PAGE, and imaged by fluorography. To detect total SGK, SGKY298A, or SGKK127M, 30 μg of lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked overnight with 5% dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The membrane was incubated for 2 h with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:1000), 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse IgG (1:50,000, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and imaged by chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). FRT cells were grown on permeable filter supports as described (22Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). One day after seeding, cells were cotransfected with α-, β-, and γENaC (0.07 μg each) and hNedd4-2, SGK, or GFP as a negative control (0.02–0.8 μg using TFX 50 (22)). The total DNA was held constant by varying the ratio of hNedd4-2 or SGK to GFP. Expression of GFP did not alter ENaC Na+ currents. Na+ transport was measured 2–3 days after transfection in modified Ussing chambers (Warner Instrument Corporation). The apical and basolateral surfaces were bathed in 135 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm K2HPO4, 0.6 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm dextrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 37 °C and bubbled with O2. Amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current was determined as the difference in current with and without amiloride (10 μm) in the apical bathing solution. cDNAs encoding hNedd4-2, hNedd4, or GFP (negative control) were expressed in COS-7 cells, solubilized in TBS containing 1% Triton X-100, and 250 μg of the lysates were immunoprecipitated with sheep anti-WW1 (hNedd4-2 and GFP) or sheep anti-WW2 (hNedd4) (1:100) (12Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. McDonald F.J. Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28321-28326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated protein was suspended in 15 mmMgCl2, 100 μm ATP, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na+ orthovanadate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 2 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (Sigma), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The samples were incubated with or without activated SGK (25 ng of SGK1 Δ1–60, S422D, Upstate Biotechnology) for 60 min at 30 °C. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and proteins detected by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. To detect total hNedd4-2 and hNedd4 protein, COS-7 cells were labeled for 1 h with [35S]methionine, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated as described above. hNedd4-2, hNedd4, or GFP expressed in COS-7 cells were immunoprecipitated, incubated with or without activated SGK (1 mm cold ATP substituted for [γ-32P]ATP), and incubated for 16 h with 20 μl of αENaC (transcribed, translated, and [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro). The beads were washed three times with TBS 1% Triton X-100, separated by SDS-PAGE, and imaged by fluorography. The PY motif (PPXY) is a sequence that mediates protein interactions through its binding to type I WW domains (23Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17284-17289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). SGK contains a sequence that fits the PY motif consensus (PPFY, amino acids 295–298, Fig. 1A). Members of the Nedd4 family contain multiple WW domains, which bind to PY motifs in ENaC. We tested the hypothesis that their WW domains might also bind to SGK. SGK (containing a FLAG epitope at the C terminus) was expressed in COS-7 cells. We detected SGK protein by Western blot (using anti-FLAG M2 antibody) in cells expressing SGK, but not in cells expressing GFP (Fig. 1B). To test for interactions, we incubated immunoprecipitated SGK with hNedd4-2 or hNedd4 (generated and [35S]methionine-labeled by in vitrotranslation). Both hNedd4-2 and hNedd4 bound to SGK, but not to immunoprecipitated protein from cells expressing GFP (Fig.1C). The PY motif of SGK mediated these interactions; mutation of a critical residue within the motif (Y298A) abolished SGK binding to hNedd4-2 and hNedd4 (Fig. 1C). This did not result from decreased protein production; the mutant and wild-type constructs generated similar amounts of SGK protein (Fig.1B). To investigate the functional role of this interaction, we asked whether the SGK PY motif was required to stimulate ENaC. Expression of α-, β-, and γENaC in FRT epithelial cells generated transepithelial short-circuit Na+ currents that were blocked by amiloride (22Snyder P.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Coexpression of ENaC with SGK increased Na+ current 2.7-fold (compared with ENaC expressed with GFP) (Fig. 1D). In contrast, SGKY298A did not stimulate ENaC (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the SGK PY motif is required for stimulation. We tested whether SGK kinase activity is required for it to stimulate ENaC in epithelia. In a previous study, mutation of a residue in the ATP binding site (SGKK127M) abolished the ability of SGK to phosphorylate a peptide substrate (18Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). We found that this mutation prevented SGK from stimulating ENaC expressed in FRT cells (Fig. 1D), but it did not alter levels of SGK protein (Fig. 1E). This suggests that SGK stimulates ENaC by phosphorylating one or more substrates. SGK phosphorylates serine or threonine residues in the context of the sequence RXRXXS/T (18Park J. Leong M.L. Buse P. Maiyar A.C. Firestone G.L. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3024-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 21Kobayashi T. Deak M. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Interestingly, hNedd4-2 contains three sequences that fit this consensus (Ser221, Thr246, and Ser327), but they are not conserved in hNedd4 (Fig.2A). We therefore tested the hypothesis that hNedd4-2 is a substrate for SGK phosphorylation. hNedd4-2, hNedd4, or GFP (negative control) were expressed in COS-7 cells, immunoprecipitated, and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP with or without an activated form of SGK (Δ1–60, S422D). We found that SGK phosphorylated hNedd4-2 but not hNedd4 (Fig. 2B). As a control for expression, we labeled cells with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the WW domains. Bands of the appropriate size were detected in cells transfected with hNedd4-2 and hNedd4, but not in cells transfected with GFP (Fig. 2C). We tested the hypothesis that phosphorylation alters hNedd4-2 function. ENaC was coexpressed with SGK or GFP (negative control) in FRT cells, along with increasing amounts of hNedd4-2 cDNA. When ENaC was expressed with GFP, hNedd4-2 decreased Na+ current in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3A). In contrast, hNedd4-2 reduced current to a lesser extent when expressed with SGK (Fig.3A). However, a kinase inactive mutant (SGKK127M) did not decrease inhibition (Fig.3A), suggesting that phosphorylation was required. Thus, SGK-mediated phosphorylation modulates hNedd4-2 function, decreasing its ability to inhibit ENaC. For hNedd4-2 and hNedd4 to inhibit Na+ current, their WW domains must bind to PY motifs in ENaC (7Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SGK consensus sites are located between the WW domains of hNedd4-2, suggesting that phosphorylation might alter its binding to ENaC. To test this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated hNedd4-2 or hNedd4 from COS-7 cells, followed by incubation with one of the ENaC subunits (αENaC, translated in vitro and labeled with [35S]methionine). We chose to use the α subunit, since previous work suggested that the three ENaC subunits are equivalent in their binding to WW domains (9Kamynina E. Debonneville C. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Staub O. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 204-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Farr T.J. Coddington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). αENaC bound to hNedd4-2 and hNedd4, but not to immunoprecipitated lysates from cells expressing GFP (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of hNedd4-2 by SGK decreased the binding of hNedd4-2 to αENaC (Fig. 3B). In contrast, SGK caused minimal change in the binding of hNedd4 to αENaC (Fig.3B), consistent with our finding that SGK did not phosphorylate hNedd4. The data suggest that SGK might increase Na+ current in part by decreasing the binding of hNedd4-2 to ENaC. Such a mechanism should therefore be disrupted by mutation of the ENaC PY motifs, which are required for this interaction. To test this hypothesis, we expressed ENaC (wild-type or PY motif mutations) with SGK (or GFP as negative control) in FRT cells and measured amiloride-sensitive short-circuit Na+ currents. SGK increased Na+current in cells expressing wild-type ENaC (167%) but not when the PY motifs were mutated in α-, β-, and γENaC (Fig. 3C). Thus, in epithelial cells, stimulation by SGK was dependent on the PY motifs of ENaC. The regulation of ENaC is critically important to maintain Na+ homeostasis. Disruption of this regulation causes genetic and acquired forms of hypertension and hypotension (5Lifton R.P. Science. 1996; 272: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Two important regulators of ENaC are aldosterone and its downstream mediator SGK, and the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin protein ligases, which modulate ENaC surface expression in a reciprocal manner. Our data suggest that these two pathways intersect, regulating ENaC in part through a common pathway. The data support a model in which SGK regulates Na+absorption in part by modulating the inhibition of ENaC by hNedd4-2 (Fig. 4). Under basal conditions (low aldosterone), hNedd4-2 is unphosphorylated and represses epithelial Na+ transport; its WW domains bind to ENaC PY motifs, resulting in ubiquitination, endocytosis, and degradation of the channel (Fig. 4, left panel). As a result, hNedd4-2 decreases Na+ current by reducing the expression of ENaC at the cell surface. In response to salt deprivation or in pathological states, aldosterone releases this repression of Na+absorption. Aldosterone stimulates the transcription of SGK (16Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Verrey F. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2514-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 17Naray-Fejes-Toth A.

The binding of SGK to hNedd4-2 appears to be essential, since mutation of the SGK PY motif prevented it from stimulating ENaC. Phosphorylation of hNedd4-2 reduces its binding to ENaC, resulting in increased ENaC at the cell surface, and hence, increased Na+ absorption. How might phosphorylation alter the binding of hNedd4-2 to ENaC? Although we do not yet have direct evidence to support a mechanism, it is interesting to note that the potential phosphorylation sites are located in segments between WW domains. For example, Ser221and Thr246 are located between WW domains 1 and 2, and Ser327 is located between WW domains 2 and 3 (Fig.2A). Perhaps phosphorylation induces a conformational change in hNedd4-2, altering the accessibility of the WW domains to bind ENaC. Interestingly, GenBankTM contains at least three different hNedd4-2 splice forms, differing in the number of potential SGK phosphorylation sites. The splice form we studied (Nedd4La, also known as Nedd18) corresponds most closely to mouse Nedd4-2 and has three potential phosphorylation sites. A second form, KIAA0439, lacks a 20-amino acid segment between WW domains 1 and 2, which deletes one of the SGK sites (Thr246). A third variant, DKFZp234p2422, lacks the second and third SGK sites, as well as WW domain 2. Importantly, each splice form appears to be expressed in collecting duct epithelia, 2C. P. Thomas, personal communication. and all three inhibit ENaC (Fig. 3 and Ref. 25Kamynina E. Tauxe C. Staub O. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 281: F469-F477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it seems possible that the splice forms could be differentially phosphorylated, and thus, differentially regulated by SGK. Alternatively, perhaps only the site present in all three forms is phosphorylated (Ser221). What is the function of the interaction between SGK and hNedd4-2? A recurring theme is that many signaling molecules assemble into complexes to target their activity to specific substrates. Interactions between signaling molecules can occur through adapter proteins, such as protein kinase A anchoring proteins (26Diviani D. Scott J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions can also be direct; phosphorylation of theN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor by calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is mediated by a direct interaction (27Leonard A.S. Lim I.A. Hemsworth D.E. Horne M.C. Hell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3239-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Thus, perhaps SGK binding targets its kinase activity to hNedd4-2. Binding can also be required to activate a kinase; N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor binding activates calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, a mechanism thought to be important for learning and memory (28De Bayer K.U. Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Similarly, SGK might be activated through its binding to hNedd4-2. In addition to hNedd4-2, the function of ENaC may also be regulated by other ubiquitin protein-ligases. Nedd4 is expressed in the renal collecting duct (29Staub O. Yeger H. Plant P.J. Kim H. Ernst S.A. Rotin D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1871-C1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibits ENaC (7Goulet C.C. Volk K.A. Adams C.M. Prince L.S. Stokes J.B. Snyder P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30012-30017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 8Abriel H. Loffing J. Rebhun J.F. Pratt J.H. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rotin D. Staub O. J. Clin.

A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, SGK consensus phosphorylation sites are not present in Nedd4, suggesting that SGK does not modulate the activity of this ubiquitin protein-ligase. Consistent with such a hypothesis, we found that SGK did not phosphorylate hNedd4 or alter its binding to αENaC. This raises several possibilities. Perhaps Nedd4 inhibits ENaC in a constitutive manner. More likely, the inhibition of ENaC by Nedd4 might be regulated by different mechanisms. In this regard, it has been reported that cytosolic Ca2+ alters the localization of Nedd4, resulting in its translocation to the cell surface (31Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Nedd4 might be phosphorylated by a different kinase or might be transcriptionally regulated. Finally, it is possible that Nedd4 does not regulate Na+ transport in epithelia, despite its ability to inhibit ENaC expressed in heterologous cells. Could SGK modulate ENaC function by additional mechanisms? Several observations raise this possibility. For example, it is possible that the SGK PY motif competes with ENaC for binding to the WW domains of hNedd4-2 (or other ubiquitin protein-ligases). In this way, SGK could increase Na+ current by directly blocking the binding of hNedd4-2 to ENaC. However, competition for hNedd4-2 binding does not appear to be the sole mechanism, since SGK kinase activity was also required for ENaC stimulation and for SGK to modulate hNedd4-2 function. In addition, SGK might stimulate ENaC through mechanisms independent of hNedd4-2. In support of this possibility, inXenopus oocytes, mutation of the ENaC PY motifs did not prevent SGK from increasing Na+ current (20Alvarez de la Rosa D. Zhang P. Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Fejes-Toth G. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37834-37839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), in contrast to our data in epithelia. It was also reported that SGK could bind directly to the C terminus of α- and βENaC (19Wang J. Barbry P. Maiyar A.C. Rozansky D.J. Bhargava A. Leong M. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F303-F313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, SGK did not phosphorylate ENaC, and the functional role and the sequences that mediate this interaction are not yet known. Our data suggest that aldosterone, SGK, and hNedd4-2 converge into a common pathway to regulate Na+ absorption. Within this pathway, hNedd4-2 and related members of the Nedd4 family might form a central point of convergence to regulate ENaC surface expression, and hence, to maintain Na+ homeostasis.

In the current study, the molecular mechanism for this suppressive effect was investigated with luciferase reporter gene assays using the SREBP-1c promoter in HEK293 cells. Consistent with previous data, the addition of PUFAs to the medium in the assays robustly inhibited the SREBP-1c promoter activity. Deletion and mutation of the two liver X receptor (LXR)-responsive elements (LXREs) in the SREBP-1c promoter region eliminated this suppressive effect, indicating that both LXREs are important PUFA-suppressive elements. The luciferase activities of both SREBP-1c promoter and LXRE enhancer constructs induced by co-expression of LXRα or -β were strongly suppressed by the addition of various PUFAs (arachidonic acid > eicosapentaenoic acid > docosahexaenoic acid > linoleic acid), whereas saturated or mono-unsaturated fatty acids had minimal effects. Gel shift mobility and ligand binding domain activation assays demonstrated that PUFA suppression of SREBP-1c expression is mediated through its competition with LXR ligand in the activation of the ligand binding domain of LXR, thereby inhibiting binding of LXR/retinoid X receptor heterodimer to the LXREs in the SREBP-1c promoter. These data suggest that PUFAs could be deeply involved in nutritional regulation of cellular fatty acid levels by inhibiting an LXR-SREBP-1c system crucial for lipogenesis.

The labeled probes (3,000–10,000 cpm) were incubated with nuclear receptor lysates (1–1.5 μl) in a mixture (20 μl) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 8.5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mg/ml nonfat milk for 30 min on ice. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4.6% polyacrylamide gel at 140 V for 1 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to BAS2000 with BAStation software (Fuji Photo Film). To investigate the molecular mechanism by which dietary PUFAs decrease hepatic SREBP-1c expression, we established mouse SREBP-1c promoter luciferase reporter gene assays in HepG2 and HEK293 cells. As an initial study, we estimated the effect of supplementation of EPA to the medium (100 μm) on mouse SREBP-1c promoter (2.6-kb 5′-flanking region) activity in HepG2 cells. Cells were co-transfected with LXRα or -β. These conditions have been shown to activate SREBP-1c promoter through LXREs (23Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T.

Consistent with previous in vivo observations that PUFA suppresses SREBP-1c expression (14Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A. Amemiya-Kudo M. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Shionoiri F. Ohashi K. Osuga J.

This suppressive effect of EPA was similarly observed in HEK293 cells (Fig.1B). After these studies, effects of various PUFAs were tested in HEK293 cells co-transfected with LXRα. As shown in Fig.2, SREBP-1c promoter activity was reduced by the addition of each PUFA (AA > EPA > DHA > LA). In contrast, saturated fatty acid (SA) had no effect, and the result of the addition of OA was minimal. These data indicate that SREBP-1c promoter assays can reflect PUFA suppression of SREBP-1c expression reported by us and others (14Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A. Amemiya-Kudo M. Okazaki H. Tamura Y.

Various PUFAs (100 μm) dissolved in ethanol or ethanol only (EtOH) as a control were added to the cells after transfection in medium with 10% fetal bovine serum 24 h prior to the assay.

As shown in Fig.3, the lack of LXREa, the upstream LXRE site of the two LXREs in the SREBP-1c promoter, caused a partial decrease in the inhibitory effect of EPA, and deletion of both LXREa and -b abolished the effect completely. These data suggest that the region containing the two LXREs are the PUFA-responsive elements of the SREBP-1c promoter. To explore this more precisely, we constructed an enhancer luciferase construct containing the two LXREs (pLXRE-Luc). As shown in Fig. 4, pLXRE-Luc was activated by overexpression of either LXRα or -β. EPA suppression was observed in both LXRα- and LXRβ-activated LXRE-Luc activities. Introduction of a mutation in either LXREa or LXREb caused a partial impairment in this EPA inhibitory effect. Disruption of both elements abolished the EPA suppression completely. Another SREBP-1c promoter luciferase reporter (pBP1c90-Luc) containing an SRE, but no LXREs, was activated by co-expression of nuclear SREBP-1c. No EPA inhibition was observed in this construct, even when SREBP-1c was overexpressed. These data confirm that both LXREs are responsible for PUFA suppression of the SREBP-1c promoter.Figure 4Inhibitory effect of polyunsaturated fatty acid on SREBP-1c promoter activity is mediated by the LXRE complex in the SREBP-1c promoter.A, the LXRE complex containing two LXREs (LXREa and -b) was located at −249 to −148 bp in the SREBP-1c promoter as described previously (23Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. Mol. Cell.

B, the LXRE complex in the SREBP-1c promoter was fused to a luciferase reporter plasmid, which contained an SV40 promoter (pGL2 promoter vector). This enhancer construct (pLXRE-Luc) or the indicated mutant construct was co-transfected into HEK293 cells with pCMV-LXRα, -β, or an empty vector, CMV-7 as a control, and pSV-βgal as a reference plasmid.C, pBP1c90b-Luc, which contained an SRE complex but no LXRE complex, was co-transfected into HEK293 cells with pCMV-SREBP-1c or an empty vector (CMV-7) as a control and pSV-βgal as a reference plasmid. Either EPA (100 μm) or ethanol (EtOH) as a control was added to the cells after transfection in medium with 10% fetal bovine serum 24 h before the assay.

As shown in Fig.5, PUFA, AA, EPA, DHA, and LA all suppressed pLXRE-Luc in a dose-dependent manner. OA showed a weak suppression, whereas SA did not have any effect. These data are consistent with results from the original 2.6-kb SREBP-1c construct and indicate that two LXREs are responsible for PUFA suppression. PUFA are known to be PPAR ligands (33Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 34Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S.

However, previous in vivo observations on PUFA inhibition of SREBP-1c suggest that the effect was PPAR-independent (35Mater M.K. Thelen A.P. Pan D.A. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32725-32732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The present study indicates that the element responsible for PUFA suppression is the LXREs. To rule out the possibility that PUFA inhibition of pLXRE-Luc is mediated through PPARα, we used synthetic PPAR ligands such fenofibric acid and Wy-14,643 for PPARα and pioglitazone for PPARγ (Fig.6). In contrast to EPA, these pharmacological PPAR agonists did not suppress pLXRE-luc, whereas these ligands did activate their respective target pPPRE-luc constructs. These data indicate that PPAR activation is not involved in PUFA inhibition of LXRE and SREBP-1c. To further investigate the molecular mechanism by which PUFAs suppress LXREs in the SREBP-1c promoter, gel shift mobility assays were performed. In vitro translated LXRα and RXR recombinant proteins were used to confirm binding of LXRα/RXR heterodimer to the LXREb probe as estimated by the shifted band. Fig.7A shows that the shifted signal was enhanced by the direct addition of T0901713, an artificial LXR ligand, in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating ligand activation of LXR binding to LXRE. The addition of PUFA inhibited the shifted bind, whereas SA and OA had a minimal effect. The rank order of the potency of the inhibitory effect of each fatty acid was similar to that observed in the luciferase assays. The inhibitory effect of AA was the strongest (Fig. 7B). Fig. 7Cshows the competition between AA and LXR ligand. The signal from the LXR/RXR·LXRE complex was inhibited by the addition of AA in a dose-dependent manner, and further addition of T0901713 dose-dependently blocked the inhibitory effect of AA. These results strongly suggest that inhibition of LXR/RXR binding to LXRE by PUFA was mediated through antagonizing the ligand effect on the LBD of LXR. For comparison, effects of PUFA on shifts of a PPRE probe by PPARα and RXR proteins were also tested (Fig. 7D). PPARα/RXR binding to PPRE was not affected by SA but was enhanced by OA, PUFA, and PPAR ligands, demonstrating that blocking the effects of PUFA on LXR/RXR-LXRE binding are not due to nonspecific inhibition of the assays by the fatty acid moiety. The data suggest that PUFA directly inhibits LXR/RXR binding to LXRE or LXR/RXR heterodimers. To clarify the molecular mechanism by which PUFA inhibits LXR/RXR binding to LXRE, LBD activation assays of LXRα were performed. In these assays, an expression plasmid of the LBD of LXRα fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain was co-transfected with a luciferase reporter containing Gal4 binding sites to estimate the specific ligand binding of the samples to LBD of LXRα. The addition of 22RHC, a well known LXR ligand, increased the Gal4 activity. As shown in Fig. 8, the addition of each PUFA showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the LBD activation in a very similar pattern to the effects observed in the LXRE luciferase assay under 22RHC-activated conditions, suggesting that PUFA inhibits LXR ligand binding to LXR/RXR. Subsequently, the PUFA inhibitory effect on SREBP-1c promoter activity was re-estimated by competition between EPA and 22RHC in the presence of an abundant amount of LXRα by co-transfection (0.1 μg DNA). The addition of 22RHC without EPA resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the luciferase activity (Fig.9, left). As shown in Fig. 9,right, in the presence of 10 and 30 μm of 22RHC, the percent inhibition curve of LXRE-LBD binding activity by EPA was shifted to the right, suggesting a competition between 22RHC and EPA in the activation of LXR. We also investigated the possibility that PUFA inhibition of LXR/RXR binding to LXRE might be mediated through an interaction of PUFA to RXR. Fig. 10shows that overexpression of RXR by co-transfection minimally changed LXRE-enhancer luciferase activity, suggesting that RXR is not a limiting factor for LXR/RXR binding to LXRE in this system. If PUFA could interact with RXR to modify LXR/RXR binding to LXRE, overexpression of RXR should absorb and repress this PUFA effect on LXR/RXR. However, inhibitory effects of PUFA on LXRE-enhancer activity (Fig. 10) and the 2.6-kb SREBP-1c promoter activity (data not shown) were not affected by RXR overexpression in the RXR-co-transfected cells. The addition of 9CRA, an RXR ligand, increased the effect of LXR/RXR but did not markedly affect the inhibitory efficiency of PUFA. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of PUFA may be independent of the RXR portion of the LXR/RXR heterodimer. In the current study, we located PUFA suppressive elements in the mouse SREBP-1c promoter. The responsible elements correspond to two LXREs that were previously identified as LXR/RXR activation sites (23Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Further luciferase studies, gel shift assays, and LBD activation assays demonstrated that PUFAs suppress SREBP-1c expression through interacting with the LBD of LXR and inhibiting LXR/RXR binding to the LXREs crucial for SREBP-1c expression as schematized in Fig.11. The order of inhibitory magnitude of each long chain fatty acid on SREBP-1c expression is as follows: AA > EPA > DHA > LA ≫ OA > SA = 0. This order was essentially consistent among the luciferase assays with the 2.6-kb SREBP-1c promoter and LXRE-enhancer as well as in gel shift and LBD activation assays. Furthermore, the same order of long chain fatty acid effects on SREBP-1c suppression has been shown in diet studies with mice. 2N. Yahagi, unpublished data. Furthermore, these data suggest that the inhibitory effect of PUFA is primarily attributed to their blocking effect on the LBD of LXR. The degree of unsaturation of the fatty acids might be a factor for this inhibitory effect, but whether they are n-3 or n-6 appears to be irrelevant. The LXR/RXR complex has been established as a nuclear receptor for oxysterols, controlling regulation of excess cellular cholesterol (24Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G.

It is interesting to speculate that oxidative modification of PUFA during incubation might make them eligible to interact with LXR. However, the addition of several kinds of antioxidants such as probucol and vitamin E did not change the ability of PUFA to inhibit SREBP-1c activation (data not shown). Finally, even after direct addition of PUFA to the incubation mixture for gel shift assays, PUFA still showed inhibitory effects on LXR/RXR binding to LXRE, strongly suggesting a direct action of PUFA. The current study demonstrates that PUFA can be an antagonist for LXR/RXR. It seems that PUFA binds to the LBD of LXRs in a fashion that is competitive with an endogenous LXR ligand, thereby repressing LXR/RXR transactivity. During the process of preparing this manuscript, an antagonizing effect of PUFA in competition with an LXR pharmacological ligand, as measured by SREBP-1c expression in RNA protection and LXR coactivator recruitment assays in rat hepatoma cells, was reported (21Ou J. Tu H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The conclusion was compatible with our present data. Further studies on LXR ligands in relation to oxysterols and PUFA are needed. Structure analysis on ligand binding and DNA binding domains of LXR in the presence of LXR ligands and LXRE should assist in understanding the complex nature of this system. Our new finding on PUFA inhibition of LXR-SREBP-1c brings up an intriguing speculation for a mechanism of energy regulation as depicted in Fig. 11. Previous work by our laboratory (23Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N. Hasty A.H. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. Mol. Cell.

Meanwhile, PUFAs can function as ligands for PPARα (33Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar, 34Kliewer S.A.

A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar), another transcription factor that plays a crucial role for fatty acid oxidation in an energy-depleted state such as fasting (37Kersten S.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). In a fasted state, PUFAs can be released from adipose tissue by lipolysis. Taken up by the liver, PUFAs can bind to and activate PPARα to induce β-oxidation of other saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids. At the same time, PUFA antagonize LXR/RXR, leading to suppression of SREBP-1c and minimizing lipogenesis. Therefore, PUFA might have efficient regulatory roles for adaptic control of two extreme nutritional states by having reciprocal effects on LXR-SREBP-1c and PPARα (Fig. 11). In addition, post-transcriptional regulation of the SREBP-1c gene by PUFA has been also proposed (15Xu J. Nakamura M.T. Cho H.P. Clarke S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23577-23583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 20Xu J. Teran-Garcia M. Park J.H. Nakamura M.T. Clarke S.D. J. Biol.

Further studies are needed to clarify the relative roles of transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and cleavage regulation of SREBP-1c by PUFAin vivo. The current data suggest that PUFAs could be intricately involved in nutritional regulation by affecting the LXR-SREBP-1c system that is crucial for lipogenesis as well as having a well established role as ligands for PPARα. This might open up a new aspect of nutritional regulation involving essential fatty acids as well as energy fuels. We thank A. H. Hasty for critical reading of the manuscript."

The functions of these enzymes remain to be determined, but the fact that they have distinct tissue distribution profiles supports the proposal that they have distinct functions. secreted phospholipase A2 bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein colony forming units Human group IIA sPLA2 kills Gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococci and streptococci (12Weinrauch Y.

Group IIA sPLA2 purified from the mouse intestine is also able to kill bothE. coli and Salmonella subspecies (14Harwig S.S. Tan L., Qu, X.D. Cho Y. Eisenhauer P.B. Lehrer R.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 603-610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Enzymatic activity (phospholipolysis) is required for the bactericidal activity of mammalian group IIA sPLA2 against Gram-positive (12Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Madsen L.M. Foreman A. Weiss J. J. Clin.

It has been suggested that bacterial envelope sites engaged in cell growth may represent preferential sites for the action of group IIA sPLA2 against Gram-positive bacteria (17Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Phospholipid hydrolysis and bacterial killing were more effective when sublethal doses of β-lactam antibiotics were added to the bacterial cultures (17Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Moreover, bacteria are more resistant against the bactericidal action of group IIA sPLA2 in the stationary phase than in the logarithmic (growth) phase, suggesting that these microorganisms are more susceptible to sPLA2 when they are dividing (17Foreman-Wykert A.K. Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Overall, bacterial cell wall components outside of the phospholipid membrane seem to provide a barrier for the access of sPLA2s to the phospholipid membrane surface. The bactericidal action of group IIA sPLA2 against Gram-negative bacteria is more complex than its action against Gram-positive bacteria. Group IIA sPLA2 is bactericidal against E. coli by acting synergistically with the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), an antimicrobial protein produced by neutrophils (16Weiss J. Inada M. Elsbach P. Crowl R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26331-26337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Through its interaction with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, BPI perturbs the capsules of Gram-negative bacteria and enables phospholipolysis of the bacterial phospholipid membrane by group IIA sPLA2 (18Elsbach P. Uhl W. Nevalainen T.J. Büchler M.W. Phospholipase A2: Basic and Clinical Aspects in Inflammation. 24. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1997: 17-22Google Scholar). Group IIA sPLA2 enhances the action of complement components against E. coli and thereby increases the bacterial killing capacity of complement (19Madsen L.M. Inada M. Weiss J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2425-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that human group IIA sPLA2 (hGIIA) 2A comprehensive abbreviation system for the various mammalian sPLA2s is used. Each sPLA2 is abbreviated with a lowercase letter indicating the sPLA2 species (m and h for murine and human, respectively) followed by uppercase letters identifying the sPLA2 group (GIB, GIIA, GIIC, GIID, GIIE, GIIF, GV, GX, and GXII). has potent bactericidal properties raises the possibility that other mammalian sPLA2s are lethal to bacteria in vitro. Recent studies have shown that rat group V sPLA2 has bactericidal activity in vitro (20Grönroos J.O. Laine V.J. Janssen M.J. Egmond M.R. Nevalainen T.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4029-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have recently developed overexpression systems that provide fully native mammalian groups I, II, V, X, and XII sPLA2s, thus permitting the bactericidal properties of these enzymes to be explored. We have also carried out a systematic study of the role of surface cationic residues (Lys and Arg) of hGIIA in supporting the bactericidal activity of this enzyme. The hGIIA-N1A mutant of human group IIA sPLA2 (as well as all hGIIA-N1A mutants) was obtained by bacterial expression andin vitro refolding as described (21Othman R. Baker S., Li, Y. Worrall A.F.

All hGIIA-N1A mutants were prepared using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. The entire coding region of all mutant plasmids was sequenced. The sPLA2s mGIID, mGIIE, hGIIE, mGIIF, hGIIF, hGX, and hGXII were obtained by bacterial expression and in vitro refolding as described (10Gelb M.H. Valentin E. Ghomashchi F. Lazdunski M. Lambeau G.

All sPLA2s were judged to be >98% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis. The experimentally determined masses of all sPLA2s were determined by electrospray mass spectrometry, and observed values agreed with theoretical values to within 1 atomic mass unit in all cases, indicating that all disulfide bonds are fully formed. Specific activities of hGIIA and its charge reversal mutants on 1-palmitoyl-2-pyrenedecanoyl-phosphatidylmethanol vesicles were measured using the fluorimetric procedure (24Dudler T. Chen W.-Q. Wang S. Schneider T. Annand R.R. Dempcy R.O. Crameri R. Gmachl M. Suter M. Gelb M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1165: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The bactericidal effects of sPLA2s were tested against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), L. monocytogenes (RHD 1343), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) (provided by the Finnish National Public Health Institute, Turku) and B. subtilis (IS 230) (12Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Madsen L.M. Foreman A. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To test the bactericidal effects of sPLA2s, dilutions of 100, 10, and 1 μg/ml in sterile water were prepared for each recombinant sPLA2 enzyme. Because of the small amount of enzyme available, only 10 and 1 μg/ml dilutions were prepared for hGIIE, hGIIF, mGIB, mGIIF, and mGX sPLA2s. Because of poor solubility in distilled water, hGV and mGV sPLA2s were first dissolved in a mixture of 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in sterile water. The resulting solution contained 500 μg/ml sPLA2 and was diluted with sterile water to give the dilutions mentioned above. The assay of the bactericidal activity was performed as described previously (20Grönroos J.O. Laine V.J. Janssen M.J. Egmond M.R. Nevalainen T.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4029-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of bacterial suspension containing ∼5 × 105 bacteria in Hepes buffer (20 mmol/liter Hepes, 2.0 mmol/liter Ca2+, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) was added to 20 μl of sPLA2 suspension. A mixture of 20 μl of bacterial suspension and 20 μl of sterile saline served as a sPLA2 negative control. The resulting solutions thus contained 50, 5, 0.5, and 0 μg/ml sPLA2. The sPLA2 negative control for hGV and mGV contained the same amount of acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid as the 50 μg/ml sPLA2 solutions. The solutions were incubated with bacteria at 37 °C with shaking at 240 rpm. Samples were taken at 20, 60, and 120 min and plated on brain heart infusion agar and grown for 24 h to measure colony-forming units (CFU). The bactericidal tests were performed twice on each bacterium and enzyme, and the results are given as mean values of duplicate determinations. Studies of the bactericidal effect of hGIIA mutants on B. subtilus and S. aureus and release of [14C]oleic acid from [14C]oleic acid-labeled bacteria were carried out as described (12Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Madsen L.M. Foreman A. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Bacteria were incubated with sPLA2 for 90 min at 37 °C prior to the analysis of CFU and phospholipid hydrolysis. The bactericidal effects of recombinant human and murine sPLA2s toward two Gram-positive bacteria (L. monocytogenesand S. aureus) and against the Gram-negative bacteriumE. coli were tested by measuring the number of CFU after incubating live bacteria with various concentrations of sPLA2 for various times (see “Experimental Procedures” and the legends to Figs. 1and 2). Results are summarized in Figs. 1 and2.Figure 2In vitro bactericidal activity of human and murine sPLA2s. Details are the same as described in the legend for Fig. 1. A, mGIID; B, hGIIE;C, mGIIE; D, hGIIF; E, mGIIF. The results shown in the figure are means of two independent tests. The sPLA2 concentrations were as follows: × = 0 μg/ml sPLA2, ▪ = 0.5 μg/ml sPLA2, ♦ = 5 μg/ml sPLA2, ● = 50 μg/ml sPLA2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) hGIB (Fig. 1 A), mGIB (Fig. 1 B), hGIIF (Fig.2 D), and mGIIF (Fig. 2 E) displayed poor bactericidal activity against all three bacteria. Some of these sPLA2s displayed modest bactericidal activity only at the highest concentration of sPLA2 tested (50 μg/ml). For example, 50 μg/ml hGIB sPLA2 killed 70% of L. monocytogenes in 2 h but was ineffective against the other bacteria tested. Very effective Gram-positive bactericidal activity was observed for hGIIA, mGIIA, and mGIID (Fig. 1, C and D, and Fig. 2 A). Even at the lowest concentration tested (0.5 μg/ml), these enzymes killed over 99% of L. monocytogenesand S. aureus. All three sPLA2s showed poor bactericidal activity against E. coli. hGIID was not tested because of the difficulty in refolding this protein from inclusion bodies produced in E. coli. 3M. H. Gelb and G. Lambeau, unpublished observations. mGIIE, hGIIE, and mGIIC displayed intermediate potency as bactericidal agents against Gram-positive bacteria (Fig. 1 E and Fig. 2,B and C). All three displayed measurable bactericidal activity against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus at 5 μg/ml. mGIIE killed over 99% of L. monocytogenes and S. aureus at 50 μg/ml. hGIIE was not tested at this highest concentration because sufficient amounts were not available. Neither enzyme was bactericidal against E. coli. Both hGV (Fig. 3 A) and mGV (Fig. 3 B) were bactericidal against Gram-positive bacteria. At the concentration of 50 μg/ml, the enzymes killed 100% ofL. monocytogenes and 90% of S. aureus in 2 h. At the concentration of 5 μg/ml, hGV killed ∼70% of L. monocytogenes and 50% of S. aureus in 2 h. At a concentration of 5 μg/ml, mGV had no bactericidal effect againstS. aureus but killed 50% of L. monocytogenes. Neither enzyme was bactericidal against E. coli. At a concentration of 50 μg/ml, human hGX killed 99.9% of L. monocytogenes and 98% of S. aureus in 2 h (Fig.3 C). Because of the small amount of enzyme available, only concentrations of mGX up to 5 μg/ml mGX were tested (Fig.3 D). At this concentration, both human and murine enzymes showed similar bactericidal effects against Gram-positive bacteria. Neither enzyme was bactericidal against E. coli. hGXII sPLA2 was clearly bactericidal against all three bacteria tested when tested at a high concentration (Fig. 3 E). At a concentration of 50 μg/ml, the enzyme killed 99.9% of L. monocytogenes and S. aureus and 94% of E. coli in 2 h. mGXII was not available for testing, but its sequence is 94% identical to that of hGXII. Because hGIIA and mGIIA are the most potent bactericidal sPLA2s toward Gram-positive bacteria among the human and murine sPLA2s studied, we carried out a detailed structure/function analysis of the bactericidal properties of hGIIA using a panel of mutants. We hypothesized that the highly basic nature of hGIIA (calculated pI value of 9.3) allows it to penetrate the highly anionic cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria to gain access to the outer phospholipid membrane. hGIIA contains 22 lysine and arginine residues scattered over its entire surface. As noted previously, these cationic residues are spatially segregated into eight clusters containing 1–5 basic residues (22Koduri R.S. Baker S.F. Snitko Y. Han S.K. Cho W. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32142-32153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The largest cluster contains Lys-53, Arg-54, Lys-57, and Arg-58 located on the face of hGIIA away from the putative membrane binding surface (see Fig. 1 of Ref. 23Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F. Molini B. Wilton D.C. Gelb M.H. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14325-14333Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar for a structural depiction of these basic residues). Three charge reversal mutations were introduced into this cluster (K53E/R54E/R58E). The double- and triple-site mutants K38E/K116E, R7E/K10E/K16E, and K74E/K87E/R92E contain charge reversal in clusters that lie on the putative membrane binding surface of hGIIA. The double mutants K110E/K115E and K124E/R127D are in separate clusters that are close to the putative membrane binding surface. Some of these charge reversal cluster mutations were combined into the same protein (K53E/R54E/R58E/K124E/R127D and K38E/K110E/K115E/K116E), and some mutants were prepared that contain a smaller number of charge reversal mutations (R7E/K10E, K10E/K16E, R7E, K74E, K87E, R92E). As shown in Table I, the specific activity of wild type hGIIA and all charge reversal mutants are similar (52–133% of wild type) when measured with a fluorimetric assay using 1-palmitoyl-2-pyrenedecanoyl-phosphatidylmethanol vesicles. This indicates that all mutants were structurally intact and that all mutants bound well to anionic phosphatidylmethanol vesicles.Table IBactericidal and phospholipid hydrolysis properties of wild type and mutant hGIIA sPLA2shGIIA phospholipase A2Phosphatidyl-methanol vesicle hydrolysisCFU B. subtilisEC501-a106 bacteria/ml.Phospholipid hydrolysis B. subtilis1-b106, 107, 108 bacteria/ml.Phospholipid hydrolysisB. subtilisprotoplasts1-c107 bacteria/ml.CFU S. aureusEC501-a106 bacteria/ml.Phospholipid hydrolysis S. aureusautoclaved1-a106 bacteria/ml.% WT% WT% WT% WT% WT% WTWild type1001001-dValues of EC50 for killing of B. subtilis and S. aureus by wild type hGIIA sPLA2 are 5 and 250 ng/ml, respectively.100, 100, 1001001001-dValues of EC50 for killing of B. subtilis and S. aureus by wild type hGIIA sPLA2 are 5 and 250 ng/ml, respectively.100R92E1241820, 50, 1008001290K87E1092525, 50, 10080010100K74E1332023, 45, 9070010100R7E522015, 45, 100700490K110E/K115E11156, 12, 80150150K38E/K116E10332, 6, 15150140K10E/K16E10011.5, 3, 15700<0.140R7E/K10E1291.51.5, 5, 2020<0.130K124E/R127D6011, 5, 25100<0.190K53E/R54E/R58E751010, 20, 110900<0.190K74E/K87E/R92E116<0.1<0.1, 0.8, 10300<0.130R7E/K10E/K16E92<0.1<0.1, 1, 1030<0.15K38E/K110E/K115E/K116E70<0.1<0.1, <0.1, 3120<0.11K53E/R54E/R58E/K124E/R127D60<0.1<0.1, <0.1, 5200<0.10.81-a 106 bacteria/ml.1-b 106, 107, 108 bacteria/ml.1-c 107 bacteria/ml.1-d Values of EC50 for killing of B. subtilis and S. aureus by wild type hGIIA sPLA2 are 5 and 250 ng/ml, respectively. Open table in a new tab All of these mutant hGIIA proteins were tested for their bactericidal activity on Gram-positive bacteria and for their ability to release radiolabeled oleic acid from bacterial membranes. Fig.4 shows the B. subtilisbactericidal dose-response curves for wild type hGIIA and six charge reversal mutants. Table I lists the B. subtilis bactericidal activity of all mutants relative to that of wild type hGIIA. There is a dominant and general trend that bactericidal activity decreases as the amount of positive charge on hGIIA is decreased regardless of whether cationic residues on or not on the putative membrane binding site are mutated. A secondary effect is also apparent. Lysines and arginines on the putative membrane binding surface appear to be modestly more important for supporting bactericidal activity than are residues that are not on the membrane binding surface. For example, the double mutant R7E/K10E is less potent at killing B. subtilis than is the triple mutant K53E/R54E/R58E. It is significant that K53E/R54E/R58E is considerably less potent at killingB. subtilis than is wild type hGIIA despite the fact that these charge reversal mutations are on the opposite face of the enzyme from the membrane binding surface. Pig pancreatic sPLA2 displays no bactericidal activity (not shown) as reported previously (30Weiss J. Wright G. Bekkers A.C. van den Bergh C.J. Verheij H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4162-4167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Buckland A.G. Heeley E.L. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Table I lists the relative EC50 (concentrations eliciting 50% effect) values for the bactericidal activity of all of the charge reversal hGIIA mutants acting on the Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus. As reported previously (12Weinrauch Y. Elsbach P. Madsen L.M. Foreman A. Weiss J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 250-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), wild type hGIIA is about 50-fold less potent as a bactericidal agent against S. aureus than against B. subtilis (EC50values of 250 and 5 ng/ml toward S. aureus and B. subtilis, respectively). The trend for the charge reversal mutants is similar to that seen with B. subtilis, i.e.bactericidal activity falls as the number of lysine and arginine residues is mutated to anionic residues. Bactericidal potency onS. aureus is more sensitive to charge reversal mutagenesis than on B. subtilis (Table I). For example, even single site charge reversal mutants reduce bactericidal potency about 10-fold, and the triple mutant K53E/R54E/R58E displays no bactericidal activity onS. aureus when tested up to 1 μg/ml even though this hGIIA protein has a fully native membrane binding surface. The ability of the charge reversal mutants to liberate oleic acid from bacterial membrane phospholipids was also studied. Dose-response curves are shown in Fig. 5 for the action of hGIIA and six charge reversal mutants on B. subtilis, and Table I compares the fatty acid release by all mutants. Incubation of radiolabeled bacteria with increasing amounts of wild type hGIIA leads to a maximum release of about 60% of the total 14C incorporated in bacteria. This is close to the expected amount (∼50%) if only the phospholipids in the extracellular leaflet of the bilayered membrane (that which is accessible to sPLA2) become hydrolyzed. The ability of the hGIIA mutants to release oleic acid from membrane phospholipids correlates well with the relative bactericidal activity (compare Figs. 3 and 4 and the data in Table I). We hypothesized that the charge reversal mutants are less capable of hydrolyzing the membrane of intact B. subtilis because of poor penetration into the anionic cell wall. If so, the effect of charge reversal mutagenesis may be partially overcome by increasing the concentration of bacteria in the reaction mixture with hGIIA, which will drive the equilibrium between free and bacteria-bound sPLA2 in favor of the latter (mass action). As shown by the data in Table I, this is indeed the case. As the concentration of B. subtilisin the reaction mixture with hGIIA is increased from 106/ml to 108/ml, the ability of the charge reversal mutants to hydrolyze bacterial phospholipids is fully restored for the single site mutants and for the triple mutant K53E/R54E/R58E and is partially restored for the other multisite mutants. We also studied the ability of hGIIA and its charge reversal mutants to release oleic acid from membrane phospholipids of B. subtilis protoplasts, which contact an intact phospholipid membrane but lack a cell wall, and the results are summarized in TableI. With protoplasts, a dramatically different behavior is seen compared with intact bacteria in that all of the proteins showed very similar ability to hydrolyze membrane phospholipids. With 107bacteria/ml, the maximum span in relative efficiency of protoplast membrane phospholipid hydrolysis for wild type versus mutant hGIIA is 5-fold, which compares with the maximum span of >1,000-fold for the bactericidal activity of these proteins against 107/ml live B. subtilis (Table I). Note that some hGIIA mutants display a higher specific activity than wild type for the hydrolysis of protoplast phospholipids. For example, K53E/R54E/R58E is 9-fold more active than wild type hGIIA in this assay. When S. aureus was autoclaved to disrupt its cell wall and expose its membrane phospholipids, all mutants were considerably more effective at liberating oleic acid (Table I). With 106bacteria/ml, the maximum span in relative efficiency of autoclaved membrane phospholipid hydrolysis for wild type versus mutant hGIIA is 125-fold, which compares with the maximum span of >1,000-fold for the bactericidal activity of these proteins against 106/ml live S. aureus (Table I). In contrast to results with B. subtilus protoplasts, none of the hGIIA mutants display specific activity on autoclaved S. aureusmembranes higher than that of wild type. With the availability of all"

To investigate the role of CaMKII in cardiac function, we made transgenic (TG) mice that express the nuclear δB isoform of CaMKII. The expressed CaMKIIδB transgene was restricted to the myocardium and highly concentrated in the nucleus. Cardiac hypertrophy was evidenced by an increased left ventricle to body weight ratio and up-regulation of embryonic and contractile protein genes including atrial natriuretic factor, β-myosin heavy chain, and α-skeletal actin. Echocardiography revealed ventricular dilation and decreased cardiac function, which was also observed in hemodynamic measurements from CaMKIIδB TG mice. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of phospholamban at both Thr17 and Ser16 was significantly decreased in the basal state as well as upon adrenergic stimulation. This was associated with diminished sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake in vitro and altered relaxation properties in vivo. The activity and expression of protein phosphatase 2A were both found to be increased in CaMKII TG mice, and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that protein phosphatase 2A directly associates with CaMKII. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that CaMKII can induce hypertrophy and dilation in vivo and indicate that compensatory increases in phosphatase activity contribute to the resultant phenotype.

Cardiac hypertrophy was evidenced by an increased left ventricle to body weight ratio and up-regulation of embryonic and contractile protein genes including atrial natriuretic factor, β-myosin heavy chain, and α-skeletal actin. Echocardiography revealed ventricular dilation and decreased cardiac function, which was also observed in hemodynamic measurements from CaMKIIδB TG mice. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of phospholamban at both Thr17 and Ser16 was significantly decreased in the basal state as well as upon adrenergic stimulation. This was associated with diminished sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake in vitro and altered relaxation properties in vivo. The activity and expression of protein phosphatase 2A were both found to be increased in CaMKII TG mice, and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that protein phosphatase 2A directly associates with CaMKII. Our findings are the first to demonstrate that CaMKII can induce hypertrophy and dilation in vivo and indicate that compensatory increases in phosphatase activity contribute to the resultant phenotype. transgenic atrial natriuretic factor the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ ATPase phospholamban myosin heavy chain sarcoplasmic reticulum hemagglutinin wild type protein phosphatase 2A protein phosphatase 1 left ventricle 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Although cardiac hypertrophy is a beneficial adaptive response of the heart to a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, chronic hypertrophy often leads to dilated cardiomyopathy and eventually to heart failure if the stimulus is not relieved (1Katz A.M. J. Card. Fail. 1998; 4: 67-81Google Scholar). A hallmark of the pathological transition from hypertrophy to heart failure is decreased cardiac contractility. Cardiac hypertrophy has also been reported to be an independent risk factor for ischemic heart disease, arrhythmia, and sudden death (2Harjai K.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 1999; 131: 376-386Google Scholar). The development of these pathophysiological end points highlights the need to understand the cellular signaling events that regulate cardiac growth and function. Ca2+ signals have long been known to play a central role in the regulation of cardiac contractility and more recently have been considered as likely regulators of growth and gene expression. A role for Ca2+ signaling in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy is supported by a growing body of evidence. For example, transgenic (TG)1 mice with a 3–5-fold overexpression of the Ca2+-binding protein, calmodulin, develop severe cardiac hypertrophy (3Gruver C.L. DeMayo F. Goldstein M.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 376-388Google Scholar). This chronic elevation of calmodulin in the ventricles of TG mice was more recently shown to increase CaMKII phosphorylation, an index of the Ca2+-independent activity of CaMKII, and the expression of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) (4Colomer J.M. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1125-1136Google Scholar), an established indicator of ventricular hypertrophy. In cultured ventricular myocytes, electrical pacing can elevate intracellular Ca2+, and this is essential for cardiac myocytes to respond with increased expression of ANF and myosin light chain-2, another marker of hypertrophy (5McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Google Scholar). In addition, the calmodulin antagonist W-7 can block hypertrophy of primary cultured cardiomyocytes in response to electrical pacing and α-adrenergic stimulation (5McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Google Scholar), further implicating Ca2+ as a mediator of cardiac gene expression in the hypertrophic response. An alternate effector of the Ca2+/calmodulin complex is calcineurin, a protein phosphatase that has recently attracted attention as a mediator of hypertrophic stimuli in vitro andin vivo (6Molkentin J.D. Lu J.-R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Google Scholar, 7Olson E.N. Molkentin J.D. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 623-632Google Scholar). The Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) are critical transducers of Ca2+ signals (8Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Google Scholar). The CaMK family, consisting of CaMKI, CaMKII, and CaMKIV, has an extremely wide tissue distribution and is represented to varying degrees in all eukaryotic systems examined. These multifunctional kinases can phosphorylate a range of substrates in vitro and in situ, including ryanodine receptors (9Witcher D.R. Kovacs R.J. Schulman H. Cefali D.C. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11144-11152Google Scholar), sarcoplasmic reticular Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) (10Xu A. Hawkins C. Narayanan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8394-8397Google Scholar), phospholamban (PLB) (11Lindemann J.P. Watanabe A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4516-4525Google Scholar, 12Karczewski P. Kuschel M. Baltas L.G. Bartel S. Krause E.G. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1997; 92: 37-43Google Scholar), L-type Ca2+ channels (13Anderson M.E. Braun A.P. Schulman H. Premack B.A. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 854-861Google Scholar), activating transcription factor-1 (14Sun P. Lou L. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3066-3073Google Scholar), and cAMP response element-binding protein (14Sun P. Lou L. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3066-3073Google Scholar, 15Sheng M. Thompson M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1991; 252: 1427-1430Google Scholar). Whereas CaMKI and CaMKIV are monomeric, CaMKII exists as a multimer of 8–12 subunits, encoded by four separate genes: α, β, γ, and δ (8Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Google Scholar, 16Kanaseki T. Ikeuchi Y. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1049-1060Google Scholar). Several laboratories have identified CaMK II δ as the predominant isoform in the heart (17Edman C.F. Schulman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 89-101Google Scholar, 18Miyano O. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1198-1203Google Scholar, 19Schworer C.M. Rothblum L.I. Thekkumkara T.J. Singer H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14443-14449Google Scholar, 20Mayer P. Mohlig M. Idlibe D. Pfeiffer A. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1995; 90: 372-379Google Scholar, 21Baltas L.G. Karczewski P. Krause E.-G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 71-75Google Scholar) and several distinct splice variants (δB, δC, et al.), characterized by the presence of a second variable domain are expressed (17Edman C.F. Schulman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 89-101Google Scholar, 21Baltas L.G. Karczewski P. Krause E.-G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 71-75Google Scholar). The δB isoform contains an 11-amino acid nuclear localization signal that is absent from CaMKIIδC. Thus the δB isoform localizes to the nucleus in both fibroblast cells and cardiomyocytes, whereas the δC isoform localizes to the cytoplasm (17Edman C.F. Schulman H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1221: 89-101Google Scholar, 22Srinivasan M. Edman C.F. Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 839-852Google Scholar, 23Ramirez M.T. Zhao X. Schulman H. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31203-31208Google Scholar). Our lab previously showed that transient expression of CaMKIIδB in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes induced gene expression and resulted in an enhanced response to phenylephrine, as assessed by transcriptional activation of an ANF-luciferase reporter gene (23Ramirez M.T. Zhao X. Schulman H. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31203-31208Google Scholar). The nuclear localization signal of CaMKIIδBwas required for this response because expression of CaMKIIδC did not result in enhanced ANF expression (23Ramirez M.T. Zhao X. Schulman H. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31203-31208Google Scholar). Activated CaMKI and IV can also induce hypertrophic responses in cultured cardiomyocytes (24Passier R. Zeng H. Frey N. Naya F.J. Nicol R.L. McKinsey T.A. Overbeek P.A. Richardson J.A. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1395-1406Google Scholar) and the CaMKII inhibitor KN-62 can block cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in response to endothelin-1 (25Zhu W. Zou Y. Shiojima I. Kudoh S. Aikawa R. Hayashi D. Mizukami M. Toko H. Shibasaki F. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Komuro I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15239-15245Google Scholar). Of particular significance is the demonstration that hypertrophy develops in TG mice that express increased levels of CaMKIV in the myocardium (24Passier R. Zeng H. Frey N. Naya F.J. Nicol R.L. McKinsey T.A. Overbeek P.A. Richardson J.A. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1395-1406Google Scholar). CaMKIV is expressed at very low levels in the heart relative to CaMKII (8Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Google Scholar, 18Miyano O. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1198-1203Google Scholar), but it has, in common with the predominant cardiac CaMKIIδB isoform, the ability to enter the nucleus. To investigate the role of CaMKII in the intact heart, we used the well characterized cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter to generate TG mice that express CaMKIIδB isoform. We demonstrate here that overexpression of wild type CaMKIIδB in the mouse heart induces cardiac hypertrophy and dilation with decreased ventricular function and that this is associated with changes in protein phosphorylation, phosphatase activity, and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ uptake. Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged rat wild type CaMKIIδB cDNA was subcloned into a pBluescript-based TG vector (a gift from J. Robbins, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH) between the 5.5-kb murine α-MHC promoter and a polyadenylation signal. Purified linear transgene fragments were injected into pronuclei of fertilized mouse oocytes. The resultant pups were screened for the presence of the transgene by PCR as described previously (26Sah V.P. Minamisawa S. Tam S.P. Wu T.H. Dorn G.W. Ross J.Jr. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1627-1634Google Scholar), using a CaMKII-specific primer (5′-TTGAAGGGTGCCATCTTGACA-3′) and a TG vector-specific primer (5′-CGCTCTAGAACTAGTGGACT-3′). Founder mice were bred with C57BL/6 wild type mice. Heterozygous animals from at least the third generation were used for all studies, with their wild type (WT) littermates serving as controls. All procedures were performed in accordance withGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (45Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.7th Ed. National Academy Press, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar) and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Frozen powdered ventricular tissue was resuspended in ice-cold kinase sample buffer (50 mm PIPES, 10 mm EGTA, 20 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) prior to sonication for 10 s. Protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay, and the homogenates were diluted to 10 mg/ml protein. Kinase activity was measured using a previously published method (27Hanson P.I. Kapiloff M.S. Lou L.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Schulman H. Neuron. 1989; 3: 59-70Google Scholar). Frozen powdered ventricular tissue was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors as a mixture from Sigma-Aldrich). The homogenized hearts were centrifuged in an air centrifuge for 10 min in a cold room. The supernatant was considered to be cytosol, and the pellet was treated with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 to solubilize the proteins. This last extract was centrifuged as before, and the supernatant was considered as particulate. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity was measured using32P-labeled phosphorylase as a substrate, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity was measured using a32P-labeled synthetic peptide (RRATpVA) that is selective for PP2A as described recently (28duBell W.H. Gigena M.S. Guatimosim S. Long X. Lederer W.J. Rogers T.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 282: H38-H48Google Scholar). Cardiac homogenates were prepared as described previously (29Ramirez M.T. Sah V.P. Zhao X. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14057-14061Google Scholar). Cytosolic and particulate fractions were prepared as stated above. In some experiments, a nuclear fraction was prepared from mouse hearts using a Wheaton Dounce homogenizer as described previously (30Mascareno E. Dhar M. Siddiqui M.A.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5590-5594Google Scholar). The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were as follows: mouse anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), CaMKIIδ antibody (rabbit antiserum against a 15-amino acid peptide in the carboxyl-terminal region of CaMKIIδ), monoclonal anti-PLB (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), phosphorylated PLB (Thr17 and Ser16) antibodies (Fluorescience, Leeks, UK), CaMKII antibody (Santa Cruz), phosphorylated CaMKII antibody (Affinity Bioreagents), PP2A/C and PP2A/B56α antibodies (BD Transduction Laboratories), and PP2A/A antibody (Oxford Biomedical Research). The secondary antibody is a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed using the SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Detection System (Pierce). RNA was prepared from ventricular tissue using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and dot blot analysis was performed as described previously (26Sah V.P. Minamisawa S. Tam S.P. Wu T.H. Dorn G.W. Ross J.Jr. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1627-1634Google Scholar, 31Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Doetschman T. Grupp G. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Boivin G. Gulick J. Ng W.A. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1906-1917Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. After endotracheal intubation, the mice were connected to a volume-cycled rodent ventilator. A PE-50 catheter was placed in the left jugular vein and used for intravenous access. Through the right carotid artery a 1.8-French high fidelity catheter tip micromanometer was inserted via a small incision, and the tip was manipulated across the aortic valve into the left ventricle (LV). A bilateral vagotomy was performed. When LV pressure and heart rate became stable, dobutamine was given intravenously by an infusion pump, at a rate at 0.75, 2, 4, 8, and 12 μg/kg/min. Atrial pacing was accomplished using a guide wire placed in the right atrium via the right jugular vein. Prior to pacing, the heart rate was controlled at a slow, stable rate using UL-FS 49, a selective sinus node inhibitor, at a dosage of 0.05 mg given intravenously to achieve a rate of 150–250 beats/min. Heart rate was then increased by atrial pacing in steps of 50 beats/min. There was 30 s between two steps. Then dobutamine was given intravenously at 2 μg/kg/min for 3 min, and the pacing was repeated. Data analysis was done by computer, and 12 beats were averaged. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 2.5% Avertin (15 μl/g body weight). The current echocardiographic system is an Agilent Technologies, Sonos 5500 with a 15 MHz linear probe that utilizes ultraband technology. M-mode and Doppler tracing were recorded at a sweep speed of 150 mm/s. At least three independent M-mode measurements/animal were obtained by an examiner blinded to the genotype of the animals. Ventricular tissue from TG and littermate control mouse hearts was homogenized at 4 °C in 1.5 ml of homogenizing solution (25 mmimidazole, pH 7.0) with a Teflon glass Thomas tissue grinder. SR Ca2+ uptake assays were performed in ventricular homogenates at room temperature based on a protocol modified from that of Pagani and Solaro (32Pagani E.D. Solaro R.J. Methods Pharmacol. 1984; 5: 49-61Google Scholar). Aliquots (350 μl) of homogenates were transferred into tubes containing 2.8 ml of uptake buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm potassium oxalate, 40 mm imidazole, 10 mm sodium azide, 4.5 mm MgCl2) and 45Ca-EGTA buffer containing 0.185 μCi/ml 45Ca (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and a given amount of free Ca2+ (20 and 200 nm), which was calculated on the basis of the amount of added EGTA. After 5 min of preincubation, the uptake reaction was initiated by the addition of 2.5 mm sodium ATP. Ca2+ uptake was terminated at various times (1, 3, and 5 min for 200 nm free Ca2+; 1, 10, and 20 min for 20 nm free Ca2+) by filtering 500-μl aliquots on 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore-type HA), followed by two washes (5 ml) with uptake buffer without Ca2+ or ATP. The radioactivity remaining on the nitrocellulose filters was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Protein concentration in the ventricular homogenates was assayed with a Bradford reagent. Ca2+ uptake was calculated from the slope of the linear regression analysis relating 45Ca2+uptake/milligram of protein to reaction time. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from WT and CaMKIIδB TG mice following recently published methods (33Zhou Y.-Y. Wang S.-Q. Zhu W.-Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B.K. Ziman B. Wang S. Lakatta E.G. Cheng H. Xiao R.-P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H429-H436Google Scholar) and cultured on laminin-coated (3.5 μg/cm2; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) chamber slides overnight. Indirect immunofluorescence stainings were performed as described previously (34Adams J.W. Sah V.P. Henderson S.A. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 167-178Google Scholar). The CaMKIIδB transgene was detected using rabbit anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:100 dilution) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Cappel, 1:100 dilution). The cells were observed by a Zeiss Axiovert 135 fluorescence microscope and photographed using a CCD camera. All of the data are reported as the means ± S.E. The statistical significance of difference between the WT mice and CaMKIIδB TG mice was determined using unpaired Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. TG mice expressing HA-tagged rat wild type CaMKIIδB under the control of the cardiac-specific α-MHC promoter were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Three TG founders showed germline transmission of the transgene. Significant expression of the transgene was seen only in the heart based on examination with the anti-HA antibody (Fig.1A). The CaMKIIδB TG line studied in detail here showed at least a 10-fold overexpression of CaMKIIδ in the heart, based on Western blots using the anti-CaMKIIδ antibody (Fig. 1B). Enzymatic activity of CaMKII measured in ventricular homogenates was ∼4-fold higher in the TG animals than in the littermate controls (Fig.1C). The discrepancy between CaMK activity and expression may be due at least in part to the fact that the activity assay includes other isoforms of CaMKII. The phosphorylation state of CaMKII reflects its Ca2+-independent activity. Experiments using a phospho-CaMKII antibody revealed a ∼1.5-fold increase in the CaMKIIδB TG mice (Fig. 1D). Immunocytochemical staining of cardiomyocytes isolated from the TG animals using a HA antibody confirmed that the CaMKIIδB transgene was, as predicted based on its nuclear localization signal, present and highly concentrated in the nucleus (Fig. 2).Figure 2Immunocytochemical staining of ventricular myocytes isolated from WT and CaMKIIδBTG mice. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from WT and TG mice and cultured on laminin-coated chamber slides overnight. Indirect immunofluorescence stainings were performed. Transgene was detected by rabbit anti-HA antibody (1:100 dilution) followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:100 dilution). The transgene is present and highly concentrated in the nucleus. 100 cells of each group were examined. Cytoplasmic staining was not observed in any cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Most CaMKIIδB TG mice showed significantly enlarged hearts at 3∼4 months of age (that shown in Fig. 3A is a typical one). On average, CaMKIIδB TG mice exhibited a 22% increase in heart weight to body weight ratio and a 27% increase in left ventricle to body weight ratio at 12 weeks of age (Fig. 3B). Body weights in the TG and WT mice were equivalent; thus the heart to body weight ratio increase in the TG mice is due to increased ventricular mass. To determine whether specific alterations in cardiac gene expression were associated with CaMKIIδB overexpression, RNA was isolated from mouse ventricles, and a selected panel of hypertrophic genes was examined by dot blot analysis. As shown in Fig.3C, ANF, β-MHC, and α-skeletal actin mRNA levels were significantly increased in TG ventricles, and there was a modest but significant decrease in α-MHC, SERCA, and PLB mRNA levels. To assess chamber size and cardiac function in CaMKIIδB TG mice, we performed echocardiography on 3–4-month-old mice. As shown in Fig.4, left ventricular end diastolic diameter and left ventricular end systolic diameter in TG mice were increased by 14 and 31%, respectively. The calculated left ventricular mass was increased by 20%, consistent with changes described above. Fractional shortening and velocity of circumferential shortening, which reflect left ventricular contractile function, also decreased significantly in TG mice compared with the control mice. Hemodynamic measurements of cardiac contractility and relaxation demonstrated that both +dP/dt and −dP/dt responses to pacing were blunted in hearts of TG mice (Fig. 5,A and B). Stimulation with dobutamine, a β-adrenergic receptor agonist, should increase Ca2+, either directly or indirectly and might therefore activate CaMKIIδB in the TG mice. However, dose response curves to this β-adrenergic agonist were not significantly altered in TGversus WT mouse hearts (Fig. 5, C andD). The decreased relaxation properties observed in the hemodynamic measurements led us to assess changes in SR Ca2+ uptake. Experiments examining Ca2+ uptake in SR containing cardiac homogenates revealed that SR Ca2+uptake was significantly decreased in ventricles from 3–4-month-old TG mice (Fig. 6A). Because SR Ca2+ uptake is regulated by PLB phosphorylation and by the SERCA/PLB ratio, we asked whether the decrease in SR Ca2+uptake could be the result of altered PLB phosphorylation or an altered SERCA/PLB ratio in the CaMKIIδB TG mice. PLB is regulated by phosphorylation of Thr17 by CaMKII and of Ser16 by PKA. Interestingly, both Thr17- and Ser16-phosphorylated PLB were significantly decreased in extracts prepared from 3–4-month-old TG mouse hearts (Fig.6B). There was no change in total PLB protein or SERCA protein (data not shown). Because the basal state of PLB phosphorylation is generally low, we also examined PLB phosphorylation in hearts rapidly frozen after stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors with dobutamine. The levels of Thr17- and Ser16-phosphorylated PLB remained significantly lower in TGversus WT mice even following stimulation (Fig.6C). Thus maximal phosphorylation of neither the PKA nor the CaMKII site could be achieved in the TG animals. The decreased phosphorylation of PLB was unexpected and led us to hypothesize that phosphatases might be increased in CaMKIIδB TG mice. We therefore assayed PP1 and PP2A phosphatase activity in WT and TG mouse hearts. As shown in Fig.7A, PP2A activity was selectively increased in the particulate fraction from TG mouse hearts. There was no change in PP2A activity in the cytosol (Fig.7A), nor was PP1 activity altered in either fraction (data not shown). Western blots examining phosphatase expression levels also showed no change in PP1 or PP2A in the cytosol from TG hearts (data not shown). However, in the particulate fraction from TG hearts, increases in expression of the catalytic as well as the A subunit and the B56α targeting subunit of PP2A were observed (Fig. 7B). This did not occur at the transcriptional level, because Northern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled PP2A catalytic subunit cDNA fragment as a probe revealed no difference in PP2A mRNA levels in TG and WT hearts (data not shown). There is growing evidence for association of phosphatases and kinases in signaling complexes. In particular, CaMKIV has been shown to interact with PP2A catalytic subunit (35Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Google Scholar). To determine whether there was a direct interaction between PP2A and CaMKII in cardiomyocytes, we first examined association of these molecules in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Immunoprecipitation with either CaMKII or PP2A catalytic subunit antibody followed by Western blots with the opposite antibody demonstrated that CaMKII associates with PP2A in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (data not shown). In addition, we demonstrated that there was an increase in PP2A catalytic subunit that coimmunoprecipitated with CaMKII in the particulate fraction (Fig.7C) as well as in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 7D) prepared from TG mouse ventricles. A variety of studies performed throughout the last decade suggest that Ca2+ signaling is a central mechanism triggering hypertrophic growth (3Gruver C.L. DeMayo F. Goldstein M.A. Means A.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 376-388Google Scholar, 4Colomer J.M. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1125-1136Google Scholar, 5McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11665-11668Google Scholar, 6Molkentin J.D. Lu J.-R. Antos C.L. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Google Scholar). A likely sensor for the effects of elevated calcium is CaMK, an enzyme suggested to mediate changes in cell growth and gene expression in a number of neuronal systems (36Solem M. McMahon T. Messing R.O. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5966-5975Google Scholar, 37Hu S.C. Chrivia J. Ghosh A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 799-808Google Scholar). Most studies linking CaMK to control of gene expression have focused on the effects of CaMKIV because it is a momoneric enzyme that, in contrast to the multimeric CaMKII, is readily able to enter the nucleus. Recently published work demonstrated that CaMKIV could induce hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes in vitro and that CaMKIV expression can cause cardiac hypertrophy in TG mice (24Passier R. Zeng H. Frey N. Naya F.J. Nicol R.L. McKinsey T.A. Overbeek P.A. Richardson J.A. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1395-1406Google Scholar). In contrast, there is no information concerning the effects of CaMKIIδ, the CaMK subtype that predominates in the heart, on myocardial cell growthin vivo. The findings reported here utilized the α-MHC promoter to drive the expression of the wild type isoform of CaMKIIδB. This approach has been applied to a number of genes and has been shown to lead to considerable increases in mRNA and generally also in the protein of interest in the TG mouse heart. In the present report we assessed not only increases in protein expression but also examined concomitant changes in enzyme activity and in the extent to which there is active enzyme in the myocardium in vivo. Interestingly, these further measures allow one to “rationalize” the use of 10-fold overexpression by demonstrating that this leads to only a 4-fold increase in the total cellular CaMKII pool and only a 1.5-fold increase in the amount of active CaMKIIin vivo. The modest increase in the amount of active kinase associated with overexpression of the wild type form of CaMKII probably accounts for the relatively mild phenotype. On the other hand, the increase is clearly within a range that would reflect physiological increases in CaMKII activity. A variety of end points confirm that CaMKIIδB TG mice develop cardiac hypertrophy by 3–4 months of age. These include statistically significant increases in heart and left ventricle to body weight ratios, up-regulation of embryonic and contractile protein genes including ANF, β-MHC, and α-skeletal actin, and down-regulation of α-MHC, SERCA, and PLB genes. These hypertrophic changes in ventricular mass and gene expression were associated with development of a dilated cardiomyopathy in the CaMKIIδB TG mice. Specifically, these mice showed ventricular dilation and decreased contractile function, as documented by echocardiography, and impairment of the force-frequency response, as assessed by hemodynamic measurements. The observation that overexpression of CaMKIIδB can induce cardiac hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy indicates that the phenotype previously reported for CaMKIV TG mice (24Passier R. Zeng H. Frey N. Naya F.J. Nicol R.L. McKinsey T.A. Overbeek P.A. Richardson J.A. Grant S.R. Olson E.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1395-1406Google Scholar) mirrors that elicited by expression (and presumably activation) of the endogenous cardiac CaMK. PLB is a substrate for CaMKII. Although we did not anticipate enhanced phosphorylation of this cytosolic substrate by the nuclear CaMKIIδB, we were surprised to observe that PLB phosphorylation was actually decreased. Notably phosphorylation of both the CaMKII and the PKA site were decreased by 33∼50% under conditions of both basal activity and adrenergic stimulation. Furthermore, functional effects of the diminished phosphorylation were evident as a decrease in contractility and relaxation in vivo and a decrease in SR Ca2+ uptake in vitro. The decreased PLB phosphorylation associated with heart failure has been suggested to result from β-adrenergic receptor desensitization (38Szymanska G. Stromer H. Silverman M. Belu-John Y. Morgan J.P. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 439: 1-10Google Scholar, 39Hajjar R.J. Muller F.U. Schmitz W. Schnabel P. Bohm M. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 747-755Google Scholar); however, hemodynamic measurements did not reveal significantly diminished β-adrenergic responsiveness in the CaMKII TG mice. The basis for the global decrease in PLB phosphorylation seen in the CaMKIIδB TG mice would therefore appear to be the increase in phosphatase activity. Our preliminary observation (data not shown) that PLB phosphorylation is not decreased, and the fact that phosphatase activity is not significantly elevated in 6-week-old TG mice further suggests that PLB phosphorylation is diminished secondary to increases in phosphatase activity. Decreased basal levels of Ser16 and Thr17phosphorylated PLB and prolonged relaxation were recently reported in postinfarction remodeled myocytes and partially explained by increased PP1 activity (40Huang B. Wang S. Qin D. Boutjdir M. El-Sherif N. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 848-855Google Scholar). Although there is evidence that PP1 is mainly responsible for the dephosphorylation of PLB (41Macdougall L.K. Jones L.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 725-734Google Scholar, 42Steenart N.A.E. Di Ganim J.R. Salvo J.D. Kranias E.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 297: 17-24Google Scholar), PP2A can also dephosphorylate this substrate (41Macdougall L.K. Jones L.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 196: 725-734Google Scholar, 43Neumann J. Maas R. Boknik P. Jones L.R. Zimmermann N. Scholz H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 188-193Google Scholar). We observed no change in PP1 activity in CaMKII TG mice. However, hearts from CaMKII TG mice had increased PP2A activity and increased expression of the catalytic, and regulatory A, and B56α subunits in the particulate fraction. The particulate fraction is comprised of membranes from various cellular organelles. Increased PP2A is evident in nuclei in association with CaMKII (see below); however, the changes in PLB phosphorylation suggested that PP2A might also be increased in the SR membrane. This was supported by the observation that PP2A protein level increased ∼60% in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction, which would include SR (data not shown). The observation that the increase in PP2A was confined to the membrane-associated particulate fraction suggested the possibility that PP2A was localized in a complex of signaling molecules. Accordingly we asked whether there was a direct association between PP2A and CaMKII. Studies using neonatal rat ventricular myocytes demonstrated that endogenous CaMKII coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous PP2A and vice versa. Furthermore, there was an increase in PP2A associated with CaMKII in the particulate fraction as well as in the nuclear fraction from TG mice. Although the mechanism for the increase in PP2A activity and its association with CaMKII is not known, we suggest that this alteration contributes to the development of the cardiomyopathy, particularly to the decreased contractile function observed in CaMKIIδB TG mice. In this regard, it is of interest that a recent study reported that TG mice expressing a mutant A subunit of PP2A exhibit a dilated cardiomyopathy (44Brewis N. Ohst K. Fields K. Rapacciuolo A. Chou D. Bloor C. Dillmann W.H. Rockman H.A. Walter G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H1307-H1318Google Scholar). The generation and analysis of TG mice overexpressing CaMKIIδB support the conclusion that physiologically relevant levels of activation of the predominant cardiac isoform of CaMK II can function within the nucleus to induce cardiac gene expression and hypertrophy. In addition, kinase increases in both the amount and the activity may be associated with compensatory increases in phosphatase activity, and these may contribute to changes in SR function and Ca2+ handling that underlie the impairment of ventricular function.

Phosphorylation of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), a GPCR for thrombin, is important for desensitization and internalization, however, the role of β-arrestins in signaling and trafficking of PAR1 remains unknown. To assess β-arrestin function we examined signaling and trafficking of PAR1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from β-arrestin (βarr) knockouts. Desensitization of PAR1 signaling was markedly impaired in MEFs lacking both βarr1 and βarr2 isoforms compared with wild-type cells. Strikingly, in cells lacking only βarr1 PAR1 desensitization was also significantly impaired compared with βarr2-lacking or wild-type cells. In wild-type MEFs, activated PAR1 was internalized through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway and degraded. Surprisingly, in cells lacking both βarr1 and βarr2 activated PAR1 was similarly internalized through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway and degraded, whereas the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) failed to internalize. A PAR1 cytoplasmic tail mutant defective in agonist-induced phosphorylation failed to internalize in both wild-type and β-arrestin knockout cells. Thus, PAR1 appears to utilize a distinct phosphorylation-dependent but β-arrestin-independent pathway for internalization through clathrin-coated pits.

PAR1 couples to Gq, Gi, and G12/13 to elicit a variety of signaling events important for hemostasis, thrombosis, and embryonic development (1Coughlin S.R.

PAR1 is activated by thrombin through an unusual proteolytic mechanism. Thrombin, a serine protease, binds to and cleaves the extracellular amino terminus of PAR1 (3Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar). The newly formed amino terminus of PAR1 then functions as a tethered peptide ligand by interacting with the receptor to trigger signaling (3Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar, 4Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Hung D.T. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1991; 353: 674-677Google Scholar, 5Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Google Scholar). Despite PAR1's irreversible proteolytic mechanism of activation and the generation of a tethered ligand that cannot diffuse away, signaling by the receptor is rapidly terminated at the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanisms responsible for termination of PAR1 signaling are not clearly understood.The molecular mechanisms responsible for GPCR desensitization and resensitization have been extensively studied for the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) (6Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Google Scholar, 7Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar). In this model GPCRs are initially desensitized by rapid phosphorylation of the activated form of the receptor by G protein-coupled kinases (GRKs). Phosphorylated receptor then binds arrestin, which impedes interaction with G proteins. Arrestin also facilitates GPCR internalization by interacting with clathrin and the adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2), components of the endocytic machinery (8Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Google Scholar, 9Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Google Scholar). Once internalized into endosomes, receptor dissociates from the ligand, becomes dephosphorylated, and is then recycled back to the plasma membrane ready for activation again.Phosphorylation of activated PAR1 initiates rapid desensitization and internalization from the plasma membrane. Overexpression of GRK3 and GRK5 enhances PAR1 phosphorylation and markedly inhibits PAR1 signaling (10Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Google Scholar, 11Tiruppathi C. Yan W. Sandoval R. Naqvi T. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Malik A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7440-7445Google Scholar). Activation of PAR1 cytoplasmic tail mutants that were not phosphorylated signaled more robustly than wild-type PAR1 (12Nanevicz T. Wang L. Chen M. Ishii M. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 702-706Google Scholar, 13Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Google Scholar). Moreover, these same mutants also failed to exhibit agonist-triggered internalization. Interestingly, a cytoplasmic tail mutant of PAR1 with limited alanine substitution for serines between residues 391 and 406 is phosphorylated but defective in its ability to uncouple from signaling (14Hammes S.R. Shapiro M.J. Coughlin S.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Google Scholar). This same receptor mutant is internalized following activation like wild-type PAR1. Together, these findings suggest that phosphorylation of PAR1's cytoplasmic tail is important for both rapid desensitization and internalization, however, distinct mechanisms may regulate these processes.Internalization and lysosomal sorting of activated PAR1 is also important for termination of receptor signaling. Activated PAR1 is internalized through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway, like many recycling receptors (15Hoxie J.A. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Pizarro S. Parton R. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Google Scholar, 16Trejo J. Altschuler Y. Fu H.-W. Mostov K.E. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31255-31265Google Scholar). Once internalized, PAR1 is sorted away from recycling receptors and targeted to lysosomes for degradation; an event critical for termination of receptor signaling (17Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Google Scholar, 18Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Google Scholar, 19Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Google Scholar). In transfected fibroblasts, a mutant PAR1 able to internalize and recycle to the cell surface signaled persistently after activation by thrombin (19Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Google Scholar). This prolonged signaling is apparently due to recycling and continued signaling by receptors that return to the plasma membrane with their tethered ligands intact. Thus, phosphorylation of activated PAR1 promotes rapid desensitization at the plasma membrane while internalization and lysosomal sorting prevents the receptor from recycling and continuing to signal on the cell surface.The β-arrestin isoforms 1 and 2 are widely expressed and bind to phosphorylated GPCRs to mediate desensitization and internalization (20Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharm. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PAR1 is important for desensitization and internalization, however, the role of arrestins in signaling and trafficking of PAR1 is not known. In this study, we investigate the function of arrestin in PAR1 signaling and trafficking through the use of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from β-arrestin (βarr) knockouts (21Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar). Our findings strongly suggest that βarr1 functions as the predominant regulator of PAR1 desensitization. Moreover, these studies reveal a novel mechanism by which GPCRs can internalize through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway that is independent of β-arrestins.DISCUSSIONPAR1's proteolytic mechanism of activation is clearly distinct from that of most GPCRs and raises questions regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for termination of PAR1 signaling. Phosphorylation of activated PAR1 is important for both rapid termination of receptor signaling and internalization from the plasma membrane (12Nanevicz T. Wang L. Chen M. Ishii M. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 702-706Google Scholar, 13Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Google Scholar). Many phosphorylated GPCRs bind arrestins, which uncouple the receptor from signaling and facilitate receptor internalization (20Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharm. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Google Scholar). The role of arrestins in the regulation of PAR1 signaling and trafficking has not previously been determined. Prior studies have used heterologous overexpression of wild-type and dominant-negative forms of arrestin to assess function; however, such studies are often complicated by the expression of endogenous protein. Our recent generation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from β-arrestin knockouts offered an opportunity to assess function in cells in which the expression of the individual arrestin isoforms was eliminated genetically by gene knockout (21Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar). We therefore assessed signaling and trafficking of PAR1 in cells that lack either one or both isoforms of β-arrestin.PAR1 is endogenously expressed in MEFs, and thrombin signaling is completely abolished in MEFs derived from PAR1 knockout mice, thus PAR1 is the predominant mediator of thrombin signaling in these cells (38Connolly A.J. Ishihara H. Kahn M.L. Farese R.V. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 516-519Google Scholar). In cells lacking both β-arrestin isoforms (βarr1,2−/−) endogenous PAR1 signaling was significantly more robust than wild-type controls. Consistent with these results, in transfected MEFs expressing similar amounts of PAR1, the rate of PAR1 desensitization was significantly slowed, resulting in a greater accumulation of inositol phosphates in β-arrestin knockouts compared with wild-type control cells. Thus, in the absence of β-arrestins, desensitization of PAR1 signaling is significantly impaired. To our knowledge these findings are the first to demonstrate a role for β-arrestins in regulation of PAR1 signaling. Moreover, in cells that lack only βarr1, the rate of PAR1 desensitization was markedly impaired compared with βarr2 lacking cells and wild-type controls. These results strongly suggest that the βarr1 isoform functions as the predominant regulator of PAR1 desensitization. These findings contrast with our recent report in which both β-arrestin isoforms were found to be equally effective in regulating desensitization of β2-AR and AT1A-R using these same knockout cells (21Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar). Thus, these studies provide the first example in which the β-arrestin isoforms can differentially regulate GPCR desensitization.In addition to regulating GPCR desensitization, β-arrestins can facilitate GPCR internalization. Arrestins bind phosphorylated GPCRs and interact with clathrin and the adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2) to promote receptor internalization (8Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Google Scholar, 9Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Google Scholar). PAR1 requires phosphorylation for internalization through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway (13Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Google Scholar, 16Trejo J. Altschuler Y. Fu H.-W. Mostov K.E. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31255-31265Google Scholar), raising the possibility that arrestin might function in this process. In contrast, we found that activated PAR1 is internalized through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway even when both β-arrestin isoforms are absent. Constitutive internalization of PAR1 was also intact in β-arrestin knockout cells. Interestingly, PAR1 internalization required phosphorylation even in the absence of β-arrestins. Together, these findings are consistent with a distinct phosphorylation-dependent but arrestin-independent pathway for PAR1 internalization. By contrast, the β2-AR failed to internalize in these same β-arrestin knockout cells. The β2-AR is known to bind arrestin and internalize through a classic dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway (39Ferguson S.S. Downey W.r. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Google Scholar). Thus, the failure of β2-AR to internalize in β-arrestin knockout cells that show robust PAR1 internalization suggests that these receptors have distinct requirements for internalization through clathrin-coated pits. Together, these studies provide strong evidence for a novel mechanism by which GPCRs can internalize through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway that is independent of arrestins.The relative contributions of receptor uncoupling via phosphorylation and arrestin binding versus receptor internalization to the rapid termination of PAR1 signaling remain poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that, in the absence of β-arrestins, rapid desensitization of PAR1 signaling is markedly impaired while internalization remains intact. Thus, internalization is not required for rapid desensitization of PAR1 signaling. In many cases, arrestins can mediate both desensitization and internalization of GPCRs (21Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar); our observations, however, are consistent with a distinct arrestin-independent mechanism for PAR1 internalization. This is also consistent with a recent report in which termination of PAR1 signaling and internalization were separated by mutation of phosphorylation sites within PAR1's cytoplasmic tail (14Hammes S.R. Shapiro M.J. Coughlin S.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Google Scholar). Similar mutants have been reported for the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (40Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Google Scholar). In cells lacking arrestins PAR1 signaling was eventually slowed; this may be due to internalization and lysosomal sorting of activated PAR1. Indeed, a mutant PAR1 that internalized and recycled back to the cell surface signaled persistently following activation by thrombin (19Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Google Scholar). These studies strongly suggest that internalization and lysosomal sorting are critical for termination of PAR1 signaling (18Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Google Scholar, 19Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Google Scholar). Thus, β-arrestin is required for rapid desensitization of PAR1 signaling, whereas internalization and lysosomal sorting appear to contribute to termination of PAR1 signaling observed at later times.Internalization of GPCRs through clathrin-coated pits is a multistep process involving numerous proteins. β-Arrestins bind to clathrin and the adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2) and thereby link phosphorylated GPCRs to the endocytic machinery (8Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Google Scholar, 9Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Google Scholar). It is becoming increasingly clear that the individual β-arrestin isoforms can differentially regulate GPCR internalization. The β2-AR preferentially utilizes βarr2 for sequestration through clathrin-coated pits, whereas both β-arrestin isoforms were equally effective for internalization of the AT1A-R (21Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon recruitment to activated receptors, βarr1 undergoes dephosphorylation at a carboxyl-terminal serine residue (41Lin F.-T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Google Scholar). This is thought to be critical for interaction with clathrin but not for uncoupling the receptor from signaling. In this study we demonstrate that βarr1 is required for rapid PAR1 desensitization but not for internalization through clathrin-coated pits. Thus, it is possible that upon PAR1 activation βarr1 is recruited to the receptor but fails to undergo dephosphorylation and is, therefore, unable to promote receptor interaction with clathrin. This possibility remains to be tested. In addition to arrestins, AP-2 can function as an adaptor to recruit receptor tyrosine kinases and other membrane proteins to clathrin-coated pits (42Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Google Scholar); whether AP-2 functions in PAR1 internalization is not known.In summary, mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from β-arrestin knockouts provided an opportunity to assess arrestin function in PAR1 signaling and trafficking. These studies show that βarr1 functions as the predominant regulator of PAR1 desensitization and strongly suggest that the individual β-arrestin isoforms can differentially regulate GPCR desensitization. Moreover, these studies reveal a novel arrestin-independent mechanism for PAR1 internalization from the plasma membrane. The challenge now is to elucidate the mechanisms by which activated PAR1 is recruited to clathrin-coated pits and internalized from the plasma membrane; an event critical for termination of receptor signaling (18Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Google Scholar, 19Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Google Scholar). Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR11), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for thrombin, is the prototype member of a family of protease-activated receptors. PAR1 couples to Gq, Gi, and G12/13 to elicit a variety of signaling events important for hemostasis, thrombosis, and embryonic development (1Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Google Scholar, 2Griffin C.T. Srinivasan Y. Zheng Y.-W. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. Science. 2001; 293: 1666-1670Google Scholar). PAR1 is activated by thrombin through an unusual proteolytic mechanism. Thrombin, a serine protease, binds to and cleaves the extracellular amino terminus of PAR1 (3Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Google Scholar). The newly formed amino terminus of PAR1 then functions as a tethered peptide ligand by interacting with the receptor to trigger signaling (3Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

Despite PAR1's irreversible proteolytic mechanism of activation and the generation of a tethered ligand that cannot diffuse away, signaling by the receptor is rapidly terminated at the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanisms responsible for termination of PAR1 signaling are not clearly understood. The molecular mechanisms responsible for GPCR desensitization and resensitization have been extensively studied for the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) (6Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Google Scholar, 7Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Google Scholar). In this model GPCRs are initially desensitized by rapid phosphorylation of the activated form of the receptor by G protein-coupled kinases (GRKs). Phosphorylated receptor then binds arrestin, which impedes interaction with G proteins. Arrestin also facilitates GPCR internalization by interacting with clathrin and the adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2), components of the endocytic machinery (8Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Google Scholar, 9Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Google Scholar). Once internalized into endosomes, receptor dissociates from the ligand, becomes dephosphorylated, and is then recycled back to the plasma membrane ready for activation again. Phosphorylation of activated PAR1 initiates rapid desensitization and internalization from the plasma membrane. Overexpression of GRK3 and GRK5 enhances PAR1 phosphorylation and markedly inhibits PAR1 signaling (10Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1125-1130Google Scholar, 11Tiruppathi C. Yan W. Sandoval R. Naqvi T. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Malik A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7440-7445Google Scholar). Activation of PAR1 cytoplasmic tail mutants that were not phosphorylated signaled more robustly than wild-type PAR1 (12Nanevicz T. Wang L. Chen M. Ishii M. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 702-706Google Scholar, 13Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Google Scholar). Moreover, these same mutants also failed to exhibit agonist-triggered internalization. Interestingly, a cytoplasmic tail mutant of PAR1 with limited alanine substitution for serines between residues 391 and 406 is phosphorylated but defective in its ability to uncouple from signaling (14Hammes S.R. Shapiro M.J. Coughlin S.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Google Scholar). This same receptor mutant is internalized following activation like wild-type PAR1. Together, these findings suggest that phosphorylation of PAR1's cytoplasmic tail is important for both rapid desensitization and internalization, however, distinct mechanisms may regulate these processes. Internalization and lysosomal sorting of activated PAR1 is also important for termination of receptor signaling. Activated PAR1 is internalized through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway, like many recycling receptors (15Hoxie J.A. Ahuja M. Belmonte E. Pizarro S. Parton R. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13756-13763Google Scholar, 16Trejo J. Altschuler Y. Fu H.-W. Mostov K.E. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31255-31265Google Scholar). Once internalized, PAR1 is sorted away from recycling receptors and targeted to lysosomes for degradation; an event critical for termination of receptor signaling (17Hein L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27719-27726Google Scholar, 18Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Google Scholar, 19Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Google Scholar). In transfected fibroblasts, a mutant PAR1 able to internalize and recycle to the cell surface signaled persistently after activation by thrombin (19Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Google Scholar). This prolonged signaling is apparently due to recycling and continued signaling by receptors that return to the plasma membrane with their tethered ligands intact. Thus, phosphorylation of activated PAR1 promotes rapid desensitization at the plasma membrane while internalization and lysosomal sorting prevents the receptor from recycling and continuing to signal on the cell surface. The β-arrestin isoforms 1 and 2 are widely expressed and bind to phosphorylated GPCRs to mediate desensitization and internalization (20Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharm. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PAR1 is important for desensitization and internalization, however, the role of arrestins in signaling and trafficking of PAR1 is not known. In this study, we investigate the function of arrestin in PAR1 signaling and trafficking through the use of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from β-arrestin (βarr) knockouts (21Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar). Our findings strongly suggest that βarr1 functions as the predominant regulator of PAR1 desensitization. Moreover, these studies reveal a novel mechanism by which GPCRs can internalize through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway that is independent of β-arrestins. DISCUSSIONPAR1's proteolytic mechanism of activation is clearly distinct from that of most GPCRs and raises questions regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for termination of PAR1 signaling. Phosphorylation of activated PAR1 is important for both rapid termination of receptor signaling and internalization from the plasma membrane (12Nanevicz T. Wang L. Chen M. Ishii M. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 702-706Google Scholar, 13Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Google Scholar). Many phosphorylated GPCRs bind arrestins, which uncouple the receptor from signaling and facilitate receptor internalization (20Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharm. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Google Scholar). The role of arrestins in the regulation of PAR1 signaling and trafficking has not previously been determined. Prior studies have used heterologous overexpression of wild-type and dominant-negative forms of arrestin to assess function; however, such studies are often complicated by the expression of endogenous protein. Our recent generation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from β-arrestin knockouts offered an opportunity to assess function in cells in which the expression of the individual arrestin isoforms was eliminated genetically by gene knockout (21Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar). We therefore assessed signaling and trafficking of PAR1 in cells that lack either one or both isoforms of β-arrestin.PAR1 is endogenously expressed in MEFs, and thrombin signaling is completely abolished in MEFs derived from PAR1 knockout mice, thus PAR1 is the predominant mediator of thrombin signaling in these cells (38Connolly A.J. Ishihara H. Kahn M.L. Farese R.V. Coughlin S.R. Nature. 1996; 381: 516-519Google Scholar). In cells lacking both β-arrestin isoforms (βarr1,2−/−) endogenous PAR1 signaling was significantly more robust than wild-type controls. Consistent with these results, in transfected MEFs expressing similar amounts of PAR1, the rate of PAR1 desensitization was significantly slowed, resulting in a greater accumulation of inositol phosphates in β-arrestin knockouts compared with wild-type control cells. Thus, in the absence of β-arrestins, desensitization of PAR1 signaling is significantly impaired. To our knowledge these findings are the first to demonstrate a role for β-arrestins in regulation of PAR1 signaling. Moreover, in cells that lack only βarr1, the rate of PAR1 desensitization was markedly impaired compared with βarr2 lacking cells and wild-type controls. These results strongly suggest that the βarr1 isoform functions as the predominant regulator of PAR1 desensitization. These findings contrast with our recent report in which both β-arrestin isoforms were found to be equally effective in regulating desensitization of β2-AR and AT1A-R using these same knockout cells (21Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar). Thus, these studies provide the first example in which the β-arrestin isoforms can differentially regulate GPCR desensitization.In addition to regulating GPCR desensitization, β-arrestins can facilitate GPCR internalization. Arrestins bind phosphorylated GPCRs and interact with clathrin and the adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2) to promote receptor internalization (8Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Google Scholar, 9Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Google Scholar). PAR1 requires phosphorylation for internalization through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway (13Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Google Scholar, 16Trejo J. Altschuler Y. Fu H.-W. Mostov K.E. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31255-31265Google Scholar), raising the possibility that arrestin might function in this process. In contrast, we found that activated PAR1 is internalized through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway even when both β-arrestin isoforms are absent. Constitutive internalization of PAR1 was also intact in β-arrestin knockout cells. Interestingly, PAR1 internalization required phosphorylation even in the absence of β-arrestins. Together, these findings are consistent with a distinct phosphorylation-dependent but arrestin-independent pathway for PAR1 internalization. By contrast, the β2-AR failed to internalize in these same β-arrestin knockout cells. The β2-AR is known to bind arrestin and internalize through a classic dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway (39Ferguson S.S. Downey W.r. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Google Scholar). Thus, the failure of β2-AR to internalize in β-arrestin knockout cells that show robust PAR1 internalization suggests that these receptors have distinct requirements for internalization through clathrin-coated pits. Together, these studies provide strong evidence for a novel mechanism by which GPCRs can internalize through a dynamin- and clathrin-dependent pathway that is independent of arrestins.The relative contributions of receptor uncoupling via phosphorylation and arrestin binding versus receptor internalization to the rapid termination of PAR1 signaling remain poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that, in the absence of β-arrestins, rapid desensitization of PAR1 signaling is markedly impaired while internalization remains intact. Thus, internalization is not required for rapid desensitization of PAR1 signaling. In many cases, arrestins can mediate both desensitization and internalization of GPCRs (21Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar); our observations, however, are consistent with a distinct arrestin-independent mechanism for PAR1 internalization. This is also consistent with a recent report in which termination of PAR1 signaling and internalization were separated by mutation of phosphorylation sites within PAR1's cytoplasmic tail (14Hammes S.R. Shapiro M.J. Coughlin S.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Google Scholar). Similar mutants have been reported for the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (40Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasienski J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Google Scholar). In cells lacking arrestins PAR1 signaling was eventually slowed; this may be due to internalization and lysosomal sorting of activated PAR1. Indeed, a mutant PAR1 that internalized and recycled back to the cell surface signaled persistently following activation by thrombin (19Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Google Scholar). These studies strongly suggest that internalization and lysosomal sorting are critical for termination of PAR1 signaling (18Trejo J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2216-2224Google Scholar, 19Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Google Scholar). Thus, β-arrestin is required for rapid desensitization of PAR1 signaling, whereas internalization and lysosomal sorting appear to contribute to termination of PAR1 signaling observed at later times.Internalization of GPCRs through clathrin-coated pits is a multistep process involving numerous proteins. β-Arrestins bind to clathrin and the adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2) and thereby link phosphorylated GPCRs to the endocytic machinery (8Goodman Jr., O.B.

Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon recruitment to activated receptors, βarr1 undergoes dephosphorylation at a carboxyl-terminal serine residue (41Lin F.-T. Krueger K.M. Kendall H.E. Daaka Y. Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31051-31057Google Scholar). This is thought to be critical for interaction with clathrin but not for uncoupling the receptor from signaling. In this study we demonstrate that βarr1 is required for rapid PAR1 desensitization but not for internalization through clathrin-coated pits. Thus, it is possible that upon PAR1 activation βarr1 is recruited to the receptor but fails to undergo dephosphorylation and is, therefore, unable to promote receptor interaction with clathrin. This possibility remains to be tested. In addition to arrestins, AP-2 can function as an adaptor to recruit receptor tyrosine kinases and other membrane proteins to clathrin-coated pits (42Kirchhausen T. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 705-732Google Scholar); whether AP-2 functions in PAR1 internalization is not known.In summary, mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from β-arrestin knockouts provided an opportunity to assess arrestin function in PAR1 signaling and trafficking.

https://openalex.org/W2024449044,"Increasing evidence suggests that α-synuclein is a common pathogenic molecule in several neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Parkinson's disease. To understand α-synuclein pathology, we investigated molecules that interact with α-synuclein in human and rat brains and identified tubulin as an α-synuclein binding/associated protein. Tubulin co-localized with α-synuclein in Lewy bodies and other α-synuclein-positive pathological structures. Tubulin initiated and promoted α-synuclein fibril formation under physiological conditions in vitro. These findings suggest that an interaction between tubulin and α-synuclein might accelerate α-synuclein aggregation in diseased brains, leading to the formation of Lewy bodies."

Here, we report that Arabidopsis as well as other plant species contain two genes, DGD1 and DGD2, encoding enzymes with DGDG synthase activity. Using MGDG and UDP-galactose as substrates for in vitro assays with DGD2 we could for the first time measure DGDG synthase activity of a heterologously expressed plant cDNA. UDP-galactose, but not MGDG, serves as the galactose donor for DGDG synthesis catalyzed by DGD2, providing clear evidence for the existence of a UDP-galactose-dependent DGDG synthase in higher plants. In in vitro assays, DGD2 was capable of galactosylating DGDG, resulting in the synthesis of an oligogalactolipid tentatively identified as trigalactosyldiacylglycerol. DGD2 mRNA expression in leaves was very low but was strongly induced during growth under phosphate-limiting conditions. This induction correlates with the previously described increase in DGDG during phosphate deprivation. Therefore, in contrast to DGD1, which is responsible for the synthesis of the bulk of DGDG found in chloroplasts, DGD2 apparently is involved in the synthesis of DGDG under specific growth conditions. The galactolipid digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), one of the main chloroplast lipids in higher plants, is believed to be synthesized by the galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase, which transfers a galactose moiety from one molecule of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) to another. Here, we report that Arabidopsis as well as other plant species contain two genes, DGD1 and DGD2, encoding enzymes with DGDG synthase activity. Using MGDG and UDP-galactose as substrates for in vitro assays with DGD2 we could for the first time measure DGDG synthase activity of a heterologously expressed plant cDNA.

Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 263-285Google Scholar). These galactolipids are highly abundant in thylakoids, intricate membrane systems in chloroplasts containing the complexes of photosystem I and photosystem II. For a long time the elucidation of the biosynthesis of plant galactolipids has proven extremely difficult. Biochemical labeling experiments with chloroplast membranes suggested that MGDG and DGDG are synthesized by sequential galactosylation of diacylglycerol (e.g. Refs. 4Neufeld E.F. Hall C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 14: 503-508Google Scholar and 5Ongun A. Mudd J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1558-1566Google Scholar). Only in the recent past, the first genes encoding MGDG synthase and DGDG synthase were isolated (for reviews see Ref. 6Jorasch P. Heinz E. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 469-471Google Scholar and Footnote 2). InArabidopsis thaliana, three genes (MGD1,MGD2, MGD3) are known encoding MGDG synthases. The corresponding enzymes transfer a galactose moiety from UDP-galactose to diacylglycerol (8Shimojima M. Ohta H. Iwamatsu A. Masuda T. Shioi Y. Takamiya K.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10960-10965Google Scholar). The synthesis of DGDG in plants is assumed to involve the galactosylation of MGDG by the galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.184; Refs. 12van Besouw A. Wintermans J.F.G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 44-53Google Scholarand 13Heemskerk J.W.M. Strorz T. Schmidt R.R. Heinz E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1286-1294Google Scholar). Biochemical studies with spinach envelope membranes suggested that another MGDG molecule, but not UDP-galactose, is used as the galactose donor for DGDG synthesis.The isolation of Arabidopsis mutants deficient in MGDG or DGDG has advanced our current understanding of the biosynthesis and function of galactolipids in higher plants (14Dörmann P. Hoffmann-Benning S. Balbo I. Benning C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1801-1810Google Scholar, 15Jarvis P. Dörmann P. Peto C.A. Lutes J. Benning C. Chory J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8175-8179Google Scholar). MGDG and DGDG were found to be critical for functional intactness of the complexes of photosystems I and II (14Dörmann P. Hoffmann-Benning S. Balbo I. Benning C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1801-1810Google Scholar, 15Jarvis P. Dörmann P. Peto C.A. Lutes J. Benning C. Chory J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Grimm B. Benning C. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1175-1184Google Scholar). By complementation of the DGDG-deficient dgd1 mutant, the first gene encoding a DGDG synthase was isolated (18Dörmann P. Balbo I. Benning C. Science. 1999; 284: 2181-2184Google Scholar). This gene, DGD1, is critical for synthesis of the bulk amount of DGDG found in chloroplasts (14Dörmann P. Hoffmann-Benning S. Balbo I. Benning C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1801-1810Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence point to the direction that inArabidopsis, besides DGD1, at least one additional enzyme is involved in the synthesis of DGDG as follows. (i) The dgd1mutant, which presumably represents a null mutation caused by the introduction of a premature stop codon into the coding region of theDGD1 gene, still contains residual amounts of DGDG (18Dörmann P. Balbo I. Benning C. Science. 1999; 284: 2181-2184Google Scholar). (ii) Chloroplasts isolated from dgd1 plants were capable of synthesizing DGDG in similar amounts as compared with wild type (14Dörmann P. Hoffmann-Benning S. Balbo I. Benning C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1801-1810Google Scholar). 3D. Klaus, H. Härtel, L. Fitzpatrick, J. Froehlich, J. Hubert, C. Benning, and P. Dörmann, submitted for publication. 3D. Klaus, H. Härtel, L. Fitzpatrick, J. Froehlich, J. Hubert, C. Benning, and P. Dörmann, submitted for publication. (iii) Upon phosphate deprivation, wild type and dgd1 mutant plants accumulate high amounts of DGDG (20Härtel H. Dörmann P. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10649-10654Google Scholar). The additional amount of DGDG produced during phosphate deprivation was suggested to be associated with the chloroplast as well as with extraplastidic membranes, where it presumably substitutes for phospholipids.In Arabidopsis as well as in many other plants (so-called 16:3 plants), the two galactolipids MGDG and DGDG differ with regard to their fatty acid composition. MGDG, which is mostly derived from diacylglycerol assembled inside the chloroplast (“prokaryotic-type lipid”), is rich in hexadecatrienoic acid (16:3), whereas DGDG contains fatty acids originating from the endoplasmic reticulum and, thus, is enriched in α-linolenic acid (18:3) (“eukaryotic type lipid”) but devoid of 16:3 (3Vijayan P. Routaboul J.-M. Browse J. Lipids in Photosynthesis: Structure, Function, and Genetics. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 263-285Google Scholar, 21Browse J. Warwick N. Somerville C.R. Slack C.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 25-31Google Scholar). In contrast, only the eukaryotic lipid synthesis pathway seems to be operational in the group of 18:3 plants. The difference between these two pathways may be explained by distinct substrate specificities or by different locations of the enzymes involved in galactolipid synthesis in the envelope membranes. In fact, MGD1 from spinach and Arabidopsis was not specific for different diacylglycerol substrates and was localized to the inner chloroplast envelope (9Miège C. Maréchal E. Shimojima M. Awai K. Block M.A. Ohta H. Takamiya K.-i. Douce R. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 990-1001Google Scholar), whereas MGD2 and MGD3 fromArabidopsis were highly active with eukaryotic type substrate and may be localized to the outer envelope (11Awai K. Maréchal E. Block M.A. Brun D. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K.-i. Ohta H. Joyard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10960-10965Google Scholar). The DGD1 protein as well as the galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase activity was localized to the outer chloroplast envelope (22Dorne A.-J. Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1982; 145: 30-34Google Scholar, 23Cline K. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1983; 71: 366-372Google Scholar, 24Froehlich J. Benning C. Dörmann P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31806-31812Google Scholar).On chromosome 4 of the Arabidopsis genome, a second putative DGDG synthase gene tentatively designated DGD2 was identified based on high sequence similarity to DGD1 (18Dörmann P. Balbo I. Benning C. Science. 1999; 284: 2181-2184Google Scholar). We isolated the corresponding cDNA from Arabidopsis for functional analysis of enzyme activity and substrate specificity after heterologous expression in Escherichia coli to test whether this gene encodes a second DGDG synthase and to unravel its relation to the galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase activity. Furthermore, we analyzed DGD2 expression during phosphate deprivation to address the question of whether DGD2 might be involved in regulation of DGDG synthesis during growth under phosphate-limiting conditions.DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence suggest that in addition to DGD1, at least one further DGDG synthase activity exists inArabidopsis (14Dörmann P. Hoffmann-Benning S. Balbo I. Benning C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1801-1810Google Scholar, 20Härtel H. Dörmann P. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10649-10654Google Scholar).3 Indeed, in this study a second cDNA (DGD2) was isolated fromArabidopsis encoding a functionally active DGDG synthase. The amino acid sequence of DGD2 was very similar to the C-terminal, glycosyltransferase-like part of DGD1 (Fig. 1, A andB). The N-terminal part of DGD1, which is missing in DGD2, was recently shown to be involved in the targeting of the DGD1 protein to the outer envelope of chloroplasts (24Froehlich J. Benning C. Dörmann P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31806-31812Google Scholar). Because this part of the DGD1 sequence is not present in DGD2, it apparently is dispensable for DGDG synthase activity. The fact that no sequences similar to DGD1 or DGD2 are present in the cyanobacterial genome (40Takakazu K. Satoshi T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1997; 38: 1171-1176Google Scholar) suggests that DGDG synthase genes in higher plants have evolved independently from lipid biosynthesis of the endosymbiont. However, the close similarity of the two plant DGDG synthases to glycosyltransferases of primary metabolism (e.g. sucrose synthase, sucrose-phosphate synthase) might indicate that the two genes were derived from primary metabolism of the plant host or the endosymbiont. For many plant species, both a DGD1-like and a DGD2-like EST sequence were found in GenBankTM (Fig. 1C). It has been speculated that the different lipid synthesis pathways present in 16:3 and 18:3 plants (eukaryotic/prokaryotic pathway) might be related to the presence of different isoforms of enzymes of galactolipid synthesis (e.g. Refs. 21Browse J. Warwick N. Somerville C.R. Slack C.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 25-31Google Scholar and 41Heinz E. Roughan P.G. Plant Physiol. 1983; 72: 273-279Google Scholar). However, because ESTs similar to DGD1 as well as DGD2 were present in both 16:3 and 18:3 plants, it is unlikely that the DGDG synthase genes are responsible for differences in galactolipid synthesis between these groups of plants. Similarly, Awai et al. (11Awai K. Maréchal E. Block M.A. Brun D. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K.-i. Ohta H. Joyard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10960-10965Google Scholar) showed that the two major types of MGDG synthase genes found in Arabidopsis (type A, MGD1; type B, MGD2/MGD3) are found in both 16:3 and 18:3 plants.By measuring DGDG synthesis with recombinant DGD2 using MGDG and UDP-galactose as substrates, we could for the first time determinein vitro DGDG synthase activity of a heterologously expressed plant cDNA (Figs. 4 and 5). In addition to the detergent and lipid substrates employed (MGDG or DGDG), the DGDG synthase assays contained proteins and lipids normally found in E. colimembranes. If, similar to DGD1 (24Froehlich J. Benning C. Dörmann P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31806-31812Google Scholar), DGD2 was also localized to the chloroplast envelope, the DGD2 activity might depend on the presence of additional lipids of the envelope membranes. In contrast to E. coli, which is rich in phospholipids (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin), chloroplast envelopes contain the glycolipids MGDG, DGDG, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol as well as the phospholipids PG and phosphatidylcholine (2Maréchal E. Block M.A. Dorne A.-J. Douce R. Joyard J. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 65-77Google Scholar). However, no stimulating effect was observed after the addition of phosphatidylcholine or DGDG, suggesting that DGD2 does not require interaction with these lipids for activation of enzyme activity.Because DGDG synthase activity with MGDG isolated from wild type (mostly prokaryotic type MGDG) was very similar as compared with MGDG from the act1 mutant (eukaryotic type MGDG), DGD2 does not exhibit strong preference for prokaryotic or eukaryotic substrates. Siebertz and Heinz (42Siebertz H.P. Heinz E. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1977; 358: 27-34Google Scholar) showed that the galactosylation of different MGDG forms by protein extracts from pea leaves was dependent on the total numbers of double bonds in the two fatty acid chains of MGDG. It was concluded that differences in molecular species composition of MGDG and DGDG in mature plants are not related to substrate specificity of the DGDG synthase. Similarly, no specificity for eukaryotic or prokaryotic diacylglycerol was observed for MGD1 of spinach or Arabidopsis (9Miège C. Maréchal E. Shimojima M. Awai K. Block M.A. Ohta H. Takamiya K.-i. Douce R. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 990-1001Google Scholar, 15Jarvis P. Dörmann P. Peto C.A. Lutes J. Benning C. Chory J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8175-8179Google Scholar). MGD2 and MGD3, however, showed higher activity with eukaryotic type diacylglycerol. The eukaryotic form of MGDG synthesized by MGD2 and MGD3 supposedly accumulates in the outer chloroplast envelope (11Awai K. Maréchal E. Block M.A. Brun D. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K.-i. Ohta H. Joyard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10960-10965Google Scholar), where it might serve as the substrate for DGDG synthesis. Therefore, the accumulation of eukaryotic type DGDG in Arabidopsis apparently is determined on the level of the synthesis of its precursor, MGDG.Labeling studies with isolated spinach chloroplasts indicated that DGDG synthesis catalyzed by the galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase includes the transfer of one galactose moiety from one MGDG molecule to another (Fig.7, dotted arrow; Refs. 12van Besouw A. Wintermans J.F.G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 44-53Google Scholar, 13Heemskerk J.W.M. Strorz T. Schmidt R.R. Heinz E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1286-1294Google Scholar, and 43Heemskerk J.W.M. Bögemann G. Helsper J.P.F.G. Wintermans J.F.G.M. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 971-977Google Scholar). In contrast, many other glycosylation reactions in plants, including MGDG synthesis, were shown to be dependent on UDP sugars. In pea chloroplasts, Siebertz and Heinz (42Siebertz H.P. Heinz E. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1977; 358: 27-34Google Scholar) measured DGDG synthesis with MGDG and UDP-galactose. However, analyzing a variety of plant species including 16:3 and 18:3 plants (e.g. spinach, tobacco, corn, pea), Heemskerk et al. (13Heemskerk J.W.M. Strorz T. Schmidt R.R. Heinz E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1286-1294Google Scholar) could not find biochemical evidence for this alternative UDP-galactose-dependent galactosylation reaction (Fig. 7, solid arrow). In Fig. 4, we demonstrated that DGD2 was dependent on UDP-galactose, because DGDG synthesis could not be established with MGDG as the sole donor and acceptor for galactose. Therefore, in contrast to previous studies (e.g. Refs. 12van Besouw A. Wintermans J.F.G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 44-53Google Scholar, 13Heemskerk J.W.M. Strorz T. Schmidt R.R. Heinz E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1286-1294Google Scholar, and 43Heemskerk J.W.M. Bögemann G. Helsper J.P.F.G. Wintermans J.F.G.M. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 971-977Google Scholar), this result clearly demonstrates that Arabidopsis contains a UDP-galactose-dependent DGDG synthase. Furthermore, other enzymes of galactolipid synthesis (e.g. DGD1) might be responsible for the galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase activity detectable in isolated chloroplasts. The transfer of one galactose from one MGDG molecule to another (Fig. 7, dotted line) would require the inversion of the anomeric carbon of the second galactose moiety, because its configuration would have to be changed from β in MGDG to α in DGDG. However, as demonstrated in this study, the transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose to MGDG as catalyzed by DGD2 (Fig. 7, solid arrow) involves retention of the α-configuration of the second galactose group (cf.Fig. 3). The retention of the anomeric configuration is in accordance with classification systems of plant glycosyltransferases developed by and Campbell et al. (44Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-942Google Scholar) and Henrissat and Davies (45Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1515-1519Google Scholar). Enzymes that fall into the same family not only share a high degree of sequence similarity but exhibit similar structural characteristics and follow the same glycosyltransferase mechanism. The DGDG synthases DGD1 and DGD2 can be assigned to the family GT4 containing glycosyltransferases of primary metabolism (45Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1515-1519Google Scholar). Enzymes of this class were shown to transfer sugar moieties with retention of the anomeric configuration. The sequence similarity of DGD2 to these glycosyltransferases is in accordance with the finding that DGD2 encodes a UDP-galactose-dependent DGDG synthase that transfers galactose to MGDG with retention of the α-anomeric configuration.After incubation of DGD2 with MGDG or DGDG and radioactive UDP-galactose, we observed the synthesis of a radioactive lipid co-migrating with TriGDG. This oligogalactolipid, which is present in plants in very low amounts, was found to accumulate in isolated chloroplast envelopes (22Dorne A.-J. Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1982; 145: 30-34Google Scholar, 43Heemskerk J.W.M. Bögemann G. Helsper J.P.F.G. Wintermans J.F.G.M. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 971-977Google Scholar) as well as in tissues of some plant species (39Kojima M. Seki K. Ohnishi M. Ito S. Fujino Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 59-64Google Scholar). Similarly, bacterial enzymes involved in diglucosyldiacylglycerol synthesis in Bacillus andStaphylococcus were shown to produce glycolipids with three or four glucose molecules in their head group after expression inE. coli (10Jorasch P. Warnecke D.C. Lindner B. Zähringer U. Heinz E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3770-3783Google Scholar, 46Jorasch P. Wolter F.P. Zähringer Y. Heinz E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 419-431Google Scholar). The “processive” galactosylation activity of DGD2 was only found in highly active enzyme preparations and was rapidly lost upon dilution or nickel affinity chromatography (Fig. 4). Furthermore, TriGDG did not accumulate in E. colicells co-expressing cucumber MGD1 and Arabidopsis DGD2 (Fig.2). Therefore, the processive activity was not detectable in intactE. coli cells expressing DGD2, but only after cell rupture and detergent solubilization was the synthesis of TriGDG observed inin vitro assays. Similarly, lipid extracts from whole leaf tissue or from fresh preparations of intact chloroplasts are low in oligogalactolipids. However, they accumulate to high amounts in isolated chloroplast envelopes (22Dorne A.-J. Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1982; 145: 30-34Google Scholar, 43Heemskerk J.W.M. Bögemann G. Helsper J.P.F.G. Wintermans J.F.G.M. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 971-977Google Scholar, 47Joyard J. Douce R. The Biochemistry of Plants. 9. Academic Press, Inc., New York1987: 215-274Google Scholar) as well as during protoplastation of leaves, which was shown to affect polar and neutral lipid composition (19Browse J. Somerville C.R. Slack C.R. Plant Sci. 1988; 56: 15-20Google Scholar).3We repeatedly observed radioactive labeling of DGDG in DGD2 assays using nonradioactive DGDG and 14C-UDP-galactose (Fig. 4,lane 8). The incorporation of radioactivity from UDP-galactose into DGDG was dependent on the presence of DGD2 protein, because no radioactive DGDG band was detected in assays with empty vector control (Fig. 4, lane 9). Furthermore, no radioactive MGDG lipid accumulated after incubating a protein extract of empty vector control cells with 14C-DGDG (data not shown), indicating that DGDG was not hydrolyzed to MGDG by a galactosidase activity derived from the E. coli protein extract. Incorporation of radioactivity into DGDG might be explained by a head group exchange reaction, where one galactose group of DGDG is released in a reverse DGD2 reaction, resulting in synthesis of MGDG, which might rapidly be re-galactosylated with radioactive UDP-galactose. Previously, glycosyltransferases were shown to be capable of catalyzing the sugar transfer in two directions depending on the relative concentrations of substrates and products (7Sinnot M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Google Scholar).The identification of DGD2 as a second, DGD1-independent DGDG synthase in Arabidopsis and presumably also in many higher plants leaves us with the question of the exact function of this additional enzyme in plant lipid metabolism. Based on the very low DGD2 expression level in plants grown under normal conditions (Fig. 6) and on the fact that a mutation in DGD1 leads to a 90% reduction of DGDG in chloroplasts (14Dörmann P. Hoffmann-Benning S. Balbo I. Benning C. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1801-1810Google Scholar), one has to conclude that DGD1 and not DGD2 represents the enzyme responsible for synthesizing the predominant fraction of DGDG in chloroplasts. The strong DGD2 mRNA induction and increase of DGDG synthesis after phosphate deprivation (20Härtel H. Dörmann P. Benning C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10649-10654Google Scholar) suggests that DGD2 is involved in synthesizing DGDG during phosphate deprivation. Recently, Awai et al. (11Awai K. Maréchal E. Block M.A. Brun D. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K.-i. Ohta H. Joyard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10960-10965Google Scholar) demonstrated that the MGDG synthase genes MGD2 and MGD3 of Arabidopsis are induced by phosphate deprivation. Therefore, during growth under phosphate-limiting conditions, several enzymes of galactolipid biosynthesis are induced that finally results in massive DGDG production. The finding that DGD2 represents a UDP-galactose-dependent DGDG synthase induced by phosphate starvation raises the question of the exact reaction mechanism of DGD1 and its role during growth under phosphate-limiting conditions. The additional N-terminal part present in DGD1 might not only be critical for protein targeting (cf. Ref. 24Froehlich J. Benning C. Dörmann P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31806-31812Google Scholar) but may as well be involved in modifying enzyme activity or substrate specificity. Further experiments are therefore required to elucidate the exact contribution of the two different DGDG synthase pathways as well as the intracellular location and transport of galactolipids in higher plants. In contrast to animals, yeast, and many bacteria, plant membranes contain high amounts of the two galactolipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG)1 and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) (1Joyard J. Block M.A. Malherbe A. Maréchal E. Douce R. Lipid Metabolism in Higher Plants. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1993: 231-258Google Scholar, 2Maréchal E. Block M.A. Dorne A.-J. Douce R. Joyard J. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 65-77Google Scholar, 3Vijayan P. Routaboul J.-M. Browse J. Lipids in Photosynthesis: Structure, Function, and Genetics. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 263-285Google Scholar). These galactolipids are highly abundant in thylakoids, intricate membrane systems in chloroplasts containing the complexes of photosystem I and photosystem II. For a long time the elucidation of the biosynthesis of plant galactolipids has proven extremely difficult. Biochemical labeling experiments with chloroplast membranes suggested that MGDG and DGDG are synthesized by sequential galactosylation of diacylglycerol (e.g. Refs. 4Neufeld E.F. Hall C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1964; 14: 503-508Google Scholar and 5Ongun A. Mudd J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1558-1566Google Scholar). Only in the recent past, the first genes encoding MGDG synthase and DGDG synthase were isolated (for reviews see Ref. 6Jorasch P. Heinz E. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 469-471Google Scholar and Footnote 2). InArabidopsis thaliana, three genes (MGD1,MGD2, MGD3) are known encoding MGDG synthases. The corresponding enzymes transfer a galactose moiety from UDP-galactose to diacylglycerol (8Shimojima M. Ohta H. Iwamatsu A. Masuda T. Shioi Y. Takamiya K.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10960-10965Google Scholar). The synthesis of DGDG in plants is assumed to involve the galactosylation of MGDG by the galactolipid:galactolipid galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.184; Refs. 12van Besouw A. Wintermans J.F.G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 529: 44-53Google Scholarand 13Heemskerk J.W.M. Strorz T. Schmidt R.R. Heinz E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1286-1294Google Scholar). Biochemical studies with spinach envelope membranes suggested that another MGDG molecule, but not UDP-galactose, is used as the galactose donor for DGDG synthesis. The isolation of Arabidopsis mutants deficient in MGDG or DGDG has advanced our current understanding of the biosynthesis and function of galactolipids in higher plants (14Dörmann P.

Grimm B. Benning C. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1175-1184Google Scholar). By complementation of the DGDG-deficient dgd1 mutant, the first gene encoding a DGDG synthase was isolated (18Dörmann P. Balbo I. Benning C. Science. 1999; 284: 2181-2184Google Scholar). This gene, DGD1, is critical for synthesis of the bulk amount of DGDG found in chloroplasts (14Dörmann P. Hoffmann-Benning S.

Uremia or humoral factors are not responsible for the protection, since unilateral UO confers protection on that kidney but not the contralateral kidney. Prior UO results in reduced postischemic outer medullary congestion and leukocyte infiltration. Prior UO results in reduced postischemic phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal stress-activated protein kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2), p38, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 4 (MKK4), and MKK3/6. Very few cells stain positively for proliferating cell nuclear antigen after obstruction, indicating that subsequent protection against ischemia is not related to proliferation with increased numbers of newly formed daughter cells more resistant to injury. UO increases the expression of heat shock protein (HSP)-25 and HSP-72. The increased HSP-25 expression persists for 6 or 8 days, whereas HSP-72 does not. HSP-25 expression is increased in the proximal tubule cells in the outer stripe of the outer medulla postobstruction, prior to, and 24 h after ischemia. In LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells, adenovirus-expressed human HSP-27 confers resistance to chemical anoxia and oxidative stress. Increased HSP-27 expression in LLC-PK1 cells results in reduced H2O2-induced phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38. In conclusion, prior transient UO renders the kidney resistant to ischemia. This resistance to functional consequences of ischemia is associated with reduced postischemic activation of JNK, p38 MAP kinases, and their upstream MAPK kinases. The persistent increase in HSP-25 that occurs as a result of UO may contribute to the reduction in phosphorylation of MAPKs that have been implicated in adhesion molecule up-regulation and cell death.

Recently, we observed in kidney that the acquired resistance persists for at least 15 days and is associated with a reduced activation of the JNK1 and p38 MAPKs and their upstream MAPK kinases (5Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Renal ischemia causes tubular necrosis, and the damaged tubular cells are replaced by regenerating cells. Since dividing cells are less susceptible to oxidative stress than quiescent cells (6Zou X. Tsutsui T. Ray D. Blomquist J.F. Ichijo H. Ucker D.S. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4818-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and the aged heart is more susceptible to ischemic-induced DNA damage than the young heart (7Liu L. Azhar G. Gao W. Zhang X. Wei J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R315-R322PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that epithelial cell regeneration may explain resistance to ischemia. To gain insight into mechanisms responsible for the protection observed with preconditioning, we evaluated whether other interventions that did not result in mitogenesis could protect the kidney against ischemia. Transient ureteral obstruction can result in renal failure in the absence of tubular necrosis (8Nagle R.B. Johnson M.E. Jervis H.R. Lab. Invest. 1976; 35: 18-22PubMed Google Scholar). Zager (9Zager R.A. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 628-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) has reported that proximal tubular segments, isolated 24 h after ureteral ligation, are resistant to hypoxia/reoxygenation injury. This protection did not correlate with tubular proliferation (as determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining) and was without any observed changes in HSP-70 or antioxidant enzyme expression (9Zager R.A. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 628-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for preconditioning remain poorly understood. Since ischemic acute renal failure continues to be associated with a very high mortality rate in humans, it is important to understand how the kidney uses endogenous processes to protect itself. With this understanding, it might be possible to mimic these processes using exogenous influences and hence prevent and/or alter the course of the disease. We characterized the protection afforded by ureteral obstruction in the intact kidney and explored potential mechanisms responsible for the protection.Prior heat shock confers cytoprotection against ischemia or ATP depletion in many organs and cultured cells (10Borkan S.C.

Prior heat shock has been shown to both activate these kinases in organs and isolated mammalian cells and suppress their activation in the presence of other stresses (28Gabai V.L. Yaglom J.A.

HSP-27 is a terminal substrate of the p38 MAPK cascade and is phosphorylated by activation of MAPK-activated protein kinases 2/3 (30Huot J. Houle F. Marceau F. Landry J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar).We examined whether the protective effect of prior ureteral obstruction is associated with expression of HSP-25 and/or activation of the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK pathways. We report that prior transient ureteral obstruction protects the kidney against remote ischemia, and the protection correlates with persistent up-regulation of HSP-25 in the S3 proximal tubular cells of the outer stripe of the outer medulla, reduced postischemic leukocyte infiltration, and reduced postischemic activation of JNK1/2 and p38 signal pathway cascades. Furthermore, exogenous expression of HSP-27, the human ortholog of HSP-25, results in reduced phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38 and confers protection against oxidative stress and chemical anoxia in LLC-PK1 epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONOur studies demonstrate that prior transient ureteral obstruction results in protection against ischemic injury imposed 5–7 days after release of the obstruction. Ureteral obstruction results in a persistent increase of HSP-25 expression and reduced postischemic activation of JNK1/2 and p38. An imposed increased expression of the human ortholog of HSP-25, HSP-27, in LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells, using an adenoviral construct, leads to partial protection against injury mediated by chemical anoxia or oxidative stress and reduced phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38 induced by H2O2.Zager (9Zager R.A. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 628-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) has studied the effects of prior obstruction on susceptibility to hypoxic/reoxygenation injury of tubules isolated directly from obstructed kidneys. In those studies, Zager reports that the proximal tubules isolated from the kidneys obstructed for 24 h are resistant to hypoxic injury and that the resistance does not require prior uremia, increased HSP-70 expression, or tubular proliferative response (9Zager R.A. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 628-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We previously developed an ischemic preconditioning model and concluded that a local effect within the kidney is probably responsible for protection against subsequent ischemia (5Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we confirm our conclusion derived in the ischemic preconditioning model that prior uremia is not necessary for the protection and that a systemic circulating factor is not responsible for the effect, since protection is observed in the ipsilateral kidney, which sustained unilateral obstruction, but not in the contralateral kidney.Although both bilateral ureteral obstruction and ischemia results in acute renal failure, the cellular basis of development of renal failure is different (4Zager R.A. Burkhart K.M. Gmur D.J. Lab. Invest. 1995; 72: 592-600PubMed Google Scholar). Transient ureteral obstruction does not result in necrotic cell death, whereas ischemia does (8Nagle R.B. Johnson M.E. Jervis H.R. Lab. Invest. 1976; 35: 18-22PubMed Google Scholar). After ischemia, the damaged tubule cells are replaced with regenerating cells (22Sheridan A.M. Bonventre J.V. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2001; 9: 427-434Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 44Witzgall R. Brown D. Schwarz C. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Cells resulting from this regenerative process may be resistant to injury (6Zou X. Tsutsui T. Ray D. Blomquist J.F. Ichijo H. Ucker D.S. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4818-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the studies reported here, we observed that after ureteral obstruction very few proximal tubule cells express PCNA. Thus, transient ureteral obstruction does not enhance cell mitogenesis, indicating that the resistance acquired by ureteral obstruction is not due to epithelial cell regeneration with more resistant “younger” cells.Ischemia results in the disruption of the actin membrane cytoskeleton of renal proximal tubule cells (36Kellerman P.S. Bogusky R.T. Kidney Int. 1992; 42: 896-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 39Abbate M. Bonventre J.V. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F971-F978PubMed Google Scholar). This actin disruption has been implicated in structural and functional alterations including loss of surface membrane polarity, apical membrane bleb formation, detachment of cells, and redistribution of the cortical actin network throughout the cytoplasm (35Kellerman P.S. Clark R.A. Hoilien C.A. Linas S.L. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F279-F285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kellerman P.S. Bogusky R.T.

Physiol. 1999; 276: F544-F551PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, we observed that postischemic changes in the actin cytoskeleton and histological damage are much less apparent in the preconditioned kidneys than in nonpreconditioned kidneys. In the proximal tubular cells of kidneys previously obstructed, immunocytochemical staining for Na+-K+-ATPase, aquaporin-1 and gp330 protein reflect a pattern that is more normal than in the kidneys previously sham-obstructed. The actin cytoskeleton is important for localization of these membrane proteins (35Kellerman P.S. Clark R.A. Hoilien C.A. Linas S.L. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F279-F285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kellerman P.S. Bogusky R.T.

Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1788-1797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) have argued that a change in the cholesterol content of the cell membrane may contribute to the protection they see in proximal tubules that have acquired cytoresistance. It is thus possible that prior ureteral obstruction increases membrane resistance against ischemic insults, unrelated to the differentiation status of the cell.The MAPKs have been implicated in postischemia/reperfusion cell survival, necrosis, and apoptosis (5Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 24Behrens A. Sibilia M. Wagner E.F. Nat.

It has been proposed that activation of JNK and p38 kinases contribute to cell death. Reduction of JNK and p38 activation reduces ATP depletion and ischemic injury (28Gabai V.L. Yaglom J.A. Volloch V. Meriin A.B. Force T. Koutroumanis M. Massie B. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6826-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Ischemia/reperfusion activates p38 MAPK, which results in activation of MAPK-activated protein kinase-2/3 and phosphorylation of its substrate HSP-25/27. It has been shown in studies in hearts that inhibition of p38 MAPK blocks preconditioning (46Armstrong S.C. Shivell C.L. Ganote C.E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1301-1314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 47Maulik N. Yoshida T. Zu Y.L. Sato M. Banerjee A. Das D.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1857-H1864PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported that the protection afforded the kidney as a result of remote ischemic preconditioning correlates with a reduced postischemic activation of JNK1/2 and p38 (5Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Heat shock proteins are induced by various stresses including heat shock, oxidant radicals, chemical toxins, and ischemia/reperfusion (5Park K.M.

Fail. 1994; 16: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is known that prior heat shock confers resistance against damage induced by ischemia or ATP depletion in many organs including kidney and cultured cells (28Gabai V.L. Yaglom J.A. Volloch V. Meriin A.B. Force T. Koutroumanis M. Massie B. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6826-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 49Rordorf G. Koroshetz W.J. Bonventre J.V. Neuron. 1991; 7: 1043-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), although this is not a universal finding and there is a good deal of inconsistency with respect to protection against ischemic injury to the kidney. Among HSPs, HSP-25/27 stabilizes the actin cytoskeleton (43Huot J. Houle F. Spitz D.R. Landry J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 273-279PubMed Google Scholar). Zager (9Zager R.A. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 628-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) reported that the protection seen in proximal tubules from obstructed kidneys occurred without the expression of HSP-70. Kelly et al. (13Kelly K.J. Baird N.R. Greene A.L. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 1798-1802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) found that renal resistance against ischemia conferred by heat stress is dependent on the timing of ischemia relative to heat stress and was not observed when HSPs were not induced. In our ischemic preconditioning model, we reported that protection induced by prior ischemia against subsequent ischemic insult was correlated with the levels of HSP-25 expression, which depended on the length of prior ischemia (5Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we observed that HSP-72 and -25 expression both increased after obstruction. The increased HSP-25 expression was sustained for 6 or 8 days, but HSP-72 was not. The increased HSP-25 was localized to proximal tubular cells in the outer stripe of outer medulla, which are particularly sensitive to ischemia. HSP-25 is expressed in the surviving proximal tubular cells, which maintain an intact nucleus and some degree of cytoskeletal integrity. It is possible that the increased HSP-25 expression might confer stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton.In the present studies, we observed that prior ureteral obstruction reduced the postischemic activation of JNK1/2, p38, MKK4, and MKK3/6. While Western blot analysis of kidney, with its many cell types, does not permit definitive conclusions to be drawn regarding a change in kinase activation in a particular cell, it is possible that HSP-25/27 is involved in reduced activation of JNK1/2, p38, and their upstream MAPK kinases in vulnerable outer medullary proximal tubule cells. Rogalla and colleagues reported that large oligomers of HSP-27 are necessary for chaperone action and resistance against oxidative stress. Phosphorylation down-regulates these activities by dissociation of HSP-25 complexes to tetramers (50Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6826-6836Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) reported that heat shock suppresses the subsequent heat stress-induced activation of JNK and results in thermotolerance. In the present studies, we found that increased expression of HSP-27 by adenovirus-mediated HSP-27 gene transfer reduced, but did not prevent completely, the renal epithelial cell injury induced by ATP depletion or H2O2. Thus, increased expression of HSP-27 alone is not sufficient to protect cells from oxidative or chemical hypoxic stress. Increased HSP-27 expression suppresses the JNK1/2 and p38 activation induced by 1 mm H2O2treatment. Thus, evidence obtained from in vitro andin vivo studies are consistent with a role for HSP-25/27 up-regulation in the reduction in stress kinase activation, thus reducing their adverse effects. Since it is known that stress kinases are expressed in the proximal tubule cells in which we find HSP-25 expression, the protection afforded by HSP-25 may occur at the level of the proximal cell itself.HSP-25 may also reduce the inflammatory response. It is well known that an inflammatory reaction is important in ischemic injury (17Kelly K.J. Williams W.J. Colvin R.B. Meehan S.M. Springer T.A. Gutierrez R.J. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin.

Adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1, contribute to leukocyte-endothelial interactions important for this inflammatory response (17Kelly K.J. Williams W.J. Colvin R.B.

Congestion in the outer medulla is a consequence of enhanced leukocyte-endothelial interactions and associated inflammation (19Terajima H. Enders G. Thiaener A. Hammer C. Kondo T. Thiery J.

HSPs may decrease production of cytokines (18Yoo C.G. Lee S. Lee C.T. Kim Y.W. Han S.K. Shim Y.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5416-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), reducing leukocyte-endothelial interactions (20Rucker M. Schafer T. Roesken F. Spitzer W.J. Bauer M.

Bonventre J.V. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2001; 9: 427-434Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Prior induction of HSPs suppresses cytokine-induced interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α expression and the translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB (18Yoo C.G. Lee S. Lee C.T. Kim Y.W.

Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 1798-1802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that prior heat stress reduces the postischemic leukocyte infiltration in rat. It is unlikely that HSP-25/27 alone is responsible for the protection seen with prior ureteral obstruction, but our data indicate that it may contribute to this protection.In summary, we have demonstrated that the mouse kidney is profoundly protected against ischemia/reperfusion injury imposed 5–7 days after a ureteral obstruction. This protection is associated with up-regulation of HSP-25, prevention of outer medullary vascular congestion, reduction of infiltration of leukocytes, and mitigation of postischemic activation of JNK1/2 and p38 and their upstream MKK4, MEK3/6 MAPK kinases. The increased HSP-25 expression might contribute to the protection through reduced postischemic activation of JNK1/2 and/or p38 and attenuation of the postischemic inflammatory reaction. Prior ischemia leads to resistance against subsequent ischemia in a number of organs (1Murry C.E. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A.

Recently, we observed in kidney that the acquired resistance persists for at least 15 days and is associated with a reduced activation of the JNK1 and p38 MAPKs and their upstream MAPK kinases (5Park K.M. Chen A. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11870-11876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Renal ischemia causes tubular necrosis, and the damaged tubular cells are replaced by regenerating cells. Since dividing cells are less susceptible to oxidative stress than quiescent cells (6Zou X. Tsutsui T. Ray D. Blomquist J.F. Ichijo H. Ucker D.S. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4818-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and the aged heart is more susceptible to ischemic-induced DNA damage than the young heart (7Liu L. Azhar G. Gao W. Zhang X. Wei J.Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: R315-R322PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that epithelial cell regeneration may explain resistance to ischemia. To gain insight into mechanisms responsible for the protection observed with preconditioning, we evaluated whether other interventions that did not result in mitogenesis could protect the kidney against ischemia. Transient ureteral obstruction can result in renal failure in the absence of tubular necrosis (8Nagle R.B. Johnson M.E. Jervis H.R. Lab. Invest. 1976; 35: 18-22PubMed Google Scholar). Zager (9Zager R.A.

We presently observe that insulin mRNA is a highly abundant messenger and that the content of this mRNA is mainly controlled by changes in messenger stability. We also demonstrate specific binding of the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein to a pyrimidine-rich sequence located in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of insulin mRNA. This binding was increased in vitro by dithiothreitol and in vivo by glucose. Inhibition of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein binding to the pyrimidine-rich sequence by mutation of the core binding site resulted in a destabilization of a reporter gene mRNA. Thus, glucose-induced binding of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein to the 3′-UTR of insulin mRNA could be a necessary event in the control of insulin mRNA levels.

Bunce J. Lowry M. Hansen S.E. Hedeskov C.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 517-526Google Scholar). Besides controlling insulin biosynthesis by modulating protein synthesis initiation and elongation rates (2Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 459-467Google Scholar), glucose also stimulates the production of insulin by increasing insulin mRNA levels (3Brunstedt J. Chan S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 106: 1383-1389Google Scholar). This effect is achieved by a selective stimulation of insulin gene transcription (4Nielsen D.A. Welsh M. Casadaban M.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13585-13589Google Scholar) as well as by an increase in insulin mRNA stability (5Welsh M. Nielsen D.A. MacKrell A.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13590-13594Google Scholar). However, the relative contribution of transcriptionalversus post-transcriptional mechanisms to the control of insulin mRNA levels is under debate. According to the original view, insulin mRNA is a highly abundant messenger (6Giddings S.J. Chirgwin J. Permutt M.A. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 343-347Google Scholar), which is not affected by short term glucose challenges (7Itoh N. Sei T. Nose K. Okamoto H. FEBS Lett. 1978; 93: 343-347Google Scholar), and therefore controlled to a large extent by changes in messenger stability (5Welsh M. Nielsen D.A. MacKrell A.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13590-13594Google Scholar). The half-life of insulin mRNA was assessed to be 29 h at a low glucose concentration and 77 h at a high glucose concentration (5Welsh M. Nielsen D.A. MacKrell A.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13590-13594Google Scholar). Recent observations, however, challenge this view by suggesting that insulin mRNA contents of insulin-producing cells are rapidly and dramatically increased by glucose and that this effect is mediated by stimulation of insulin gene transcription (8Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Moede T. Berggren P.-O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 933-938Google Scholar, 9Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Kohler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 4: 9307-9312Google Scholar, 10Leibiger B. Wahlander K. Berggren P.-O. Leibiger I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30153-30156Google Scholar). In addition, it has also been reported that glucose destabilizes, rather than stabilizes, recently formed insulin mRNA (9Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Kohler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 4: 9307-9312Google Scholar). Very little is known on the mechanisms by which glucose, according to the original view, promotes an increased stability of insulin mRNA. A recent study has identified the 3′-untranslated (3′-UTR)1 region as a critical region for glucose-mediated control of rat insulin II mRNA stability (11Wicksteed B. Herbert T.P. Alarcon C. Lingohr M.K. Moss L.G. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22553-22558Google Scholar). We have observed that the 3′-UTR of rat insulin mRNA contains a pyrimidine-rich segment directly downstream of the coding sequence (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, similar pyrimidine-rich segments are located to the insulin mRNA 3′-UTR of several mammalian and non-mammalian species including humans (Fig. 1B). Pyrimidine-rich segments are also present in 3′-UTRs of other long-lived messengers, such as α-globin, (I)-collagen, 15-lipoxygenase, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (Ref. 12Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Google Scholar; Fig. 1A). It appears that the 37–39-kDa poly(C)-binding protein (PCBP), also known as αCP or hnRNP-E, binds to the pyrimidine-rich motifs of these mRNA, thereby assembling a ribonucleoprotein complex, the α-complex, which results in stabilization of the mRNA (13Wang X. Kiledjian M. Weiss I. Liebhaber S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1769-1777Google Scholar). Another interesting pyrimidine-rich sequence-binding protein is the 56-kDa polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) (14Valcarcel J. Gebauer F. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 705-708Google Scholar). As other hnRNP proteins, PTB assists in processing, transport, and translation of mRNAs. However, in insulin-producing MIN6 cells PTB mRNA contents are increased 5-fold by glucose (15Webb G.C. Akbar M.S. Zhao C. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5773-5778Google Scholar). This may indicate that the expression of PTB is under cell-specific control and that PTB contributes to the β-cell phenotype as a glucose-responsive secretor of insulin. The aim of the present study was first to quantify insulin mRNA in rat pancreatic islets. A high insulin mRNA content would strongly support the original view that insulin mRNA contents are mainly controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms. Second, we aimed at characterizing the molecular event by which glucose increases insulin RNA stability. We have therefore studied the putative role of the pyrimidine-rich insulin mRNA 3′-UTR in the regulation of insulin mRNA stability. The RNA oligonucleotides were from Scandinavian Gene Synthesis AB (Köping, Sweden). The rabbit anti-PCBP serum was a generous gift from the laboratory of Ellie Ehrenfeld. David Helfman's and Carol Bromstycks' groups kindly supplied the mouse PTB and rabbit anti-hnRNP K antibodies. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats, from a local colony, were used. Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion (17Eizirik D.L. Welsh N. Hellerstrom C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 76: 399-403Google Scholar). The islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%, Fetal Clone II serum (Hyclone Europe Ltd., Cramlington, UK). The islets were cultured free-floating 5–10 days with the medium changed every second day (16Andersson A. Diabetologia. 1978; 14: 397-404Google Scholar). Human islets were obtained from the Central Unit of the β-Cell Transplant, Brussels, where the islets were isolated and maintained in culture as described previously (17Eizirik D.L. Welsh N. Hellerstrom C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 76: 399-403Google Scholar). Total RNA from 20–30 islets was isolated using the UltraspecTM Total RNA Isolation System (Biotech Laboratories, Houston, TX). First strand cDNA was synthesized using random nonamers and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR reactions were carried out with the Lightcycler real-time PCR instrument, using the Faststart DNA Master CYBR Green I kit (Roche Molecular Biochemical, Mannheim, Germany). The following primers were used: insulin forward, 5′-ACAGCACCTTTGTGGTCC; insulin reverse, 5′-GGACTCAGTTGCAGTAGTTC; β-actin forward, 5′-GCCCTGGCTCCTAGCACC; β-actin reverse, 5′-CCACCAATCCACACAGAGTACTTG. Unknown samples were run in duplicates against an external standard curve with known quantities of linearized pRI7 plasmid, which contains the rat insulin cDNA (18Chan S.J. Noyes B.E. Agarwal K.L. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5036-5040Google Scholar), or linearized β-actin cDNA plasmid. The amplification efficiency was similar for the reverse-transcribed islet RNA samples and pRI7 (Fig.2A). β-Cell number per islet was determined using flow cytometry. Briefly, islets were trypsinized for 5 min at 37 °C to generate free islet cells. The cells were then fixated for 5 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% saponin, and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with a guinea pig anti-insulin antibody. A fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-guinea pig antibody was added, and the cells were analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson Instruments). Cells with increased FL1-fluorescence were gated and counted as β-cells. The following RNA oligonucleotides were used: ins-PRS, 5′-UCCACCACUCCCCGCCCACCCCUCU; ins-PRS mutant 3, 5′-UCCACCACUCCCCGCCCAAAAAUCU; and human ins-PRS, 5′-CCCCCCACCCGCCGCCUCCU. RNA oligonucleotides (1 pmol) were kinased using [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) and bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase (Sigma-Aldrich). The radiolabeled probes were purified on Chroma spin-10 columns (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Rat islets were homogenized in 100 μl of homogenization buffer (19Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Google Scholar), by using a Pellet Pestle® Motor (Kontes, Scientific Glassware/Instruments, Vineland, NJ). The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction and the pellet as the nuclear fraction. The pellet was resuspended in an equal volume homogenization buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. The RNA-protein binding reaction was performed essentially as described previously (19Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Google Scholar). To half the reactions 11 mmdithiothreitol (DTT) was added, before addition of the probe. In some cases, the reaction mixtures were divided into two aliquots, one which was cross-linked by exposed to uv radiation (5 milliwatts/cm2) for 5 min and then analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE, the other was used directly for non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. In the latter case, the samples were applied on a 7% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was fixated, dried, and exposed to a film overnight at −70 °C. RNA oligonucleotide-protein binding reactions were run on a non-denaturing gel, and the position of the retarded and radioactive RNA oligonucleotide-protein complex was visualized by exposing an x-ray film to the gel. The lanes were then cut in three parts: above, at, and below the RNA-protein complex position. Proteins were eluted from the gel slices in 5 mmTris acetate, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mm EDTA under agitation overnight. The eluates were then concentrated on Centricon microconcentrators (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and the proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to a nitrocellulose filter. The filters were hybridized with the monoclonal anti-PTB 3 antibody (20Grossman J.S. Meyer M.I. Wang Y.C. Mulligan G.J. Kobayashi R. Helfman D.M. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 613-625Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:1000) was used as secondary antibody, which was detected by the Amersham ECL system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Northwestern was performed essentially as described previously by others (21Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Google Scholar). Islet proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane and renatured by incubating the membrane in renaturing buffer (21Stefanovic B. Hellerbrand C. Holcik M. Briendl M. Aliebhaber S. Brenner D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5201-5209Google Scholar) for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated in hybridization buffer (renaturing buffer + 20 mg/ml tRNA, 1 mg/ml heparin, and 0.5 nmol of 32P-labeled RNA oligonucleotide) for another 2 h. The membrane was further washed 3 × 10 min in renaturing buffer, dried, and finally exposed to an x-ray film. The position of the radioactive band was compared with that of the PTB, which was visualized by immunoblotting, analyzed in parallel. Double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides with the sequences of wild-type ins-PRS (5′-UCCACCACUCCCCGCCCACCCCUCU), mutant 1 ins-PRS (5′-UCCACCACUCCCCGCCCACCACUCU), or mutant 2 ins-PRS (5′-UCCACCACUCCCCUCCCACCCCUCU) were synthesized with XbaI restriction sites at both ends. The oligonucleotides were then cloned into the XbaI site of the pCRTM3-CAT vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), downstream the coding sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene, and upstream the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. All vectors were control-sequenced using dideoxynucleotide termination sequencing and the Sequenace kit (United States Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH). Lipofection of dispersed islet cells was performed essentially as described previously (22Saldeen J. Curiel D.T. Eizirik D.L. Andersson A. Strandell E. Buschard K. Welsh N. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1197-1203Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with 1 μg of either empty pCR3-CAT vector, pCR3-CAT + wild-type ins-PRS, pCR3-CAT + ins-PRS mutant 1, or pCR3-CAT + ins-PRS mutant 2 and maintained in culture for 48 h. The cells from each of the four dishes were then exposed for 24 h to 2.8 or 28 mm glucose, with our without 5 μg/ml actinomycin D. The cells were collected from the previous step, and the RNA was isolated using the UltraspecTM Total RNA Isolation reagent. The You-Prime First-strand Beads kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) was used for cDNA synthesis. The sequences of the PCR primers were CAT forward, 5-GAATGCTCATCCGGAACT; CAT reverse, 5′-CCAGGGTCAAGGAAGGCACGG; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase forward, 5′-GACCCCTTCATTGACCTCA; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reverse, 5′-CCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAA. When analyzing samples treated with actinomycin D, 30 cycles were required to see PCR products in the exponential phase. However, for samples not treated with actinomycin D, 25 cycles were sufficient. The PCR products were run in an 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide for quantification of 28 S rRNA. Using real-time PCR, insulin mRNA contents of in vitrocultured rat pancreatic islets were quantified. We first assessed basal and non-stimulated insulin mRNA levels by preculturing the islets for 24 h at a substimulatory glucose concentration and in the absence of serum. At these basal conditions, we observed that a β-cell contains 40,000–50,000 insulin mRNA molecules and that insulin mRNA is 60–80 times more frequent than the messenger for β-actin (Fig. 2B). In line with this, a short term (1 h) stimulation with a high glucose concentration did not increase the contents of insulin mRNA (Fig. 2B). Insulin has recently been reported to potently stimulate insulin gene transcription (8Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Moede T. Berggren P.-O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 933-938Google Scholar, 9Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Kohler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 4: 9307-9312Google Scholar, 10Leibiger B. Wahlander K. Berggren P.-O. Leibiger I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30153-30156Google Scholar). However, addition of 5 μg/ml insulin did not affect insulin mRNA contents (Fig. 2B). These insulin mRNA estimates are based upon the assumption that the yield and efficiency of the RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis procedures are 100%. Our results might therefore be underestimates. Next, we quantified insulin mRNA contents in response to a long term (24 h) glucose and serum stimulation. The insulin mRNA contents of control islets dropped to ∼20,000/β-cell (Fig.2C). This is not surprising, because prolonged culture without glucose and serum (24 h + 24 h) is known to result in β-cell apoptosis (23Hoorens A. Van de Casteele M. Kloppel G. Pipeleers D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1568-1574Google Scholar). The 24-h high glucose stimulation increased insulin mRNA contents to ∼100,000/β-cell (Fig. 2C). Also the ratio insulin mRNA to β-actin mRNA was markedly increased (Fig. 2C). Having established that insulin mRNA is highly abundant and only slowly increased in response to glucose, we next addressed the question whether transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms mediate the regulatory effect of glucose. For this purpose, islets were precultured in the presence of serum and high glucose to bring the insulin mRNA contents up to high levels. Next, some of the islets were transferred to a low glucose-containing medium with or without actinomycin D. As expected, a 16-h incubation at a low glucose concentration promoted a small (35%) decrease in insulin mRNA (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, inhibition of RNA synthesis did not decrease insulin mRNA contents and the drop induced by low glucose was of the same magnitude in the presence as in the absence of actinomycin D (Fig.2D). This correlates well with previous findings showing that actinomycin D does not markedly reduce insulin mRNA levels (5Welsh M. Nielsen D.A. MacKrell A.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13590-13594Google Scholar). This is possibly explained by inhibition of synthesis of insulin mRNA degrading factors, which would mask the inhibiting effect on insulin gene transcription (5Welsh M. Nielsen D.A. MacKrell A.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13590-13594Google Scholar). On the other hand, β-actin mRNA did not decrease in response to low glucose and the actinomycin D-induced decrease was more pronounced than that of insulin mRNA (Fig. 2D). Consequently, the low glucose-induced decrease in the insulin mRNA/β-actin mRNA ratio was of the same relative magnitude both with and without actinomycin D (Fig. 2D). These findings are in line with the previously established insulin mRNA half-life of 29 h at a low glucose concentration, 77 h at a high glucose concentration, and a β-actin mRNA half-life of 9 h (5Welsh M. Nielsen D.A. MacKrell A.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13590-13594Google Scholar, 24Chen M. Schnermann J. Smart A.M. Brosius F.C. Killen P.D. Briggs J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24138-24144Google Scholar). The findings that glucose-induced changes in insulin mRNA stability control insulin mRNA contents prompted us to next investigate the mechanisms that regulate insulin mRNA stability. Probing for specific binding to the pyrimidine-rich insulin mRNA 3′-UTR sequence (ins-PRS), we observed binding of a 25-bp ins-PRS RNA oligonucleotide to a cytosolic protein, both in liver and islet cells. This binding resulted in a cross-linked complex with the combined molecular mass of 65–70 kDa (Fig. 3, A–C). If it were assumed that the RNA oligonucleotide increases the molecular mass of the complex with 10 kDa, the molecular mass of the RNA-binding protein would be 55–60 kDa. This binding was not observed in the absence of uv cross-linking, nor when a mutated RNA oligonucleotide, in which four centrally located C were replaced by A (ins-PRS mutant 3), was used (Fig. 3A). In liver cells, there was also prominent binding to the ins-PRS RNA oligonucleotide by a 40-kDa protein (Fig. 3A). The identity of this protein is not known, but the MW corresponds well to PCBP, which has been reported to bind to the pyrimidine-rich sequence of TH mRNA (25Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Bendixen A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2111-2120Google Scholar). Binding of the 40-kDa protein to the ins-PRS RNA oligonucleotide was, however, not consistently observed in islet cells (Fig. 3, B andC). Using cytosolic extracts from non-stimulated rat pancreatic islets, we observed that the reducing agents DTT (Fig. 3B) or β-mercaptoethanol (data not shown) increased binding of the 55–60-kDa protein to ins-PRS. The enhancing effect of DTT was dose-dependent and reached maximum at 5–10 mm (data not shown). The increased binding of the 55–60-kDa protein to ins-PRS in response to DTT was also observed when binding reactions were analyzed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3D). In this case, binding was visualized by retardation of the radioactive RNA oligonucleotide, and the intensity of the retarded band corresponded well to the intensity of the 65–70-kDa protein-RNA oligonucleotide complex observed in parallel cross-linking experiments (Fig. 3, C andD). The effect of reducing agents was not as clear in islet homogenates stimulated with a high glucose concentration as compared with non-stimulated islets (Fig. 3, C and D). Instead, the ins-PRS binding activity of glucose-stimulated islets was enhanced in the absence of DTT and not further increased in the presence of DTT. These findings suggest that the ins-PRS binding activity is maximally stimulated in the presence of DTT and that differences observed in binding activity in the absence of DTT may reflect the in vivo activity of the 55–60-kDa protein. Thus, by expressing ins-PRS binding activity as the ratio binding activity −DTT/+DTT, we correct for differences in total amount of the 55–60-kDa protein present in islet samples. When analyzing the effect of glucose, it was found that the ins-PRS binding activity in rat islet cytosol was significantly increased by 28 mm, but not by 5 mm glucose (Fig. 4). In nuclear extracts, both 5 and 28 mm glucose increased ins-PRS binding activity as compared with no glucose (Fig. 4). Thus, glucose-induced stabilization of insulin mRNA is paralleled by increased binding of the 55–60-kDa protein to ins-PRS. Also human insulin mRNA 3′-UTR contains a pyrimidine-rich motif (Fig. 1B). To determine whether binding in human islet cytosol extracts to the human ins-PRS occurs, we analyzed binding reactions by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. It was observed that a similar gel retardation product was present in human islet extracts as in rat islet extracts (Fig. 3E). This indicates that a similar insulin mRNA 3′-UTR-protein complex is formed in human islets as in rat islets. To determine the identity of the ins-PRS-binding protein, we performed supershift analysis using antibodies specific for hnRNP-K, PCBP, and PTB. The antibodies against hnRNP-K and PCBP did not generate a supershift (Fig. 5A, results not shown). However, two different PTB monoclonal antibodies specifically abolished the ins-PRS/protein complex, an effect that was not observed with control ascites fluid (Fig. 5A). This indicates that antibody binding to PTB blocks PTB binding to the ins-PRS RNA oligonucleotide. The Northwestern technique was utilized to probe for ins-PRS binding activity of proteins immobilized to a nitrocellulose filter. We observed ins-PRS binding activity of a renatured protein, which migrated to the same position as PTB (Fig. 5B). Further evidence in support for PTB as the ins-PRS-binding protein was obtained by analyzing the presence of PTB at the position of the ins-PRS-protein complex in a non-denaturing electromobility shift assay gel. By eluting proteins from above, at and below the position of the ins-PRS-protein complex, we observed PTB immunoreactivity at the complex position in samples with ins-PRS probe present during the binding reaction, but not in samples without (Fig. 5C). The remaining PTB immunoreactivity was located above and not below the position of the ins-PRS-protein complex. These results indicate that the fraction of PTB that binds the ins-PRS RNA oligonucleotide alters its three-dimensional conformation so that it migrates faster in a non-denaturing gel. To exclude the possibility that increased binding of PTB to ins-PRS is due to altered stability in response to DTT or glucose, islet cell homogenates were incubated for 50 min in homogenization buffer with or without 11 mm DTT. Samples were then analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-PTB-3 antibody and counterstained with Amido Black. It was observed that the in vitro stability of PTB (Fig.6A) and ins-PRS (Fig.6B) was not affected by the addition of DTT. In addition, islets were incubated for 1 h in medium containing 2.8 or 28 mm glucose, and the amount of expressed PTB was examined by immunoblotting. We could not observe any differences in PTB expression between the two groups (Fig. 6C), indicating that a 1-h incubation period is not sufficient to alter PTB contents. Mutation of the critical pyrimidines to purines resulted in abolished binding of PTB to ins-PRS in vitro(Fig. 3A). To assess whether mRNA stability is affected by PTB binding to ins-PRS in vivo, we lipofected dispersed rat islet cells with pCRTM-CAT vector with or without wild-type or mutated ins-PRS. In the presence of actinomycin D, we observed that the reporter gene mRNA containing the wild-type rat insulin I ins-PRS was equally abundant as the mRNA lacking ins-PRS (Fig. 7A). However, a mutation of one of the pyrimidines to a purine in the PTB core-binding site resulted in a marked destabilization of the mRNA, whereas a mutation of a purine to a pyrimidine outside the core-binding site had no effect (Fig. 7A). Similar results were obtained in cells incubated in the absence of actinomycin D (Fig. 7B), indicating that transcription of the reporter gene was not affected by the ins-PRS mutation. In cells expressing wild-type ins-PRS, there was no increase in reporter gene mRNA levels in response to glucose. To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify insulin mRNA in isolated pancreatic islets. At physiological conditions,i.e. in the presence of serum, the β-cell content of insulin mRNAs was at least 40,000–100,000 molecules, depending upon the glucose concentration of the culture medium. This finding is in agreement with the early and indirect assessment (6Giddings S.J. Chirgwin J. Permutt M.A. Diabetologia. 1985; 28: 343-347Google Scholar), which indicated a β-cell insulin mRNA content of 50,000–150,000 molecules. A typical mammalian cell contains ∼360,000 mRNAs in its cytoplasm (26Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell.Third Ed. Garland Publishing, Inc., New York1994: 369Google Scholar). Assuming that the same number applies to the β-cell, insulin mRNA would constitute up to 30% of all mRNA, which correlates well with the percentage of insulin protein synthesized (1Ashcroft S.J. Bunce J. Lowry M. Hansen S.E. Hedeskov C.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 517-526Google Scholar). We did not observe any increase in insulin mRNA in response to a short term (60 min) glucose stimulation. This is, however, not surprising considering that insulin mRNA is vastly abundant in β-cells. The transcriptional output of insulin mRNA by the two insulin genes present in rat has not been determined experimentally. However, a theoretical calculation of the maximal insulin mRNA synthesis rate tells us that no more than 2500 transcripts/h are produced. This assessment is based upon an elongation rate of 30 nucleotides per second and that 10 RNA polymerases transcribe each insulin gene simultaneously. Although this is most likely an overestimate, it is far from the net increase of 40000 molecules, which is the minimum number of molecules necessary to double the insulin mRNA content of low glucose cultured islets in 1 h. In our hands, the insulin mRNA content is only slightly decreased by a 16 h glucose withdrawal. The same decrease was observed in islets with inhibited RNA polymerase activity. This indicates that control of insulin mRNA stability contributes significantly to the regulation of insulin mRNA levels. Indeed, it is generally agreed that the contents of abundant and long lived messengers are subject to post-transcriptional, rather than transcriptional control. This view is challenged by Leibiger and co-workers (8Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Moede T. Berggren P.-O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 933-938Google Scholar, 9Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Kohler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 4: 9307-9312Google Scholar, 10Leibiger B. Wahlander K. Berggren P.-O. Leibiger I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30153-30156Google Scholar), who report that insulin mRNA contents are increased up to 5-fold in response to a 60-min glucose stimulation. The reason for the apparent incompatibilities between the present work and the work by the Leibiger group is unclear. Although glucose is known to specifically increase insulin mRNA stability (5Welsh M. Nielsen D.A. MacKrell A.J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13590-13594Google Scholar), little is hitherto known of the molecular mechanisms underlying this event. However, a recent report identified the 3′-UTR of insulin mRNA as critical for control of messenger stability (11Wicksteed B. Herbert T.P. Alarcon C. Lingohr M.K. Moss L.G. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22553-22558Google Scholar). The UUGAA sequence, located between the polyadenylation signal and the polyadenylation site, was suggested to be important because of its conservancy (11Wicksteed B. Herbert T.P. Alarcon C. Lingohr M.K. Moss L.G. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22553-22558Google Scholar). Alternatively, a closer analysis of the 3′-UTR of rat insulin mRNA (Fig. 1A) shows that the region just up-stream of the polyadenylation signal and downstream of the termination codon contains a pyrimidine-rich sequence, with similarities to the PTB (27Singh R. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1173-1176Google Scholar) and PCBP (12Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Google Scholar, 28Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3293-3299Google Scholar) consensus binding sequences (Fig. 1A). Protein binding to 3′-UTR pyrimidine-rich segments of for example TH and erythropoetin mRNA has been implicated in both constitutive and regulated stability control of the messenger (25Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Bendixen A.C. Blood. 1999; 93: 2111-2120Google Scholar, 29Paulding W.R. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2532-2538Google Scholar). In line with this notion, we have presently observed specific binding of a 55–60-kDa protein to the ins-PRS RNA oligonucleotide. Moreover, mutation of one cytidine to an adenosine in the ins-PRS, which probably prevented protein binding, resulted in marked destabilization of the CAT reporter gene mRNA. This is in line with the work by Wicksteed et al., (11Wicksteed B. Herbert T.P. Alarcon C. Lingohr M.K. Moss L.G. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22553-22558Google Scholar) in which it was shown that the 3′-UTR of insulin mRNA contains stability determinants that mediated a decreased reporter messenger stability when expressed in hepatocytes. This raises the possibility that destabilizing elements of the insulin RNA messenger are masked by β-cell-specific protein binding to the ins-PRS sequence. We presently observe that a high glucose concentration, which increases insulin mRNA contents by stabilizing the messenger, stimulated protein binding to ins-PRS. This indicates that regulated protein binding to the ins-PRS element could be a necessary event in glucose-mediated insulin mRNA stabilization. On the other hand, levels of the reporter gene mRNA remained unaffected after introduction of the wild-type ins-PRS as well as after culture at a high glucose concentration. Assuming that dispersed and transfected islet cells respond to glucose as normal islet cells do, it may be that the presence of ins-PRS is not sufficient for glucose-induced stabilization of messenger stability. Thus, there may be a requirement of other cis-acting mRNA elements to obtain full control of glucose-induced changes in mRNA stability. The induced stability of TH mRNA in response to hypoxia is for instance dependent of protein interactions with both the 3′-UTR and the coding region of the mRNA (29Paulding W.R. Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2532-2538Google Scholar). Using specific antibodies, we have presently observed that the ins-PRS-binding protein is probably PTB. It is not clear why PCBP1 or PCBP2, which both are present in islet cells (results not shown) and which may bind ins-PRS in liver cells, do not bind ins-PRS in islet cell homogenates. PCBP is thought to bind TH mRNA, either at the PCBP consensus binding sequence present in rat TH mRNA (12Holcik M. Liebhaber S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2410-2414Google Scholar) or/and at the PCBP-hypoxia-inducible protein-binding site present in human TH mRNA (28Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Beresh J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3293-3299Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The rat ins-PRS sequence is quite similar to these PCBP-binding sites (Fig. 1A). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that PCBP, at least in liver homogenates, could bind ins-PRS. On the other hand, one or two putative PTB-binding sites are easily identified in rat ins-PRS (Fig. 1A). In addition, pyrimidine-rich sequences similar to the PTB consensus binding site, but not to the PCBP sites, seem to be present in insulin mRNA of most species with known 3′-UTR sequences (Fig. 1B). Taken together, this supports our finding that PTB is the main ins-PRS-binding protein and that this event is evolutionarily conserved. Species with no ins-PRS are frog, hagfish, and chimpanzee. The frog and particularly the hagfish are evolutionary distant species that both have insulin mRNA 3′-UTRs that are several hundred bases long, suggesting that these mRNAs utilize other mechanisms for messenger stability control. The chimpanzee, however, has lost 48 bp of its insulin gene due to a deletion at a site just after the reading frame (30Seino S. Bell G.I. Li W-H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1992; 9: 193-203Google Scholar). This results in a very short 3′-UTR without any pyrimidine-rich motif. Had it been possible to perform experimental studies with chimpanzee islets, it would have been very interesting to determine whether insulin mRNA levels in the chimpanzee are governed by the same signals as in rodent and human islets. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been observed in the chimpanzee and may be more frequent than expected (31Rosenblum I.Y. Barbolt T.A. Howard Jr., C.F. J. Med. Primatol. 1981; 10: 93-101Google Scholar). The main known function of PTB is to inhibit mRNA splicing (32Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3281-3288Google Scholar). In addition, PTB is thought to play an important role in events such as cap-independent translation (33Kim Y.K. Hahm B. Jang S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 119-133Google Scholar), RNA polyadenylation, (34Moreira A. Takagaki Y. Brackenridge S. Wollerton M. Manley J.L. Proudfoot N.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2522-2534Google Scholar) and RNA localization (35Cote C.A. Gautreau D. Denegre J.M. Kress T.L. Terry N.A. Mowry K.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 431-437Google Scholar). The PTB-binding site in insulin mRNA is located just upstream of the polyadenylation signal, and it is not unlikely that PTB, in addition to regulation of mRNA stability, is involved in polyadenylation, transport, and/or translation. Moreover, PTB exists in three different isoforms, with differential alternative splicing activity, and PTB homologues with cell type-specific expression patterns have recently been identified (36Wollerton M.C. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E.C. Jackson R.J. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Google Scholar). Consequently, the possibility exists that PTB isoforms and the different PTB homologues have overlapping but distinct RNA binding specificities and that a specific PTB isoform or homologue is expressed in β-cells with the purpose to modulate insulin mRNA levels. Although PTB mRNA expression is up-regulated about five times in the β-cell line MIN6, in response to a 24-h glucose stimulation (15Webb G.C. Akbar M.S. Zhao C. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5773-5778Google Scholar), we could not detect any differences in protein expression after a 1-h incubation at different glucose concentrations. This suggests that acute alterations in the PTB binding activity is regulated by post-translational modifications rather than by increased PTB gene expression. Furthermore, PTB is known to interact with other members of the hnRNP family such as hnRNP-E2 (PCBP 2), -K, and -L, which are all expressed in islets (Refs. 33Kim Y.K. Hahm B. Jang S.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 119-133Google Scholar and 37Kamma H. Portman D.S. Dreyfuss G. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 187-196Google Scholar, present results). Thus, the interaction of PTB with additional RNA-binding proteins may be necessary events in glucose-mediated regulation of insulin mRNA stability. In summary, we have identified an interaction between the rat insulin I 3′-UTR and the protein PTB, an event that may be necessary for glucose-induced stabilization of insulin mRNA. Future studies will hopefully identify additional proteins and cis-acting elements, which co-operate in mediating a high insulin mRNA stability and availability for translation. Finally, it is possible that disturbances of the insulin mRNA metabolism contribute to the development of diabetes mellitus. Interestingly, the chromosomal localization of the PTB gene has been assigned to chromosome 14-23-p24.1 (38Raimondi E. Romanelli M.G. Moralli D. Gamberi C. Russo M.P. Morandi C. Genomics. 1995; 27: 553-555Google Scholar), which is in close proximity to the IDDM11 locus in humans (39Field L.L. Tobias R. Thomson G. Plon S. Genomics. 1996; 33: 1-8Google Scholar).

This location is distinct from but close to the location found for Ca2+-CaM, providing a structural basis for efficient switching of CaM between these two positions with the oscillating intracellular Ca2+ concentration that generates muscle relaxation/contraction cycles.

Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Google Scholar, 2Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 3Shoshan-Barmatz V. Ashley R.H. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 183: 185-270Google Scholar). Some of the RyR1s are thought to contact directly and to be under the control of dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), voltage sensors situated on the cell membrane infoldings (T-tubules) that are juxtaposed to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The DHPR senses the membrane depolarization wave associated with a neuronal impulse and undergoes a conformational change and intramembrane charge movement (4Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Google Scholar). This is apparently necessary and sufficient for RyR1 activation, which results in a global intracellular Ca2+ increase from above pCa 7 to pCa 6–4, a level of Ca2+ that triggers contraction of the muscle fiber (5Endo M. Physiol. Rev. 1977; 57: 71-108Google Scholar). RyR1 itself is regulated by Ca2+ in a biphasic fashion with an activation peak at pCa ∼5.5 and inhibition below pCa 3 or above 7 (6Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 244-251Google Scholar). In addition to its vital function in skeletal muscle, RyR1 is an abundant RyR isoform in cerebellar neurons (7Martin C. Chapman K.E. Seckl J.R. Ashley R.H. Neuroscience. 1998; 85: 205-216Google Scholar) where it also appears to communicate with the plasma membrane DHPR (8Chavis P. Fagni L. Lansman J.B. Bockaert J. Nature. 1996; 382: 719-722Google Scholar). In the brain, RyRs have been hypothesized to play a role in synaptic plasticity and apoptosis (9Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. Chan S.L. Leissring M.A. Shepel P.N. Geiger J.D. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 222-229Google Scholar). As has been reported for some other Ca2+ channels (10Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 645-648Google Scholar), RyR1 is further regulated by CaM, the main mediator of Ca2+signaling in eukaryotes. Modulation of RyR1 by CaM is complex. At pCa 4, Ca2+-saturated CaM (Ca2+-CaM) binds directly to the RyR1 with a stoichiometry of one mole of apoCaM per RyR1 subunit (i.e. four CaMs per tetrameric RyR1 complex) (11Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32463-32471Google Scholar, 12Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar) and partially inhibits channel activity (6Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 244-251Google Scholar, 13Fuentes O. Valdivia C. Vaughan D. Coronado R. Valdivia H.H. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 305-316Google Scholar), but at pCa 7, Ca2+-depleted CaM (apoCaM) becomes an activator (14Yang H.C. Reedy M.M. Burke C.L. Strasburg G.M.

In both cases CaM reduces the direct effect produced by Ca2+ alone acting on the RyR1. CaM also mediates RyR1's redox sensitivity to nitric oxide and oxygen species (18Porter M.C. Zhang J.Z. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36831-36834Google Scholar, 19Eu J.P. Sun J. Xu L. Stamler J.S. Meissner G. Cell. 2000; 102: 499-509Google Scholar). Other proteins are also modulated by Ca2+-CaM and apoCaM. Among these, either CaM is bound to the same sequence at both high and low [Ca2+], or the effector protein has two or more binding sites with different requirements of [Ca2+] for CaM binding (20Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Google Scholar). For RyR1, the number of CaM-binding sites as well as whether the two forms of CaM share common binding sites has been subject of study (12Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar, 14Yang H.C. Reedy M.M. Burke C.L. Strasburg G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 518-525Google Scholar, 15Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Google Scholar). Within RyR1's ∼5000 amino acid residues, several putative CaM binding motifs have been proposed that could account for both Ca2+-dependent and -independent CaM binding (16Buratti R. Prestipino G. Menegazzi P. Treves S. Zorzato F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 1082-1090Google Scholar, 21Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M.

Two recent independent reports suggest that there are two binding sites per subunit (one for apoCaM and one for Ca2+-CaM), both contained in a short segment (∼30 residues) of the RyR1 sequence (24Rodney G.G.

Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Google Scholar), a structural model that includes the complete regulated protein is lacking but is necessary to understand the mechanism of action of CaM, particularly in those proteins that bind both apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM. Cryo-electron microscopy and image processing have been used to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of native isolated RyR1 (31Samsó M. Wagenknecht T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 172-180Google Scholar). In this study, we have used these techniques to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR1 in the presence and absence of apoCaM. Difference mapping shows the locations where apoCaM binds to the RyR1, and incidentally, provides an independent means to the biochemical assays used previously to assess the stoichiometry of binding. The binding site for apoCaM found in this study is distinct from but close to the known location for Ca2+-CaM (11Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32463-32471Google Scholar, 32Wagenknecht T. Berkowitz J. Grassucci R. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 2286-2295Google Scholar). We propose a model for CaM activity whereby this molecule acts as a mobile Ca2+-sensing subunit of RyR1. Furthermore, the locations of RyR1-bound CaM occur in a region implicated in interactions of RyR1 with DHPR, and on this basis we propose that CaM could be involved in the mechanism of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in skeletal muscle. Part of this study has been published previously in abstract form (33Samsó M. Berkowitz J. Wagenknecht T. Biophys. J. 2000; 78 (A): 149Google Scholar). RyR1 was isolated as described previously (11Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32463-32471Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.; brain CaM and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. RyR1·apoCaM complexes were prepared by mixing 1 volume of CaM-free RyR1 (in 10 mm Na-PIPES, pH 7.4, 0.45m NaCl, 25 μm EGTA, 20 μmleupeptin, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% PC, 0.5 mm fresh dithiothreitol) and 1 volume of CaM in buffer C (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 20 μm leupeptin) to achieve a CaM:RyR1 molar ratio of 18. The RyR1 control (no apoCaM) was also diluted with 1 volume of buffer C, and all mixtures were incubated for 20–40 min at room temperature prior to cryo-plunging. PC and CHAPS concentrations were diluted to 0.09 and 0.2%, respectively, so as to allow sufficient image contrast, by adding buffer C during sample application to the electron microscopy grid (34Sharma M.R. Penczek P. Grassucci R. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18429-18434Google Scholar). Grids were blotted with Whatman filter paper No. 540. Cryo-electron microscopy was performed on a Philips EM 420 transmission electron microscope operated at 100 kV under low dose conditions at a magnification of ×52,000, and micrographs were taken at 0°, 30°, and 50° tilt. High quality micrographs (71 for RyR1 control and 41 for RyR1·apoCaM) were digitized on a Hi-Scan (Eurocore) densitometer at a pixel size of 3.8 Å, which was binned down to 7.7 Å prior to three-dimensional reconstruction. Individual particles (7814 for RyR1 control and 4887 for RyR1·apoCaM) were selected from the micrographs and processed using the SPIDER/WEB software package (35Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Google Scholar) as described previously (36Samsó M. Trujillo R. Gurrola G.B. Valdivia H.H. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 493-499Google Scholar). 4-fold two-dimensional averages were generated using 900 particles. Three-dimensional reconstructions were computed using projection-matching algorithms (37Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Google Scholar) with an existing three-dimensional reconstruction of RyR1 (38Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Google Scholar) as a reference. The contribution of 4-fold views was reduced with final numbers of particles of 2798 for RyR1 control and 2079 for RyR1·apoCaM. Two-dimensional averages and three-dimensional reconstructions were filtered to their limiting resolution as calculated according to the Fourier ring and shell correlation criteria, respectively, with a cutoff value of 0.5 (39Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I.S. Grassucci R.A. Junemann R. Burkhardt N. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Google Scholar). Three-dimensional reconstructions were displayed with isosurface representations at a threshold that corresponds to the midpoint of the density profile of the reconstruction boundary. Electron micrographs of frozen hydrated specimens show the fine structure that is indicative of well preserved tetrameric RyR1s (Fig.1A) and a high proportion of 4-fold-symmetric views, corresponding to RyR1s lying with their 4-fold symmetry axes normal to the carbon support film. Two-dimensional averages performed on such 4-fold views (resolution of 28 Å), prepared in the presence and absence of apoCaM, display the typical square shape with protruding corners (clamps) and a central cross (31Samsó M. Wagenknecht T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 172-180Google Scholar, 38Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Google Scholar) (Fig. 1,B and C). Direct comparison of the two two-dimensional averages reveals that in the presence of apoCaM, a small region in domain 3 (Fig. 1C, arrows) is increased in density, and a small protuberance appears on its external side. Subtraction of the RyR1 control average from that of the RyR1·apoCaM yields a difference map showing four discrete positive (white) densities (Fig. 1D) that are statistically significant at the 99.9% confidence level according to the t test (40Armitage P. Berry G. Statistical Methods in Medical Research.3rd Ed. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Cambridge, MA1994: 99-103Google Scholar). It is highly likely that these regions of excess density correspond to apoCaM bound to RyR1. The three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR1 with and without (control) apoCaM (Fig. 2, A andB) with resolutions of 28 and 26 Å, respectively, show a square prism-shaped cytoplasmic assembly with 10 distinguishable domains and a differentiated smaller transmembrane region, as was described previously (31Samsó M. Wagenknecht T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 172-180Google Scholar, 38Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Google Scholar, 41Serysheva I.I. Orlova E.V. Chiu W. Sherman M.B. Hamilton S.L. van Heel M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 18-24Google Scholar). As anticipated from the two-dimensional analysis, the two reconstructions display a major difference at the outer face of domain 3: a concave region present in the control RyR1 reconstruction becomes protuberant when apoCaM is added (compare boxed areas in Fig. 2, A andB). Subtraction of the two volumes yields four ellipsoidal-shaped masses (Fig. 2C), each having its major axis approximately perpendicular to the plane of the square defined by the cytoplasmic assembly. We attribute each of these masses to an apoCaM molecule (i.e. one apoCaM per RyR1 subunit). Consistent with this interpretation, we found that an atomic model of a peptide·apoCaM complex (42Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Google Scholar), following low pass filtration to the resolution of our three-dimensional reconstructions, closely matches in shape and size the ellipsoidal-shaped masses that form the difference map (not shown). To check the internal consistency of our results, the three-dimensional reconstructions and three-dimensional difference map were projected onto a plane normal to the 4-fold symmetry axis of the RyR1 to simulate the results of the two-dimensional analysis. These computed projections (Fig. 1, E–G) reproduce the main features of the two-dimensional analysis (Fig. 1, B–D). An alternative but unlikely interpretation of the structural differences between RyR1 and RyR1·apoCaM is that they are due to conformational changes in RyR1 induced by apoCaM binding to RyR1. However, conformational differences should result in comparable levels of both positive and negative densities in difference images, whereas the three-dimensional difference map obtained from the RyR1·apoCaM and RyR1 three-dimensional reconstructions does not display any significant negative density. Therefore, we conclude that the four additional ellipsoidal masses arise from four molecules of apoCaM bound to the surface of RyR1. This does not preclude the possibility of conformational changes at a smaller scale, which might not produce detectable differences at the level of resolution attained. We compared the location of apoCaM to the location already found for Ca2+-CaM (11Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32463-32471Google Scholar). Both forms of CaM contact domain 3 of each of the four RyR1 subunits. However, depending on the Ca2+ concentration, CaM locates at distinct sites on the RyR1. ApoCaM is situated closer to the T-tubule face of RyR1 and protrudes more from the lateral surface of the structure, whereas Ca2+-CaM appears in each of the crevices formed by domains 3 and 6/8 (Fig. 3, A andB). The major axes of the Ca2+-CaM and apoCaM molecules form an angle of ∼140° (Fig. 3C), and their geometric centers are 33 ± 5 Å apart. If bound simultaneously, the volumes of Ca2+-CaM and apoCaM would interpenetrate partially (Fig. 3D). Therefore, simultaneous occupation of both sites seems unlikely. ApoCaM and Ca2+-CaM, which differ substantially in their structural and physicochemical properties as well as in their biological effects, have been spatially localized on the intact RyR1 tetrameric complex (summarized in Fig. 3, A and B). The two forms of CaM bind on the sides of the cytoplasmic assembly of RyR1 to distinct, overlapping locations with centers separated by 33 ± 5 Å. The two sites are sufficiently close, and the orientations of the bound CaMs are such that simultaneous binding of apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM would appear to be unlikely due to steric interference. This is further evidence that only four CaM molecules could be bound to the RyR1 at a given time, regardless of the Ca2+ concentration. Although nine potential binding sites for CaM have been identified within the sequence of the RyR1 polypeptide (21Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9078-9084Google Scholar), conflicting reports have appeared regarding the actual number of CaM-binding sites (12Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar, 14Yang H.C. Reedy M.M. Burke C.L. Strasburg G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 518-525Google Scholar, 15Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Google Scholar). Our findings, based upon three-dimensional structural determination, agree with the results of biochemical assays (12Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar), which show that each RyR1 subunit binds only one molecule of Ca2+-CaM or one of apoCaM. Bound apoCaM or Ca2+-CaM protects the same two peptide bonds (between residues 3630–3631 and 3637–3638) from proteolysis by trypsin (12Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar), and further, a synthetic peptide containing these residues of the RyR1 subunit (amino acids 3614–3643) was found to be capable of binding with high affinity either apoCaM or Ca2+-CaM (24Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B.Y. Zhang J.Z. Krol J. Pedersen S.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Google Scholar). Additional experiments employing other related peptides, together with experiments using single point RyR1 mutants (25Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar), were interpreted as supporting a model in which apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM bind to distinct but overlapping sites on the peptide. Our spatial localizations of the two forms of CaM are compatible with such results, although the 33 ± 5 Å distance between the centers of the sites that we found is somewhat greater than might have been expected. We propose several modes of CaM binding that could account for the ∼33-Å separation between the centers of apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM while both forms of CaM still preserve interactions with amino acid residues contained within a short segment of the RyR1 sequence (Fig. 4). (i) For instance, the apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM sites could be related by a translation of the CaM along the linear sequence of the RyR1 such that the “protected region” is bound by or in the immediate neighborhood of one or the other of the two major domains of CaM (Fig.4A). (ii) The domain of CaM not interacting with the protected sequence could even bind to a non-contiguous region of the RyR1 sequence (Fig. 4B), a situation that is reminiscent of a recently characterized mode of CaM binding to a target protein (30Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Google Scholar). (iii) The translation of CaM could involve a change in the polarity of the amino and carboxyl domains of CaM with respect to the target peptide (Fig. 4C). Although CaM interacts predominantly with its target peptides in an antiparallel fashion with the amino terminus of the peptide interacting with the C-lobe of Ca2+-CaM, the opposite orientation has also been described (29Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Google Scholar, 44Zhang M. Yuan T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 313-323Google Scholar). (iv) Alternatively, conformational differences between RyR1·apoCaM and RyR1·Ca2+-CaM could contribute to the separation of CaM-binding sites at high and low [Ca2+] (Fig. 4D). RyR1 itself is sensitive to Ca2+, showing a bell-shaped activation curve with a maximum at pCa 4. Interestingly, CaM bound to RyR1 counteracts this effect partially, inhibiting the channel at millimolar Ca2+ concentrations and activating it at submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations. Because both CaM and RyR1 are affected by Ca2+, the RyR1-CaM interactions need to be interpreted in this context. We explored the possibility of a Ca2+-induced conformational change as a cause for the different locations of CaM at high and low [Ca2+] by comparing three-dimensional reconstructions of RyR1 without added CaM at pCa >6 and at pCa 4 (11Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32463-32471Google Scholar, 36Samsó M. Trujillo R. Gurrola G.B. Valdivia H.H. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 493-499Google Scholar). Although there are some minor conformational differences in the vicinity of the CaM-binding regions, the relatively large distance between apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM is unlikely to be solely the result of a conformational change induced by Ca2+. The target surface for both forms of CaM is situated ∼10 nm away from the Ca2+-conducting pore contained in the transmembrane region, suggesting that there is long range allosteric coupling between domain 3 and the transmembrane domain. Similar results have been obtained with other RyR1 modulators, such as FK-506 binding protein and Imperatoxin A (IpTxa) (11Wagenknecht T. Radermacher M. Grassucci R. Berkowitz J. Xin H.B. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32463-32471Google Scholar, 36Samsó M. Trujillo R. Gurrola G.B. Valdivia H.H. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 493-499Google Scholar). Tripathy et al. (15Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Google Scholar) found that the kinetics of apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM binding to RyR1-enriched vesicles were sufficiently slow so as to preclude a mechanism of modulation by CaM in which it dissociates from one site and reassociates with the other with each cycle of contraction. To account for this result, they postulated that one of the CaM-binding sites present on RyR1 was occupied by both apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM. Our findings, as well as those of Rodney et al. (24Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B.Y. Zhang J.Z. Krol J. Pedersen S.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Google Scholar) and Yamaguchi et al. (25Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar), argue strongly for two distinct sites for apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM. Thus, it would appear that if the results of the kinetic studies and the evidence showing distinct sites for the two forms of CaM apply to the in vivo situation, then a mechanism for switching between the two sites must be non-dissociative in nature. Based on the relatively close positioning of apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM reported in this study, we propose a model whereby CaM switches between these two positions with the oscillating [Ca2+] responsible for the cycles of contraction-relaxation in skeletal muscle without dissociation from the RyR1. The necessity to capture another CaM molecule from the cytoplasmic pool would be avoided, allowing a fast response as has been reported (13Fuentes O. Valdivia C. Vaughan D. Coronado R. Valdivia H.H. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 305-316Google Scholar). Given the intracellular CaM concentration (2 μm in skeletal muscle (45Klee C.B. Vanaman T.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Google Scholar) and 50 μm in brain (1Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 229-274Google Scholar)) and the high affinity of RyR1 for apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM (Kd values both in the nanomolar range (14Yang H.C. Reedy M.M. Burke C.L. Strasburg G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 518-525Google Scholar, 15Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Google Scholar)), RyR1 could exist primarily as a complex with CaM, even at resting Ca2+ levels. Tripathy et al. (15Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Google Scholar) also suggested this scenario based upon the slow kinetics with which CaM dissociates from RyR1 relative to contraction/relaxation cycles. Recent evidence supports the preassociation of apoCaM with voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that are regulated by Ca2+-CaM, including the L-type channel (DHPR) that interacts with RyR1 at triad junctions (47Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Google Scholar). We propose that for pCa>6, apoCaM is bound to the apoCaM-binding site of RyR1. After Ca2+ release, CaM would lose affinity for the apoCaM site and increase affinity for the neighboring Ca2+-CaM site of RyR1. Several characteristics of CaM are consistent with a non-dissociative movement of a single CaM molecule between the two CaM binding sites: two structural and functional modules capable of binding to their targets independently and with different affinities (46Bayley P.M. Findlay W.A. Martin S.R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1215-1228Google Scholar), the ability to form stable complexes with only one domain bound (28Elshorst B. Hennig M. Forsterling H. Diener A. Maurer M. Schulte P. Schwalbe H. Griesinger C. Krebs J. Schmid H. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12320-12332Google Scholar), and the high flexibility of the tether region that connects the two modules (26Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Google Scholar). These properties could contribute to a scenario whereby the Ca2+-induced translocation of CaM (e.g. such as in the models depicted in Fig. 4A-C) is achieved by a two-step process with movement of one domain of CaM at a time. Thus, CaM could act as a mobile Ca2+-sensing subunit of RyR1 producing two alternative, opposite modulatory effects. Such coordinated CaM interactions could have a parallel in other proteins that bind apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM (20Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Google Scholar, 47Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Google Scholar, 48Qin N. Olcese R. Bransby M. Lin T. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2435-2438Google Scholar). The currently favored mechanism of E-C coupling in skeletal muscle, first proposed by Schneider and Chandler (49Schneider M.F. Chandler W.K. Nature. 1973; : 244-246Google Scholar), posits a “mechanical coupling” between RyR1 and the voltage sensor, identified as the DHPR (4Rios E. Brum G. Nature. 1987; 325: 717-720Google Scholar). According to this mechanism, the DHPR undergoes a voltage-dependent conformational change that in turn induces a conformational change in RyR1 through a physical coupling of the two receptors (for reviews, see Refs. 50Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 849-908Google Scholar, 51Meissner G. Lu X. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 399-408Google Scholar, 52Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29958-29964Google Scholar). A cytoplasmic region of the DHPR known as the II-III loop has been strongly implicated in the interaction with the RyR1 that mediates E-C coupling (53Lu X.Y. Xu L. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6511-6516Google Scholar). Previously we mapped the binding location on RyR1 of IpTxa, a peptide that mimics a portion of the II-III loop of DHPR but binds with much higher affinity to RyR1 than the II-III loop itself (54Gurrola G.B. Arevalo C. Sreekumar R. Lokuta A.J. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7879-7886Google Scholar). IpTxa was found to bind within the crevices formed by RyR1's domains 3 and 6/8 (36Samsó M. Trujillo R. Gurrola G.B. Valdivia H.H. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 493-499Google Scholar), which are near to and perhaps overlapping the binding location Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 3, E and F). Most likely, additional regions of the RyR1, particularly within domain 3 and the clamps (domains 5–10), are involved in the interaction with DHPR (31Samsó M. Wagenknecht T. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 121: 172-180Google Scholar, 52Leong P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29958-29964Google Scholar, 55Block B.A. Imagawa T. Campbell K.P. Franzini-Armstrong C. J.

The existence of two closely spaced but distinct sites for apoCaM and Ca2+-CaM on RyR1, together with the proximity of these sites to a region of RyR1 that potentially interacts with DHPR, leads us to speculate that CaM might play a more direct role in the molecular mechanism of E-C coupling than previously considered (6Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 244-251Google Scholar, 13Fuentes O. Valdivia C. Vaughan D. Coronado R. Valdivia H.H. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 305-316Google Scholar, 15Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G.

https://openalex.org/W2169816639,"Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation stimulates stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), which is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily and implicated in stress-induced apoptosis. UV also induces the activation of another MAPK member, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which is typically involved in a growth-signaling cascade. However, the UV-induced signaling pathway leading to ERK activation, together with the physiological role, has remained unknown. Here we examined the molecular mechanism and physiological function of UV-induced ERK activation in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells that retain a high number of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors. UV-induced ERK activation was accompanied with the Tyr phosphorylation of EGF receptors, and both responses were completely abolished in the presence of a selective EGF receptor inhibitor (AG1478) or the Src inhibitor PP2 and by the expression of a kinase-dead Src mutant. On the other hand, SAPK/JNK activation by UV was partially inhibited by these inhibitors. UV stimulated Src activity in a manner similar to the ERK activation, but the Src activation was insensitive to AG1478. UV-induced cell apoptosis measured by DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 activation was enhanced by AG1478 and an ERK kinase inhibitor (U0126) but inhibited by EGF receptor stimulation by the agonist. These results indicate that UV-induced ERK activation, which provides a survival signal against stress-induced apoptosis, is mediated through Src-dependent Tyr phosphorylation of EGF receptors. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation stimulates stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), which is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily and implicated in stress-induced apoptosis. UV also induces the activation of another MAPK member, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which is typically involved in a growth-signaling cascade. However, the UV-induced signaling pathway leading to ERK activation, together with the physiological role, has remained unknown. Here we examined the molecular mechanism and physiological function of UV-induced ERK activation in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells that retain a high number of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors.

Several intracellular molecules responsible for UV-induced cell apoptosis have recently been identified by means of gene targeting in mice. For example, cytochrome c (1Li K. Li Y. Shelton J.M.

In addition, the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK),1 which is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, appears to play an important role in UV response (6Derijard B.

JNK-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts exhibited a defective apoptosis in response to UV irradiation and impaired mitochondria functions (8Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K.

We have also reported that two MAPK activators, SEK1/MKK4 and SEK2/MKK7, are both required for UV-induced synergistic activation of SAPK/JNK in murine ES cells (9Wada T. Nakagawa K. Watanabe T.

Thus, a signaling pathway leading to cell apoptosis has been proposed by Davis (10Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3570) Google Scholar) and other groups as follows: UV → SEK1 and MKK7 → SAPK/JNK → mitochondria → cytochromec → Apaf-1 → caspase 9 → caspase 3. In an early study that had been reported before the discovery of SAPK/JNK involvement in cell apoptosis, Devary et al. (11Devary Y. Gottlieb R. Smeal T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 71: 1081-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) observed that UV irradiation induces the activation of Src, Ha-Ras, and Raf-1 and the phosphorylation of c-Jun in HeLa cells. This finding suggested that UV response also has a cell survival function and is initiated at the cell surface membrane rather than within the nucleus. The same group (12Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) has recently shown that the strong SAPK/JNK activation by UV was triggered by the activation of membrane receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF), tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-1. Thus, the signaling pathway from UV to SAPK/JNK stimulation appeared to involve the activation of cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors. On the other hand, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), another member of the MAPK superfamily, is typically activated in response to growth factors such as EGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Interestingly, recent studies (13Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M. Peppelenbosch M. Bos J.L. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar) have revealed that UV irradiation induces the activation of ERK in a number of cell types and that the UV-induced ERK activation also involves the activation of EGF receptors. However, upstream molecules responsible for the EGF receptor stimulation and the physiological role(s) of ERK activation in UV irradiation have not been fully determined. In the present study, we examined the effects of various inhibitors for EGF receptors, tyrosine kinases, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) on the UV-induced activation of ERK and SAPK/JNK in murine ES cells and the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431. The contribution of UV-induced ERK activation to cell apoptosis was further investigated by measuring DNA fragmentation and caspase activity. Our present results clearly indicate that the UV-induced activation of ERK is mediated through the phosphorylation of EGF receptors by Src tyrosine kinase and that ERK activation functions as a cell survival signal rather than in apoptosis. Instead, the UV-induced activation of SAPK/JNK, which appears to contribute to the apoptotic pathway, was partially dependent on the Src-induced EGF receptor activation. The murine ES cell line E14K (wild type) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum and leukemia inhibitory factor as described previously (14Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The human cell line A431 was maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The cells grown at 80% confluent were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4) for 12 h. The cells were stimulated with UV-C type (1 kJ/m2 for ∼1 min or 0.1 kJ/m2 for ∼0.1 min) using a 254-nm wavelength DNA Stratalinker (Stratagene) in the presence or absence of inhibitors and subjected to the assays of kinase activity, Tyr phosphorylation, caspase 3 activity, and DNA fragmentation as described below. Mouse EGF was purchased from Toyobo Co., Ltd. The EGF receptor-specific inhibitor AG1478 and the Src family-specific inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chloropheny)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo [3,4-d] pyrimidine (PP2) were obtained from Calbiochem. Genistein, wortmannin, and the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)-specific inhibitor U0126 were purchased from Wako Chemicals, Sigma, and Promega, respectively. Antibodies (Abs) specific for ERK1 (C-16), ERK2 (C-14), SAPK/JNK1 (C-17 and FL), Lyn kinase (cat. no. 44), and EGF receptor (cat. no. 1005) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-v-Src (OP07) and anti-EGF receptor (GR01) Abs were from Calbiochem. An anti-phospho-Tyr (PY20) Ab was from BD Transduction Laboratories. A cDNA encoding a kinase-defective, dominant inhibitory form of Src (SrcK298M), with Lys-298 mutated to Met, was cloned into mammalian expression vector pME-18S. For gene expression analysis, A431 cells were plated to ∼50% confluence and transfected 1 day later with expression vectors using the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen). The cells, after being cultured for a half-day, were serum-starved for 12 h and subsequently stimulated with UV irradiation (1 kJ/m2). Cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. A431 cells (∼1 × 106 cells) were suspended at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of a lysis buffer consisting of 1% Nonidet P-40, 80 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 4 mm Na3VO4, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 mm phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were incubated with the anti-EGF receptor monoclonal Ab (GR01) at 4 °C for 2 h, and the immunocomplexes were washed three times with the lysis buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with the anti-EGF receptor (number 1005), anti-phospho-Tyr (PY20), and anti-v-Src (OP07) Abs. The bands were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate for the development of immunoblots utilizing a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second Ab according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). MAPK proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 2 h using the anti-SAPK/JNK (C-17) and anti-ERK (C-16 and C-14) Abs. The SAPK/JNK and ERK activities in the precipitated fractions were measured with GST-c-Jun and the myelin basic protein (MBP), respectively, as in vitro substrates in the presence of 60 μm[γ-32P]ATP as described previously (14Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 15Nishina H.

Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The amounts of the precipitated SAPK/JNK and ERK that had been monitored by immunoblotting with the anti-SAPK/JNK (FL) and anti-ERK (C-16 and C-14) Abs, respectively, were almost constant in a series of the present experiments. A431 cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and 4 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-Src (OP07) and anti-Lyn (cat. no. 44) Abs. The immunoprecipitants were washed twice with the lysis buffer, twice with a tyrosine kinase buffer consisting of 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, and 3 mm MnCl2 and resuspended in 30 ml of the tyrosine kinase buffer containing 2.5 μg of acid-treated enolase and 60 μm[γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. The amounts of the precipitated Src and Lyn were normalized by immunoblotting with the anti-Src and anti-Lyn Abs. A431 cells (∼1 × 106 cells), which had been attached to and detached from culture dishes after UV irradiation, were collected by means of incubation with trypsin/EDTA and centrifugation, respectively. The cells were mixed, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and collected by centrifugation. After removing the supernatants, the cells were lysed in 0.33 ml of a buffer consisting of 5 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The cell lysates were subjected to phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation for DNA purification. The precipitated DNA was suspended in 20 ml of H2O and treated with 20 μg/ml of RNase for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA samples (20 μl) were subjected to electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by a UV illuminator. A431 cells (∼1 × 106 cells) in culture dishes were harvested as described above and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells, after being resuspended in 50 μl of a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride, were frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 37 °C three times. The cell lysates (40 μg) were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 20 μm DEVD-MCA in the final volume of 50 μl in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The reaction was terminated by adding 450 μl of ice-cold H2O, and substrate cleavage leading to the release of free MCA (excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm) was monitored at room temperature. All experiments were repeated at least three times with different batches of the cell samples, and the results were fully reproducible. Hence, most of the data shown are representative of several independent experiments. We recently reported that UV irradiation activates not only SAPK/JNK but also ERK in murine ES cells. The former activation was more profoundly and slowly observed than the latter one (9Wada T. Nakagawa K. Watanabe T. Nishitai G. Seo J. Kishimoto H. Kitagawa D. Sasaki T. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30892-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of EGF receptors appears to be involved in UV responses (12Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 13Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M. Peppelenbosch M. Bos J.L. Kruijer W. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate signaling pathways leading to the activation of two MAPKs, the effect of an EGF receptor kinase inhibitor, AG1478, was first investigated in ES cells. ERK and SAPK/JNK activities in response to UV irradiation (1 kJ/m2) were measured at 5 and 15 min, respectively, by their abilities to phosphorylate MBP and GST-c-Jun as substrates. In accordance with the previous report (9Wada T. Nakagawa K. Watanabe T. Nishitai G. Seo J. Kishimoto H. Kitagawa D. Sasaki T. Penninger J.M. Nishina H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30892-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), UV irradiation induced the activation of two MAPKs in ES cells; the ERK activation (Fig.1A, lane 2) was weaker than the SAPK/JNK activation (Fig. 1B, lane 2) but significant and reproducible. AG1478 almost completely inhibited the UV-induced ERK activation (Fig. 1A, lane 3). However, inhibition of the SAPK/JNK activation by AG1478 was partial (Fig. 1B, lane 3). When ES cells were stimulated with EGF, there was significant stimulation of ERK (Fig.1A, lane 4), suggesting the presence of growth factor receptors in the ES cells. In contrast, EGF-induced SAPK/JNK activation was very weak compared with UV irradiation (Fig.1B, lane 4). These results suggest that the activation of EGF receptors is essentially required for UV-induced ERK activation and partially involved in SAPK/JNK activation in ES cells. The involvement of EGF receptors in UV-induced ERK activation was further investigated in A431 cells, which express a large number of the growth factor receptors. Fig.2 shows the time courses of ERK and SAPK/JNK activation in response to UV irradiation in A431 cells. UV-induced ERK activation was more evident in A431 cells than in ES cells, and maximally 4–5-fold stimulation was transiently observed at 10 min (Fig. 2B). UV irradiation also induced marked stimulation of SAPK/JNK activity (>30-fold increase), and this response was characterized by a slow onset but sustained stimulation; the maximum level was observed at 15 min and maintained until 30 min (Fig. 2D). Fig. 3 summarizes the effects of various kinase inhibitors on the UV-induced ERK and SAPK/JNK activation in A431 cells. The EGF receptor kinase inhibitor AG1478 completely inhibited the UV-induced ERK activation (Fig. 3B), as has been observed in ES cells. However, inhibition by AG1478 of UV-induced SAPK/JNK activation was again partial in A431 cells (Fig.3D). Interestingly, a Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2, inhibited the ERK activation almost completely and also induced a 50% inhibition of SAPK/JNK activity. UV-induced ERK activation but not SAPK/JNK activation was sensitive to a non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein. However, a PI 3-K inhibitor, wortmannin, did not exert any influence on the ERK or SAPK/JNK activation. Thus, it is very likely that the UV-induced ERK activation is completely dependent on the activation of EGF receptors and Src or Src family tyrosine kinase(s). On the contrary, the UV-induced SAPK/JNK activation appeared to be partially dependent on the tyrosine kinases. To identify the Src family member responsible for the EGF receptor activation, we next investigated whether Src activity is stimulated by UV irradiation in A431 cells. Lyn kinase activity was also investigated because it has been reported that tyrosine kinase is involved in DNA damage-induced activation of SAPK/JNK (16Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The kinase activities were measured with enolase as the substrates in fractions immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. Fig.4 shows the time courses of Src and Lyn kinase activities after UV irradiation. UV-induced Src activation was apparently observed at 1 min, and there was a progressive increase in the kinase activity as the incubation time was increased. This time course was comparable with that of UV-induced ERK activation. However, no activation of Lyn was observed during the 10-min incubation. We also questioned the effect of AG1478 on the UV-induced Src activation (Fig.4, right column). In contrast to the UV-induced ERK activation, the EGF receptor kinase inhibitor did not exert any influence on the Src activation. These results suggest that UV-induced Src activation may be located upstream of EGF receptors. We also investigated whether UV irradiation induces Tyr phosphorylation of EGF receptors in comparison with the action of the receptor agonist. The Tyr-phosphorylated form of EGF receptors was measured with a monoclonal Ab (PY20) that specifically recognized phosphorylated Tyr residues. As shown in Fig. 5A, EGF receptors were rapidly Tyr-phosphorylated after UV irradiation. The UV-induced phosphorylation was completely abolished in the presence of AG1478. In addition, PP2 and genistein, which inhibited UV-induced ERK activation, had inhibitory effects on the receptor phosphorylation. However, wortmannin failed to inhibit the UV-induced receptor phosphorylation. The effects of these inhibitors on the phosphorylation of EGF receptors by the native agonist EGF were also examined (Fig.5B). As expected, AG1478 markedly reduced the EGF-induced receptor phosphorylation. In contrast, PP2 and genistein did not inhibit the action of EGF. These results clearly excluded the possibility that the loss of UV-induced receptor phosphorylation observed in the presence of PP2 or genistein resulted from the impairment of EGF receptor/kinase integrity. Thus, it is very likely that Src is located upstream of EGF receptors and that the tyrosine kinase may phosphorylate the growth factor receptors directly or indirectly. Furthermore, we examined the effect of kinase-dead Src, SrcK298M, on the UV-induced phosphorylation of EGF receptors. As shown in Fig. 6, the UV-induced phosphorylation was completely abolished by an overexpression of SrcK298M. Interestingly, UV-induced association of Src with EGF receptor-immunocomplex was also decreased by the expression of SrcK298M. These results clearly show that Src is involved in the UV-induced phosphorylation of EGF receptors and suggest that the translocation of Src into the EGF receptor complex triggers the phosphorylation.Figure 6The effects of kinase-dead Src, SrcK298M, on UV-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation in A431 cells. A431 cells (∼1 × 106 cells) were transfected with 3 μg of pME-18S vector alone (control) or pME-18S SrcK298M vector. The transfected cells, after being starved for 12 h, were stimulated with UV radiation (1 kJ/m2) and further incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-EGF receptor Ab. Tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptors were determined by an anti-phospho-Tyr Ab, and the amounts of the precipitated Src kinases or EGF receptors (EGFR) were monitored by immunoblotting with their specific Abs. The cell lysates were also analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-v-Src Ab.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To elucidate the physiological role of UV-induced ERK activation, we finally examined whether the inhibition or stimulation of ERK activation exerts its influence on UV-induced apoptosis. A431 cells were first treated with AG1478 or an ERK kinase inhibitor, U0126, and subjected to weak UV irradiation (0.1 kJ/m2). DNA fragmentation was monitored by electrophoresis, and caspase 3 activity was also measured with DEVD-MCA as a substrate. As shown in Fig.7A, DNA fragmentation observed with weak UV irradiation was markedly enhanced by the prior treatment of A431 cells with AG1478 or U0126. Potentiation by AG1478 or U0126 was also observed in terms of UV-induced caspase 3 activation. As shown in Fig. 7B, the time-dependent caspase activation in response to UV irradiation was significantly enhanced by the kinase inhibitors. These results indicate that Src and EGF receptor-dependent ERK activation is implicated in an early protective role against UV irradiation. The above idea predicted that stimulation of EGF receptors with the agonist might protect cell apoptosis from UV irradiation. To test this prediction, A431 cells were pretreated with EGF before UV irradiation. As shown in Fig. 7C, UV-induced activation of caspase 3 was dramatically inhibited by the prior treatment (3 or 6 h) of the cells with EGF (5 ng/ml). The protective effect of EGF became more apparent as the pretreatment time was prolonged (Fig. 7C) or the concentration of EGF was increased (data not shown). These results again indicate that EGF receptor-dependent ERK activation plays a protective role in UV-induced cell apoptosis. Recent reports (6Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 561-569PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that UV irradiation produces a variety of early responses such as activation of cell surface receptors for EGF, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-1 and stimulation of Src, SAPK/JNK, and ERK. The UV responses may be divided into two separate signaling pathways leading to SAPK/JNK and ERK activation: 1) UV → cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase(s), etc. → SAPK/JNK activation → apoptosis and 2) UV → EGF receptors → ERK activation. However, it remained to be determined how Src activation contributes to the UV-induced signaling pathways. Furthermore, the physiological role of the ERK activation was not apparent in stress-induced cell apoptosis. Our present experiments basically confirmed and further extended the above signaling pathways as follows (Fig. 8). First, UV-induced ERK activation in A431 cells (and ES cells) appeared to be mediated through Src-dependent Tyr phosphorylation of EGF receptors. UV-induced ERK activation was completely abolished in the presence of the EGF receptor kinase inhibitor AG1478 and the Src inhibitor PP2 (Figs. 1 and 3). UV irradiation induced Src activation in a manner similar to the ERK activation, but AG1478 failed to inhibit the Src activation (Figs. 2 and 4). Lyn tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for DNA damage-induced SAPK/JNK activation (16Yoshida K. Weichselbaum R. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5370-5380Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was not stimulated by UV irradiation at the early stages (Fig. 4). PP2 and AG1478, together with the expression of kinase-dead Src SrcK298M, inhibited UV-induced Tyr phosphorylation of EGF receptors (Figs. 5 and6). In contrast, UV-induced activation of SAPK/JNK, which appears to be responsible for apoptotic responses, was partially inhibited by AG1478 and PP2 (Figs. 1 and 3). This indicates that a UV-induced pathway(s) other than the EGF receptor activation may also contribute to SAPK/JNK activation. One of these would be a pathway activated by PP2-sensitive Src (or Src-like tyrosine kinase) but not mediated by EGF receptor phosphorylation (see Fig. 8). Second, UV-induced ERK activation played a survival role against apoptosis. DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 activation induced by UV irradiation were markedly enhanced by AG1478 and the ERK kinase inhibitor U0126 (Fig. 6,A and B). On the contrary, UV-induced caspase 3 activation was significantly reduced by the stimulation of EGF receptors (Fig. 7C). It has been reported (17Black H.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 46: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 18Cerutti P.A. Trump B.F. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar) that a reactive oxygen species (ROS) is generated in response to UV irradiation and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in various cell types. Quite recently, Chen et al. (19Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) reported that SAPK/JNK activation by H2O2 also involves Src-dependent EGF receptor activation in human endothelial cells. However, their results are somewhat different from ours in the following points. JNK activation by H2O2 in the endothelial cells is completely inhibited by high concentrations of AG1478 and PP2. These authors discussed the possibility that the upstream Src rather than EGF receptor itself may be the target of AG1478 used at a high concentration. However, the inhibition of H2O2-induced ERK activation by the inhibitors was partial in the endothelial cells (19Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol.

These findings suggest that signaling pathways induced by UV irradiation may not be totally dependent on the actions of H2O2, although Src-dependent EGF receptor activation is commonly observed in stress-activated cells. In addition, Fritz and Kaina (20Fritz G. Kaina B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1768-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reported that the PI 3-K inhibitor wortmannin specifically blocked the UV-induced JNK activation but did not affect UV-induced ERK activation in NIH3T3 cells. However, we did not observe any inhibitory effect of wortmannin on UV-induced JNK activation or EGF receptor phosphorylation in A431 cells (Figs. 3 and5). Chen et al. (19Chen K. Vita J.A. Berk B.C. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16045-16050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) have also described no inhibitory effect of the PI 3-K inhibitor LY294002 on H2O2-induced JNK activation in human endothelial cells. These results suggest that stress-induced signaling pathways may be different among the types of stress signals and cells. Further experiments concerning molecular mechanisms for the stress-sensing early steps (see Fig. 8) would be required for understanding how these stress signals display different sensitivities to various inhibitors. In this regard, it is very interesting to note here that Src-dependent EGF receptor activation is also observed upon stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (21Luttrell L.M. Rocca G.J.D. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 22Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7023-7044Crossref Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Stimulation of lysophosphatidic acid and adrenergic α2 receptors by the agonists activated a Ras-dependent MAPK pathway (21Luttrell L.M. Rocca G.J.D. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). This MAPK activation was mediated through the phosphorylation of EGF receptors by Src, and the phosphorylation appeared to have resulted from the action of the βγ subunits of Gi-type G proteins. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that UV-induced Src and EGF receptor activation may arise from cell surface membrane components such as receptor-like molecules or G protein subunits. Indeed, a recent report (23Nishida M. Maruyama Y. Tanaka R. Kontani K. Nagao T. Kurose H. Nature. 2000; 408: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) suggested that G protein α subunits are directly activated by reactive oxygen species. In summary, the present results indicate that UV-induced ERK activation is mediated through EGF receptor phosphorylation by Src tyrosine kinase and that this signaling pathway plays a critical role in the rapid anti-apoptotic response by inducing gene expression. It is quite reasonable that UV-irradiated cells, which are not damaged enough to undergo apoptosis, survive by utilizing this anti-apoptotic pathway. Conversely, UV activation of this pathway may enhance the survival of mutated cells, thereby promoting cancer initiated by the stress signal."

To investigate the molecular mechanism of anti-inflammation, we analyzed the regulation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) expression in macrophages, a key step in inflammation, by the antioxidants. Whereas lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an inflammatory inducer, stimulates rapid synthesis of TNF-α protein, phenolic antioxidants, exemplified bytert-butyl hydroquinone and 1,4-dihydroquinone, block LPS-induced production of TNF-α protein in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of TNF-α induction correlates with the capacity of the antioxidants to undergo oxidation-reduction cycling, implicating oxidative signaling in the inhibition. The antioxidants blocked LPS-induced increase of the steady-state mRNA of TNF-α but did not affect the half-life of the mRNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay reveals a total inhibition of LPS-induced formation of nuclear factor κB·DNA binding complexes by phenolic antioxidants. Finally, 1,4-dihydroquinone blocks the induction of TNF-α target genes interleukin 1β and interleukin 6 at both mRNA and protein levels. Our findings demonstrate that phenolic antioxidants potently inhibit signal-induced TNF-α transcription and suggest a mechanism of anti-inflammation by the antioxidants through control of cytokine induction during inflammation.

Synthetic phenolic antioxidants, such as tBHQ,1 are commonly used as food preservatives due to their potent anti-lipid peroxidation activity (5Verhugen H. Schilderman P.A.E.L. Kleinjans J.C.S. Chem.

The broad spectrum of the biological functions of the antioxidants suggests the existence of multiple molecular targets that mediate diverse responses to the chemicals in cells and whole animals. Identifying the target molecules can facilitate the design of better preventive and/or therapeutic agents for protection against pathological responses to various occupational, environmental, or therapeutic chemicals as well as against certain conditions associated with aging, such as cancer and chronic inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. Current understanding of the mechanism of action by phenolic antioxidants comes mostly from studies on the induction of phase II detoxification enzymes by the antioxidants. Phase II enzymes, such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (15Ernster L. Estabrook R.W. Hochstein P. Orrenius S. DT-diaphorase: A Quinone Reductase with Special Functions in Cell Metabolism and Detoxication. Vol. 27A. Cambridge University Press, New York1987: 1-207Google Scholar, 16Ma Q. Cui K. Xiao F.

Biochem. 1989; 58: 743-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), metabolize chemicals to water-soluble products through reduction and conjugation reactions. Induction of phase II enzymes alters the metabolic fate of chemicals by enhancing their metabolism and excretion. Induction of glutathioneS-transferase A1 and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase by phenolic antioxidants requires an ARE located in the enhancers of the genes (18Favreau L. Pickett C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rushmore T.H. King R.G. Paulson K.E. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3826-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and is mediated through an Nrf2-dependent signal transduction (20Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Htayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3145) Google Scholar). Nrf2 is a member of the Cap'n Colar bZip family of transcription factors (21Chan K. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12731-12736Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) that forms a cytoplasmic complex with Keap1 (22Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar). Upon exposure to phenolic chemicals, Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1, translocates into the nucleus, dimerizes with an as-yet-unidentified partner transcription factor, and mediates the transcription of target genes through ARE-dependent transcription. Studies on Nrf2-null mice revealed that loss of expression of Nrf2 markedly enhances the susceptibility of the mice to toxicity by acetaminophen (23Chan K. Han X.-D. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4611-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) or cancer by benzo(a)pyrene (24Ramos-Gomez M. Kwak M.-K. Dolan P.M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Kensler T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3410-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar), which is attributable to diminished detoxification of the chemicals in the Nrf2-null mice. Thus, induction of phase II enzymes through Nrf2 can account for chemoprotection by phenolic antioxidants against certain carcinogens and toxins by altering the pharmacokinetic fate of the chemicals. However, such mechanisms do not readily explain the anti-inflammatory function of the antioxidants, which is largely unaddressed at present. The importance of inflammation in the pathological responses to chemicals of endogenous or foreign origin is well recognized because more diseases, ranging from silicosis, asthma, and chronic hepatitis to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, and certain forms of neoplasia, manifest an inflammatory component that either causes or increases the severity of the diseases (25Luster M.I. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: A418-A419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wills-Karp M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar, 27Pohl L.R.

Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). Inflammation, in general, is a directed tissue response to tissue damage caused by noxious and injurious stimuli. Inflammation serves to isolate the injured tissue, inactivate the toxic stimuli, and repair the tissue damage. In many cases, however, inflammation can lead to further tissue damage and the development of inflammatory diseases. Thus, inhibition of inflammation constitutes an effective mechanism of chemoprotection against chemical-induced inflammatory lesions or disease conditions. Inflammatory stimuli induce cytokines, which mediate tissue responses in different phases of inflammation in a sequential and concerted manner (28Laskin D.L. Pendino K.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 655-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Regulation of cytokine induction serves as a key mechanism of inflammation control by endogenous or exogenous chemicals. TNF-α is produced in the early phase of inflammation in cells of reticuloendothelial origin, such as macrophages. TNF-α mediates early-stage responses of inflammation by regulating the production of other cytokines, including IL-1β and IL-6. Cumulative evidence indicates that abnormalities in the production or function of TNF-α play essential roles in many inflammatory lesions (25Luster M.I. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: A418-A419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar, 30Feldmann M. Maini R.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 163-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). For instance, exposure to the bacterial endotoxin LPS can cause inflammatory liver damage and septic shock. Induction of TNF-α by LPS is a key step in the response; administration of TNF-α mimics the response, whereas blocking the function of TNF-α by using neutralizing agents of TNF-α protects animals from the LPS-induced lesions. The pivotal role of TNF-α in inflammation and the potent anti-inflammatory activity of phenolic antioxidants raise the question of whether the induction of TNF-α during inflammation serves as a target of anti-inflammation by phenolic antioxidants. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of phenolic antioxidants on the induction of TNF-α by LPS in macrophage cells. Our data reveal that phenolic antioxidants block LPS-induced expression of TNF-α both time- and dose-dependently; the inhibition occurs at a transcriptional level and involves inhibition of NF-κB activation, the major regulator of TNF-α transcription in macrophage cells. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of inhibition of signal-induced TNF-α production by phenolic chemicals. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of chemoprotection against inflammatory diseases by phenolic antioxidants. Restriction endonucleases and other general molecular biology reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and Promega (Madison, WI). Radioactive compounds were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. LPS, tBHQ, HQ, catechol, resorcinol, para-benzoquinone, α-naphthoflavone, and NAC were purchased from Sigma. Cell culture materials were from Invitrogen. Reagents for Northern blotting and ELISA are as described below. The mouse monocyte-macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The macrophage cells were grown as a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. The cells were treated with LPS, phenolic antioxidants, or other reagents as described in the figure legends; Me2SO or water was used as the solvent control for the antioxidants and LPS, respectively. cDNA fragments for mouse TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and HO-1 were synthesized by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA templates fromCLONTECH using the primer sets specific for each mouse gene from the same company. The cDNAs were subcloned into the pCRII TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), verified by sequencing, and used to generate riboprobes for the corresponding mRNA species. A mouse actin cDNA fragment (∼500 bp) was used to generate a riboprobe for actin. The riboprobes were synthesized in the presence of digoxygenin-UTP using a digoxygenin labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA (5 μg each lane) was fractionated on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Nytran membrane by capillary action. After UV cross-linking, the membrane was hybridized overnight with a digoxygenin-labeled riboprobe at 68 °C. Signals were visualized by chemiluminescence using a digoxygenin RNA detection kit with CDP star as a substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Quantitation of the blotting result was performed by using the ImageQuaNT program (Molecular Dynamics, San Jose, CA). All data were corrected for loading variations by comparing the amount of actin of each sample analyzed. The macrophage cells were plated in a 48-well cell culture dish at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in 500 μl of medium. The cells were grown at 37 °C for 24 h before treatment. In a typical experiment, the cells were treated with a phenolic antioxidant or Me2SO for 1 h, followed by stimulation with LPS for 5 h. The medium was collected and assayed for TNF-α, IL-1β, or IL-6 by using ELISA kits specific for each of the murine cytokines from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). For TNF-α and IL-6, the medium was diluted with water at a 1:20 or 1:10 ratio, respectively; 50 μl of each diluted sample was used for ELISA. Quantitation of the ELISA results was performed using a Microplate Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) set to 450 nm and corrected for absorbance at 570 nm according to the manufacturer's instructions. The nuclear extracts were prepared with a three-step procedure as described elsewhere (31Ye J. Shi X. Jones W. Rojanasakul Y. Cheng N. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Castronova V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L426-L434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were grown in a 100-mm dish to near confluence. After treatment, the cells were collected with a rubber policeman, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 500 μl of a lysis buffer on ice for 4 min. The lysis buffer contains 50 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm1,4-dithiothreitol. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min in a microcentrifuge. In the second step, the pellet (the nuclei fraction) was washed once in washing buffer (lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40). In the final step, the nuclei were treated with an extraction buffer, which contains 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and several other reagents as in the lysis buffer. The nuclei/extraction buffer mixture was frozen at −80 °C and then thawed on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was collected as the nuclear extract and stored at −80 °C for further use. A NF-κB DNA-binding sequence (5′-GATTTTCCCATGAGTCT-3′) was used to synthesize oligonucleotides as the NF-κB binding probe (31Ye J. Shi X. Jones W. Rojanasakul Y. Cheng N. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Castronova V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L426-L434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The complementary single-strand oligomers were denatured at 80 °C for 5 min and annealed at room temperature. An activator protein (AP)-1 DNA-binding sequence derived from the AP-1 binding site in the collagenase enhancer was used as a nonspecific competitor probe (31Ye J. Shi X. Jones W. Rojanasakul Y. Cheng N. Schwegler-Berry D. Baron P. Deye G.J. Li C. Castronova V. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: L426-L434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [32P]ATP using T4 kinase (New England Biolabs). The DNA-protein binding reaction was conducted in a 24-μl reaction mixture containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), 3 μg of nuclear extract, 3 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 12 μl of a reaction buffer (12% glycerol, 24 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 8 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol). The mixture was incubated on ice for 10–20 min, followed by the addition of 4 × 104 counts/min of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe; the incubation was continued at room temperature for 20 min. For competition experiments, 100 ng of cold (unlabeled) double-stranded NF-κB or AP-1 probe was added to the reaction mixture for competition with labeled NF-κB probe. For supershift assays, antibodies specific for the p50 or p65 subunit of NF-κB, c-Jun, NF-AT, or c-Fos were added to the reaction mixture respectively (2 μg/reaction). The antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The DNA·protein complexes were resolved in a 5% acrylamide gel (pre-run at 170 V for 30 min with 0.5× Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer) at 200 V for 90 min and visualized by exposure to films. Macrophage cells were plated in a 6-well dish at 5 × 105 cells/well 16 h before treatment. 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (5 μm; Sigma) was used to stain cells for H2O2 for 45 min before the treatment was completed. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline using a rubber policeman for quantitation of H2O2 by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis (32Ye J. Wang S. Leonard S.S. Sun Y. Butterworth L. Antonini J. Ding M. Rojanasakul Y. Vallyathan V. Castronova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34974-34980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate was excited at 488 nm and detected at 525 nm. Lactate dehydrogenase activity in cell culture medium was measured by using a lactate dehydrogenase kit from Roche Diagnostics Corp. (Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by using the COBAS chemistry system FARA (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) and expressed in units/liter. Protein concentration was determined by using the Bradford method (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214351) Google Scholar) with reagents from Bio-Rad. To analyze the mechanism of anti-inflammation by phenolic antioxidants, we examined the effect of the chemicals on signal-induced production of TNF-α in macrophage cells. tBHQ and HQ, two prototypical phenolic antioxidants, were chosen as testing agents in the study. Little TNF-α protein was detected by ELISA specific for mouse TNF-α in controls (Fig. 1A,DMSO). tBHQ or HQ alone does not affect TNF-α production (Fig. 1A, tBHQ and HQ). Upon exposure to LPS, large quantities of TNF-α were produced, and the induction was inhibited by tBHQ or HQ (Fig. 1A, compare LPSwith tBHQ+LPS and HQ+LPS). Thus, tBHQ or HQ totally blocks LPS-induced production of TNF-α protein in macrophages. Next, we analyzed the time- and concentration-response curves. As shown in Fig. 1B, LPS induces a 5-fold increase in TNF-α production within 1 h after treatment, reaching a maximum of ∼300-fold at 5 h. The maximum induction is maintained for over 24 h. HQ blocks the induction of TNF-α by LPS throughout the testing time course. These results suggest that inhibition of TNF-α production by HQ occurs early and is therefore likely to be a primary response; furthermore, the inhibition is complete and long-lasting. HQ inhibits LPS-induced TNF-α production dose-dependently (Fig. 1C). The IC50 value of the inhibition by HQ is ∼15 μm, which is similar to the potency of HQ for other biological responses, such as the induction of phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes (34Prestera T. Holtzclaw W.D. Zhang Y. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibition by HQ is potent and may be mediated through a mechanism analogous to the induction of phase II enzymes by phenolic antioxidants. tBHQ inhibits LPS-induced TNF-α production both time- and dose-dependently in a manner similar to that of HQ (data not shown). Certain phenolic chemicals undergo oxidation-reduction cycling in cells. We tested whether the inhibition of TNF-α production by phenolic chemicals involves redox cycling of the chemicals. HQ, catechol, and resorcinol are structural analogs of diphenols, which differ with regard to the positions of hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring. HQ and catechol undergo facile reversible oxidations to the corresponding quinones, whereas resorcinol can not. HQ and catechol strongly inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α production; in contrast, resorcinol is inactive for the inhibition (Fig. 2A). To exclude cell toxicity as a possible cause of the inhibition, we measured lactate dehydrogenase activity in the medium, which reflects cellular damage. As shown in Fig. 2B, LPS, HQ, catechol, and resorcinol did not cause a significant increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity, given either alone or in combination. These data demonstrate that the antioxidants do not cause marked damage to the cells at the concentrations tested. Several related chemicals were similarly tested for inhibition of TNF-α induction (Fig. 2A). Phenol, which has a single hydroxyl group, does not inhibit TNF-α production at 100 μm. para-Benzoquinone, which is reduced to hydroquinone through a number of reductive pathways (15Ernster L. Estabrook R.W. Hochstein P. Orrenius S. DT-diaphorase: A Quinone Reductase with Special Functions in Cell Metabolism and Detoxication. Vol. 27A. Cambridge University Press, New York1987: 1-207Google Scholar), exhibits dose-dependent inhibition with a potency similar to that of HQ (IC50 = ∼15 μm). α-Naphthoflavone (ANF), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon that is metabolized to oxidizable products in cells (34Prestera T. Holtzclaw W.D. Zhang Y. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), inhibits TNF-α production, whereas 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodiben-zo-p-dioxin (TCDD), which is metabolically stable, does not. These data demonstrate that inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-α production by phenolic antioxidants correlates with the oxidation-reduction capability of the chemicals. LPS stimulates the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H2O2, in macrophages (35Sanlioglu S. Williams C.M. Samavati L. Butler N.S. Wang G. McCray Jr., P.B. Ritchie T.C. Hunninghake G.W. Zandi E. Engelhardt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30188-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We tested whether phenolic antioxidants affect LPS-induced ROS production. As shown in Fig. 3A, LPS induces a marked increase in H2O2; tBHQ or HQ blocks LPS-induced H2O2 production. Resorcinol does not affect H2O2 induction. This observation can be explained in two ways: first, the LPS-induced ROS production and its inhibition by the antioxidants are unrelated to TNF-α induction and inhibition; alternatively, they are integral to the LPS response and the antioxidant action. To test the possibilities, we examined whether ROS inhibitors block TNF-α induction. NAC, which inhibits LPS-induced H2O2 production in macrophages (35Sanlioglu S. Williams C.M. Samavati L. Butler N.S. Wang G. McCray Jr., P.B. Ritchie T.C. Hunninghake G.W. Zandi E. Engelhardt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30188-30198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), inhibits TNF-α induction in a manner similar to that of HQ (Fig.3B). Together, these findings support the notion that oxidative signaling contributes to the inhibition of LPS responses by phenolic antioxidants. To analyze the mechanism of the inhibition, we measured the mRNA expression of TNF-α. The macrophage cells express a barely detectable level of TNF-α mRNA in the absence of LPS stimulation (Fig. 4, A and B,lane 1). LPS induces a ∼50-fold increase in the expression of TNF-α mRNA (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 2). hq (100 μm) alone does not affect TNF-α mRNA expression (Fig. 4, A and B,lane 3), but it blocks LPS-induced expression of TNF-α mRNA dose-dependently, with an IC50 of ∼15–20 μm (Fig. 4, A and B,lanes 4–7), which is similar to the IC50measured by ELISA (Fig. 1C). On the contrary, resorcinol, given either alone or with LPS (Fig. 4, A and B,lanes 8 and 9), does not affect the expression of TNF-α mRNA. Thus, inhibition of TNF-α mRNA expression by phenolic antioxidants correlates with the inhibition of TNF-α protein production. To exclude the possibility that HQ inhibits gene transcription in general, we tested whether HQ induces HO-1, a known inducible gene by phenolic antioxidants (36Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar), under the same condition used for TNF-α analysis. HO-1 is expressed at a low level in macrophage cells (Fig. 4, A and C, lane 1). HQ induces HO-1 to a level ∼6-fold higher than control at 1 μm (Fig. 4, A and C, lane 4) and to a level >10-fold higher than control at 25, 50, and 100 μm (Fig. 4, A and C, lanes 3 and 5–7). LPS does not induce HO-1 or affect HO-1 induction by HQ. Resorcinol induces HO-1 to a minor extent (Fig. 4,A and C, lanes 8 and 9). Thus, HQ maintains its capacity to induce HO-1 under the same condition it inhibits TNF-α induction by LPS. Inhibition of LPS-induced increase in TNF-α mRNA can be due to a decrease in the synthesis of TNF-α mRNA, an increase in the degradation of TNF-α mRNA, or both. In Fig.5, we measured the half-life (t1/2) of LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA in the absence or presence of HQ. The data indicate that HQ does not affect the stability of LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA in either the absence or presence of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA synthesis (Fig.5A). The t1/2 of LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA is ∼1.2 h, whereas the t1/2 in the presence of HQ is ∼1.4 h (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that HQ inhibits LPS-induced expression of TNF-α through inhibition of the transcription of the gene. Previous studies have established that NF-κB is the major transcription factor that mediates the induction of TNF-α by LPS in macrophage cells (37Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 16: 225-260Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether phenolic antioxidants inhibit the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB by using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, which measures the formation of nuclear NF-κB dimers that bind to the NF-κB DNA response element, as a mechanism of inhibition of TNF-α transcription. As shown in Fig.6, LPS induces the formation of two NF-κB·DNA complexes (compare lanes 1 and 2). The LPS-induced NF-κB bands are specific for NF-κB binding element because unlabeled NF-κB DNA probe can compete off the binding of NF-κB to labeled NF-κB DNA probe (compare lanes 7 and8), whereas the AP-1 DNA probe, which is the DNA binding element for AP-1 proteins, fails to compete with the labeled NF-κB probe for binding (lane 9). The two NF-κB/DNA bands represent the p65/p50 heterodimer and the p50 homodimer of NF-κB, respectively, because antibodies against p50 supershift both bands (lane 10), whereas antibodies against p65 disrupt the upper band (p65/p50; lane 11), but not the p50 homodimer band. However, antibodies against c-Jun, NF-AT, or c-Fos have no effect on NF-κB band formation (lanes 12–14). Treatment with HQ alone does not induce NF-κB activation (lane 3), but it completely blocks LPS-induced formation of NF-κB dimer·DNA compl"

Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). For example, these complex processes entail extensive re-modeling of the extracellular matrix as well as the activation of latent growth factors and pro-angiogenic proteins. Consequently, the high level expression of particular proteinases often correlates with poor patient survival for several different cancers (see, for instance, Ref. 2Kute T.E. Grondahlhansen J. Shao S.M. Long R. Russell G. Brunner N. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 47: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Among these cancer-associated enzymes are serine proteinases such as urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA),1 elastase, plasmin, and cathepsin G; matrix metalloproteinases including gelatinases, interstitial collagenases, stromelysins, matrilysin, and membrane-type metalloproteinases; and lysosomal cysteine proteinases such as cathepsin B. Recently, several members of an important, emerging subfamily of serine proteinases, the type II transmembrane serine proteinases (TTSPs; reviewed in Ref. 3Hooper J.D. Clements J.A. Quigley J.P. Antalis T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 857-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), have also been implicated in tumor growth and progression. MT-SP1 (matriptase/TADG-15/suppressor of tumorigenicity 14; EC 3.4.21) was first isolated by Shi et al. (4Shi Y.E. Torri J. Yieh L. Wellstein A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1409-1415PubMed Google Scholar) as a novel proteinase that was expressed by human breast cancer cells. The enzyme was initially assigned as a gelatinase, because of its gelatinolytic properties and gelatinase-like molecular weight. However, isolation and sequencing of the cDNA revealed a 683-residue multidomain proteinase with a C-terminal serine proteinase domain. The enzyme was then named matriptase to emphasize its matrix degrading properties and trypsin-like specificity (5Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Independently, Takeuchi and co-workers (6Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) cloned and characterized a type-II membrane-bound trypsin-like serine proteinase from a human prostatic cancer cell line, which they called membrane-type serine proteinase 1, MT-SP1. This 855-residue proteinase contained two tandem repeats of the complement component C1r/s domain (CUB, derived from complement factor/1R-urchin embryonic growth factor/bone morphogenetic protein) and four tandem repeats of the lowdensity lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) class A domain between the N-terminal transmembrane signal anchor and the C-terminal catalytic domain (5Lin C.Y.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Because the matriptase sequence reported by Lin turned out to be part of the translated MT-SP1 cDNA sequence, matriptase is likely to be a form of MT-SP1 produced by ectodomain shedding (7Benaud C. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the two cDNAs may result from alternative splicing. MT-SP1 is highly expressed in prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers in vitro and in vivo (8Oberst M. Anders J. Xie B. Singh B. Ossandon M. Johnson M. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 1301-1311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and inhibition of this enzyme suppresses both primary tumor growth and metastasis in a rat model of prostate cancer (5Lin C.Y.

Kozak C. Schwartz R.H. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of MT-SP1 has been mapped using a positional scanning synthetic combinatorial library and substrate phage display (10Takeuchi T. Harris J.L. Huang W. Yan K.W. Coughlin S.R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26333-26342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The preferred cleavage sequences contained Arg/Lys at P4 and basic residues or Gln at P3, small residues at P2, Arg or Lys at P1, and Ala at P1′. This specificity profile corresponds well to the cleavage sequences of recognized surface localized protein substrates of MT-SP1 such as the proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), single-chain uPA (sc-uPA), the proform of MT-SP1, and the hepatocyte growth (scattering) factor, which have been shown in vitro and/or in vivo to be efficiently activated by MT-SP1 (10Takeuchi T.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36720-36725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Although human breast cancer cells produce MT-SP1 primarily as the free enzyme, in human milk and normal tissues the enzyme is found in complex with an inhibitor called hepatocyte growth factoractivator inhibitor 1 (HAI-1; Ref.12Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). This membrane-bound inhibitor was originally isolated from human stomach carcinoma cells (13Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T. Kito M. Kondo J. Kagaya S. Qin L. Takata H. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6370-6376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) as a 478 residue glycoprotein containing two Kunitz-type domains separated by an LDLR domain and followed by a transmembrane segment, but has been subsequently detected in several tissues. Soluble, presumably proteolytically cleaved forms of HAI-1, lacking the C-terminal hydrophobic domain, have also been reported (14Shimomura T. Denda K. Kawaguchi T. Matsumoto K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition to HAI-1, a smaller inhibitor (HAI-2) has been identified and characterized, which lacks the LDLR domain separating the two Kunitz-type modules in HAI-1. Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggested that the first Kunitz domain of HAI-2 is responsible for the inhibitory activity toward hepatocyte growth factor activator (15Qin L. Denda K. Shimomura T. Kawaguchi T. Kitamura N. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have expressed and purified the catalytic domain of human MT-SP1 (MT-SP1(cd)), and we have crystallized and solved the high resolution x-ray crystal structure of this enzyme in the presence of benzamidine (Bz). Because recombinant HAI-1 was not available, we also determined the structure of the MT-SP1 complex with the Kunitz-type bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), which shares a 36% sequence identity with the first Kunitz domain of HAI-1 and is a nanomolar range inhibitor of MT-SP1. These crystal structures provide important new insights into the molecular determinants of the unique specificity of MT-SP1 not obtainable from modeling (16Enyedy I.J. Lee S.L. Kuo A.H. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Wang S. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and give hints about the interaction of this proteinase with the physiological inhibitor HAI-1. This information is expected to facilitate the design of potent, selective small molecule inhibitors of MT-SP1 that may yield lead compounds for the development of novel anti-cancer agents. Because of the high accessibility of the substrate binding site, the MT-SP1(cd) crystals are well suited for soaking of small molecule inhibitors facilitating the further elaboration of initial lead compounds. The human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line, PC-3, was purchased from ATCC (CRL-1435). PC-3 cells were lysed in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. Poly(A)+ RNAs were purified using oligo(dT) beads (Oligotex; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and subsequently converted to single-stranded cDNAs by reverse transcription using ProSTAR first-strand reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Single-stranded cDNAs from PC-3 cell RNA were subjected to PCR with sense and antisense degenerate oligonucleotide primers (sense primer, 5′-TGGRT(I)VT(I)WS(I)GC(I)RC(I)CAYTG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-(I)GG(I)CC(I)CC(I)SWRTC(I)CCYT(I)RCA(I)GHRTC-3′, where R = A or G; V = G, A, or C; W = A or T; S = G or C; Y = C or T; and H = A, T, or C). The primer sequences corresponded to two highly conserved regions in all chymotrypsin-like serine proteinases. PCR products were purified using a gel extraction kit (QIAquick gel extraction kit; Qiagen), ligated into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), and transformed into Escherichia coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). To obtain additional MT-SP1 cDNA sequences, both rapid amplification of cDNA ends and gene-specific amplification reactions were performed. A human prostate Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to isolate part of the cDNA encoding MT-SP1. The 3′ region of MT-SP1 cDNA was successfully obtained by a 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends reaction using a gene-specific primer, 5′-CACCCCTTCTTCAATGACTTCACCTTCG-3′. The 5′ end of the MT-SP1 proteinase domain was obtained by a PCR amplification reaction using two MT-SP1-specific primers, 5′-TACCTCTCCTACGACTCC-3′ for the sense primer and 5′-GAGGTTCTCGCAGGTGGTCTGGTTG-3′ for the antisense primer. These fragments were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO. After transformation intoE. coli cells, the insert DNAs were characterized by Southern blot analysis (using the internal cDNA fragment as probe) and by DNA sequence analysis. To obtain a cDNA encoding the entire proteinase domain of MT-SP1, an end-to-end PCR amplification using the gene-specific primers 5′-TCTCTCGAGAAAAGAGTTGTTGGGGGCACGGATGCGGATGAG-3′ for the 5′ end and 5′-ATTCGCGGCCGCCTATACCCCAGTGTTCTCTTTGATCCA-3′ for the 3′ end. An 800-bp DNA fragment was amplified, purified, digested with XhoI and NotI, and subcloned into the Pichia pastoris expression vector, pPIC9KX. Transformation was performed in a Bio-Rad GenePulser II (voltage = 1500 V, capacity = 50 microfarads, and resistance = 200 ohms). The screening of transformed Pichia clones for MT-SP1 expression was performed by testing clones with Spectrozyme t-PA (CH3SO4-d-HHT-Gly-Arg-pNA.HCl; American Diagnostica). The production of multimilligram amounts of MT-SP1 was carried out by fermentation in a BioFlo 3000 fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific, NJ) using a SMD1168/pPIC9K:MT-SP1 Sac SC1 clone. The medium was inoculated with an overnight culture of the P. pastoris transformant. Cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged into 50 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 80, pH 8.0 (buffer A). The concentrated MT-SP1-containing solution was applied onto a 150-ml benzamidine column equilibrated with buffer A, and the column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1.0 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 80, pH 8.0 (buffer B), and eluted with 50 mmTris-HCl, 1.0 m l-arginine, 0.05% Tween 80, pH 8.0 (buffer C). Fractions containing MT-SP1 activity were pooled and concentrated. The buffer was exchanged into 50 mmNa2HPO4, 125 mm NaCl, pH 5.5 (buffer D), and the partially purified MT-SP1 was passed through a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) pre-equilibrated with buffer D. The flow-through was collected, and the protein concentration was determined by measurement ofA280 (using an extinction coefficient of 2.012 mg/A280). Purified MT-SP1 was deglycosylated with endoglycosidase H (ProZyme, 5 units/ml) and further purified on aÄkta Explorer system using a 7-ml Source 15Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The protein was eluted in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.5, with a 0–0.33m NaCl gradient. Fractions containing protein were pooled, and benzamidine was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The protein purity was examined by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was determined by measurement ofA280. Plate-like crystals of the Bz-MT-SP1 complex were grown from 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mammonium sulfate, 3% ethanol at 18 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. These crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group C222, diffract x-rays to beyond 1.3-Å resolution, and have one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The Bz-MT-SP1 crystals were transferred to 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5m ammonium sulfate, 23% glycerol. A complete native data set to 1.3-Å resolution was collected from a single crystal under a nitrogen stream at 100 K using synchrotron radiation and a CCD system (MAR Research, Hamburg, Germany) at DESY, Hamburg, Germany. These data were evaluated with the MOSFLM package (43Leslie A. Moras D. Podjarny A.D. Thierry J.C. Crystal Computing V. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 27-38Google Scholar) and loaded and scaled using SCALA from the CCP4 program suite (17Collaborative Computational Project No. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). For the determination of the orientation and position of the MT-SP1 molecules in the crystals, rotational and translational searches were performed with AMoRe (18Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) using data from 20- to 3.5-Å resolution and a modified enteropeptidase search model (19Lu D. Futterer K. Korolev S. Zheng X. Tan K. Waksman G. Sadler J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) with all nonidentical residues reduced to Ala. A unique solution was found with a correlation factor of 39.4% and an R-factor of 46.2%; the corresponding values of the next best solution were 12.8 and 56.3%, respectively. Crystallographic refinement was done in several cycles consisting of model building performed with MAIN (20Turk D.

A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2533) Google Scholar) were used. This procedure converged rapidly, yielding a model with excellent parameters (see TableI). In the final model building/refinement cycles, water molecules were inserted at stereochemically reasonable sites, and individual restrained atomicB-values were refined. 5.1% of all reflections were omitted from the refinement to calculate the Rfree; the final R and Rfree are 18.4 and 19.3%, respectively, for all data to 1.3 Å. The whole main chain of the MT-SP1 catalytic domain is in appropriate electron density. Only a few side chains projecting out into solution are partially undefined in the electron density; the occupancy of all undefined atoms was set to zero. Modeling was performed interactively using MAIN; these models were energy refined with CNS.Table ICrystallographic dataInhibitorBzBPTIData collection Space groupC222P1 Molecules in asymmetric unit12 Cell constantsa66.92 Å47.10 Åb141.60 Å54.23 Åc51.94 Å67.82 Åα90.00°107.62°β90.00°96.86°γ90.00°103.36° Limiting resolution1.30 Å2.93 Å Rmerge, overall8.6%12.0% Rmerge, outermost shell29.4%34.3% Unique reflections58,80512,200 Completeness, overall96.2%94.4% Completeness, outermost shell93.5%93.1% Non-hydrogen protein atoms18644618 Heterogen atoms140 Solvent atoms38180Refinement statistics Test set size5.1%8.1% Resolution range18.0–1.30 Å12.0–2.93 Å Completeness, overall96.2%94.4% Completeness, outermost shell91.7%93.1% R18.4%19.9% R, outermost shell23.7%30.0% Rfree19.3%27.9% Rfree, outermost shell25.0%40.8% Root mean square standard deviationsBond length0.010 Å0.007 ÅBond angles1.6°1.4° AverageB-value/S.D.13.7 Å214.4 Å2 Ramachandran plotMost favored region89.3%74.3%Favored region10.7%23.5%Generously allowed region2.3% Open table in a new tab Crystals of the complex were grown from 0.1 m Hepes, pH 6.5, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000, 2% CsCl2 at 18 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. These crystals belong to the triclinic space group P1, diffract x-rays to beyond 2.9-Å resolution, and have two molecules in the asymmetric unit. After transfer of one crystal to its mother solution containing 20% glycerol, a complete native data set to 2.93-Å resolution was collected from a single crystal under a nitrogen stream at 100 K using an Image Plate system (MAR Research). The data were processed as described above, with a combined model of the BPTI-trypsin complex (23Huber R. Kukla D. Bode W. Schwager P. Bartels K. Deisenhofer J. Steigemann W. J. Mol.

The procedure converged rapidly, leading to R and Rfree of 19.9 and 26.9%, respectively. 8.1% of the reflections were omitted from the refinement for the calculation of theRfree. Our cloning, expression, and purification procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” yielded multimilligram quantities of highly purified MT-SP1(cd), which in the presence of Bz formed crystals diffracting to beyond 1.3-Å resolution. MT-SP1(cd) resembles an oblate ellipsoid with diameters of 35 and 50 Å. Similar to other trypsin-like serine proteinases, the chain is folded into two adjacent six-stranded β-barrels strapped together by three trans-domain segments. The surface contains several turn structures, a 310-helix (residues 60(I) to 64, using the chymotrypsinogen numbering, see Figs.1A and 2), and two α-helices (segments 164–172 and 235–243). The catalytic triad is located along the junction of the barrels, whereas the active site cleft runs perpendicular to this junction.Figure 2Structure-based amino acid sequence alignment of the human MT-SP1 catalytic domain with human enteropeptidase (40Kitamoto Y.

A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Cys122, which would be disulfide-linked with Cys1 of the A-chain in the full-length MT-SP1 molecule, is an unpaired surface located cysteine residue in this construct. The MT-SP1 B-chain contains three disulfide bridges (Cys42-Cys58, Cys168-Cys182, and Cys191-Cys220) that are also present in most other trypsin-like serine proteinases. However, based on the electron density of the 1.3-Å Bz-MT-SP1(cd) structure, the disulfide bridge Cys42-Cys58 is present in only about half of the crystallized protein molecules. In the other half, these cysteines clearly exist in the reduced form, with Cys58 Sγ located in the same position as in the Cys42-Cys58disulfide, and Cys42 Sγ rotated toward the interior of the molecule between Tyr59 Oγ and the Leu33side chain, thereby avoiding steric hindrance with the adjacent Cys58 thiol group. A similar partial opening of the Cys42-Cys58 disulfide bridge has recently been found in a high resolution structure of the recombinant human uPA catalytic domain (24Nienaber V. Wang J.Y. Davidson D. Henkin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7239-7248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The α-ammonium group of the N-terminal Val16 of MT-SP1 forms the highly conserved internal salt bridge with the side chain carboxylate of Asp194, stabilizing the substrate binding site and the active site in the catalytically active conformation. In contrast to most (chymo)trypsin-like proteinases, the whole C-terminal region of MT-SP1, including the last residue, Val244, is fully defined by electron density. After the conserved C-terminal α-helix, the MT-SP1 polypeptide makes a sharp turn at Gly243 and forms an as yet unobserved surface-located salt bridge with the Arg235 guanidyl group via its C-terminal carboxylate group. An optimal superposition with several related serine proteinases reveals highest topological similarity of MT-SP1(cd) with the catalytic domain of another membrane-type serine proteinase, enteropeptidase/enterokinase (Fig. 1B). 222 Cαatoms of topologically equivalent residues are found within a 2.0-Å distance, corresponding to an root mean square deviation of 0.70 Å, with 109 of these topologically equivalent residues being identical. The next best fit, with a 0.73-Å root mean square deviation for 212 Cα atoms, is observed with bovine trypsin (25Bode W. Schwager P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 693-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), followed by bovine chymotrypsin (26Birktoft J.J. Blow D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 68: 187-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and human thrombin (27Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The topological equivalence with chymotrypsin(ogen) formed the basis for the sequence alignment and the chymotrypsinogen numbering of the MT-SP1 catalytic domain used in this paper (Fig. 2). This alignment requires a nine-residue insertion between residues Ile60 and Pro61, single-residue insertions behind residues Gly184, Glu186, Ala204, and Ala221, and single-residue deletions at positions 149 and 218. Inserted residues are marked by suffixes following the residue number of the preceding common residue. The narrow substrate specificity of MT-SP1 arises from unique structural determinants of its active site cleft that is shaped in part by the surrounding surface loops. In the following brief description, these loops (defined according to the residue number of their central residue) will be addressed in an anticlockwise manner with respect to the standard orientation displayed in Fig. 1A. To the east of the catalytic triad, the rigid 37 loop projects out of the molecular surface of MT-SP1. This loop contains two of the “zymogen triad” residues, Ser32 and His40, which, together with Asp194, would stabilize the inactive zymogen-like conformation of the proenzyme (28Bode W. Schwager P. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 118: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 29Madison E.L. Kobe A. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Goldsmith E.J. Science. 1993; 262: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Around Gln38, this loop deviates markedly from the path followed in most other chymotrypsin-like proteinases (Fig. 1B). This conformation seems to be mainly stabilized by the Gln38side chain, which is held in an exposed position via hydrogen bonds made through its terminal carboxamide group with Tyr60(G) Oγ and with the π-electron system of the Phe60(E) phenyl ring. The most striking feature of MT-SP1 is the unusually large 60 insertion loop, which is of the same length (nine additional residues) and exhibits a similar β-hairpin conformation as the corresponding loop in thrombin (27Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), but is oriented differently (Fig. 1B). The eight residues of MT-SP1 between Tyr59 and Ser60(H) form a protruding irregular β-hairpin loop, which is stabilized through internal main chain-side chain hydrogen bonds made by the Asp60(A) and Asp60(B) carboxylate groups. In thrombin, the rigid 60 loop partially occludes the active site and hence contributes to the narrow substrate specificity (27Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In MT-SP1, the loop is rotated away from the active site creating a more open cavity than in thrombin. Unlike the basic side chains of Lys60(F) in thrombin or Arg60(G) in enteropeptidase (19Lu D. Futterer K. Korolev S. Zheng X. Tan K. Waksman G. Sadler J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the Arg60(F) side chain of MT-SP1 is directed away from the active site cleft and located between the side chains of Asp60(A) and Asp60(I). To the north of the active site, the 99 loop of MT-SP1 protrudes from the molecular surface and forms a “roof” on top of the active site cleft. Noteworthy is the clustering of aromatic side chains around this loop. The benzyl side chain of Phe99, which protects the hydrogen bonding interaction between the catalytic residues Asp102 and His57 from the solvent, delimits the S2 subsite. Unique to MT-SP1 is the well defined benzyl side chain of Phe97, which extends away from the apex of the 99 loop partially shielding the circularly arranged carbonyl groups of Asp96, Phe97, and Thr98 (see Fig.3). The “autolysis” or 145 loop of MT-SP1 is one residue shorter and less exposed than the corresponding segment of chymotrypsin. This loop encircles the extended side chain of His143 and forms the southern boundary or “floor” of the active site cleft (Fig.4"

The primary objective of the present study was to define the substrate recognition profile of MMP-2, a protease that was historically referred to as gelatinase A. By cleaving a phage peptide library with recombinant MMP-2, four distinct sets of substrates were identified. The first set is structurally related to substrates previously reported for other MMPs. These substrates contain the PXX↓XHy consensus motif (where XHy is a hydrophobic residue) and are not generally selective for MMP-2 over the other MMPs tested. Two other groups of substrates were selected from the phage library with similar frequency. Substrates in group II contain the L/IXX↓XHy consensus motif. Substrates in group III contain a consensus motif with a sequence ofXHySX↓L, and the fourth set of substrates contain the HXX↓XHysequence. Substrates in Group II, III, and IV were found to be 8- to almost 200-fold more selective for MMP-2 over MMP-9. To gain an understanding of the structural basis for substrate selectivity, individual residues within substrates were mutated, revealing that the P2 residue is a key element in conferring selectivity. These findings indicate that MMP-2 and MMP-9 exhibit different substrate recognition profiles and point to the P2 subsite as a primary determinant in substrate distinction.

Mecham P.R. Matrix Metalloproteinases: Biology of Extracellular Matrix Series. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). The MMPs are also of interest as pharmaceutical targets because of their association with a number of pathological conditions (2Greenwald R.A. Zucker S. Golub L.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.878. NY Academy of Sciences, New York1999Google Scholar). One key area of interest is tumor angiogenesis, where MMP-2 and MMP-9 appear to have important roles. Mice lacking the gene for MMP-2 exhibit reduced tumor angiogenesis (3Itoh T. Tanioka M. Yoshida H. Yoshioka T. Nishimoto H. Itohara S. Can. Res. 1998; 58: 1048-1051PubMed Google Scholar), an effect that may be related to the connection between MMP-2 and the αvβ3 integrin in angiogenesis (4Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). The role of MMP-9 in angiogenesis also appears to be significant, as this protease is reported to be part of the “angiogenic switch” that enacts the vascularization of tumors (5Bergers G. Brekken R. Mcmahon G. Vu T.H. Itoh T. Tamaki K. Tanzawa K. Thorpe P. Itohara S. Werb Z. Hanahan D. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). Despite the structural similarity among these proteases, there are strong indications that their mechanisms of action are distinct in tumor angiogenesis. There are circumstances where both proteases are present within tumors, but only one participates in the angiogenic switch (5Bergers G. Brekken R. Mcmahon G. Vu T.H. Itoh T. Tamaki K. Tanzawa K. Thorpe P. Itohara S. Werb Z. Hanahan D. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). Similar distinctions in the role of these MMPs have also been observed in platelet function (6Fernandez-Patron C. Martinez-Cuesta M.A. Salas E. Sawicki G. Wozniak M. Radomski M.W. Davidge S.T. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1730-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and in cell migration (7Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). At present there is no mechanistic explanation for these distinctions, but they raise the possibility that the two MMPs operate by cleaving distinct substrates. The factors that govern substrate recognition and substrate distinction by the MMPs have not been fully elucidated. The structural features of the catalytic clefts of all MMPs are generally similar. All of the catalytic clefts contain a zinc ion and glutamic acid residue involved in catalysis (8Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 197-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2639) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the MMPs contain a deep S1′ pocket (9Grams F. Reinemer P. Powers J.C. Kleine T. Pieper M. Tschesche H.

Science. 1994; 263: 375-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This subsite has been exploited as a docking point for the vast majority of pharmaceutical inhibitors of the MMPs. Perhaps not surprisingly then, many of these antagonists are broad spectrum inhibitors (15Brown P.D. Giavazzi R. Ann. Oncol. 1995; 6: 967-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and show evidence of unwanted side effects (16Parsons S.L. Watson S.A. Steele R.J. E. J. Surg. Oncol. 1997; 23: 526-531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Nemunaitis J. Poole C. Primrose J. Rosemurgy A. Malfetano J. Brown P. Berrington A. Cornish A. Lynch K. Rasmussen H. Kerr D. Cox D. Millar A. Clin. Can. Res. 1998; 4: 1101-1109PubMed Google Scholar). There is also evidence to indicate that the common structural features of the catalytic cleft lead to an overlap in substrate recognition (18Netzel-Arnett S. Sang Q.X. Moore W.G. Navre M. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6427-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The vast majority of known MMP substrates contain a large hydrophobic residue, which is frequently leucine, at the P1′ position. This is consistent with the deep S1′ pocket. Further similarity is observed at the P3 position, where proline is often preferred. In fact, the PXX↓XHy motif appears to be an excellent substrate for a wide range of MMPs (19Smith M.M. Shi L. Navre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6440-6449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Deng S.J. Bickett D.M. Mitchell J.L. Lambert M.H. Blackburn R.K. Carter H.L.

Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, recent work counters the notion that MMPs have an overlapping substrate recognition profile. Recent studies on both MMP-13 and MMP-9 show that a high degree of selectivity can be obtained for individual MMPs, even among substrates comprised of the PXX↓XHy motif (20Deng S.J. Bickett D.M. Mitchell J.L. Lambert M.H. Blackburn R.K. Carter H.L. Neugebauer J. Pahel G. Weiner M.P. Moss M.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Given these recent observations, we wondered whether very closely related MMPs would exhibit distinctions in substrate recognition. Thus, we focus on substrate recognition by MMP-2 and its closely related homolog, MMP-9. These two MMPs are unique in that they contain three type II fibronectin domains intercalated within their catalytic domains. Although these fibronectin domains are oriented away from the catalytic cleft, they are believed to mediate docking interactions with substrates like gelatin and with the natural inhibitors, TIMPs. Until now it was assumed that MMP-2 and MMP-9 have overlapping substrate recognition profiles. Here we use an unbiased substrate phage approach to obtain the substrate recognition profile of MMP-2. We find that like other MMPs, MMP-2 can cleave peptides containing the PXXXHy sequence. However, three novel substrate motifs were also identified. These novel substrates are highly selective for MMP-2 over MMP-9. Consequently, the results of the present study challenge the idea that the two enzymes are functionally similar and provide a potential basis for their distinct biological roles. MMP-7 (active enzyme), MMP-13 (pro-enzyme), and TIMP-2 were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Ilomastat was purchased from AMS Scientific (Concord, CA). Restriction enzymes were from Roche Biosciences or New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Tissue culture media and reagents were from Irvine Scientific (Irvine, CA). All other reagents, chemicals, and plastic ware were from Sigma or Fisher. The substrate phage library used in this study was generated using a modified version of the fUSE5 phagemid (22Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar), as we have previously described (21Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The library's primary features are a random peptide hexamer on the N terminus of the gene III protein and a FLAG epitope positioned to the N terminus of the hexamer. The substrate phage library represents 2.4 × 108 individual sequences, ensuring with 75% confidence that all possible sequences are represented (22Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). Recombinant MMP-2 was generated in a manner similar to that we have previously reported for MMP-9 (21Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA encoding the catalytic domain of MMP-2 was generated by PCR, cloned into the pCDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen), and used to transfect HEK 293 cells. Individual antibiotic-resistant clones were isolated with cloning rings, expanded, and then screened by reverse transcription-PCR and zymography. The catalytic domains of MMP-2 and 9 were purified from the conditioned medium by gelatin-Sepharose chromatography as described previously (23O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Knauper V. Cowell S. Smith B. Lopez-Otin C. O'Shea M. Morris H. Zardi L. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7608-7616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). We also employed an additional purification by ion exchange on Q-Sepharose to obtain greater purity. Fractions containing MMP-2 or 9 were concentrated in a dialysis bag against Aquacide II (Calbiochem). The purity of both enzymes was greater than 90% judging by silver-stained acrylamide gels. The purified zymogens of MMP-2 and 9 were stored at −70 °C at concentrations ranging from 0.4–1.3 mg/ml. MMPs were activated by 2 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate(APMA) at room temperature as previously described (23O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). APMA was used to activate the two MMPs to avoid the inclusion of additional contaminating proteases in our phage selections. After activation, the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were titrated using the hydroxamate inhibitor ilomastat as previously described (21Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Galardy R.E. Cassabonne M.E. Giese C. Gilbert J.H. Lapierre F. Lopez H. Schaefer M.E. Stack R. Sullivan M. Summers B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The active sites of full-length MMP-13 and MMP-7 were titrated with human TIMP-2. Briefly, 5–15 nm of each protease was pre-incubated with a range of TIMP-2 for 5 h at room temperature. Residual MMP-13 activity was monitored by cleavage of MCA-Pro-Cha-Gly-Nva-His-Ala-Dpa-NH2 (Calbiochem). Residual MMP-7 activity was monitored by cleavage of MCA-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (Calbiochem). The substrate phage library (2 × 1010 phage) was incubated with 2.5 μg/ml of MMP-2 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, and 0.05% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. A control reaction was performed without protease. The cleaved phage were separated from the non-cleaved phage by immuno-depletion. 100 μg of an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was added to the phage samples and then incubated for 18 h with rocking at 4 °C. The phage-antibody complexes were twice precipitated by the addition of 100 μl of pansorbin (Calbiochem). The cleaved phage remaining in the supernatant were amplified using K91 Escherichia coli and were then used for one additional round of substrate selection. Hydrolysis of individual phage substrates was measured using a modified ELISA that we have previously described (21Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, phage from overnight cultures were captured into microtiter plates coated with anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., 2.5 μg/ml). The captured phage were incubated with MMP-2 (2.5 μg/ml) in incubation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 0.05% BSA, 0.05% Brij-35, 50 μmZnCl2) for 2 h at 37 °C. Control wells lacked protease. Following hydrolysis and extensive washing, anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (1.8 μg/ml in TBS-T with 1 mg/ml BSA) was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h. Following additional washing, the level of bound anti-FLAG antibody was quantified with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Bio-Rad) followed by detection at 490 nm. The extent of hydrolysis of each phage was calculated by the ratio of theA490 of the protease-treated samplesversus samples lacking protease. Peptides representing the phage inserts were synthesized to our specifications by Annaspec Inc. The N termini were acetylated and C termini were synthesized as amides. The cleavage site within peptide substrates was determined using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. MMP-2 (25 nm) was incubated with 200 μm of each peptide independently in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C. The mass of the cleavage products was determined using a Voyager DE-RP MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Following hydrolysis, the peptide samples were prepared for MALDI analysis according to methods described previously (26Landry F. Lombardo C.R. Smith J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and subsites within the peptide were designated according to the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (27Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4766) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters of substrate hydrolysis were measured using a fluorescamine incorporation assay that has been previously described (28Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R.

Briefly, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-7, or MMP-13 were incubated with individual peptide substrates at concentrations ranging from 100–800 μm in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and 50 μm ZnCl2. At selected time points the reactions were stopped by the addition of 1,10-phenanthroline. Peptide hydrolysis was determined by the addition of fluorescamine followed by detection at λex 355 nm and λem 460 nm. The data were transformed to double reciprocal plots (1/[S]versus 1/Vi) to determineKm and kcat (28Ding L. Coombs G.S. Strandberg L. Navre M. Corey D.R. Madison E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For some substrates, Km andkcat could not be determined individually, but the specificity constant,kcat/Km, was derived by the equation: kcat/Km = vi/(E0)(S0) and with the assumption that (S) is significantly lower than the Km(18Netzel-Arnett S.

Recombinant fusion proteins between EphB1, EphB2, and the Fc domain of IgG were purchased from R&D Systems Inc. In these constructs, the extracellular domain of rat EphB1 (amino acid residues 1–538) and mouse EphB2 (amino acid residues 1–548) are fused to the Fc region of human IgG via a short polypeptide linker (32Lhotak V. Greer P. Letwin K. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2496-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins (1.8 μm) were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with 280 nm of either MMP-2 or MMP-9. Following incubation, samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and samples were visualized by Coomassie staining. The N terminus of the cleaved Eph B1 was determined by automated Edman degradation of protein blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Activated MMP-2 was used to select optimal substrates from a phage display library that we have previously described (21Kridel S.J. Chen E. Kotra L.P. Howard E.W. Mobashery S. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20572-20578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Following two rounds of phage hydrolysis and subsequent amplification, several individual phage clones were selected randomly and assessed for hydrolysis by MMP-2. The phage vector encodes a FLAG epitope that is positioned to the N-terminal side of the randomized peptide hexamer. Therefore, cleavage within the hexamer by MMP-2 was gauged by measuring the liberation of the FLAG epitope using an ELISA. Thirty individual clones were selected for sequencing based on the fact that they were cleaved by more than 25% when incubated for 2 h with activated MMP-2 (60 nm). Four distinct groups of substrates are found among these clones (Table I).Table ISequences of phage substrates for MMP-2GroupPeptide sequenceClone% HydrolysisP3P2P1P1′P2′P3′exp1exp2ISGPYVIWLA45100100RPPMAKTAA50100100SGPVWYMSA2610098SGPVRYMVA3510090GLPRWLLTA479190GRPIRMKTA465149IILRLAAITAB49100100IYLGWATAA29100100PMISVLTAA549896ESLAYYTAB748190GSLHSIITB547275SDIRMLTAB796470FNLYNLTAB665150GYLQVLLTB464850SGIVNLYPA433840EYLHMRTAA103640VGLIAITAA63044IIIRSLSRLTAC9100100NRYSSLTAA34100100WTSSWLTAA31100100GAVSWLLTA1310093ANISDLTAB379795TILSLLTAB537375GFNSMLKTC32830IVGLHRRIDTC560NDGMHSRPPTA95063HMHKALTAA213049GRHLGLQTA43045GLHKKVHTC619NDGAHAKHWTD313NDPhage from the second round of selection were screened for hydrolysis by MMP-2 using an ELISA.

Phage are also ranked according to the extent of hydrolysis by MMP-2 at 2 h. ND, not determined. The first group of substrates contains the PXXXHy motif, where XHyrepresents a large hydrophobic residue. This motif appears to be a substrate for a number of different MMPs (19Smith M.M. Shi L.

Substrates in group II-IV represent novel recognition motifs for MMP-2. Group II substrates contain the I/LXXXHy motif, in which the last hydrophobic residue is usually Ile or Leu. Group III substrates contain the XHySXL motif, where Ser and Leu are invariant. Group IV substrates are comprised of the HXXXHy motif, which is similar to the cleavage site for MMP-2 within laminin-5 (7Giannelli G. Falk-Marzillier J. Schiraldi O. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quaranta V. Science. 1997; 277: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). We compared the rate of hydrolysis of a set of representative phage substrates by MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Fig. 1). With the exception of one clone, A45, the phage from group I lacked selectivity for MMP-2 over MMP-9. In contrast however, all of the phage substrates from groups II and III were highly selective for MMP-2 over MMP-9. The extent of hydrolysis of phage substrates from group IV was not compared using this assay because their rate of hydrolysis by MMP-2 was generally low. These substrates were characterized in more detail with the aid of synthetic peptides (see below). Representative peptides from groups I-IV were synthesized and used to characterize substrate hydrolysis in greater detail. The peptides were initially used to determine the position of the scissile bond within each motif by analyzing the cleavage products by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (TableII). In virtually all cases, the scissile bond directly precedes a large hydrophobic residue, which is frequently Ile or Leu (Table I). This feature is consistent with the presence of a deep binding pocket at the corresponding S1′ subsite within MMP-2 (13Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G.

The position of the scissile bond is noted by placing the P1 and P1′ residues in bold. The synthetic peptide substrates were also used to gain more detailed information on the selectivity of the substrate motifs for individual MMPs. We compared the rate of hydrolysis of each peptide by MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-7, and MMP-13. Each enzyme was quantified by active site titration to ensure that accurate comparisons were obtained. The initial velocity of hydrolysis was measured across a range of peptide concentrations, and reciprocal plots were used to deriveKm and kcat for MMP-2 and thekcat/Km ratio for each enzyme (Table III). A double reciprocal plot of the hydrolysis of peptide B74 is shown as a representative plot (Fig.2). When cleaved by MMP-2, most of the substrates exhibited Michaelis constants in the mm range, with turnover rates ranging from 1 to 750 s−1. Correspondingly, the kcat/Kmratios were all between 1.6 × 104m−1 s−1 and 2 × 105m−1 s−1. Most significantly, substrates from groups II, III, and IV exhibitkcat/Km ratios that are 8- to 350-fold higher for MMP-2 than for the other MMPs. As a group, the substrates within group II show the most selectivity. The selectivity of these substrates for MMP-2 is conveniently illustrated by the ratio of kcat/Km for MMP-2 divided by the same value for the other MMPs (TableIV).Table IIIMeasuring peptide hydrolysis by a panel of MMPsPeptideSequenceMMP-2MMP-9MMP-7MMP-13kcatKmkcat/Kmkcat/Kmkcat/Kmkcat/Kms−1mmm−1s−1m−1s−1m−1s−1m−1 s−1Group I A3SGAKPRA ↓ LTA4003.61.1E+054.9E+045.2E+037.9E+03Group II B49SGLRLAA ↓ ITA5104.51.1E+057.9E+031.9E+048.5E+03 B74SGESLAY ↓ YTA6222.22.8E+052.6E+037.9E+022.0E+03 B74PSGESPAY ↓ YTA2640.64.4E+053.0E+041.5E+035.3E+03 B74RSGESLRY ↓ YTA610.87.6E+041.0E+057.1E+021.1E+03 C9SGRSLSR ↓ LTA7404.41.7E+058.6E+024.8E+033.3E+03 C9RSGRSLRR ↓ LTA3026.44.7E+045.3E+042.2E+033.9E+03Group III A13SGAVSW ↓ LLTA1051.38.1E+045.4E+036.4E+032.9E+03 A13PSGAPSW ↓ LLTA2040.45.1E+051.7E+045.4E+034.9E+03 A13RSGAVRW ↓ LLTA280.47.0E+042.0E+053.5E+032.9E+03 B37SGANISD ↓ LTA3532.41.5E+052.1E+038.6E+032.6E+03 A34SGNRYSS ↓ LTA2022.29.2E+042.3E+031.1E+033.9E+03Group IV A21SGHMHKA ↓ LTA1247.71.6E+042.1E+03NDND A21ASGHMHAA ↓ LTA6013.21.9E+051.9E+03NDNDThe hydrolysis of synthetic peptides by different MMPs was quantified using procedures outlined in “Experimental Procedures.” For MMP-2, hydrolysis was measured over a concentration range of peptide.

Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis showed that the CD45R0 isoform, but not the CD45RBC or CD45RABC isoforms, was found as homodimers and also preferentially associated with CD4 and CD8 at the cell-surface. A comparison was therefore made of T cell antigen receptor signaling between sub-clones expressing either CD45R0 or CD45RBC. Under basal conditions CD4-associated p56lcktyrosine kinase activity and cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation levels were higher in the CD45R0+ than in the CD45RBC+ sub-clones. Upon CD3-CD4 ligation, TCR-ζ phosphorylation, ZAP-70 recruitment to the p21/p23 TCR-ζ phosphoisomers, ZAP-70 phosphorylation, as well as p56lck, c-Cbl and Slp-76 phosphorylation, were all markedly increased in CD45R0+ compared with CD45RBC+ cells. T cell antigen receptor (TCR) stimulation alone also promoted c-Cbl phosphorylation in CD45R0+ but not in CD45RBC+cells. Our results are consistent with a model in which association of CD45R0 with CD4 generates a more active pool of CD4-associated p56lck kinase molecules.

The dominant effect of CD45 in the T-lineage appears to be at pTyr-505, since T cell development in CD45−/− mice can be largely restored by back-crossing to mice expressing the mutant lckY505F-active transgene (17Pingel S.

Immunol. 1992; 148: 4054-4065PubMed Google Scholar). All T cells express more than one CD45 isoform, and differential isoform expression is tightly controlled during thymic development and the activation of mature T cells (reviewed in Ref.1). However, the molecular consequences of differential CD45 isoform expression for TCR signaling, if any, are not yet well understood. Reconstitution of a murine CD45− cell line with CD45 isoforms suggested that the CD45R0 isoform (lacking the A, B, and C exon-encoded segments of the ectodomain) promoted greater interleukin-2 secretion upon engagement of the TCR with the cognate major histocompatibility complex-peptide as compared with other isoforms (22Novak T.J. Farber D. Leitenberg D. Hong S.C. Johnson P. Bottomly K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Co-capping experiments in these cells revealed preferential CD4-CD45R0 association (23Leitenberg D. Novak T.J. Farber D. Smith B.R. Bottomly K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, more detailed capping and co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated a basal association of CD45R0 with the TCR independent of CD4 expression and suggested that co-capping of CD4 with CD45R0 was mediated by this prior CD45R0-TCR association (24Leitenberg D. Boutin Y. Lu D.D. Bottomly K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nevertheless CD4-CD45 association has also been described in primary CD4+ T cells (25Mittler R.S. Rankin B.M. Kiener P.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3434-3440PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bonnard M. Maroun C.R. Julius M. Cell. Immunol. 1997; 175: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells transfected with different isoforms, the CD45R0 isoform was found to promote greater interleukin-2 secretion in comparison with CD45RABC+ cells, but conversely TCR-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation was generally higher in CD45RABC+ than in CD45R0+ cells (27McKenney D.W.

It has been suggested that homodimerization of CD45 may lead to inhibition of its tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity (29Majeti R. Xu Z. Parslow T.G. Olson J.L. Daikh D.I. Killeen N. Weiss A.

Mutation of the putative inhibitory wedge domain in an epidermal growth factor-CD45 chimeric receptor to prevent epidermal growth factor-induced homodimerization relieved the inhibitory effects of epidermal growth factor on TCR-mediated signaling (30Majeti R. Bilwes A.M. Noel J.P. Hunter T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 279: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Introduction of the same point mutation in a mouse line resulted in autoimmunity, consistent with the prevention of inhibition of CD45 PTPase activity (29Majeti R. Xu Z. Parslow T.G. Olson J.L. Daikh D.I. Killeen N. Weiss A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1059-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that the CD45R0 isoform might homodimerize substantially, perhaps due to engagement by a putative exogenous ligand, so preferentially being subject to negative regulation by the inhibitory wedge (29Majeti R.

This model suggests that CD45R0 homodimers should exert a negative effect on TCR signaling. In the present work we have used the well characterized CD45− HPB-ALL T cell line (31Shiroo M. Goff L. Biffen M. Shivnan E. Alexander D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4887-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the absence of CD45, TCR signaling in this CD4+CD8+ line is largely ablated but can be restored by transfection of CD45 cDNA (31Shiroo M. Goff L. Biffen M. Shivnan E. Alexander D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4887-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). We have transfected this line with three different CD45 isoforms and used fluorescence energy resonance transfer (FRET), a technique that obviates the need for co-capping or detergent lysis, to show that CD45R0, but not the CD45RBC or CD45RABC isoforms, exists as homodimers and also associates preferentially with CD4 and CD8. Investigation of TCR signaling shows that the higher activity of CD4-associated p56lck in CD45R0+ cells correlates with elevated basal protein phosphorylation and with enhanced TCR signal transduction intensity.

Abraham, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN), phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), LAT and p56lck (from Dr L. Samelson, NIH, Bethesda, MD), SLP-76 (from Dr G. Koretzky, University of Pennsylvania Medical School), ZAP-70 (from Glaxo-Smith-Kline), and TCR-ζ chain (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from DAKO (Ely, UK). The vector expressing the Grb-2 GST-fusion protein was from Prof. D. Cantrell. Constructs containing cDNA encoding human CD45R0, CD45RBC, and CD45RABC isoforms in a retroviral vector pZipNeoSV(X) (33Streuli M. Morimoto C. Schrieber M. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 3910-3914PubMed Google Scholar) were from Prof. M. Streuli (Harvard University, Boston, MA). The CD45− HPB-ALL sub-clone has been previously described (31Shiroo M. Goff L. Biffen M. Shivnan E. Alexander D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4887-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with added penicillin, streptomycin, and 5% fetal calf serum. Stable transfectants of CD45 isoforms were sorted by flow cytometry to generate sub-clones with comparable CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD45 expression. Cells were routinely analyzed using CD45 isoform-specific mAbs to confirm the specificity of isoform expression. The CD45R0SDand CD45R0LG sub-clones were transfected with humanLck cDNA (from Dr. C. Butcher, The Yamanouchi Institute, Oxford, UK) sub-cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen, Leek, Netherlands). For stimulation experiments, HPB-ALL cells were resuspended in RPMI without fetal calf serum and allowed to rest for 20 min at 37 °C before adding biotin-CD3 and biotin-CD4 mAbs (at 1 μg/ml) or biotin-CD3 alone, for 2 min prior to addition of streptavidin (to 20 μg/ml) for the times shown. Northern blot analysis was carried out using 10 μg of total RNA from each HPB-ALL sub-clone, and blots were probed using a 32P-labeled 1.5-kbEcoRI-NotI DNA fragment from pCR2.1/hLck. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with a 32P-labeled gylceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) probe as a loading control. F(ab′) fragments were prepared by digestion of purified IgG with activated papain at 37 °C for 11 min. The enzyme activity was terminated by addition of iodoacetamide. The reaction mixture was passed through a Sephadex G-100 fine column and the collected F(ab′) fractions were further separated from intact IgG on a protein A-Sepharose column. Purified mAbs and F(ab′) fragments were conjugated with 6-(fluorescein-5-carboxamido)-hexanoic acid succinimidyl ester and 6-(tetramethylrhodamine-5-carboxamido)-hexanoic acid succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or with sulfoindo-cyanin succinimidyl bifunctional ester derivative of Cy-3 and Cy-5 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as described (34Hederer R.A. Guntermann C. Miller N. Nagy P. Szollosi J. Damjanovich S. Hale G. Alexander D.R. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The dye:protein ratios were separately determined for each labeled aliquot by spectrophotometric measurements and in the case of F(ab′) fragments were ∼1. The fluorescently tagged antibodies and F(ab′) fragments retained their binding capacity according to competition assays with identical but unlabeled antibodies. Shortly before use, conjugated F(ab′) fragments were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to remove any complexes that may have formed during storage. Separation of F(ab′) fragments from supernatants on a sizing column revealed single peaks of the expected molecular weight. For labeling of cell surface antigens, cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in PBS with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. About 106 cells in 50 μl of PBS were incubated with fluorescently tagged antibodies or F(ab′) fragments at saturating concentration for 30 min on ice in the dark. The applied antibody concentration (50–100 μg/ml) saturated all available binding sites. The excess mAb or F(ab′) fragment was removed by washing the cells twice in PBS. Cells were either used immediately for measurements or were fixed in 1% formaldehyde. Data obtained with fixed cells did not differ significantly from those of unfixed, viable cells. FRET measurements were carried out using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer to determine FRET efficiency between fluorescein- and rhodamine-conjugated mAb. In brief, the donor fluorescence was excited with the 488 nm line of an argon ion laser, and fluorescence emission of the donor was detected at 530 ± 30 nm. Donor fluorescence of the double-labeled samples was compared with that of samples where the acceptor antibody was replaced by non-labeled antibody to compensate for any competition between the donor and acceptor antibodies. FRET efficiency was calculated from the fractional decrease of the donor fluorescence in the presence of the acceptor. Flow cytometric FRET measurements to determine homoassociation of Cy-3- and Cy-5-labeled antigens were carried out using a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur flow cytometer. Four fluorescence intensities were measured. Three were excited at 488 nm and detected at 530 ± 30 nm, 585 ± 42 nm, and above 670 nm, whereas the fourth was excited at 635 nm and detected at 661 ± 16 nm. Correction factors for the spectral overlap between the different fluorescence channels were obtained from data measured on unlabeled and single-labeled cells. Forward and side angle light scattering were used to gate out debris and dead cells. We calculated the energy transfer efficiency on a cell-by-cell basis from the four fluorescence intensities on 10,000 cells using list mode data. Correction of autofluorescence was carried out on a cell-by-cell basis to eliminate the effect of low signal to noise ratios. Calculated values for the energy transfer efficiency were expressed as the ratio of the number of excited donor molecules tunneling their excitation energy to the acceptor, to the number of all excited molecules. The transfer efficiency is related to the inverse sixth power of the separation between the donor and the acceptor when the orientation factor of the donor's excitation and the acceptor's emission dipoles can be considered as a statistical average of random orientation (35Damjanovich S. Gaspar R. Pieri C. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 67-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The calculated energy transfer efficiency has an extremely high sensitivity to changes in distance within the range 1–10 nm. Larger energy transfer efficiencies may reflect closer physical association of the donor- and acceptor-labeled antibodies or a larger density of acceptor-labeled antibodies in the vicinity of donor-labeled antibodies (36Szollosi J.

Stimulated cells were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C in 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Sussex, UK). Nuclei and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C. For analysis of whole cell lysates by immunoblotting, samples (equivalent to 106 cells) were added to Laemmli's buffer and boiled for 5 min. For TCR-ζ immunoprecipitation the lysates were pre-cleared by rotating at 4 °C for 30–60 min with 40 μl of 50% packed protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech). Pre-cleared lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min or overnight with immunoprecipitating antibody. Immune complexes were recovered by incubation with 40 μl of 50% packed protein G-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer, re-suspended in Laemmli's buffer, and boiled for 5 min prior to separation using 7.5–15% gradient gels. For CD4 immunoprecipitates, cells were coated with CD4 mAb (QS4120) at 5 μg/ml for 30 min on ice prior to immunoprecipitation using protein G-Sepharose beads as above. For in vitro kinase assay, immune complexes were washed once in kinase buffer (50 mmPipes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm AEBSF). The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μm unlabeled ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and the reaction stopped by the addition of 30 μl of Laemmli's buffer and boiling for 5 min. Quantification of immunoblots and autoradiographs was carried out using a LAS-1000 CCD camera and AIDA imaging software (Fuji Photo Film Company). A CD45− sub-clone of HPB-ALL T leukemia cells (31Shiroo M. Goff L. Biffen M. Shivnan E. Alexander D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4887-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was used to generate stable transfectants expressing specific CD45 isoforms. Two CD45R0+ sub-clones were obtained from the same CD45− parental cell-line, generated in two different laboratories (CD45R0SD and CD45R0LG). Two further sub-clones were made expressing either the CD45RABC or CD45RBC isoforms. Initial experiments (data not shown) revealed that upon TCR stimulation or CD3-CD4 ligation, protein tyrosine phosphorylation and other signals were greatly reduced in both of the CD45R0+sub-clones in comparison with cells expressing either CD45RABC or CD45RBC. This result was surprising in light of previously published findings suggesting that CD45R0 may promote TCR signaling (22Novak T.J. Farber D. Leitenberg D. Hong S.C. Johnson P. Bottomly K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, as Fig. 1 illustrates, whereas the expression of the important signaling molecules Syk, ZAP-70, and p59fyn were found to be comparable between the HPB-ALL sub-clones (Fig. 1a), both CD45R0+ sub-clones expressed very low levels of p56lck, up to 20-fold lower than the expression level in the CD45RBC+ sub-clone (Fig.1b, upper panel). Furthermore, p56lckwas expressed 2-fold higher in the CD45RBC+ than in the CD45RABC+ sub-clone. Northern analysis revealed that Lck mRNA levels closely matched the protein expression differences (Fig. 1b, lower panel). The parental CD45− sub-clone also had low p56lckexpression, although not as low as the two CD45R0+sub-clones. Since the CD45R0+ sub-clones were independently generated, we cannot exclude the possibility that differential CD45 isoform expression regulates Lck mRNA levels, but the low p56lck expression in the CD45R0+ sub-clones might also be coincidental. Since p56lck is critical as the kinase that promotes TCR-ζ phosphorylation, thereby initiating downstream signaling cascades, the two CD45R0+ sub-clones were stably transfected with p56lck to generate a large number of clones expressing varying p56lck levels. Sub-clones were picked to match the CD45RBC+ and CD45RABC+sub-clones for p56lck expression, as well as for CD3, CD45, CD4, and CD8 expression (Fig. 2). We then measured the differential association of CD45 isoforms with CD4 and CD8 at the cell surface by FRET analysis. This technique has the advantage that it detects associations by FACS measurements using intact cells and avoids any requirement to expose the CD45 molecules to detergent. Measurements were carried out using F(ab)′ fragments bound to fluorophores rather than intact IgG molecules to avoid any cross-linking of the molecules under investigation. Either fluorescein or rhodamine were used in each experiment as fluorescence donor or acceptor molecules, thereby generating two energy transfer efficiency values for each antibody pair. Energy transfer efficiencies below 5% were ignored as “background noise”. Fig.3, a and b show that there was substantial association between CD45R0 and CD4 and CD8, respectively, but not between CD45RBC or CD45RABC with CD4 or CD8. The energy transfer values for CD45R0-CD4/CD8 association were found to be in the range 7.2–12.2%, demonstrating that a pool of CD45R0 molecules are within 10 nm at the cell-surface of a pool of CD4 or CD8 molecules. However, it should be noted that these values do not provide information about the percentage of molecules that associate. To confirm that these results were not unique to a particular HPB-ALL sub-clone, the FRET analysis for CD4-CD45R0 association was repeated on a total of five, and the CD8-CD45R0 association repeated on three, independent CD45R0+ sub-clones, with comparable results (data not shown).Figure 3FRET analysis of CD45 isoform associations. HPB-ALL sub-clones expressing CD45RABC, CD45RBC, or CD45R0 were labeled with F(ab′) fragments covalently bound to fluorescein (F) or rhodamine (R) used as either donor or acceptor. Associations were estimated by FACS analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures”. a andb show the mean energy transfer efficiency values ± S.D. calculated from six independent experiments for CD4 and CD8 associations, respectively. c, homodimerization analysis of CD45R0 (dashed line), CD45RABC (thick solid line), and CD45RBC (thin solid line) by FACS analysis of cells labeled with 50:50 mixtures of Cy-3/Cy-5-conjugated F(ab′) fragments. The data show are representative of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In light of recent reports that CD45 homodimerization may regulate CD45 function, it was also of interest to determine whether the various CD45 isomers homodimerized. To investigate this question, FRET analysis using the FACS was carried out on the different sub-clones labeled with a 50:50 mixture of Cy3- and Cy5-CD45 F(ab)′ fragments. Fig.3c shows that of the three CD45 isoforms under investigation, only CD45R0 was found as homodimers, generating energy transfer efficiency values of 11.0 ± 4.4 based on four independent experiments, in contrast to 1.2 ± 0.4 and 1.8 ± 1.4 for the CD45RBC+ and CD45RABC+ sub-clones, respectively. The homodimerization of CD45R0, together with the preferential association of CD45R0 with CD4 and CD8 expressed on the same cells, provided an interesting system for testing whether CD45R0 might exert a dominantly positive effect on signaling mediated by the TCR-CD4/CD8 complex, or whether the possible inhibition of CD45 tyrosine phosphatase activity by CD45R0 homodimerization might exert a negative effect on TCR signaling. To distinguish these possibilities we carried out a detailed investigation on the strength of TCR signal transduction in the CD45RBC+ sub-clone compared with CD45R0SD7, a sub-clone matched for p56lck, CD3, CD45, CD4, and CD8 expression (Fig. 2). We surmised that the close association between CD45R0 and CD4 molecules (Fig. 3a) might generate a pool of CD4-associated p56lck that was more active in the CD45R0+ than in the CD45RBC+sub-clone, due to dephosphorylation of the inhibitory p56lck pTyr-505 by CD45. To investigate this possibility,in vitro kinase assays were carried out in CD4 immunocomplexes derived from cell-surface CD4 molecules, and p56lck activity was assessed by autophosphorylation. Fig.4a illustrates two representative experiments demonstrating that the CD4-associated p56lckkinase activity was, on average, 2-fold higher in the CD45R0+ than in the CD45RBC+ sub-clone. Consistent with this finding, basal protein tyrosine phosphorylation levels were consistently higher in the CD45R0+ than in the CD45RBC+ cells (Fig. 4b). Among the hyper-phosphorylated proteins were the proto-oncogene c-Cbl (38Lupher M.L. Rao N. Eck M.J. Band H. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), p56lck, and the p21 TCR-ζ phosphoisomer (arrowed in Fig. 4b; identification of the molecules is illus"

In general, these nuclear receptors consist of several functional domains: an N-terminal ligand-independent transactivation domain (AF-11), a DNA-binding domain (DBD) that contains two zinc fingers, a hinge domain that is a variable linker region and a functionally complex C-terminal region that includes the ligand-binding domain, the dimerization interface, and the ligand-dependent transactivation domain (AF-2) (1Beato M.

These nuclear receptors regulate expression of genes that function in a variety of metabolic pathways.Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ is a transcription factor, belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily.

In contrast, individuals with a loss-of-function mutation in the PPARγ gene developed early-onset type 2 diabetes with severe insulin resistance (13Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M.

Therefore, endogenous modulators of PPARγ should affect the insulin sensitivity.Small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor composed of 257 amino acids (human protein) or 260 amino acids (murine protein) that lacks a conventional DBD (14Seol W.

Recently we reported that mutations in SHP gene in humans associated with insulin resistance and mild obesity (19Nishigori H. Tomura H. Tonooka N. Kanamori M. Yamada S. Sho K. Inoue I. Kikuchi N.

The underlying mechanism by which mutations in SHP gene represented such phenotypes has been unclear. We hypothesized that SHP might affect the transcriptional activation activity of PPARγ.In the present study, we demonstrated that SHP up-regulated the transcriptional activity of PPARγ through the direct binding to the DBD/hinge region of PPARγ. SHP inhibited the repressor activity of nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR). The mutant SHP proteins found in the subjects with SHP mutation had decreased activation activity for PPARγ. Our data suggest that SHP may act as an endogenous enhancer of PPARγ.DISCUSSIONSHP was originally cloned, by a yeast two-hybrid system, as an associate protein to mCAR, a close murine relative of the human orphan nuclear receptor MB67 (14Seol W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Google Scholar). SHP mRNA is expressed abundantly in the liver, heart, and pancreas (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Google Scholar), but its transcript has been detected quite ubiquitously (15Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Google Scholar). The effect of SHP on transactivation activity of PPARγ has not been evaluated. In the present study, we demonstrated that SHP mRNA is expressed in adipose tissues, in which PPARγ predominantly functions. Unlike other nuclear receptors, SHP increased the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. This activation was significantly diminished in the mutant SHP proteins found in naturally occurring mutations.The interaction of SHP with PPARγ was quite different from that with other nuclear receptors. In previous studies, SHP exhibited repressor activity in its C terminus and functioned by binding to the AF-2 domain of the target receptors (15Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G.

Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Google Scholar, 17Seol W. Chung M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7126-7131Google Scholar). In contrast, we demonstrated that SHP bound to a part of the DBD and the hinge domain of PPARγ and exerted enhancing activity at the C terminus. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which SHP activates the transcriptional activity of the PPARγ·RXRα heterodimer is not clear, however, one or more of the following mechanisms might be involved: 1) SHP might directly inhibit the binding of the PPARγ·RXRα complex to PPRE (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Google Scholar). 2) SHP might compete with the corepressors for binding to PPARγ. 3) SHP may possess its own activating function in its C terminus (17Seol W. Chung M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7126-7131Google Scholar). SHP inhibited DNA binding of RAR·RXR (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Google Scholar) but showed no effect on that of ERα, HNF4α, or LRH-1 (15Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Google Scholar, 16Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Google Scholar, 18Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R.

In the present study, we were unable to demonstrate a significant effect of SHP on binding of PPARγ·RXRα to PPRE (data not shown). SHP competes with some coactivators for binding to nuclear receptors, including SRC-3 to HNF4α and TIF2 to ERα (15Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Google Scholar, 16Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Google Scholar). NCoR functions as a corepressor for PPARγ. In our study, SHP competed with NCoR for binding to PPARγ and increased the activity. Dissociation of NCoR may cause a conformational change of PPARγ with subsequent activation. Other mechanisms may be involved in this augmentation, because SHP still enhanced PPARγ activity even in the presence of its ligand, in which NCoR dissociates from PPARγ (27Oberfield J.L. Collins J.L. Holmes C.P. Goreham D.M. Cooper J.P. Cobb J.E. Lenhard J.M. Hull-Ryde E.A. Mohr C.P. Blanchard S.G. Parks D.J. Moore L.B. Lehmann J.M. Plunket K. Miller A.B. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6102-6106Google Scholar). PGC-1 is one of the coactivators of PPARγ (26Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar). Docking of PGC-1 to the DBD/hinge domain of PPARγ results in a state permissive for binding of other cofactors such as SRC-1 and CREB-binding protein, followed by activation of the receptor (31Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Google Scholar). SHP may activate PPARγ by a mechanism similar to PGC-1.Our results also showed that mutant SHP proteins, found in naturally occurring mutations, had less enhancing activity for PPARγ than WT-SHP. All mutants have an abnormal C-terminal region. Serial C-terminal deletion mutants also showed less enhancing activity. These mutant proteins had a normal N terminus and retained the binding activity for PPARγ. In this regard, a recent report (32Johansson L. Bavner A. Thomsen J.S. Farnegardh M. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1124-1133Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the LXXLL-related motif in the N terminus of SHP is important for binding to ER. Another atypical orphan receptor, DAX-1, which is the closest relative of SHP, also has a binding domain for nuclear receptors in the N terminus (33Ito M. Yu R. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1476-1483Google Scholar, 34Zazopoulos E. Lalli E. Stocco D.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1997; 390: 311-315Google Scholar, 35Zanaria E. Muscatelli F. Bardoni B. Strom T.M. Guioli S.

The C terminus of SHP may activate PPARγ in co-operation with the N-terminal domain. Accordingly, further investigation of the functional interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions should provide new insight into the mechanism(s) of SHP-mediated PPARγ transactivation. It has been reported that SHP represses the activity of the RXR homodimer to the RXRE-containing promoter (16Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Google Scholar). Although SHP increases the activity of PPARγ·RXRα heterodimer complex, it is possible that the mutant SHP proteins with the abnormal C terminus may have a more potent repressor activity for RXRα than WT, resulting in reduced activity for the PPARγ·RXRα complex. Further studies are necessary to analyze the direct effect of SHP on the heterodimeric partner RXRα of the PPARγ complex.Genetic mutations of SHP in human subjects are associated with insulin resistance and mild obesity (19Nishigori H. Tomura H. Tonooka N. Kanamori M. Yamada S. Sho K. Inoue I. Kikuchi N. Onigata K. Kojima I. Kohama T. Yamagata K. Yang Q. Matsuzawa Y. Miki T. Seino S. Kim M.Y. Choi H.S. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Google Scholar). Activation of PPARγ by its synthetic ligands increases insulin sensitivity (10Iwamoto Y. Kuzuya T. Matsuda A. Awata T. Kumakura S. Inooka G. Shiraishi I. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 1083-1086Google Scholar, 11Fujiwara T. Yoshioka S. Yoshioka T. Ushiyama I. Horikoshi H. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1549-1558Google Scholar, 12Day C. Diabet. Med. 1999; 16: 179-192Google Scholar). Individuals with a dominant negative mutation of the PPARγ gene have been reported to develop severe insulin resistance (13Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that mutant SHPs exhibit less enhancing activity on PPARγ than WT. These observations suggest that less enhancing activity of PPARγ by mutant SHP proteins may be involved in insulin resistance in subjects with SHP mutation. On the other hand, it is still not clear how SHP mutations contribute to mild obesity. SHP mutations are associated with abnormally high birth weight and early-onset obesity (19Nishigori H. Tomura H. Tonooka N. Kanamori M. Yamada S. Sho K. Inoue I. Kikuchi N. Onigata K. Kojima I. Kohama T. Yamagata K. Yang Q. Matsuzawa Y. Miki T. Seino S. Kim M.Y. Choi H.S. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Google Scholar). Because SHP inhibits the activities of various other nuclear receptors, including RAR, TR, ER, HNF4α, and LRH-1, the clinical phenotypes of the SHP mutation cannot be accounted for only by the SHP-PPARγ pathway. Loss of SHP function might lead to increased activity of HNF4α and may increase the secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells. Because insulin is one of the key hormones involved in adipogenesis, increased insulin secretion in utero could promote intrauterine growth of adipose tissue and predispose to postnatal obesity in affected individuals.Although detailed analysis of SHP interaction with PPARγ remains to be completed, our finding that SHP enhances the transcriptional activity of PPARγ might allow the design of new approaches to the treatment of insulin resistance syndrome. Because SHP has a putative ligand-binding domain in the C-terminal region, identification of the putative SHP ligands or agonists may allow the design of a new class of therapeutic agents to combat insulin resistance. The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of transcription factors that regulate target genes in response to small lipophilic compounds such as steroids, thyroid hormone, and retinoids (1Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Google Scholar, 2Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Google Scholar, 3Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Google Scholar, 4Owen G.I. Zelent A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 809-827Google Scholar). In general, these nuclear receptors consist of several functional domains: an N-terminal ligand-independent transactivation domain (AF-11), a DNA-binding domain (DBD) that contains two zinc fingers, a hinge domain that is a variable linker region and a functionally complex C-terminal region that includes the ligand-binding domain, the dimerization interface, and the ligand-dependent transactivation domain (AF-2) (1Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Google Scholar, 2Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Google Scholar, 3Enmark E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol.

These nuclear receptors regulate expression of genes that function in a variety of metabolic pathways. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ is a transcription factor, belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily. PPARγ is a master regulator for adipocyte differentiation (5Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Google Scholar, 6Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Google Scholar) and is important in regulation of a number of genes involved in fatty acid and glucose metabolism (7Lefebvre A.M. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Leitersdorf I. Briggs M.R. Paterniti J.R. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Auwerx J. Staels B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1756-1764Google Scholar, 8Young P.W. Cawthorne M.A. Coyle P.J. Holder J.C.

Invest. 1998; 101: 22-32Google Scholar). Synthetic PPARγ ligands, thiazolidinedione drugs, increase insulin sensitivity and are used in the treatment of diabetic patients (10Iwamoto Y. Kuzuya T. Matsuda A. Awata T. Kumakura S. Inooka G. Shiraishi I. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 1083-1086Google Scholar, 11Fujiwara T. Yoshioka S. Yoshioka T. Ushiyama I. Horikoshi H. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1549-1558Google Scholar, 12Day C. Diabet. Med. 1999; 16: 179-192Google Scholar). In contrast, individuals with a loss-of-function mutation in the PPARγ gene developed early-onset type 2 diabetes with severe insulin resistance (13Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Google Scholar). Therefore, endogenous modulators of PPARγ should affect the insulin sensitivity. Small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor composed of 257 amino acids (human protein) or 260 amino acids (murine protein) that lacks a conventional DBD (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Google Scholar). It has been reported that SHP interacts with several other nuclear receptors and modulates the transcriptional activities (14Seol W.

Seino S. Kim M.Y. Choi H.S. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Google Scholar). Recently we reported that mutations in SHP gene in humans associated with insulin resistance and mild obesity (19Nishigori H. Tomura H. Tonooka N. Kanamori M. Yamada S. Sho K. Inoue I. Kikuchi N. Onigata K. Kojima I. Kohama T. Yamagata K. Yang Q. Matsuzawa Y. Miki T. Seino S. Kim M.Y. Choi H.S. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism by which mutations in SHP gene represented such phenotypes has been unclear. We hypothesized that SHP might affect the transcriptional activation activity of PPARγ. In the present study, we demonstrated that SHP up-regulated the transcriptional activity of PPARγ through the direct binding to the DBD/hinge region of PPARγ. SHP inhibited the repressor activity of nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR). The mutant SHP proteins found in the subjects with SHP mutation had decreased activation activity for PPARγ. Our data suggest that SHP may act as an endogenous enhancer of PPARγ. DISCUSSIONSHP was originally cloned, by a yeast two-hybrid system, as an associate protein to mCAR, a close murine relative of the human orphan nuclear receptor MB67 (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D.

To date, SHP has been reported to function as a repressor of various nuclear receptors, including RAR, TR, RXR, ER, HNF4α and LRH-1 (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Google Scholar). SHP mRNA is expressed abundantly in the liver, heart, and pancreas (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Google Scholar), but its transcript has been detected quite ubiquitously (15Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Google Scholar). The effect of SHP on transactivation activity of PPARγ has not been evaluated. In the present study, we demonstrated that SHP mRNA is expressed in adipose tissues, in which PPARγ predominantly functions. Unlike other nuclear receptors, SHP increased the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. This activation was significantly diminished in the mutant SHP proteins found in naturally occurring mutations.The interaction of SHP with PPARγ was quite different from that with other nuclear receptors. In previous studies, SHP exhibited repressor activity in its C terminus and functioned by binding to the AF-2 domain of the target receptors (15Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G.

Tonooka N. Kanamori M. Yamada S. Sho K. Inoue I. Kikuchi N. Onigata K. Kojima I. Kohama T. Yamagata K. Yang Q. Matsuzawa Y. Miki T. Seino S. Kim M.Y. Choi H.S. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Google Scholar). Because SHP inhibits the activities of various other nuclear receptors, including RAR, TR, ER, HNF4α, and LRH-1, the clinical phenotypes of the SHP mutation cannot be accounted for only by the SHP-PPARγ pathway. Loss of SHP function might lead to increased activity of HNF4α and may increase the secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells. Because insulin is one of the key hormones involved in adipogenesis, increased insulin secretion in utero could promote intrauterine growth of adipose tissue and predispose to postnatal obesity in affected individuals.Although detailed analysis of SHP interaction with PPARγ remains to be completed, our finding that SHP enhances the transcriptional activity of PPARγ might allow the design of new approaches to the treatment of insulin resistance syndrome. Because SHP has a putative ligand-binding domain in the C-terminal region, identification of the putative SHP ligands or agonists may allow the design of a new class of therapeutic agents to combat insulin resistance. SHP was originally cloned, by a yeast two-hybrid system, as an associate protein to mCAR, a close murine relative of the human orphan nuclear receptor MB67 (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Google Scholar, 30Baes M. Gulick T. Choi H.S. Martinoli M.G. Simha D. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1544-1551Google Scholar). To date, SHP has been reported to function as a repressor of various nuclear receptors, including RAR, TR, RXR, ER, HNF4α and LRH-1 (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Google Scholar, 15Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Google Scholar, 16Lee Y.K. Dell H.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Google Scholar). SHP mRNA is expressed abundantly in the liver, heart, and pancreas (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Google Scholar), but its transcript has been detected quite ubiquitously (15Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Google Scholar). The effect of SHP on transactivation activity of PPARγ has not been evaluated. In the present study, we demonstrated that SHP mRNA is expressed in adipose tissues, in which PPARγ predominantly functions. Unlike other nuclear receptors, SHP increased the transcriptional activity of PPARγ. This activation was significantly diminished in the mutant SHP proteins found in naturally occurring mutations. The interaction of SHP with PPARγ was quite different from that with other nuclear receptors. In previous studies, SHP exhibited repressor activity in its C terminus and functioned by binding to the AF-2 domain of the target receptors (15Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Google Scholar, 16Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell.

In contrast, we demonstrated that SHP bound to a part of the DBD and the hinge domain of PPARγ and exerted enhancing activity at the C terminus. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which SHP activates the transcriptional activity of the PPARγ·RXRα heterodimer is not clear, however, one or more of the following mechanisms might be involved: 1) SHP might directly inhibit the binding of the PPARγ·RXRα complex to PPRE (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Google Scholar). 2) SHP might compete with the corepressors for binding to PPARγ. 3) SHP may possess its own activating function in its C terminus (17Seol W. Chung M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7126-7131Google Scholar). SHP inhibited DNA binding of RAR·RXR (14Seol W. Choi H.S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Google Scholar) but showed no effect on that of ERα, HNF4α, or LRH-1 (15Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Google Scholar, 16Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Google Scholar, 18Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R.

In the present study, we were unable to demonstrate a significant effect of SHP on binding of PPARγ·RXRα to PPRE (data not shown). SHP competes with some coactivators for binding to nuclear receptors, including SRC-3 to HNF4α and TIF2 to ERα (15Johansson L. Thomsen J.S. Damdimopoulos A.E. Spyrou G. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 345-353Google Scholar, 16Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Google Scholar). NCoR functions as a corepressor for PPARγ. In our study, SHP competed with NCoR for binding to PPARγ and increased the activity. Dissociation of NCoR may cause a conformational change of PPARγ with subsequent activation. Other mechanisms may be involved in this augmentation, because SHP still enhanced PPARγ activity even in the presence of its ligand, in which NCoR dissociates from PPARγ (27Oberfield J.L. Collins J.L. Holmes C.P. Goreham D.M. Cooper J.P. Cobb J.E. Lenhard J.M. Hull-Ryde E.A. Mohr C.P. Blanchard S.G. Parks D.J. Moore L.B. Lehmann J.M. Plunket K. Miller A.B. Milburn M.V. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6102-6106Google Scholar). PGC-1 is one of the coactivators of PPARγ (26Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Google Scholar). Docking of PGC-1 to the DBD/hinge domain of PPARγ results in a state permissive for binding of other cofactors such as SRC-1 and CREB-binding protein, followed by activation of the receptor (31Puigserver P. Adelmant G. Wu Z. Fan M. Xu J. O'Malley B. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1999; 286: 1368-1371Google Scholar). SHP may activate PPARγ by a mechanism similar to PGC-1. Our results also showed that mutant SHP proteins, found in naturally occurring mutations, had less enhancing activity for PPARγ than WT-SHP. All mutants have an abnormal C-terminal region. Serial C-terminal deletion mutants also showed less enhancing activity. These mutant proteins had a normal N terminus and retained the binding activity for PPARγ. In this regard, a recent report (32Johansson L. Bavner A. Thomsen J.S. Farnegardh M. Gustafsson J.A. Treuter E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1124-1133Google Scholar) has demonstrated that the LXXLL-related motif in the N terminus of SHP is important for binding to ER. Another atypical orphan receptor, DAX-1, which is the closest relative of SHP, also has a binding domain for nuclear receptors in the N terminus (33Ito M. Yu R. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1476-1483Google Scholar, 34Zazopoulos E. Lalli E. Stocco D.M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1997; 390: 311-315Google Scholar, 35Zanaria E. Muscatelli F. Bardoni B. Strom T.M. Guioli S.

The C terminus of SHP may activate PPARγ in co-operation with the N-terminal domain. Accordingly, further investigation of the functional interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions should provide new insight into the mechanism(s) of SHP-mediated PPARγ transactivation. It has been reported that SHP represses the activity of the RXR homodimer to the RXRE-containing promoter (16Lee Y.K. Dell H. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Google Scholar). Although SHP increases the activity of PPARγ·RXRα heterodimer complex, it is possible that the mutant SHP proteins with the abnormal C terminus may have a more potent repressor activity for RXRα than WT, resulting in reduced activity for the PPARγ·RXRα complex. Further studies are necessary to analyze the direct effect of SHP on the heterodimeric partner RXRα of the PPARγ complex. Genetic mutations of SHP in human subjects are associated with insulin resistance and mild obesity (19Nishigori H. Tomura H. Tonooka N. Kanamori M. Yamada S. Sho K. Inoue I. Kikuchi N. Onigata K. Kojima I. Kohama T. Yamagata K. Yang Q. Matsuzawa Y. Miki T. Seino S. Kim M.Y. Choi H.S. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Takeda J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 575-580Google Scholar). Activation of PPARγ by its synthetic ligands increases insulin sensitivity (10Iwamoto Y. Kuzuya T. Matsuda A. Awata T. Kumakura S. Inooka G. Shiraishi I. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 1083-1086Google Scholar, 11Fujiwara T. Yoshioka S. Yoshioka T. Ushiyama I. Horikoshi H. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1549-1558Google Scholar, 12Day C. Diabet. Med. 1999; 16: 179-192Google Scholar). Individuals with a dominant negative mutation of the PPARγ gene have been reported to develop severe insulin resistance (13Barroso I. Gurnell M. Crowley V.E. Agostini M. Schwabe J.W. Soos M.A. Maslen G.L. Williams T.D. Lewis H. Schafer A.J. Chatterjee V.K. O'Rahilly S. Nature. 1999; 402: 880-883Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that mutant SHPs exhibit less enhancing activity on PPARγ than WT. These observations suggest that less enhancing activity of PPARγ by mutant SHP proteins may be involved in insulin resistance in subjects with SHP mutation. On the other hand, it is still not clear how SHP mutations contribute to mild obesity. SHP mutations are associated with abnormally high birth weight and early-onset obesity (19Nishigori H. Tomura H.

https://openalex.org/W2084905877,"The Ccr4-Not complex is a global regulator of transcription that affects genes positively and negatively and is thought to regulate transcription factor IID function. Two components of this complex, Caf1p and Ccr4p, are directly involved in mRNA deadenylation, and Caf1p is associated with Dhh1p, a putative RNA helicase thought to be a component of the decapping complex. In this work, we tried to determine whether Dhh1p might interact with the Ccr4-Not complex. We found that, first, not mutations displayed severe synthetic phenotypes when combined with adhh1-null mutation. Second, overexpression of Not1p was toxic in dhh1-null cells. Third, a not mutant phenotype was suppressed by deletion of DHH1 and mimicked by overexpression of DHH1. Fourth, dhh1-null mutants displayed resistance to heat shock, a phenotype observed for all mutants that affect the Ccr4-Not complex. Finally, like Caf1p and Ccr4p, Dhh1p co-immunoprecipitated with the nonessential N-terminal domain of Not1p, and the levels of Caf1p and Dhh1p were dependent upon this Not1p domain. Taken together, our results suggest that the Ccr4-Not complex, via the N-terminal region of Not1p, is necessary for the maintenance of stable cellular levels of Dhh1p and Caf1p, thus contributing to regulation of mRNA decay in addition to transcription.

The components of this complex were identified in separate genetic screens. The NOT genes were isolated in a selection for mutants that were 3-aminotriazole (AT)1-resistant when carrying a mutant, activation-defective derivative of Gnc4p instead of the endogenous wild-type protein (1Collart M.A. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Collart M.A. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Oberholzer U. Collart M.A. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The selection was directed toward mutants that displayed increased HIS3 transcription, and these mutants were additionally selected as displaying increased expression of a HIS3-lacZ reporter gene. Thenot mutants were shown to increase transcription preferentially from the TATA-less promoters of the HIS3 andHIS4 genes. Finally, both genetic and biochemical experiments demonstrated that the five Not proteins functioned together in a high molecular mass complex (2Collart M.A. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Oberholzer U. Collart M.A. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4Maillet L. Tu C. Hong Y.K. Shuster E.O. Collart M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In separate experiments, the Ccr4 protein and its associated factor Caf1p, also known as Pop2p (8Sakai A. Chibazakura Y. Shimizu Y. Hishinuma F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6227-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), were identified as proteins required for glucose derepression of gene expression (5Draper M.P. Salvadore C. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3487-3495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Denis C.L. Genetics. 1984; 108: 833-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Denis C.L. Malvar T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6227-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), in particular for alcohol dehydrogenase II expression. A large 1.2-MDa complex containing Caf1p, Ccr4p, and the five Not proteins was isolated (9Liu H.-Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These seven proteins also co-fractionate in larger 2-MDa complexes (4Maillet L. Tu C. Hong Y.K. Shuster E.O. Collart M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Whereas only Not1p is essential for yeast viability, the Ccr4-Not complex is probably essential for yeast vegetative growth, and only Not1p is absolutely essential for its integrity or function (4Maillet L. Tu C. Hong Y.K. Shuster E.O. Collart M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The role of the Ccr4-Not complex is still not clearly understood. It is generally thought of as a transcriptional regulator that affects TFIID function and belongs to the category of intermediary factors. In support of a role in transcription, interactions of given components of the complex with the TATA box-binding protein and particular yeast TBP-associated factors (yTafII proteins) have been described (10Lemaire M. Collart M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26925-26934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Lee T.I. Wyrick J.J. Koh S.S. Jennings E.G. Gadbois E.L. Young R.A. Mol. Cell.

Maillet, M. Molinete, G. Theiler, M. Lenaire, N. Paquet, and M. A. Collart, submitted for publication., 3L. Maillet and M. A. Collart, manuscript in preparation.There are also functional links to components of another yTafII-containing complex, namely the Spt-Ada-GCN5 acetyltransferase complex (13Benson J.D. Benson M. Howley P.M. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6714-6722Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Collart M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6668-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and to other proteins involved in transcription. Accordingly, Ccr4p itself is a component of the Paf1p holoenzyme (15Chang M. French-Cormay D. Fan H.-Y. Klein H. Denis C.L. Jaehning J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1056-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and some Ccr4-Not proteins are associated with the Srb9–11 proteins (16Liu H.-Y. Chiang Y.-C. Pan J. Chen J. Salvadore C. Audino D.C. Badarinarayana V. Palaniswamy V. Anderson B. Denis C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7541-7548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Certain observations are, however, not in agreement with a unique role for the Ccr4-Not complex in regulating transcription. Indeed, mutation or deletion of each of the different components of the complex displays a very unique set of phenotypes. For instance, all of thenot mutants are AT-resistant, but neither ccr4nor caf1 mutants are. This distinction can be correlated with the observation that, whereas Ccr4p and Caf1p are associated with the N-terminal domain of Not1p, the Not proteins are associated with the essential C-terminal domain of Not1p (4Maillet L. Tu C. Hong Y.K. Shuster E.O. Collart M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Bai Y. Salvadore C. Chiang Y.-C. Collart M.A. Liu H.-Y. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6642-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The Not1 protein itself is the only known component of the Ccr4-Not complex that is essential for yeast viability. The C-terminal domain of Not1p is sufficient for yeast vegetative growth, but wild-type yeast vegetative growth requires the interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains within Ccr4-Not complexes (4Maillet L. Tu C. Hong Y.K. Shuster E.O. Collart M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Another point is that interactions between components of the Ccr4-Not complex and factors unrelated to transcription have been described. Both Caf1p and Ccr4p were shown to interact with the cell cycle-regulated protein kinase Dbf2p (16Liu H.-Y. Chiang Y.-C. Pan J. Chen J. Salvadore C. Audino D.C. Badarinarayana V. Palaniswamy V.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5289-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Caf1p and Ccr4p are associated with the major yeast cytoplasmic deadenylase (19Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and a recombinant fragment of Caf1p was shown to degrade poly(A) in vitro(20Daugeron M.-C. Mauxion F. Séraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), demonstrating that Caf1p is a nuclease. An additional link to mRNA degradation is the DEAD box putative RNA helicase Dhh1p (21Strahl-Bolsinger S. Tanner W. Yeast. 1993; 9: 429-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), which is associated in vivo with Caf1p (22Hata H. Mitsui H. Liu H. Bai Y. Denis C.L. Shimizu Y. Sakai A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 571-579PubMed Google Scholar). This helicase is thought to be a component of the decapping complex (19Tucker M. Valencia-Sanchez M.A. Staples R.R. Chen J. Denis C.L. Parker R. Cell. 2001; 104: 377-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) and indeed interacts in the two-hybrid assay with the decapping enzyme Dcp1p (23Uetz P. Giot L. Cagney G. Mansfield T.A. Judson R.S. Knight J.R. Lockshon D. Narayan V. Srinivasan M. Pochart P. QureshiEmili A. Li Y. Godwin B. Conover D. Kalbfleisch T. Jijayadamodar G. Yang M.J. Johnston M. Fields S. Rothberg J.M. Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3922) Google Scholar). It is hard to reconcile the large number of described partners for the Ccr4-Not complex with a unique function or even with a unique complex. In fact, we have evidence that, although the 1.2-MDa complex is a defined entity that can be purified (9Liu H.-Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), the previously described 2-MDa complex (4Maillet L. Tu C. Hong Y.K. Shuster E.O. Collart M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) is probably not a unique entity. 4L. Maillet and M. A. Collart, unpublished data. In this work, we wanted to determine whether Dhh1p, probably involved in the degradation of mRNAs like Caf1p and Ccr4p, interacts with the Ccr4-Not complex. First, we demonstrated striking genetic interactions between DHH1 and the NOT genes. Second, we were able to demonstrate that the N-terminal region of Not1p is indeed essential for the maintenance of stable levels of both Caf1p and Dhh1p in vivo. This correlates with an interaction between the N-terminal domain of Not1p and the two factors, an interaction that is likely to occur within the context of Ccr4-Not complexes. Taken together with the established links between the Ccr4-Not complex and transcription and our more recent finding that the Ccr4-Not complex contributes to regulation of stress responses and responses through the protein kinase A pathway, 5E. Lenssen, U. Oberholzer, J. Labarre, C. de Virgilio, and M. A. Collart, Mol. Microbiol., in press. this work provides a new view of the Ccr4-Not complex as a general coordinator of the regulation of gene expression via several pathways. All media were standard. To obtain adhh1-null strain, we backcrossed the strain received (MY2700) (Table I) three times with MY1 and selected for dhh1-null spores lackingGCN4 after the first backcross. During these backcrosses, we noticed that dhh1 could be ts+ or ts− at 37 °C for a reason that we could not assign to any known locus. We repeatedly chose the ts+ spores. After the third backcross, the dhh1-null strain mostly isogenic to our strains was crossed once more with the various ccr4-notmutants, and the double mutants were obtained by tetrad analysis. To test for AT resistance, all of the strains that have a deletion ofGCN4 on the chromosome were transformed with aLEU2 centromeric plasmid expressing an N-terminally deleted derivative of Gcn4p (C-163). Wild-type cells expressing this derivative cannot grow even on 5 mm AT, whereas not mutants grow on at least 40 mm AT. All AT tests were done on 20 mm AT. Wild-type cells or cells expressing intrans the C- and N-terminal domains of Not1p and expressing HA-tagged Dhh1p were created by transformation as described below. To obtain cells expressing only the C-terminal domain of Not1p and HA-tagged Dhh1p, the transformants obtained from the complemented cells were streaked onto 5-fluoroorotic acid, a drug that kills cells carrying a functional URA3 gene.Table IS. cerevisiae strainsStrainGenotypeRef. or sourceMY1MATatrp1Δ1 leu2∷PET56 ura3–52 gcn4Δgal22Collart M.A. Struhl K.

The plasmid overexpressing Caf1p used to assay for AT resistance was obtained by amplification ofCAF1 sequences from genomic DNA and cloning as aHindIII-BamHI fragment into pRS426. The plasmids overexpressing partial Caf1p, Ccr4p, or Not1p in galactose medium or overexpressing Ccr4p in glucose medium have been described previously (2Collart M.A. Struhl K.

To create an HA-tagged version of Dhh1p, oligonucleotides F2 (5′-TTT CAT GGC GAT GCC ACC TGG TCA GTC ACA ACC CCA GTA TCG GAT CCC CGG GTT AAT TAA-3′) and R1 (5′-GCG TAT CTC ACC ACA GTA GTT ATT TTT TCT TAG ATA TTC TGA ATT CGA GCT CGT TTA AAC-3′) were used for PCR amplifica- tion from vector pFA6a-3HA-kanMX6(25Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. Demarini D.J. Shah M.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar), and the PCR product was transformed into the desired strain. The G418-resistant transformants were verified for the correct integration events using oligonucleotides within theDHH1 sequence (5′-CCC ATT CCC GAT AGA GCA AC-3′) and within the kanMX6 gene (5′-CCT CAG TGG CAA ATC CTA ACC-3′). Protein extracts were prepared as described below, and equivalent amounts of extract were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. After transfer of the SDS-polyacrylamide gels onto nitrocellulose, the desired proteins were revealed by probing with specific antibodies against LexAp (kind gift from Roger Brent) at 1:3000 dilution, Ccr4p at 1:3000, Caf1p at 1:3000, HA (Babco) at 1:3000, and Dob1p (kind gift from Patrick Linder) at 1:3000; and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) were used at 1:10,000 dilution. Total protein extracts were prepared as previously described (4Maillet L. Tu C. Hong Y.K. Shuster E.O. Collart M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) by bead-beating in 350 mm NaCl, 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors, followed by clarification by ultracentrifugation. The Superose 6 gel filtration assays were carried out as previously described (4Maillet L. Tu C. Hong Y.K. Shuster E.O. Collart M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, 300 μl of total cell extracts were loaded onto a Superose 6 gel filtration column equilibrated with 350 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.3). The column was run at 0.4 ml/min; and 400-μl fractions were collected starting at 16 min, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, and analyzed by Western blotting. The position of the void volume was determined by the elution of salmon sperm DNA and corresponds to the fraction just prior to the fraction that we have labeled 1. The column was calibrated using Bio-Rad markers for gel filtration. Total protein extracts were prepared as described above for the gel filtration experiments. 2 mg of extract were immunoprecipitated with 1 μl of goat anti-LexAp antibody (Babco) or 1 μl of rabbit anti-Not1p antibody (raised against amino acids 1–241), followed by protein G-Sepharose. To measure resistance to heat shock, cells were grown overnight in glucose-rich medium, diluted in the same medium to A600 nm = 0.1 in the morning, allowed to grow to A600 nm = 1.0, and incubated at 50 °C for various lengths of time. Equivalent amounts of cells after different time points were plated on glucose-rich medium and left to grow at 30 °C. The amount of cells forming colonies was then calculated. The amount of colonies formed from cells not subjected to the heat shock was calculated as 100%. Total cellular RNA was extracted as previously described by the hot acid/phenol method (1Collart M.A. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and 50 μg were hybridized to the DHH1 probe (5′-CCC AAT GTA CGG ACG ACT TGG GAA GTT TGC AGA GCT AAC TCT CTT GTG GGA ACC CCG C-3′) and to theDED1 probe (1Collart M.A. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as an internal control. After digestion by S1 nuclease, the hybridized oligonucleotides were analyzed on a sequencing gel. DHH1was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of acaf1-null mutant (caf1Δ), and Dhh1p was shown to interact physically with Caf1p (22Hata H. Mitsui H. Liu H. Bai Y. Denis C.L. Shimizu Y. Sakai A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 571-579PubMed Google Scholar). Because Caf1p is a component of the Ccr4-Not complex, we wanted to determine first whether there were any genetic interactions between DHH1 and the NOTgenes. We introduced a dhh1-null mutation (dhh1Δ) into our genetic background (see “Materials and Methods”) and created double mutants by crosses. TableII shows that like caf1- andccr4-null mutations, a dhh1-null mutation displayed very dramatic synthetic phenotypes when combined withnot mutations (Fig. 1,A and B). In particular, not1-2, which is synthetically lethal when combined with any mutation in anotherCCR4-NOT gene, except NOT3, was lethal when combined with a dhh1-null mutant. This synthetic lethality could be confirmed by introduction of a wild-typeNOT1 gene on a URA3 plasmid into the diploid prior to dissection. Indeed, double-deleted spores carrying theURA3 plasmid could be obtained, but could not grow on plates with 5-fluoroorotic acid, a drug that kills cells carrying a functionalURA3 gene. Interestingly, we found that dhh1Δwas also synthetically lethal when combined with a caf1-null mutation (Table II), in contrast to what has been previously published (22Hata H. Mitsui H. Liu H. Bai Y. Denis C.L. Shimizu Y. Sakai A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 571-579PubMed Google Scholar). This could be verified by introduction of either the wild-typeCAF1 or DHH1 gene on a URA3 plasmid prior to dissection and recovery of double mutant spores carrying theURA3 plasmid. These spores could not grow on 5-fluoroorotic acid.Table IIPhenotypes of double mutantsnot1–1not1–2not3Δnot4Δnot5Δnot5–1ccr4Δcaf1Δdhh1Δ(−)LethalSYN(−)LethalSYN(−)SYN(−)(−)Lethalcaf1Δ(−)LethalSYN(−)LethalLethalLethal(−)ccr4Δ(−)Lethal(−)LethalLethalLethalThe phenotypes of the double mutants on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose at 30 °C are listed.

Lethal means inviable; (−) indicates that the double mutant grows like the slower growing single mutants; and SYN(−) indicates a slightly slow growth phenotype compared with that of the slower growing single mutant. The strains used in the crosses are listed in Table I. These first experiments revealed surprisingly that the dhh1Δ not1Δ double mutant spores carrying an episomal copy ofNOT1 grew slower than the dhh1Δ single mutant. To investigate this finding further, we transformed dhh1Δ cells with a multicopy plasmid overexpressing NOT1specifically in galactose-containing medium. The transformed cells grew much slower than dhh1Δ cells transformed with the parental vector on galactose-containing medium, but not on glucose-containing medium (Fig. 1C). Surprisingly, the expression ofCCR4 from a multicopy plasmid had the same phenotype, but not that of CAF1 (Fig. 1C). The multicopy clone expressing CAF1 did not, however, encode full-length Caf1p, although it did encode the region necessary for interaction with Not1p, Dhh1p, and Ccr4p (9Liu H.-Y. Badarinarayana V. Audino D.C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Denis C.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1096-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 22Hata H. Mitsui H. Liu H. Bai Y. Denis C.L. Shimizu Y. Sakai A. Genetics. 1998; 148: 571-579PubMed Google Scholar) and the RNase D domain (20Daugeron M.-C. Mauxion F. Séraphin B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2448-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that cells lacking Dhh1p are particularly sensitive to alterations of the Ccr4-Not complex or to expression of specific components of the Ccr4-Not complex from multicopy plasmids. The results above could be explained if the function of Dhh1p is sensitive to modifications of Caf1p function because Caf1p is a known component of the Ccr4-Not complex and is also associated with Dhh1p. To investigate a possible more direct functional relationship between Dhh1p and the Ccr4-Not complex, we wanted to determine whether any of the mutant phenotypes associated with mutations in the NOT genes might require Dhh1p. In particular, not mutants expressing an activation-defective derivative of Gcn4p are resistant to AT. As mentioned above, this phenotype is unique to the not mutants and furthermore requires the Ccr4 and Caf1 proteins (4Maillet L. Tu C. Hong Y.K. Shuster E.O. Collart M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Bai Y. Salvadore C. Chiang Y.-C. Collart M.A. Liu H.-Y. Denis C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6642-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We thus analyzed AT resistance of single and double mutants that grew well enough to determine growth on AT plates, namely not3Δ dhh1Δ and not1-1 dhh1Δ (see Fig. 1B). These double mutants and the single mutants were transformed with a plasmid expressing the mutant Gcn4p derivative and analyzed for growth on AT. Table III shows that, first, a deletion of DHH1, like the deletion of CCR4 orCAF1, did not lead to AT resistance; and second, it completely suppressed AT resistance of not mutants.Table IIIGrowth on AT with C-163-Gen4pGenotypeAT resistanceWT−not1–1+not3Δ+ccr4Δ−caf1Δ−dhh1Δ−not1–1 ccr4Δ−not1–1 caf1Δ−not1–1 dhh1Δ−not3Δ ccr4Δ−not3Δ caf1Δ−not3Δ dhh1Δ−WT pDHH1+WT pCCR4−WT pCAF1−Growth was monitored on minimal medium lacking histidine and supplemented with 20 mm AT.

All strains are isogenic to MY1, except for the indicated allele, and carry the plasmid encoding the C-163-Gen4p derivative. pDHH1, pCCR4, and pCAF1 are multicopy plasmids carrying the indicated genes. WT, wild type. To determine whether AT resistance in not mutants might be due to increased functional levels of Dhh1p, Ccr4p, or Caf1p, we analyzed AT resistance in wild-type cells expressing each of the three proteins from multicopy plasmids. Interestingly, expression ofDHH1, but not that of either CCR4 orCAF1 (full-length in this case), from a multicopy plasmid rendered wild-type cells AT-resistant. Taken together, these results suggest that AT resistance in not mutants could be due to increased activity of Dhh1p in the context of wild-type Ccr4p and Caf1p. To address further whether Dhh1p might be associated with the Ccr4-Not complex, we determined whether a deletion of DHH1 might render cells resistant to heat shock. Indeed, in a recent study, we found that this is a phenotype shared uniformly by any mutation that affects the Ccr4-Not complex.5 Fig.2A shows that a deletion ofDHH1 rendered cells resistant to heat shock at 50 °C, as did a mutation of NOT5, and that the effects were not additive. Thus, in this case, a deletion of DHH1 has the same phenotype as a deletion of a NOT gene. By this criterion, we can expect that Dhh1p might be associated with the Ccr4-Not complex. We thus examined whether Dhh1p is physically associated with Not1p, the only known essential protein of the Ccr4-Not complex. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments using strains expressing full-length Not1p or a derivative of Not1p lacking the N-termina"

Proteins belonging to the subgroup of the HMGB proteins 2The nomenclature of the HMG proteins has been revised recently: informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/genefamilies/hmgfamily.shtml. 2The nomenclature of the HMG proteins has been revised recently: informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/genefamilies/hmgfamily.shtml. (previously termed HMG1/2 proteins (3Bustin M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 152-153Google Scholar)) have in common a distinctive DNA-binding motif, termed the HMG-box domain, in which the global fold is well conserved and consists essentially of three α-helices arranged in an L-shape (1Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1996; 54: 35-100Google Scholar, 4Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Google Scholar). The HMG-box domain mediates both non-sequence-specific binding of these proteins to the minor groove of linear DNA and high affinity interactions with distorted DNA structures such as four-way junctions, minicircles, and cis-platinated DNA (2Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Google Scholar, 4Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Google Scholar, 5Travers A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 102-109Google Scholar). In complexes with B DNA, a hydrophobic wedge on the concave surface of the HMG-box domain is inserted into the minor groove of the DNA, which contributes to the extent of DNA bending induced by the protein (5Travers A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 102-109Google Scholar). The DNA interactions of the HMG-box domains, which occur in different plant, vertebrate, insect, and yeast HMGB proteins, are modulated by basic and acidic domains flanking the DNA-binding motif (4Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Google Scholar). HMGB proteins act as architectural components in chromatin facilitating the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes, which are involved, for instance, in the regulation of transcription and recombination (2Bustin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5237-5246Google Scholar, 4Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Google Scholar). In contrast to other eukaryotes, which usually have two or three different HMGB proteins, (higher) plants contain several HMGB proteins (≥5 family members). The plant HMGB proteins have a single HMG-box domain, which is flanked by a basic N-terminal domain and an acidic C-terminal domain (6Grasser K.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 260-265Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequences of the HMG-box domains of the various plant HMGB proteins are relatively conserved, the basic and acidic flanking regions are variable in length and sequence (6Grasser K.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 260-265Google Scholar). The plant HMGB proteins differ in their chromatin association and nucleosome binding (7Lichota J. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7860-7867Google Scholar), in their expression in the plant (8Stemmer C. Grimm R. Grasser K.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 351-361Google Scholar), and in some of their DNA interactions (9Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D. Plant J. 1998; 14: 623-631Google Scholar). Therefore, they may be adapted to act in different DNA-dependent processes in the nucleus. Vertebrate HMGB proteins are subject to various post-translational modifications such as acetylation, methylation, ADP-ribosylation, and glycosylation, but relatively little is known about the functional significance of these modifications (10Einck L. Bustin M. Exp. Cell Res. 1985; 156: 295-310Google Scholar, 11van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer, Heidelberg1989Google Scholar). Insect HMGB proteins are phosphorylated by protein kinase C, inhibiting their DNA binding and nuclear translocation (12Wisniewski J.R. Schulze E. Sapetto B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 687-693Google Scholar). More recently, it was demonstrated that insect HMGB proteins are constitutively phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2, altering their conformation, stability, and DNA binding specificity (13Wisniewski J.R. Szewczuk Z. Petry I. Schwanbeck R. Renner U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20116-20122Google Scholar). Furthermore, plant CK2-type protein kinase activities were found to phosphorylate in vitro nuclear proteins from maize and broccoli that were characterized as HMG proteins by their size and solubility in 2% trichloroacetic acid (14Grasser K.D. Maier U.-G. Feix G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 456-463Google Scholar, 15Klimczak L.J. Cashmore A.R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 911-919Google Scholar). Here, we report that the maize HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 proteins, but not the HMGB4 and HMGB5 proteins, are phosphorylated by CK2 in vivoand in vitro. The phosphorylation sites have been mapped to the acidic C-terminal domains of the proteins. Phosphorylation by CK2 modulates the thermal stability of the plant HMGB proteins and alters their interactions with DNA. Maize Black Mexican Sweet (BMS) suspension culture cells were grown as described previously (8Stemmer C. Grimm R. Grasser K.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 351-361Google Scholar). Mid-log phase cells were incubated with 15 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 12 h. Cells were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and the HMG proteins were extracted using 2% trichloroacetic acid (16Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Google Scholar). The extracted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 18% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by silver staining and autoradiography. Full-length and truncated recombinant maize HMGB proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by three-step column chromatography as described previously (16Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Google Scholar, 17Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2673-2681Google Scholar). Native HMGB proteins were isolated from maize BMS cells by 2% trichloroacetic acid extraction and subsequently purified by Resource Q chromatography as described previously (16Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Google Scholar). The recombinant maize CK2α protein was expressed in E. coli using the pT7–7/BL21(DE3) system (kindly provided by Drs. B. Boldyreff and O.-G. Issinger) as described previously (18Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Dobrowolska G. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 32-38Google Scholar). The recombinant protein kinase was purified by three-step fast protein liquid column chromatography. The first chromatography was performed using heparin-agarose (Sigma) in HA buffer (0–1 m KCl in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml benzamidine), and was followed by Resource S and Resource Q (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) chromatographies, which were performed as described previously (16Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Google Scholar). The native CK2 was purified from nuclei isolated from immature maize kernels by three-step fast protein liquid column chromatography. Heparin-agarose and Resource S chromatographies were performed as described for the recombinant protein kinase, whereas casein-agarose (Sigma) was used for the final purification step in buffer CA (0–1m NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For analytical phosphorylation reactions, the different HMGB proteins (1 μm) were incubated in a total volume of 20 μl at 37 °C for 1 h with 40 ng of recombinant CK2 in the presence of 100 nCi of [γ-32P]ATP (or [γ-32P]GTP) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) in CK2 buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT). The phosphorylation reactions were monitored by separation of the proteins by SDS-PAGE in 18% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography or scanning of the gels with a Typhoon 8600 phosphorimaging device (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The scanned data were used for quantification. For preparative phosphorylation, 20 μg of the HMGB proteins were reacted with 400 ng of CK2 in the presence of 300 μm ATP in a total volume of 50 μl. The phosphorylation status of the HMGB proteins was checked by acetic acid urea-PAGE in 18% polyacrylamide gels (which resolve the HMGB proteins according to the number of phosphates incorporated into the protein) and by mass spectrometry. To ensure specific phosphorylation of the proteins, the CK2 phosphorylation reactions of the proteins used for structural and functional assays were limited so that routinely double-phosphorylated HMGB proteins were used for further analyses. All mass spectrometry analyses were performed on an ion trap LC-Q mass spectrometer (Finnigan) equipped with a nanospray source. Before measurement of the total mass of native and recombinant HMGB1 and HMGB2/3, the purified proteins were concentrated and desalted using a C18 Ziptip (Millipore). The proteins were eluted in 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% acetic acid, and directly applied in the nanospray needle. For HMGB protein dephosphorylation, native or recombinant proteins were desolved in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, and 2 units of alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) were added and incubated for 2 h at 28 °C. For tryptic digests, the HMGB proteins were dissolved in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, to which 0.5 μg of trypsin (Promega) was added. Trypsin digestion was performed at 28 °C for 3 h. One-half of the digest was acidified with acetic acid, and the other part was treated with 2 units of alkaline phosphatase for 2 h at 28 °C before the addition of acetic acid. The measurements of HMGB1 and HMGB2 at a concentration of 10 μm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were performed using a Jasco J700 instrument with a Peltier temperature controller. The temperature scans were performed in the range between 20 and 90 °C at a scan rate of 1.5°·min−1. All scans were base-line-subtracted, and the raw data were used for fitting, assuming a two-state unfolding process. Raw data were fitted to equation 1 (19Oliveberg M. Vuileumier S. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8826-8832Google Scholar) and all fittings were performed in Kaleidagraph, θ=A+B*(T−298)+(C+D*(T−298))*e−ΔHTm*1−TTm−ΔCp*Tm−T+T*lnTTmRT1+e−ΔHTm*1−TTm−ΔCp*Tm−T+T*lnTTmRTEquation 1 where Tm is the midpoint temperature of denaturation, ΔHTm is the enthalpy of denaturation at this temperature, and ΔCp is the specific heat capacity for unfolding. A and C are the ellipticities of the native and denatured states at 298 K, andB and D are the linear dependencies of these values on T. For binding studies with linear DNA, a 98-bp DNA fragment was amplified by PCR from plasmid pCB8 (20Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Google Scholar) using fluorescein-labeled primers P1 (5′-CTTTGTAGAGTGCGGGTGCT) and P2 (5′-ACAGGCCAGGGCCAGCGCTT). Various concentrations of recombinant nonphosphorylated and CK2-phosphorylated HMGB proteins were incubated in a total volume of 20 μl with 2 ng of the fluorescein-labeled DNA fragment in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Protein binding to the DNA was examined by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE buffer and scanning of the gels using a Typhoon 8600 phosphorimaging device (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at excitation 532 nm and emission 526 nm. DNA binding analyses using a mixture of32P-labeled linear and circularized 78-bp DNA fragments and various concentrations of HMGB proteins by electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (16Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Google Scholar, 17Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2673-2681Google Scholar). A comparison of the measured masses of the five maize HMGB proteins purified from immature kernels with the masses calculated from the amino acid sequences (Fig. 1A) indicated that the proteins are post-translationally modified in vivo (8Stemmer C. Grimm R. Grasser K.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 351-361Google Scholar). To analyze whether the HMGB proteins are phosphorylated in maize BMS suspension cultured cells, in vivo32P labeling of the cells was performed. Taking advantage of the acid solubility of the HMG proteins (1Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1996; 54: 35-100Google Scholar, 16Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Google Scholar), the HMGB proteins were isolated by 2% trichloroacetic acid extraction of the labeled cells. Autoradiography of the trichloroacetic acid-extracted proteins separated by SDS-PAGE revealed that predominantly two protein bands were labeled with 32P that co-migrate with the HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 proteins (Fig. 1B); this indicates that the maize HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 proteins are phosphoproteins in vivo. Because the amino acid sequences of all maize HMGB proteins contain several consensus substrate sites for protein kinase CK2, and because some plant HMG-type proteins could be phosphorylated by CK2 activities (14Grasser K.D. Maier U.-G. Feix G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 456-463Google Scholar, 15Klimczak L.J. Cashmore A.R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 911-919Google Scholar), we tested whether the purified recombinant maize HMGB proteins are substrates for purified recombinant maize CK2. Protein kinase CK2 (also known as casein kinase II) is an ubiquitous enzyme catalyzing the phosphorylation of certain Ser/Thr residues in the substrate protein (21Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 303-313Google Scholar, 22Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Google Scholar). The well characterized maize CK2α (18Boldyreff B. Meggio F. Dobrowolska G. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.-G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 32-38Google Scholar, 23Dobrowolska G. Meggio F. Szczegielniak J. Muszynska G. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 299-303Google Scholar) was expressed in E. coli and purified by three-step column chromatography. Incubation of the five maize HMGB proteins with recombinant CK2 in the presence of [32P]ATP and analysis of the proteins by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography demonstrated that CK2 can catalyze the phosphorylation of the HMGB1 protein and the two closely related HMGB2/3 proteins (89% amino acid sequence identity), but the enzyme does not phosphorylate HMGB4 and HMGB5. HMGB2 and HMGB3 are more readily phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro than HMGB1. Depending on the extent of the CK2 phosphorylation reaction, the HMGB proteins occur in the single, double, or triple phosphorylated state. 3C. Stemmer, A. Schwander, and K. D. Grasser, unpublished results. For further structural and functional studies, the double phosphorylated form of the three proteins was used. As most of the predicted CK2 consensus phosphorylation sites (as predicted by Phospho Base 2.0) 4Found on the Internet at cbs.dtu.dk/data bases/PhosphoBase/. are situated within the acidic C-terminal domain of the HMGB proteins, recombinant C-terminally truncated versions of HMGB1 (Fig. 1A) were examined in comparison with full-length HMGB1 in CK2 phosphorylation assays (Fig.1D). Compared with full-length HMGB1, the phosphorylation of HMGB1(M1-D134), which has a truncated C-terminal domain, was strongly reduced (only a very faint band was visible) and completely abolished for HMGB1(M1-K123), which lacks the acidic C-terminal domain, demonstrating that recombinant maize CK2 phosphorylates residues within this acidic domain. To examine whether the HMGB1 proteins are comparably phosphorylated by native CK2, the enzyme was purified by three-step column chromatography from immature maize kernels. The CK2 preparation isolated from maize kernels contained a protein that co-migrated in SDS-PAGE with recombinant CK2α (∼36.5 kDa) and that reacted with an antiserum raised against recombinant CK2.3 In contrast to most other protein kinases, CK2 can utilize efficiently either ATP or GTP as phosphate donors (21Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 303-313Google Scholar). We compared the ability of recombinant and native maize CK2 to use ATP and GTP in HMGB2 phosphorylation assays, demonstrating that HMGB2 was phosphorylated similarly by both CK2 preparations in presence of various concentrations of ATP or GTP (Fig.2, A and B). Another distinguishing feature of CK2 is its specific inhibition by low concentrations of heparin (21Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 303-313Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphorylation of HMGB2 by the recombinant and native maize CK2 was performed in the presence of various heparin concentrations. Both protein kinase preparations were severely inhibited by 40 and 80 ng/ml heparin, and the reaction was completely abolished by 240 ng/ml heparin (Fig. 2C). Thus, the comparable utilization of ATP and GTP as phosphate donors and the specific inhibition of the phosphorylation reaction by heparin indicate that the recombinant and native maize CK2 preparations react almost indistinguishably with the HMGB2 protein. The total masses of the HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 proteins purified from BMS cells were measured before and after treatment with alkaline phosphatase (which dephosphorylates phosphoproteins) to determine the number of phosphorylations in the native proteins. In the case of the native HMGB1 protein, the mass of the protein was reduced by 383 Da upon phosphatase treatment. Dependent on the number of Na+ ions removed during the phosphatase treatment, the number of phosphorylation sites on HMGB1 varies between three and five. Most likely, there may be four phosphorylations, as these together with three simultaneously removed Na+ ions account for a mass difference of 385 Da. In line with that, the removal of four phosphates was also observed by analysis of the dephosphorylation reaction using acetic acid urea-PAGE.3Furthermore, the measured mass of the phosphatase-treated native HMGB1 matched the calculated average mass (TableI) indicating that HMGB1 most likely contains no additional post-translational modifications. Mass determination of the protein fraction containing the closely related HMGB2 and HMGB3 proteins clearly showed the presence of three species displaying different masses. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase reduced the number of observed mass peaks to two (Table I), one with the same molecular mass as HMGB2 and the other one derived from HMGB3, with a mass 162 Da larger than the calculated average mass. The nature of this mass difference is unknown. In principle, 162 Da may correspond to the mass of a hexose but could also be the result of a combination of other modifications and/or adhesion of Na+ ions. The most likely scenario to explain the mass differences before and after alkaline phosphatase treatment (HMGB2, 238 Da; HMGB3, 237 and 157 Da) is the following. Dephosphorylation of native HMGB2 (15,556 Da) gives rise to the species with a mass of 15,318 Da corresponding to the removal of three phosphate groups. Native HMGB3 is present in two different phosphorylation states containing in part two phosphorylations (resulting in a mass of 15,326 Da) or containing three phosphate groups (resulting in a mass of 15,406 Da). The mass values determined for the native untreated HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 proteins isolated from BMS cells (Table I) are similar to those determined previously for proteins purified from immature maize kernels (8Stemmer C. Grimm R. Grasser K.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 351-361Google Scholar), indicating that the proteins are similarly modified in both tissues.Table ICalc. mass1-aThe mass values (in Da) were calculated based on the known protein sequences and in the case of the recombinant HMGB2/3 include an N-terminal 6xHis-tag (16).Untreated1-bThe masses (in Da) of native and recombinant HMGB proteins were determined by nanospray mass spectrometry on the ion trap LC-Q.CK21-bThe masses (in Da) of native and recombinant HMGB proteins were determined by nanospray mass spectrometry on the ion trap LC-Q.1-cCK2, in vitrophosphorylation of recombinant HMGB proteins by CK2.AP1-bThe masses (in Da) of native and recombinant HMGB proteins were determined by nanospray mass spectrometry on the ion trap LC-Q.1-dAP, dephosphorylation of native or recombinant HMGB proteins by treatment with alkaline phosphatase.CK2→AP1-bThe masses (in Da) of native and recombinant HMGB proteins were determined by nanospray mass spectrometry on the ion trap LC-Q.1-eCK2→AP, in vitrophosphorylation of recombinant HMGB proteins by CK2, followed by dephosphorylation using alkaline phosphatase.Mass data of recombinant HMGB proteins HMGB117,145.9ND1-fND, not determined.17,32517,17917,173 HMGB216,627.116,71916,92816,72216,714 HMGB316,318.716,40716,57816,40916,422Mass data of native HMGB proteins HMGB117,145.917,53117,148 HMGB215,315.715,55615,318 HMGB315,007.315,326 + 15,40615,1691-a The mass values (in Da) were calculated based on the known protein sequences and in the case of the recombinant HMGB2/3 include an N-terminal 6xHis-tag (16Grasser K.D.

Open table in a new tab To determine the number of sites phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro, the difference in mass between the phosphorylated recombinant HMGB proteins before and after treatment with alkaline phosphatase was analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The phosphatase treatment reduced the masses of the proteins by 152, 214, and 156 Da for HMGB1, HMGB2, and HMGB3, respectively. This finding corresponds well with the presence of two phosphorylations on each protein, which is in line with the number of phosphorylations determined by acetic acid urea gel electrophoresis.3 In the case of HMGB2 we assume that, together with the two phosphate groups, two Na+ ions were removed from the protein. The measured masses of the alkaline phosphatase-treated and the CK2-phosphorylated/alkaline phosphatase-treated recombinant HMGB1 fit well (Table I). HMGB2 and HMGB3 show mass differences of 95 and 90 Da, respectively, between the measured alkaline phosphatase-treated proteins and calculated masses. The nature of this difference is unknown but could be explained by the binding of four Na+ ions to the polypeptide chain (24Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman, New York1993Google Scholar). The HMGB proteins bind easily Na+ ions. We have recognized the tryptic C-terminal acidic peptides and other peptides as Na+ and 2 Na+ adducts in the mass spectra next to the common protonated forms. To determine the phosphorylation sites within the HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 proteins, the native proteins and the recombinant proteins phosphorylated by CK2 in vitro were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Analysis of the tryptic peptides of the CK2-phosphorylated recombinant HMGB1 demonstrated conclusively that each of the two C-terminal tryptic peptides contains a single phosphorylation. MS/MS analysis of the ion with an m/z value of 1202.2, clearly showing that Ser149 in the C-terminal peptide is phosphorylated. The same residue, Ser149, was found exclusively in the phosphorylated form in native HMGB1 (TableII). The situation for the second to last C-terminal tryptic peptide was more complicated. In the recombinant protein this peptide contains a single phosphorylation site, but the MS/MS data were inconclusive as to whether the phosphate is situated on Ser133 or on Ser136. In the trypsin digestion of the native HMGB1, this peptide was found in the double phosphorylated and single phosphorylated states as well as in the nonphosphorylated state (Fig. 3). The MS/MS data of the peptide ion with a mass of 1873 Da (m/z 936.4) contained a phosphate group on both of the Ser residues (Ser133 and Ser136). The MS/MS data of the ion with mass of 1793 Da (m/z896.5) showed that the peptide was uniquely phosphorylated on Ser133. The tryptic peptide with a mass of 1713 Da (m/z 856.5), of which none of the two Ser residues were phosphorylated, was also present in the MS spectrum of the tryptic peptides from native HMGB1. Approximately 75% of the peptide (Glu124–Lys137) occurs in the double phosphorylated form, whereas ∼12.5% is found in the nonphosphorylated and ∼12.5% in the single phosphorylated form (Fig.3). Therefore, HMGB1 is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser149 but differentially phosphorylated on Ser133 and Ser136 (Table II). The in vitro phosphorylation experiment (Fig. 1D) with the C-terminally truncated HMGB1(M1-D134) protein is in agreement with this finding. HMGB1(M1-D134) lacks the region containing Ser136and Ser149 and is phosphorylated only extremely weakly by CK2 (compared with the full-length protein), and the phosphorylation is completely abolished for HMGB1(M1-K123).Table IISequence data determined by MS/MS of the peptides phosphorylated by CK2 in HMGB1Protein2-ar and n indicate whether recombinant or native HMGB1, respectively, was analyzed.PeptideIon2-bAll ions were double charged.Sequence2-cThe phosphorylation values of specific Ser residues and of peptides are indicated by (pS), whereas Na+ adducts are indicated by Na.m/zrHMGB1Ser138– Glu1571202.2[SEVNDEDDEEG(pS)EEDEDDDE]NarHMGB1Glu124–Lys137896.5[EEEEEDEEESDKSK]pnHMGB1Ser138–Glu1571202.2[SEVNDEDDEEG(pS)EEDEDDDE]NanHMGB1Glu124–Lys137856.5EEEEEDEEESDKSKnHMGB1Glu124–Lys137896.5EEEEEDEEE(pS)DKSKnHMGB1Glu124–Lys137936.4EEEEEDEEE(pS)DK(pS)K2-a r and n indicate whether recombinant or native HMGB1, respectively, was analyzed.2-b All ions were double charged.2-c The phosphorylation values of specific Ser residues and of peptides are indicated by (pS), whereas Na+ adducts are indicated by Na. Open table in a new tab The analysis of the tryptic peptides derived from native and in vitro CK2-phosphorylated HMGB2 and HMGB3 revealed that the two C-terminal tryptic peptides were phosphorylated. We could not determine exactly the number and location of the phosphate groups in the amino acid sequences of these peptides, as we were unable to detect the phosphorylated peptides in the mass spectrum, which may be due to ion suppression (25Ogueta S. Rogado R. Marina A. Moreno F. Redondo J.M. Vazquez J. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 556-565Google Scholar, 26Sickmann A. Marcus K. Schäfer H. Butt-Dörje E. Lejr S. Herkner A. Suer S. Bahr I. Meyer H.E. Electrophoresis. 2001; 22: 1669-1676Google Scholar) or to the fact that these peptides have a negative charge. Alkaline phosphatase treatment of the phosphorylated tryptic peptides, however, resulted in the appearance of the two C-terminal nonphosphorylated tryptic peptides in the mass spectrum, which were absent in the original mass spectrum of the untreated sample. This fact indicates that the two C-terminal peptides of both proteins are phosphorylated. Therefore, the 2–3 phosphorylations of HMGB2/3 (see above) may occur on five candidate residues for HMGB2 (Thr114, Ser120, Ser122, Ser130, Ser131) and on four candidate residues for HMGB3 (Thr113, Ser119, Ser121, Ser130), as indicated in Fig.1A. To examine whether CK2 phosphorylation alters the stability of the HMGB proteins, the thermal denaturation of the proteins was followed by CD at 222 nm, because the HMG-box domain is largely α-helical. The temperature scans for nonphosphorylated and in vitro CK2-phosphorylated HMGB1 and HMGB2 revealed that the phosphorylated proteins exhibited increased melting temperatures (Fig. 4). The melting profiles for the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated proteins are shifted toward higher melting temperatures according to their increased thermostability. The observed melting temperatures were 48.3 and 50.3 °C for nonphosphorylated HMGB1 and HMGB2, respectively, and 52.4 and 51.6 °C for phosphorylated HMGB1 and HMGB2, respectively. Although there was only an insignificant rise (1.3 °C) in the thermal stability of HMGB2, a marked phosphorylation-induced increase (4.1 °C) in the melting temperature was observed in the case of HMGB1. The interaction of nonphosphorylated and in vitroCK2-phosphorylated HMGB1 and HMGB2 with linear DNA was compared to test whether the phosphorylation alters the DNA binding properties of the proteins. Increasing concentrations of the HMGB proteins were incubated with a 98-bp fragment, and the formation of complexes was monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig.5A). As the plant HMGB proteins do not form specific complexes with linear DNA (16Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Google Scholar), protein binding to the DNA can be seen best as the disappearance of the DNA band corresponding to the unbound fragment. With both proteins the phosphorylation resulted in a reduced affinity for the linear DNA, because (compared with the nonphosphorylated proteins) higher concentrations of phosphorylated HMGB1 and HMGB2 are required to detect DNA binding. DNA minicircles are high affinity binding sites for HMGB proteins of various sources (4Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Google Scholar, 5Travers A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 102-109Google Scholar, 6Grasser K.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 260-265Google Scholar). The minicircles are bound structure specifically, because HMGB proteins display a marked preference for the minicircle over the corresponding linear DNA. The interaction of nonphosphorylated and in vitro CK2-phosphorylated HMGB1 and HMGB2 with a 32P-labeled 78-bp DNA minicircle was examined in the presence of the corresponding linear 78-bp fragment using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In the tested protein concentration range, both proteins bound the minicircular but not the linear fragment (Fig. 5B). The HMGB proteins bind the linear DNA only when the preferred binding sites on the minicircles are occupied by the proteins (16Grasser K.D. Grimm R. Ritt C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32900-32906Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the proteins has no significant influence on the recognition of the structure of the minicircle. However, at higher concentrations (500 nm, 1 μm) the nonphosphorylated HMGB1 and HMGB2 form a third complex with the minicircle, which is not formed by the phosphorylated proteins. Mass spectrometric analyses of HMGB proteins purified from immature maize kernels have previously indicated that the HMGB proteins are subject to post-translational modifications (8Stemmer C. Grimm R. Grasser K.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 351-361Google Scholar). In this report, we show by in vivo 32P labeling that HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 are phosphorylated in BMS cells. HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 but not HMGB4 and HMGB5 are phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant (Fig. 1C) and native3 maize protein kinase CK2, although all five proteins theoretically contain CK2 phosphorylation sites. Moreover, the CK2 phosphorylation sites predicted for HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 are only to a certain extent in agreement with our experimental results obtained with native HMGB proteins. The minimal consensus consists of an acidic or phosphorylated residue at position +3 relative to the phosphorylation site, but efficient phosphorylation by CK2 requires the presence of clusters of acidic residues around the phosphorylation site (21Guerra B. Boldyreff B. Sarno S. Cesaro L. Issinger O.-G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 82: 303-313Google Scholar, 22Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Google Scholar). These requirements are fulfilled for all the CK2 phosphorylation sites determined in the maize HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 proteins (Fig. 1A) except for Ser133 in HMGB1. Ser133 is phosphorylated although Ser136 (the residue +3 relative to Ser133) is not previously phosphorylated by CK2, because in the single phosphorylated tryptic peptide Glu124–Lys137 it is clearly Ser133that is phosphorylated (Fig. 3 and Table II). In the case of Ser133, the acidic residue at position +1 (Asp134) together with the acidic cluster upstream of the phosphorylation site probably can substitute for the usually critical acidic or phosphorylated residue at position +3 (22Pinna L.A. Ruzzene M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1314: 191-225Google Scholar). The HMGB1 and HMGB2/3 proteins, but not the HMGB4 and HMGB5 proteins, are phosphorylated by CK2 within their acidic C-terminal domains. In the HMGB1 protein isolated from BMS cells, amino acid residue Ser149 is phosphorylated constitutively, whereas Ser133 and Ser136 are differentially phosphorylated (Table II). In the case of the insect HMGB proteins derived from Chironomus and Drosophila, the tested HMGB proteins are essentially phosphorylated constitutively at two or three residues within their acidic C-terminal domains (13Wisniewski J.R. Szewczuk Z. Petry I. Schwanbeck R. Renner U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20116-20122Google Scholar). By contrast, it is unlikely that the vertebrate HMGB proteins are substrates for CK2 phosphorylation, as the acidic C-terminal domain of these proteins consists mainly of a consecutive stretch of aspartate and glutamate residues (1Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1996; 54: 35-100Google Scholar) lacking canonical CK2 phosphorylation sites. In the case of the maize HMGB1, it is likely that, in addition to CK2, another so far unidentified protein kinase contributes to the phosphorylation of HMGB1 in vivo because HMGB1 isolated from BMS cells contains four phosphate groups, but only three residues are phosphorylated by CK2. The thermal denaturation experiments with the nonphosphorylated HMGB proteins demonstrated that HMGB2 has a slightly higher thermostability than HMGB1. CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the two proteins induced an increase in thermostability (4.1 and 1.3 °C for HMGB1 and HMGB2, respectively), which was more prominent with HMGB1. This marked increase in Tm of phosphorylated HMGB1 resulted in a slightly higher stability of phosphorylated HMGB1 compared with that of phosphorylated HMGB2. The relatively high thermostability of phosphorylated HMGB1 is in agreement with the finding that HMGB1 is the metabolically most stable maize HMGB protein in BMS cells (8Stemmer C. Grimm R. Grasser K.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 351-361Google Scholar). In line with our results, fluorescence studies of a HMGB protein from Chironomus have revealed that the CK2-phosphorylated protein exhibits a melting temperature that was 2.4 °C higher than that of the nonphosphorylated protein (13Wisniewski J.R. Szewczuk Z. Petry I. Schwanbeck R. Renner U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20116-20122Google Scholar). Depending on the DNA substrate, the acidic C-terminal domain can severely influence the DNA binding of animal and plant HMGB proteins. Although the acidic tail reduces the affinity of HMGB proteins for linear and supercoiled DNA and for four-way junction DNA, it has only relatively little effect on the affinity for DNA minicircles (17Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2673-2681Google Scholar,27Lee K.-B. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 135-149Google Scholar, 28Payet D. Travers A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 66-75Google Scholar, 29Sheflin L.G. Fucile N.W. Spaulding S.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3238-3248Google Scholar, 30Stros M. Stokrova J. Thomas J.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1044-1051Google Scholar, 31Wisniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Google Scholar, 32Yoshida K. Saito K. Tanabe T. Yamamoto A. Ando Y. Nakamura Y. Shirakawa H. Yoshida M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 589-595Google Scholar). The reduced affinity of maize HMGB1 and HMGB2 phosphorylated by CK2 for linear DNA (Fig. 5A) is in line with the findings that DNA affinity of HMGB proteins is decreased by an increase in the length of the acidic tail, which correlates with a higher number of negative charges (17Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2673-2681Google Scholar, 27Lee K.-B. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 135-149Google Scholar, 31Wisniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the acidic domain of a HMGB protein from Chironomus by CK2 significantly reduced the affinity of the protein for four-way junction DNA, whereas it had no effect on the interaction with linear DNA (13Wisniewski J.R. Szewczuk Z. Petry I. Schwanbeck R. Renner U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20116-20122Google Scholar). The fact that the affinity of plant HMGB proteins for linear DNA is reduced by phosphorylation of the acidic tail could be explained by stronger intramolecular interactions of the acidic region presumably with the basic N-terminal domain (6Grasser K.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 260-265Google Scholar). This basic N-terminal domain (typical for plant and yeast HMGB proteins) enhances the binding to linear DNA (17Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2673-2681Google Scholar,33Yen Y.-M. Wong B. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4424-4435Google Scholar); and insect HMGB proteins lack this domain, which may explain the different effect of CK2 phosphorylation of the acidic tail on the affinity of insect and plant HMGB proteins for linear DNA. CK2-mediated phosphorylation of maize HMGB1 and HMGB2 had no marked effect on the affinity of the proteins for DNA minicircles (Fig. 5B), but the phosphorylated proteins formed only two complexes with the minicircle, whereas the nonphosphorylated proteins formed three complexes in the same range of protein concentration. Because the acidic tail is involved in the oligomerization of the maize HMGB1 protein in the presence of DNA (17Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2673-2681Google Scholar), it is possible that phosphorylation of the acidic domain modulates the cooperativity of the binding to the minicircles, which may be critical for minicircle binding (34Webb M. Payet D. Lee K.-B. Travers A.A. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 79-88Google Scholar). In contrast to other eukaryotes, which usually contain two or three HMGB proteins, five different HMGB proteins have been identified in maize and Arabidopsis. Moreover, the plant HMGB proteins are structurally more variable than mammalian, insect, and yeast HMGB proteins, both in size and in primary structure (6Grasser K.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 260-265Google Scholar). They display different expression levels in the plant, are differently associated with chromatin, and exhibit differences in some of their DNA interactions (7Lichota J. Grasser K.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7860-7867Google Scholar, 8Stemmer C. Grimm R. Grasser K.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 351-361Google Scholar, 9Ritt C. Grimm R. Fernández S. Alonso J.C. Grasser K.D. Plant J. 1998; 14: 623-631Google Scholar). Therefore, the different plant HMGB proteins might have been adapted to act as accessory factors in a variety of specific nucleoprotein structures (6Grasser K.D. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 260-265Google Scholar). The differential phosphorylation by CK2 further increases the number of HMGB variants occurring in plants, which display subtle differences in their DNA interactions and/or their protein/protein contacts, making these proteins even more versatile architectural chromatin-associated factors. In plants, CK2 phosphorylates a wide variety of substrate proteins and is involved in the regulation of various developmental programs such as circadian rhythm, control of light- and salicylic acid-induced gene expression, and plant growth (35Hidalgo P. Garretón V. Berrı́os C.G. Ojeda H. Jordana X. Holuigue L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 396-405Google Scholar, 36Lee Y. Lloyd A.M. Roux S.J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 989-1000Google Scholar, 37Sugano S. Andronis C. Ong M.S. Green R.M. Tobin E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12362-12366Google Scholar). It will be interesting to examine whether the phosphorylation of HMGB proteins catalyzed by CK2 plays a role in these processes and how the recently identified maize CK2 subtypes (38Riera M. Peracchia G. Nadal E. Ariño J. Pagès M. Plant J. 2001; 25: 365-374Google Scholar) are involved in that. We thank Dr. W. Bessler for preparation of the CK2 antiserum, Drs. B. Boldyreff and O.-G. Issinger for the maize CK2α expression plasmid, and Dr. D. Otzen for comments on the manuscript."

This report identifies sea urchin sperm receptor for egg jelly-3 (suREJ3) as a new member of the polycystin-1 family (the protein mutated in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease). suREJ3 is a multidomain, 2,681-amino acid, heavily glycosylated orphan receptor with 11 putative transmembrane segments (TMS) that localize to the plasma membrane covering the sperm acrosomal vesicle.

Upon contact with the jelly layer surrounding the egg, sea urchin sperm undergo the exocytotic acrosome reaction (AR).1 The AR involves Na+ and Ca2+ influx and H+ and K+ efflux. This results in increases in intracellular Ca2+ and pH values and elevation of cAMP and inositol triphosphate (1Darszon A. Labarca P. Nishigaki T. Espinosa F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 481-510Google Scholar). In sea urchin sperm, suREJ1 was identified as a 1,450-amino acid type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is involved in the signaling cascade leading to the AR (2Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar). suREJ1 binds to the fucose sulfate polymer of egg jelly, and the isolated polymer is capable of inducing the acrosome reaction in a manner similar to whole egg jelly (3Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar, 4Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourão P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of suREJ1 identified several extracellular domains including an epidermal growth factor domain, two carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), and the REJ module, a region of ∼1,000 amino acids that is homologous to only one other protein, polycystin-1 (2Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar). Polycystin-1 is a multidomain glycoprotein of 4,303 amino acids with 11 putative TMS (5Consortium T.E.P.K.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 881-894Google Scholar). The last six TMS are homologous to polycystin-2 and to voltage-activated calcium channels (6Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi S. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A.

Chissoe S. Pepin K. Bateman A. Chothia C. Hughes J. Harris P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1483-1489Google Scholar). Human polycystin-2 is a 968-amino acid protein with six putative TMS (6Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi S. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J.M. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Google Scholar). Mutations in the human polycystin-1 gene account for ∼85% of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, whereas mutations in the polycystin-2 gene account for ∼15% of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. This disease affects an estimated 1 in 400 to 1 in 1,000 individuals and is one of the most common hereditary disorders. All autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients have renal cysts, and other manifestations include pancreatic and hepatic cysts and cardiovascular abnormalities (8Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1861-1866Google Scholar, 9Calvet J.P. Grantham J.J. Semin. Nephrol. 2001; 21: 107-123Google Scholar). Along with sequence homology to voltage-gated ion channels and transient receptor potential channels, there is accumulating functional evidence that mammalian polycystin-1 and -2 interact to form a calcium-modulated nonselective cation channel (10Chen X.-Z. Vassilev P.M. Basora N. Peng J.-B. Nomura H. Segal Y. Brown E.M. Reeders S.T. Hediger M.A. Zhou J. Nature. 1999; 401: 383-386Google Scholar, 11Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K.

Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Google Scholar). Several homologs of both polycystin-1 and -2 have been reported in mammals, fish, and invertebrates (7Sandford R. Sgotto B. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Vaudin M. Wilson R.K. Chissoe S. Pepin K. Bateman A. Chothia C. Hughes J. Harris P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1483-1489Google Scholar, 13Barr M.M. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 386-389Google Scholar, 14Barr M.M. DeModena J. Braun D. Nguyen C.Q. Hall D.H. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1341-1346Google Scholar), demonstrating that these proteins are a new gene family whose function remains ill-defined. Recently, another human polycystin-1 homolog, hPKDREJ, has been identified. This homolog contains the ∼1,000-residue REJ module plus the COOH-terminal 11 TMS of polycystin-1 (15Hughes J. Ward C.J. Aspinwall R. Butler R. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 543-549Google Scholar). Most interestingly, hPKDREJ is only expressed in testis, and transcripts first appear during sperm differentiation. The homology between the sea urchin sperm suREJ proteins and mammalian hPKDREJ suggests that both animal groups may share a common signaling pathway in fertilization. While screening a sea urchin testis cDNA library with suREJ1 probes, two new homologs were discovered, suREJ2 and suREJ3. Of these, suREJ3 is unique in that it contains all 11 TMS found in mammalian polycystin-1 (5Consortium T.E.P.K.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 881-894Google Scholar) and hPKDREJ (15Hughes J. Ward C.J. Aspinwall R. Butler R. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 543-549Google Scholar). A suREJ1 clone isolated from a Lambda ZAP cDNA library of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus testis (2Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar) was used for screening. Overlapping clones of suREJ3 were obtained and sequenced. After repeated rounds of screening with suREJ3 specific probes, the full-length sequence was obtained and both ends confirmed by rescreening the cDNA library. suREJ3 homologs were identified using BLAST (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar). Specific domains and glycosylation sites were found using the ProfileScan web site www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/software/PFSCAN_form.html and the PredictProtein web site dodo.cpmc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/predictprotein.html. The signal sequence was predicted using the SignalP web site (17Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Google Scholar). Random jumble analysis was performed using the Biology Workbench web site PRSS program biowb.sdsc.edu/CGI/BW.cgi. ClustalX and ClustalW were used to make multiple sequence alignments (18Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 383-402Google Scholar), and shading was done using BoxShade www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html. Percent identity and percent similarity (includes identical and conserved amino acid changes) were calculated using the program GeneDoc (19Nicholas K.B. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Deerfield II, D.W. EMBNEW News. 1997; 4: 14Google Scholar). TMS were predicted using hydropathy plots that were generated by the method of Kyte and Doolittle with a window of 14 amino acids (20Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Google Scholar). GenBankTM accession numbers used are as follows: suREJ3,AF422153; human polycystin-1, P98161; human polycystin-2, Q13563; hPKDREJ, XP_010050; rat latrophilin-1, T14324; Anthocidaris crassispina SUEL, P22031; human flamingo-1, AAG00080; and human CD97, AAB36682. Recombinant proteins were made by amplifying DNA with exact match primers that correspond to the following amino acids: Glu32 to Lys241, SUEL/CRD; His1757 to Pro2039, IH. The forward and reverse primers contained the restriction sites NdeI andBamHI. The amplified DNA was digested with restriction enzymes and ligated into the expression vector pET15b (Novagen), which contains an NH2-terminal His tag. The vector was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen), the protein expressed by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) induction, and purified using Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen). Two milligrams of the purified protein was separated on SDS-PAGE and visualized by cupric chloride staining (21Lee C. Levin A. Branton D. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 308-312Google Scholar). The acrylamide-embedded protein was used for antibody production. For SUEL/CRD (S/C), chicken antibodies were raised commercially (Cocalico, Reamstown, PA) and initially purified from egg yolks as described (22Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Weiser T. Hübscher U. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2528-2532Google Scholar). Antibodies were further affinity-purified on an S/C-conjugated Affi-Gel-10 column (Bio-Rad). Anti-IH rabbit antibodies were raised commercially (Strategic BioSolutions, Ramona, CA) and affinity-purified on an IH-conjugated Affi-Gel-10 column. (Dr. Charles G. Glabe generously provided the peptide.) Cys-Phe219-Ile-Asn-Leu-Thr-His-Gly-Gln-Trp-Ser-Trp-Arg-Asp-Cys-Glu-Asn-Arg235was used to generate the R3p antibody. The peptide was attached to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) and rabbit antibodies raised commercially (Cocalico). The resulting R3p antibody was purified using the peptide conjugated to Sulfo-Link (Pierce). All procedures were on ice or at 4 °C. Sea urchins were spawned by injection with 0.5 mKCl, and the undiluted sperm was collected with a Pasteur pipette. The sperm was resuspended in 0.45 μm filtered seawater (FSW). Coelomocytes were removed by three 5-min centrifugations at 200 ×g, and sperm cells were sedimented at 5,000 ×g. For isolation of sperm heads and flagella, undiluted sperm was resuspended in 20 volumes of FSW containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7 and 50 mm KCl to block the AR. Resuspended sperm were homogenized with a Teflon glass homogenizer to break flagella from heads. The flagella and heads were separated by differential centrifugation for 10 min (800 × g for heads and 5,000 × g for flagella). Separation procedures were repeated until the samples were maximally enriched for heads or flagella, as determined by phase contrast microscopy. Whole sperm, heads, and flagella were resuspended in membrane solubilization buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4). For immunoprecipitation, 0.5% w/v of Zwittergent 3-10 was used instead of Nonidet P-40. Solubilized protein was obtained after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h (4 °C). Sperm membrane vesicles were made according to the pH 9 method (23Vacquier V.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1986; 27: 15-40Google Scholar). For wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) chromatography, solubilized sperm protein was applied to a WGA-agarose column (EY Laboratories). The column was washed with wash buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4), and the protein eluted in wash buffer containing 100 mmN-acetyl-d-glucosamine. SDS-PAGE was performed (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and gels were stained with silver (25Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Google Scholar) or Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For protein-N-glycosidase-F (PNGase-F) treatment of sperm protein, 40 μg of WGA eluate containing 0.5% SDS and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol was boiled for 5 min. Nonidet P-40 was added to 7.5%, followed by 2.4 μl of PNGase-F and 27.6 μl of distilled water. The sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Following deglycosylation, the sample was separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF. Western blots were then performed using S/C and IH antibodies. 2–10 μg of affinity-purified IH antibody was incubated on ice overnight with 1 mg of Zwittergent 3-10 solubilized sperm protein in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Twenty microliters of prewashed Pansorbin (Calbiochem) was added, and the samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The Pansorbin was sedimented at 12,000 × g for 1 min. Supernatants were then removed, and the Pansorbin was washed three times (5 min each) with solubilization buffer. The samples were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were probed with S/C and IH antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Calbiochem). Membranes were detected with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Freshly spawned sperm were diluted 1:100 and incubated 10 min in FSW containing 3% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Fixed cells were washed three times for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Permeabilized sperm were incubated for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and were then washed three times. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, and were then incubated for 1 h with primary antibody in a blocking solution. This was followed by three 10-min washes, a 1-h incubation in Alexafluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), and three additional washes. The deduced amino acid sequence of suREJ3 reveals a 2,681-amino acid multidomain protein (Fig.1). Based on Met-1 as the start site and following the 27-residue signal sequence, the presumed mature protein begins at Gly28. From the NH2 to COOH terminus, suREJ3 contains the following domains: an 84-residue sea urchin egg lectin domain (SUEL, Ref. 26Ozeki Y. Matsui T. Masami S. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2391-2394Google Scholar), a 117-residue CRD (27Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Google Scholar), a 55-residue PKD repeat (5Consortium T.E.P.K.D.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 297-308Google Scholar), a 37-residue G-protein-coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS, Ref. 29Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R585-588Google Scholar), TMS 1, a 124-polycystin/lipoxygenase/alpha-toxin domain (PLAT, Refs. 29Ponting C.P. Hofmann K. Bork P. Curr.

The REJ module found in suREJ1 and polycystin-1 family members extends from Arg539 to Lys1476(Fig. 1, vertical lines; 2). The extracellular portion of the 1,485 residues preceding TMS 1 contains 23 potentialN-linked glycosylation sites, and the region between TMS 1 and 11 contains eight such sites (asterisks). suREJ3 contains several domains found in polycystin-1 and hPKDREJ, as well as domains unique to suREJ3 among the polycystin family members (Fig.2).Figure 2The domain structure of suREJ3, suREJ1, polycystin-1 and -2. The key defines each domain. TMS are numbered above suREJ3. suREJ3, polycystin-1, and PKDREJ are homologous to polycystin-2 in the region with the last 6 TMS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The SUEL domain was originally described as a galactose-binding sea urchin egg lectin (26Ozeki Y. Matsui T. Masami S. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2391-2394Google Scholar). SUEL domains are also found in fish eggs (31Tateno H. Saneyoshi A. Ogawa T. Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Saneyoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19190-19197Google Scholar,32Hosono M. Ishikawa K. Mineki R. Murayama K. Numata C. Ogawa Y. Takayanagi Y. Nitta K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1472: 668-675Google Scholar), and latrophilins, members of the secretin family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, Ref. 33Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Google Scholar). The SUEL domain of suREJ3 is 44–48% similar to the SUEL domain from the mammalian latrophilins. The suREJ3 CRD is a C-type lectin domain containing the six diagnostic Cys residues (27Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Google Scholar). Its specificity for carbohydrate binding is unknown. suREJ3 contains a region of 55 amino acids that have distant homology to 16 repeat sequences present in polycystin-1, called PKD repeats. A multiple sequence alignment with the 16 repeats from human polycystin-1 and suREJ3 shows 16–26% similarity; the human PKD repeats are 20–30% similar to each other. A random jumble analysis shows that the relationship is statistically significant. suREJ3, polycystin-1, and hPKDREJ all possess a REJ module of ∼1000 amino acids of unknown function. suREJ3 contains a PLAT domain between TMS 1 and 2, which is also present in polycystin-1 and hPKDREJ. The PLAT domain is homologous to the NH2-terminal β-barrel domain of lipoxygenases (34Gillmor S.A. Villaseñor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1009Google Scholar), enzymes that peroxidize lipids (35Kuhn H. Thiele B.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 7-11Google Scholar). Of the lipoxygenases, the suREJ3 domain is most closely related to the NH2-terminal domain of mammalian 5-lipoxygenase (48% similar). Prior to the first TMS is the GPS domain. This domain is present in several members of the secretin family of GPCRs, including latrophilins (33Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Google Scholar). Three members, latrophilin-1, hFlamingo-1, and CD97 are known to be proteolytically processed, with cleavage between the Leu and Thr residues of latrophilin-1 (Fig. 3, Refs. 36Usui T. Shima Y.

Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Google Scholar). If suREJ3 was cleaved at the GPS domain, the unglycosylated NH2 portion of 1,455 amino acids would be ∼160 kDa and the COOH portion would be ∼140 kDa. Sperm membrane proteins were solubilized in Nonidet P-40, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. Immunoblots were then performed. An antibody to the S/C in the NH2-terminal region reacted with a single component at ∼250 kDa, whereas the IH antibody to the internal loop between TMS 3 and 4 reacted with a single band at ∼150 kDa (Fig.4A). Digestion of the preparation with PNGase-F resulted in electrophoretic mobility shifts of the S/C-reacting band to ∼180 kDa and the IH-reacting band to ∼140 kDa (Fig. 4B). The most likely explanation for these results is that, like the GPCRs, suREJ3 is cleaved into approximately equal halves at the GPS domain, the NH2-terminal portion being heavily glycosylated. Association of the two halves of suREJ3 with each other was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of both proteins from Zwittergent 3-10 extracts of sperm using the IH antibody (Fig.5). Like suREJ1, the NH2terminus of suREJ3 can be partially removed from the membrane by incubating sperm in pH 9.2 FSW (23Vacquier V.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1986; 27: 15-40Google Scholar), whereas the COOH terminus is exclusively associated with the membrane fraction (Fig. 7). This indicates that the interaction between the NH2 and COOH termini is not because of disulfide bonds, but rather because the interaction is noncovalent.Figure 4Immunoblots with suREJ3 antibodies.A, immunoblot of Nonidet P-40 solubilized total sperm protein identifying the NH2 terminus (S/C) and COOH terminus (IH) of suREJ3.

IH antibody (+) was used for immunoprecipitation with 2 mg of Zwittergent 3-10 solubilized protein from isolated sperm heads. The washed Pansorbin containing the attached antibody/antigen complex was boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. The supernatant was separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membrane. The blots were probed with either the S/C or IH antibodies. Control immunoprecipitates with no IH antibody (−) did not bind either half of suREJ3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Immunoblots of isolated sperm heads and flagella membrane fractions. Sperm heads and flagella were separated and resuspended in pH 9.2 FSW. The high pH causes the plasma membrane to bud off the cell component as tightly sealed vesicles (23Vacquier V.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1986; 27: 15-40Google Scholar). After removing the cellular debris by two 30-min centrifugations at 6,000 × g, the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet-containing sperm membrane vesicles and the supernatant were separated on gels and transferred to PVDF membrane. Probing the blots with anti-S/C antibody showed that the NH2-terminal half of suREJ3 was in both the head supernatant (Hs) and head vesicle fraction (Hv). The flagellar fraction did not react with this antibody (Fs, Fv). The IH antibody to the COOH-terminal half of suREJ3 reacted only with the sperm head vesicle preparation (Hv). Five micrograms of protein were loaded per lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunofluorescence on whole sperm using Fab fragments of rabbit anti-R3p and rabbit anti-IH IgG show that both halves of suREJ3 co-localize exclusively to the acrosomal vesicle region of sperm (Fig. 6). Reaction with IH antibody occurred only after treatment of the fixed sperm with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, supporting the putative intracellular location of the IH antigen. The exclusive localization to sperm heads was supported by Western blots showing that suREJ3 antigens are present in sperm heads, but not sperm flagella (Fig. 7). The extracellular portion of suREJ3 contains three domains: SUEL, CRD, and the PKD repeat, all of which indicate a role in extracellular matrix interactions. The SUEL domain and CRD suggest a lectin-like interaction with carbohydrates, presumably from the multicomponent egg extracellular matrix known as egg jelly (3Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar). We do not know the identity of possible ligands binding these three domains. The SUEL domain was first identified as an α-d-galactose-specific lectin in eggs of the sea urchin A. crassispina (26Ozeki Y. Matsui T. Masami S. Titani K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2391-2394Google Scholar). SUEL is a 105-amino acid protein that forms a homodimer that localizes to the egg cortex after fertilization. SUEL binding is calcium-independent and does not require reduction. The mammalian orphan GPCRs, known as latrophilins, also contain SUEL domains. Latrophilin-1 binds α-latrotoxin (black widow spider toxin) in a calcium-independent manner, resulting in massive exocytotic release of neurotransmitter (40Davletov B.A. Shamotienko O.G. Lelianova V.G. Grishin E.V. Ushkaryov Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23239-23245Google Scholar). Comparison of rat and bovine latrophilins shows that the SUEL domain is the most conserved part of the protein, suggesting that it is important in latrophilin signaling (41Matsushita H. Lelianova V.G. Ushkaryov Y.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 348-352Google Scholar). Although G-protein subunits have been found in sea urchin spermatozoa, there is no evidence that they are involved in triggering the AR (42Cuellar-Mata P. Martinez-Cadena G. Castellano L.E. Aldana-Veloz G. Novoa-Martinez G. Vargas I. Darszon A. Garcia-Soto J. Dev. Growth Differ. 1995; 37: 173-181Google Scholar). The single CRD of suREJ3 has the diagnostic structure of a calcium-dependent lectin (27Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Google Scholar). suREJ1 has two NH2-terminal-located CRDs, which are only 50% identical to each other over an alignment of 120 residues (21Lee C. Levin A. Branton D. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 308-312Google Scholar). The single CRD of suREJ3 is 52% identical to CRD-1 of suREJ1 and 47% identical to the suREJ1 CRD-2. The sequences of these CRDs do not disclose their sugar binding specificity. suREJ3 has only one PKD repeat, whereas human polycystin-1 has 16. PKD repeats are not found in Lov-1, theCaenorhabditis elegans homolog of polycystin-1 (13Barr M.M. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 386-389Google Scholar, 14Barr M.M. DeModena J. Braun D. Nguyen C.Q. Hall D.H. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1341-1346Google Scholar). The most likely explanation is that duplication of PKD repeats occurred in the evolution of the vertebrates on the way to mammals. NMR studies show the PKD repeat has a β-sandwich fold, similar to the immunoglobulin fold, but it is evolutionarily unrelated to IgG molecules (28Bycroft M. Bateman A. Clarke J. Hamill S.J. Sandford R. Thomas R.L. Chothia C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 297-308Google Scholar). The PKD repeats from polycystin-1 mediate both cis- (on the same cell) and trans- (cell-to-cell) calcium-dependent, homotypic interactions (43Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Bukanov N.O. Donohue L.C. Dackowski W.R. Klinger K.W. Landes G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1641-1649Google Scholar). The aforementioned data suggest that the single PKD repeat of suREJ3 could act in homotypic clustering of the protein in the acrosomal region. The REJ module was originally described as a domain of 707 amino acids found in suREJ1 and human polycystin-1 (2Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar). The addition of other polycystin-1 homologs to the data base showed that the REJ module was ∼1,000 amino acids (7Sandford R. Sgotto B. Aparicio S. Brenner S. Vaudin M. Wilson R.K. Chissoe S. Pepin K. Bateman A. Chothia C. Hughes J. Harris P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1483-1489Google Scholar). This domain also occurs in the mammalian testis-specific PKDREJ. The GPS cleavage site is within this domain in suREJ3. The REJ module is not found in the secretin family of GPCRs, which have the GPS domain; therefore, possession of the REJ module is independent of possession of a GPS site. Because the GPS site is known to be extracellular, and PLAT is exclusively intracellular, the positions of these two domains support the topology presented herein for the TMS of suREJ3. Also, the IH antibody to the putative intracellular sequence between TMS 3 and 4 binds only to the acrosomal regions in sperm that have been detergent permeabilized. Among the secretin family of GPCRs, latrophilins are unique in their relationship to suREJ3, because they contain both the SUEL and GPS domains. This report demonstrates that suREJ3 is cleaved and that the deglycosylated halves correspond to their predicted sizes based on cleavage at the GPS domain. Although we do not experimentally show the exact point of cleavage of suREJ3, based on work with other GPS-containing proteins, we believe that suREJ3 is cleaved at the consensus Leu-Thr site (Fig. 2). This is the first evidence that a polycystin-1-like protein is cleaved. The presence of this domain in suREJ1 may also explain the previous observation that 70% of suREJ1 can be removed from sperm by treatment with pH 9.2 seawater for 5 h (2Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar). Whether mammalian polycystin-1 and hPKDREJ are also cleaved at the GPS domain remains to be demonstrated. The two halves of suREJ3, although associated in detergent extracts of sperm membranes (Fig. 5), are not as tenaciously associated as are the two halves of latrophilin-1. Unlike latrophilin-1, the two halves of suREJ3 dissociate in SDS-mercaptoethanol sample buffer without the addition of 8 m urea (39Krasnoperov V.G. Bittner M.A. Beavis R. Kuang Y. Salnikow K.V. Chepurny O.G. Little A.R. Plotnikov A.N. Wu D. Holz R.W. Petrenko A.G. Neuron. 1997; 18: 925-937Google Scholar). Also, like suREJ1, the NH2-terminal half of suREJ3 can be partially removed from sperm by treatment with pH 9.2 seawater, showing that it is a peripheral component of the cell membrane. The relationship between suREJ3 and latrophilins and the location of suREJ3 over the acrosomal vesicle suggests that suREJ3 may regulate AR exocytosis. α-Latrotoxin does not induce the AR of sea urchin sperm (data not shown). This is not surprising, because black widow spider toxins show phylogenetic specificity (44Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Google Scholar). Also, recent work suggests that α-latrotoxin does not activate latrophilin-1 to cause exocytosis, but instead functions by tethering to latrophilin-1 and inserting itself into the membrane to form pores (45Hlubek M.D. Stuenkel E.L. Krasnoperov V.G. Petrenko A.G. Holz R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 519-528Google Scholar). In addition to the location of suREJ1 and suREJ3 on the cell membrane covering the acrosomal vesicle, the exocytosis regulatory proteins, soluble NSF attachment protein (SNAP)-25, vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), and syntaxin are all exclusive to the acrosomal region of sea urchin sperm (46Schulz J.R. Wessel G.M. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 191: 80-87Google Scholar, 47Schulz J.R. Sasaki J.D. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24355-24359Google Scholar). Antibodies to suREJ1 induce the exocytotic AR of sea urchin sperm (2Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar). However, neither the S/C and R3p antibodies made to the extracellular NH2-terminal half, nor the IH antibody made to the intracellular COOH-terminal half of suREJ3 induce the AR. suREJ1 is known to bind to the fucose sulfate polymer of egg jelly (2Moy G.W. Mendoza L.M. Schulz J.R. Swanson W.J. Glabe C.G. Vacquier V.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 809-817Google Scholar, 3Vacquier V.D. Moy G.W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 125-135Google Scholar). Two different isotypes of this polymer exist that differ in the placement of sulfate groups. Both are linear polymers of α-l-1,3-linked fucose with a molecular mass of approximately one million (4Alves A.P. Mulloy B. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Mourão P.A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 939-946Google Scholar). We do not know if the fucose sulfate polymer, or other ligands in egg jelly, bind to suREJ3. The AR always requires the fucose sulfate polymer; however, oligosaccharide chains of egg jelly glycoproteins greatly enhance the fucose sulfate polymer-induced AR, suggesting that other sperm receptor proteins are involved in the inductive mechanism (48Keller S.H. Vacquier V.D. Dev. Growth Differ. 1994; 36: 551-556Google Scholar). 2N. Hirohashi and V. D. Vacquier, unpublished data. Many scenarios are possible for the involvement of both suREJ1 and suREJ3 in the AR. They may represent redundant signaling pathways, or the two sea urchin sperm receptors could interact in the same pathway. From the similarities of the proteins shown in Fig. 2, and the fact that polycystin-1 and -2 (11Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Google Scholar), polycystin-2L (10Chen X.-Z. Vassilev P.M. Basora N. Peng J.-B. Nomura H. Segal Y. Brown E.M. Reeders S.T. Hediger M.A. Zhou J. Nature. 1999; 401: 383-386Google Scholar), and polycystin-2 from syncytiotrophoblast (12González-Perret S. Kim K. Ibarra C. Damiano A.E. Zotta E. Batelli M. Harris P.C. Reisin I.L. Arnaout M.A. Cantiello H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1182-1187Google Scholar) form nonselective cation channels, it is valid to speculate that suREJ3 may form an ion channel or be a component of the regulatory apparatus of a channel. Both polycystin-2 and transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) are excellent candidates for components of such a channel in the sperm AR. TRPCs were first described in Drosophila photoreception as store-operated cation channels (49Montell C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 755-763Google Scholar). TRPC-1, a mammalian TRP homolog, associates with polycystin-2 through the COOH-terminal coiled-coil domain and also TMS regions (50Tsiokas L. Arnould T. Zhu C. Kim E. Walz G. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3934-3939Google Scholar). Mouse TRPC-2 has been shown to mediate the sustained increase in calcium associated with the sperm AR (51Jungnickel M.K. Marrero H. Birnbaumer L. Lémos J.R. Florman H.M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 499-502Google Scholar). Unlike polycystin-1 and -2 (50Tsiokas L. Arnould T. Zhu C. Kim E. Walz G. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3934-3939Google Scholar, 52Qian F. Germino F.J. Yiqiang C. Zhang X. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 179-183Google Scholar), sea urchin suREJ3, mammalian PKDREJ (15Hughes J. Ward C.J. Aspinwall R. Butler R. Harris P.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 543-549Google Scholar) and C. elegans Lov-1 (13Barr M.M. Sternberg P.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 386-389Google Scholar) do not have a predicted coiled-coil domain in their COOH-terminal ends. Thus, these three proteins, which are all involved in male reproduction, might interact with proteins through other domains. Although clearly related to each other in their COOH-terminal halves, there is much less relationship among them in their NH2-terminal halves. Until the discovery of the sea urchin REJ proteins, the proteins associated with gamete recognition in sea urchins have been unrelated to known mammalian proteins. The smaller genomic size of the sea urchin (800 megabases) and the characteristic of fewer duplicated genes than found in mammals may make the sea urchin a more tractable model for discovering the pathways of signal transduction leading to the deuterostome sperm AR. Further study of suREJ3 may help clarify the function of polycystin-1 and its role in the genesis of polycystic kidney disease in humans, as well as contribute to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of sperm-egg interactions in both sea urchins and mammals. We thank W. J. Swanson and J. R. Schulz for many important discussions."

Restored Socs1 expression suppresses both growth rate and anchorage-independent growth of such human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, supporting the notion that SOCS1 may indeed be a tumor suppressor.We now demonstrate the role of a proto-oncogenic transcriptional repressor, GFI-1B (growth factorindependence), in regulating Socs1 andSocs3 expression in response to erythropoietin (EPO).1Gfi-1B was cloned based on its sequence similarity to Gfi-1, a target of provirus integration in T-cell lymphoma lines selected for interleukin-2 independence in culture and in primary retrovirus-induced lymphomas (22Tong B.

Cell.

Grimes H.L. Yang T.-Y. Bear S.E. Qin Z. Du K. El-Deiry W.S. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 32D-EpoR and HCD57, two EPO-responsive cell lines, expressGfi-1B, but not Gfi-1. In response to EPO stimulation, Socs1, Socs2, Socs3, andCis transcript levels increase, whereas Gfi-1Blevels decline. We provide evidence that GFI-1B directly represses the promoters of Socs1 and Socs3 through specific DNA-binding elements and that EPO-induced Gfi-1B diminution relies on STAT5 activity, but is independent of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or MAPK pathways. Thus, cytokine-mediated activation of STAT5 allows relief of direct repression by GFI-1B of distinctSocs promoters. In summary, we have identified a novel mechanism for controlling responsiveness to cytokines; a mechanism for differential regulation of Socs genes; and new targets to account for the oncogenic properties of GFI-1 family members, which have previously been shown to directly repress genes that control the cell cycle and apoptosis (22Tong B.

Grimes H.L. Yang T.-Y. Bear S.E. Qin Z. Du K. El-Deiry W.S. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,35Schmidt T. Karsunky H. Gau E. Zevnik B. Elsasser H.P. Moroy T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2661-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated a link betweenGfi-1B and Socs1 as well as Socs3. Namely, we have identified functional binding sites for GFI-1B in the promoters of Socs1 (−763 to −774 and −900 to −911) andSocs3 (−2057 to −2068). Furthermore, disrupting the GFI-1B-binding sites in STAT5 binding-defective promoter mutants still allows relief of the repressive effects of GFI-1B, suggesting that GFI-1B does not act solely, if at all, by interfering with STAT5 binding to its corresponding sites.Indeed, the mechanism of action of GFI-1B as a transcriptional repressor is not clear. GFI-1B, like GFI-1, contains a 20-amino acid N-terminal SNAG repressor domain, and it has been demonstrated for GFI-1 (but not for GFI-1B) that its repressive function may be position- and orientation-independent (31Grimes H.L. Chan T.O. Zweidler-McKay P.A. Tong B. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Recently, GFI-1 was shown to interact with PIAS3 (which specifically inhibits STAT3-mediated transcription of target genes), to inhibit PIAS3 action, and therefore to enhance STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation (36Rodel B. Tavassoli K. Karsunky H. Schmidt T. Bachmann M. Schaper F. Heinrich P. Shuai K. Elsasser H.P. Moroy T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5845-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Extending this finding to GFI-1B, however, is not necessarily warranted because the SNAG domain of GFI-1 is not sufficient for binding to PIAS3, and the sequence similarity between GFI-1 and GFI-1B is limited to the SNAG domain and C-terminal zinc fingers (22Tong B. Grimes H.L. Yang T.-Y. Bear S.E. Qin Z. Du K. El-Deiry W.S. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Our finding that GFI-1B is an important negative regulator of theSocs1 promoter may be compatible with recent evidence suggesting that transcriptional silencing of Socs1 through aberrant methylation in its CpG islands may contribute to oncogenesis (20Nagai H. Kim Y.S. Lee K.T. Chu M.Y. Konishi N. Fujimoto J. Baba M. Matsubara K. Emi M. J. Hepatol. (Amst.). 2001; 34: 416-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Yoshikawa H. Matsubara K. Qian G.S. Jackson P. Groopman J.D. Manning J.E. Harris C.C. Herman J.G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 29-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It would be interesting to determine, for instance, if GFI-1B interacts with one of the components of the methyl-CpG-binding MeCP1 complex to stabilize it (37Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar). One must search for GFI-1B-binding proteins to begin to address such issues. However, given the relatively long distances of GFI-1B-binding sites from the transcriptional start sites of target genes (1.5 kb for p21Waf1, 0.8–0.9 kb for Socs1, and 2.1 kb forSocs3), association with a complex silencer region is likely in each case.In addition, we have shown that EPO down-regulates Gfi-1Btranscript levels through a mechanism independent of PI3K and MAPK, but requiring the STAT5 C terminus, which contains its transcriptional activation domain. Indeed, new protein synthesis is required for STAT5-mediated Gfi-1B down-regulation, which is maximal at 1–2 h of EPO stimulation.Combining our findings (along with those of others) reveals a scheme whereby STAT5 can control cytokine-response genes through two mechanisms. Although our studies are confined to EPO signaling, we speculate that such a scheme is more general, given the multitude of cytokines that activate STAT5. Furthermore, others have demonstrated that stimulation of myelomonocytic M1 cells with interleukin-6, which activates STAT3, results in Gfi-1B down-regulation (22Tong B. Grimes H.L. Yang T.-Y. Bear S.E. Qin Z. Du K. El-Deiry W.S. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, in the absence of cytokine signaling (indicated by dashed lines), GFI-1B is abundant and represses the promoters of STAT5 targets such asSocs1, Socs3, and p21Waf1 (22Tong B. Grimes H.L. Yang T.-Y. Bear S.E. Qin Z. Du K. El-Deiry W.S. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Upon cytokine stimulation (solid lines), activation of STAT5, in addition to causing direct activation of its target genes, allowsGfi-1B levels to decline, thereby relieving direct repression of these promoters. It would be interesting to determine whether other transcriptional repressors regulate those STAT target genes that are not regulated by GFI-1B. STAT5 phosphorylation is maximal within minutes of cytokine stimulation, whereasGfi-1B down-regulation is maximal after 1–2 h of cytokine stimulation. Thus, initial induction of Socsgenes is attributable to transcriptional activation of their promoters by STAT5, whereas maintenance of Socs1 and Socs3levels can be achieved, in part, through relief of transcriptional repression by GFI-1B. These results underscored the importance of multi-level control of Socsgene expression in tightly regulated cytokine-mediated effects. Responsiveness to cytokines depends upon a balance of positive and negative regulators. The latter includes at least three protein classes. SHP1 (SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosinephosphatase-1), PIAS (proteininhibitors of activated STAT proteins), and SOCS (suppressors ofcytokine signaling) (1Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are at least eight members of the SOCS family, each of which contains a variable N-terminal region, a central SH2 domain, and a conserved C-terminal SOCS box domain (2Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T.

However, given the relatively long distances of GFI-1B-binding sites from the transcriptional start sites of target genes (1.5 kb for p21Waf1, 0.8–0.9 kb for Socs1, and 2.1 kb forSocs3), association with a complex silencer region is likely in each case.In addition, we have shown that EPO down-regulates Gfi-1Btranscript levels through a mechanism independent of PI3K and MAPK, but requiring the STAT5 C terminus, which contains its transcriptional activation domain. Indeed, new protein synthesis is required for STAT5-mediated Gfi-1B down-regulation, which is maximal at 1–2 h of EPO stimulation.Combining our findings (along with those of others) reveals a scheme whereby STAT5 can control cytokine-response genes through two mechanisms. Although our studies are confined to EPO signaling, we speculate that such a scheme is more general, given the multitude of cytokines that activate STAT5. Furthermore, others have demonstrated that stimulation of myelomonocytic M1 cells with interleukin-6, which activates STAT3, results in Gfi-1B down-regulation (22Tong B. Grimes H.L. Yang T.-Y. Bear S.E. Qin Z. Du K. El-Deiry W.S. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, in the absence of cytokine signaling (indicated by dashed lines), GFI-1B is abundant and represses the promoters of STAT5 targets such asSocs1, Socs3, and p21Waf1 (22Tong B. Grimes H.L. Yang T.-Y. Bear S.E. Qin Z. Du K. El-Deiry W.S. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K.

Upon cytokine stimulation (solid lines), activation of STAT5, in addition to causing direct activation of its target genes, allowsGfi-1B levels to decline, thereby relieving direct repression of these promoters. It would be interesting to determine whether other transcriptional repressors regulate those STAT target genes that are not regulated by GFI-1B. STAT5 phosphorylation is maximal within minutes of cytokine stimulation, whereasGfi-1B down-regulation is maximal after 1–2 h of cytokine stimulation. Thus, initial induction of Socsgenes is attributable to transcriptional activation of their promoters by STAT5, whereas maintenance of Socs1 and Socs3levels can be achieved, in part, through relief of transcriptional repression by GFI-1B. These results underscored the importance of multi-level control of Socsgene expression in tightly regulated cytokine-mediated effects. SOCS family members are critical regulators of cytokine signaling, and recent evidence supports the notion of at least one member, SOCS1, being a tumor suppressor (20Nagai H. Kim Y.S. Lee K.T.

Genet. 2001; 28: 29-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B, on the other hand, are proto-oncogenes, the former being implicated in T-cell lymphomagenesis and the latter found to be a target of provirus integration in a subset of B-cell lymphomas induced by Moloney murine leukemia virus in Eμ-myc transgenic, pim-1/pim-2 null mice (22Tong B.

Moroy T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2661-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated a link betweenGfi-1B and Socs1 as well as Socs3. Namely, we have identified functional binding sites for GFI-1B in the promoters of Socs1 (−763 to −774 and −900 to −911) andSocs3 (−2057 to −2068). Furthermore, disrupting the GFI-1B-binding sites in STAT5 binding-defective promoter mutants still allows relief of the repressive effects of GFI-1B, suggesting that GFI-1B does not act solely, if at all, by interfering with STAT5 binding to its corresponding sites. Indeed, the mechanism of action of GFI-1B as a transcriptional repressor is not clear. GFI-1B, like GFI-1, contains a 20-amino acid N-terminal SNAG repressor domain, and it has been demonstrated for GFI-1 (but not for GFI-1B) that its repressive function may be position- and orientation-independent (31Grimes H.L. Chan T.O. Zweidler-McKay P.A. Tong B. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6263-6272Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Recently, GFI-1 was shown to interact with PIAS3 (which specifically inhibits STAT3-mediated transcription of target genes), to inhibit PIAS3 action, and therefore to enhance STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation (36Rodel B. Tavassoli K. Karsunky H. Schmidt T. Bachmann M. Schaper F. Heinrich P. Shuai K. Elsasser H.P. Moroy T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5845-5855Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Extending this finding to GFI-1B, however, is not necessarily warranted because the SNAG domain of GFI-1 is not sufficient for binding to PIAS3, and the sequence similarity between GFI-1 and GFI-1B is limited to the SNAG domain and C-terminal zinc fingers (22Tong B. Grimes H.L. Yang T.-Y. Bear S.E. Qin Z. Du K. El-Deiry W.S. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2462-2473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that GFI-1B is an important negative regulator of theSocs1 promoter may be compatible with recent evidence suggesting that transcriptional silencing of Socs1 through aberrant methylation in its CpG islands may contribute to oncogenesis (20Nagai H.

The building block is a repeating disaccharide unit with GlcAβ1–3GalNAc, and its GalNAc residue is usually monosulfated. When sulfation occurs mainly at C-6 of the internal GalNAc residue, it is called chondroitin 6-sulfate, whereas the C-4 sulfated form is called chondroitin 4-sulfate. A variant of chondroitin 4-sulfate containing some iduronic acid residues instead of GlcA is known as dermatan sulfate, and its disaccharide unit is designated as the chondroitin sulfate B unit. Chondroitin sulfate D and E have oversulfated structures, GlcA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S) and GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S), respectively (1Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Google Scholar). The structural diversity including various pattern of sulfate group attachment in GAGs suggests the pathological and biological importance of proteoglycan molecules (2Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 115-127Google Scholar, 3Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are the main components in the cartilage, and their sulfation profiles vary in relation to aging (4Plaas A.H.K. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5228-5234Google Scholar), and have been suggested to participate in signaling or modulation of the activities of these factors. However, the in vivo function of chondroitin sulfate has not been clarified directly. Sulfate groups attached to GAG chains are transferred from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) by sulfotransferases with strict acceptor specificities (2Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1474: 115-127Google Scholar). Chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (C6ST) catalyzes the last step of synthesis of chondroitin 6-sulfate, and transfers sulfate to the C-6 position of the GalNAc residue of chondroitin. Recent studies have shown that C6ST can sulfate the Gal residues of keratan sulfate (18Habuchi O. Hirahara Y. Uchimura K. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 51-57Google Scholar) as well as sialyl lactosamine oligosaccharides (19Habuchi O. Suzuki Y. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 405-412Google Scholar). C6ST cDNAs have been cloned in the chicken (20Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Google Scholar) and subsequently in the mouse (21Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T.

To determine the roles of C6ST and its product, chondroitin 6-sulfate, in vivo, we utilized gene knockout technology deleting the mouse C6ST gene, C6st. In the present study, we have shown that the number of naive T lymphocytes in the spleen ofC6st−/− mice was significantly decreased. To obtain mouse C6ST genomic DNA, a 129SV/J mouse genomic library (Stratagene) was screened using mouse C6ST cDNA (ml1; Ref.21Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Google Scholar) as a probe. Plaque hybridization was carried out as described previously (21Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Google Scholar). Two positive clones (termed 8-6 and 3-1), containing a 15-kb DNA fragment that included the C6ST coding exons, were isolated (Fig. 1A). After sequencing the insert DNA fragments, the localization of the exons was determined by comparison of the sequences between the inserted genomic DNA and several cDNAs obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR as described previously (21Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Google Scholar) and Southern blot analysis using the cDNA as a probe (21Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Google Scholar). TheC6st targeting vector was constructed from a basic targeting vector with MC1neo (polyoma virus thymidine kinase gene promoter and neomycin resistance gene) and DTA (diphtheria toxin fragment A gene) (23Igakura T. Kadomatsu K. Kaname T. Muramatsu H. Fan Q.-W. Miyauchi T. Toyama Y. Kuno N. Yuasa S. Takahashi M. Senda T. Taguchi O. Yamamura K. Arimura K. Muramatsu T. Dev. Biol. 1998; 194: 152-165Google Scholar) and C6st fragments. To delete a 1.2-kb portion of C6st exon II (KpnI-SmaI sites in Fig. 1B), a 4.7-kbSacI/KpnI fragment and 2.3-kb SmaI fragment were used as the 5′-arm and the 3′-arm, respectively (Fig.1B). Aliquots of 18 μg of NotI-linearized targeting vector DNA were electroporated into 1 × 107 D3 ES cells. The cells were plated on mitomycin C-treated G418-resistant SL-10 cell feeder layers. G418 (250 μg/ml; Sigma) was added 24 h after plating. G418-resistant colonies were picked up after 7–8 days and then propagated to be stored and examined for homologous recombination by Southern blot analysis as described below. Approximately 15 ES cells of the targeted clones were injected into blastocysts derived from naturally mated C57BL/6J females. The injected embryos were transferred to the uteri of pseudopregnant ICR mice. To yield null mutants of 129SV/J background, chimeric male mice were mated with 129SV/J mice. Then, F1 progeny were back-crossed four times to 129SV/J mice and mated with each other. Southern blot analysis was performed as described previously (21Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Google Scholar) for DNA samples digested with EcoRI. The membrane was hybridized with a 0.7-kbHincII-NcoI fragment corresponding to the genomic DNA downstream of the 3′-arm of the targeting vector (Fig.1B). The homologously recombined DNA gave a 7.8-kb band, whereas the wild-type DNA gave a 14.2-kb band (Fig. 1C). Total RNA prepared from the mouse spleen was electrophoresed and transferred onto a nylon membrane, and then hybridized with the radioactive probes as described previously (21Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed using a 400-bp DNA fragment corresponding to part of theC6st gene (PCR product described below) as a probe. Aliquots of 0.5 μg of DNA were mixed with 20 μl of 1 × AmpliTaq® buffer containing 0.2 mmeach dNTP, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 pmol of each primer, and 0.5 unit of AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). PCR amplification was carried out at 94 °C for 3 min, with 35 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 56 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. To screen for homologously recombined DNA,C6st primers were used: 5′-ATGCATCTCTCTTGTCCCTGA-3′ (6ST-F) and 5′-CACATACAGGTCGCATAGCAA-3′ (6ST-R). The wild-type allele gave a 400-bp band, whereas the mutated allele gave no band. Neo primers were also used: 5′-CAGCGTCTTGTCATTGGCGA-3′ (Neo-F) and 5′-GCTCTTCGTCCAGATCATCC-3′ (Neo-R). The wild-type allele gave no band, whereas the mutated allele gave a 600-bp band. Mouse tissues were removed and then homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in 1.5 ml of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the activities of C6ST and C4ST in the supernatant fractions were measured as described previously (24Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Google Scholar) with slight modifications. After the standard reaction, 35S-labeled chondroitin substrates were purified using a Fast Desalting Column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and were collected as described previously (24Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21968-21974Google Scholar). The collected 35S-labeled products were dissolved in 50 μl of a buffer containing 0.05 m Tris acetate, pH 7.5, and 10 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Proteus vulgaris; Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan). After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the digested materials were applied to a Partisil 10-SAX column (4.6 cm × 25 cm, Whatman), and fractions were collected at 30 s intervals as described previously (20Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Google Scholar). C6ST activity and C4ST activity were determined according to the incorporation into ΔDi-6S and ΔDi-4S, respectively. Mouse spleens (1 g) and brains (4.5 g) were removed from 8 mice (5–6-week-old males) and 20 mice (over 10-week-old males), respectively. Tissues were homogenized in 10 ml of ice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride for 3 min. The homogenate was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5m sucrose, 0.1 m KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2, and then centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was suspended in 10 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 8 mm CHAPS, and 2.5 mg of proteinase K, and then incubated at 50 °C for 4 h. After further incubation with 2.5 mg of proteinase K at 50 °C for 12 h, 50 μg of RNase A (Sigma) and 50 μg of DNase I (Takara, Tokyo) were added, and then the reaction mixture was stored at 37 °C for 1 h. The extract was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was applied to a column containing 4 ml of DEAE-Sephacel following by adjusting its concentration of NaCl to 0.5 m. The column was washed with five column volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 8 mm CHAPS. Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate fractions were then eluted with two column volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1.5 m NaCl and 8 mm CHAPS with monitoring at 210 nm. The collected fractions were dialyzed against distilled water. Aliquots of 10 μg of chondroitin/dermatan sulfates extracted from the mouse spleen and brain were digested with chondroitinase ABC as described above. Samples before or after chondro-6-sulfatase (P. vulgaris; Seikagaku Kogyo) treatment (10 milliunits, at 37 °C for 12 h) were then analyzed by HPLC (Partisil-10 SAX, 4.6 cm × 25 cm, Whatman) as described previously (20Fukuta M. Uchimura K. Nakashima K. Kato M. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Habuchi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18575-18580Google Scholar). After mincing the spleen, thymus, peripheral lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches in Hanks' balanced salt solution, single-cell suspensions were prepared in the same ice-cold solution. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 15 min in 10 μg/ml Fc blocker (anti-CD32/16, 2.4G2; PharMingen) before staining with various antibodies. Cells were stained for 30 min at 4 °C in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 400-fold diluted antibody, and then washed with the same buffer. FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest soft ware (Becton Dickinson) were used to analyze the stained cells. The antibodies against the following antigens were from PharMingen: CD3 (2C11), CD4 (RM4–5), CD8 (53–6.7), CD11b (M1–70), CD11c (HL3), CD21 (7G6), CD22 (Cy34.1), CD23 (B3B4), CD24 (M1/69), CD43 (S7), CD44 (IM7), CD62L (MEL-14), mouse IgM (R6–60.2), mouse IgD (11–26c.2a), Ly-6G (Gr-1), B220 (RA3–6B2), TER-119 (Ly-76), and I-Ab (Afb-120.1). Mouse tissues were frozen in Tissue-Tek (Sakura Finetek). Cryostat sections (5 μm thick) were fixed in acetone for 5 min and then reacted with the appropriate antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently incubated with secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline , slides were developed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. For detection of carbohydrate epitopes, a Vectastain® ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) was used instead of secondary antibody. The antibodies used were biotin-conjugated anti-chondroitin 6-sulfate (MC21C), anti-chondroitin sulfate D (MO-225), and anti-keratan sulfate (5D4), all from Seikagaku Kogyo. Subsequently, spleen sections were counterstained by methyl green solution. For Nissl's staining, brains were embedded in paraffin and serially sectioned in the coronal plane. Lymphocyte trafficking in vivo was carried out according to the published procedures with slight modifications (25Rosen S.D. Chi S.-I. True D.D. Singer M.S. Yednock T.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1895-1902Google Scholar, 26Maly P. Thall A.D. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L. Camper S.A. Camphausen R.T. Sullivan F.X. Isogai Y. Hindsgaul O. von Andrian U.H. Lowe J.B. Cell. 1996; 86: 643-653Google Scholar). Mesenteric and axillary lymphocytes from 5–6-week-old C6st+/+ mice were isolated and then labeled with 5 μm 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA; Molecular Probes). After washing with Hanks' balanced salt solution, the cells (2.5 × 107 in 250 μl of the washing solution) were injected into the tail veins of age-matched C6st+/+ andC6st−/− mice. After 1.5 h, the animals were sacrificed and secondary lymphoid organs were removed. CMFDA-positive lymphocytes in the organs were analyzed by flow cytometry. For detection of the trafficked cells in the spleen, the organ was immediately frozen and then cryostat sections were prepared as described above. Biotin-conjugated anti-CD3 antibody and PE-conjugated streptavidin (PharMingen) were used to detect the T cell zones. Two overlapping clones covering the mouse C6st gene were isolated by screening a 129SV/J mouse genomic library (Stratagene) using mouse C6ST cDNA as a probe. Both clones, termed clone 8-6 and 3-1 (Fig.1A), contained the whole protein-coding region of the C6ST cDNA, and the region appeared to be encoded by two exons divided by a 1.2-kb intron (Fig.1A). Exon II contained the translation initiation codon. The sequences of the intron-exon splice junctions obeyed the GT-AG rule (27Shapiro M.B. Senapathy P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7155-7174Google Scholar). The split site of exon II and exon III was between nucleotides 375 and 376 of mouse C6ST cDNA described previously (see Fig. 1A in Ref. 21Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Google Scholar). To determine the transcription initiation site of the gene, several cDNAs encoding 5′-flanking region of mouse C6st mRNAs in the spleen were isolated by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR analysis as described previously (21Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Google Scholar) and then sequenced. Sequence comparison between the cloned cDNAs and the genomic clones revealed that three unique DNA sequences, types a–c as exon I, were present in the 5′ region upstream of C6st translation initiation codon (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, alternative transcription initiation sites and alternative usage of exon Ia–Ic were identified (Fig. 1A), suggesting that tissue-specific expression of the mouse C6st gene might be regulated by multiple promoters. Thus, the mouse C6stgene spans over 20 kb (Fig. 1A). We designed a targeting construct to delete part of the catalytic region in exon III. The deletion resulted in loss of the whole 5′-PAPS binding domain and a portion of the 3′-PAPS binding domain (28Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 129-130Google Scholar), so that any resulting translated enzyme would not have the ability to catalyze sulfation. By standard gene knockout technology, mice with deletion C6st(C6st−/−) were produced. By mating ofC6st+/− mice, C6st−/−mice were born in the Mendelian ratio. There were no apparent differences between wild-type and the knockout mice in their gross morphology or results of histological examination. No significant differences were observed in body weight ofC6st−/− mice as compared withC6st+/+ mice 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 weeks after birth. The knockout mice reproduced normally and also survived for 2 years without any abnormalities as compared with wild-type controls. Southern blot analysis confirmed that the C6st gene was deleted in the knockout mice (Fig. 1C), and noC6st mRNA was detected in these mice (Fig.1D). C6ST activity was not detected in the spleen, lung peripheral lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes, or Peyer's patches ofC6st−/− mice (Fig. 1E). Chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase activity in such tissues was also assayed and appeared to be normal in C6st−/− mice (Fig.1F). We chemically analyzed chondroitin/dermatan sulfates extracted from the spleen. After chondroitinase ABC digestion, the major disaccharide released from the sample ofC6st+/+ was ΔDi-4S (Fig.2A, peak 3). In addition, a small peak appeared at the position of ΔDi-6S (peak 2) and ΔDi-diSE or ΔDi-diSB (peaks 5 and6). Chondroitin 6-sulfatase digestion caused disappearance of ΔDi-6S and ΔDi-diSE peaks (Fig. 2B). InC6st−/− mice, ΔDi-6S level was decreased to less than 10% of that in the wild-type control (Fig. 2C), whereas amounts of ΔDi-4S and ΔDi-diSE were not changed (Fig. 2D). Thus, C6st is not involved in formation of the E unit, GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S), in the spleen. In chondroitin/dermatan sulfates extracted from the brain of adult mouse, the major disaccharides component was also ΔDi-4S (Fig. 2,E–H, peak 3). As in the case of the sample from the spleen, a small amount of ΔDi-6S present in the sample from C6st+/+ brain (Fig. 2E,peak 2) mostly disappeared in that ofC6st−/− brain (Fig. 2G,peak 2), whereas the amount of ΔDi-diSE was not changed (Fig. 2, E andG). Interestingly, a small amount of ΔDi-diSDdetected in the sample from C6st+/+ mice (Fig.2E, peak 4) was absent in the sample from C6st−/− (Fig. 2G). Therefore,C6st is involved in formation of D unit, GlcA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S), in the adult brain. Expression of chondroitin sulfate was also examined by immunohistochemical staining. When cryostat sections of the spleen were stained with MC21C antibody, which reacts with chondroitin 6-sulfate, reticular fibers and trabeculae including arteries were positive in theC6st+/+ mice (Fig.3A), whereas those fromC6st−/− mice were negative except in the arteries (Fig. 3B). Cartilage tissues inC6st+/+ day 13.5 embryos strongly expressed chondroitin sulfate D as determined by staining with MO225 antibody (Fig. 3C). MO225-positive signals completely disappeared in the C6st−/− embryos (Fig. 3D). Thus, C6st is also involved in formation of D unit in the embryo cartilage. C6ST also sulfates the C-6 position of Gal residues in keratan sulfate in vitro (18Habuchi O. Hirahara Y. Uchimura K. Fukuta M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 51-57Google Scholar, 21Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Google Scholar). 5D4 monoclonal antibody that recognizes keratan sulfate was used to evaluate whether biosynthesis of keratan sulfate in C6st−/−mice was affected. 5D4-positive signals were observed in the thalamus of C6st+/+ day 15.5 embryos (Fig.3E). The intensity of 5D4-positive signals was unchanged in the thalamus of the C6st−/− embryos (Fig.3F). Therefore, C6st gene is not involved in synthesis of keratan sulfate in the embryonic thalamus. Because the chondroitin sulfate D motif, which disappeared from the brain of C6st−/− mice, was shown to promote neurite outgrowth (7Clement A.M. Nadanaka S. Masayama K. Mandl C. Sugahara K. Faissner A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28444-28453Google Scholar), we compared brain structure betweenC6st+/+ and C6st−/−mice by histological analysis, and found no differences. In particular, normal organization of the cerebral cortex and orientation of processes for pyramidal cells in C6st−/− brain were revealed by Nissl's staining method (Fig.4, A–D). Then, we investigated whether the chondroitin sulfate D structure also disappeared from the brain of the null embryos. By using MO225 monoclonal antibody, chondroitin sulfate D structure was detected in the neocortical neuroepithelium in the telencephalon ofC6st+/+ day 15.5 embryos, whereas the signals in that of C6st−/− day 15.5 embryos were not observed (Fig. 4, E and F). Although gross morphology of lymphoid organs was not different betweenC6st+/+ mice andC6st−/− mice, the relatively strong expression of C6st mRNA in the spleen and bone marrow of mice led us to examine leukocyte populations in the spleen. We determined the numbers of free cells from the spleen, peripheral lymph nodes, mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. The number of spleen cells in C6st−/− mice was similar to that of C6st+/+ mice (TableI). Then, we analyzed lymphocyte subpopulations in C6st+/+ andC6st−/− mice. Both the percentage and number of naive T lymphocytes were significantly decreased in the spleen ofC6st−/− mice at 5–6 weeks after birth (Fig.5, Table I). No such difference was observed in other lymphoid organs. The absolute number of naive T lymphocytes in the spleen of C6st−/− mice was ∼68% of that in C6st+/+ mice 5–6 weeks after birth. This result was reproducible in three independent sets of experiments. Neither chondroitin 6-sulfate nor chondroitin sulfate D was expressed on the surface of naive T lymphocytes as revealed by FACS using MC21C or MO225 antibody (data not shown). Thus, chondroitin 6-sulfate in the extracellular space (Fig. 3A) appears to be involved in the phenomenonTable IFACS analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations in lymphoid organs of 5–6-week-old C6st+/+ and C6st−/− miceLymphoid organsCell typePercentage of positive cellsNo. of positive cells (106 cells/organ)C6st+/+C6st−/−C6st+/+C6st−/−Spleen1-aThe total number of free cells is shown (106 cells/organ).61.7 ± 22.859.9 ± 24.7B220+1-bBoth the percentage to the total white blood cells and the number are shown.46.7 ± 3.044.3 ± 5.229.0 ± 11.226.8 ± 12.4CD3+1-bBoth the percentage to the total white blood cells and the number are shown.29.7 ± 4.726.5 ± 6.717.8 ± 5.614.7 ± 3.4CD62L+CD44low1-cBoth the percentage to the total CD3-positive cells and the number are shown.53.4 ± 8.043.8 ± 8.7*9.3 ± 2.56.3 ± 1.2**CD62L−CD44high1-cBoth the percentage to the total CD3-positive cells and the number are shown.4.1 ± 0.85.1 ± 0.40.7 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.1Peripheral lymph nodes1-aThe total number of free cells is shown (106 cells/organ).2.6 ± 1.62.9 ± 1.3B220+1-bBoth the percentage to the total white blood cells and the number are shown.14.8 ± 3.817.1 ± 3.60.4 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.3CD3+1-bBoth the percentage to the total white blood cells and the number are shown.79.4 ± 5.676.7 ± 5.32.0 ± 1.22.1 ± 0.8CD62L+CD44low1-cBoth the percentage to the total CD3-positive cells and the number are shown.84.5 ± 4.684.4 ± 4.91.7 ± 1.01.8 ± 0.6CD62L−CD44high1-cBoth the percentage to the total CD3-positive cells and the number are shown.3.0 ± 0.81.9 ± 0.70.04 ± 0.030.03 ± 0.01Mesenteric lymph nodes1-aThe total number of free cells is shown (106 cells/organ).4.0 ± 0.84.8 ± 0.8B220+1-bBoth the percentage to the total white blood cells and the number are shown.24.1 ± 3.926.4 ± 2.81.0 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.3CD3+1-bBoth the percentage to the total white blood cells and the number are shown.67.8 ± 5.365.8 ± 3.52.7 ± 0.63.3 ± 0.4CD62L+CD44low1-cBoth the percentage to the total CD3-positive cells and the number are shown.84.5 ± 3.584.7 ± 4.42.3 ± 0.62.6 ± 0.5CD62L−CD44high1-cBoth the percentage to the total CD3-positive cells and the number are shown.0.7 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.30.04 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.01Peyer's patches1-aThe total number of free cells is shown (106 cells/organ).0.4 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.2B220+1-bBoth the percentage to the total white blood cells and the number are shown.60.2 ± 6.157.6 ± 6.50.2 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.1CD3+1-bBoth the percentage to the total white blood cells and the number are shown.26.7 ± 3.228.1 ± 4.30.1 ± 0.020.1 ± 0.04CD62L+CD44low1-cBoth the percentage to the total CD3-positive cells and the number are shown.44.2 ± 10.147.5 ± 10.80.04 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.02CD62L−CD44high1-cBoth"

The x-ray crystal structure of the Ly49A·H-2Dd complex revealed that homodimeric Ly49A interacts at two distinct sites of H-2Dd: Site 1, spanning one side of the α1 and α2 helices, and Site 2, involving the α1, α2, α3, and β2m domains.

Fundamental Immunology. 4th Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1999: 575-603Google Scholar). NK cell activation is regulated by a balance of activating and inhibitory signals delivered through receptors of the immunoglobulin and C-type lectin-like superfamilies, that recognize MHC-I or MHC-I-like molecules expressed on target cells (4Kärre K. Immunol. Rev. 1997; 155: 5-9Google Scholar). In resting NK cells the inhibitory signals dominate, and perturbation of normal expression of MHC-I, by viral infection or oncogenic dysregulation, leads to attenuation of the inhibitory signal and augmentation of the activating one. The best understood inhibitory NK receptor of the C-type lectin family is murine Ly49A, a type II membrane homodimer in which the structure in complex with the MHC-I ligand, H-2Dd, has been determined crystallographically (5Tormo J. Natarajan K. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 623-631Google Scholar). Direct interaction of Ly49A with H-2Dd has been demonstrated in cell adhesion and protein binding assays (6Daniels B.F. Karlhofer F.M. Seaman W.E. Yokoyama W.M. J. Exp.

Nature. 1999; 402: 623-631Google Scholar) indicated that the Ly49A homodimer interacts with two topographically distinct sites on H-2Dd (Fig. 1a). At Site 1, a single Ly49A subunit contacts one end of the MHC-I peptide-binding groove, involving the amino terminus of the α1 helix and the carboxyl terminus of α2. Site 2 is a concavity beneath the peptide-binding platform, bounded by amino acid residues of the floor of the β sheet of the α1 and α2 domains, as well as by the α3 domain and the MHC-I light chain, β2m.

Thus, although some evidence supports Site 1 as a primary region of interaction between MHC-I and Ly49A, other experiments are more consistent with Site 2 playing the predominant role, and some studies are inconclusive. To resolve the issue as to whether Site 1 or Site 2 plays the major role, we have exploited a well defined biochemical system using only recombinant, highly purified molecules. Using a panel of site-directed mutants of Ly49A, H-2Dd, and β2m in binding assays, we have determined kinetic and equilibrium parameters quantitatively. These data, viewed in the context of the crystal structure of the Ly49A·H-2Dd complex, define not only the dominant site of interaction of Ly49A with its MHC-I ligand as Site 2, but also provide insight into the importance of homodimeric interaction in maintaining the integrity of Ly49A. Inspection of the region of intermolecular contact at Site 2 reveals important contributions from a network of water molecules coordinated by Ly49A, H-2Dd, and β2m residues and helps to explain the allelic specificity and peptide preference that particular members of the Ly49 family exhibit. Mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the codons of interest to encode alanine substitutions. Using Stratagene's QuickChange Mutagenesis Kit and following the manufacturer's instructions, mutations were introduced into: 1) a cDNA construct encoding the entire extracellular region (residues 67–262) of the C57BL/6 allele of Ly49A in a bacterial expression vector (pET21a; Novagen) (9Natarajan K. Boyd L.F. Schuck P. Yokoyama W.M. Eilat D. Margulies D.H. Immunity. 1999; 11: 591-601Google Scholar); 2) a cDNA construct encoding the mature extracellular residues of H-2Dd in pET3a (24Li H. Natarajan K. Malchiodi E.L. Margulies D.H. Mariuzza R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 179-191Google Scholar); or 3) a murine β2m-encoding construct based on the C57BL/6 allele of β2m in pET21d (25Shields M.J. Moffat L.E. Ribaudo R.K. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 919-928Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing analysis using an ABI 377 DNA sequencer and accompanying sequencing analysis software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with these mutant plasmid DNAs for protein expression. Bacteria harboring either the parental or mutant Ly49A-, H-2Dd-, or β2m-encoding plasmid vectors were cultured in LB broth containing 0.25 mg/ml carbenicillin and, following induction of exponentially growing cells for 2 h with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, were lysed with 0.5 mg/ml of hen egg white lysozyme overnight at 4 °C and then with 0.1% deoxycholate for 30 min. The resulting inclusion bodies were washed first with 0.1% deoxycholate in TE buffer (0.1 mTris pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA) and then extensively with TE, and they were then denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and reduced with 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. Ly49A was refolded following dilution into an arginine buffer (0.4 m l-arginine-HCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 3 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione). Following dialysis against 25 mm MES, pH 5.5, protein was further purified by ion exchange chromatography (Mono-S) followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 column. H-2Dd was prepared similarly, with refolding taking place in the presence of mouse β2m and either a motif (AGPARAAAL) peptide (26Corr M. Boyd L.F. Padlan E.A. Margulies D.H. J. Exp.

Monoclonal antibodies used in BIAcore binding assays were: A1, specific for Ly49AC57BL/6 (29Nagasawa R. Gross J. Kanagawa O. Townsend K. Lanier L.L. Chiller J. Allison J.P. J.

The anti-Ly49G2 mAb 4D11 is described by Mason et al. (34Mason L.H. Ortaldo J.R. Young H.A. Kumar V. Bennett M. Anderson S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 293-303Google Scholar). Anti-Ly49C/I-reactive SW5E6 (35Sentman C.L. Hackett Jr., J. Kumar V. Bennett M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 191-202Google Scholar) was used as control for Ly49A binding. mAbs 34-2-12 (anti-H-2Dd α3 domain) and 34-5-8 (anti-H-2Dd α1/α2 domain) (36Ozato K. Mayer N. Sachs D.

Immunol. 1983; 130: 463-470Google Scholar) were from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). KP15, a mAb specific for H-2Dd bound to the HIV envelope glycoprotein-derived peptide Pro18-Ile10, has been described elsewhere (38Polakova K. Plaksin D. Chung D.H. Belyakov I.M. Berzofsky J.A. Margulies D.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5703-5712Google Scholar). All antibodies were used as purified proteins. A single-chain TCR (scTCR) with specificity for H-2Dd/Pro18-Ile10 was expressed inE. coli and purified as described previously (39Plaksin D. Polakova K. McPhie P. Margulies D.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2218-2227Google Scholar). Assays for binding of Ly49A, H-2Dd, and mAbs were based on kinetic progress curves obtained with the BIAcore 2000 using methods employed previously (9Natarajan K. Boyd L.F. Schuck P. Yokoyama W.M. Eilat D. Margulies D.H. Immunity. 1999; 11: 591-601Google Scholar, 40Corr M. Slanetz A.E. Boyd L.F. Jelonek M.T. Khilko S. al-Ramadi B.K. Kim Y.S. Maher S.E. Bothwell A.L. Margulies D.H. Science. 1994; 265: 946-949Google Scholar). In general, one ligand (either a mAb, Ly49A, or scTCR) was immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip using standard coupling procedures, and solution phase ligand (analyte) was offered at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. All binding experiments were performed at 25 °C. A mock-coupled surface that was activated and blocked but had no protein immobilized was always included as a control for nonspecific binding. When Ly49A mutants were evaluated, a Ly49A wild type-coupled surface was included on the same chip for direct comparison. Kinetic data were collected and analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.1 to calculate kinetic association and dissociation rate constants and equilibrium constants for dissociation. In all cases the potential for sequential deterioration of the integrity of the solid phase ligand was evaluated periodically with appropriate controls introduced throughout the run. Binding parameters obtained by kinetic analysis were compared with equilibrium parameters calculated in parallel and were always internally consistent. To evaluate the contribution of particular residues of Ly49A to recognition by H-2Dd, as well by specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we made individual alanine substitutions at those positions that, in the crystal structure, appeared crucial to either the homodimeric interaction or the interaction between H-2Dd and Ly49A (Fig. 1). Six Ly49A interface residues, Tyr142, Trp143, Phe144, Tyr146, Leu188, and Val189 were mutated, and the bacterially expressed mutant proteins were tested for binding to bacterially expressed H-2Dd as well as to a panel of anti-Ly49 mAbs. Although several mutants showed decreased binding to some of the mAbs tested, all preserved the capacity to interact with several at levels at least 50% that of controls (Fig.2a). Binding to 4D11, which primarily recognizes Ly49G2 and has weak activity on Ly49A, was lower for mutants at positions 142, 143, 146, and 189. Interestingly, 4D11 reactivity was greater for mutants at positions 144 and 188. Significantly, mutation at positions 142, 143, 146, and 189 each revealed decreased binding to either of the H-2Ddpreparations (Fig. 2b). These results suggest that the integrity of the homodimer is important for binding to the MHC-I ligand and also influences binding by some mAbs. Next, we examined mutants of Ly49A at H-2Dd contact sites. However, no contact residues of Ly49A are unique to Site 1, and therefore any mutation would either include both Sites 1 and 2 or be unique to Site 2. We first studied mutants at Site 2, the interface between Ly49A and H-2Dd that involves Ly49A and all three domains of H-2Dd as well as its light chain, β2m (Fig.1a). For H-2Dd binding, point mutations generally either improved binding (N203A and K224A) or impaired binding significantly (S236A, T238A, and R239A). S236A and R239A showed an undetectable level of binding to H-2Dd, and T238A quantitatively reduced binding by about 9-fold (KDincreasing from 1.82 to 15.9 μm largely as a result ofkd increasing from 0.063 to 0.363 s−1(Fig. 3b)). The behavior of the triad of Ser236, Thr238, and Arg239 clearly indicates the importance of Site 2 interactions in H-2Dd binding. Binding to a panel of mAbs indicated that the overall integrity of the mutants was preserved and also allowed mapping of epitopes recognized by particular mAbs (Fig.2). Mutants of N203A, K224A, S236A, T238A, and R239A revealed differences in binding to some of the mAbs. In particular, N203A showed augmented binding to A1, YE1/32, and YE1/48, had no effect on binding to JR9-318, and showed absolutely no binding to 4D11. K224A reduced binding to A1, YE1/48, and JR9-318 and increased binding to YE1/32. Mutants S236A, T238A, and R239A modestly decreased binding to A1, and R239A increased binding to YE1/32, YE1/48, and 4D11. We then analyzed seven mutants that represented contacts at both Sites 1 and 2: D229A, D241A, N242A, D246A, Q247A, V248A, and F249A (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). D229A, although it revealed little or no effect on binding of any of the mAbs, eliminated interaction with H-2Dd. D241A, which profoundly reduced binding to A1 but had little effect on any other mAb, also affected binding to H-2Dd, most significantly with an increase in the kd from 0.054 to 0.363 s−1 (Fig. 3). N242A modestly reduced binding to YE1/32 and 4D11 and also impeded interaction with H-2Dd. D246A, which adversely affects binding of YE1/32 and 4D11, also showed quantitative effects on binding to H-2Dd. Other mutations of residues that structurally contribute at both Sites 1 and 2, Q247A and F249A, did not impede mAb binding and augmented it in some cases. V248A impaired recognition by YE1/32. These three mutants showed quantitative effects on binding to H-2Dd/P18-I10 but less pronounced effects when assayed with H-2Dd·motif complexes. The most consistent of the effects observed was with F249A, which showed a slight increase in ka, a marked (more than 5-fold) increase in the kd, and a 5-fold increase in KD (Fig. 3b). To visualize the location of those Ly49A residues that influence H-2Dd and mAb interaction, we generated a surface representation of their effect on binding (Fig.4; Ly49A interface mutants are not seen in such a display). Mutations that adversely affected binding are colored in red, orange, yellow, and green, whereas those that improved binding, presumably by eliminating a negative effect, are depicted in light blue andblue. The residues that most affected A1 binding (Lys224, Asp241, and Arg239) form a contiguous patch on the surface of the molecule (Fig. 4a). Residues Asp229, Ser236, and Thr238neighbor this region, and it is straightforward to imagine that the antibody-combining site of A1 could overlay this set of residues on one monomer of the Ly49A homodimer. A1 is an alloantibody raised in BALB/c mice against Ly49AC57BL/6 (29Nagasawa R. Gross J. Kanagawa O. Townsend K. Lanier L.L. Chiller J. Allison J.P. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 815-824Google Scholar). Allelic differences between Ly49ABALB/c and Ly49AC57BL/6 in the region where the Ly49AC57BL/6 structure is known are at positions 187 and 238 (where Ly49AC57BL/6 has Gln and Thr, respectively, and Ly49ABALB/c has His and Ile). Residue 187 lies adjacent to residue 238 on the surface of Ly49A. In contrast to those residues in which mutation adversely affected the binding of A1, mutants N203A, Q247A, V248A, and F249A improved binding by A1. The binding of three other antibodies, YE1/48, YE1/32, and JR9-318, to the panel of mutants reveals different characteristics. The only mutation that adversely affects binding of YE1/48 is K224A (Fig.4c); YE1/32 is most affected by D246A (Fig. 4d); and JR9-318 is most dependent on K224 (Fig. 4f). These results suggest that YE1/32 interacts more with residues on the “side” of the Ly49A molecule than with those on the “top.” The surface region that most affects H-2Dd binding is a large area that extends from Asp246 across the top of the molecule that includes Gln247, Val248, and Phe249 as well as a distinct surface consisting of Asp229, Ser236, Thr238, Arg239, Asp241, and Asn242 (Fig. 4,b and e). In addition to the adverse effects of mutation of any of the residues in this patch, mutation of Asn203 and Lys224 to alanine improves the binding to H-2Dd molecules. Thus, the focus of H-2Dd binding is on Arg239 and the surrounding residues located along the top of Ly49A. Although the behavior of Ly49A mutants S236A, T238A, and R239A strongly suggested that Site 2 was the major focus of the Ly49A/H-2Dd interaction, other data, including the analysis of polymorphic MHC-I residues in different mouse strains and the behavior of a single H-2Dd mutation of I52M, had suggested that Site 1 was important (10Chung D.H. Natarajan K. Boyd L.F. Tormo J. Mariuzza R.A. Yokoyama W.M. Margulies D.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6922-6932Google Scholar). To clarify this issue, we tabulated the number of atomic contacts between those residues that seemed to be most involved in binding to H-2Dd (TableI). We looked closely at the contacts made by Ly49A residues Asp229, Ser236, Thr238, Arg239, Asp241, Asn242, Gln247, Val248, and Phe249 at either Site 1 or Site 2. For Site 1 contacts, Gln247, Val248, and Phe249 made 18 atomic contacts with residue Gln54 of H-2Dd, and residue Asp229 made 10 contacts with H-2Ddresidue Arg169. For Site 2 contacts, the greatest number (23Michaelsson J. Achour A. Rolle A. Kärre K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7327-7334Google Scholar) were made by Ly49A residues Ser236, Thr238, and Arg239 to Asp122 of H-2Dd. These contacts are specifically between the “F” subunit of Ly49A and H-2Dd. Ly49A residues Thr238, Arg239, and Asp241 are ambiguous, however, in that those residues in the “E” subunit (Fig.1a and Table I) also make contact with H-2Ddresidues Tyr85 (8Kane K.P. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1011-1015Google Scholar) and Asn86 (10Chung D.H. Natarajan K. Boyd L.F. Tormo J. Mariuzza R.A. Yokoyama W.M. Margulies D.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6922-6932Google Scholar). Residues Gln247, Val248, and Phe249 of Ly49A made 21 contacts with β2m residue Gln29; and residues Asp229, Arg239, Asp241, and Asn242 of Ly49A made 20 contacts with β2m residue Lys58.Table IAtomic contacts between Ly49A and H-2Dd residuesLy49A residue1-aUppercase letters represent the different domains of the MHC·Ly49A complex: A = H-2Dd; B = mouse β2m; C, D, E, and F = Ly49A monomer.

Open table in a new tab The number of atomic contacts between the indicated amino acids was tabulated from the crystal structure of Ly49A·H-2Dd using QUANTA 2000 (Molecular Simulation, Inc.). To test the contribution to binding of these potential contact regions, we produced alanine mutations at all seven positions: two at Site 1 of the H-2Dd heavy chain (Q54A and R169A); three at Site 2 (Y85A, N86A, and D122A); and two at the β2m contact (Q29A and K58A). In addition, a non-contact mutant in H-2Dd, S246A, was generated as a control. Each of these eight mutants in parallel with a parental H-2Dd·motif peptide complex was tested by surface plasmon resonance for binding to Ly49A. The sensorgrams and the steady state levels of binding are plotted as a function of analyte concentration in Fig.5. The mutational analysis of H-2Dd and β2m clearly implicates Site 2 as the major determinant of the Ly49A·H-2Dd binding interaction: H-2Dd mutant D122A and β2m mutants Q29A and K58A had profound effects on binding to Ly49A. (In addition, these two β2m mutants exerted no effect on the binding of a β2m-dependent mAb, S19.8, over a wide range of concentration. S19.8 also showed concentration-dependent inhibition of binding of H-2Dd to Ly49A even when the H-2Dd was complexed with either of the two β2m mutants (data not shown).) In contrast to the effects of Site 2 mutants of H-2Dd, those at Site 1, Q54A and R169A, showed little effect on binding. Two mutants at the periphery of Site 2, Y85A and N86A, and the S246A control showed only a small quantitative effect. Although H-2Dd mutant D122A and β2m mutants Q29A and K58A severely reduced binding to Ly49A, they retained the ability to bind to H-2Dd-specific mAbs 34-35-8 and 34-2-12 (data not shown). To eliminate the possibility that these mutations may have distorted either the peptide binding site or the TCR binding site of the molecule, we tested their ability to interact with both an H-2Dd/Pro18-Ile10-restricted specific recombinant scTCR and with an MHC-restricted, peptide-specific mAb, KP15 (38Polakova K. Plaksin D. Chung D.H. Belyakov I.M. Berzofsky J.A. Margulies D.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5703-5712Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, the three mutants and the parental H-2Dd/Pro18-Ile10 bind both the scTCR and KP15 equivalently. These results reinforce the view that the Ly49A binding site on H-2Dd is distinct from that of the TCR. To explain the profound effects exerted by mutation of H-2Dd D122A, as well as β2m Q29A and K58A, we returned to a close inspection of the interface of H-2Ddwith Ly49A at Site 2 (Fig. 7). In particular, we have included the water molecules at this interface. The region that surrounds residue Asp122 of H-2Ddreveals not only the proximity of the side chains of residues Ser236, Thr238, and Arg239 of Ly49A but also at least seven water molecules that are involved in this interface (Fig. 7b). The β2m residue Lys58, which is highly conserved among species, interacts with Asp229, Asp241, and Asn242 of Ly49A amid a network of water molecules that also coordinate with the side chain of H-2Dd residue Arg6 as well as Arg239 (Fig. 7c). Continuing this general trend, β2m residue Gln29 (the Gln is unique to mouse β2m) not only interacts with its contact residues Gln247, Val248, and Phe249 on Ly49A but also interacts with a number of waters in this vicinity (Fig.7d). Our mutational analysis of the binding of Ly49A, H-2Dd, and β2m mutants leads to two major conclusions: that the primary binding site of H-2Ddemployed by Ly49A is at Site 2, a large surface area that involves contacts from the floor of the peptide-binding groove of the MHC-I and residues from β2m; and that integrity of the Ly49A homodimer is critical for preservation of MHC-I binding. The effect of mutation of the homodimeric interface residues Tyr142, Trp143, Tyr146, and Val189 in reducing binding to H-2Dd as well as the augmentation of binding by mutations of Phe144 and Leu188 suggest that the structure of the surface that c"

Poxviruses encode a secreted chemokine binding protein, viral CC chemokine inhibitor (vCCI),1 which likely represents one such mechanism, allowing the virus to achieve a molecular preemption of the primary immune response. Also known as “T1” (in leporipoxviruses) or “35 kDa” (in orthopoxviruses), vCCI has been shown to bind to several human chemokines, but it possesses no close molecular similarity to any endogenous proteins (2Carfi A.

Because chemokines (for chemoattractant cytokines) are secreted proteins that serve to direct the trafficking of leukocytes during the body's response to infection and inflammation, the sequestration of chemokines by poxviruses may serve an anti-inflammatory function that is advantageous to the virus.

Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3289) Google Scholar). These are divided into four classes, CC, CXC, C, and CX3C, based on the number and spacing of the N-terminal cysteine residues in a conserved structural motif. In addition, several viruses are known to make their own versions of chemokines. These include vMIP-I, -II, and -III (3Boshoff C. Endo Y. Collins P.D. Takeuchi Y. Reeves J.D. Schweickart V.L.

For example, initially vCCI was thought to interact broadly with CC and CXC chemokines (20Graham K.A. Lalani A.S. Macen J.L. Ness T.L. Barry M. Liu L.Y. Lucas A. Clark-Lewis I. Moyer R.W. McFadden G. Virology. 1997; 229: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); however, others (22Lalani A.S. Ness T.L. Singh R. Harrison J.K. Seet B.T. Kelvin D.J. McFadden G. Moyer R.W.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 624-633PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested a pattern of selectivity for CC chemokines. Additionally, vastly disparate binding affinities have been reported for the same chemokines ranging from low micromolar to low nanomolar values (20Graham K.A. Lalani A.S. Macen J.L. Ness T.L. Barry M. Liu L.Y. Lucas A. Clark-Lewis I. Moyer R.W. McFadden G. Virology. 1997; 229: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 22Lalani A.S. Ness T.L. Singh R. Harrison J.K. Seet B.T.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 624-633PubMed Google Scholar). This may be due in part to the diverse methods of binding analyses employed. To date there have been no studies attempting a comprehensive, direct, and real-time comparison of the binding of many chemokines to vCCI under similar analytical conditions. To gain a thorough understanding of the biology of vCCI and its role in viral pathogenesis, we undertook to map comprehensively its binding capacity and to investigate in detail the nature of its multipotential binding activity. Toward this end, we employed the parallel interrogation of >80 chemokines and chemokine variants from human and viral sequences as well as those from other species, assessing their ability to bind to vCCI. We found that vCCI is capable of binding with high affinity (Kd ∼5–55 nm) to a spectrum of ligands more wide ranging than previously reported. These include chemokines encoded by other types of viruses as well. The ligand binding profile determined here also reveals that vCCI does not bind to all CC chemokines, nor does it interact with members of the CXC, C, or CX3C groups. Finally we noted examples of unusual binding interactions between vCCI and selected chemokines, suggesting that vCCI interacts with different chemokines through similar yet distinct binding sites. Such findings illuminate not only the biochemical characteristics of this unusual virally encoded binding protein but also may provide key insights into the virus's ability to evade the host immune response after infection. We employed a variation of the recently developed DisplaceMax™ technique (6Dairaghi D.J. Fan R.A. McMaster B.E. Hanley M.R. Schall T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21569-21574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 24Gosling J. Dairaghi D.J. Wang Y. Hanley M. Talbot D. Miao Z. Schall T.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2851-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) to interrogate an array of chemokine interactions with vCCI and to examine specific binding characteristics. These assays exploit the observation that vCCI binds to the filter in radioligand filter binding assays. By including a radiolabeled chemokine that interacts with vCCI it is then possible to detect vCCI binding to the filter. Chemokines that compete for this binding then prevent vCCI-125I chemokine complexes from forming, and thus the decreasing cpm on the filter indicates competitor chemokine bound to vCCI displacing the 125I chemokine. Eighty-three distinct chemokine elements were incubated with 25 nm vCCI (R&D Systems) followed by the addition of radiolabeled chemokine (125I-labeled human eotaxin,125I-hMIP-1α, and 125I-hMIP-1β, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 3 h at 4 °C in the following binding medium (25 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, adjusted to pH 7.1). Where indicated, the detergents Tween 20 (Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc.) and Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad) were included in the reaction at the indicated final concentrations. (Because of the addition of high levels of detergent in the binding medium, the ability to detect input cpm and total cpm bound differs for this adaptation of the binding assay slightly as follows: Tween 20 1%: ∼49,000 cpm input, ∼14,000 cpm total bound, ∼775 cpm nonspecific bound; Tween 20 0.1%: ∼63,000 cpm input, ∼14,000 cpm total bound, ∼550 cpm nonspecific bound; Tween 20 0.01%: ∼60,000 cpm input, ∼16,000 cpm total bound, ∼765 cpm nonspecific bound; Triton X-100 1%: ∼54,000 cpm input, ∼19,000 cpm total bound, ∼650 cpm nonspecific bound; Triton X-100 0.1%: ∼62,000 cpm input, ∼11,000 cpm total bound, ∼600 cpm nonspecific bound; Triton X-100 0.01%: ∼59,000 cpm input, ∼9,600 cpm total bound, ∼650 cpm nonspecific bound; binding medium only: ∼51,000 cpm input, ∼18,000 cpm total bound, ∼1000 cpm nonspecific bound.) Following incubation in all binding assays, reactions were aspirated onto polyethyleneimine-treated GF/B glass filters (Packard) using a cell harvester (Packard) and washed twice (25 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, adjusted to pH 7.1). Scintillant (MicroScint 10, Packard) was added to the wells, and the filters were counted in a Packard Topcount scintillation counter. Data were analyzed and plotted using Prism (GraphPad Prism, version 3.0a, for Macintosh, GraphPad Software). A more thorough understanding of the chemokine binding profile of vCCI could ultimately provide insight into the biologic function of this protein in the in vivo setting. As a first approximation, we examined the chemokine binding profile of the poxvirus-encoded vCCI in an assumption-blind manner. We tested a starting panel of >80 purified chemokine elements and compared their ability to displace selected “signature” chemokines, such as 125I-hMIP-1β, from vCCI in a filtration-based assay. As many as 26 chemokines, when used as cold competitors (at 200 nm final concentration), were found to inhibit >60% of the specific binding of the radiolabeled signature chemokine to vCCI (Fig. 1). The spectrum of ligands that bound to vCCI included many interactions not reported previously. For example, multiple forms of the CC chemokine hMPIF-1 (25Macphee C.H. Appelbaum E.R. Johanson K. Moores K.E. Imburgia C.S. Fornwald J. Berkhout T. Brawner M. Groot P.H. O'Donnell K. O'Shannessy D. Scott G. White J.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6273-6279PubMed Google Scholar, 26Berkhout T.A. Gohil J.

Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), including splice variants that possess an additional coded exon (17Youn B.S. Zhang S.M. Broxmeyer H.E. Cooper S. Antol K. Fraser Jr., M. Kwon B.S. Blood. 1998; 91: 3118-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), bound to vCCI. Also, two herpesvirus-encoded chemokines, HHV8 vMIP-I and HHV8 vMIP-II, were very effective in displacing the signature chemokine from vCCI. Although most CC chemokines exhibited binding to vCCI, a few CC chemokines, such as hMDC, hTARC, and hTECK, did not. Qualitatively similar results were seen with another signature chemokine, 125I-hMIP-1α. In no case have we detected evidence of vCCI binding to CXC, C, or CX3C chemokines. We wished to investigate in greater detail the nature of the binding interactions of vCCI with the potential high affinity ligands suggested from the displacement binding fingerprint. Initial investigations employed homologous competition binding experiments with selected radiolabeled chemokines. Representative experiments tested whether radiolabeled human eotaxin or radiolabeled hMIP-1α would be displaced from vCCI over a concentration range of cold homologous competitor to assess: (i) the relative binding affinities (as approximated by IC50 values) and (ii) the slope (Hill coefficient) of the binding displacement curves. It has been established that the Hill coefficients reveal something of the biophysical nature of receptor-ligand interactions (24Gosling J. Dairaghi D.J. Wang Y. Hanley M. Talbot D. Miao Z. Schall T.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2851-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), where a Hill number of ∼1 implies a single binding site with a simple mass action displacement. Hill values >1 are indicative of cooperative binding, and Hill values <1 suggest negative cooperativity. Homologous displacement with the chemokines tested revealed a range of distinct interactions. For example, homologous displacement of125I-labeled human eotaxin from vCCI with cold human eotaxin (Fig. 2A) revealed an IC50 of ∼32 nm and a Hill coefficient of 1.2 (see Table I). This was in marked contrast to the interactions of 125I-hMIP-1α; whereas competition for vCCI binding with cold hMIP-1α showed a nearly identical IC50 (∼32 nm), the binding displacement curve had a precipitous slope, with a very large Hill coefficient (Fig. 2B and Table I). Thus, although these two chemokines seem to bind to vCCI with similar affinities, eotaxin seems to associate with simple one-site kinetics, whereas hMIP-1α displayed potentially marked positive cooperativity.Table ISummary of vCCI-chemokine binding interactionsIC50Hill coefficientnmHomologous competition125I-hMIP-1α/hMIP-1α32>4.0125I-human eotaxin/human eotaxin321.2Heterologous competition High affinity125I-hMIP-1α/vMIP-II26>4.0125I-hMIP-1β/hMIP-1α23>4.0125I-hMIP-1β/hMPIF40>4.0125I-hMIP-1β/mMCP-1/JE32>4.0125I-human eotaxin/hMIP-1α8>4.0125I-human eotaxin/vMIP-II152.8125I-human eotaxin/rMIP-3α461.7125I-human eotaxin/hSLC171.4 Lower affinity125I-hMIP-1α/hMPIF753.3125I-hMIP-1β/vMIP-II502.8125I-hMIP-1β/rMIP-3α1301.5125I-human eotaxin/hMCP-11470.4 Open table in a new tab In addition to examining homologous binding competition, heterologous binding interactions were examined. For example, we assessed the susceptibility of 125I-human eotaxin to displacement by several other chemokines that appeared to be interacting with vCCI at high affinity (as suggested from the displacement fingerprint (Fig. 1)). Cold heterologous competitors tested included HHV8 vMIP-II (Fig.3A), hSLC (Fig.3B), and hMCP-1 (Fig. 3C). Strikingly, despite the fact that in each case 125I-human eotaxin is displaced by the cold competitors, the slope of the dissociation curve is markedly different depending upon the competitor used. Indeed some ligands demonstrate a “catastrophic” dissociation profile. For example, the displacement of 125I-human eotaxin by HHV8 vMIP-II (Fig. 3A) reveals a very sharp dissociation profile, with all of the human eotaxin displaced over a very small concentration range of HHV8 vMIP-II. In contrast, the competition of125I-human eotaxin by hMCP-1 or hSLC reveals a substantially different slope of the resultant binding curves. Table Isummarizes both IC50 values and approximate Hill coefficients for both homologous and heterologous competition experiments. In particular the wide range of Hill coefficients over the course of the various experiments suggest that vCCI bound to its broad spectrum of chemokines with overlapping but distinct characteristics. To test whether the high Hill coefficients seen in some of the displacement experiments reflect the formation of vCCI aggregates or micelle-like structures, different detergent conditions were assessed in the binding reaction. The addition of non-ionic detergents such as Tween 20 (1–0.01%) had no effect on the slope of the binding curve (Fig.4, A and C). Triton X-100 did have some effect in altering the slope of the curve when added to the binding buffer at concentrations of 1 and 0.1%; however, the slopes remain steep with Hill coefficients > 1.5 (Fig. 4,B and C). These data suggest that vCCI exhibits very strong cooperative binding with a select group of chemokines, and this cooperative binding is not disrupted by the addition of detergents. In conclusion, we have developed a broad and comprehensive vCCI binding profile allowing us to characterize vCCI-chemokine interactions. Unlike other binding analyses, we endeavored to use a more native form of vCCI (e.g. not tethered through an epitopic tag), and we employed a filtration assay that allowed the proteins to interact without interference by other cellular factors. The binding fingerprint developed from our studies suggests that vCCI is promiscuous, but not ubiquitous, in its binding of chemokines. Twenty-six of the >80 chemokine elements tested were identified as potential high affinity vCCI ligands. Further investigation of these binding interactions suggests that vCCI binds chemokines with overlapping but distinct sites. The finding that several but not all chemokines tested had unusually steep binding slopes supports this concept. The combination of such unusual binding and displacement characteristics suggests that the virus has developed an adaptation to capture and sequester many chemokines in the frame of limited protein topography. The selectivity for certain CC chemokines by vCCI and the distinct binding interactions with a subset of these proteins indicate that the virus has adapted a function to alter its environment to the specific needs of the virus. Collectively, these data suggest that vCCI may serve not so much as a sink for certain chemokines in the local environment but as a dynamic and selective molecular switch that has evolved different strategies to regulate the local concentration of a diverse spectrum of chemokines."
https://openalex.org/W2083720922,"Although the involvement of the nonvisual arrestins in the agonist-induced internalization of the human lutropin receptor (hLHR) has been documented previously with the use of dominant-negative mutants, a physical association of the nonvisual arrestins with the hLHR in intact cells has not been established. In the studies presented herein, we used a cross-linking/coimmunoprecipitation/immunoblotting approach as well as confocal microscopy to document the association of the hLHR with the nonvisual arrestins in co-transfected 293 cells. We also used this approach to examine the relative importance of receptor activation and receptor phosphorylation in the formation of this complex. Using hLHR mutants that impair phosphorylation, activation, or both, we show that the formation of the hLHR-nonvisual arrestin complex depends mostly on the agonist-induced activation of the hLHR rather than on the phosphorylation of the hLHR. These results stand in contrast to those obtained with several other G protein-coupled receptors (i.e. the β2-adrenergic receptor, the m2 muscarinic receptor, rhodopsin, and the type 1A angiotensin receptor) where arrestin binding depends mostly on receptor phosphorylation rather than on receptor activation. We have also examined the association of the nonvisual arrestins with naturally occurring gain-of-function mutations of the hLHR found in boys with Leydig cell hyperplasia or Leydig cell adenomas.

The nonvisual arrestins (arrestin-2 also known as β-arrestin-1 and arrestin-3, also known as β-arrestin-2) bind with high affinity to clathrin and to adaptor protein-2 (5Goodman J.O.B. Krupnick J.G.

Once localized to clathrin-coated pits, the GPCRs are internalized by a process that requires the participation of dynamin, a GTPase involved in the fission of clathrin-coated pits (7Warnock D.

Although the large number of studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor emphasize the importance of GPCR phosphorylation on the process of internalization (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar, 2Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin.

Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar), our recent mutagenesis studies with the human (h) LHR suggest that the agonist-induced internalization of this receptor is much more dependent on receptor activation than on receptor phosphorylation (12Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,13Li S. Liu X. Min L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7968-7973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the following findings. First, an activation-competent but phosphorylation-impaired mutant of the hLHR (constructed by mutation of the phosphorylation sites) lengthens thet½ of internalization of the hLHR less than 2-fold (12Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Second, two mutations of the second extracellular loop (S512A and V519A) that cause a slight impairment in receptor activation (i.e. a 2–3-fold rightward shift in the EC50for cAMP accumulation) lengthen the t½ of internalization 5–7-fold without affecting receptor phosphorylation (13Li S. Liu X. Min L. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7968-7973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Third, two other mutants of the hLHR (D405N and Y546F in transmembrane helices 2 and 5, respectively) that cause a more severe impairment in receptor activation (i.e. a 10–50-fold rightward shift in the EC50 for cAMP accumulation) become resistant to agonist-induced phosphorylation but still lengthen thet½ of internalization 5–7-fold (12Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the phosphorylation of the D405N and Y546F mutants and their long t½ of internalization can be rescued by overexpression of GRK2 but only if the phosphorylation sites are intact. Because dominant-negative mutants of the nonvisual arrestins inhibit the agonist-induced internalization of the hLHR, we hypothesized that the different manipulations described above affected internalization by affecting the association of the hLHR with the nonvisual arrestins. The studies presented here describe a method that can be used to measure the formation of the nonvisual arrestin-hLHR complex and use this method to formally test the hypothesis proposed above. The preparation and properties of a hLHR-wt expression vector modified with the Myc epitope at the N terminus has been described (12Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). All hLHR mutants used here were prepared using this vector as template. The preparation, signaling properties, and internalization properties of all these mutants have also been described (12Min L. Ascoli M. Mol.

Expression vectors for arrestin-2, arrestin-3, a β2-adrenergic receptor tagged with the HA epitope at the N terminus (in pcDNA3.1), and arrestin-3 tagged with GFP at the C terminus (in pEGFP-N1) were kindly provided by Dr. Jeff Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). The nonvisual arrestins were modified (using PCR strategies) with the FLAG epitope at the N terminus and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 for expression. Co-transfection experiments revealed that the FLAG-tagged nonvisual arrestin constructs were as effective as their wild-type counterparts in enhancing the internalization of the hLHR-wt. A full-length clone encoding for bovine GRK2 (14Benovic J.L. DeBlasi A. Stone C.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

An expression vector (pcDNA1.1) encoding for a prenylated, kinase-deficient, mutant of GRK2, designated C20-GRK2-K220M, (16Ferguson S.S.G. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A.-M. Caron M.G.

Transient transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method of Chen and Okayama (17Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in gelatin-coated plasticware and transfected when 70–80% confluent with the amounts of plasmid DNA indicated in the figure legends. After an overnight incubation, the cells were washed and used 24 h later. Cells were plated and transfected in 100-mm dishes (in 10 ml of medium) that had been coated with gelatin. At the end of the transfection, the cells were washed, trypsinized, plated in gelatin-coated 100-mm dishes and in gelatin-coated 35-mm wells, and used 24 h later. The cells plated in 35-mm wells were used to assess125I-hCG binding and internalization. The binding of125I-hCG was measured by incubating the transfected cells with a saturating concentration (∼25 nm) of125I-hCG for 1 h at room temperature. These results were used to ensure that the cells were expressing equivalent densities of cell surface receptors and to equalize the amount of receptor to be immunoprecipitated as described below. The internalization of125I-hCG was measured during a 50-min incubation of the cells with a concentration of hCG equivalent to theKd (∼ 2 nm) as described elsewhere (11Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 241-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

Rates of internalization can be calculated by plotting the internalization index (defined as the ratio of surface to internalized hormone) as a function of time (11Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 241-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

In all arrestin-3 binding experiments reported herein (using cells co-transfected with dynamin-K44A), the internalization indices for hCG in cells co-transfected with the hLHR-wt or mutants thereof were 0.05–0.1 when measured during a 50-min incubation. This low internalization index measured at this long incubation time is consistent with half-times of internalization in the 150–200-min range (11Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 241-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

These results were simply used to confirm that all cells co-transfected with dynamin-K44A were internalizing125I-hCG at a slow and comparable rate regardless of the receptor expressed or the amount of arrestin-3 transfected. The cells plated in the 100-mm dishes were used to measure arrestin-3 binding as follows. The monolayers were washed three times with warm 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (Buffer A). After addition of 3 ml of the same buffer, each dish received a 60-μl aliquot of vehicle or hCG to give a final concentration of ∼26 nm (the Kd for hCG binding is ∼2 nm; see Ref. 11Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 241-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated. At the end of this incubation, each dish received 150 μl of a freshly prepared 25 mm solution of dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) in Me2SO. The cross-linking reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature while the dishes were rocked (20Freedman N. Ament A. Oppermann M. Stoffel R. Exum S. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). After cross-linking the cells were placed on ice, the buffer was aspirated, and the monolayers were washed once with ice-cold Dulbecco's-modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm Hepes, 10% newborn calf serum, pH 7.4, and then incubated in 5 ml of the same medium for 5 min on ice. Finally, the monolayers were washed two more times with cold 0.15m NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and the cells were lysed during a 30-min incubation on ice with 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 4 mg/ml dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 0.8 mg/ml cholesteryl hemisuccinate in buffer A) supplemented with 40 μg/ml Complete®, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, and aliquots (∼500 μl) containing the same amount of receptor (calculated from the binding experiments done in parallel as described above) were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to the Myc epitope (9E10) that had been preabsorbed to agarose-conjugated protein G for 90–120 min at 4 °C as described previously (12Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After extensive washing the cross-linked complexes were reduced and eluted by vigorous mixing of the beads in SDS sample buffer with reducing agents for 15 min at room temperature. The eluted material was then resolved on SDS gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described elsewhere (21Quintana J. Hipkin R.W. Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2098-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged nonvisual arrestins were visualized in the blots during a 1-h incubation with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody covalently coupled to horseradish peroxidase used at a final dilution of 1:500. The presence of equal amounts of receptor in the immunoprecipitates was confirmed by developing the blots with an anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal antibody covalently coupled to horseradish peroxidase used at a final dilution of 1:1000 (this is documented only in Fig. 3). In experiments that utilized GRK2 co-transfections, the transfected GRK2 was visualized with a commercially available primary antibody (C-15 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as described previously (22Lazari M.F.M. Liu X. Nakamura K. Benovic J.L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 866-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In some experiments (cf. Fig. 2), the endogenous and/or transfected arrestin-3 were visualized using a 1:2000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein containing residues 350–409 of bovine arrestin-3 (23Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34616-34622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In all of these cases, the appropriate secondary antibodies covalently coupled to horseradish peroxidase were used at a 1:5000 dilution. All immune complexes were ultimately visualized and quantitated using the Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity system of detection from Pierce and a Kodak digital imaging system. This image capture system is set up to alert us when image saturation occurs and to prevent us from measuring the intensity of such images.Figure 2Agonist-dependent association of the Myc-hLHR-wt with FLAG-arrestin-3 in intact cells expressing increasing amounts of FLAG-arrestin-3.Panels A andB, 293T cells (plated in 100-mm dishes) were transiently co-transfected with a constant amount of Myc-hLHR-wt (10 μg/dish) and dynamin-K44A (2.5 μg/dish) plus the indicated amounts of FLAG-arrestin-3. The transfected cells were washed and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C without or with 26 nm hCG as indicated prior to cross-linking and immunoprecipitation. The results presented show the relevant areas of the blots of a representative experiment in which aliquots of the different lysates (∼18 μl of lysate forpanel A and ∼ 500 μl of lysate for panel B) containing equivalent amounts of receptor (measured by125I-hCG binding as described under “Materials and Methods”) were used to measure the total amount of FLAG-arrestin-3 expressed (panel A) or the amount of FLAG-arrestin-3 immunoprecipitated with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (panel B) as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and under “Materials and Methods.” The arrows show the amount of FLAG-arrestin-3 used for transfections in the experiments summarized in Figs. 5, 6, 8, and 9. Panel C, a polyclonal antibody to arrestin-3 (23Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34616-34622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) followed by a secondary antibody covalently labeled with horseradish peroxidase were used to reveal the amount of arrestin-3 present in serial dilutions of the lysates of untransfected 293T cells and of the cells shown in panels A and B that were transfected with 0.03 μg of FLAG-arrestin-3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 293T cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and cotransfected as described above with 10 μg of HA-tagged β2AR, 2.5 μg of dynamin-K44A, 0.25 μg of FLAG-arrestin-3, and 5 μg of empty vector or 5 μg of C20-GRK2-K220M. The transiently transfected cells were washed with the buffers described above and incubated with or without 10 μm isoproterenol for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were then cross-linked and lysed as described above, except that radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors was used. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and aliquots (∼500 μl) containing the same amount of protein were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope (3F10, 1.5 μg/sample) that had been preabsorbed to agarose-conjugated protein G for 90–120 min at 4 °C as described above. The rest of this procedure was done exactly as described above for the hLHR. The co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-arrestin-3 and the HA-tagged β2AR were visualized in the blots during a 1-h incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (final dilution = 1:500) or a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA (3F10) monoclonal antibody (final concentration = 25 milliunits/ml). Expression of the transfected C20-GRK2-K220M was monitored using a monoclonal antibody to GRK2 (3A10 from Jeff Benovic), followed by a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. All immune complexes were ultimately visualized and quantitated using the Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity system of detection from Pierce and a Kodak digital imaging system. This image capture system is set up to alert us when image saturation occurs and to prevent us from measuring the intensity of such images. Cells were plated in eight-chamber coverslip culture vessels coated with polylysine (BioCoat from Becton-Dickinson). They were co-transfected (in a total volume of 400 μl) with 400 ng of Myc-hLHR, 100 ng of dynamin-K44A, and 8 ng of arrestin-3-GFP using the methods described above. Two days after transfection, the cells were incubated with or without hCG for 30 min at 37 °C as described above for the arrestin-3 binding assays. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 1.4 mm NaH2PO4, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) and fixed during a 30-min incubation at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde (dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline). The fixed cells were washed twice again and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. This solution was removed, and the cells were incubated for another h at room temperature with a 1:100 dilution of the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated for another 1 h at room temperature with a 1:2000 dilution of rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse IgG. Finally they were washed three or four times with phosphate-buffered saline, dried, and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). The rhodamine-labeled hLHR and the arrestin-3-GFP were visualized with a Bio-Rad confocal microscope at the Central Microscopy Facility of the University of Iowa. Human kidney 293T cells are a derivative of 293 cells that express the SV40T antigen (24Margolskee R. McHenry-Rinde B. Horn R.

Puett D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Partially purified hCG (∼3,000 IU/mg) was purchased from Sigma, and it was used only for the determination of nonspecific binding (see above). 125I-cAMP and cell culture medium were obtained from the Iodination Core and the Media and Cell Production Core, respectively, of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center of the University of Iowa. Concentrated supernatant from the 9E10 cells was prepared by the Hybridoma Facility of the Cancer Center of the University of Iowa. The 9E10 and anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Sigma, respectively. The 3F10 monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope (native or coupled to horseradish peroxidase) were from Roche. Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase or rhodamine were from Bio-Rad and Sigma, respectively. Other cell culture supplies and reagents were obtained from Corning and Invitrogen, respectively. All other chemicals were obtained from commonly used suppliers. The association of several GPCR binding partners such as GRKs and nonvisual arrestins in intact cells has been difficult to assess using standard immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting approaches but can be readily determined if the complexes are cross-linked prior to immunoprecipitation (20Freedman N.

We encountered the same difficulties in experiments attempting to ascertain the association of the hLHR with the nonvisual arrestins in co-transfected 293T cells, and the only way to reliably detect such complexes was to treat the cells with DSP, a cell-permeable, homobifunctional, cleavable cross-linking agent, prior to immunoprecipitation. Thus, the basic method used below to detect the association of the hLHR with the nonvisual arrestins consisted of co-transfecting 293T cells with a Myc-tagged hLHR (12Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and one of the FLAG-tagged nonvisual arrestins. Following incubation with or without agonist, the cells were further incubated with DSP (20Freedman N. Ament A. Oppermann M. Stoffel R. Exum S. Lefkowitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17734-17743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) prior to solubilization. The cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to the Myc epitope (9E10), and the cross-linked complexes were dissociated by incubation of the immunoprecipitates with SDS sample buffer containing reducing agents. The reduced complexes were then resolved on SDS gels, blotted, and probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody to the FLAG epitope (M2) to detect the FLAG-tagged nonvisual arrestins co-immunoprecipitated with the hLHR. Fig. 1 shows that the association of the Myc-hLHR-wt with FLAG-arrestin-3 is minimally detectable in unstimulated cells. When exposed to hCG, however, there is a quick and robust association of these two components. A steady state level of association was attained during a 20–30-min incubation with a saturating concentration of hCG. When the same experiment was done in cells co-transfected with dynamin-K44A (a condition that blocks the agonist-induced internalization of the hLHR; see Refs. 11Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

In several experiments similar to that shown in Fig. 1, the amount of FLAG-arrestin-3·Myc-hLHR-wt complex formed (quantitated as described under “Materials and Methods”) during 30 min with hCG increased 4–10-fold and 20–50-fold in cells co-transfected without or with dynamin-K44A, respectively. Because the aim of the experiments presented here was to compare the association of the nonvisual arrestins with mutants of the hLHR that are internalized at different rates, we wanted to ensure that changes in the formation of the receptor-arrestin-3 complexes we"

One C3 fragment, C3a, is an anaphylactic agent, while the other fragment, C3b, binds covalently to activating targets, marking foreign substances for lysis and/or immune clearance and participating in the selection of and enhancement of the antibody repertoire (2Fearon D.T. Locksley R.M. Science. 1996; 272: 50-54Google Scholar, 3Carroll M.C. Prodeus A.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 36-40Google Scholar, 4Nielsen C.H. Rischer E.M. Leslie R.G.Q. Immunology. 2000; 100: 4-12Google Scholar). The AP C3 convertase is assembled in two steps. First, C3b associates in the presence of divalent cation (Mg2+) with factor B, a zymogen that carries the convertase serine protease domain. Second, the C3bB(Mg2+) complex is cleaved by the serum protease factor D at a single site in factor B, producing Ba and Bb fragments. The Ba fragment dissociates from the complex, while Bb remains bound to C3b and Mg2+ to form the active C3 convertase, C3bBb(Mg2+). A similar process occurs in the assembly of the classical and lectin pathway C3 convertase, C4b2a(Mg2+), a complex which is structurally and functionally homologous to the AP C3 convertase. Activation of human C3 is regulated by a family of related proteins termed the regulators of complement activation (RCA) (5Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 149-166Google Scholar, 6Ahearn J.M. Rosengard A.M. Volanakis J.E. Frank M.M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 167-202Google Scholar, 7Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. Prog. Immunol. 1989; 7: 171-177Google Scholar). The RCA proteins control complement activation by virtue of two different activities. 1) RCA proteins can promote the irreversible dissociation of complement convertases. 2) RCA proteins can serve as cofactors in the factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and C4b. The AP C3 convertase, C3bBb(Mg2+), is subject to decay acceleration by three RCA proteins: DAF, factor H, and CR1. These three regulators, like all other RCA proteins, are composed of arrays of tandem globular domains termed CCPs (complement control protein repeats) or SCRs (short consensus repeats). Only a portion of each protein is necessary and sufficient for decay acceleration of C3bBb(Mg2+): CCPs 2–4 of DAF (8Brodbeck W.G. Liu D. Sperry J. Mold C. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2528-2533Google Scholar), CCPs 1–3 of CR1 (9Krych M. Hauhart R. Atkinson J.P. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33Google Scholar), and CCPs 1–4 of factor H (10Kuhn S. Zipfel P.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2383-2387Google Scholar). While the mechanism of decay acceleration is largely unknown, previous studies have indicated that DAF may interact with the Bb subunit during this process (11Pangburn M.K. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 2216-2221Google Scholar). In addition, it has been postulated that a positively charged surface area in DAF CCP 2 and CCP 3 is the primary C3 convertase recognition area (12Kuttner-Kondo L. Medof M.E. Brodbeck W. Shoham M. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1143-1149Google Scholar). Here, we sought to elucidate the mechanism of AP C3 convertase decay acceleration by mapping sites on the Bb subunit critical to decay acceleration. We previously developed a simple ELISA method for the investigation of decay acceleration of the AP C3 convertase (13Hourcade D. Medof M.E. Brodbeck W. Wagner L.M. Oglesby T.J. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 57Google Scholar). In this report we describe a panel of Bb mutations, their assembly into mutant C3bBb complexes, and the decay acceleration of these complexes by DAF, CR1, and factor H. Interpretation of the results with a structural model of the factor B type A domain implicates two Bb sites critical to DAF and CR1 mediated decay acceleration, one of which is not critical to factor H-mediated decay acceleration. The transient expression of mutant and wild type factor B proteins was conducted with a human factor B cDNA in pSG5 vector using human 293T kidney cells in serum-free medium (14Hourcade D.E. Wagner L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19716-19722Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into the factor B clone using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). Each mutant was assayed for its capacity to participate in C3bBb assembly by three assays. 1) A fluid phase assay was used to examine the C3b- and factor D-dependent cleavage of factor B (15Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25996-26000Google Scholar). 2) An ELISA-based assay monitored the generation of C3bBb(Ni2+) complexes. In this assay microtiter wells were coated with C3b (3 μg/ml), blocked, and then incubated for 2 h in the presence of factor D (25 ng/ml), 2 mmNiCl2, 25 mm NaCl, and phosphate buffer supplemented with 4% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 with mutant factor B (usually 400 ng/ml) or wild type recombinant factor B (100, 200, 400, and 800 ng/ml); only 20 ng/ml was used for D254G, which binds C3b with greater affinity than wild type (16Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2906-2911Google Scholar). The microtiter wells were washed extensively and C3bBb(Ni2+) complexes detected by ELISA methods using polyclonal goat anti-human factor B antibody followed by peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-goat polyclonal antibody (14Hourcade D.E. Wagner L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19716-19722Google Scholar). Each reaction was performed in duplicate and the OD values averaged. The relationship between OD and factor B concentration calculated by regression analysis was used to derive the relative efficiency of each mutant factor B protein to form C3bBb(Ni2+). 3) A factor B-dependent hemolytic assay was used to assess overall function (14Hourcade D.E. Wagner L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19716-19722Google Scholar). The data shown are the results of 29 different experiments with an average of three mutants per experiment (Fig. 1). In each experiment C3bBb(Ni2+) was generated in microtiter wells coated with C3b (3 μg/ml), blocked, and then incubated for 2 h with mutant or wild type recombinant factor B (in most cases 400 ng/ml) in the presence of factor D (25 ng/ml), 2 mm NiCl2, 25 mm NaCl, and phosphate buffer supplemented with 4% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20, as above. The microtiter wells were washed extensively, and the plate-bound C3bBb(Ni2+) complexes were incubated for an additional 10, 20, and 30 min in the presence of DAF (25 ng/ml), CR1-A (see below) (50 ng/ml), factor H (500 ng/ml), or buffer supplemented with 4% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 alone. The remaining C3bBb(Ni2+) complexes were detected by ELISA as described above. Each reaction was performed in duplicate, and the two values averaged. The percent change in average OD at 30 min, which reflected loss of C3bBb(Ni2+) in buffer alone, was determined for each factor B form using the following equation: {[(OD0′buffer) − (OD30′ buffer)]/[(OD0′buffer) − (ODbgd)]}*100. ODbgd was the OD obtained at t = 0 when no factor B was included in the microtiter well. Analysis of the 10-min time point allowed the most sensitive comparison between the mutant and wild type factor B proteins, although analyses performed with the 20-min and 30-min time points yielded consistent results. The percent change in average OD at 10 min, which reflected loss of C3bBb(Ni2+) due to the presence of DAF (CR1-A or factor H), was determined for each factor B form using the following equation: {[(OD10′buffer) − (OD10′ DAF)]/[(OD10′buffer) − (ODbgd)]}*100. The pairwiset test was used to determine statistically significant differences between mutant and wild type proteins and, in some cases, between different mutant proteins. The activity of the mutants was normalized to the wild type values. By this assay the relative specific activities of the three regulatory protein were DAF, 100%; CR1-A, 88%; and factor H, 25%. Complement proteins factor D, C3b, and factor H were obtained from Advanced Research Technologies, La Jolla, CA. DAF consisted of a soluble derivative containing the 4 CCP active region with a single amino acid substitution (N61Q) that removed theN-linked oligosaccharide situated between CCP 1 and 2 (17Brodbeck W.G. Kuttner-Kondo L. Mold C. Medof M.E. Immunology. 2000; 101: 104-111Google Scholar,18Kuttner-Kondo L.A. Mitchell L. Hourcade D.E. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2164-2171Google Scholar). CR1-A is a soluble CR1 derivative, consisting of CCP 1–7 as previously described (19Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Google Scholar). The factor B type A domain model was constructed with the spatial coordinates of the iC3b receptor (CR3) type A domain (20Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Google Scholar), PDB entry 1IDO using the alignment provided by Hinshelwood et al. (21Hinshelwood J. Spencer D.I.R. Edwards Y.J.K. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 587-599Google Scholar), the automated program Modeler (22Sali A. Blundell T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Google Scholar), and the InsightII software platform, MSI. The Bb fragment consists essentially of two protein domains: a von Willibrand factor type A domain and a serine protease domain (23Mole J.E. Anderson J.K. Davison E.A. Woods D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3407-3412Google Scholar). From structural studies of type A domains of other proteins, the factor B type A domain is expected to be a globular structure composed of several parallel β sheets surrounded by seven α helices (20Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Google Scholar, 24Lee J.O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Google Scholar). The three-dimensional coordinates of the type A domain of factor B have not been reported although spatial models can be produced based on the three-dimensional coordinates of other type A domains (21Hinshelwood J. Spencer D.I.R. Edwards Y.J.K. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 587-599Google Scholar, 25Tuckwell D.S. Xu Y. Newham P. Humphries M.J. Volanakis J.E. Biochem. 1997; 36: 6605-6613Google Scholar). Thus, a spatial model was generated using the three-dimensional coordinates of the type A domain of CR3 that had been derived by x-ray crystallography. The CR3 domain was chosen because it binds the C3b derivative iC3b in the presence of Mg2+ (26Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Google Scholar). The model indicates that a divalent cation-binding site is located in a cleft at the apex of the domain, near several C3b-binding determinants (see “Discussion”), while the base of the domain likely adjoins the serine protease domain (Fig.2A). We constructed a panel of factor B type A mutants. Most mutations consisted of alanine substitutions for one or two charged or polar amino acids that are predicted to be on the protein's exterior. According to our model, the mutations were distributed over much of the type A domain surface (Fig. 2B). Among the recombinants produced were 31 mutant proteins that showed function in a factor D-dependent, divalent cation-dependent, C3b-binding assay and could be used to detect decay acceleration. Together, the mutations encompassed changes at 29 amino acid positions, including those of the two N-linked glycans. Each factor B mutation was examined for its effects on the decay acceleration activity of DAF; mutant and wild type C3bBb(Ni2+) complexes were generated in C3b-coated microtiter wells. The Ni2+ cation was used instead of Mg2+ to promote more stable C3bBb complexes and provide for greater signal. Complexes were then washed and treated for 10, 20, or 30 min with either DAF's functional CCPs 1–4 or buffer alone. C3bBb(Ni2+) complexes remaining were detected by ELISA using anti-human factor B goat polyclonal antibody. DAF sensitivity was determined for C3bBb(Ni2+) generated with each type A mutant and compared with that obtained with wild type C3bBb(Ni2+). The results are shown in Fig. 3 and Table I. Under the conditions used, most of the amino acid substitutions had no statistically significant effect on DAF-mediated decay acceleration. In contrast D254G, K265A/K266A (replacement of Lys-265 with A and Lys-266 with A), Q335A, Y338A, S339A, and D382A were markedly DAF-resistant, exhibiting 1–36% of the sensitivity of the wild type complex to DAF. Four other cases (E301A, E316A, W343A, and E379A) were slightly resistant to DAF (50–75% relative DAF sensitivity). Of the two mutations that removed an N-glycan, N*260D was markedly DAF-resistant while N*353A was indistinguishable from the wild type.Table IFactor B mutations that affect decay accelerationDAF sensitivityCR1 sensitivityFactor H sensitivityp valuesWild type100%100%100%D254G9 ± 26% (.007)4 ± 26% (.02)48 ± 18% (.008)N*260D32 ± 19% (.004)31 ± 17% (.01)24 ± 23% (.002)K265A/K266A18 ± 31% (.002)18 ± 30% (.0005)19 ± 31% (.0002)K294ANS1-aNS, not statistically significant (p> .05).44 ± 18% (.01)NSE301A75 ± 9% (.04)NSNSE316A71 ± 9% (.02)NSNSQ335A20 ± 28% (.02)22 ± 27% (.03)NSY338A3 ± 31% (.0001)0 ± 34% (.0002)66 ± 22% (.002)Y338F18 ± 27% (.0008)20 ± 29% (.0004)61 ± 20% (.003)Y338S5 ± 25% (.01)24 ± 20% (.008)NSS339A32 ± 20% (.007)50 ± 13% (.03)NSM341ANSNS75 ± 9% (.009)W343A55 ± 15% (.02)56 ± 12% (.04)NSE379A52 ± 17% (.01)50 ± 17% (.02)NSD382A36 ± 19% (.003)41 ± 16% (.001)NSD382N54 ± 20% (.02)NSNSE434ANS65 ± 14% (.01)NSD445ANS71 ± 13% (.01)NS1-a NS, not statistically significant (p> .05). Open table in a new tab Additional mutations of positions Tyr-338 and Asp-382 were made to identify the chemical properties of the side chains of these residues most critical to decay acceleration; while loss of the tyrosine 4-hydroxyl group from position 338 in the Y338F mutation reduced DAF sensitivity to 18% of the wild type level, further loss of the phenyl group in the Y338A and Y338S mutations reduced DAF effects to even greater degrees (3–5%) (p < 0.05 for both Y338A and Y338S when each was compared with Y338F). These observations imply that both the 4-hydroxyl and the phenyl group at position 338 make significant contributions to DAF-mediated decay acceleration. In contrast, while both D382N and D382A were DAF-resistant, there was no statistical difference between the affects of the two mutations (p = 0.48). That could imply that only the negative charge is of importance at position 382. CR1, like DAF, is capable of decay acceleration activity of the CP and AP convertases. Previously, the ELISA-based assay used in this study had been used to show that the amino-terminal region of CR1 is necessary and sufficient for the decay of C3bBb (27Krych-Goldberg M. Hauhart R.E. Bala Subramanian V. Yurcisin B.M. Crimmins D.L. Hourcade D.E. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31160-31168Google Scholar). In this study we used a CR1 amino-terminal construct, CR1-A (19Krych M. Clemenza L. Howdeshell D. Hauhart R. Hourcade D. Atkinson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13273-13278Google Scholar), to test mutant C3bBb(Ni2+) complexes for CR1 sensitivity. In general, CR1-A sensitivity correlated well to DAF sensitivity (Table I and Fig.4). All complexes that were found to be less than 50% DAF-sensitive were also found to be significantly insensitive to CR1. As with DAF, major effects in CR1 sensitivity were seen with D254G, N*260D, K265A/K266A, Q335A, Y338A, Y338F, and Y338S. We also examined the effects of the factor B mutations on factor H-mediated C3bBb(Ni2+) decay acceleration. In comparison to DAF and CR1, fewer mutants affected factor H sensitivity (Table I and Fig. 4). As with DAF and CR1, major effects were seen with N*260D and K265A/K266A (19–38% the factor H sensitivity of wild type). Of the other substitutions that caused markedly increased resistance to DAF, Y338A and Y338F were statistically significant, but relatively minor compared with their effects on DAF and CR1 decay acceleration (relative to the wild type, Y338A conferred 66% factor H sensitivity but only 3% DAF sensitivity and 0% CR1 sensitivity). Moreover, C3bBb assembled with the D254G protein retained 48% factor H sensitivity, but only 9% DAF sensitivity and 4% CR1 sensitivity. No significant factor H effects were seen with Q335A, S339A, or D382A. Minor reductions in factor H sensitivity were seen with M341A, a substitution where no changes were detected in decay acceleration mediated by DAF or CR1. As indicated, according to the model, the type A mutations made in this study are distributed over much of the domain surface (Fig. 2). In contrast, 12 of the 13 positions implicated in DAF/CR1 function were found in two discrete sites (Fig.5); one site involves six amino acid positions and is defined by nine mutations (Q335A, Y338A, Y338F, Y338S, S339A, W343, E379A, D382A, and D382N). That site is centered on two adjacent α helices (α 4 and α 5). The four most critical positions in this region (Glu-335, Tyr-338, Ser-339, and Asp-382) constitute a discrete functional epitope (Fig.6). The second site involves five amino acid positions and is defined by four mutations (D254G, N260D, K265A/K266A, E316A). That site consists of the α helix 1 and two adjacent loops and closely follows a portion of the previously reported C3b-binding region (see “Discussion”). Some mutations in the α 1 site dramatically affected factor H-mediated decay acceleration, while those in the α 4/5 site had, at most, very minor effects on factor H activity.Figure 6Model of the factor B type A domain. The α 4/5 amino acids most critical to decay acceleration arehighlighted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The mutants that were most dramatically DAF- and CR1-resistant, seven carrying mutations in the α 4/5 site and three carrying mutations in the α 1 site, were compared with the wild type factor B protein for other biochemical differences. All ten mutants were found hemolytically active (Table II), with many more active than wild type. It is not clear how to account for higher activity since, in addition to complex stability, hemolytic function could be influenced by many factors including assembly rate, the efficiency of protease activation, and possibly interactions with native red blood cell complement regulator molecules. With the exception of D254G, all of the mutants formed C3bBb(Ni2+) complexes 1- to 2-fold as readily as the wild type protein (Table II). D254G, previously shown to accentuate C3b binding and convertase stability (16Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2906-2911Google Scholar), formed C3bBb(Ni2+) complexes about 50-fold more readily than wild type, and much less protein was required to produce equivalent detectable complex.Table IIAdditional characteristics of factor B mutations that effect decay accelerationWild typeC3bBb(Ni2+) formationC3bBb(Ni2+) decayHemolytic activity%100100100D254G490218264N*260D1504391K265A/K266A195167104Q335A94138151Y338A16772377Y338F17970189Y338S15154212S339A14288191D382A15392232D382N15799367 Open table in a new tab We also examined the rate of spontaneous dissociation of C3bBb(Ni2+) for all the DAF/CR1-resistant mutant C3bBb(Ni2+) complexes (Table II). In the α 1 region, D254G increased C3bBb stability 500%, and N*260D increased C3bBb stability 200%. In the α 4/5 region, Y388A increased stability about 50%. Mutations of the other α 4/5 positions (Glu-335, Ser-339, and Asp-382) had lesser effects on the stability of the C3bBb(Ni2+) complex. The C3 convertases are the central amplification enzymes of the complement cascade, and their proper regulation is essential to promote and facilitate elimination of foreign agents by effector cells while at the same time protecting self-tissues from complement-mediated destruction. A family of regulators, the RCA proteins, has evolved to serve this purpose, and these proteins are found both on cell surfaces and in the serum. In this regard, multiple RCA proteins can promote the dissociation (decay acceleration) of the C3 convertases. In this work we sought to map within Bb the biochemical interactions involved in this process. Four of the human RCA proteins are capable of decay-acceleration: factor H can dissociate AP convertases, C4-binding protein (C4bp) can dissociate CP convertases, and CR1 and DAF can dissociate both AP and CP convertases. Of these four proteins, three can serve as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and/or C4b: factor H (C3b), C4bp (C4b), and CR1 (C3b and C4b). In the case of DAF the analysis of decay acceleration is simpler because it has no potentially confounding interactions providing for stable C3b or C4b binding or serving as a cofactor for factor I-mediated cleavage. We began our search for DAF·Bb interaction sites by constructing a panel of factor B mutants, focusing on the type A domain because search for of the presence of C3b-binding elements in this region. Previous studies showed that when the isolated factor B type A domain is bound to C3b and the complex treated with trypsin, the type A peptide fragments that remain bound to C3b are from the apex of the domain, near the divalent cation-binding site (21Hinshelwood J. Spencer D.I.R. Edwards Y.J.K. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 587-599Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). These assignments were consistent with prior mutagenesis studies directed at the C3b-binding elements of factor B (16Hourcade D.E. Mitchell L.M. Oglesby T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2906-2911Google Scholar, 25Tuckwell D.S. Xu Y. Newham P. Humphries M.J. Volanakis J.E. Biochem. 1997; 36: 6605-6613Google Scholar). Most of the mutants we prepared were single or double alanine substitutions that retained the capacity for C3bBb assembly and the function required for hemolytic activity. C3bBb complexes then were made with mutant or wild type factor B protein, and the DAF sensitivity of mutant complexes were compared with that of the wild type complexes. Several observations were made. 1) Mutations in 12 of 29 type A amino acid positions interfered with DAF-mediated regulation (Fig. 3 and Table I). 2) Two type A sites were involved in decay acceleration (Fig.5). One site was centered around two adjacent α helices (α 4 and α 5) defined by six amino acid positions; a second site was located on the α 1 helix and two nearby loops defined by five amino acid positions in a region that includes C3b-binding elements. Two DAF-resistant α 1 mutations also markedly increased C3bBb stability (Table II). 3) The above two sites implicated in DAF-mediated decay acceleration are located on opposite sides of the type A domain (Fig.5). Three polar residues, Glu-335, Tyr-338, and Ser-339, and one acidic residue, Asp-382, appear to be most critical in the DAF/type A interaction. Together they form a contiguous patch on the surface of the type A domain model (Fig. 6). The tyrosine residue at position 338 is particularly relevant; alanine or serine substitution at this single position reduced decay acceleration to a few percent of wild type decay acceleration. Indeed, loss of the 4-hydroxyl group of the Tyr-338 side chain by phenylalanine substitution (Y338F) resulted in substantial loss in DAF sensitivity, suggesting an important role for hydrogen bonding at this point. Given the difference between Y338A and Y338F (Y338F is more active than Y338A), the Tyr-338 phenyl group also appears instrumental in the process. The side chain hydroxyl of Ser-339 is also of interest, since its removal (in S339A) also reduces DAF sensitivity. While it is impossible to determine whether the Tyr, Glu, and/or Ser side chains directly contact DAF, or instead are important structural elements of the α 4/5 contact region, tyrosine has been found to be a frequent “hot spot” of other protein interfaces (28Hu Z. Ma B. Wolfson H. Nussinov R. Proteins. 2000; 39: 331-342Google Scholar,29Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Google Scholar). Each C3bBb complex was also examined for its behavior in the presence of CR1 or factor H. In general, factor B mutations that affected DAF-mediated decay acceleration similarly affected CR1-mediated decay acceleration (Fig. 4 and Table I). In contrast, fewer factor B mutations altered factor H decay acceleration activity. While the two DAF and CR1-resistant α 1 mutants also rendered C3bBb partially resistant to factor H, the most dramatic DAF and CR1-resistant α 4/5 mutants conferred, at most, only subtle changes in factor H sensitivity (Fig. 4 and Table I). The α 1 helix partially overlaps the C3b-binding region of the type A domain (Fig. 5). In contrast, the α 4/5 site is somewhat removed from the C3b-binding region (Fig. 5). One simple interpretation of these relationships would be that DAF and CR1 interact with C3bBb at the α 4/5 region and that mutations in the α 4/5 region directly disrupt these interactions. In contrast, the α 1 mutations would exert their effects directly on the C3b/Bb interface, obstructing changes in the interface that are at play during the dissociation of C3b from Bb, whether dissociation is spontaneous or accelerated by DAF, CR1, or factor H. Although all three regulators were affected by some of the type A mutations, it appears that the mutation/response “spectra” of CR1 and DAF are quite similar, while that of factor H differs (Fig. 4 and Table I). This could imply that CR1 and DAF utilize similar biochemical mechanisms to promote decay acceleration. Both of these membrane-bound proteins require three CCPs for decay acceleration activity, CCP 2–4 of DAF and CCP 1–3 of CR1, with the two respective regions homologous by amino acid sequence and by intron/exon structure. The factor H protein is also encoded at the RCA cluster and composed of homologous CCPs, but it evolved as a serum protein, which could account for possible mechanistic differences. Previous studies have shown that DAF CCPs 2–4 are involved in the decay acceleration of AP C3 convertase (8Brodbeck W.G. Liu D. Sperry J. Mold C. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2528-2533Google Scholar) and a positively charged region between CCP 2 and CCP 3 has been implicated in the process (12Kuttner-Kondo L. Medof M.E. Brodbeck W. Shoham M. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1143-1149Google Scholar,18Kuttner-Kondo L.A. Mitchell L. Hourcade D.E. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2164-2171Google Scholar). Given the importance of the factor B polar residues at the α 4/5 region, the DAF·C3bBb interaction may be determined in large part by extensive hydrogen interactions between this region and the positively charged residues of DAF. Given that three DAF CCPs (or three CR1 CCPs) are required for decay acceleration of the AP C3 convertase, it is also possible that DAF and/or CR1 interactions with convertase are not limited to the type A region. Additional DAF·C3bBb interactions might extend to C3b or the factor B serine protease domain. If DAF and CR1 interact with Bb distal to the C3b-binding site, how does this affect the C3bBb association? Allosteric signaling has been observed in other type A domain-containing proteins: In the case of von Willibrand factor, a heparin interaction at the type A1 base down-regulates a glycoprotein Ib (GpIb) binding site located at the domain cleft (21Hinshelwood J. Spencer D.I.R. Edwards Y.J.K. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 587-599Google Scholar, 30Emsley J. Cruz M. Handin R. Liddington R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10396-10401Google Scholar, 31Perkins S.J. Hinshelwood J. Edwards Y.J.K. Jenkins P.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 815-821Google Scholar). Indeed, mutations that are clustered near the base of the domain and disrupt heparin binding also increase GpIb-binding affinity. A similar allosteric mechanism could account for the effects of DAF (CR1) on C3bBb decay and the negative impact of the α 4/5 mutations. It has been previously shown that the isolated factor B type A domain can occur in more than one physical conformation (32Hinshelwood J. Perkins S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 135-147Google Scholar). Thus, one possibility is that interaction of C3bBb with DAF or CR1 at the α 4/5 site participates in promoting a type A conformation with relatively low affinity for C3b. We thank Richard Hauhart for supplying the CR1-A protein and Madonna Bogacki for preparing the manuscript."

To determine the function of mammalian ELPs, we generated antibodies against a 70-kDa human ELP and showed that ELP70 coassembled with MTs in HeLa cell extracts and colocalized with MTs in the mitotic apparatus. To determine whether ELP70 bound to MTs directly, human ELP70 was expressed and purified to homogeneity from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Purified ELP70 bound to purified MTs with a stoichiometry of 0.40 ± 0.04 mol of ELP70/mol of tubulin dimer and with an intrinsic dissociation constant of 0.44 ± 0.13 μm. Using a nucleated assembly assay and video-enhanced differential interference contrast microscopy, we demonstrated that ELP70 reduced seeded nucleation, reduced the growth rate, and promoted MT catastrophes in a concentration-dependent manner. As a result, ELP70-containing MTs were significantly shorter than MTs assembled from tubulin alone. These data indicate that ELP70 is a novel MT destabilizer. A lateral destabilization model is presented to describe ELP70's effects on microtubules.

Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Google Scholar, 2Margolis R.L. Wilson L. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 830-836Google Scholar). Individual MTs can switch between extended periods of slow growth and rapid shrinkage. The transitions between these two states, known as catastrophe and rescue, are quite sudden and are believed to be stochastic events (3Walker R.A. O'Brien E.T. Pryer N.K. Soboeiro M.F. Voter W.A. Erickson H.P. Salmon E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1437-1448Google Scholar, 4Horio T. Hotani H. Nature. 1986; 321: 605-607Google Scholar). This dynamic behavior of MTs is best described by the dynamic instability model and is generally associated with the behavior of MT plus-ends nucleated at the centrosome (5Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 237-242Google Scholar, 6Mitchison T. Kirschner M. Nature. 1984; 312: 232-237Google Scholar). MT dynamics in living cells are highly regulated. For example, MTsin vivo polymerize more rapidly and undergo more frequent catastrophe and rescue events than do MTs assembled from pure tubulinin vitro (7Cassimeris L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 275-281Google Scholar). These results indicate that there are cellular factors that regulate individual parameters of MT dynamics (1Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Google Scholar). In addition to having cell type or tissue specific factors (8Shelden E. Wadsworth P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 935-945Google Scholar), the cell must regulate the activity of each factor during cell division (9McNally F.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 23-29Google Scholar, 10Andersen S.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 261-267Google Scholar), during cell differentiation (11Bulinski J.C. Gundersen G.G. Bioessays. 1991; 13: 285-293Google Scholar), and within different regions of the cell (12Wadsworth P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 42: 48-59Google Scholar). Recently, several proteins that destabilize MTs have been characterized. In yeast, Kar3 is a minus-end-directed kinesin that localizes to spindle poles in vivo and destabilizes MTs at their minus ends in vitro (13Endow S.A. Kang S.J. Satterwhite L.L. Rose M.D. Skeen V.P. Salmon E.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2708-2713Google Scholar, 14Saunders W. Hornack D. Lengyel V. Deng C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 417-431Google Scholar). Op18/stathmin is a low molecular weight tubulin-binding protein that destabilizes MTs in tissue culture cells (15Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Google Scholar) and in Xenopus egg extracts (16Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Google Scholar). XKCM1, a member of the Xenopus Kin I kinesin family, promotes catastrophes by favoring a conformational change at the MT ends that leads to protofilament peeling and MT shortening (17Walczak C.E. Mitchison T.J. Desai A. Cell. 1996; 84: 37-47Google Scholar, 18Desai A. Verma S. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 69-78Google Scholar). Katanin uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to sever MTs at the centrosomes (19McNally F.J. Thomas S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1847-1861Google Scholar, 20Hartman J.J. Mahr J. McNally K. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Thomas S. Cheesman S. Heuser J. Vale R.D. McNally F.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 277-287Google Scholar). It is clear that several proteins with different modis operandi destabilize MTs in the cell. One of the most abundant microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) in dividing sea urchin embryos is the echinoderm MT-associated protein (EMAP) (21Keller 3rd, T.C. Rebhun L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 788-796Google Scholar, 22Suprenant K.A. Marsh J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 87: 71-84Google Scholar, 23Vallee R.B. Bloom G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6259-6263Google Scholar). EMAP is a 75-kDa, WD repeat protein with little sequence similarity to other well-characterized MAP families (24Li Q. Suprenant K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31777-31784Google Scholar, 25Suprenant K.A. Tuxhorn J.A. Daggett M.A. Ahrens D.P. Hostetler A. Palange J.M. VanWinkle C.E. Livingston B.T. Dev. Genes Evol. 2000; 210: 2-10Google Scholar). In early embryos, EMAP localizes to the MTs of the first cleavage mitotic apparatus where it is hyperphosphorylated (26Bloom G.S. Luca F.C. Collins C.A. Vallee R.B. Cell Motil. 1985; 5: 431-446Google Scholar, 27Suprenant K.A. Dean K. McKee J. Hake S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 445-450Google Scholar, 28Brisch E. Daggett M.A. Suprenant K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2885-2893Google Scholar). Although the function of EMAP in cells is unknown, its evolutionary conservation suggests that it plays an important role in MT assembly and function in a variety of cells (25Suprenant K.A. Tuxhorn J.A. Daggett M.A. Ahrens D.P. Hostetler A. Palange J.M. VanWinkle C.E. Livingston B.T. Dev. Genes Evol. 2000; 210: 2-10Google Scholar). Here, we characterize a 70-kDa human EMAP-like protein (ELP70), show that it is a novel MT destabilizer, and suggest that it is an important regulator of MT dynamics during the cell cycle. HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 Hams' plus 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 10,000 units/ml (1670 units/mg) penicillin, and 10 mg/ml streptomycin. Paclitaxel (Taxol) was a gift of the Drug Synthesis and/Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment, NCI, National Institutes of Health. GTP (tetralithium salt) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and was stored as a stock solution in distilled water at −80 °C. Monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (TUB 2.1) was from the Sigma Chemical Corp. Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and rabbit secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. ELP70 was expressed as a 6His fusion protein in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. The full-length ELP70 coding sequence was inserted into theKpnI and NdeI restriction sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pAcHLT-C (BD PharMingen Inc.). Sf9 insect cells were transfected with this construct and the linearized BaculoGold baculovirus DNA. Active viruses generated by homologous recombination (Ac6HisELP70) were isolated as individual plaques that were subsequently amplified and used for infection of Sf9 cells. Sf9 cell lysates were prepared at 72 h post-infection by sonication in 50 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 0.5m NaCl, pH 7.5, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. The lysate was centrifuged (10 min at 39,000 ×g), and 6HisELP70 was purified from the supernatant fluids by cobalt-affinity chromatography (TALON metal affinity resin,CLONTECH Laboratory Inc.) and size exclusion chromatography (BIO-GEL P60, Bio-Rad Inc.). 6His ELP70 was concentrated by vacuum dialysis into 80 mm PIPES/K+, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8 (BRB80). The final concentration of ELP70 was ∼0.35 g/liter (4.7 μm). Tubulin was purified to homogeneity from bovine brain by three cycles of MT assembly followed by phosphocellulose chromatography (29Tiwari S.C. Suprenant K.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 215: 96-103Google Scholar, 30Algaier J. Himes R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 235-243Google Scholar). MTs were polymerized at 28 °C by the stepwise addition of paclitaxel to a final concentration of 20 μm. A constant amount of paclitaxel-stabilized MTs (10 μg) was mixed with ELP70 in BRB80 containing 1 mm GTP and 20 μm paclitaxel. After 30 min, MTs were pelleted at 100,000 × g (10 min). Bound and free ELP70 was quantitated from Coomassie Blue-stained gels as described below. Purified ELP70, for which the protein mass had been determined by a BCA assay (see below), was used as an internal standard on the same gel. Control experiments were carried out with identical concentrations of ELP70 in the absence of MTs. Densitometric analysis of the gels was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet and quantitated using IMAGE version 1.6.1 (National Institutes of Health, available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). To obtain the number of ELP70 molecules, the area under each protein peak was converted to total mass units and divided by 70,000, the relative molecular mass of ELP70. The behavior of individual MTs nucleated from Chlamydomonas flagellar axonemes was visualized using video-enhanced differential interference contrast (VE-DIC) microscopy as described previously (31Vasquez R.J. Gard D.L. Cassimeris L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 985-993Google Scholar). The microscope stage was maintained at 37 °C with an air curtain incubator, and the samples were preincubated for 30 min to reach a steady state prior to data collection. Data were collected during the following 30–45 min. A Nikon Optiphot microscope equipped with rectified DIC optics and high extinction HN-32 polarizers was used to visualize individual MTs. The light beam from a 100-watt mercury lamp passed through a fiber optic light scrambler (Technical Video, Ltd.), a 546-DF 24-nm interference filter and KG-5 heat-absorbing filter, and a 1.4-numerical aperture (NA) condenser, and images were formed with a 60× PlanApo 1.4-NA objective. Background-subtracted and contrast-enhanced images were captured by a Hamamatsu C2400 Newvicon camera and Argus-10 image processor. Super VHS format recordings were digitized with a Video Van Gogh board (Tekmatic Systems Inc.) and analyzed with the Real Time Measurement software (kindly provided by Ted Salmon, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). MT growth and shortening rates were analyzed by a Student's t test. For protein expression, an ELP70 cDNA encoding amino acids 31–648 was cloned into theXho/BamHI site of the pET14b vector (Novagen, Inc.) and was transfected into the lysogenic Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) plysS (32Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). Following isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, inclusion bodies containing the expressed protein were isolated and fractionated on a preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against the electro-eluted ELP70 (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc.). Affinity-purified antibodies were isolated by column chromatography (33Field C.M. Oegema K. Zheng Y. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 525-541Google Scholar). Briefly, purified inclusion bodies were solubilized in 0.1m sodium borate, pH 9.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.5% SDS and coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) (34Vaisberg E.A. Koonce M.P. McIntosh J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 849-858Google Scholar). Anti-ELP70 antiserum (UK176) was diluted 1:1 in TBS (15 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), sterile-filtered (0.2 μm), and passed over the column five times. After washing as described previously (33Field C.M. Oegema K. Zheng Y. Mitchison T.J. Walczak C.E. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 525-541Google Scholar), antibodies were eluted with 0.2 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.0, or 6 m guanidine HCl in TBS. Antibody-containing eluates were dialyzed into TBS, concentrated with a Centricon 30 (Amicon Corp.), made 50% in glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. MTs were assembled and purified from 5 g of frozen HeLa cells as described previously (35Vallee R.B. Collins C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 116-127Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were homogenized in 2 volumes of BRB80 containing a protease inhibitor mixture that contained 158 mg/ml benzamidine, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml pepstatin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml antipain, 1 mg/ml chymostatin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm (Beckman JA 20 rotor) for 10 min at 2 °C. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm (Beckman Ti65 rotor) for 90 min at 2 °C. Paclitaxel and GTP were added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 20 μm and 0.5 mm, respectively. The cytosolic extract was briefly warmed to 37 °C (3–5 min) and then chilled for 15 min on ice. The cytosolic extract was transferred to a chilled centrifuge tube and underlayed with ice-cold BRB80 containing 10% w/v sucrose, 20 μmpaclitaxel, and 0.5 mm GTP. MTs were pelleted through the sucrose cushion by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm (Beckman JA20 rotor) for 30 min at 2 °C. MT proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. HeLa cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) in PBS (15 min at room temperature). After fixation, cells were rinsed three times (∼5 min each) in PBS and permeabilized with 0.15% (w/v) saponin in PBS (5 min). Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated in primary antibodies diluted into PBS with 0.15%(w/v) saponin (aldehyde fixation) for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing five times with PBS, the primary antibodies were detected Cy3- or Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies diluted in PBS containing saponin. After 1 h at 37 °C coverslips were rinsed five times in PBS and mounted on microscope slides in a solution comprised of 90% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (v/v) PBS, pH 9.0, and 5% (w/v)n-propyl gallate. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were viewed with a Nikon Optiphot microscope, and images were recorded on T-MAX 400 film. Negatives were digitized, and images were contrast-enhanced with Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Photosystems, Inc.). Random-priming of an ELP70 retina cDNA (H92185) generated a [32P]CTP-labeled ELP70 probe that was hybridized to a human cancer cell line Multiple Tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.). Proteins were analyzed on SDS-denaturing polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue (36Laemmli U.K. Beguin F. Gujer-Kellenberger G. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 47: 69-85Google Scholar). Gels were scanned and quantitated by densitometry using the IMAGE software, version 1.61 (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). For standardization, known amounts ELP70 were run on the same gel. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred from SDS-PAGE gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Inc.) (37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 145-149Google Scholar), probed with affinity-purified anti-ELP70 antibodies, and visualized by chemiluminescence with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Tropix Inc.). Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce Inc.) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The echinodermMT-associated protein (EMAP) is a member of a family of EMAP-likeproteins (ELPs) found in many metazoans and at least one protozoan (Fig. 1). In humans, there are three EMAP-like proteins (ELPs): ELP70, ELP79/EMAPL, and ELP120/ropp120 (GenBankTM accession numbers AF103939, U97018, andAAG09279). The gene for ELP79, the first EMAP-like protein (EMAPL) identified in humans, was positionally cloned from the Usher syndrome 1A locus at 14q32 (38Eudy J.D. Ma-Edmonds M. Yao S.F. Talmadge C.B. Kelley P.M. Weston M.D. Kimberling W.J. Sumegi J. Genomics. 1997; 43: 104-106Google Scholar). The role played by ELP79 in Ushers is unknown at this time, but cytoskeletal defects are believed to be responsible for the retinitis pigmentosa, vestibular dysfunction, and deafness, characteristic of this disorder (39Barrong S.D. Chaitin M.H. Fliesler S.J. Possin D.E. Jacobson S.G. Milam A.H. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1992; 110: 706-710Google Scholar, 40Weil D. Blanchard S. Kaplan J. Guilford P. Gibson F. Walsh J. Mburu P. Varela A. Levilliers J. Weston M.D. Nature. 1995; 374: 60-61Google Scholar). ELP70 was identified and cloned by homology to sea urchin EMAP and is the most similar to sea urchin EMAP (41Lepley D.M. Palange J.M. Suprenant K.A. Gene. 1999; 237: 343-349Google Scholar), sharing 57% sequence identity and 77% sequence similarity over the length of the polypeptide. At 981 amino acids in length, ELP120/ropp120 is the largest member of the ELP family in humans. ELP120/ropp120 is less conserved over the full-length of the polypeptide, but only because there are long NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences not found in either ELP79 or ELP70. Interestingly, ELP120/ropp120 was originally identified as therestrictedly overexpressedproliferation-associated protein (ropp), which is dramatically overexpressed during mitosis (42Heidebrecht H.J. Buck F. Pollmann M. Siebert R. Parwaresch R. Genomics. 2000; 68: 348-350Google Scholar). In addition to the human ELPs, complete ELP-coding sequences are predicted for the ciliate Euplotes octocarinatus (AJ251505), the sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (U15551) andLytechinus variegatus (AF136234), the fruit fly,Drosophila melanogaster (CT32830), and the nematode,Caenorhabditis elegans (Z92833). A comparison of eight ELP sequences revealed a highly conserved 43-amino acid domain that begins with an invariant proline residue (Fig. 1, a and b). This hydrophobicELP (HELP) domain is 97% conserved between human and sea urchin ELPs and has not been detected in other known proteins. This high degree of conservation among ELP family members indicates that the HELP domain is likely to be critical to ELP function. For example, a preliminary study has shown that the NH2 terminus of sea urchin EMAP, which contains the HELP domain, is sufficient for MT binding in vitro (43Eichenmüller B. Ahrens D.P. Li Q. Suprenant K.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 50: 161-172Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal region of ELP70 is also very rich in the amino acids proline, serine, and arginine. Although there is no striking sequence homology between this region and the known MT binding domains of other MAPs, serine- and proline-rich domains have been identified in MAP-4 (44Olson K.R. McIntosh J.R. Olmsted J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 639-650Google Scholar). In addition, all members of the ELP family share a conserved SGGG motif (amino acids 310–314, ELP70) perhaps analogous to the PGGG repeat domain of MAP-2, MAP-4, and tau (45Lewis S.A. Wang D.H. Cowan N.J. Science. 1988; 242: 936-939Google Scholar, 46West R.R. Tenbarge K.M. Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21886-21896Google Scholar). Unlike the latter MAPs, the SGGG motif is only found once in the ELP sequence. Over 75% of the ELP70 polypeptide is comprised of a series of 11 domains that satisfy the regular expression pattern of a WD repeat domain (Fig. 1c). WD repeats are found in a variety of proteins involved with RNA processing, transcriptional regulation, cytoskeleton assembly, and vesicular trafficking (bmerc-www.bu.edu/wdrepeat). The crystal structure of the Gβ subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, transducin, revealed that a WD repeat adopts a β-propeller fold comprised of a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (47Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Google Scholar). By analogy to β-transducin, ELP70 may fold into an 11-bladed propeller structure. ELP70 is expressed in a variety of normal tissues from a single gene located on chromosome 19 (41). To determine if ELP70 was expressed in human cancer cell lines, we probed a Northern blot with a 550-bp probe corresponding to the COOH terminus of ELP70 (Fig. 2). The ELP70 probe recognized a major 2.5-kb band in HeLa (S3), chronic myelogenous leukemia (K-562), lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT-4), colorectal adenocarcinoma (SW480), lung carcinoma (A549), and melanoma (G361) cells. The ELP70 probe also hybridized to a 3.2-kb major band in promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) and Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji), indicating that there may be tissue-specific alternative splicing of ELP70 transcripts. The 3.2-kb band was also observed in HeLa, colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung carcinoma, and melanoma cells but at much lower levels (data not shown). These results are interesting in light of the fact that, in normal human tissues, the 3.2-kb band is only detected in brain and spinal cord (41Lepley D.M. Palange J.M. Suprenant K.A. Gene. 1999; 237: 343-349Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that ELP70 RNA processing is altered in tumor cells. Because ELP70 transcripts were abundant in HeLa cells, we used antibodies generated against a bacterially expressed ELP70 fusion protein to determine if ELP70 proteins were associated with HeLa MTs. Affinity-purified ELP70 antibodies recognized a polypeptide with a molecular mass consistent with the conceptually translated ELP70 cDNA (70 kDa) and not the related ELP79 (79 kDa) or ELP120 (120 kDa) cDNAs (Fig. 3). To determine whether HeLa ELP70 was an MT-binding protein, endogenous HeLa MTs were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The immunoblot shown in Fig. 3shows that the 70-kDa ELP70 polypeptide was greatly enriched in the MT pellet and depleted in the MT-depleted supernatant. These results are consistent with the ELP70 polypeptide being an MT-binding protein in HeLa cells. Because ELP70 is associated with MTs in vitro, the affinity-purified antibodies were used to examine the intracellular distribution of ELP70 in dividing HeLa cells. The images presented in Fig. 4 show that ELP70 was concentrated in the region of the mitotic spindle apparatus. To determine whether ELP70 bound directly to MTs, a 6His-ELP70 fusion protein was purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells and incubated with paclitaxel-stabilized MTs (Fig. 5). Purified ELP70 bound directly to purified bovine brain MTs. In similar assays no ELP70 sedimented in the presence of actin filaments, intermediate filaments, or in the absence of MTs. The results of several binding assays with a constant amount of paclitaxel-stabilized MTs indicated that ELP70 bound to MTs in a concentration-dependent manner. From these data, an equilibrium-binding isotherm was obtained (Fig.6). ELP70 binding to bovine brain MTs was saturated at a stoichiometry of 0.40 ± 0.04 mol of ELP70/mol of tubulin dimer and the intrinsic dissociation constant (Kd) for ELP70 binding to MTs was determined to be 0.44 ± 0.13 μm. This level of saturation indicated that ELP70 binds along the length of the MT polymer. In support of this conclusion, we found no evidence that ELP70 bound preferentially to MT ends. The same quantity of ELP70 copelleted with longer MTs as with an equal mass of shorter MTs produced by shearing with a syringe (data not shown). To examine the effect of ELP70 on MT dynamics in vitro, individual MTs nucleated from axonemes were visualized by VE-DIC microscopy. As shown in Fig. 7, seeded nucleation was dependent upon the ELP70 concentration. The number of MTs emanating from the plus-ends of individual axonemes was reduced from an average value of 4.67 ± 1.44 MTs per axoneme (no ELP70) (n = 15, where n = number of axonemes) to 3.43 ± 1.17 MTs per axoneme (0. 5 μmELP70) (n = 21) and 2.23 ± 0.93 MTs per axoneme (0.8 μm ELP70) (n = 13). The reduction in seeded nucleation was statistically significant (p < 0.05) at both concentrations of ELP70. In addition to reducing seeded nucleation, plus-end MT lengths were dramatically shorter (Fig. 8, TableI). In the presence of 0.8 μm ELP70, more than 55% of the MTs were shorter than 3 μm (compared with none without ELP70) and MTs rarely exceeded a length of 6 μm. At these concentrations of ELP70 and tubulin, there were very few minus-end MTs that could be measured. At higher ratios of ELP70 to tubulin, the MTs were too few and too short to gather meaningful data regarding further increases in the frequency of catastrophe or reduction of growth rate.Table IELP70 reduces microtubule elongation velocity and increases catastrophes at the plus-ends of microtubulesPlus-ends13 μm tubulin13 μm tubulin + 0.5 μm ELP7016 μm tubulin16 μm tubulin + 0.5 μm ELP7016 μm tubulin + 0.8 μm ELP70Ve (μm/min)0.78 ± 0.230.47 ± 0.150.94 ± 0.240.71 ± 0.170.64 ± 0.21 n6637587833Vs (μm/min)32.6 ± 8.033.9 ± 12.035.8 ± 10.329.7 ± 9.335.4 ± 11.4 n4627385323fcat (min−1)0.23 ± 0.030.45 ± 0.070.20 ± 0.030.31 ± 0.040.43 ± 0.07 n6640507540fres (min−1)0.31 ± 0.16n.o.0.16 ± 0.110.35 ± 0.180.22 n 4 2 4 1Lavg (μm)3.3 ± 1.11.0 ± 0.44.7 ± 1.22.3 ± 0.51.5 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab Individual parameters of dynamic instability such as the elongation and shortening rates as well as catastrophe and rescue frequencies were analyzed at video frame rates. As shown in Tables I and II, ELP70 had major effects on the dynamic behavior of MTs. The elongation rate was reduced significantly in the presence of sub-stoichiometric levels of ELP70. For example, the addition of 0.5 μm ELP70 to 16 μm tubulin significantly reduced the elongation rate from 0.94 ± 0.24 μm/min to 0.71 ± 0.17 μm/min (p < 0.001). Increasing the concentration of ELP70 from 0.5 to 0.8 μm resulted in an additional significant decrease in the elongation rate from 0.71 ± 0.17 to 0.64 ± 0.21 μm/min (p < 0.05). The ELP70-dependent reduction in the elongation rate was concentration-dependent and was more apparent at a tubulin concentration of 13 μm, where the addition of 0.5 μm ELP70 decreased the elongation rate from 0.78 ± 0.23 to 0.47 ± 0.15 μm/min (p < 0.001). In contrast to the effects on elongation, ELP70 appeared to have little effect on the velocity of shortening.Table IIParameters for microtubule dynamics at the minus-ends of microtubulesMinus-ends16 μm tubulin16 μm tubulin + 0.5 μm ELP70Ve (μm/min)0.19 ± 0.070.21 ± 0.10 n2727Vs (μm/min)44.3 ± 19.745.3 ± 19.8 n1914fcat (min−1)0.17 ± 0.040.26 ± 0.05 n2224fres (min−1)10.2 ± 3.14.9 ± 1.9 n11 7Lavg (μm)1.1 ± 0.40.8 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab These ELP70-dependent effects on the elongation rate were specific to the plus-ends of the MTs. Minus-end MTs grew at the same rate in the presence and absence of ELP70 (TableII). ELP70 also increased the transition from a growing MT to shortening MT (catastrophe frequency), in a concentration-dependent manner. For example, in the presence of 0.8 μm ELP70 and 16 μm tubulin, plus-end catastrophes were observed every 140 s (40 catastrophes in 5581 s of elongation) compared with one catastrophe every 300 s for 16 μm tubulin alone (50 catastrophes in 15,000 s of elongation). This is a 2.2-fold increase in the catastrophe frequency. An increase in the catastrophe frequency was observed for the minus-end MTs as well. Although the frequency of catastrophe increased at both the plus- and minus-ends of MTs in the presence of ELP70, there was no apparent effect on the shortening rates at either the plus- or minus-ends. In addition, there was no apparent effect on the transition from a shortening MT to a growing MT (rescue frequency) at the plus-end. Generally, plus-end MTs, polymerized at these tubulin concentrations, shortened all the way back to the nucleation site, and rescue events were observed very infreque"

The C-C chemokine eotaxin-1 is a potent chemoattractant for eosinophils and Th2 lymphocytes, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis, and acts via binding to its receptor CCR3. To investigate the role of NF-κB signaling in the regulation of these genes, we stably expressed a transdominant mutant of IκBα and a constitutively active mutant of IKK-2 in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts. The transdominant IκBα mutant completely inhibited TNF-α-mediated induction of botheotaxin-1 and CCR3, whereas expression of constitutively active IKK-2 was sufficient to drive almost full expression of these two genes in the absence of TNF-α. Moreover, we observed elevated expression levels of CCR3 and eotaxin-1 protein levels in the skin of IκBα-deficient mice characterized by a widespread dermatitis. Finally, using dermal fibroblasts derived from IκBα-deficient mice, we observed elevated basal expression, enhanced inducibility by TNF-α, and attenuated down-regulation upon TNF-α withdrawal of both CCR3 and eotaxin-1mRNA levels. These results demonstrate that the IKK-2/IκBα/NF-κB pathway plays a critical role forCCR3 and eotaxin-1 expression in fibroblasts and suggests a critical link to the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis.

Rel family members (p65/RelA, RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52) form homo- or heterodimeric complexes with each other that constitute the NF-κB complex (1Denk A. Wirth T. Baumann B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 303-320Google Scholar, 2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). The critical role of NF-κB family members for distinct cellular functions, such as cell proliferation, cytokine gene expression, or protection from apoptosis, has been revealed by gene knockout experiments (2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). In addition, there is increasing evidence for a role of NF-κB transcription factors in different pathophysiological processes, including atherosclerosis and cancer (3Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB is inactive because of association with inhibitor κB (IκB) proteins that mask the nuclear localization sequence of NF-κB, thereby retaining it in the cytoplasm and preventing DNA binding. Several IκB proteins are involved in the control of NF-κB activity, three of these, i.e. IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε, act in a stimulus-dependent manner. Upon inflammatory activation, IκB is phosphorylated in its N-terminal domain; subsequently it becomes ubiquitinylated and finally degraded by the proteasome. This allows nuclear translocation of NF-κB and binding to cognate DNA motifs in the promoter region of target genes, which subsequently initiates transcription. The critical step in NF-κB activation is the phosphorylation of IκB by a large multisubunit kinase complex consisting of IκB kinases (IKK) 1/α and 2/β as well as an additional essential protein, NEMO/IKKγ (reviewed in Ref.2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). NEMO represents the regulatory component of the IKK complex, whereas IKK1 and IKK2 act as catalytic subunits. Both IKKs can phosphorylate all three IκB proteins (α, β, and ε) to a similar extent; however, from gene knockout experiments it became clear that IKK2 plays the dominant role in signal-induced phosphorylation/degradation of IκB proteins (reviewed in Ref. 2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). IκB degradation and subsequently NF-κB activity can be induced in many cell types by different stimuli. Several parallel signal transduction pathways appear to exist, all of which ultimately result in IKK activation and IκB degradation (Ref. 4Baumann B. Weber C.K. Troppmair J. Whiteside S. Israel A. Rapp U.R. Wirth T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4615-4620Google Scholar and references therein). Among the best understood signaling pathways are the ones for the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-1 (5Malinin M.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Google Scholar). Chemokines are a large family of small proteins involved in the activation and recruitment of specific cell populations during disease (reviewed in Ref. 6Lukacs N.W. Oliveira S.H.P. Hogaboam C.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 995-999Google Scholar). Eotaxin-1 is a potent eosinophil chemoattractant belonging to the class of C-C chemokines (7Jose P.J. Griffiths J.D. Collins P.D. Walsh D.T. Moqbel R. Totty N.F. Truong O. Hsuan J.J. Williams T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 881-887Google Scholar). The protein is potent in inducing eosinophil accumulation in vivo (7Jose P.J. Griffiths J.D. Collins P.D.

Lloyd C. Gonzalo J.A. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 500-504Google Scholar). Eotaxin-1 expression was found to be restricted to a few cell types, including eosinophils, bronchial epithelial cells, and dermal fibroblasts (reviewed in Refs. 9Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Lloyd C. Gonzalo J.A. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 500-504Google Scholar and 10Huber M.A. Kraut N. Addicks T. Peter R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 546-552Google Scholar). Its expression has been found to be enhanced in these cell types in asthmatics, and increased expression is associated with disease severity (11Mattoli S. Stacey M.A. Sun G. Bellini A. Martini M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 299-301Google Scholar, 12Ying S. Robinson D.S. Meng Q. Rottman J. Kennedy R. Ringler D.J. Mackay C.R. Daugherty B.L. Springer M.S. Durham S.R. Williams T.J. Kay A.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3507-3516Google Scholar). Moreover, eotaxin-1 expression in epithelial cells was found to be increased in atopic dermatitis (13Yawalkar N. Uguccioni M. Schärer J. Braunwalder J. Karlen S. Dewald B. Braathen L.R. Baggiolini M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 43-48Google Scholar), as well as in other inflammatory conditions (14Garcia-Zepeda E. Rothenberg M.E. Ownbey R.T. Celestin J. Leder P. Luster A.D. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 449-456Google Scholar). The expression of eotaxin-1can be induced by TNF-α in epithelial cell lines, such as A549 cells (15Lilly C.M. Nakamura H. Kesselman H. Nagler-Anderson C. Asano K. Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Rothenberg M.E. Drazen J.M. Luster A.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1767-1773Google Scholar), and by IL-1α and TNF-α in fibroblasts (16Bartels J. Schluter C. Richter E. Noso N. Kulke R. Christophers E. Schröder J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1045-1051Google Scholar, 17Hein H. Schluter C. Kulke R. Christophers E. Schröder J.M. Bartels J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 537-542Google Scholar). In contrast to most other eosinophil chemoattractants of the CC-chemokine family that generally act on several receptors, eotaxin-1 only signals via one specific chemokine receptor, namely the G protein-coupled receptor CCR3 (reviewed in Ref. 18Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 675-705Google Scholar). CCR3 is prominently expressed on eosinophils, basophils, Th2-type lymphocytes, and fibroblasts (reviewed in Refs. 10Huber M.A. Kraut N. Addicks T. Peter R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 546-552Google Scholar and 12Ying S. Robinson D.S. Meng Q. Rottman J. Kennedy R. Ringler D.J. Mackay C.R. Daugherty B.L. Springer M.S. Durham S.R. Williams T.J. Kay A.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3507-3516Google Scholar). Based on these findings, an analysis of the regulation of CCR3 and eotaxin-1 expression in fibroblasts, in particular in dermal fibroblasts, is likely to yield information relevant to the pathogenesis of allergic inflammation such as atopic dermatitis. Although very little is known on how CCR3 is regulated at the transcriptional level, there is increasing evidence that NF-κB may be involved in the regulation of eotaxin-1 expression. Firstly, NF-κB elements are present in the eotaxin-1promoter in both humans and mice (17Hein H. Schluter C. Kulke R. Christophers E. Schröder J.M. Bartels J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 537-542Google Scholar, 19Garcia-Zepeda E.A. Rothenberg M.E. Weremowicz S. Sarafi M.N. Morton C.C. Luster A.D. Genomics. 1997; 41: 471-476Google Scholar). Second, mouse knockouts lacking the p50 subunit of NF-κB show no eotaxin-1induction in response to ovalbumin challenge (20Yang L. Cohn L. Zhang D.H. Homer R. Ray A. Ray P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1739-1750Google Scholar). Third,eotaxin-1 promoter activity was increased by TNF-α, and an NF-κB binding site was shown to be critical for this induction in the airway epithelial cell line BEAS-2B (21Matsukura S. Stellato C. Plitt J.R. Bickel C. Miura K. Georas S.N. Casolaro V. Schleimer R.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6876-6883Google Scholar). Finally, an NF-κB binding site in the eotaxin-1 promoter was shown to be critical for the induction of eotaxin-1 by IL-1β in A549 airway epithelial cells (22Jedrzkiewicz S. Nakamura H. Silverman E.S. Luster A.D. Mansharamani N. In K.H. Tamura G. Lilly C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1058-L1065Google Scholar). Even though these observations point toward an important role of NF-κB in eotaxin-1 regulation, neither of these reports has demonstrated whether or not this signaling pathway is essential in a stimulus-dependent manner and/or in an in vivosituation. Here, we have investigated the role of NF-κB signaling for the regulation of CCR3 and eotaxin-1, two key regulators of atopic inflammatory responses. Upon exogenous expression of CA IKK-2 and TD IκBα in the fibroblast cell line NIH3T3, we show that NF-κB signaling is critical for the induction of CCR3and eotaxin-1 in response to TNF-α. Using IκBα-deficient mice, we provide evidence that CCR3 andeotaxin-1 are physiological targets of NF-κB signalingin vivo and for their up-regulation in IκBα-deficient skin that may contribute to the skin pathology resembling atopic dermatitis. NIH3T3 (a kind gift from Dr. Garin-Chesa, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma KG), mouse embryonic fibroblasts, mouse dermal fibroblasts (isolation described below), and φNX amphotropic retrovirus producer cells (a kind gift from G. Nolan, Stanford, CA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (PAN Systems, Aidenbach, Germany), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For stimulation experiments human recombinant TNF-α (a gift from Dr. Adolf, Boehringer Ingelheim) was dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 200 mm sodium chloride, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and used at the indicated concentrations. At least 12 h prior to stimulation, the cells were held in starvation medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0,5% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For generation of stable transfectants of the NIH3T3 cell line, cells were electroporated (Bio-Rad gene pulser) with 20 μg of the 3xκB.luc reporter plasmid together with 1 μg of a pSV.puro vector (conferring resistance to puromycin) at 250 microfarad and 450 V. After electroporation, the cells were immediately resuspended in medium and seeded in 10-cm tissue culture plates. Cell clones with an integrated reporter gene were selected in medium containing 6 μg/ml puromycin with selection starting 48 h after electoporation. After 10–14 days single clones were picked and expanded. For measurement of luciferase activity cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined using the Lumat LB 9507 (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The pCFG5 IEGZ retroviral vector used for infection has been described earlier (23Kuss A.W. Knodel M. Berberich-Siebelt F. Lindemann D. Schimpl A. Berberich I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3077-3088Google Scholar). All cDNAs were inserted into bluntedEcoRI/BamHI sites. Mutant IκBα was provided by Patrick Baeuerle (Micromed, Munich, Germany) and the mutant IKK-2 cDNA by Alain Israel (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Sequences of retroviral vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. φNX producer cells plated at a density of 1 × 106/10-cm plate were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 10 μg of plasmid DNA as described (24Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Grignani F. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19Google Scholar). 24 h later, transfection efficiencies were determined by monitoring green fluorescent protein expression by fluorescence microscopy (Improvision, Heidelberg, Germany). Transfection efficiencies usually ranged between 70 and 80%. 24 h after transfection, 1 mg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) was added to the cells, which were then grown in the presence of this agent for another 2 weeks until all the cells were positive for green fluorescent protein. One day before infection, NIH3T3 cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2 × 105cells/well, and the φNX cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 106/10-cm plate. At the day of infection, φNX cell supernatant was obtained and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and 5 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) was added to the filtrate. Thereafter, medium was removed from NIH3T3 cells and replaced by φNX cell supernatant containing the retrovirus. Culture plates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 h, and supernatants then removed and replaced by conventional Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 48 h later the efficiency of infection was monitored by fluorescence microscopy as described above (infection efficiencies of NIH3T3 cells ranged between 80 and 90% depending on the retrovirus used), and selection with zeocin (1000 μg/ml) was started. Preparation of whole cell extracts was performed as described earlier (25Lernbecher T. Muller U. Wirth T. Nature. 1993; 365: 767-770Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, 50 μg of protein extracts/lane were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked with 7.5% dry milk in PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. For subsequent washes, 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS was used. The membranes were labeled with affinity-purified rabbit antiserum against IκBα or IKK-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Thereafter, the membranes were stained with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) that was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). As a loading control, the membrane was incubated with stripping buffer (40 min, 56 °C) and, after extensive washing with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20, labeled with rabbit polyclonal antibody against p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation with secondary donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody and washing with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20, chemiluminscent substrate was added, and the membrane was subjected to autoradiography (as described above). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described before (25Lernbecher T. Muller U. Wirth T. Nature. 1993; 365: 767-770Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted, and semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out as described earlier (10Huber M.A. Kraut N. Addicks T. Peter R.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 546-552Google Scholar). Mouse CCR3 was amplified with primers 5′-CAA CTT GGC AAT TTC TGA CCT G-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCA AAC ACA GCA TGG ACG ATA G-3′ (antisense; 37 cycles); mouse eotaxin-1 was amplified with primers 5′-CAA CAG ATG CAC CCT GAA AGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCC CTG AGA GCA CGT CTT AGG A-3′ (antisense; 37 cycles); mouse EF-1α was amplified with primers 5′-AGT TTG AGA AGG AGG CTG CT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAA CAA TCA GGA CAG CAC AGT C-3′ (antisense; 23 cycles); all primers were obtained from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). IκBα-specific primers were a kind gift from A. Beg (Columbia University, New York, NY) and were used for genotyping of IκBα knockout mice. Mice with a genetic deletion of IκBα have been described (26Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Google Scholar, 27Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt P.H. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2341-2349Google Scholar). The mice used here were a kind gift from Amer Beg (Columbia University). Genomic DNA was prepared from tails of 7-day-old pups and analyzed using IκBα-specific primers. Samples from the skin were taken and digested with trypsin (Invitrogen) for 30 min with occasional mixing. Afterward, the samples were further homogenized by pushing them through a syringe. Then the cells were seeded in a 10-cm tissue culture plate. The cells were grown for several weeks until they went through a crisis and were spontaneously transformed. Biopsy specimens of mouse skin were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Miles Inc., Elkhart,state), quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Cryostat sections (5 μm) were cut, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and fixed in cold acetone (4 °C) for 10 min. The avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase procedure was carried out as described before (28Garin-Chesa P. Rettig W.J. Melamed M.R. Old L.J. Niman H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3234-3238Google Scholar). The slides were incubated with goat polyclonal antibody against Eotaxin-1 and goat polyclonal antibody against CCR3 (both obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The sections were counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin. Some earlier reports had suggested a role of NF-κB in the regulation of eotaxin-1expression in airway epithelial cells (21Matsukura S. Stellato C. Plitt J.R. Bickel C. Miura K. Georas S.N. Casolaro V. Schleimer R.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6876-6883Google Scholar). We wanted to determine whether eotaxin-1 and CCR3 are inducibly expressed in fibroblasts and what role, if any, NF-κB signaling plays in such a scenario. To analyze CCR3 and eotaxin-1inducibility, we chose primary mouse embryo fibroblasts that were treated for 4 or 24 h with TNF-α. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of both genes was up-regulated upon stimulation with TNF-α and that stimulation for 24 h resulted in no further induction compared with stimulation for 4 h (Fig.1A). Similarly,CCR3 and eotaxin-1 were up-regulated in the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 upon addition of TNF-α. Although stimulation with TNF-α for 1 h resulted in only a weak induction of these two genes, a 4-h stimulation period resulted in high expression levels of CCR3 and eotaxin-1 (Fig.1B). These results provided a first hint that NF-κB signaling may be involved in the regulation of these two genes in fibroblasts. To correlate all subsequent modulations of the NF-κB signaling pathway directly to NF-κB function, we engineered NIH3T3 fibroblasts that stably express a luciferase gene under the control of multimerized κB-sites (Fig. 2A). Treatment of individual stably transfected clones with TNF-α resulted in a strong up-regulation of luciferase activity, and the best clone (clone 12) showed an almost 250-fold induction upon addition of TNF-α (Fig. 2B). This clone was then infected with retroviruses expressing either a TD IκBα protein (serines 32 and 36 are mutated to alanine), a constitutively active (CA) IKK-2 protein (two serines in the activation loop are mutated to glutamic acid residues), or an empty vector control (Fig. 2C). Stably infected cells could be visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy as the retroviruses coexpress enhanced green fluorescent protein. As shown in Fig.2D, the infection rate of NIH3T3 clone 12 cells with these three constructs was close to 90% even prior to selection. Expression of TD-IκBα and CA-IKK-2 was controlled by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 2E). This analysis revealed strong overexpression of the mutant proteins as compared with the endogenous counterparts. In the presence of high levels of exogenous TD-IκBα, expression of endogenous IκBα was barely detectable. This is most likely due to reduction in NF-κB activity, resulting in a decrease in IκBα synthesis. High levels of CA-IKK2 also resulted in decreased levels of endogenous IκBα. This can be explained by constitutive stimulation of IκBα phosphorylation, resulting in its degradation. Moreover, overexpression of CA-IKK-2, but not of TD-IκBα, resulted in slightly elevated levels of endogenous IKK-1 (Fig. 2E). The consequences of TD-IκBα and CA-IKK-2 expression on NF-κB activity were analyzed by luciferase assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Although NIH3T3 clone 12 cells stably infected with an empty vector showed a more than 100-fold induction of luciferase activity upon stimulation with TNF-α, cells infected with TD-IκBα displayed no significant luciferase activity, regardless of whether TNF-α was present or absent (Fig. 3A). In contrast, cells infected with CA-IKK-2 exhibited a high level of luciferase activity already in the absence of TNF-α (25-fold higher than empty vector-infected cells), which could not be further elevated upon addition of TNF-α. Similar results were obtained by monitoring DNA binding activity of NF-κB in these cells (Fig. 3B). In the presence of TD-IκBα, no detectable NF-κB DNA binding activity could be induced by TNF-α. In contrast, the CA-IKK-2 expressing cells showed already considerable NF-κB DNA binding activity in the absence of TNF-α, which was, however, further increased at the 4-h time point. We then asked whether this NF-κB modulation affected the inducible expression of CCR3 and eotaxin-1 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. RT-PCR analyses revealed that infection with the control vector did not affect the expression/induction of the transcripts of these two genes (Fig. 3C). In contrast, in cells infected with TD-IκBα protein, expression could not be induced by treatment of the cells with TNF-α. Importantly, cells expressing the CA-IKK-2 protein showed a high expression level of these two genes in the absence of TNF-α. After 4 h of TNF-α treatment, the inducible expression level was slightly increased further. These results demonstrate that activation of NF-κB is critical for the induction of CCR3 and eotaxin-1gene expression in fibroblasts and that selective activation of this pathway already partially activates expression of these genes. Given the critical role that NF-κB plays for CCR3 and eotaxin-1 expression, we asked whether expression of these genes is affected in dermal fibroblasts of mice lacking the IκBα protein. Mice bearing a homozygous mutation in the gene coding for IκBα die about 7–8 days after birth because of a massive myeloproliferative disorder (26Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Google Scholar). Fig.4A shows the genotyping of 7-day-old IκBα wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant mice (obtained by A. Beg, Columbia University). As already described (26Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Google Scholar,27Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt P.H. Chen C.H. Rosen C.A. Stewart C.L. Mol. Cell.

Next we analyzed skin sections (stained with hematoxylin-eosin) of 7-day-old wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/−), and homozygous null (−/−) animals. The wild-type skin (Fig.5A) displays the normal aspect of a 7-day-old murine skin with an intact epidermis comprising morphologically normal keratinocytes, a pronounced granular zone, and an orthokeratotic basket-woven stratum corneum. The dermis is well demarcated and reveals a texture of loosely woven collagen fibers and an intense infiltrate of numerous fibroblasts and histiocytes, as well as some lymphocytes and plasma cells, yet hardly any granulocytes. The zone of the subcutaneous fat tissue as well as the underlying muscle fibers are morphologically normal. The dermis and subcutaneous fat tissue present with a high amount of normally differentiated hair follicles and sebaceous gland units. Although skin from 7-day-old +/− pups (Fig. 5B) shows a variable slight increase in infiltrating leukocytes (that has not been described previously), no major difference in terms of the epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous architecture was noted. In contrast, a skin cross-section from an IκBα-deficient pup (Fig. 5C) differs notably from both the wild-type and heterozygous skin. Overall, there is a striking degree of architectural disorganization in particular with regard to the dermal and subcutaneous fat layer; the epidermal granular zone is less pronounced and the pattern of cornification is more stratified than basket-woven. The cutaneous/subcutaneous border is hardly discernible, and the subcutaneous fat tissue appears remarkably reduced, whereas the muscle bundles are well developed. The dermal connective tissue is interspersed by a dense infiltrate comprising fibroblasts, lymphocytes, granulocytes, and histiocytes. There is no epidermal spongiosis; however, there are several conspicuous intraepidermal neutrophilic microabscesses as well as a marked acanthosis and hyperkeratosis, that are in full accordance with the observations made by Beg et al. (26Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Google Scholar) and Klement et al. (27Klement J.F. Rice N.R. Car B.D. Abbondanzo S.J. Powers G.D. Bhatt P.H. Chen C.H.

This analysis revealed several interesting results (Fig.6A). First, the basal expression of both genes was higher in mutant fibroblasts as compared with wild type. A similar elevation of other cytokines and chemokines including granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, murine macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and TNF-α in IκBα-deficient pups has previously been described (26Beg A.A.

Second, the kinetics of the induction was altered, and both genes showed already full level expression after 1 h, whereas this full expression was only seen after 4 h in control fibroblasts.

Transfection of this cell line with a RII cDNA led to a stimulation of the transcriptional activity of p3TP-Lux, a TGF-β−responsive reporter construct. The RII transfectants (MIA PaCa-2/RII) showed a significant increase in sensitivity to radiation when compared with MIA PaCa-2/vector cells. The increase in sensitivity to radiation was reversed by neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β, indicating that these changes were dependent on TGF-β signaling. Compared with MIA PaCa-2/vector cells, MIA PaCa-2/RII cells showed a greater than 3-fold increase in apoptosis after radiation. Enhanced radiation sensitivity of MIA PaCa-2/RII cells was associated with an induction of Bax mRNA and protein that was followed by a release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage after radiation exposure. Overexpression of Bcl-xL or treatment with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeted against Bax significantly inhibited radiation-induced apoptosis in MIA PaCa-2/RII but not in MIA PaCa-2/Vector cells, suggesting that Bax induction is necessary for radiation-induced TGF-β signaling-mediated apoptosis. Thus, restoration of TGF-β signaling sensitized these cells to ionizing radiation, although these cells possess a mutated p53 gene. In addition, disruption of RII function by dominant negative mutant of RII inhibited the radiation-induced TGF-β signaling and apoptosis in primary cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Together, these observations imply that RII is an important component of radiation-induced TGF-β signaling, and loss of function of RII may enhance resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis.

Abnormal proliferation observed in cancer cells is caused by mutations that either increase positive growth signals or decrease negative growth control signals or do a combination of both. Molecular analysis reveals that greater than 90% of pancreatic carcinomas harbor point mutations of the c-Ki-ras-2 gene (1Berrozpe G. Schaeffer J. Peinado M.A. Real F.X. Perucho M. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The p16 gene, which encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor is reported to be mutated in greater than 80% of pancreatic cancers, and ∼75% of pancreatic carcinomas also possess mutations of the p53 gene (2Rozenblum E. Schutte M. Goggins M. Hahn S.A. Panzer S. Zahurak M. Goodman S.N. Sohn T.A. Hruban R.H. Yeo C.J. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1731-1734PubMed Google Scholar). The DPC4 gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene, is reported to be homozygously deleted in about 30% of pancreatic cancers and to be inactivated by intragenic mutations in another 20% of these cancers (3Schutte M. Hruban R.H. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Nadasdy G.M. Weinstein C.L. Bova G.S. Isaacs W.B. Cairns P. Nawroz H. Sidransky D. Casero Jr., R.A. Meltzer P.S. Hahn S.A. Kern S.E. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2527-2530PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies from our laboratory (4Freeman J.W. Mattingly C.A. Strodel W.E. J. Cell.

Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that another common feature of pancreatic cancer cells is a lack of negative growth response to TGF-β.1 Lack of response to TGF-β can be caused by mutations of its receptors (6Brattain M.G. Markowitz S.D. Willson J.K. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1996; 8: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), epigenetic changes that down-regulate receptor expression, or mutations affecting downstream targets of TGF-β including DPC4. Thus, pancreatic cancer is a molecularly complex disease. The role that the lack of TGF-β signaling plays in the resistance to therapy in pancreatic cancer is not well understood. TGF-β isoforms (TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3) are 25-kDa homodimer polypeptides that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation (7Moses H.L. Yang E.Y. Pietenpol J.A.

TGF-β molecules are potent inhibitors of growth in a variety of cells including epithelial, endothelial, and lymphoid cells (10Lyons R.M. Moses H.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). TGF-β is expressed in growth-arrested cells and in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and contributes to an orderly progression through the cell cycle (11Howell G.M. Sun L. Ziober B.L. Wu S.P. Brattain M.G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993; 12: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). TGF-β signals by binding to transmembrane serine-threonine kinases termed type I receptor (RI) and type II receptor (RII) (12Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 13Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence shows that both receptors are required for TGF-β signaling (13Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). A third receptor, type III (RIII), is not believed to be involved directly in TGF-β signaling but acts to present TGF-βs to RII (13Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). The TGF-β ligand binds first to the RII, and this receptor-ligand complex recruits and homodimerizes with RI. Subsequently, RI is activated by the type II receptor kinase that phosphorylates the glycine-serine-rich domain of RI. The activated type I receptor kinase then phosphorylates Smad2 or Smad3. Upon phosphorylation, a Smad2 or Smad3 homotrimer associates with the Smad4 (DPC4) homotrimer to form a heterohexamer that translocates to the nucleus (14Hu P.P. Datto M.B. Wang X.F. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 349-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Smad complex then associates with other co-factors including Fast-1, p300/CBP, and AP-1, forming a transcriptional active complex (14Hu P.P.

Further studies demonstrated that genetic alterations and/or down-regulation of TGF-β receptors play a critical role in altering responsiveness to TGF-β in cancer cells and indicate that RII is a tumor suppressor gene (6Brattain M.G. Markowitz S.D. Willson J.K. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1996; 8: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Wang J. Sun L. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S.

The mutations in simple repeat sequences of RII are caused by microsatellite instability in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (22Markowitz S. Wang J. Myeroff L. Parsons R. Sun L. Lutterbaugh J.

However, in contrast to hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, we did not find a significant number of mutations of the RII gene in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (25Venkatasubbarao K. Ahmed M.M. Swiderski C. Harp C. Lee E.Y. McGrath P. Mohiuddin M. Strodel W. Freeman J.W. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998; 22: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although microsatellite instability-directed mutations appear rare in the RII gene of pancreatic cancers (25Venkatasubbarao K. Ahmed M.M. Swiderski C. Harp C. Lee E.Y. McGrath P. Mohiuddin M. Strodel W. Freeman J.W. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998; 22: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), down-regulation of TGF-β receptors could be caused by epigenetic alterations. We found that all three receptors are expressed in most nontumor pancreas tissues (5Venkatasubbarao K. Ahmed M.M. Mohiuddin M. Swiderski C. Lee E. Gower Jr., W.R. Salhab K.F. McGrath P. Strodel W. Freeman J.W. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). RII was absent or expressed in low levels in more than half of the pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor tissues analyzed (5Venkatasubbarao K. Ahmed M.M. Mohiuddin M. Swiderski C. Lee E. Gower Jr., W.R. Salhab K.F. McGrath P. Strodel W. Freeman J.W. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, lack of expression ofRII may be responsible for a loss in response to negative growth regulation by TGF-β in pancreatic cancer cells that express the wild-type DPC4 gene. One of the molecular determinants regulating the response to ionizing radiation is the tumor suppressor protein p53, which serves as a pivotal component of the apoptosis pathway(s) in diverse cell types (26Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 27Lane D.P. Nature. 1992; 358: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4467) Google Scholar). The wild-type p53 protein is reported to effect radiation responsiveness in several types of cancers (28Chang E.H. Jang Y.J. Hao Z. Murphy G. Rait A. Fee Jr., W.E. Sussman H.H. Ryan P. Chiang Y.

Mutation of p53 is recognized as an important factor in poor prognosis of this disease and plays a role in the resistance of cancers to radiation and chemotherapy (1Berrozpe G. Schaeffer J. Peinado M.A. Real F.X. Perucho M. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 58: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 35Sato Y. Nio Y. Song M.M. Sumi S. Hirahara N. Minari Y. Tamura K.

Thus, the identification of p53-independent pathways that cause radiosensitization may result in a novel approach for therapy for radiation-resistant tumors. Similar to p53, TGF-β regulates cell growth and mediates growth control through the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (14Hu P.P. Datto M.B. Wang X.F. Endocr.

The human pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2 is highly tumorigenic and lacks RII expression (4Freeman J.W. Mattingly C.A. Strodel W.E. J. Cell.

In this study, we determined whether TGF-β signaling played a role in the radiation resistance of MIA PaCa-2 cells that possess a mutatedp53 gene. The results shown here demonstrate that restoration of TGF-β signaling by RII expression led to radiosensitization in the p53 mutant pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2. The pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). MIA PaCa-2 is a hypotriploid cell line established from a 65-year-old Caucasian male (40Yunis A.A. Arimura G.K. Russin D.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 19: 218-235Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We established limiting dilution clones from this cell line. We previously showed that one of these clones lacks expression of RII (4Freeman J.W. Mattingly C.A. Strodel W.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This limiting dilution clone was used in the present study. The nontransformed human epithelial cell line, Hs578N, obtained from ATCC was used as a normal control for mRNA expression of the TGF-βRII gene (5Venkatasubbarao K. Ahmed M.M. Mohiuddin M. Swiderski C. Lee E. Gower Jr., W.R. Salhab K.F. McGrath P. Strodel W. Freeman J.W. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). Primary cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells from normal mice at passage three (kindly provided by Dr. Tyler Jacks, Howard Hughes Medical Institute) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfection and selection of stable RII transfectants were done as previously described (21Wang J. Sun L. Myeroff L. Wang X. Gentry L.E. Yang J. Liang J. Zborowska E. Markowitz S. Willson J.K. Brattain M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22044-22049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The RII cDNA was cloned into a pRC/CMV expression vector. The plasmid (10 μg) was linearized withScaI and transfected by electroporation into the limiting dilution clone from MIA PaCa-2 cells. Electroporation was carried out at 250 V, 960 microfarads with a gene pulsar machine (Bio-Rad). Parental MIA PaCa-2 cells were similarly transfected with an empty vector pRC/CMV (10 μg). Cells were then selected based on neomycin resistance, and individual colonies were ring-cloned. Plasmid ΔRII, which functions as a dominant negative mutant for RII, contains serine kinase COOH terminus-defective RII cDNA cloned in a tetracycline-controllable expression system (41Ye S.C. Foster J.M. Li W. Liang J. Zborowska E. Venkateswarlu S. Gong J. Brattain M.G. Willson J.K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4725-4731PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection in primary MEF cells using ΔRII or ΔRII plus p3TP-LUC reported was performed as described previously (42Das A. Chendil D. Dey S. Mohiuddin M. Milbrandt J. Rangnekar V.M.

The transfected clones were screened for RII mRNA expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT-PCR was performed using a commercially available kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the protocol given by the manufacturer. The specific primers used to amplify regions of the RII gene are described by us elsewhere (5Venkatasubbarao K. Ahmed M.M. Mohiuddin M. Swiderski C. Lee E. Gower Jr., W.R. Salhab K.F. McGrath P. Strodel W. Freeman J.W. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 43-51PubMed Google Scholar). Total mRNA from a normal epithelial cell line, Hs578N, was used as a positive control for RII gene expression. Amplification of the β-actin gene using specific primers (44Ahmed M.M. Sells S.F. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S.M. Muthukkumar S. Harp C. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33056-33061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was used as an internal control and to normalize expression levels. The PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels in TBE stained with ethidium bromide. To determine whether RII expression restored TGF-β signaling, we measured TGF-β−responsive promoter activity using the p3TP-Lux assay (12Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently co-transfected with the p3TP-Lux reporter construct and Renilla luciferase reporter construct by LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated with recombinant TGF-β or irradiated at 5 Gy. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) using one freeze-thaw cycle. The levels of Fireflyand Renilla luciferases in the cell extract were assayed using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). TGF-β−responsive promoter activity was expressed as a ratio of firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity. A 100-kV industrial x-ray machine (Phillips) was used to irradiate the cultures at room temperature. The dose rate with a 2-mm aluminum plus 1-mm beryllium filter was ∼1.85 Gy/min at a focus-surface distance of 30 cm (44Ahmed M.M. Sells S.F. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S.M. Muthukkumar S. Harp C. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33056-33061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To quantitate apoptosis, the ApopTag in situ apoptosis detection kit (Oncor) was used as described (45Ahmed M.M. Venkatasubbarao K. Fruitwala S.M. Muthukkumar S. Wood Jr., D.P. Sells S.F. Mohiuddin M. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29231-29237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The ApopTag kit detects the DNA strand breaks in single cells by terminal transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin end labeling (TUNEL). To determine the response of MIA PaCa-2 transfectants to TGF-β−induced apoptosis, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. They were made quiescent by serum deprivation for 3 days and then exposed to exogenous TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) or 500 ng/ml anti-TGF-β-neutralizing antibody, AF-101-NA (R & D Systems), for 24 h. After 24 h, the DNA was tailed with digoxigenin-dUTP and conjugated with an anti-digoxigenin fluorescein. The cells were counterstained with propidium iodide and antifade. For a negative stained control, the cells were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline instead of terminal transferase. The stained specimen was observed in a triple band pass filter using a Nikon-Microphot™ epifluorescence microscope. To determine the percentage of cells showing apoptosis, 2000 cells were counted. Mean values were calculated from four replicates. To determine radiation-induced apoptosis, MIA PaCa-2 transfectants or transient ΔRII MEF transfectants were seeded in chamber slides and were exposed to a 5-Gy dose of radiation. Cell death was measured after 24 h by TUNEL staining as described above. Mean values were calculated from four replicates. For flow cytometry, cells were lifted by using nonenzymatic cell dissociation medium (Sigma), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 70% ethanol. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 5 μg/ml RNase and stained in 10 μg/ml propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACStar Plus™ cell sorter. Each histogram was constructed with the data from at least 10,000 events. Data from three independent experiments were analyzed to calculate the percentage of sub-G0 population (apoptosis) using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). The levels of radiation-induced TGF-β1 protein secreted in the culture supernatants of untreated and irradiated cells from MIA PaCa-2 transfectants were measured by ELISA. Microtiter ELISA plates were coated with anti-human TGF-β1 purified monoclonal antibody (R & D Systems) (capturing antibody). Then 100 μl of the culture medium supernatants were added to the plates and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The unbound materials were washed, and the plates were incubated with biotin-labeled anti-human TGF-β1 monoclonal (R & D Systems) secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the complex was conjugated with streptavidin peroxidase for 30 min at room temperature. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution was added for color reaction, and the optical density was measured at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader. For clonogenic cell survival studies, two different cell concentrations in quadruplet sets were used for each radiation dose. MIA PaCa-2/Vector, MIA PaCa-2/Vector.P2, MIA PaCa-2/RII, and MIA PaCa-2/RII.C9 cells were left untreated or exposed to a 1–5-Gy dose of radiation. To block TGF-β signaling, a neutralizing antibody to TGF-β1, anti-TGF-β1 antibody (AF-101-NA) (R & D Systems), was added (500 ng/ml of medium) to the cultures prior to irradiation. For control experiments, chicken immunoglobulin G (R & D Systems) was added before radiation. After incubation for 10 or more days, each flask was stained with crystal violet, and the colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted. The surviving fraction (SF) was calculated as a ratio of the number of colonies formed to the product of the number of cells plated and the plating efficiency (44Ahmed M.M. Sells S.F.

The curve was plotted using x-ylog scatter (Delta Graph® 4.0) and fitted by a single-hit multitarget model to obtain D0, n, and SF2 values. D0 is the dose required to reduce the fraction of cells to 37%, indicative of single-event killing. The n value of the curve is a measure of the width of the shoulder, indicative of multiple event killing. SF2is the survival fraction of exponentially growing cells that were irradiated at the clinically relevant dose of 2 Gy. The mitochondrial fractions from MIA PaCa-2 transfectants were prepared as per the protocol described previously (46Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4266) Google Scholar). Untreated and irradiated MIA PaCa-2 transfectants (5 × 105/ml) were harvested by centrifuging at 1800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellet was washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 μl of extraction buffer (220 mmmannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cells were broken by passing 15 times through a G23 needle. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 4 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm using an ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The resulting supernatant was used as a cytosolic extract, and the pellet was used as a mitochondrial fraction for cytochromec expression analysis. The cytosolic extract and mitochondrial fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (Biovision Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Total proteins were extracted from untreated, irradiated, recombinant TGF-β1-exposed, anti-TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody-exposed, or irradiated plus recombinant TGF-β1/anti-TGF-β1-neutralizing antibody-exposed cultures at various time points after the treatments using Laemmli buffer. Total proteins were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE and transferred to membrane. After blocking by milk, the membrane was incubated in a milk solution containing anti-p21waf1/cip1 monoclonal antibody, sc-817 or anti-Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody, sc-509 or anti-Bax monoclonal antibody, sc-7480 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-caspase-3 monoclonal antibody 3004, or anti-PARP monoclonal antibody 3001 (BioVision, Palo Alto, CA). The bound antigen-antibody complex was detected by secondary antibody (either monoclonal or polyclonal, depending upon primary antibody) and the chemiluminescence kit. The same membrane was u"

We have recently cloned four members of a highly conserved acyl-CoA thioesterase multigene family expressed in cytosol (CTE-I), mitochondria (MTE-I), and peroxisomes (PTE-Ia and -Ib), all of which are regulated via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (Hunt, M.

Sequence comparison revealed the presence of putative active-site serine motifs (GXSXG) in all four acyl-CoA thioesterases. In the present study we have expressed CTE-I in Escherichia coli and characterized the recombinant protein with respect to sensitivity to various amino acid reactive compounds. The recombinant CTE-I was inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and diethyl pyrocarbonate, suggesting the involvement of serine and histidine residues for the activity. Extensive sequence analysis pinpointed Ser232, Asp324, and His358 as the likely components of a catalytic triad, and site-directed mutagenesis verified the importance of these residues for the catalytic activity. A S232C mutant retained about 2% of the wild type activity and incubation with 14C-palmitoyl-CoA strongly labeled this mutant protein, in contrast to wild-type enzyme, indicating that deacylation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate becomes rate-limiting in this mutant protein. These data are discussed in relation to the structure/function of acyl-CoA thioesterasesversus acyltransferases. Furthermore, kinetic characterization of recombinant CTE-I showed that this enzyme appears to be a true acyl-CoA thioesterase being highly specific for C12–C20 acyl-CoAs.

Thus, the diversity of cellular processes involving activated fatty acyl-CoA esters underscores the central role of acyl-CoA thioesters in lipid metabolism.Acyl-CoA thioesterases are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of acyl-CoA thioesters to the corresponding free fatty acid and CoASH, and are therefore likely to regulate lipid metabolism as well as a number of cellular processes (for review, see Ref. 11Hunt M.C. Alexson S.E.H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; (in press)Google Scholar). This enzyme activity is widely distributed among organisms and shows multiple subcellular localizations. The enzyme activity is found in peroxisomes, mitochondria, cytosol, and endoplasmic reticulum and can be induced in liver by feeding peroxisome proliferators (12Miyazawa S. Furuta S. Hashimoto T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 117: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Berge R.K. Skrede S. Farstad M. FEBS Lett. 1981; 124: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Wilcke M.

These peroxisome proliferators (e.g. clofibrate) are potent modulators of lipid metabolism, and treatment of rodents with these compounds results in hypolipidemic effects and induction of fatty acid-catabolizing enzymes. The acyl-CoA thioesterase activity induced in mouse liver cytosol by treatment with these peroxisome proliferators is mainly because of induction of an ∼45-kDa protein called CTE-I (16Kawashima Y.

Cloning of the corresponding genes from mouse revealed a unique, highly conserved gene family encoding acyl-CoA thioesterases with putative expression in cytosol (CTE-I), mitochondria (MTE-I), and peroxisomes (PTE-Ia and -Ib), all of which can be regulated by feeding peroxisome proliferators and by fasting (22Hunt M.C.

Based on sequence similarity, these enzymes belong to a unique family of proteins that show sequence homology only to a bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT), which catalyzes the conjugation of bile acids to glycine or taurine. Still, however, the functions of these acyl-CoA thioesterases are largely unknown.So far, the best characterized thioesterases are thioesterases I and II, which are involved in chain termination of fatty acid synthesis by cleavage of the newly synthesized fatty acid from the fatty acid synthase complex (24Lin C.Y.

Chem. 1987; 262: 1570-1574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These thioesterases also hydrolyze acyl-CoAs and, similar to serine proteases, lipases, and cholinesterases, they have been proposed to contain a Ser-His-Asp/Glu catalytic triad, which catalyzes the ester hydrolysis. A nucleophilic serine is thought to be part of a charge-relay system along with a conserved histidine and an aspartic or glutamic acid residue (26Pazirandeh M. Chirala S.S. Wakil S.J. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18514-18519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Witkowski A. Naggert J. Witkowska H.E. Randhawa Z.I. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18488-18492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GXSXG motif seems to be conserved among esterases, and in mouse CTE-I Ser232 is found within a GXSXG motif. To gain further insight into the catalytic mechanism of the type I acyl-CoA thioesterases, we have characterized recombinant CTE-I with respect to chemical modifiers and used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the catalytic amino acid residues. Our results demonstrate that CTE-I is a member of the α/β hydrolase superfamily of esterases and that Ser232, Asp324, and His358 constitute the catalytic triad. Interestingly, the active-site serine is apparently replaced by a cysteine in the BAAT enzyme, which may mediate the different activities of these enzymes.RESULTSWe recently cloned four highly conserved members of a peroxisome proliferator-induced acyl-CoA thioesterase gene family (22Hunt M.C. Nousiainen S.E.B. Huttunen M.K. Orii K.E. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34317-34326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These genes encode putative mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and cytosolic thioesterases based on the presence or absence of targeting signals. The encoded proteins show high homology, and sequence comparisons show that they are closely related only to BAAT, an enzyme involved in conjugation of bile acids (34Falany C.N. Johnson S. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19375-19379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Falany C.N. Fortinberry H. Leiter E.H. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1139-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis identified a putative active-site serine within a consensus motif (Gly-Xaa-Ser/Cys-Xaa-Gly) frequently found in the active site of α/β hydrolases (36Ollis D. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S. Harel M. Remington S. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussmann J. Verscheuren K. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar). This superfamily of proteins is one of the largest known and includes esterases, lipases, transferases, thioesterases, haloperoxidases, lyases, etc. All of the enzymes in the α/β hydrolase superfamily share a common fold and harbor a catalytic triad formed by Ser/Cys, His, Asp/Glu. There is only one crystal structure available for a mammalian thioesterase, the palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1, shown to belong to the α/β hydrolase family (37Bellizzi J.J. Widom J. Kemp C. Lu J.-Y. Das A.K. Hofmann S.L. Clardy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4573-4578Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The presence of the GXSXG consensus motif suggests that also the type I thioesterases may conform to the paradigm of the α/β hydrolase fold. Furthermore, biochemical and site-directed mutagenic analyses have provided evidence for the involvement of a serine and a histidine residue in the catalytic triad of thioesterase II, an enzyme involved in termination of fatty acid synthesis (27Witkowski A. Naggert J. Wessa B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18514-18519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Witkowski A. Naggert J. Witkowska H.E. Randhawa Z.I. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18488-18492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When mouse type I thioesterase sequences were aligned to the mouse BAAT sequence (Fig.1), a reduced number of conserved carboxylic acid, serine, and histidine residues was identified that may constitute a catalytic triad in type I thioesterases and BAAT, although Ser232 aligned with a cysteine residue in BAAT. Fasta3 searches of the GenBankTM detected a number of proteins sharing significant overall sequence homology with mouse CTE-I (Fig.1). The alignment further suggested Ser232, Asp324, and His358 as a tentative triad, because these are the only residues of this type conserved in all of the sequences found. When each of the sequences shown in Fig. 1 was used to search for homologous proteins in the three-dimensional structure data bank, one of the Caenorhabditis elegansproteins (T16563) showed a distant but unequivocal homology with a bacterial dienelactone hydrolase of known three-dimensional structure (Protein Data Bank code 1DIN). This hydrolytic enzyme belongs to the α/β hydrolase superfamily, and therefore its evolutionary relationship to CTE-I confirms that this thioesterase also shares the α/β hydrolase fold. The sequence homology between 1DIN and CTE-I is too low to permit homology modeling, but a secondary structure prediction of CTE-I allowed us to identify some of the central elements of the fold in CTE-I. A partial secondary structure guided alignment of1DIN and CTE-I is shown in Fig. 2. A reduced number of conserved residues can be detected in strategic positions of the structure. Among these, Ser232, Asp324, and His358 in CTE-I aligned to the corresponding residues in the catalytic triad of 1DIN, further supporting the theory that these residues constitute the catalytic triad of CTE-I.Figure 2Secondary structure-guided partial alignment of mouse CTE-I and 1DIN. β-Strands (underlined) and α-helices (double underlined) in the structure of 1DIN(Protein Data Bank code) are indicated. Secondary structure elements predicted for CTE-I with the PHD PredictProtein program are indicated in the same manner. The asterisks denote identities, anddots indicate conservative substitutions. The nomenclature of these structurally conserved elements follows the recommendations for the α/β hydrolase superfamily (36Ollis D. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S. Harel M.

Alexson S.E.H. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12177-12183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Yamada J. Matsumoto I. Furihata T. Sakuma M. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To further investigate amino acids involved in the active site, recombinant mouse CTE-I protein was produced to characterize the enzyme with respect to sensitivity to common amino acid modifying reagents. The recombinant protein was found to be insensitive to the serine reactive agents DFP and BNPP when tested at concentrations up to 1 mm (Fig. 3A). However, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, another serine-reactive agent, inhibited the activity with an IC50 ≈ 0.5 mm(Fig. 3A). The histidine-reacting reagent diethyl pyrocarbonate was also found to abolish CTE-I thioesterase activity (Fig. 3A). These results are consistent with the presence of a Ser-His-Asp/Glu catalytic triad. In addition, the cysteine reducing reagent DTT had no effect on CTE-I thioesterase activity, whereaspCMB and DTNB were found to be potent inhibitors (Fig.3B), suggesting that a cysteine residue may be located near the active site.Figure 3Effects of chemical amino acid modifiers on mouse CTE-I thioesterase activity. Wild-type CTE-I was expressed in E. coli, and protein extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein extracts were incubated with the indicated compounds, and activity was measured with 25 μm myristoyl-CoA.

The myristoyl-CoA thioesterase activity of mouse CTE-I was measured in the presence of various concentrations of pCMB, DTT, and DTNB.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Site-directed Mutagenesis and Expression of Mouse CTE-IAs discussed above, multiple sequence alignments strongly suggested that Ser232, Asp324, and His358 constituted the active-site amino acids. Therefore, PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” to verify the identity of these amino acids as being part of the active site. Sequencing of all mutant plasmids verified the introduction of the correct mutations (shown in Table I), and wild-type and mutant plasmids were expressed in E. coli. Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity was measured in crude extracts using myristoyl-CoA, which is the best substrate for CTE-I. The specific activity of CTE-I wild-type enzyme in the crude extract was about 140 nmol/min/mg protein, as compared with ∼17 nmol/min/mg protein in non-expressing bacterial extracts (data not shown). Mutation of Ser232 to Ala, His358 to Gln, and Asp324 to Ala abolished the activity, suggesting that Ser232, Asp324, and His358 indeed constitute the active-site amino acids, whereas none of the other mutations had any major effect on activity (data not shown). Expressed His-tagged recombinant wild-type CTE-I, S232C, S232A, D324A, and H358Q were purified and characterized kinetically. Expression of the recombinant proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4), and these proteins were used for further kinetic characterization. TheVmax of wild-type CTE-I was about 1.2 μmol/min/mg protein when measured with palmitoyl-CoA, with a calculated Km of about 2.6 μm (TableII). However, the specific activities of the S232A, D324A, and H358Q were about 0.1 nmol/min/mg protein (when measured with 10 μm palmitoyl-CoA), which is about four orders of magnitude lower than the activity of the wild-type CTE-I. The activities of the mutants were at the base-line detection level for the assay, and more detailed kinetic studies could therefore not be performed. Interestingly, the S232C mutant retained about 2% of the wild-type activity, with a calculated Km of about 0.6 μm, suggesting that this mutant is still active as an acyl-CoA thioesterase, albeit with profoundly decreased activity. A possible explanation for the lower activity of the S232C mutant may be that the deacylation step becomes rate-limiting and that this mutant therefore becomes acylated as the acyl-enzyme intermediate. To test this possibility, we carried out experiments to compare acylation of the wild-type CTE-I and the various mutants.Figure 4SDS-PAGE analysis of expressed and affinity-purified wild-type and mutant CTE-I proteins used for kinetic characterization. Wild-type and single amino acid-specific mutants of CTE-I, as indicated, were expressed in E. coli after which each protein was purified using affinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 2–8 μg of protein was electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.

Neither wild-type CTE-I nor the S232A mutant contained any detectable incorporation of palmitate (Fig.5). However, the S232C mutant, which showed low palmitoyl-CoA thioesterase activity (see above) was strongly labeled with radioactive palmitate, and the H358Q and D324A mutants were also labeled, albeit much more weakly. Quantitation of the acylation (normalized to protein amount) showed that the H358Q D324A mutants contained about 14 and 10% radioactivity, respectively, of the labeling seen with the S232C mutant, whereas the wild-type CTE-I and the S232A mutants contained <2.6% (indistinguishable from background) of the radioactivity found in the S232C mutant. The incorporated fatty acids were covalently bound, as the labeling could be removed completely by treatment with neutral hydroxylamine (data not shown).Figure 5Acylation of wild-type and various mutants ofCTE-I. Wild-type (Wt) and mutated CTE-I cDNAs, as indicated, were expressed in E. coli, and bacterial extracts were prepared and incubated with 14C-palmitoyl-CoA. Aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and incorporation of 14C-palmitate was analyzed using a phosphorimaging device (upper panel). Aliquots were also analyzed by Western blotting, quantitated by scanning, and used to calculate the relative incorporation of radioactivity (lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Acyl-CoA Substrate Specificity of CTE-IPrevious studies on CTE-I (corresponding to ACH2 of Yamada et al.(19Yamada J. Matsumoto I. Furihata T. Sakuma M. Suga T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)) showed that the enzyme is inhibited at higher substrate concentrations. We therefore tested the addition of BSA to the incubations, which at a molar ratio of 1:4.5 showed a strong protective effect against substrate inhibition (data not shown). Therefore, albumin was added at a constant molar ratio of albumin to substrate when the acyl-CoA chain length specificity was tested with acyl-CoAs longer than lauroyl-CoA (C12-CoA). When measured at 10 μm substrate, CTE-I is active on saturated acyl-CoAs of 12–20 carbon atoms, with only very low activity with decanoyl-CoA as substrate (Fig. 6). Introduction of one or two double bonds decreased the activity to about half or less compared with the corresponding saturated acyl-CoA. However, the activity is negligible with arachidonoyl-CoA (C20:4), about 35-fold lower than the activity with arachidoyl-CoA (C20:0). A summary of Vmax andKm values with various acyl-CoAs is shown in TableIII. The highestVmax values were obtained with C12–C18 saturated and monounsaturated acyl-CoAs with Km values below 4.5 μm. We also tested a number of other acyl-CoA substrates (all measured at 10 μm) of varying structures; two methyl-branched chain acyl-CoAs, 4,8-dimethylnonanoyl-CoA and 2-methylstearoyl-CoA, which were both poor substrates. Also the β-oxidation intermediates 2-trans-decenoyl-CoA and 3-hydroxypalmitoyl-CoA were much poorer substrates than the corresponding saturated acyl-CoAs. Clofibroyl-CoA thioesterase activity has been reported to be localized mainly in cytosol and to be induced by clofibrate treatment in rats (39Berge R.K. Stensland E. Aarsland A. Tsegai G. Osmundsen H. Aarsæter N. Gjellesvik D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 918: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, CTE-I showed almost no activity with clofibroyl-CoA, which excludes CTE-I as the enzyme responsible for the activity seen in rodent liver. In addition, because of the sequence similarity between CTE-I and the BAAT enzyme (which uses choloyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA as substrates) we tested the activity of CTE-I with these bile acid intermediates. Somewhat surprisingly we did not detect any activity with choloyl-CoA or chenodeoxycholoyl-CoA. Furthermore, CTE-I showed no phospholipase A2 or diacylglycerol lipase activity. 3P. Larsson, personal communication. Taken together, the kinetic characterization suggests that CTE-I functions as a highly specific long-chain acyl-CoA thioesterase with very low activity for “bulky” substrates.Figure 6Kinetic characterization of recombinantCTE-I.

Given the defects seen in hair follicle development in both LEF-1 and Alx4 knockout and mutant animals and the overlapping expression patterns, we predicted that LEF-1 and Alx4 might form physical complexes. We demonstrate here the interaction between LEF-1 and Alx4. This interaction is mediated through a specific proline-rich domain in the N-terminal region of Alx4 and requires the DNA-binding domain (HMG-box) of LEF-1. We also demonstrate that LEF-1 and Alx4 can bind simultaneously to adjacent sites on the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) promoter and that this binding alters N-CAM promoter activity. Furthermore, when expressed in primary mammary stromal cells, Alx4 decreases the expression of endogenous N-CAM protein. These results reveal a potential mechanism that gives rise to mesenchymal-specific activities of LEF-1.

Vaahtokari A. Partanen A.M. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 35-50Google Scholar). Signaling between these layers governs organogenesis from initiation of tissue development to terminal differentiation of organ-specific cell types. The early stages of organogenesis are marked by the appearance of local epithelial thickenings followed by condensations of adjacent mesenchymal cells. This process is driven by a series of inductive reciprocal signals traveling between epithelial and mesenchymal cell compartments and resulting in the stepwise determination of both tissue components and, ultimately, formation of the adult organ. Development of teeth, whiskers, hair follicles, and mammary glands represent well studied examples of tissues that arise from these reciprocal signaling processes (2Hardy M.H.

Despite specialized structures and functions, common signaling cascades are required for the generation of these distinct tissues. The cascades are initiated and/or mediated by soluble factors such as the Wnt (5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1996; 11: 3286-3305Google Scholar, 6Millar S.E. Willert K. Salinas P.C. Roelink H.

Dev. 1996; 6: 432-438Google Scholar) of morphogens. In addition, development of the tissues critically depends on the expression and activity of a number of transcription factors associated with these signal transduction pathways. One critical factor, lymphoid enhancer-bindingfactor (LEF-1)1(13Milatovich A. Travis A. Grosschedl R. Francke U. Genomics. 1991; 11: 1040-1048Google Scholar) is a member of the high mobilitygroup (HMG)-box family of proteins, which includes the closely related factors Tcf-1, -2, -3, and -4. Although the expression and activity of members of this family overlap, LEF-1-null mice die shortly after birth, exhibiting (among other defects) a conspicuous absence of hair, teeth, whiskers, and mammary glands (14Travis A. Amsterdam A. Belanger C. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 880-894Google Scholar,15van Genderen C. Okamura R.M. Farinas I. Quo R.G. Parslow T.G. Bruhn L. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2691-2703Google Scholar). Forced expression of LEF-1 in mice under the control of the keratin-14 (K14) promoter causes abnormalities in the positioning and orientation of hair follicles as well as ectopic development of teeth (16Zhou P. Byrne C. Jacobs J. Fuchs E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 700-713Google Scholar). A requirement for the control of activity for other aspects of the pathways signaling through LEF-1 was demonstrated when K14-dependent expression of an activated version of the LEF-1-binding protein (β-catenin) resulted in de novo hair follicle development and, ultimately, malignant transformation of epithelial cells in the hair follicle (17Gat U. DasGupta R. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Cell. 1998; 95: 605-614Google Scholar). LEF-1 is a sequence-specific (5′-CCTTTG(A/T)(A/T)-3′) DNA-binding protein whose activity is modulated via cooperative interactions with non-DNA-binding cofactors such as β-catenin (18van de Wetering M.

Thus, apart from its ability to alter the conformation of DNA itself (33Giese K. Amsterdam A. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2567-2578Google Scholar), LEF-1 plays an architectural role in the assembly of multiprotein complexes (30Hsu S.C. Galceran J. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4807-4818Google Scholar, 34Giese K. Cox J. Grosschedl R. Cell. 1992; 69: 185-195Google Scholar), thereby facilitating the integration of multiple signal transduction pathways in the control of transcription. Proline-rich regions mediate protein-protein interactions between several classes of factors. We and others recently isolated a paired-like homeodomain protein, Alx4 (35Qu S. Niswender K.D. Ji Q. van der Meer R. Keeney D. Magnuson M.A. Wisdom R. Development. 1997; 124: 3999-4008Google Scholar, 36Qu S. Tucker S.C. Ehrlich J.S. Levorse J.M. Flaherty L.A. Wisdom R. Vogt T.F. Development. 1998; 125: 2711-2721Google Scholar), that harbors an N-terminal proline-rich motif predicted to mediate complex formation with other proteins. During murine embryogenesis, Alx4 expression is restricted to mesenchymal cells in developing bones, limbs, hair, whiskers, teeth, and mammary tissues (35Qu S. Niswender K.D. Ji Q. van der Meer R. Keeney D. Magnuson M.A. Wisdom R. Development. 1997; 124: 3999-4008Google Scholar, 37Hudson R. Taniguchi-Sidle A. Boras K. Wiggan O. Hamel P.A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 159-169Google Scholar). The Alx4-mutant mouse strain, Strong's luxoid (lstD), exhibits limb defects, cranio-facial abnormalities, temporary dorsal alopecia, and polydactyly (38Forsthoefel P.F. Fritts M.L. Hatzenbeler L.J. J. Morphol. 1966; 118: 565-580Google Scholar, 39Forsthoefel P.F. Teratology. 1972; 6: 5-17Google Scholar). Likewise, targeted deletion of Alx4 on a C57Bl/6 background resulted in mice with multiple abnormalities including polydactyly, dorsal alopecia, cranio-facial defects, and defects in body wall closure (36Qu S. Tucker S.C. Ehrlich J.S. Levorse J.M. Flaherty L.A. Wisdom R. Vogt T.F. Development. 1998; 125: 2711-2721Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that Alx4 and LEF-1 expression overlap spatially and temporally in many of these same tissues during mouse embryogenesis (37Hudson R. Taniguchi-Sidle A. Boras K. Wiggan O. Hamel P.A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 159-169Google Scholar). Because LEF-1 activity is required for the formation of tissues expressing Alx4, we hypothesized that LEF-1 interacts with Alx4 to regulate transcription of target genes. We demonstrate here the interaction between Alx4 and LEF-1 and show further that these two factors bind simultaneously to adjacent sites in the promoter region of the neural cell adhesion molecule, N-CAM. In addition, LEF-1 and Alx4 alter transcription from the N-CAM promoter, and Alx4 inhibits the expression of N-CAM protein when expressed in primary mammary mesenchymal cells. Murine LEF-1-HA cDNA and α-LEF-1 rabbit polyclonal antiserum were kindly provided by Dr. R. Grosschedl (Gene Center and Institute of Biochemistry, University of Munich, Germany). Myc-tagged LEF-1 was generated by inserting a Myc oligo (5′-CTCGAGCAGAAACTCATCTCTGAAGAGGATCTGTAGGTACC-3′) in place of the HA tag. LEF-1 mutant plasmids (ΔHMG and Δβcat) were a kind gift from Dr. L. Attisano (Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Canada) (40Labbe E. Letamendia A. Attisano L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8358-8363Google Scholar). Expression vectors for HA-tagged Alx4 were subcloned into pcDNA3 (37Hudson R. Taniguchi-Sidle A. Boras K. Wiggan O. Hamel P.A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 159-169Google Scholar). The GST fusion construct of Alx4 was generated by restriction digest of pcDNA3-HA-Alx4 (BamHI/SmaI) and subsequently cloned intoBamHI/SmaI sites of the pGEX-2T vector (41Wiggan O. Taniguchi-Sidle A. Hamel P.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 227-236Google Scholar). The mutant Alx4lstD expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. R. Wisdom (Departments of Biochemistry and Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN). The −1003 and −645 bp N-CAM-CAT reporter constructs were a kind gift of C. Goridis (Center d'Immunologie Institut National de la Sante, Marseille-Luminy, France). Additional deletion constructs were made by cutting at specified restriction sites and religating the vector. Sheep α-LEF-1 antiserum was obtained from Bionostics, Inc. (Toronto, Ontario). Monoclonal antibodies against Alx4 were described previously (37Hudson R. Taniguchi-Sidle A. Boras K. Wiggan O. Hamel P.A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 159-169Google Scholar). Two monoclonal antibodies, the mouse hybridoma (12CA5) and the rat anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used to detect the HA tag. The monoclonal antibody to N-CAM (5B8), developed by Thomas M. Jessel and Jane Dodd, was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA). The hybridoma 9E10 was used to generate antisera against the Myc epitope. The Alx4 adenovirus was constructed using the bacterial recombination system described by He et al. (42He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar). Briefly, HA-tagged Alx4 was ligated into the multiple cloning site of pCMV-AdTrack, and recombination with the pAdEasy vector was facilitated in BJ5183 cells. The recombinant adenoviral genome was then transfected into 293 cells, and it recovered viral particles used for subsequent rounds of amplification in 293 cells. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions as we have described previously (41Wiggan O. Taniguchi-Sidle A. Hamel P.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 227-236Google Scholar). An equivalent amount (1 μg) of purified GST or GST-Alx4Bam-Sma fusion protein bound to glutathione beads was incubated with COS-1 nuclear lysates containing LEF-1-HA protein and was rocked for 2 h at 4 °C. The glutathione beads were washed five times in a Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× SDS buffer for 5 min before loading onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. COS-1 cells were transfected with various expression constructs using the DEAE-dextran method. Cells were lysed 48-h post-transfection, and lysates were prepared in a Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and immunoprecipitated with sheep anti-LEF-1 antiserum. 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were then added and incubated for a further 2 h. Immunocomplexes were washed five times with ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and separated on 8% reducing SDS-PAGE gels. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, membrane blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% skim milk powder. Blots were incubated at room temperature for 2 h in a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody followed by a 1-h incubation with a 1:8000 dilution of the appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase antibody. Blots were developed with the ECL fluorescent detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Human C33A cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) as well as penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). For CAT assays, C33A cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Cells were harvested after 48 h, and CAT assays were performed as described previously (37Hudson R. Taniguchi-Sidle A. Boras K. Wiggan O. Hamel P.A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 159-169Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized relative to the internal control β-galactosidase. In all experiments, the total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant by including the appropriate empty expression vector. Data shown are from representative experiments that were done in triplicate, and the error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Nuclear lysates were prepared as described previously (43Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 176419Google Scholar). Gel shift reactions contained 15 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 0.8 μg of poly(dI-dC), 4 mm spermidine, 4 mm spermine, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 7.5% glycerol. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, 32P-labeled probe was added, the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min, and then antibodies were added and incubated for an additional 10 min. Samples were separated on 4% polyacrylamide gels that contained 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. The sequence of the gel shift probes are as follows (top strand): LEF1 site, 5′-GTGTCCACAACTTTGAAAATCGAACCGAAT-3′; P1 site, 5′-CTTTTTCCCCCTAATTATTAAAAACGTTCAA-3′; N-CAM probe: LEF-1 and P1 sites, 5′-CCACAACTTTGAAAATCGAACCGAATCTAAAATTCTTTTTCCCCCTAATTATTAAAAACG-3′. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin-embedded sections (6 μm) of paraformaldehyde-fixed embryos (E15.5). Rabbit antiserum against LEF-1 was used at 1:400 dilution. Supernatants of monoclonal antibodies against Alx4 and N-CAM were used undiluted. Secondary antibodies, α-rabbit-Texas Red and α-mouse-FITC (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), were used at 1:1000 dilution. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was carried out as described previously (44Fadel M.P. Szewczenko-Pawlikowski M. Leclerc P. Dziak E. Symonds J.M. Blaschuk O. Michalak M. Opas M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27083-27089Google Scholar) on a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal fluorescence microscope. We determined previously that expression of the paired-like homeodomain protein Alx4 is restricted to mesenchymal cells in a number of tissues whose development is critically dependent on the expression of the HMG-box protein, LEF-1 (37Hudson R. Taniguchi-Sidle A. Boras K. Wiggan O. Hamel P.A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 159-169Google Scholar). The presence of a proline-rich SH3-protein binding motif 2K. Boras, unpublished data. in the N-terminal region of Alx4 and the ability of LEF-1 to directly bind other transcription factors on DNA further suggested that LEF-1 and Alx4 might form co-complexes. This hypothesis was initially testedin vitro using GST pull-down assays (Fig.1). As illustrated, transiently expressed full-length HA-tagged LEF-1 in COS-1 cells binds specifically to GST-Alx4 but not to GST alone. Binding of LEF-1 to Alx4 was further characterized in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig.2). COS-1 cells were transiently co-transfected with the expression plasmids for HA-tagged Alx4 and HA-tagged LEF-1. LEF-1 was immunoprecipitated from nuclear lysates using an α-LEF-1 antibody, and co-immunoprecipitated HA-Alx4 was detected by Western analysis using the α-HA antibody, 12CA5 (Fig.2B, lane 2). When co-expressed, LEF-1 mediates co-immunoprecipitation of Alx4, confirming the results of the in vitro pull-down assay. The polyproline motif in the N-terminal region of Alx4 (PQPPTPQPPPAPPAPP, amino acids 92–107) bears a striking similarity to motifs in factors that mediate protein-protein interactions (46Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Google Scholar). This region was examined for its possible role in Alx4 interaction with LEF-1 (Fig. 2). Constructs expressing various deletions of Alx4 (Fig.2A) were co-transfected with the LEF-1-myc expression vector. All mutants of Alx4 are co-expressed with LEF-1 in the nucleus (Fig. 2A). LEF-1 was immunoprecipitated using sheep polyclonal antisera directed against full-length LEF-1 and co-immunoprecipitated Alx4 detected by Western analysis using a rat α-HA monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2B). All mutants of Alx4 that retain the SH3 protein-binding motif co-immunoprecipitate with LEF-1. However, Alx4ΔWW, which harbors a deletion between amino acids 87 and 115, did not co-immunoprecipitate LEF-1 despite being expressed at slightly higher levels than the other Alx4 mutant proteins (Fig. 2B, middle panel). Thus, the SH3 protein-binding motif of Alx4 is required for its interaction with LEF-1. The C-terminal proline-rich domain (amino acids 294–327), the highly conserved paired-tail motif (amino acids 375–391) (47Mathers P.H. Grinberg A. Mahon K.A. Jamrich M. Nature. 1997; 387: 603-607Google Scholar), as well as the sequence N-terminal to the SH3 protein-binding motif in Alx4 are not required for strong association with LEF-1. Fig. 2C reveals further that, distinct from β-catenin, Alx4 appears to bind to the domain responsible for LEF-1 binding to DNA, the HMG-box. Specifically, wild-type LEF-1 or LEF-1 that lacks the β-catenin binding site (Δβcat) or the HMG-box (ΔHMG) were co-transfected with Alx4. Immunoprecipitation of wild-type LEF-1 or the Δβcat mutant co-immunoprecipitated Alx4. However, the ΔHMG mutant, which was expressed at levels similar to wild-type LEF-1, failed to immunoprecipitate Alx4. Mice that are mutant for either Alx4 or LEF-1 exhibit a number of similar developmental defects, including that of hair follicles (15van Genderen C. Okamura R.M. Farinas I. Quo R.G. Parslow T.G. Bruhn L. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2691-2703Google Scholar, 38Forsthoefel P.F. Fritts M.L. Hatzenbeler L.J. J. Morphol. 1966; 118: 565-580Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed previously that expression of message for these two factors overlaps significantly (37Hudson R. Taniguchi-Sidle A. Boras K. Wiggan O. Hamel P.A. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 159-169Google Scholar). N-CAM expression during hair follicle development has been shown previously to be very dynamic, being detectable in mesenchymal cells and/or epithelial cells at distinct stages of the hair follicle cycle (48Muller-Rover S. Peters E.J. Botchkarev V.A. Panteleyev A. Paus R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 1401-1410Google Scholar, 49Hardy M.H. Vielkind U. Acta Anat. 1996; 157: 169-182Google Scholar). As we demonstrate in Fig. 3, N-CAM is expressed in an overlapping pattern with LEF-1 in the invaginating epithelial cells and is excluded from the dermal papilla where Alx4 is expressed. Regulation of N-CAM expression by these factors is further supported by the observation that noggin-dependent induction of LEF-1 coincidentally increases N-CAM expression (50Botchkarev V.A. Botchkareva N.V.N.V. Roth W. Nakamura M. Chen L.H. Herzog W. Lindner G. McMahon J.A. Peters C. Lauster R. McMahon A.P. Paus R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 158-164Google Scholar). Furthermore, our inspection of the promoter region of N-CAM revealed two putative LEF-1 consensus binding sequences (CTTTG(A/T)(A/T) (14Travis A. Amsterdam A. Belanger C. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 880-894Google Scholar, 33Giese K. Amsterdam A. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2567-2578Google Scholar, 34Giese K. Cox J. Grosschedl R. Cell. 1992; 69: 185-195Google Scholar); see Fig.4A), one of which (position −589) is adjacent to an AT-rich sequence encoding the palindromic P1 paired-like homeodomain binding sequence, TAATtATTA (51Wilson D. Sheng G. Lecuit T. Dostatni N. Desplan C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2120-2134Google Scholar, 52Wilson D.S. Guenther B. Desplan C. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1995; 82: 709-719Google Scholar). Alx4 monomers have been shown to bind with high affinity to a portion of this site, specifically TAATt (53Tucker S.C. Wisdom R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32325-32332Google Scholar).Figure 4Alx4 and LEF-1 regulate N-CAM promoter activity.A, schematic representation of the mouse N-CAM promoter. Nucleotides are numbered relative to the transcription start site. Filled boxes indicate putative LEF-1 and Alx4 binding sites. B, LEF-1-dependent activation of the N-CAM promoter. C33A were transiently transfected with a series of 5′-deletion N-CAM promoter constructs (50 ng) with or without Myc-tagged LEF-1 (2 μg). C, C33A were transiently transfected with the N-CAM ΔNde-CAT reporter construct, together with LEF-1 (0.5 μg) and/or LEF-1ΔHMG and/or LEF-1Δβcat (0.5, 2 μg). D, Alx4 regulates LEF-1 activation of the N-CAM promoter. C33A cells were transiently transfected with the N-CAM ΔNde-CAT reporter construct, together with increasing amounts of Alx4 and/or LEF-1 expression plasmids (0.1, 0.5, 2 μg). E, Alx4 regulates LEF-1 activity by DNA binding and its interaction with LEF-1. C33A cells were transiently transfected with the N-CAM ΔNde-CAT reporter construct, together with Alx4 or Alx4lstD (2 μg) and/or LEF-1 (0.5 μg) expression plasmids. Cell lysates in B, C, D, andE were assayed for CAT activity and normalized to β-galactosidase activity 48 h after transfection. Experiments were repeated five times in triplicate. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Thus, using a series of 5′-deletion N-CAM promoter constructs, we determined the effect of LEF-1 expression on N-CAM promoter activity (Fig. 4B). In the absence of LEF-1, N-CAM promoter activity increased when the sequence between −647 and −1003 bp (ΔNdeI) was deleted. When an additional 58 bp were removed (ΔHinf) the region encoding the distal LEF-1 consensus sequence, promoter activity decreased to half of the activity seen for the ΔSspI construct. Further deletion decreased activity to levels that approach background. Co-transfection of the ΔSsp N-CAM promoter-CAT construct with 2.0 μg of the LEF-1 expression vector increased N-CAM promoter activity by 2-fold. This increase was also evident for the ΔNde mutant where both LEF-1 binding sites were intact. However, further deletion of 58 bp (ΔHinf) to just upstream of the putative P1 binding site (with the deletion of the distal LEF-1 consensus binding site) prevented LEF-1 from activating the N-CAM promoter, indicating that the upstream sequence was the principal site for LEF-1-dependent N-CAM promoter activation. Furthermore, transfection with the LEF-1 DNA-binding mutant (ΔHMG) and a dominant-negative LEF-1 mutant unable to bind β-catenin (Δβcat) did not activate the N-CAM promoter (Fig. 4C). We next examined the effect of N-CAM promoter activity in the presence of expressed LEF-1 and Alx4 (Fig. 4D). Cells were transiently transfected with the N-CAM ΔNde-CAT reporter construct together with increasing amounts of Alx4 or LEF-1 expression plasmids. Expression of LEF-1 strongly activated the N-CAM promoter up to 12-fold over basal activity. Alx4 weakly stimulated promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. When the two expression plasmids were co-transfected, low levels of Alx4 reproducibly enhanced LEF-1-dependent N-CAM promoter activation. However, as higher levels of Alx4 were expressed, LEF-1-dependent activation was repressed (Fig. 4D). Transfection of the DNA binding-deficient mutant derived from lstD mice (Alx4lstD) failed to alter LEF-1-dependent N-CAM activity (Fig. 4E). Given the proximity of the LEF-1 and Alx4 binding site consensus sequences and the ability of these proteins to interact with one another, we examined whether the two proteins bind these sites on the N-CAM promoter simultaneously (Fig.5). EMSAs were performed using a labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe encoding the sequence between −595 and −535 of the N-CAM promoter (Fig. 5A). As thelower panel of Fig. 5A demonstrates, nuclear lysates containing exogenous Myc-tagged LEF-1 produced a novel complex (lane 1, C4), which was specifically supershifted with the α-Myc monoclonal antibody, 9E10 (lane 2,C2). Competition with 200-fold excess cold N-CAM oligo abrogated the LEF1-DNA complexes (lanes 3 and 4). As we and others have shown previously (36Qu S. Tucker S.C. Ehrlich J.S. Levorse J.M. Flaherty L.A. Wisdom R. Vogt T.F. Development. 1998; 125: 2711-2721Google Scholar, 37Hudson R. Taniguchi-Sidle A. Boras K. Wiggan O. Hamel P.A. Dev.

Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 1136-1145Google Scholar). The structures of CGTases are organized in five domains (A–E). The N-terminal part consists of the catalytic (β/α)8-barrel fold (domain A) with a loop of ∼60 residues protruding at the third β-strand (domain B). Domains A and B together form the substrate binding groove and contain the catalytic site residues (8Klein C. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 737-750Google Scholar, 13Strokopytov B. Knegtel R.M. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4241-4249Google Scholar). Domains C and E are involved in starch binding (14Penninga D. van der Veen B.A. Knegtel R.M. van Hijum S.A.F.T. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32777-32784Google Scholar), whereas the function of domain D remains to be elucidated. The substrate binding groove of the BC251 CGTase consists of at least nine sugar binding subsites (13Strokopytov B. Knegtel R.M. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4241-4249Google Scholar), labeled −7 to +2, with bond cleavage occurring between subsites −1 and +1. Fig. 1 gives an overview of the interactions between the enzyme and a maltononaose substrate and shows the binding mode of this maltononaose in the active site of CGTase. CGTase uses an α-retaining double displacement mechanism to catalyze four different reactions, cyclization, coupling, disproportionation, and hydrolysis. The cyclization (and disproportionation) reactions start with the binding of a linear malto-oligosaccharide substrate, followed by cleavage of the α-(1,4)-glycosidic bond between the residues bound at subsites +1 and −1, resulting in an intermediate that is covalently linked to Asp-229 (15Mosi R. He S. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Dijkstra B.W. Withers S.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9927-9934Google Scholar, 16Uitdehaag J.C.M. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Google Scholar). Subsequently, the non-reducing end moves from subsite −7 (for β-cyclization) into subsite +1. This step is called circularization, which is followed by intramolecular bond formation. Circularization is most likely the rate-determining step in the cyclization reaction (17van der Veen B.A. van Alebeek G.J. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 658-665Google Scholar, 18Uitdehaag J.C.M. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Elber R. Dijkstra B.W. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2001; 43: 327-335Google Scholar). In the disproportionation reaction the non-reducing end of a second sugar molecule is used as acceptor. CGTase also catalyzes the reverse reaction of cyclization, which is called the coupling reaction. In this reaction a cyclodextrin ring is opened, and the resulting covalently bound, linear oligosaccharide is transferred to a second sugar molecule, the acceptor. Besides these three transglycosylation reactions, CGTase catalyzes the hydrolysis of α-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds in starch. Interestingly, the hydrolysis activity of CGTase is much lower than its transglycosylation activities, making the enzyme an efficient transferase (3Penninga D. Strokopytov B. Rozeboom H.J. Lawson C.L. Dijkstra B.W. Bergsma J. Dijkhuizen L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3368-3376Google Scholar). Of all reaction types, the disproportionation reaction is most efficiently catalyzed by CGTase (17van der Veen B.A. van Alebeek G.J. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 658-665Google Scholar, 19Nakamura A. Haga K. Yamane K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 66-70Google Scholar). The high transferase activity of CGTase was investigated recently by comparing x-ray structures of CGTase representing different stages of its reaction cycle (20Uitdehaag J.C.M. van Alebeek G.J. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7772-7780Google Scholar). From these studies it appeared that the protein backbone of CGTase can undergo small but significant conformational changes after binding of substrate sugars at the acceptor subsites +1 and +2 and at the donor subsites −3 and −6. The conformation of Asn-139 and His-140 is changed only if sugars are simultaneously bound at these subsites (21Uitdehaag J.C.M. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34868-34876Google Scholar). This enables His-140 to make a hydrogen bond to the O-6 atom of the −1 sugar (see Fig.1A) and helps to distort the −1 sugar toward transition state planarity (16Uitdehaag J.C.M. Mosi R. Kalk K.H. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L. Withers S.G. Dijkstra B.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 432-436Google Scholar, 20Uitdehaag J.C.M. van Alebeek G.J. van der Veen B.A. Dijkhuizen L.

It was suggested that in this way, these distant sugar binding subsites communicate the presence of long oligosaccharide substrates and acceptors and ensure that they are preferentially processed. Support for this mechanism has come from site-directed mutagenesis experiments of the residues in the acceptor subsites and of His-140 (22van der Veen B.A. Leemhuis H. Kralj S. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44557-44562Google Scholar, 23Nakamura A. Haga K. Yamane K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9929-9936Google Scholar, 24Nakamura A. Haga K. Yamane K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6624-6631Google Scholar). Subsite −6 has not been studied so far, but its position far from the catalytic site (see Fig. 1B) makes it unlikely that the mutants interfere directly with the catalytic process. Instead, they may affect substrate binding or the proposed induced-fit mechanism, providing an excellent opportunity to test whether distant subsites play a role in regulating transglycosylation activity. At present there are no mutagenesis data concerning subsite −6. Because this subsite is identical in all known CGTases, subsite −6 must be important for the function and the unique characteristics of CGTase. We constructed mutants that block subsite −6 (G179L, G180L, and G179L/G180L) or that abolish interactions at subsite −6 (Y167F, N193G, and N193L). Here we report a kinetic analysis of these mutants. The results obtained show that subsite −6 has an important function in all three transglycosylation reactions. They provide new insights in the catalytic mechanism employed by CGTase. Crystals of mutant BC251 CGTases were grown from 60% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 100 mmHEPES (pH 7.5) and 5% (w/v) maltose (9Lawson C.L. van Montfort R. Strokopytov B. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. de Vries G.E. Penninga D. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 590-600Google Scholar). Soaking of N193G crystals with acarbose was carried out as described earlier (13Strokopytov B. Knegtel R.M. Penninga D. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4241-4249Google Scholar). For G179L data were collected to 1.94 Å at 120 K on an in-house MacScience DIP2030H image plate (Nonius, Delft, The Netherlands) using CuKa radiation from a Nonius FR591 rotating-anode generator with Franks' mirrors. Processing was done with DENZO and SCALEPACK (25Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Data Collection and Processing. SERC Laboratory, Daresbury, United Kingdom1993: 56-62Google Scholar). The structure of CGTase liganded with maltotetraose (PDB code 1CXF), with all waters and sugars removed, was used as a starting model. Refinement was done with the Crystallography & Nuclear Magnetic Resonance System (26Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiamg J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) in a standard way. The compression of the longest cell axis of G179L compared with that of N193G (TableI) is because of a locally changed crystal packing at the maltose binding site near Trp-616 and Trp-662. This has improved the crystal quality, as shown by the increased resolution of the data at the in-house source and the low overall B-factor of structure and the low R-factors. For N193G data were collected to 2.43 Å at room temperature on a MacScience DIP2020 imaging plate mounted on an Elliot GX21 rotating-anode generator producing CuKa radiation. Data were reduced and scaled using the program XDS (27Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Google Scholar) and programs from the Groningen BIOMOL software package. Sugar ligands were manually placed in sigmaA-weighted 2Fo − Fc andFo − Fc electron density maps with the program O (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Plasmid-carrying strains were grown on LB medium at 37 °C in the presence of kanamycin, 50 or 5 μg/ml for E. coli or B. subtilis, respectively. Transformation of B. subtilis was done according to Bron (31Bron S. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Modern Microbiological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 146-147Google Scholar). Mutant CGTases were constructed via a double PCR method using Pwo-DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (3Penninga D. Strokopytov B. Rozeboom H.J. Lawson C.L. Dijkstra B.W. Bergsma J. Dijkhuizen L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3368-3376Google Scholar). The PCR product was cut with PvuII and SalI and exchanged for the corresponding fragment of pDP66k−. The following oligonucleotides were used to introduce the mutations: 5′-CTCGGGGGATTCACGAACGATACGCAAAACCTG-3′ (Y167F), 5′-CTACAAAGGCCTGTACGATCTCGCAGATCTGAACCATAAC-3′ (N193G), 5′-CTACAAACTCCTGTACGATCTCGCAGATCTGAACCATAAC-3′ (N193L), 5′-GTTCCACCATAACCTAGGCACGGACTTTTCCACG-3′ (G179L), 5′-GTTCCACCATAACGGGTTAACGGACTTTTCCACG-3′ (G180L), and 5′-GTTCCACCATAACCTGTTAACGGACTTTTCCACG-3′ (G179L/G180L). Successful mutagenesis resulted in the appearance of the underlined restriction sites as follows: BlnI for G179L, HincII for G180L and G179L/G180L, andBglII for N193G and N193L. Mutation Y167F removed anXmnI restriction site. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the complete PvuII/SalI fragment obtained with PCR. Cycle sequencing (32Murray V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 178889Google Scholar) was performed on double stranded DNA using the Thermo Sequence fluorescent primer cycle sequence kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Sequence reactions were run on the Amersham Biosciences, Inc. ALF-Express sequencing machine at the BioMedical Technology Center (Groningen, The Netherlands). CGTase proteins were produced and purified as described before (3Penninga D. Strokopytov B. Rozeboom H.J. Lawson C.L. Dijkstra B.W. Bergsma J. Dijkhuizen L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3368-3376Google Scholar). All enzyme assays were performed in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 50 °C. Cyclization activities were determined by incubating 0.1–0.5 μg/ml enzyme with 2.5% (w/v) Paselli SA2 starch (partially hydrolyzed potato starch with an average degree of polymerization of 50; AVEBE, Foxhol, The Netherlands), as described by Penninga et al. (14Penninga D. van der Veen B.A. Knegtel R.M. van Hijum S.A.F.T. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32777-32784Google Scholar). Cyclodextrin product specificity under industrial process conditions was measured by incubating 10% (w/v) Paselli WA4 starch (pregelatinized drum-dried starch with a high degree of polymerization; AVEBE) with 2 units/ml of enzyme activity (1 unit is μmol min−1 β-cyclodextrin-forming activity per mg of protein). Samples were taken at regular intervals, boiled for 10 min, and analyzed by HPLC, as described below. Coupling activities were measured as described by Nakamura et al. (24Nakamura A. Haga K. Yamane K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6624-6631Google Scholar), with some modifications (33van der Veen B.A. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Penninga D. van Alebeek G.J. Smith L.M. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1027-1038Google Scholar), with α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrin as donor substrates and methyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (MαDG) as acceptor substrate, using 0.1–0.5 μg/ml enzyme. Values of kcatand Km were determined by measuring rates at 5 donor and 5 acceptor substrate concentrations (25 conditions) ranging from 0.2 to 5 times the Km values. Disproportionation activity was determined as described by Nakamuraet al. (19Nakamura A. Haga K. Yamane K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 66-70Google Scholar), with some modifications (33van der Veen B.A. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Penninga D. van Alebeek G.J. Smith L.M. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1027-1038Google Scholar), using 0.1–0.5 μg/ml enzyme, 4-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltoheptaoside-4–6-O-ethylidene (EPS; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or 4-nitrophenyl-α-d-maltopentaoside (G5-pNP; Megazyme, County Wicklow, Ireland) as donor substrate and maltose as acceptor substrate. With the EPS substrate, values of kcat andKm were determined by measuring rates at 6 donor and 5 acceptor substrate concentrations (30 conditions) ranging from 0.2 to 5 times the Km values. With the G5-pNP substrate, values of kcat and Km were determined by measuring rates at 12 different donor concentrations at fixed maltose concentration (10 mm). Hydrolyzing activity was determined as described before (3Penninga D. Strokopytov B. Rozeboom H.J. Lawson C.L. Dijkstra B.W. Bergsma J. Dijkhuizen L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3368-3376Google Scholar) by measuring the increase in reducing power upon incubation of 5 μg of enzyme with 1% (w/v) soluble starch (Lamers & Pleuger, Wijnegen, Belgium). Products formed were analyzed by HPLC, using an Econosphere NH2 5 u column (250 × 4.6 mm) (Alltech Nederland bv; Breda, The Netherlands) linked to a refractive index detector. A mobile phase of acetonitrile/water (60:40) (v/v) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used. The results obtained for the coupling and disproportionating reactions were analyzed using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). The coupling reaction followed the random order ternary complex mechanism (17van der Veen B.A. van Alebeek G.J. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 658-665Google Scholar). The disproportionating reaction proceeded via the substituted enzyme mechanism (or ping-pong mechanism) (19Nakamura A. Haga K. Yamane K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 66-70Google Scholar). The G179L structure had a maltotetraose ligand bound from subsites +2 to −2 with the glucose at subsite −1 in its β-anomeric configuration. Because the G179L crystals were not soaked with sugars, the maltotetraose sugar must be the remainder of α-cyclodextrin used for the purification of the enzyme. This mutant has indeed a very low coupling activity (see Table V). The G179L structure also had a glucose molecule bound at the surface near Gln-287, Arg-290, Arg-294, Asp-295, and Glu330, about 8 Å from subsite +2. A sugar at this position was not seen before. Its functional relevance for the enzyme is not known. The φ/ψ angles of the mutated residue 179 were 66/−151 compared with 97/−162 in the wild-type enzyme (PDB code 1CDG). The protein backbone conformation was hardly affected by this mutation, however. The N193G structure had an acarbose molecule bound from subsites +2 to −2. The φ/ψ angles of the mutated residue were hardly changed, −72/150 compared with −60/145 in wild-type (PDB code 1CDG), and the protein backbone conformation was not significantly altered. In both structures the Asn-139/His-140 conformation is identical to that of the unliganded wild-type CGTase (34Knegtel R.M. Strokopytov B. Penninga D. Faber O.G. Rozeboom H.J. Kalk K.H. Dijkhuizen L. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29256-29264Google Scholar), as expected for structures that have no sugar bound at the −6 subsite.Table VKinetic parameters of the coupling reactions catalyzed by wild-type and mutant cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases from B. circulans strain 251KM,CDKM,MαDGK′M,CDK′M,MαDGkcatmms−1α-CD Wild-type2.2 ± 0.30.45 ± 0.055.3 ± 1.21.1 ± 0.3240 ± 7 G179LND5-aND, not detectable.NDNDND<0.1 G180L5.4 ± 0.310 ± 1.32.8 ± 0.25.2 ± 1.1196 ± 11 G179L/G180LNDNDNDND<0.1β-CD Wild-type0.32 ± 0.0218.1 ± 1.40.15 ± 0.048.5 ± 2.2368 ± 10 G179L0.57 ± 0.055.0 ± 11.25 ± 0.2011 ± 395 ± 4 G180L0.59 ± 0.07245 ± 180.28 ± 0.03116 ± 14233 ± 10 G179L/G180LNDNDNDND<0.1 Y167F0.29 ± 0.0316.2 ± 1.80.23 ± 0.0312.7 ± 2.5326 ± 14 N193G0.39 ± 0.0552.2 ± 60.41 ± 0.0554.9 ± 12104 ± 6 N193L0.38 ± 0.0516.7 ± 10.22 ± 0.029.7 ± 1.7331 ± 16γ-CD Wild-type0.13 ± 0.0216.6 ± 3.00.12 ± 0.0315.7 ± 6.1188 ± 11.3 G179LNDNDNDND<0.1 G180L0.12 ± 0.0238 ± 30.46 ± 0.05146 ± 983 ± 5 G179L/G180LNDNDNDND<0.15-a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab The cyclization activities of the (mutant) CGTases are summarized in TableII. Substrate affinity values are not reported, because at the low substrate concentrations needed the amount of cyclodextrin formed is too low for reliable activity measurements. Low starch concentrations are needed, because BC251 CGTase has a high affinity for starch (<0.5 mg/ml) (17van der Veen B.A. van Alebeek G.J. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Dijkstra B.W. Dijkhuizen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 658-665Google Scholar). All subsite −6 mutants have reduced β-cyclodextrin-forming activities, most pronounced for mutations that introduce a leucine at position 180 (G180L and G179L/G180L) or remove a side chain at position 193 (N193G) (Table II). Gly-180 is most important for β-, γ-, and δ-cyclodextrin formation, whereas the G179L mutation especially affects α-cyclization. Mutant N193L is only slightly affected in its cyclization activities. The N193G mutation, in contrast, specifically decreases β-cyclodextrin formation. Thus, subsite −6 plays an important role in the cyclization reactions catalyzed by CGTase.Table IICyclization and hydrolyzing activities of wild-type and mutant cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases from B. circulans strain 251 on starchkcat α-CDkcatβ-CDkcat γ-CDkcatδ-CDkcat Hydrolysiss−1Wild-type17.0 ± 1.0338 ± 261 ± 236.2 ± 0.84.0 ± 0.2G179L8.8 ± 0.3269 ± 352 ± 224.9 ± 0.53.9 ± 0.2G180L25.5 ± 0.477 ± 124 ± 111.1 ± 0.33.9 ± 0.2G179L/G180L21.4 ± 0.481 ± 120 ± 112.0 ± 0.44.0 ± 0.2Y167F19.5 ± 0.8278 ± 950 ± 329.3 ± 1.53.5 ± 0.3N193G25.8 ± 0.9166 ± 564 ± 531.1 ± 1.34.3 ± 0.3N193L19.3 ± 1.2316 ± 853 ± 433.1 ± 1.14.0 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab All mutants show reduced disproportionating activities with the maltoheptaose EPS (Table III), most prominently for G179L, G180L, and G179L/G180L. With the shorter G5-pNP substrate, which cannot reach subsite −6, the mutants G179L, G179L/G180L, and N193G had decreased disproportionation activity, whereas the Y167F, G180L, and N193L mutants had wild-type activity (Table IV). Furthermore, the wild-type CGTase had a lower disproportionation activity with the shorter G5-pNP substrate than with EPS, indicating that substrate interactions at subsite −6 are important in this reaction. Mutation of Gly-179 and Gly-180 resulted in 4- to 5-fold increasedKm,EPS values (Table III), demonstrating that introducing leucines at positions 179 and 180 negatively affects binding of the maltoheptaose compound EPS. This indicates that the wild-type enzyme has interactions with EPS at subsite −6. Indeed, product analysis of the disproportionation reaction showed that EPS is able to reach subsite −6 (data not shown). Mutation of Tyr-167 and Asn-193, in contrast, has no significant effect on theKm,EPS value (Table III). The specificity constants (kcat/Km,EPS) (Table III) also show that Gly-179 and Gly-180 are especially important for the disproportionation activity of CGTase. The apparent affinities for the acceptor substrate (Km,maltose) are not significantly changed, except for the double mutant G179L/G180L, which has a 2-fold lower Km,maltose value (Table III).Table IIIKinetic parameters of the disproportionating reaction with EPS catalyzed by wild-type and mutant cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases from B. circulans strain 251KM,EPSKM,maltosekcat,disp.3-adisp., disproportionation; cycl., cyclization.kcat/KM,EPSkcat,β-cycl./kcat,disp.mms−1s−1mm−1Wild-type0.22 ± 0.020.83 ± 0.051213 ± 225514 ± 5110.28G179L1.06 ± 0.050.80 ± 0.04597 ± 15563 ± 300.45G180L0.92 ± 0.080.87 ± 0.09493 ± 21539 ± 520.16G179L/G180L1.04 ± 0.060.35 ± 0.02317 ± 8305 ± 190.26Y167F0.21 ± 0.030.91 ± 0.10990 ± 234714 ± 6820.28N193G0.20 ± 0.021.04 ± 0.08774 ± 223870 ± 4020.21N193L0.21 ± 0.020.86 ± 0.071076 ± 355124 ± 5160.293-a disp., disproportionation; cycl., cyclization.

The G179L mutant has a 4-fold decreased kcat value for β-cyclodextrin coupling. Unexpectedly, the coupling activities with α- and γ-cyclodextrin are fully abolished (Table V). Furthermore, the coupling activities of the G179L/G180L mutant are also virtually absent for each of the three cyclodextrins (Table V). In contrast, the Y167F, G180L, N193G, and N193L mutants retained significant coupling activity with all cyclodextrins tested (data not shown for α- and γ-cyclodextrin). The G180L and N193G mutants strongly reduced the coupling activity with β-cyclodextrin, whereas the effect was small for Y167F and N193L. Thus, subsite −6 is very important in the coupling reactions. The mutations at subsite −6 also have an effect on acceptor binding as shown by the apparent affinity constants for the acceptor substrate (Table V).

https://openalex.org/W1969345387,"SNURF is a small RING finger protein that binds the zinc finger region of steroid hormone receptors and enhances Sp1- and androgen receptor-mediated transcription in COS and CV-1 cells. In this study, we show that SNURF coactivates both wild-type estrogen receptor α (ERα) (4-fold)- and HE19 (ERα deletion of activation function 1 (AF1)) (210-fold)-mediated activation of an estrogen-responsive element promoter in ZR-75 cells. In mammalian two-hybrid assays in ZR-75 cells SNURF interactions were estrogen (E2)-dependent and were not observed with the antiestrogen ICI 182,780. ERα interacted with multiple regions of SNURF; SNURF interactions with ERα were dependent on AF2, and D538N, E542Q, and D545N mutations in helix 12 abrogated both SNURF-ERα binding and coactivation. Moreover, peptide fusion proteins that inhibit interactions between helix 12 of ERα with LXXLL box-containing proteins also blocked ERα coactivation by SNURF. However, cotransfection of SNURF with prototypical steroid receptor coactivators 1, 2, and 3 that contain LXXLL box motifs did not enhance E2 responsiveness, whereas TATA-binding protein (TBP) and SNURF cooperatively coactivated ERα-mediated transactivation. The results are consistent with a unique model for cooperative coactivation of ERα that requires ligand binding, repositioning of helix 12, recruitment of TBP, and interaction with SNURF, which binds both ERα and TBP.

For example, the two forms of the estrogen receptor (ERα and ERβ) contain a highly conserved DNA binding domain C (DBD) (97% homology for human ERs) in the central portion of both proteins (20Mosselman S.

Similarities between the DBDs of NRs are due to their zinc finger motifs, which directly bind DNA; however, despite these similarities, subtle structural differences are important for sequence-specific interactions of these transcription factors (2Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). The N-terminal and C-terminal domains (A/B and E/F for the ER) of NRs contain activation function 1 (AF1) and AF2, respectively, and the ligand binding domain is also located in AF2. The expression and functions of AF1/AF2 are highly variable among NRs; however, for some NRs, such as the androgen receptor (AR), both domains interact to enhance transcriptional activation. Several different classes of proteins interact with NRs to enhance or inhibit their activity as trans-acting factors, and these interacting proteins include coactivators, cointegrators, corepressors, and multiple proteins associated with the basal transcription machinery (reviewed in Refs. 24Horwitz K.B.

SRCs and other coactivators were initially isolated using two-hybrid assays with AF2 domains as bait, and there is also evidence that for some hormone receptors, coactivators also interact with AF1 to enhance transactivation (36Norris J.D.

SNURF also enhances basal transcription from various hormone-responsive promoters and from promoters containing GC-rich sites that bind the Sp1 transcription factor (55Poukka H. Aarnisalo P.

This study investigates physical and functional interactions of SNURF with human ERα (hERα) in ZR-75 breast cancer cells, and the results show that SNURF coactivates hERα-dependent transcription in ZR-75 cells transfected with a construct (pERE3) containing three tandem estrogen-responsive elements (EREs) linked to a luciferase reporter gene. Although SNURF does not directly interact with the AF2 domain of hERα, SNURF coactivation of ERα is cooperative and requires ligand-dependent repositioning of helix 12 and recruitment of TATA-binding protein (TBP). Fetal bovine serum was obtained from Summit Biotechnology (Fort Collins, CO). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Poly[d(I-C)] and restriction enzymes (HindIII, SalI, BamHI) were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Reagents for β-galactosidase analysis were purchased from Tropix (Bedford, MA). Human ERα expression plasmid was originally supplied by Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) and recloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The pERE3 reporter containing three consensus ERE sites linked to a luciferase gene was created by cloning an oligonucleotide with three ERE elements intoBamHI-HindIII cut pXP-2 plasmid (American Type Culture collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA). Plasmid preparation kits were purchased from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, CA); 40% polyacrylamide was obtained from National Diagnostics (Atlanta, GA). ICI 182,780 was provided by Dr. Alan Wakeling (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, UK). Expression plasmids for ERα mutants with deletions of amino acid 1–178 (HE19) or 185–252 (HE11) were kindly provided by Dr. Pierre Chambon, and TBP expression plasmid was obtained from Dr. Laszlo Tora (Institute de Genetique et Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France). ERα-null and ERα-AF1 were derived from HE19, and ERα containing D538N, E542Q, and D545N mutations and were kindly provided by Dr. Donald McDonnell (Duke University, Durham, NC). cDNAs for these constructs were then subcloned into theEcoRI site of pcDNA3.1.

Expression plasmids for SRC-1, GRIP-1 (SRC-2), and SRC-3 (AIB1) were provided by Dr. Bert O'Malley (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), Dr. Michael Stallcup (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA), and Dr. Paul Meltzer (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), respectively. The expression plasmid for the GRIP-1 NR-box polypeptide GAL4 fusion protein was provided by Dr. Donald McDonnell (Duke University, Durham, NC). All other chemicals and biochemicals were the highest duality available from commercial sources. ZR-75 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC and grown and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded onto 12-well plates at a concentration of 2.75 × 105cells/well in phenol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. After 18 h, cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 1 μg of pERE3 reporter plasmid, 0.25 μg of a CMV β-gal expression plasmid, the appropriate hERα expression plasmid, and the appropriate SNURF expression construct. After 6–8 h, cells were shocked with 25% glycerol for 20 s, rinsed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and dosed with either Me2SO or 10 nm E2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 plus 2.5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum for 36 h. Cells were harvested by scraping the plates in 100 μl of 1× lysis buffer. Twenty μl of the cell lysate was used for performing luciferase assays on a Lumicount Luminometer (Packard Instrument Co.). Twenty μl of the cell lysate was used for running a β-gal analysis on a luminometer. Normalized luciferase values were calculated by dividing the luciferase value by the β-gal value for a given sample. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. and compared with the Me2SO control group (arbitrarily set at 1) for each set of experiments. For Western analysis, ZR-75 cells were seeded and transfected as described above and harvested in 100 μl of 1× lysis buffer. After luciferase and β-gal assays were performed, 10 μl of 3 m NaCl was added to the remaining 60 μl of extract to obtain maximal protein yield. The lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h with intermittent vortexing followed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Equal amounts of protein from each treatment group were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (transfer buffer: 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.025% SDS). Membranes were blocked for 30 min in Blotto (5% milk + TBS (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0,150 mm NaCl), 0.05% Tween 20), probed with polyclonal antibodies for ERα (sc-544 purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:1000 in Blotto for 5 h, washed 2 × 5 min in TBS + 0.05% Tween 20, and probed with secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:5000 in Blotto) for 2 h. The membranes were then washed 3 × 5 min in TBS + 0.05% Tween 20, 1 × 5 min in TBS, and visualized using the ECL detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantitation of the Western blot was performed using a Sharp JX-330 scanner (Sharp Corp., Mahwah, NJ) and Zero-D Scanalytics software (Scanalytics Corp., Billerica, MA). Plasmid pERE3 was created by cloning three consensus ERE elements (GGTCANNNTGACC, N is a nucleoside) separated by 10 base pairs into pXP-2, 30 base pairs upstream of the TATA box. ERα-GAL4 fusion proteins were constructed as follows. First, the GAL4DBD fusion expression vector pM (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was digested withBamHI and HindIII, and the oligo sequence GATCCGTGTCTGCAGACGTCGACA was inserted into this digested vector. This oligo was added to create more space between restriction enzymesBamHI and SalI in the polylinker of vector pM, providing a more efficient digestion of these two enzymes when cut simultaneously. This new vector, pM(+10), was then used for construction of each of the pM-ER plasmids.

All pM-ERα constructs were sequenced to confirm that no unintended mutations were incorporated from Taq polymerase. SNURF-VP16 constructs were made as indicated; initially pVP16 (CLONTECH) was digested with BamHI andHindIII followed by PCR amplification of SNURF cDNA from each of the mutant or deletion SNURF expression plasmids.

Protein-protein interactions between ER and SNURF were examined in ZR-75 cells using the mammalian MATCHMAKER two-hybrid kit (CLONTECH). For determination of regions on SNURF that are important for physically interacting with ERα, ZR-75 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 1 μg of 5×GAL-luciferase, 500 ng of pM-ERα, and either 250 ng pVP-16-wt-SNURF or 250 ng each of the pVP-SNURF mutants or deletions. Six to 8 h after transfection, cells were shocked with 25% glycerol for 20 s, washed 1× with phosphate-buffered saline, and then dosed with either 10 nmE2 or vehicle alone (Me2SO). For determination of the regions on ERα that are necessary for interacting with SNURF, ZR-75 cells were transfected with 1 μg of 5×GAL-luciferase, 500 ng of pM-wt ER, or 500 ng of pM-mutated or deleted ER and 250 ng of pVP-16-wtSNURF. Breast cancer cells were grown in 60-mm tissue culture plates to 80–95% confluency, transfected pERE3, glycerol-shocked, and grown in serum-free medium for 3 days. Cells were then treated with E2 for various times, and formaldehyde was then added to the medium to give a 1% solution. After mixing on a rotary shaker for 10 min at 20 °C, glycine was then added (final concentration of 0.125 m); after further incubation for 10 min, the medium was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), scraped, and collected by centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended in swell buffer (85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and aprotinin at pH 8.0) and homogenized, and nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 30 s. Nuclei were then resuspended in sonication buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris at pH 8.1) and sonicated for 45–60 s to obtain chromatin with appropriate fragment lengths of 500-1000 base pairs. The sonicated extract was then centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 10 min at 0 °C, separated into aliquots, and stored at −70 °C until used. The cross-linked chromatin preparations were diluted in buffer (1% Triton X, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 10 mm Tris/1 mM EDTA at pH 8.1), and 20 μl of Ultralink protein A or G or A/G beads (Pierce) was added per 100 μl of chromatin and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. A 200-μl aliquot was saved and used as the 100% input control. This aliquot was treated at 65 °C to reverse cross-links, and DNA was purified as described below. The cross-linked mixtures were then centrifuged to remove the beads; salmon sperm DNA, specific ERα antibodies, and 20 μl of Ultralink beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged; beads were resuspended in dialysis buffer, vortexed for 5 min at 20 °C, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 s; beads were then resuspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (11 mm Tris, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid at pH 8.0) and vortexed for 5 min at 20 °C. The procedures with the dialysis and immunoprecipitation buffers were repeated (3–4×), and beads were then resuspended in elution buffer (50 nm sodium bicarbonate, 1% SDS, 1.5 μg/m sonicated salmon sperm DNA), vortexed, and incubated at 65 °C for 15 min. Supernatants were then isolated by centrifugation and incubated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse protein-DNA cross-links. Wizard PCR kits were used for additional DNA cleanup, and PCR was used to detect the presence of promoter regions immunoprecipitated with the different ERα antibodies. SNURF antibodies were previously described (54Moilanen A.M. Poukka H. Karvonen U. Hakli Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Mol. Cell.

The following primers were used for PCR analysis of the transfected pERE3construct and the E2-responsive −294 to −511 region of the cathepsin D gene promoter: cathepsin D forward (−294), 5′-TCC AGA CAT CCT CTC TGG AA-3′, and reverse (−54), 5′-GGA GCG GAG GGT CCA TTC-3′; cathepsin D forward control (+2469), 5′-TGC ACA AGT TCA CGT CCA TC-3′, and reverse (+2615), 5′-TGT AGT TCT TGA GCA CCT CG-3′; pERE3 forward (6128), 5′-GTT TGT CCA AAC TCA TCA ATG-3′, and reverse (105), 5′-CTT TAT GTT TTT GGC GTC TTC-3′. As a negative control, immunoprecipitation of the +2469 to +2615 region of the cathepsin D gene promoter was also determined and confirmed by both PCR and PCR combined with Southern analysis using a specific probe for this region of cathepsin D. Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and Scheffe's test, and the levels of probability are noted. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. for at least three separate (replicate experiments for each treatment group. ZR-75 breast cancer cells are E2-responsive and primarily express ERα. E2 did not significantly induce reporter gene activity in this cell line after transfection with pERE3; however, after cotransfection with 7.5 ng of ERα expression plasmid, a 5-fold induction of luciferase activity was observed (Fig.1A). Similar results have previously been observed in ER-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells where cotransfection of ERα is required for induction of reporter gene activity by E2 using constructs containing EREs, AP-1 promoters, or E2-responsive regions from the pS2, cathepsin D, c-fos, and PR gene promoters (56–68). Cotransfection of ERα is also required for E2-induced transactivation using constructs containing several E2-responsive GC-rich gene promoter inserts that interact with ERα/Sp1, and this is due to overexpression of the transfected reporter plasmids (69Porter W.

https://openalex.org/W2096948896,"We have previously reported that cofilin, an actin-binding protein, plays an important role in phagocyte functions, such as respiratory burst, phagocytosis, and chemotaxis. On the other hand, it was recently found that LIM motif-containing kinase (LIMK) phosphorylates cofilin. In this work, we investigated the roles of LIMK in activated phagocytes. The results of immunostaining showed that in dormant phagocytes the endogenous LIMK1 was diffusely distributed in the cytosol of macrophage-like U937 cells, and when activated by opsonized zymosan (OZ), it was translocated to plasma membranes. Green fluorescence protein (GFP)-conjugated LIMK was expressed in the phagocytes, and the GFP-positive cells were isolated by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The isolated wild-type LIMK-overexpressing cells produced superoxide at a rate that was 3.2-fold higher than that of only GFP-expressing control cells, whereas the respiratory burst of dominant negative LIMK1(D460A)-expressing cells decreased to 31% of that of the control cells. Phagocytic activity monitored by using Texas Red-labeled OZ was also decreased in the D460A-expressing cells. By immunoblotting using a specific anti-phosphorylated cofilin antibody, it was revealed that in the OZ-activated wild-type LIMK1-GFP-expressing cells, the phosphorylated cofilin increased by 2.3-fold, and that in the OZ-activated D460A-GFP-expressing cells, the phosphorylated cofilin decreased to 47% of that of only GFP-expressing cells (mock control). Furthermore, in the wild-type LIMK1-expressing cells, OZ-evoked increase in filamentous actin was markedly enhanced, whereas in the dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells, the total level of F-actin was strongly suppressed. These results suggest that LIMK1 regulates the functions of phagocytes through phosphorylation of cofilin and enhances the formation of filamentous actin.

The activation mechanisms have been studied in terms of protein phosphorylation and cytoskeletal reorganization (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we found that cofilin, an actin/phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-binding protein, is rapidly dephosphorylated in the phagocytes upon activation and translocated to plasma membranes (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19551-19556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These findings were confirmed by other groups (3Okada K. Takano-Ohmuro H. Obinata T. Abe H. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Djafarzadeh S. Niggli V. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 427-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 5Heyworth P.G.

It has been generally thought that among many actin-binding proteins, cofilin plays an essential role in control of the reorganization of actin in various types of cells (6Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Only the unphosphorylated form of cofilin can bind actin and depolymerize the actin filament, and it was recently proposed that cofilin is involved in the turnover of actin filament. In the phagocytes, cofilin seemed to be involved in many important functions, including superoxide production (7Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Oshizawa T. Yamamoto Y. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Kawanishi T. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Hayakawa T. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), phagocytosis (9Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and chemotaxis (10Adachi R. Matsui S. Kinoshita M. Nagaishi K. Sasaki H. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 2000; 22: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, we also reported that opsonized zymosan (OZ),1 a complement C3bi-coated insoluble polysaccharide, binds to its specific receptor of the β2 integrin family (CR3, CD11b/CD18) to trigger the dephosphorylation of cofilin, and it occurs downstream of a tyrosine kinase and a phospholipase C (9Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Matsui S. Adachi R. Kusui K. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Hayakawa T. Suzuki K. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, in the phagocytes, the regulatory mechanisms of the phosphorylation of cofilin remain unclear. On the other hand, we and another group elucidated that LIM kinases phosphorylate cofilin (12Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 13Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigated the roles of LIMK in the phagocytes. We found that OZ activation evoked changes in the intracellular distribution of endogenous LIMK1 and that expression of the protein kinase or its kinase-dead mutant modulate the functions of phagocytes. This is the first paper describing the roles of LIMK in immunological phagocytes.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we first examined the roles of LIMK1 in the phagocytes in the immune system and concluded that LIMK1 is deeply involved in their OZ-triggered functions based on the following observations. 1) Upon activation, the endogenous LIMK1 translocated from cytosol to the plasma membrane region where phagocytosis and superoxide production occurred. 2) Wild-type LIMK1-overexpressing cells showed increased O2−˙-production, whereas in the dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells, the respiratory burst was suppressed. 3) The phagocytic activity of the dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells was much lower than that of the control cells. These phenomena seem to be mediated mainly by a change in the phosphorylated state of cofilin, because cofilin is the substrate of LIMK1 and because the result of immunoblotting indicated that cofilin was highly phosphorylated in the wild-type LIMK1-expressing cells and much less phoshorylated in dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells.In general, it is known that stimulation triggers an increase in F-actin in phagocytes including neutrophils (16Downey G.P. Chan C.K. Lea P. Takai A. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and macrophages (9Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,17Greenberg S. el Khoury J. di Virgilio F. Kaplan E.M. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The data of fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry clearly show that the OZ-evoked increase in F-actin was remarkably enhanced in wild-type LIMK1-expressing cells, whereas it was suppressed in the dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells. It is possible to consider that in the wild-type LIMK1-expressing cells F-actin depolymerizing activity of cofilin was inhibited by phosphorylation, leading to the enhancement of the OZ-triggered formation of F-actin, and in the dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells, the increased amount of unphosphorylated cofilin sequestered monomeric actin and severed F-actin (6Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), resulting in the inhibition of the formation of F-actin.It has been elucidated that the superoxide-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase is integrated into the plasma membranes of phagocytes and is activated by assembly with cytosolic factors p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and rac (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation mechanisms of these factors have not been determined, whereas it has been reported that some of those factors interact with actin cytoskeleton (18Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3071-3081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that the activated oxidase is associated with Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton (21Woodman R.C. Ruedi J.M. Jesaitis A.J. Okamura N. Quinn M.T. Smith R.M. Curnutte J.T. Babior B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is probable that the actin-cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in the translocation of the cytosolic factors and supports the activation of oxidase (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).By using neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, we originally identified cofilin as a phosphoprotein, which was rapidly dephosphorylated upon activation (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol.

However, the results of this study apparently contradict previous observations, because the LIMK1-dependent phosphorylation of cofilin seems to be an enhancing signal for the OZ activation of the macrophage-like cells.

Signal. 2001; 13: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the following considerations are possible. At a very early stage of activation, the preexisting intracellular actin network, which supports the dormant stage of the phagocytes, should decay once, and dephosphorylated cofilin is required for the depolymerization of the preexisting filamentous actin. At the next stage, the monomeric actin must be reorganized to form new actin filaments, which are necessary to express the various functions, namely phagocytosis, respiratory burst, migration, and degranulation. Newly reconstructed F-actin may support these functions, and an excess amount of unphosphorylated cofilin seems to impair the reorganization of actin, leading to suppression of the phagocyte functions.It has been reported that in other cells both p21(rac)-activated kinase (22Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) and Rho-activated kinase (23Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) phosphorylate the threonine of the activation loop of LIMK to phosphorylate cofilin. Rac may participate not only in the respiratory burst as mentioned above but also in the phosphorylation of cofilin. At present, cofilin is the only known substrate of LIMK1, however, there may be other substrates that could affect the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. Further studies should be performed to resolve the signaling pathway in detail. Phagocytes including neutrophils and macrophages rest without any stimuli, however, when activated by bacteria or other various harmful substances, they play a crucial role in host defense through various functions, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and superoxide production.

It has been generally thought that among many actin-binding proteins, cofilin plays an essential role in control of the reorganization of actin in various types of cells (6Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Only the unphosphorylated form of cofilin can bind actin and depolymerize the actin filament, and it was recently proposed that cofilin is involved in the turnover of actin filament. In the phagocytes, cofilin seemed to be involved in many important functions, including superoxide production (7Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Oshizawa T. Yamamoto Y. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1266: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 8Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Kawanishi T. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Hayakawa T. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), phagocytosis (9Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and chemotaxis (10Adachi R. Matsui S. Kinoshita M. Nagaishi K. Sasaki H. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 2000; 22: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, we also reported that opsonized zymosan (OZ),1 a complement C3bi-coated insoluble polysaccharide, binds to its specific receptor of the β2 integrin family (CR3, CD11b/CD18) to trigger the dephosphorylation of cofilin, and it occurs downstream of a tyrosine kinase and a phospholipase C (9Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Matsui S. Adachi R. Kusui K. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Hayakawa T. Suzuki K. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, in the phagocytes, the regulatory mechanisms of the phosphorylation of cofilin remain unclear. On the other hand, we and another group elucidated that LIM kinases phosphorylate cofilin (12Arber S. Barbayannis F.A. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C.A. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, 13Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigated the roles of LIMK in the phagocytes. We found that OZ activation evoked changes in the intracellular distribution of endogenous LIMK1 and that expression of the protein kinase or its kinase-dead mutant modulate the functions of phagocytes. This is the first paper describing the roles of LIMK in immunological phagocytes. DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we first examined the roles of LIMK1 in the phagocytes in the immune system and concluded that LIMK1 is deeply involved in their OZ-triggered functions based on the following observations. 1) Upon activation, the endogenous LIMK1 translocated from cytosol to the plasma membrane region where phagocytosis and superoxide production occurred. 2) Wild-type LIMK1-overexpressing cells showed increased O2−˙-production, whereas in the dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells, the respiratory burst was suppressed. 3) The phagocytic activity of the dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells was much lower than that of the control cells. These phenomena seem to be mediated mainly by a change in the phosphorylated state of cofilin, because cofilin is the substrate of LIMK1 and because the result of immunoblotting indicated that cofilin was highly phosphorylated in the wild-type LIMK1-expressing cells and much less phoshorylated in dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells.In general, it is known that stimulation triggers an increase in F-actin in phagocytes including neutrophils (16Downey G.P. Chan C.K. Lea P. Takai A. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 695-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and macrophages (9Nagaishi K. Adachi R. Matsui S. Yamaguchi T. Kasahara T. Suzuki K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 180: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,17Greenberg S. el Khoury J. di Virgilio F. Kaplan E.M. Silverstein S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 757-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The data of fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry clearly show that the OZ-evoked increase in F-actin was remarkably enhanced in wild-type LIMK1-expressing cells, whereas it was suppressed in the dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells. It is possible to consider that in the wild-type LIMK1-expressing cells F-actin depolymerizing activity of cofilin was inhibited by phosphorylation, leading to the enhancement of the OZ-triggered formation of F-actin, and in the dominant negative LIMK1-expressing cells, the increased amount of unphosphorylated cofilin sequestered monomeric actin and severed F-actin (6Bamburg J.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 185-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), resulting in the inhibition of the formation of F-actin.It has been elucidated that the superoxide-generating enzyme NADPH oxidase is integrated into the plasma membranes of phagocytes and is activated by assembly with cytosolic factors p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and rac (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translocation mechanisms of these factors have not been determined, whereas it has been reported that some of those factors interact with actin cytoskeleton (18Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D.

Okamura N. Quinn M.T. Smith R.M. Curnutte J.T. Babior B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is probable that the actin-cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in the translocation of the cytosolic factors and supports the activation of oxidase (1Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).By using neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, we originally identified cofilin as a phosphoprotein, which was rapidly dephosphorylated upon activation (2Suzuki K. Yamaguchi T. Tanaka T. Kawanishi T. Nishimaki-Mogami T. Yamamoto K. Tsuji T. Irimura T. Hayakawa T. Takahashi A. J. Biol.

Signal. 2001; 13: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), the following considerations are possible. At a very early stage of activation, the preexisting intracellular actin network, which supports the dormant stage of the phagocytes, should decay once, and dephosphorylated cofilin is required for the depolymerization of the preexisting filamentous actin. At the next stage, the monomeric actin must be reorganized to form new actin filaments, which are necessary to express the various functions, namely phagocytosis, respiratory burst, migration, and degranulation. Newly reconstructed F-actin may support these functions, and an excess amount of unphosphorylated cofilin seems to impair the reorganization of actin, leading to suppression of the phagocyte functions.It has been reported that in other cells both p21(rac)-activated kinase (22Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar) and Rho-activated kinase (23Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A.

Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar) phosphorylate the threonine of the activation loop of LIMK to phosphorylate cofilin. Rac may participate not only in the respiratory burst as mentioned above but also in the phosphorylation of cofilin. At present, cofilin is the only known substrate of LIMK1, however, there may be other substrates that could affect the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. Further studies should be performed to resolve the signaling pathway in detail.

Previous work demonstrated that members of the nuclear factor 1 (NF1) family of transcription factors and an unidentified factor bind to and mediate repression from this regulatory element. By using a yeast one-hybrid screen, Olf-1/Early B cell factor (O/E-1) was isolated as a candidate for this unidentified factor. A protein complex from 3T3-L1 adipocyte nuclear extract that bound the negative regulatory element was recognized by O/E-specific antiserum, and binding activity was competed effectively by distinct O/E-binding sequences. O/E binding activity was also detected in nuclear extracts from insulin-responsive, GLUT4-expressing tissues including adipose, skeletal muscle, and heart. Mutations within the negative regulatory element that abolish binding of O/E proteins concomitantly blocked insulin-induced repression in reporter gene assays. These results suggest that one or more members of the O/E transcription factor family function as important regulators ofglut4 gene expression and therefore may play a heretofore unanticipated role in glucose homeostasis and insulin signaling.

Pessin J.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1996; 16: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). One member of the GLUT family, GLUT4, mediates insulin-stimulated glucose uptake primarily in muscle and adipose tissue (2Kahn B.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 593-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Insulin triggers glucose uptake by promoting rapid translocation of GLUT4 from intracellular storage sites to the plasma membrane (3Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Circulating glucose then enters the cell and is subsequently metabolized. Although skeletal muscle appears to be the primary depository for whole body glucose disposal, adipose tissue functions as an additional storage site and plays a critical role in maintaining both insulin responsiveness and glucose homeostasis. Recent studies in mice demonstrate that adipose-selective diminution of GLUT4 leads to decreased glucose tolerance and to impaired in vivoinsulin responsiveness in adipose tissue, muscle, and liver (4Abel E.D. Peroni O. Kim J.K. Kim Y.-B. Boss O. Hadro E. Minnemann T. Shulman G.I. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Conversely, transgenic mice overexpressing GLUT4 in adipose tissue exhibit enhanced glucose clearance and insulin sensitivity (5Shepherd P.R. Gnudi L. Tozzo E. Yang H. Leach F. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22243-22246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, GLUT4 expression is decreased in adipose tissue of humans suffering from obesity or type 2 diabetes (6Garvey W.T. Maianu L. Huecksteadt T.P. Birnbaum M.J. Molina J.M. Ciaraldi T.P. J.

Decreased insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose homeostasis characterize these metabolic disturbances. Thus, the expression level of GLUT4 in adipose tissue is positively correlated with insulin sensitivity and whole body glucose disposal. The 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line (8Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (741) Google Scholar) has been used extensively as anin vitro model for studying adipogenesis and adipocyte biology (9MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Adipocytes derived from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes faithfully recapitulate many of the molecular, metabolic, and morphological characteristics of tissue adipocytes. 3T3-L1 adipocytes express GLUT4, and insulin acutely stimulates GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake in these cells (10Flores-Riveros J.R.

However, chronic insulin treatment decreases GLUT4 mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (10Flores-Riveros J.R. McLenithan J.C. Ezaki O. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) a response element from the 5′-flanking region of the glut4 gene promoter that mediates insulin- and cAMP-induced repression of glut4 gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Nuclear factor 1 (NF1) was identified as one of the trans-acting factors that mediates repression from this element (13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A second non-NF1 trans-acting factor was also identified during our studies (12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this article, we present evidence to support the identification of Olf-1/early B cell factor (O/E) as the second trans-acting factor that regulates GLUT4 expression from this response element. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (8Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (741) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% calf serum (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY). Differentiation was induced as described (14Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by incubating 2-day postconfluent cells (designated day 0) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and a hormonal mixture composed of 520 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 167 nm insulin for 48 h. Cells were then incubated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 167 nm insulin for another 48 h, after which they were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum with a media change every 48 h. All cell culture medium was supplemented throughout with 62.5 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 8 μg/ml biotin. The plasmid ΔL1 (15Marcus S.L. Miyata K.S. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Gene Expr. 1995; 4: 227-239PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kassam A. Hunter J. Rachubinski R.A. Capone J.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 141: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) containing a yeastGAL1 minimal promoter upstream of a lacZreporter gene and a URA3 selectable marker was kindly provided by A. Kassam and R. Rachubinski (University of Alberta). The 2μ origin was removed from ΔL1 by digestion with SpeI followed by religation. ΔL1 lacking the 2μ origin was then digested with Ecl136II, which cuts in the middle of thelacZ gene, and a PCR-amplified yeast imidazole glycerol-phosphate dehydratase gene (HIS3) was ligated into the Ecl136II site in frame with the lacZ gene thereby generating ΔL1/HIS3. ΔL1/HIS3 encodes a LacZ-HIS3 fusion protein that retains HIS3 activity but does not retain β-galactosidase activity. Complementary M2 oligonucleotides (see Fig.1A for sequence of top strand) withXhoI-compatible overhangs were annealed, and three copies of the annealed duplex DNA were inserted into the XhoI site of ΔL1/HIS3 upstream of the GAL1 minimal promoter. The resultant reporter plasmid, 3XM2ΔL1/HIS3, was linearized withApaI and transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YCB436 (MATa, ade2Δ::hisG, his3Δ200, leu2Δ1, lys2Δ202, trp1Δ63, ura3-52, Ref. 17Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar). Stable genomic integrants were selected on synthetic medium lacking uracil and verified by Southern blotting thus generating the yeast reporter strainYCB436::3XM2ΔL1/HIS3. The adipocyte library was constructed using a commercially available kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (HybriZAP 2.1 XR, Stratagene). Briefly, DNase-treated poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes at day 8 of the differentiation protocol was used as starting material for library construction. Both random primed cDNA and oligo(dT) primed cDNA were generated, ligated into a predigested λ vector (HybriZAP-2.1), packaged, and subsequently excised to yield a LEU2-selectable plasmid library of 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNAs fused to a sequence encoding the activation domain of GAL4 (backbone vector, pAD-GAL4–2.1). The plasmid library was transformed into S. cerevisiae strain BY4734 (MATα, his3Δ200, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, trp1Δ63, ura3Δ0, Ref. 17Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar), and transformants were selected on synthetic medium lacking leucine. A large number of transformants were scraped from plates, pooled, resuspended in liquid medium containing 10% Me2SO (v/v), and frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. The yeast one-hybrid screen was initiated by growing a 100-ml culture of the yeast reporter strainYCB436::3XM2ΔL1/HIS3 (see above) at 30 °C to an A600 >0.8. An aliquot of the frozen yeast strain BY4734 containing the adipocyte library (see above) was thawed and mated withYCB436::3XM2ΔL1/HIS3 in a 50-ml volume of 2× YPDA + 50 μg/ml kanamycin for 20 h at 30 °C with gentle shaking (50 rpm). The resulting diploid cells were then plated on 50 100-mm culture plates containing synthetic medium lacking uracil (to select for the reporter strain), leucine (to select for the library plasmid), and histidine (to select for HIS3 reporter activity). Library plasmids were recovered from colonies that grew on the screening plates, shuttled into Escherichia coli, and sequenced. The wild type GLUT4 reporter (–785GLUT4/CAT) contains the 785 bases of 5′-flanking sequence of the murine glut4 gene, the GLUT4 transcription initiation site, 171 bp of GLUT4 5′-untranslated sequence, and the coding sequence for the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Reporter genes M3 and M4 contained the indicated mutations (see Fig.1A) in the context of −785GLUT4/CAT (13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Stable 3T3-L1 cell lines expressing promoter-reporter gene constructs were prepared as described (12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J.

Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). For each construct, two or more independent pools of 20–50 foci were analyzed. Cells were propagated as preadipocytes and induced to differentiate into adipocytes as described (12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On day 9 after induction the fully differentiated adipocytes were treated with 1 μm insulin (Roche Molecular Biochemical) as indicated. Total RNA and nuclear extracts were purified as described (12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Cooke D.W.

Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The level of expression of endogenous glut4 mRNA was quantitated by Northern analysis using a 1.7-kb murine glut4cDNA probe (12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Reporter gene mRNA levels were quantitated using a competitive reverse transcriptase-PCR assay as described previously (12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 30 μg of nuclear extract was boiled in an SDS sample loading buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) for 10 min. The samples were loaded on a 10% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and processed as described previously (13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes all known O/E family members (19Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The O/E-1 positive control was generated by transiently transfecting one 60-mm dish of preconfluent 293T cells with 1 μg of cytomegalovirus promoter-driven O/E-1 expression plasmid (pCIS-O/E-1(8), Refs. 19Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar and 20Wang S.S. Tsai R.Y. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (21Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). Mock-transfected cells were treated in an identical manner but did not receive any expression plasmid. 24 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in an SDS-containing buffer (1% SDS, 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and boiled, and 0.5 μg of protein from the cell lysates were loaded onto the gel. S. Wang and R. Reed (The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) generously provided the O/E antibody and pCIS-O/E-1 expression plasmid. DNA binding assays were conducted as described previously (12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 1a binding activity was purified from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes using an affinity chromatography technique as described previously (22Jiang M.S. Tang Q.Q. McLenithan J. Geiman D. Shillinglaw W. Henzel W.J. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3467-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, an oligonucleotide affinity column was prepared by linking concatenated M2 oligonucleotide to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). 30 mg of nuclear extract from 3T3-L1 adipocytes was bound to DNA-cellulose in buffer containing 100 mm KCl and then eluted as a single peak at 280 mm KCl by gradient elution. Fractions containing 1a binding activity were identified by gel mobility shift assay using the M2 oligonucleotide as the probe, desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), and then bound to the oligonucleotide affinity column in the presence of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and 150 mm KCl. 1a binding activity was eluted as a single peak at 280 mmKCl and was purified over 200-fold that of crude nuclear extract. Previously, we isolated a regulatory element from the glut4 promoter that mediates chronic insulin- and cAMP-induced repression ofglut4 gene expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 18Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We also identified two distinct factors from adipocyte nuclear extract that bind to and mediate repression from this negative regulatory element (13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). One of these factors is represented by one or more members of the NF1 family of DNA-binding proteins (13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A yeast one-hybrid screen was undertaken to identify the second unknown factor referred to as 1a. Three copies of duplex DNA containing the sequence of the M2 oligonucleotide were linked to a minimal yeast promoter and placed upstream of a HIS3 gene to generate a reporter plasmid (Fig.1, A and B, also see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Preliminary DNA binding assays indicated that the unknown factor bound the M2 oligonucleotide strongly (Fig. 2 and Refs. 12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, and18Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In contrast, NF1 family members and other 3T3-L1 adipocyte nuclear proteins did not bind the M2 oligonucleotide (12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid was integrated into the genome of an S. cerevisiaestrain, and a plasmid library of 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNAs fused to a sequence encoding a GAL4 activation domain was screened. cDNAs that encode a protein that binds the M2 oligonucleotide are presumed to tether the activation domain of GAL4 to the reporter gene promoter thereby activating HIS3 gene expression and enabling the yeast to grow in the absence of histidine (Fig. 1B). Seven reproducible clones emerged from this screen. The GAL4 activation domain alone did not activate reporter gene expression as expected (Fig. 1C). All seven clones exhibited specific activation of the M2-containing reporter plasmid and did not activate the parental reporter plasmid or a reporter plasmid containing an unrelated oligonucleotide in place of M2 (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Sequence analysis revealed that all seven clones encoded the same previously identified protein termed Olf-1/Early B cell factor (O/E-1, Refs. 19Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 20Wang S.S. Tsai R.Y. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4149-4158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and 23Hagman J. Belanger C. Travis A. Turck C.W. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 760-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Two clones contained cDNAs encoding the entire O/E-1 protein, and the remaining five clones encoded slightly truncated proteins beginning at Ser11 of the O/E-1 amino acid sequence. DNA binding assays were conducted to support the identification of O/E-1 as the unknown adipocyte protein. A radioactively labeled oligonucleotide containing the murine GLUT4 negative regulatory element was used as a probe (see Fig. 1A for sequence). Nuclear extract was prepared from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and the extract was incubated with the probe, and protein-DNA complexes were resolved by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. As described in our previous studies (12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), three major complexes formed (Fig. 2, lane 1, also see Fig.6). Proteins contained within complexes 1b and 2 have been identified as NF1 family members (13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consistent with those findings, an unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide containing a consensus NF1-binding site (oligonucleotide N) prevented visualization of the two faster migrating NF1-containing complexes leaving only the 1a complex (Fig. 2,lane 3). Upon incubation of the binding reaction with antiserum that recognizes O/E proteins, the mobility of the 1a complex was specifically retarded (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and4). In contrast, incubation with nonimmune serum or an NF1 antibody did not affect the mobility of the 1a complex (Fig. 2,lanes 5 and 6; note that the NF-1 antibody retarded the mobility of the complexes other than the 1a complex, data not shown and Ref. 13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The O/E binding sequence from the regulatory region of the mb-1 gene (see “Discussion”) specifically competed away the 1a complex as did the M2 oligonucleotide, the response element used in the yeast one-hybrid screen (Fig. 2,lanes 8, 10, and 13). In contrast, oligonucleotides M1 and M4 did not affect the 1a complex (Fig. 2,lanes 11 and 12). When the mutation-containing oligonucleotides were radioactively labeled and used as probes, the results confirmed the findings of the competition experiments,i.e. oligonucleotide M2 was bound by nuclear proteins to form the 1a complex, and oligonucleotides M1 and M4 were not (data not shown). The consensus binding sequence for O/E proteins consists of the palindromic core sequence 5′-CCCnnGGG-3′ (19Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 23Hagman J. Belanger C. Travis A. Turck C.W. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 760-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 24Travis A. Hagman J. Hwang L. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3392-3400Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Hagman J. Gutch M.J. Lin H. Grosschedl R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2907-2916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence contained within the GLUT4 regulatory element (5′-CCCTTGGG-3′, see Fig. 1A) is a perfect core O/E-binding sequence. The M1 and M4 oligonucleotides, which are not bound by nuclear proteins to form the 1a complex, contain mutations that disrupt each of the core half-sites of the O/E-binding sequence. In contrast, the M2 oligonucleotide, which is bound by nuclear proteins to form the 1a complex, contains a mutation that does not disrupt the core O/E-binding sequence. These results are consistent with the identification of an O/E family member as at least one component of the unknown adipocyte protein complex formerly termed 1a. A previously described assay (see “Experimental Procedures” and Refs. 12Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6210-6217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, and 18Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 600-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was used to examine the contribution of the identified O/E-binding site to insulin-induced repression of glut4 gene expression. A portion of the glut4 gene promoter containing the negative insulin-response element was placed upstream of a CAT reporter gene and stably integrated into 3T3-L1 preadipoctyes. When these cells were differentiated into adipocytes and then treated with insulin, both the CAT reporter gene and endogenous glut4 gene were repressed by ∼50% when compared with untreated controls (see wild type, Fig. 3). Mutations within the insulin-response element that do not affect either NF1 or O/E binding activity did not affect the ability of insulin to repress CAT reporter gene expression (see M3, Fig. 3, Ref. 13Cooke D.W. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12917-12924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and reproduced here for comparison). In contrast, mutations that disrupt the O/E-binding site rendered the CAT reporter gene insensitive to insulin-induced repression despite significant repression of the endogenous glut4gene (see M4, Fig. 3). These results indicate that the O/E-binding site located within the negative regulatory element of theglut4 5′-flanking sequence is required for insulin-mediated repression. Experiments were conducted to characterize the expression pattern of O/E proteins in the 3T3-L1 cell line and in white adipose tissue. Nuclear extracts from 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes were subjected to immunoblot analysis using antiserum that recognizes all known O/E family members. Immunoreactive bands were detected in both preadipocytes and adipocytes (Fig.4A, lanes 3 and 4). There is a modest induction of O/E protein during the course of 3T3-L1 differentiation (Fig. 4B). Similar but less intense bands were also observed in mouse white adipose tissue nuclear extract (Fig.4A, lane 5). As expected, a similar immunoreactive band was detected in 293T cells transfected with an O/E-1 expression plasmid but was not detected in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A, lanes 1and 2). The presence of O/E proteins in 3T3-L1 nuclear extracts was confirmed further by using DNA binding assays. When incubated with theglut4 insulin-response element probe, extracts from both preadipocytes and adipocytes formed similar complexes (Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 5). As shown previously, addition of an unlabeled NF1 competitor oligonucleotide prevented visualization of the faster migrating complexes but did not affect the slower migrating O/E-containing complexes (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and6). In contrast, an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the O/E-binding site from the mb-1 gene promoter competed away the slower migrating complexes (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and7). Furthermore, addition of O/E antibodies to the DNA binding reaction retarded the migration of the slower migrating complexes (Fig. 4C, lanes 4 and 8). Nuclear extracts prepared from several insulin-responsive tissues were incubated with the glut4 insulin-response element probe to examine the presence of O/E proteins. As shown previously,"
https://openalex.org/W2014906922,"Environmental factors, such as viral infection, have been implicated as potential triggering events leading to the initial destruction of pancreatic β cells during the development of autoimmune diabetes. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), the active component of a viral infection that stimulates antiviral responses in infected cells, has been shown in combination with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to stimulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide production and to inhibit β cell function. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), the activation of which is induced by dsRNA, viral infection, and IFN-γ, regulates the expression of many antiviral proteins, including PKR, type I IFN, and iNOS. In this study, we show that IRF-1 is not required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-stimulated iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by mouse islets. In contrast to islets, dsRNA + IFN-γ fails to induce iNOS expression or nitric oxide production by macrophages isolated from IRF-1−/− mice; however, dsRNA + IFN-γ induces similar levels of IL-1 release by macrophages isolated from both IRF-1−/− and IRF-1+/+ mice. Importantly, we show that dsRNA- or dsRNA + IFN-γ-stimulated IRF-1 expression by mouse islets and peritoneal macrophages is independent of PKR. These results indicate that IRF-1 is required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by mouse peritoneal macrophages but not by mouse islets. These findings suggest that dsRNA + IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression by two distinct PKR-independent mechanisms; one that is IRF-1-dependent in macrophages and another that is IRF-1-independent in islets.

Importantly, we show that dsRNA- or dsRNA + IFN-γ-stimulated IRF-1 expression by mouse islets and peritoneal macrophages is independent of PKR. These results indicate that IRF-1 is required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by mouse peritoneal macrophages but not by mouse islets. These findings suggest that dsRNA + IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression by two distinct PKR-independent mechanisms; one that is IRF-1-dependent in macrophages and another that is IRF-1-independent in islets. interleukin-1 double-stranded RNA interferon inducible nitric oxide synthase polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid interferon regulatory factor-1 tumor necrosis factor lipopolysaccharide nuclear factor signal transducers and activators of transcription glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase polymerase chain reaction reverse transcription Autoimmune diabetes is characterized by a local inflammatory reaction in and around the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, followed by selective destruction of insulin-producing β cells (1Gepts W.

This inflammatory reaction consists of macrophages, monocytes, T and B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells that infiltrate into the islet after an initial triggering event to cause β cell destruction (2Sibley R.K. Sutherland D.E. Goetz F. Michael A.F. Lab. Invest. 1985; 53: 132-144PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lee K.U. Amano K. Yoon J.W. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism associated with the autoimmune reaction leading to the development of diabetes has been studied in detail, few studies have examined the precipitating events that trigger the initial destruction of β cells leading to this autoimmune inflammatory reaction. We and others have shown that IL-11 induces an inhibition of insulin secretion and the subsequent destruction of rat islets that is mediated by the local production of nitric oxide by β cells (4Mandrup-Poulsen T.

One important source of IL-1 within the islet is the resident macrophage, which produces IL-1 on activation by such stimuli as TNF-α and LPS (6Arnush M. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have shown that activated intraislet macrophages release IL-1 in sufficient quantities within the microenvironment of the islet to stimulate β cell production of nitric oxide and nitric oxide-dependent β cell dysfunction, events that are potentiated by the presence of exogenous IFN-γ (6Arnush M. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar, 7Arnush M. Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Marino M.H. Manning P.T. Corbett J.A. J. Clin.

Autoimmune diabetes can also be induced in genetically susceptible strains of rats and mice by viral infection (8Yoon J.W. Diabetes Metab.

Kilham rat virus-induced diabetes in diabetes-resistant BioBreeding rats is dependent on the presence of macrophages and associated with the increased expression of the macrophage-derived cytokines IL-12, IL-1β, and TNF-α, as well as the T-cell cytokine IFN-γ (13Chung Y.H. Jun H.S. Kang Y. Hirasawa K. Lee B.R. Van Rooijen N. Yoon J.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 466-471PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, encephalomyocarditis virus-induced diabetes in DBA/2 mice can be attenuated by macrophage depletion (14Hirasawa K. Tsutsui S. Takeda M. Mizutani M. Itagaki S. Doi K. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), daily administration of neutralizing antisera specific for IL-1β and TNF-α, or selective inhibition of iNOS using aminoguanidine (AG) (15Hirasawa K.

This evidence suggests that viral infection can stimulate diabetes in genetically susceptible rodents and that disease development is dependent on the production of macrophage- and T-cell-derived cytokines and nitric oxide.One common feature of a viral infection is the formation of dsRNA, which accumulates during viral replication (16Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). dsRNA is an active component of a viral infection that stimulates host antiviral responses, including the production of cytokines and nitric oxide (17Clemens M.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 945-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18Proud C.G. Trends Biochem.

Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) and has been shown to stimulate the development of diabetes in diabetes-resistant BioBreeding rats and to accelerate disease development in diabetes-prone BioBreeding rats (21Ewel C.H.

Diabetes. 1992; 41: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have shown that dsRNA, in combination with IFN-γ, induces islet dysfunction and destruction by a mechanism that is dependent on the expression of iNOS and production of nitric oxide by β cells (23Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12531-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,24Scarim A.L. Arnush M. Blair L.A. Concepcion J. Heitmeier M.R.

In addition, dsRNA + IFN-γ has been shown to stimulate macrophage activation, as evidenced by increased iNOS expression, nitric oxide production, and IL-1 release (23Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12531-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). β cells also produce IL-1 in response to dsRNA + IFN-γ, and β-cell production of IL-1 appears to participate in dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and inhibition of islet function (5Heitmeier M.R. Arnush M. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11151-11158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These findings show that dsRNA can modulate islet function by stimulating the production of inflammatory molecules, such as IL-1 and nitric oxide. However, the mechanisms by which dsRNA stimulates the production of these potentially destructive molecules in islets have not been fully examined.NF-κB and interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) are two transcription factors that participate in gene activation in response to viral infection or dsRNA (25Visvanathan K.V. Goodbourn S. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 26Xanthoudakis S. Cohen L. Hiscott J. J. Biol.

These transcription factors regulate cellular antiviral responses, including the expression of antiviral proteins (type I IFN, PKR, and major histocompatibility complex class I), control of cell cycle progression, and induction of apoptosis (29Tamura T.

Nature. 1984; 310: 650-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Binding elements for both IRF-1 and NF-κB are found in the promoter regions of the rat, mouse, and human iNOS genes (32Beck K.F. Sterzel R.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Chu S.C. Wu H.P. Banks T.C. Eissa N.T. Moss J. J. Biol.

Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). In addition, IRF-1 and NF-κB have been shown to physically interact at the iNOS promoter region, potentially leading to the synergistic activation of iNOS expression observed when both transcription factors are activated (35Saura M. Zaragoza C. Bao C. McMillan A. Lowenstein C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). dsRNA-stimulated activation of both NF-κB and IRF-1 have been shown to require activation of PKR in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (36Kumar A. Yang Y.L. Flati V. Der S. Kadereit S. Deb A. Haque J. Reis L. Weissmann C. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). NF-κB appears to be required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by rat and human islets (37Blair L.A. Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Maggi Jr., L.B. Corbett J.A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), as well as for iNOS and IL-1 expression by mouse peritoneal macrophages (38Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).IRF-1 is a member of a large family of transcription factors activated in response to IFNs. All members of the IRF family of transcription factors bind to the IFN-stimulated response element located in the promoters of many IFN-inducible genes. Some IRFs, such as IRF-1 and ISGF3, activate mRNA transcription, whereas other IRFs, including IRF-2 and ICSBP, repression transcription (39Pitha P.M. Au W.C. Lowther W. Juang Y.T. Schafer S.L. Burysek L. Hiscott J. Moore P.A. Biochimie. 1998; 80: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). IRF-1 is an inducible transcription factor expressed in response to IFN-γ, viral infection, dsRNA, and the cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α (40Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The IRF-1 gene promoter region contains binding elements for both NF-κB and STAT1 (γ-activated site). Binding of either transcription factor to the IRF-1 promoter region is sufficient to induce IRF-1 expression; however, the presence of both NF-κB and STAT1 binding greatly increases IRF-1 transcription (41Gupta S. Xia D. Jiang M. Lee S. Pernis A.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5997-6004PubMed Google Scholar, 42Pine R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). IRF-1 is required for LPS + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression by macrophages (40Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) and appears to participate in IL-1-induced nitric oxide production by mouse islets (43Flodstrom M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2747-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 44Pavlovic D. Chen M.C. Gysemans C.A. Mathieu C. Eizirik D.L. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1999; 10: 403-411PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we examined the role of the inducible transcription factor IRF-1 in dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by both mouse islets and peritoneal macrophages. We show that although IRF-1 is required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by mouse macrophages, dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by mouse islets are IRF-1-independent. In addition, the antiviral protein PKR, which is thought to regulate IRF-1 expression in response to dsRNA, is not required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-stimulated IRF-1 expression by mouse islets or peritoneal macrophages. These results suggest that dsRNA + IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression by two distinct PKR-independent mechanisms, one that is IRF-1-dependent in macrophages and another that is IRF-1-independent in islets.DISCUSSIONBoth genetic and environmental determinants are thought to participate in the development of autoimmune diabetes. Viral infection has been implicated as one environmental factor that may trigger the initial destruction of β cells during the development of diabetes (8Yoon J.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1995; 11: 83-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9von Herrath M.G. Oldstone M.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 878-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Bach J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 516-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Analysis of animal models suggests that inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, as well as nitric oxide, may participate in the development of viral-induced diabetes (13Chung Y.H. Jun H.S. Kang Y. Hirasawa K. Lee B.R. Van Rooijen N. Yoon J.W. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 466-471PubMed Google Scholar). dsRNA is an active component of a viral infection that stimulates antiviral responses in infected cells (16Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Treatment of rat and human islets and primary β cells with dsRNA + IFN-γ results in a potent inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and islet degeneration, events that require β cell production of nitric oxide (23Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12531-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, the signaling mechanisms required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide-dependent islet dysfunction have yet to be defined.In this study, we examined the role of the inducible transcription factor IRF-1 in dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by mouse islets. We show that dsRNA (in the form of poly(I-C)) stimulates IRF-1 expression by mouse islets to levels similar to those stimulated by IFN-γ. Importantly, the level of IRF-1 expressed in response to the combination of dsRNA and IFN-γ appears to be equivalent to the additive effects of either dsRNA or IFN-γ alone on IRF-1 expression. These findings suggest that dsRNA and IFN-γ stimulate IRF-1 expression by distinct pathways. Indeed, the promoter region of the IRF-1 gene contains binding elements for both NF-κB (κB site) and STAT1 (γ-activated site; Refs. 41Gupta S. Xia D. Jiang M. Lee S. Pernis A.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5997-6004PubMed Google Scholar, 42Pine R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These binding elements overlap, creating a composite γ-activated site-κB promoter element to which NF-κB and STAT1 bind in a mutually exclusive and independent manner (42Pine R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). dsRNA has been shown to activate NF-κB in several cell types, including islets (37Blair L.A. Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Maggi Jr., L.B. Corbett J.A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 46Yang Y.L. Reis L.F. Pavlovic J. Aguzzi A. Schafer R. Kumar A. Williams B.R. Aguet M. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6095-6106Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), whereas STAT1 is activated in response to IFN-γ (55Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar). Simultaneous activation of NF-κB and STAT1 (by TNF-α and IFN-γ, respectively) has been shown to stimulate the synergistic induction of IRF-1 that is mediated by the composite γ-activated site-κB element in HepG2 cells (42Pine R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Our observations with dsRNA and IFN-γ are consistent with these findings, suggesting cooperation between NF-κB and STAT1 that leads to increased IRF-1 expression by islets.Islets contain 10–15 resident macrophages that may contribute to β cell destruction by producing the inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and nitric oxide (56Lacy P.E. Finke E.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1183-1190PubMed Google Scholar). Arnush et al. (6Arnush M. Scarim A.L. Heitmeier M.R. Kelly C.B. Corbett J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2684-2691PubMed Google Scholar, 7Arnush M. Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Marino M.H. Manning P.T. Corbett J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 516-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) showed that activation of resident macrophages within the microenvironment of the islet leads to iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by β cells by a mechanism that is dependent on macrophage IL-1 release. In addition, dsRNA + IFN-γ stimulates macrophage activation, as evidenced by increased iNOS expression, nitric oxide production, and IL-1 release (38Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15301-15307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 54Maggi Jr., L.B. Heitmeier M.R. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3630-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, we also examined the role of IRF-1 in the activation of mouse peritoneal macrophages. We show that dsRNA fails to stimulate IRF-1 expression by macrophages. This is in contrast to mouse islets, where IRF-1 expression is greatly increased after a 3-h treatment. However, dsRNA appears to potentiate IFN-γ-stimulated IRF-1 expression by macrophages. This is similar to findings in mouse islets, where maximal IRF-1 expression requires the activation of two transcription factors (NF-κB and STAT1).IRF-1 is required for LPS + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression by macrophages, because LPS + IFN-γ fails to induce iNOS expression in macrophages isolated from IRF-1-deficient mice (40Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilcek J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). We show that dsRNA + IFN-γ also fails to induce iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by peritoneal macrophages isolated from IRF-1−/− mice. This finding is in contrast to mouse islets, where dsRNA + IFN-γ induces iNOS expression and nitric oxide production in the absence of IRF-1. These results suggest that dsRNA + IFN-γ stimulates iNOS expression by two distinct mechanisms, one that is IRF-1-dependent (macrophages) and another that is IRF-1-independent (islets).Although IRF-1 is required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced nitric oxide production by macrophages, we do not see a decrease in dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced nitric oxide production by islets isolated from IRF-1−/− mice, which contain resident macrophages. These results imply that resident islet macrophages do not contribute significantly to total islet nitric oxide production in response to dsRNA + IFN-γ. This finding is in concordance with previous studies showing that dsRNA + IFN-γ induces iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by rat islets depleted of resident macrophages (23Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12531-12536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).One mechanism by which macrophages may contribute to dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced islet dysfunction is by the production and release of IL-1, which may then stimulate β cells to express iNOS and produce nitric oxide. We show that dsRNA + IFN-γ induces IL-1 release to similar levels in peritoneal macrophages isolated from IRF-1−/− and IRF-1+/+ mice. β cells also produce and release IL-1 in response to dsRNA + IFN-γ. Recent studies have shown that β cell production of IL-1β partially mediates dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by rat islets and primary β cells (5Heitmeier M.R. Arnush M. Scarim A.L. Corbett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11151-11158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced nitric oxide production is reduced by ∼50% in islets isolated from mice deficient in the type I IL-1 receptor. 2L. A. Blair and J. A. Corbett, unpublished observations. We show that dsRNA + IFN-γ induces IL-1 expression by peritoneal macrophages and islets and IL-1 release by peritoneal macrophages isolated from both IRF-1−/− and IRF-1+/+ mice. Importantly, cycloheximide prevents dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced IL-1β mRNA accumulation by islets isolated from IRF-1−/− mice. This implies that an inducible factor other than IRF-1 is required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced IL-1 expression by islets. Potential factors whose expression may be induced in islets by dsRNA are currently being examined by our laboratory.We have shown that dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by mouse islets and peritoneal macrophages do not require the antiviral kinase PKR (37Blair L.A. Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Maggi Jr., L.B. Corbett J.A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 54Maggi Jr., L.B. Heitmeier M.R. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3630-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that dsRNA-stimulated NF-κB activation in both islets and peritoneal macrophages is PKR-independent (37Blair L.A. Heitmeier M.R. Scarim A.L. Maggi Jr., L.B. Corbett J.A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 54Maggi Jr., L.B. Heitmeier M.R. Scheuner D. Kaufman R.J. Buller R.M. Corbett J.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3630-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we show that dsRNA and dsRNA + IFN-γ-stimulated IRF-1 expression is also independent of PKR. These results are in contrast to previous studies showing that PKR is required for dsRNA-induced IRF-1 and NF-κB activation by mouse embryonic fibroblasts (36Kumar A. Yang Y.L. Flati V. Der S.

The mechanisms responsible for the differences in dsRNA responsiveness of embryonic fibroblasts compared with islets or macrophages are unknown. However, recent studies by Iordanov et al. (57Iordanov M.S. Wong J. Bell J.C. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) question the role of PKR in dsRNA-stimulated NF-κB activation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.In summary, we have examined the potential role of the inducible transcription factor IRF-1 in dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by both mouse islets and peritoneal macrophages. We show that dsRNA (or dsRNA + IFN-γ) stimulates IRF-1 expression by mouse islets and peritoneal macrophages and that this expression is PKR-independent. Importantly, we show that IRF-1 is not required for dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by mouse islets. In contrast, dsRNA + IFN-γ-induced iNOS expression and nitric oxide production by mouse peritoneal macrophages requires IRF-1 expression. We also show that IRF-1 is not required for dsRNA-induced IL-1 expression by mouse peritoneal macrophages or islets. These results suggest that IRF-1 plays a minimal role in mediating the destructive effects of dsRNA and IFN-γ on mouse islets. Autoimmune diabetes is characterized by a local inflammatory reaction in and around the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, followed by selective destruction of insulin-producing β cells (1Gepts W. Diabetes. 1965; 14: 619-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 2Sibley R.K. Sutherland D.E. Goetz F. Michael A.F. Lab. Invest. 1985; 53: 132-144PubMed Google Scholar). This inflammatory reaction consists of macrophages, monocytes, T and B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells that infiltrate into the islet after an initial triggering event to cause β cell destruction (2Sibley R.K.

Although the mechanism associated with the autoimmune reaction leading to the development of diabetes has been studied in detail, few studies have examined the precipitating events that trigger the initial destruction of β cells leading to this autoimmune inflammatory reaction. We and others have shown that IL-11 induces an inhibition of insulin secretion and the subsequent de"

We produced a recombinant full-length chicken α-tropomyosin containing a 5-hydroxytryptophan residue at position 269 (formerly an alanine), 15 residues from the C terminus, and show that its fluorescence intensity specifically reports tropomyosin head-to-tail interactions. We used this property to quantitatively study the monomer-polymer equilibrium in tropomyosin and to calculate the equilibrium constant of the head-to-tail interaction as a function of ionic strength. Our results show that the affinity constant changes by almost 2 orders of magnitude over an ionic strength range of 50 mm (between I = 0.045 and 0.095). We were also able to calculate the average polymer length as a function of concentration and ionic strength, which is an important parameter in the interpretation of binding isotherms of tropomyosin with other thin filament proteins such as actin and troponin.

Analysis of its primary structure revealed the existence of an extensive and almost perfect heptad repeat (abcdefg) in which hydrophobic residues at positions a and d create a dimerization interface that stabilizes the coiled-coil structure (6Sodek J. Hodges R.S. Smillie L.B. Jurasek L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 62: 3800-3804Google Scholar,7Stone D. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis of tropomyosin sequences also uncovered seven 39.5-residue pseudo-repeats, which may reflect the tropomyosin 7:1 binding stoichiometry with actin (8McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 271-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Also associated with both tropomyosin and actin is the troponin complex, which consists of the Ca2+ binding subunit (troponin C), the inhibitory subunit (troponin I), and the tropomyosin binding subunit (TnT). Tn-Tm interactions occur mainly between the C-terminal half of TnT and the region near position 190 of Tm and between the N-terminal half of TnT and the C-terminal of the Tm molecule (for review, see Refs.9Zot A.S.

Muscle tropomyosin high viscosity at low ionic strength was noted from the time of its first isolation (14Bailey K. Biochem. J. 1948; 43: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Soon thereafter Tsao et al. (15Tsao T.-C. Bailey K. Adair G.S. Biochem. J. 1951; 49: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) describe the ionic strength dependence of the viscosity in more detail and Kay and Bailey (16Kay C.M. Bailey K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 40: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) relate changes in the polymer length with salt concentration and propose that polymerization is due to simple end-to-end or head-to-tail aggregation, which was later confirmed by in-depth studies of cardiac Tm via sedimentation velocity, sedimentation equilibrium, osmometry, viscometry, and optical rotatory dispersion (17McCubbin W.D. Kay C.M. Can. J. Biochem. 1969; 47: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although muscle Tm is acetylated at its N terminus, recombinant non-fusion Tm (nfTm) expressed in bacteria lacks this modification and does not polymerize or bind to actin (18Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E.

Commun. 2001; 284: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) has its N terminus acetylated and is functional. Because the N-acetylated initiation methionine in the native protein occupies an internal position in the coiled-coil structure (position a), repulsions between the positively charged α-amino groups in the recombinant protein were thought to destabilize the local coiled-coil structure as well as the head-to-tail interaction responsible for polymerization (19Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An N-terminal dipeptide fusion (ASTm) reduces these repulsions by placing the charged α-amino group at an external position (f) and restores the polymerization and actin binding properties of Tm (19Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This view is confirmed by the recent high resolution structures of N-terminal fragments of acetylated and non-acetylated tropomyosin; the acetylated fragment maintains the coiled-coil structure up to the N terminus (22Greenfield N.J. Montelione G.T. Farid R.S. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7834-7843Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas the first two residues in the unacetylated fragment are non-helical (23Brown J.H. Kim K.H. Jun G. Greenfield N.J. Dominguez R. Volkmann N. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The structure of full-length Tm has only been resolved to 7 Å due to its high flexibility and asymmetry (24Whitby F.G. Phillips Jr., G.N. Proteins. 2000; 38: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Tm crystals show a repeat distance of 410 Å, less than that expected for a molecule containing 284 α-helical residues (∼423 Å). The size difference was proposed to correspond to the overlap between Tm molecules (25Caspar D.L. Cohen C. Longley W. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 41: 87-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 26Cohen C. Caspar D.L. Parry D.A. Lucas R.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 36: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The removal of more than three C-terminal amino acids or chemical modification of the ε-NH2 group of Lys-7 abolishes Tm polymerization (27Johnson P. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2264-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Heeley et al. (28Heeley D.H. Watson W.H. Mak A.S. Dubord P. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2424-2430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) show that native Tm, which is phosphorylated at Ser-283, has a greater viscosity than unphosphorylated Tm, but actin and Tn binding ability was the same for both forms. McLachlan and Stewart (29McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) propose a model for the Tm head-to-tail interaction involving nine N-terminal and C-terminal residues from each tropomyosin chain, in which they attempted to maximize hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Very few quantitative measures of the thermodynamics of the tropomyosin head-to-tail interaction have been performed (30Asai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1961; 50: 183-189Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 31Ooi T. Mihashi K. Kobayashi H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 98: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Sano K. Maeda K. Oda T. Maeda Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) due to the heterogeneity of solutions containing polymers of different lengths. Asai (30Asai H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1961; 50: 183-189Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar) attempts to calculate K as a function of ionic strength but only in the range 0–12 mm KCl, 2 mm phosphate, whereas Ooi et al. (31Ooi T. Mihashi K. Kobayashi H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 98: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) calculatesK at 0.1 and 1 m. Sano et al. (32Sano K. Maeda K. Oda T. Maeda Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) studies the head-to-tail interaction using recombinant N- and C-terminal tropomyosin fragments. All groups arrived at Kvalues between 2 × 104 and 1.25 × 105m−1 for ionic strengths that varied from less than 0.01 to 1.0, which is surprising in light of the strong ionic strength dependence of viscosity of micromolar tropomyosin solutions in this range. Quantitative measures of the thermodynamics of the Tm head-to-tail interaction are important for the interpretation of binding isotherms between Tm and other thin filament proteins, especially since mutations that influence Tm polymerization also affect its interactions with Tn and actin. Because Tm interactions with these proteins are strongly ionic strength-dependent, a quantitative analysis of the ionic strength dependence of polymerization thermodynamics is also important. With this aim in mind, we have produced a recombinant tropomyosin with a fluorescent 5-hydroxytryptophan probe at position 269, located 15 residues from the C terminus of the polypeptide chain. 5-Hydroxytryptophan probes at other positions in this region are specifically sensitive to TnT binding and actin binding (33Sousa A.D. Farah C.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (Abstr. 407–POS): 91Google Scholar, 34Oliveira D.M. Nakaie C.R. Sousa A.D. Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27513-27519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We show that the fluorescence of this probe is sensitive to Tm polymerization and use this property to study polymerization thermodynamics as a function of ionic strength. The alanine codon at position 269 of the chicken skeletal α-tropomyosin cDNA (35Gooding C. Reinach F.C. Macleod A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 158105Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was substituted for a tryptophan codon by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis using the bacterial expression vector constructs pET-MASTmy and pET-Tmy (19Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as templates. These vectors direct the expression of tropomyosin with a dipeptide Ala-Ser N-terminal fusion (after in vivo removal of the N-terminal methionine) or non-fusion tropomyosin, respectively. The PCR reactions were performed using the following pairs of oligonucleotides: oligoBSTEII+, 5′-AAGAGATCCAGCTTAAAGAAG-3′, plus oligoA269W−, 5′-CCTCGCTGATCCATTTGTACTTC-3′, or oligo EcoRI−, 5′-CATTAACCTATAAAAATAGGCG-3′, plus oligoA269W+, 5′-GAAGTACAAATGGATCAGCGAGG-3. The products of these two reactions were combined, denatured, renatured, and amplified using oligoBstEII+ and oligo EcoRI− as described (36Higuchi M. Wong C. Kochhan L. Aronis S. Kasper C.K. Kazazian Jr., H.H. Antonarakis S.E. Genomics. 1990; 6: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The amplified product was subcloned into pET-MASTmy or pET-Tmy previously digested withBstEII and EcoRI, resulting in the production of pET-MAS269W and pET-nf269W. The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (37Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 74: 5463-5467Crossref Scopus (52770) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the mutant tropomyosins containing 5-hydroxytryptophan at position 269 (AS269(5OHW) and nf269(5OHW)) were performed as described previously (38Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10543-10551Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The recombinant tropomyosins ASTm and nfTm were expressed and purified as described (19Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Recombinant chicken fast skeletal troponin I, troponin C, and TnT were expressed and purified separately, and the troponin complex was reconstituted as described (39Quaggio R.B. Ferro J.A. Monteiro P.B. Reinach F.C. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1053-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 40Farah C.S. Myiamoto C.A. Ramos C.H. da Silva A.C. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie R.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tropomyosin and troponin concentration were determined according to the method described by Hartree (41Hartree E.F. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) using ASTm as a standard (ε 278nm1% = 2.9 (19Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Actin was prepared from chicken pectoral muscle (42Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined by its absorbance at 290 nm (43Johnson K.A. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3432-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Actin (14 μm), the specified tropomyosin (2 μm) and in some cases troponin (2 μm) were combined in fluorescence buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). The mixtures were homogenized and centrifuged at 315,000 × g for 20 min at 25 °C. In qualitative assays, binding was detected by analyzing equivalent volumes of mixtures before centrifugation and samples corresponding to the supernatant and pellet after centrifugation in 15% SDS-PAGE (44Laemmili U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Recombinant Tms were dialyzed against 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 100 mmKCl, and circular dichroism studies were carried out using a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C. Viscosity measurements were carried out at 21 °C using a Cannon-Manning semi-microviscometer (A50) with a buffer outflow time of 236–241 s. Each point in Fig.2A corresponds to an 8-μm Tm solution in fluorescence buffer at the specified NaCl concentration after equilibration for 7 h at 21 ± 1 °C. Fluorescence spectra of mixtures containing tropomyosins with 5-hydroxytryptophan residues were determined using a F-4500 Hitachi spectrofluorimeter (excitation, 312 nm; excitation and emission slit bandwidths, 5 nm; temperature, 25 °C). The effect of the ionic strength on the emission spectrum of AS269(5OHW) was determined in fluorescence buffer with NaCl concentrations varying from 10 to 350 mm and Tm concentrations varying between 0.5 and 8 μm. Each point of each curve in Fig. 3A corresponds to the fluorescence intensity of a 1.5-ml mixture of the protein at a specific NaCl concentration. Samples were equilibrated for 7 h at 25 °C before taking the spectra, and the emission intensity was determined by summing the emissions at all wavelengths between 330 and 380 nm. The fluorescence intensity was corrected for the inner filter effect, which was only significant at high Tm concentrations and never exceeded 14%. We begin with the premise that the probe can exist in two environments, free or “polymerized,” with different fluorescence intensity in each state (Fmin andFmax, respectively; see Figs. 1 and 3). The free probe concentration is equal to the polymer concentration, since each polymer has only one C terminus regardless its length (Fig.1D). As the ionic strength increases, the affinity of the head-to-tail interaction decreases until essentially all Tm is in the monomeric state, at which point the base line of the titration (see thearrow in Fig. 3A) corresponds to the intrinsic fluorescence of the free probes (Fmin). The data in Fig. 3A were normalized with respect to the Tm concentration and the Fmin for each curve. We define fo as the fraction of probes in the free environment, i.e. the fraction of Tm molecules whose C termini are not involved in a head-to-tail interaction.fo=(FmaxN−FN)/(FmaxN−1)Equation 1 where FN and FmaxNare, respectively, the actual and maximal fluorescence intensities, both normalized with respect to protein concentration and toFmin. fo is also equivalent to <i>−1, where <i> is the average number of monomers per polymer chain,fo=〈i〉−1=[polymers]/[λtot]Equation 2 =(λ1+λ2+λ3…λi)/λtot=∑i=1Ki−1λ1i/λtotwhere λtot is the total tropomyosin concentration, λi is the i-mer concentration, and K is the affinity constant for the head-to-tail interaction (45Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 46Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. Part I: The Conformation of Biological Macromolecules. W. H.

We can then show the following.fo=∑i=1K−1·Kiλ1i/λtot=∑i=1(Kλ1)i/KλtotEquation 3 Because Σxi = x/(1−x), we arrive at the expression,fo=λ1/[λtot(1−Kλ1)]Equation 4 so long as λ1 < K−1. In their analysis of linear polymerization equilibria, Oosawa and Kasai (45Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol.

Using a fixed value ofFmaxN = 1.55 (see Fig. 3A), we recalculated K at each ionic strength, the values of which are shown in Fig. 4. The values for K obtained using a fixed or variable value for FmaxN were not significantly different (±50% and usually much less) for the ionic strengths shown in Fig. 4 (between I = 0.045 and 0.095). As can be seen by inspection of Fig. 3, at ionic strengths below or above this range (20–70 mm NaCl), the observed change in intrinsic fluorescence as a function of tropomyosin concentration was too little to accurately estimateK. We analyzed a series of recombinant Tm mutants containing 5-hydroxytryptophan at a number of positions along its primary structure. The fluorescent probe can be selectively excited at wavelengths above 300 nm, where tryptophan-containing proteins do not absorb (Fig. 1C). We found that the fluorescence of 5-hydroxytryptophan incorporated at position 269 (AS269(5OHW)) is sensitive to ionic strength variations, which lead to Tm depolymerization (Fig. 1A). Although the λmax of the emission spectrum remains constant, the fluorescence intensity decreases ∼38% as the NaCl concentration is raised from 10 to 300 mm (Fig. 1A). The fluorescence of the mutant with tryptophan (instead of 5-hydroxytryptophan), incorporated at the same position (AS269W), is also sensitive to ionic strength, but in this case the decrease in intensity is accompanied by a red shift (data not shown). This combined spectral shift plus intensity change complicates quantitative analysis in terms of a two-state equilibrium (47Eftink M.R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 482-501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). For this reason, we chose to use the variation of the intensity of fluorescence of AS269(5OHW) to investigate the head-to-tail interaction of Tm. By exciting at 312 nm, we eliminate any fluorescence contribution from the small fraction (38Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10543-10551Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,48Das K. Ashby K.D. Smirnov A.V. Reinach F.C. Petrich J.W. Farah C.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 719-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) of Tm molecules containing tryptophan instead of 5-hydroxytryptophan (Fig. 1C). In contrast to AS269(5OHW), the fluorescence of the non-fusion mutant labeled at position 269 that does not polymerize, nf269(5OHW), is insensitive to ionic strength variations (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the fluorescence intensities of other polymerizable Tm mutants labeled with 5-hydroxytryptophan at nearby positions in the primary structure (positions 261, 263, and 267 (33Sousa A.D. Farah C.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (Abstr. 407–POS): 91Google Scholar)), in the center (position 185), or in the N-terminal half of the protein (positions 90, 101, 111, and 122 (38Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10543-10551Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)) are insensitive to ionic strength variations. We attempted to determine whether the mutation at position 269, both in the presence and absence of the dipeptide N-terminal fusion, significantly affected other properties of Tm such as actin-binding (+/−Tn), circular dichroism, and viscosity (Fig.2). No significant differences in the CD spectra of the four proteins (ASTm, nfTm, AS269(5OHW), and nf269(5OHW) were observed (Fig. 2C), indicating that the mutations do not significantly affect the overall secondary structure of the molecule. Local secondary structure changes induced by the mutation, however, cannot be ruled out due to limitations in the sensitivity of this method. Because residue 269 corresponds to an external position (c) in the heptad repeat of tropomyosin (29McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), the stereospecific interactions at the interface between the two α-helices in the coiled-coil structure should not be disrupted. The kinematic viscosity of the four recombinant tropomyosins was determined at a series of ionic strengths (Fig.2A). As expected (19Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recombinant tropomyosins with an N-terminal Ala-Ser dipeptide fusion present salt-dependent viscosity dependence, whereas non-fusion recombinant tropomyosins have significantly reduced viscosity at all ionic strengths tested. We did not observe any significant difference between the viscosities of ASTm and AS269(5OHW) or between nfTm and nf269(5OHW) (Fig.2A). This indicates that the mutation at position 269 does not lead to significant changes in the intermolecular interactions responsible for tropomyosin polymerization. We checked the actin and troponin binding ability of the four tropomyosins in co-sedimentation assays (Fig. 2B and data not shown). These assays showed that AS269(5OHW) is able to bind actin and mediates the binding of troponin to thin filaments, similar to ASTm (19Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, nf269(5OHW) does not bind actin on its own but does bind in the presence of troponin, just as previously observed for nfTm (Fig. 2B and Ref. 19Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The above analysis indicates that the probe at position 269 does not significantly affect tropomyosin interactions with actin or troponin or its salt-dependent polymerization. Because the only chemical difference between AS269(5OHW) and nf269(5OHW) is the presence or absence of an N-terminal dipeptide Ala-Ser fusion ∼40 nm from the 5-hydroxtryptophan probe, we conclude that the fluorescence intensity of the probe at position 269 (Fig. 1A) is sensitive the head-to-tail interaction responsible for tropomyosin polymerization. Fig. 1D presents a scheme for the linear polymerization of tropomyosin in which the 5-hydroxytryptophan probe can exist in one of two environments, (i) a “polymerized” environment (filled circles in the figure, maximum fluorescence intensity), where the C-terminal end of the tropomyosin molecule to which the probe is covalently attached interacts with the N-terminal end of another tropomyosin molecule, and (ii) a free environment (open circles, minimum fluorescence intensity), which occurs only at the C-terminal ends of each tropomyosin polymer and in free monomers. Therefore, the fraction of probes in the free environment is directly proportional to the total polymer concentration (where monomers are considered polymers of chain length (i) = 1). The fraction of probes in each environment is a function of the total tropomyosin concentration and the equilibrium association constant (K) of the head-to-tail interaction under the conditions specified. Oosawa and Kasai (45Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) show that if we assume that this equilibrium constant is independent of chain length, we can calculate the concentration of each species as a function of the K and the total Tm concentration (see “Experimental Procedures”). We therefore studied the thermodynamics of the tropomyosin head-to-tail interaction by monitoring the ionic strength dependence of the fluorescence intensity at a number of Tm concentrations, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.3A shows representative curves for the ionic strength-dependent changes in fluorescence intensity of AS269(5OHW). At low ionic strength and high Tm concentrations, the normalized (for concentration) fluorescence intensity of the probe is maximum, whereas at high ionic strength and low protein concentrations the fluorescence of the probe is significantly reduced. This is also evident in Fig. 3B, where the extent of polymerization (1 − fo) at selected ionic strengths was plotted against tropomyosin concentration. As expected (45Oosawa F. Kasai M. J. Mol. Biol. 1962; 4: 10-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), the extent of polymerization at a specific ionic strength can be seen to be dependent on the total protein concentration. The data was fit to Equation 8 to obtain the affinity constants for the head-to-tail interaction at a number of ionic strengths (Fig. 4). In Fig. 4B we see that between [NaCl] = 20 mm(I = 0.045) and [NaCl] = 70 mm(I = 0.095), the equilibrium constant for the head-to-tail interaction varies by almost 2 orders of magnitude (1.9 × 107m−1 ± 1.1 × 106 and 3.5 × 105m−1 ± 6.5 × 104, respectively). At ionic strengths below or above this range, the observed change in intrinsic fluorescence as a function of tropomyosin concentration was too little to accurately estimate K. However, a plot of log K versus[I]0.5 reveals an essentially linear relationship (Fig. 4B) from which K at any ionic strength may be interpolated (log K = 11.1 − 18.0[I]0.5). This result can be combined with Equation 7 and fo = <i>−1to explicitly describe the interdependence of <i>,K, and total Tm concentration (λtot). This relationship is presented as a three-dimensional surface in Fig.5A. In Fig. 5B, we see that within the range 0.05 < I < 0.1 and 1 μm < [Tm] < 10 μm, <i> may vary from 1 to 10. Because the relationship between log Kand I0.5 is certainly not truly linear over a wide range of ionic strengths (see Discussion and Refs. 49Pitzer K.S. Mayorga G. J.

The AGT gene in Xenopus laevis encodes a polypeptide of 415 amino acids, which includes a 24-residue N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), at either end of which are located two in-frame potential translation start sites. This MTS is necessary to target Xenopus AGT and sufficient to target a green fluorescent fusion protein to mitochondria in transfected COS cells. The C-terminal tripeptide (KKM), despite being similar to the nonconsensus type 1 peroxisomal targeting sequence in human AGT (KKL), was unable to target Xenopus AGT or human AGT to peroxisomes. The Xenopus AGT gene produces two types of transcript. The longer form encodes a polypeptide that contains the MTS and is targeted to mitochondria. The shorter form encodes a polypeptide that does not contain the MTS and remains in the cytosol. These results are discussed not only in terms of the molecular evolution of AGT targeting but also in terms of the ancillary requirements for the peroxisomal targeting of human AGT.

Fryer P. Jennings P.R. Allsop J. Griffiths S. Cunningham A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 295-313PubMed Google Scholar, 2Danpure C.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Although there are a number of exceptions, there appears to be a general rule that AGT in the hepatocytes of carnivores or insectivores (e.g. cat, dog, shrew, mole, and hedgehog) tends to be mainly mitochondrial, whereas that in herbivores (e.g. gorilla, orangutan, saki monkey, rabbit, guinea pig, fruit bat, koala, and wallaby) tends to be peroxisomal. In omnivores (e.g. marmosets, tamarins, rodents, and opossum) AGT is usually more evenly distributed between mitochondria and peroxisomes. The guinea pig has significant levels of cytosolic AGT in addition to peroxisomal AGT (3Birdsey G.M. Danpure C.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). No mammals have been identified so far with both mitochondrial and cytosolic AGT. However, such a distribution has been found in the common frog (1Danpure C.J. Fryer P. Jennings P.R. Allsop J. Griffiths S. Cunningham A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 295-313PubMed Google Scholar). We have suggested previously (1Danpure C.J. Fryer P. Jennings P.R. Allsop J. Griffiths S. Cunningham A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 295-313PubMed Google Scholar, 2Danpure C.J. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) that the variable dual distribution of organellar AGT in mammalian hepatocytes reflects a dual metabolic role of gluconeogenesis (in the mitochondria) and glyoxylate detoxification (in the peroxisomes). Whether cytosolic AGT, when present, has any particular metabolic function is unknown. Gluconeogenesis might be expected to be more important in evolutionary terms for carnivores and insectivores because of their high protein and low carbohydrate diets, whereas glyoxylate detoxification might be expected to be more important for herbivores because their diets are more likely to contain relatively high levels of oxalate and oxalate precursors, most of which are metabolized to oxalate via glyoxylate. Oxalate cannot be metabolized further in mammals, and when present above certain levels oxalate causes severe problems due to the very low solubility of its calcium salt, which can crystallize out in the kidney and urinary tract as stones (4Danpure C.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Molecular and Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease.

Avner E.D. Harmon W.E. Pediatric Nephrology. Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore1999: 609-619Google Scholar). Humans seem to be an exception to the general diet-AGT distribution rule by having peroxisomal AGT (7Cooper P.J. Danpure C.J. Wise P.J. Guttridge K.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), even though most people could probably be categorized as omnivores. In all the species studied so far (i.e. human, marmoset, cat, rat, guinea pig, and rabbit), AGT is encoded by a single gene that has the potential to encode N-terminal mitochondrial and C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequences (3Birdsey G.M. Danpure C.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 8Takada Y. Kaneko N. Esumi H. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Biochem.

Biochem. 1994; 221: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The variable targeting of AGT in mammals appears to be dependent on the variable use of two in-frame translation start sites, which straddle the region encoding the 22-amino acid-cleavable N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), and two groups of transcription start sites, one upstream of both translation start sites and one between them (10Oda T. Funai T. Ichiyama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7513-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Oatey P.B. Lumb M.J. Danpure C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (see Fig.9A). Transcription and translation from the more 5′-sites yield a polypeptide possessing an MTS, whereas in the polypeptide produced following transcription or translation from the more 3′-sites, the MTS is missing. Whereas the mitochondrial targeting of AGT appears to be fairly straightforward, its peroxisomal targeting is rather unusual. Most peroxisomal proteins are targeted by a C-terminal tripeptide based on the consensus motif S/A/C-K/R/H-L/M (13Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 14Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Subramani S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This type 1 peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1) interacts directly with the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of the recycling PTS1 import receptor Pex5p (15Gatto G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 16Dammai V. Subramani S. Cell. 2001; 105: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Although the peroxisomal import of AGT is also mediated by Pex5p (17Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. De Jennings P.R. Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and is therefore presumably imported via the PTS1 pathway, its C-terminal tripeptides in mammals rarely achieve better than a two out of three match with the consensus PTS1. At least in the case of human AGT, its nonconsensus PTS1 (i.e. KKL) is necessary for peroxisomal import but insufficient to direct the peroxisomal import of a variety of reporter proteins (17Motley A. Lumb M.J. Oatey P.B. De Jennings P.R. Zoysa P.A. Wanders R.J. Tabak H.F. Danpure C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Oatey P.B. Lumb M.J. Jennings P.R. Danpure C.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 652-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The importance of hepatic AGT in minimizing the endogenous oxalate production in at least some mammals is clearly shown by the autosomal recessive disorder of glyoxylate metabolism primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) (4Danpure C.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Molecular and Metabolic Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3323-3367Google Scholar), a potentially lethal condition in which AGT deficiency leads to excessive oxalate synthesis and excretion and the deposition of insoluble calcium oxalate in the kidney. PH1 also shows the importance of the correct intracellular compartmentalization of AGT. Although most patients have a complete absence of AGT, a significant subset do have catalytically active AGT, but it is mistargeted from the peroxisomes to the mitochondria (19Danpure C.J. Cooper P.J. Wise P.J. Jennings P.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) where it is unable to detoxify glyoxylate efficiently, thus allowing more to be oxidized to oxalate. It is quite common to find peroxisomal enzymes in the cytosol, especially the classical peroxisomal marker catalase (20Yamamoto K. Volkl A. Fahimi H.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1909-1918Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 21Bulitta C. Ganea C. Fahimi H.D. Volkl A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1293: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the case of guinea pig AGT, its presence in the cytosol appears to be due to an intrinsic inefficiency with which the guinea pig peroxisomal import machinery can deal with the nonconsensus PTS1 HRL (3Birdsey G.M. Danpure C.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 49-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, it is rare to find mitochondrial enzymes in the cytosol to any significant extent, presumably because a failure of mitochondrial import leads to rapid degradation. The few examples that are known result from alternative transcription or translation initiation, similar to that found for mammalian AGT, or from import being partially thwarted due to the presence of tightly folded import-incompetent conformations in the protein cargo (22Danpure C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 230-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have attempted to gain a better understanding of the molecular evolution of AGT targeting by studying its distribution in a phylum not studied before (i.e. the Amphibia). We have determined the molecular basis for its dual mitochondrial and cytosolic localization in the liver of an amphibian exemplar, Xenopus laevis. In addition, we have embarked on preliminary studies that might help explain some of the unusual characteristics of human AGT peroxisomal targeting. Fresh liver samples from common frog (Rana temporis), bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), palmate newt (Triturus helvetica), pobblebonk (Limnodynastes dumerillii), and Xenopus (X. laevis) were kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Cunningham, Institute of Zoology, London, UK, or the Biological Services Department, University College London, UK. Fresh samples of liver were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and prepared for post-embedding protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy as described previously (7Cooper P.J. Danpure C.J. Wise P.J. Guttridge K.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1988; 36: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Danpure C.J. Cooper P.J. Wise P.J. Jennings P.R. J.

Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 669-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive AGT was detected using monospecific rabbit anti-human AGT antiserum and protein A-gold (10 or 20 nm). In some cases, the sections were also labeled with rabbit anti-human liver catalase antiserum and protein A-gold (10 nm) to label the peroxisomes. Standard recombinant DNA methodologies (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used unless indicated otherwise. The primers used to make the various Xenopus AGT cDNA clones are described in Table I, and the overall cloning strategy is outlined in Fig.1. A total of 300,000 plaques from aXenopus liver cDNA expression library in the Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene) were screened using rabbit anti-human AGT antiserum. Following secondary and tertiary screens, seven positive plaques were identified, one of which (pXS) had a strong similarity to AGT cDNAs isolated from other species. For expression studies, pXS was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to give pXlAGT(short).Table IPrimers used in the present studyPrimerMaps toStrandP1CATCATGGTACCGTCATCAGGTGTAACAGCCTCX, 16–36+P2CATCATCTCGAGCGTCATCTTCAGCAAACAGGX, 1499–1480−P3CATCATGAATTCGGGACTAGGTGAAGGTTCACX, 163–187+P4CATCATGAATTCGCCTCTCTGCTCCTGTCAGX, 276–295+P5CATCATGGATCCGATTCTGACAGGAGCAGAGAGX, 299–279−P6CTTCCCACAGTCACCACTGH, 952–970+P7GTGGCAAGCGAAGACATGX, 316–299−P8GAATCCGAGGAGGTACATTGGAGX, 408–386−P9GTGTCCGGATCCACTCACAGCX, 545–525−P10CATCATGGGCCCTCACAGCTTGCTTTTGGGACX, 1475–1456−P11CATCATGGGCCCTCACAGCTTTTTTTTGGGACX, 1475–1456−P12CATCATGGATCCTCACATCTTCTTCTTGGGGCAGTGH, 1179–1156−The following primers contain restriction sites (bold and underlined): P1 KpnI, P2 XhoI, P3 EcoRI, P4,EcoRI, P5 BamHI, P10 ApaI, P11ApaI, P12 BamHI.

On comparison with AGTs from other species, it was clear that, although the library clone pXS extended to the poly(A) tail at the 3′-end, at the 5′-end it extended to only 23 bp upstream of the more 3′ of the ancestral translation start sites. Therefore, it did not include the region homologous to the more 5′-translation start site (see Fig. 1). To acquire more 5′-sequence, especially to determine the presence or absence of this 5′-site, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was carried out (25Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). This was performed using the 5′/3′-RACE kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out usingXenopus liver total RNA and primer P9 (Table I and Fig. 1). The cDNA was purified using the High Pure PCR Product Purification kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After tailing of the 5′-end of the cDNA with dATP, the dA-tailed cDNA was used as template in a PCR amplification reaction using an oligo(dT)-anchor primer and theXenopus-specific primer P8. A twentieth of this product was used as template in a second round of PCR amplification using the PCR-anchor primer and Xenopus-specific primer P7 (Table Iand Fig. 1). This yielded two products of ∼70 and 350 bp that were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The shorter RACE product did not extend significantly beyond the 5′-end of pXS and was termed RACE-S. However, the longer product extended 276 bp upstream of pXS and included the more 5′-ancestral translation start site. This RACE product was termed RACE-L. To check that RACE-L and pXS were derived from the same transcript, reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out on total Xenopusliver RNA, using oligo(dT) as the primer for first strand synthesis and then primer pairs P1/P2 and P3/P2. The longer P1/P2 product (Xall) appeared to be recombinogenic and refractory to cloning. The shorter P3/P2 product (XL) was cloned into pcDNA3 to give pXlAGT(long). All clones (or PCR products in the case of Xall) were sequenced in both strands, and where they overlapped (see Fig. 1) the sequences were identical. The RACE results could indicate thatXenopus liver contains two types of AGT transcript, one extending upstream of the 3′-ancestral start site but downstream of the 5′-site, and one upstream of both sites, as has been found before in mammals such as the marmoset and rat. To test this, Xenopusliver AGT transcripts were mapped by RNase protection. A 5′-clone was made by digesting pXlAGT(long) withEcoRV and XhoI, blunt ending and re-ligation to give pXL-5′ (see Fig. 1). Following linearization withHindIII, an antisense riboprobe was generated from the T7 RNA polymerase promoter in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (600 Ci/mmol). Total RNA (20 μg) prepared from Xenopusliver was hybridized for 16 h at 45 °C with the antisense riboprobe (105 cpm). Following digestion with RNase A and T1, the protected fragments were separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel and visualized by autoradiography using Biomax MR-1 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). To test formally for the presence of mitochondrial and peroxisomal targeting sequences inXenopus AGT, various Xenopus/human AGT andXenopus AGT/green fluorescent protein (GFP) constructs were made. By using pXlAGT(long) as template,Xenopus AGT cDNA was amplified by PCR using primer pairs P4/P10, P4/P11, and P3/P11 (Table I and Fig. 1). The products were digested with EcoRI and ApaI and ligated into previously digested pcDNA3 to make clones pXlAGT(short)-SKL, pXlAGT(short)-KKL, and pXlAGT(long)-KKL, respectively. A region of pXlAGT(long) was amplified by PCR using primers P3 and P5 (Table I and Fig. 1). The product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated into previously digested pEGFP (CLONTECH) to make pXlAGT(MTS)-GFP. To make pHsAGT-KKM, human AGT cDNA (8Takada Y. Kaneko N. Esumi H. Purdue P.E. Danpure C.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was amplified using the human-specific primer P6 and the mutagenic primer P12. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy and cut with ApaI and BamHI. The digested product was ligated back into the original human cDNA clone, replacing the original region. The whole insert was cut out of pBluescript with HindIII andBamHI and cloned into pcDNA3 to form clone pHsAGT-KKM. SV40-transformed monkey kidney cells (COS-1), grown on coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2, were transfected with various cDNA constructs using Superfect (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in freshly prepared 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. The cells were then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as described previously (12Oatey P.B. Lumb M.J. Danpure C.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 374-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using mono-specific rabbit anti-human AGT antiserum and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) or guinea pig anti-human catalase followed by biotinylated anti-guinea pig IgG and avidin Texas Red (Vector Laboratories). Sometimes the cells were stained with MitoTracker (Molecular Probes) before fixation. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides in Mowiol (Harlow Chemical Co.

As we have found previously in the case of the common frog (1Danpure C.J. Fryer P. Jennings P.R. Allsop J. Griffiths S. Cunningham A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 64: 295-313PubMed Google Scholar), AGT in amphibian livers appears to be both mitochondrial and cytosolic (Fig. 2). There was no evidence of any peroxisomal labeling. Insofar as these five species are representative of their phylum, amphibians appear to have a distribution of AGT that is distinct from that found in any mammal so far studied. Interestingly, the distribution of AGT in the only reptile to have been studied to date (i.e. the pond terrapin) shows it also to be mitochondrial and cytosolic. 2P. Fryer and C. J. Danpure, unpublished observations. The presence of mitochondrial, but not peroxisomal, AGT is compatible with the carnivorous diets (e.g. insects, slugs, worms etc.) of adult, if not larval, amphibians and suggests a gluconeogenic, rather than glyoxylate detoxification, role for the enzyme. The composite Xenopus AGT cDNA sequence (GenBankTMAJ278065) shown in Fig.3 contains an open reading frame that encodes a protein of 415 amino acids. Two in-frame potential translation initiation sites can be identified 24 codons apart. The polypeptide initiating at the more 3′-site is predicted to contain 391 amino acids (one less than found in the equivalent region in AGTs from mammalian sources) and is 66% identical and 75% similar to human AGT. The first 24 amino acids (from the more 5′-initiation site) contains basic, hydroxyl, and hydrophobic amino acids and is deficient in acidic amino acids, as is typical of MTSs. Almost no primary sequence identity between this putative MTS and the 22-residue MTS in AGT of mammals, such as marmoset, cat, and rat, could be discerned (Fig.4). On the other hand, the C-terminal region of Xenopus AGT is well conserved when compared with mammalian AGTs, except that the C-terminal tripeptide inXenopus AGT is KKM, compared with KKL, SQL, NKL, and HRL found in various mammalian AGTs (Fig. 4).Figure 4N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid alignments. The predicted N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences of Xenopus AGT are aligned with the homologous regions of various mammalian AGTs. The positions of the ancestral translation start sites 1 and 2 are shaded, and the initiating methionines are in bold and underlined. The C-terminal tripeptides are in bold. *, residues conserved in mammals if contained within the open reading frame. +, residues inXlAGT that are found in at least one mammalian AGT. Unlike the C terminus, which is very well conserved between species, the N-terminal leader sequence is very poorly conserved.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RNase protection analysis generated two fragments (Fig. 5), the 5′-ends of which mapped to ∼39 and ∼89 bp downstream of the 5′-end of pXlAGT(long). This indicates that theXenopus AGT gene encodes at least two different kinds of transcript, the longer including both of the putative translation initiation sites and the putative MTS in its open reading frame and the shorter excluding the more 5′-site and the MTS. Although the 5′-ends of the long and short transcripts determined by RNase protection and RACE do not coincide, the functional consequences as far as the nature of the polypeptides synthesized are the same. The subcellular localizations of the long and short forms ofXenopus AGT can be seen following their expression in COS cells. XlAGT(long) is targeted to mitochondria, whereas pXlAGT(short) remains cytosolic (Fig.6). Thus the dual mitochondrial and cytosolic distribution of AGT in the liver cells of Xenopus, and probably other amphibians, can be explained by alternative transcription initiation and the production of both long and short transcripts which encode polypeptides that either do or do not possess an MTS. The observation thatXlAGT(long) is mitochondrial andXlAGT(short) is cytosolic clearly shows the necessity of the N-terminal 24 amino acids for the mitochondrial targeting of Xenopus AGT. To test its sufficiency, a construct (pXlAGT(MTS)-GFP) was made in which this region was fused to the N terminus of GFP. GFP contains no targeting information and when expressed in COS cells remains cytosolic. However, when pXlAGT(MTS)-GFP was expressed it was localized to the mitochondria, although some diffuse labeling was also apparent (Fig. 7,A and B). This result strongly suggests that the N-terminal 24 amino acids of XlAGT(long) is its MTS, although other regions of the protein might also be involved in improving its efficiency. Unlike AGT in mammalian livers, there is no evidence that AGT is at all peroxisomal in amphibian livers. However, it is very difficult to provide definitive proof against the presence of a protein in an intracellular compartment. Peroxisomal targeting of mammalian AGTs is, at least in part, dependent on their C-terminal tripeptides that seem to function as rather atypical type 1 peroxisomal targeting sequences (PTS1s). In an attempt to gain further insights into whether Xenopus AGT has any potential for peroxisomal targeting, we have functionally characterized its C terminus further. Unlike the N-terminal 24 amino acid MTS ofXlAGT(long), the C terminus of XlAGT is very well conserved with 16 of the last 20 residues being found at the same position in the AGTs from at least one mammal (see Fig. 4). In all mammals studied so far, AGT is at least partly peroxisomal even though the tripeptides at the C termini are highly variable (i.e. KKL in human and marmoset (8Takada Y. Kaneko N. Esumi H.

In no cases are these better than a two out of three match to the consensus PTS1 of S/A/C-K/R/H-L/M (13Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J.

The C-terminal tripeptide ofXenopus AGT is KKM which is also a two out of three match and rather similar to the C terminus of human AGT. The nonperoxisomal distribution of both XlAGT(long) andXlAGT(short) clearly shows that KKM cannot direct the peroxisomal targeting of Xenopus AGT. To test whether it was able to target a mammalian AGT to peroxisomes, a construct was made in which the C-terminal KKL of human AGT was replaced by the"

In this work, downstream events associated with adhesion inhibition have been investigated. By using HUT78 T cell lines, CD4 ligands were shown to induce a dissociation of LFA-1 from cytohesin, a cytoplasmic protein known to bind LFA-1 and to enhance the affinity/avidity of LFA-1 for its ligand ICAM-1. A dissociation of PI3-kinase from cytohesin is also observed. In parallel, we have found that CD4 ligand binding induced a redistribution of PI3-kinase and of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 to the membrane and induced a transient formation of protein interactions including PI3-kinase; an adaptor protein, Gab2; SHP-2; and a SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase, SHIP. By using antisense oligonucleotides or transfection of transdominant mutants, down-regulation of adhesion was shown to require the Gab2/PI3-kinase association and the expression of SHIP and SHP-2. We therefore propose that CD4 ligands, by inducing these molecular associations, lead to sustained local high levels of D-3 phospholipids and possibly regulate the cytohesin/LFA-1 association.

Tolvanen M. Kotovuori P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 215-232Google Scholar). As shown in blocking experiments with specific monoclonal Abs and transfection experiments (2Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Google Scholar), these adhesion processes are required for T cell activation and effector functions. We have previously shown that the LFA-1-dependent adhesion between CD4+ T cells (resting or T cell lines) and B cells was down-regulated by CD4 ligands. This process requires the activities of the tyrosine kinase p56lck associated with CD4 (3Mazerolles F. Barbat C. Meloche S. Graton S. Soula M. Fagard R. Fischer S. Hivroz C. Bernier J. Sekaly R.P. Fischer A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5670-5679Google Scholar) and of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)1 associated with the CD4·p56lck complex (4Mazerolles F. Barbat C. Hivroz C. Fischer A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4844-4854Google Scholar). However, the molecular events and the relationship between these kinases required for the down-regulation induced by CD4 binding and the modification of the affinity/avidity of LFA-1 are not clearly understood. PI3-kinase is an intracellular enzyme mainly consisting of two subunits: the p110 catalytic subunit (α and β isoforms) and the p85 regulatory subunit (α and β isoforms) (5Escobedo J.A. Navankasattusas S. Kavanaugh W.M. Milfay D. Fried A.V. Williams L.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 75-82Google Scholar, 6Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayatou G. Ruiz-Larrea F. Thompson A. Totty N.F. Hsuan S.A. Courtneidge S. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 419-429Google Scholar). This enzyme phosphorylates the d-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI 4-P), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P2) (7Whitman M. Downes C.P. Keeler M. Keller T. Cantley L. Nature. 1988; 332: 644-646Google Scholar). These phospholipids are one of the intermediary messengers for the CD4-mediated down-regulation of LFA-1-dependent adhesion since inhibitors of PI3-kinase activity abrogate the regulatory event (8Mazerolles F. Barbat C. Fischer A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2457-2465Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PI3-kinase upon CD4 ligand binding mediates down-regulation of LFA-1 adhesion is unknown. PI3-kinase can exert an opposite effect: Kolanus et al. (9Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Google Scholar) have recently shown that thed-3 phospholipids synthesized by PI3-kinase increase the affinity of LFA-1 for its ligand ICAM-1 by a modification of association between the β2 cytoplasmic domain of LFA-1 and a cytoplasmic protein, cytohesin-1. Cytohesin-1 is a 47-kDa intracellular protein that interacts specifically with the cytoplasmic domain of the leukocyte integrin αLβ2. The overexpression of full-length cytohesin-1 resulted in a constitutive adhesion of αLβ2 (9Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Google Scholar), and PI3-kinase activates the β2 integrin adhesion pathway at least partially through cytohesin-1. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) could directly recruit cytohesin with its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and could contribute to the localization of this protein to the plasma membrane in close relationship with LFA-1 at cell interaction sites. Therefore PI3-kinase seems to play a complex role in regulating cell adhesion. However, the regulation of LFA-1 adhesion could also involve other signaling molecules. The precise role of tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases in adhesion complex formation remains unclear. A key mechanism could involve the binding of SH2 domains present in many signaling molecules and some tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoskeleton molecules. We have previously shown that inhibition of tyrosine kinases with herbimycin A neutralized the down-regulation of LFA-1 adhesion induced by CD4 ligands suggesting that tyrosine kinases are part of this regulatory pathway. Furthermore, p56lck and PI3-kinase (p110 catalytic subunit), which are involved in this mechanism, are transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated after CD4 binding with kinetics similar to that of the down-regulation of adhesion. The SH2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2) has been proposed to act as a negative regulator of T cell signaling based on its association with CTLA-4 (10Marengere L. Waterhouse P. Duncan G. Mittrucker H. Feng G. Mak T. Science. 1996; 272: 1170-1173Google Scholar). This intracellular phosphotyrosine phosphatase is characterized by the presence of tandem SH2 domains at its N terminus followed by a single catalytic domain and unique region (11Tonks N. Neel B. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-373Google Scholar). p56lck and PI3-kinase can be dephosphorylated by SHP-2 as suggested in B cells after BCR-FcγRIIβ coclustering (12Sarmay G. Koncz G. Pecht I. Gergely J. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 25-34Google Scholar). Another SH2 containing protein could be involved in the adhesion regulatory process induced by CD4 ligands, i.e.the SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP) that dephosphorylates the PIP3 at position 5, thereby linking its activity to PI3-kinase activity. SHIP is a cytosolic protein composed of a single SH2 domain at its N terminus, a catalytic domain, two phosphotyrosine binding domain consensus sequences, and several putative SH3-interacting motifs at the C terminus for interacting with many different proteins. (13Lioubin M. Algate P. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Acbersold A. Rohrschneider L. Genes Dev. 1996; 101084Google Scholar). A negative role for SHIP signaling has been described in B cells (14Chacko G.W. Tridandapani S. Damen J. Liu L. Krystal G. Coggeshall K. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2234-2238Google Scholar, 15Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that during FcγRIIβ1-mediated inhibition of B cell receptor signaling, SHIP recruits the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase (16Gupta N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7489-7494Google Scholar). A p85 SH2 domain recognition is present in SHIP. In addition, SHIP has been demonstrated to be a target for protein tyrosine kinase activated in response to multiple cytokines as well as TCR engagement (17Liu L. Damen J.E. Ware M. Hugues M. Krystal G. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 181-184Google Scholar). SHIP was also shown to be able to precipitate SHP-2 after cytokine stimulation (18Liu L. Damen J.E. Ware M.D. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10998-11001Google Scholar). PI3-kinase and SHP-2 have been also shown to associate to Gab2, a member of a subfamily of scaffolding adaptors that includesDrosophila Dos and mammalian Gab1 (19Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Shirogane T. Atsumi T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1809-1816Google Scholar, 20Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol.

These proteins have an N-terminal PH domain followed by multiple potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites and several proline-rich sequences. Initial characterization of Gab2 suggested that it functions in a variety of signaling pathways, including those emanating from receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors, and antigen receptors (20Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729Google Scholar, 22Wickrema A. Uddin S. Sharma A. Chen F. Alsayed Y. Ahmad S. Sawyer S.T. Krystal G. Yi T. Nishada K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24469-24474Google Scholar). It has been observed that Gab2, in response to stimulation by different cytokines, becomes rapidly tyrosyl-phosphorylated and associates to SHP-2 and PI3-kinase. Indeed Gab2 expresses three YXXM motifs that constitute potential sites for interaction with p85-PI3-kinase. Mutations in these motifs abrogate PI3-kinase binding (23Pratt J.C. Igras V.E. Maeda H. Baksh S. Gelfand E.W. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Gu H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4158-4163Google Scholar). Gab2, by association with SHP-2 or PI3-kinase, either plays a positive signaling role (19Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Shirogane T. Atsumi T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Ishihara K.

This negative signal requires Gab2/PI3-kinase but not Gab2/SHP-2 interaction (23Pratt J.C. Igras V.E. Maeda H. Baksh S. Gelfand E.W. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Gu H. J.

Potential interactions between PI3-kinase and LFA-1/cytohesin and the formation of protein association, including SHP-2, SHIP, or Gab2, induced by CD4 binding were therefore investigated. The following Abs were used: 13B8.2 and 25.3 (IgG1; anti-CD4 and anti-LFA-1α monoclonal Abs, respectively; Immunotech, Marseille, France), anti-SHP-2 Ab (Transduction Laboratories), anti-SHIP Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TEBU S.A., Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France), and anti-p85-PI3-kinase polyclonal Ab and anti-Gab2 polyclonal Ab (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-cytohesin polyclonal Ab was a kind gift of Dr. W.

The DR134–148 peptide (NGQEEKAGVVSTGLI) is analogous to residues 134–148 of the HLA class II β2 domain, and the control peptide V15A (VQKSIENVTGLGEGA) is a random sequence analogous to DR134–148 (24Cammarota G.

All were synthesized by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France) and Genosphere Biotechnologies (Paris, France) according to the solid-phase synthesis method FMOC and further purified by means of HPLC, resulting in >96% purity as shown by HPLC analysis. Peptide sequences were validated by amino acid analysis of the purified preparations. The specific inhibitor of PI3-kinase, Ly294002 (27Vlahos C. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol.

The Gab2 construct (Gab2-3YF, 3Y>F mutation of the three YXXM motifs), unable to bind p85-PI3-kinase used in these studies, was generated by PCR and subcloned into the pEBB vector developed by Gu et al. (20Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729Google Scholar). The SHP-2 constructs used in these studies (SHP-2wt and SHP-2C/S, the catalytically inactive Cys to Ser mutant form) were built with the pRC/CMV vector developed by Zhao et al. (28Zhao R. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5453-5459Google Scholar). The HUT78 T cell line (CD4−, LFA-1+, CD2−) was obtained as described previously (3Mazerolles F. Barbat C. Meloche S. Graton S. Soula M. Fagard R. Fischer S. Hivroz C. Bernier J. Sekaly R.P. Fischer A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5670-5679Google Scholar). HUT78-CD4− was infected with the wild type CD4 cDNAs. The transfected cells expressed CD4 normally as shown in a previous report (3Mazerolles F. Barbat C. Meloche S. Graton S. Soula M. Fagard R. Fischer S. Hivroz C. Bernier J. Sekaly R.P. Fischer A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5670-5679Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The HUT78-CD4+ T cell line (107) were also preincubated for 2 h in OPTIFECT medium (Bio Media, Boussens, France) and then transfected with the indicated plasmids in combination with 10 μg of green fluorescent protein at 260 V/1200 microfarads using a Bio-Rad electroporator. The transfected cells were grown for 20 h and then washed, and the green fluorescent protein-positive T cells (25–30%) were tested in adhesion assay with B cell lines preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C with hydroethidine (40 μg/ml; Polysciences, Warrington, PA). No modification of CD4 expression was observed after the different transfections (data not shown). SenseS-oligonucleotides were synthesized to nucleotides 1–21 of the human SHIP mRNA (5′-TGT CAG CAC GGC CGC AGA AGA-3′) and to nucleotides 1–18 of the human SHP-2 mRNA (29Walter A.O. Peng Z.Y. Cartwright C.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1911-1920Google Scholar) (5′-ATG ACA TCG CGG AGA TGG-3′) (Genset, La Jolla, CA). The antisenseS-oligonucleotides were synthesized to the complementary strand (antisense SHIP, 5′-TCT TCT GCG GCC GTG CTG ACA-3′; antisense SHP-2, 5′-CCA TCT CCG CGA TGT CAT-3′). Cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 15 μm antisense and sense oligonucleotides in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After this incubation, cells were washed and tested in adhesion assays. No modification of CD4 expression was observed after incubation with the different oligonucleotides (data not shown). The adhesion assay or conjugate formation between T and B cells was performed as described previously (30Mazerolles F. Lumbroso C. Lecomte O. Le Deist F. Fischer A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 1229-1233Google Scholar). The HUT 78-CD4+ T cell line was incubated with hydroethidine (40 μg/ml; Polysciences) for 20 min at 37 °C, and B cells were incubated with sulfate fluorescein diacetate (100 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 37 °C. After washing, 3 × 105 T cells were preincubated during for the time indicated with 3 × 105 B cells at 37 °C. After this incubation, cells were cooled at 4 °C to block attachment and detachment. Before counting to maintain preformed conjugates, incubation at 4 °C was followed by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min, and cells were gently resuspended in 50 μl of RPMI 1640 medium. Conjugates were identified as red/green pairs of cells under a fluorescence microscope. Two hundred to 350 fluorescent cells were counted blindly in each experiment. Results are expressed as the percentage of T-B conjugates among all T cells. HUT78 T cell lines (20 × 106) were washed in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) and incubated for different times with soluble CD4 ligands without cross-linking. They were then pelleted, washed in RPMI 1640 medium, and lysed for 20 min on ice in lysis buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 140 mmNaCl; 50 mm NaF; 1 mmNa3VO4; 1% Nonidet P-40; antipain, pepstatin, and leupeptin (each at 2 μg/ml); 2 μg/ml aprotinin; and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For immunoprecipitation with anti-LFA-1 Ab or anti-cytohesin Ab, T cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 8.2; 150 mm NaCl; 100 μmNa3VO4; 1% Brij 96; antipain, pepstatin, and leupeptin (each at 1 μg/ml); 100 μg/ml aprotinin; 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 5 mm iodoacetamide; and 2 mm MgCl2. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The protein concentration was determined in postnuclear supernatants using the Bio-Rad kit with bovine serum albumin as standard. The same amount of each postnuclear lysate was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 3 μg of rabbit, rat, or mouse immunoglobulins and recovered by incubation with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for 45 min at 4 °C. Then the supernatant was incubated for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C with the specific antibodies: anti-p85-PI3-kinase (1:2000), anti-LFA-1α or -β (1:60), anti-cytohesin-1 (1:40), anti-SHIP (5 μg/ml), anti-SHP-2 (1 μg/ml), or anti-Gab2 (1 μg/ml). Immunoprecipitates were recovered by incubation with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads for 45 min at 4 °C and washed three times in lysis buffer (A or B) prior to dissociation in reduced Laemmli sample buffer before resolution by 7% SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitates were electrophoretically transferred for 2 h at 150 V to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and blots were hybridized with the different antibodies. Proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL+; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) with an anti-rabbit, anti-rat, or anti-mouse Ig coupled to horseradish peroxidase as secondary Ab (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Experiments have been quantified by densitometric scanning. Immunoprecipitations were performed on extracts from control or cells incubated with CD4 ligands as described above. Proteins were released by boiling the immune complexes in 1% SDS. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was diluted to 0.1% using immunoprecipitation buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Secondary immunoprecipitations were performed using the specific antibody as described above. 8 × 105 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, cytospun onto slides for 8 min at 800 rpm, and then fixed and permeabilized for 5 min in ethanol. Subsequently cells were incubated with first antibody for 30 min at room temperature, washed 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at room temperature in darkness. After the final wash with phosphate-buffered saline, slides were mounted on a 9:1 mixture of glycerol and 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0 containing n-propyl-gallate at 20 mg/ml as antifading reagent. Then samples were examined on a confocal laser scanning apparatus (LSM 510, Zeiss). It has been previously shown by Kolanus et al.(9Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Google Scholar) that LFA-1 in its active form is associated to an intracytoplasmic protein, cytohesin-1, expressing a PH domain to which thed-3 phospholipids synthesized by PI3-kinase could bind. Cytohesin-1 is thought to up-regulate LFA-1 avidity to its ligand ICAM-1. As the HLA-DR β-related 134–148 peptide as well as anti-CD4 Ab can inhibit LFA-1-mediated CD4+ T cell adhesion, we have tested whether the CD4-dependent down-regulation of LFA-1-mediated HUT78 T cell line adhesion was dependent upon cytohesin-1/LFA-1 association/dissociation. Following incubation with DR134–148 peptide, a dissociation of cytohesin-1 from LFA-1 was indeed observed (Fig.1A, lane 2). We have also investigated a hypothetic interaction between cytohesin-1 and PI3-kinase that could account for a local increase of d-3 phospholipids necessary to modify the β2integrin-dependent adhesion. As shown in Fig.1B, an association between PI3-kinase and cytohesin is observed in the absence of CD4 ligand binding, while DR134–148 rapidly induced a rapid partial dissociation of PI3-kinase from cytohesin-1. Activity of CD4-associated PI3-kinase (4Mazerolles F. Barbat C. Hivroz C. Fischer A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4844-4854Google Scholar) could regulate the association between cytohesin-1 and LFA-1. We have tested this hypothesis by preincubating cells with a PI3-kinase activity inhibitor (Ly294002). As shown in Fig. 1A, the dissociation of LFA-1 from cytohesin-1 observed following cell incubation with DR134–148 (Fig. 1A, lane 2) was no longer detected when cells were preincubated with Ly294002 (lane 5). In contrast, the DR134–148 peptide induced an increased association between both proteins in the presence of Ly294002. Similarly, as shown in Fig.1C, Ly294002 preincubation inhibited the dissociation of cytohesin-1 from PI3-kinase observed after DR134–148 incubation (lane 4). We have previously observed that the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3-kinase was transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated following CD4 binding, suggesting the involvement of a tyrosine phosphatase. We have therefore investigated whether an interaction between PI3-kinase and the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, as described in another setting, is induced (12Sarmay G. Koncz G. Pecht I. Gergely J. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 25-34Google Scholar). In Fig.2A, it is shown that DR134–148 can indeed trigger a transient association between SHP-2 and PI3-kinase that was maximal after a 10-min incubation and decreased thereafter. The same blot revealed with an anti-SHP-2 Ab showed that this increase was not related to an increase in SHP-2 immunoprecipitation since the same amount of SHP-2 was detected in each lane. No increase was detected with the control peptide V15A (data not shown). Sequential immunoprecipitation with an anti-SHP-2 Ab followed by an anti-PI3-kinase Ab also showed an increase in association following incubation with soluble anti-CD4 Ab (Fig.2B). No increase was detected by using an anti-LFA-1 Ab as a control (Fig. 2B). Similar results were observed by using the DR134–148 peptide (data not shown). Analysis by immunofluorescence imaging showed that p85-PI3-kinase and SHP-2 were cytoplasmic in unstimulated cells (Fig.3, A and B) after incubation with an anti-LFA-1 Ab (Fig. 3, C andD) or with the control peptide V15A (Fig. 3, Eand F). After incubation with anti-CD4 Ab (Fig. 3,G and H) or with DR134–148 peptide (Fig. 3,I and J), a translocation of p85-PI3-kinase and SHP-2 from cytosol to membrane was observed. No association was detected between goat anti-mouse Ig-tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate and anti-LFA-1 Ab or anti-CD4 Ab used for stimulation (data not shown). It has been reported that SHIP can associate to PI3-kinase and SHP-2 and regulate the level of PIP3synthesized by PI3-kinase (13Lioubin M. Algate P. Tsai S. Carlberg K. Acbersold A. Rohrschneider L. Genes Dev. 1996; 101084Google Scholar). We have therefore investigated a hypothetic interaction between SHIP and PI3-kinase following incubation with DR134–148 peptide. PI3-kinase was detected after a sequential immunoprecipitation with an anti-PI3-kinase Ab followed by an anti-SHIP Ab (Fig. 4A). This interaction was transient and peaked after a 5-min incubation. A similar increase was observed after incubation with an anti-CD4 Ab (data not shown). SHP-2 was also detected in association with SHIP after sequential immunoprecipitation with anti-SHP-2 Ab followed by anti-SHIP Ab. A transient increase in this association was induced by anti-CD4 Ab (Fig.4B) or by DR134–148 peptide (data not shown). Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments following DR134–148 incubation did not lead to the detection of a ternary complex between PI3-kinase, SHIP, and SHP-2, suggesting that associations were mutually exclusive (data not shown). PI3-kinase and SHP-2 could also associate to adaptor proteins such as Gab2 known to be able to exert inhibitory activities (23Pratt J.C. Igras V.E. Maeda H. Baksh S. Gelfand E.W. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Gu H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4158-4163Google Scholar). We have investigated whether an association to Gab2 was detectable during events associated with the negative signaling induced by CD4 ligands. It was indeed observed that a soluble anti-CD4 Ab induced a transient association between Gab2 and PI3-kinase (Fig.5A). This transient interaction was maximal following a 30-s incubation with anti-CD4 Ab and decreased rapidly thereafter. No association was detected between Gab2 and SHP-2 (Fig. 5B). In contrast, in parallel to Gab2/PI3-kinase association, a transient association was induced between Gab2 and SHIP following incubation with anti-CD4 Ab (Fig.5C). The role of SHP-2, SHIP, and Gab2 in the down-regulation of LFA-1-mediated adhesion was investigated. For this purpose, the kinetics of adhesion of HUT78-CD4+ T cells preincubated with relevant antisense oligonucleotides or of HUT78-CD4+ T cells transfected with negative transdominant cDNAs were determined. By using antisense oligonucleotides to the SHP-2 protein encoding RNA, we found that, when expression of SHP-2 was reduced (as shown in Blot anti-SHP-2 of Fig.6A, top), down-regulation of adhesion was neutralized (Fig. 6A). In contrast, kinetics of adhesion was not altered when cells were treated with the control sense oligonucleotide. The role of SHIP in the down-regulation of LFA-1-mediated T cell adhesion was similarly analyzed by using sense or antisense oligonucleotides directed against SHIP mRNA. While the anti-SHIP immunoblot (Fig. 6B,top) showed a reduced expression of SHIP following antisense incubation, down-regulation of LFA-1-mediated adhesion was no longer detectable (Fig. 6B). In contrast, kinetics of adhesion was not modified when cells were treated with the control sense oligonucleotide (Fig. 6B). It was verified that incubation with the SHP-2 or SHIP antisense oligonucleotides did not modify CD4 surface expression (data not shown). The role of the association between PI3-kinase and Gab2 was investigated by transfecting a mutated form of Gab2 (Gab2-3Y>F) that is unable to bind PI3-kinase. After transfection of HUT78-CD4+ T cells with this mutated form of Gab2, adhesion to HLA class II+ B cells was significantly modified in contrast to T cell lines transfected with wild type Gab2 (Fig. 6C). The role of SHP-2 activity in the down-regulation of adhesion was also analyzed following transfection with a catalytically inactive SHP-2 protein (SHP-2C/S). Kinetics of adhesion between transfected SHP-2C/S-HUT78-CD4+ T cells and HLA class II+ B cells was found unchanged as compared with the control (Fig.6D). We have previously shown that CD4 ligands and especially the HLA-DR β-related 134–148 sequence (DR134–148 peptide) inhibits LFA-1-dependent adhesion (3Mazerolles F. Barbat C. Meloche S. Graton S. Soula M. Fagard R. Fischer S. Hivroz C. Bernier J. Sekaly R.P. Fischer A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5670-5679Google Scholar). This negative signal requires the activities of the tyrosine kinase p56lck and the lipid kinase PI3-kinase. To account for the role of PI3-kinase on LFA-1-dependent adhesion, we have investigated whether CD4-dependent PI3-kinase activation could modify molecular associations potentially required in mediating LFA-1-dependent adhesion. Kolanus et al. (9Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Google Scholar) have demonstrated that a cytosolic protein, cytohesin-1, by associating to LFA-1 up-regulates the LFA-1-dependent adhesion in modifying the affinity of LFA-1 for its ligand ICAM-1. We herein show that DR134–148 induces a partial dissociation of LFA-1 from cytohesin in HUT78 T cells, an effect that is PI3-kinase-dependent. The kinetics of dissociation induced by DR134–148 correlates well to the kinetics of deadhesion between CD4+ T cells and HLA class II+ B cells we have previously reported (31Mazerolles F. Amblard F. Lumbroso C. Lecomte O. Van De Moortele P. Barbat C. Piatier-Tonneau D. Auffray C. Fischer A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 637-644Google Scholar). In parallel to CD4/PI3-kinase down-regulation of LFA-1/cytohesin-1 association, a translocation of PI3-kinase from the cytosol to the membrane and a partial dissociation of PI3-kinase from cytohesin-1 occur. These results fit the model proposed by Kolanus et al. (9Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Google Scholar) in which cytohesin association to LFA-1 correlates with up-regulation of LFA-1-mediated adhesion. PI3-kinase thus appears to be involved in both positive and negative events regulating LFA-1/cytohesin-1 association. On one hand, PI3-kinase activation leads to an increase in d-3 phospholipids enabling anchoring of cytohesin by its PH domain to the membrane in close vicinity to LFA-1 (32Nagel W. Zeitlmann L. Schilcher P. Geiger C. Kolanus J. Kolanus W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14853-14861Google Scholar). On the other hand, CD4-dependent activation and recruitment of PI3-kinase have the opposite effect. These results strongly suggest that PI3-kinase in the latter case is recruited to a different compartment to which cytohesin is excluded. This hypothesis is consistent with the finding of CD4-mediated PI3-kinase dissociation from cytohesin but remains to be directly tested. Krauss et al. (33Krauss K. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36921-36927Google Scholar) have shown that LFA-1-mediated binding of T cells to ICAM-1 is rapidly induced by clustering of membrane lipid rafts as a function of PI3-kinase activation. Krauss et al. (33Krauss K. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36921-36927Google Scholar) suggest that rafts preformed adhesion platforms, which would be important for the rapid regulation of lymphocyte adhesion. Krauss et al. (33Krauss K. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36921-36927Google Scholar) have also implied a close association of the cytohesin-1 system with raft cluster formation. We therefore suggest that CD4 ligand binding induces a delocalization of PI3-kinase from rafts containing cytohesin. It is also possible that CD4 ligand binding induces the recruitment of cytoskeleton proteins or phosphatases in rafts and thereby modifies the integrin activity. Cytoskeleton reorganization is also related to the formation of rafts (34Moran M. Polakis P. McCormick F. Pawson T. Ellis C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 111804Google Scholar). This hypothesis is presently under investigation. Another possibility would be that separate PI3-kinase compartments play distinct roles in cell adhesion regulation (35Constantin G. Majeed M. Giagulli C. Piccio L. Kim J.Y. Butcher E.C. Laudanna C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 759-769Google Scholar). In previous studies, we have also observed that DR134–148 induces a transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of p56lck and p110 subunit of PI3-kinase (36Mazerolles F. Fischer A. Int. Immunol. 1998; 10: 1897-1905Google Scholar). This suggests that tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases could also be involved in the negative signal induced by CD4 ligands. The adhesion down-regulation induced by CD4 ligands was found neutralized by a preincubation with an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity (3Mazerolles F. Barbat C. Meloche S. Graton S. Soula M. Fagard R. Fischer S. Hivroz C. Bernier J. Sekaly R.P. Fischer A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5670-5679Google Scholar). Furthermore, several groups (37Gesbert F. Guenzi C. Bertoglio J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18273-18281Google Scholar, 38Craddock B.L. Welham M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29281-29289Google Scholar) have described interaction between PI3-kinase and the SH2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase family. We have therefore investigated whether the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 could associate to PI3-kinase and whether CD4 ligands were able to modify this interaction. It has been shown that CD4 ligands induce a transient increase in SHP-2 and PI3-kinase association. After CD4 triggering, a translocation of PI3-kinase and SHP-2 from the cytoplasm to the membrane is concomitantly observed. The SHP-2 expression was found necessary to observe a down-regulation of LFA-1-dependent adhesion induced by CD4, whereas SHP-2 activity is dispensable as shown by transfection experiments with T cells transfected with a catalytically inactive SHP-2 (SHP-2C/S). Xuet al. (39Xu F. Zhao R. Peng Y. Guerrah A. Zhao Z.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29479-29484Google Scholar) have recently suggested that the catalytic domain is responsible for the localization of SHP-2 in different membrane compartments, although the SHP-2 activity was not required. SHP-2 could thus be required as an adaptor protein to associate PI3-kinase with other proteins independently of its catalytic activity in mediating inhibition of LFA-1-mediated adhesion. SHIP down-regulates PI3-kinase activity by hydrolyzing thed-3 phospholipids synthesized by PI3-kinase (40Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Google Scholar) and thus could be involved in the down-regulation of LFA-1-dependent adhesion. In addition, SHIP can bind SHP-2 (15Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Google Scholar), and the role of SHIP in regulating LFA-1-dependent adhesion has been recently described in a murine myeloid cell line (41Rey-Ladino J.A. Huber M. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. Takei F. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5792-5799Google Scholar). The role of SHIP has thus been investigated, and a rapid transient association was detected between PI3-kinase and SHIP after CD4 binding. This association could favor the conversion of PI 3,4,5-P3 to PI 3,4-P2 by SHIP. This conversion could thus be important in signaling for the membrane localization or turnover of PH domain-containing proteins such as cytohesin. A role for SHIP in the down-regulation of T cell adhesion induced by CD4 was found as down-regulation was neutralized in the absence of SHIP expression. SHIP is also a substrate of SHP-2 and plays a major role as a negative regulator of intracellular signal transduction (15Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Google Scholar), while its localization appears to be the determining factor in its mechanism of action (12Sarmay G. Koncz G. Pecht I. Gergely J. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 68: 25-34Google Scholar). SHP-2 was described as one of the proteins able to attract SHIP to the membrane close to lipid substrates. In parallel to PI3-kinase/SHIP association, an interaction between SHIP and SHP-2 has been shown, and a colocalization of both proteins, close to the membrane, has been found to be triggered by CD4 ligands. 2F. Mazerolles, unpublished data. One can therefore propose that SHIP binds to both SHP-2 and PI3-kinase in this setting. However, we did not succeed in detecting an association of these three proteins together. This association might be transient, or alternatively the association between SHIP and SHP-2 could be exclusive of SHIP-PI3-kinase. It is also possible that distinct pools of SHIP are involved, one associated to PI3-kinase and another to SHP-2. The adaptor protein Gab2 was also found to interact with PI3-kinase after CD4 ligand binding and prior to PI3-kinase/SHP-2 association. SHP-2 was not found associated to Gab2, suggesting that PI3-kinase was either sequentially associated to Gab2 and SHP-2 or that these associations were distributed in different compartments. The fact that the Gab2·PI3-kinase complex was detected and not Gab2/SHP-2 after CD4 binding suggests that the negative signaling is similar to the one regulating TCR signaling described recently by Gu et al.(23Pratt J.C. Igras V.E. Maeda H. Baksh S. Gelfand E.W. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Gu H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4158-4163Google Scholar). Indeed, Gu et al. (23Pratt J.C. Igras V.E. Maeda H. Baksh S. Gelfand E.W. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Gu H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4158-4163Google Scholar) show that Gab2 inhibits TCR activation in Jurkat cell, and this Gab2-mediated inhibition requires an interaction with PI3-kinase but not with SHP-2. In the absence of Gab2/PI3-kinase association, down-regulation of adhesion was not observed. Gab2 has a PH domain that is required for TCR signal inhibition (20Gu H. Pratt J.C. Burakoff S.J. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 729Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the Gab2 PH domain binding to PIP3 localizes the Gab2·PI3-kinase complex to a specific subcellular site where Gab2 can exert its inhibitory effect. Gab2 could also mediate indirectly an association between PI3-kinase and SHP-2 with another protein. We have indeed observed that CD4 binding induces a transient association of Gab2 with SHIP in parallel to the transient association of Gab2 with PI3-kinase. Gab2 could thus bring together PI3-kinase and SHP-2 by the intermediary SHIP. In summary, we have shown that CD4 ligand binding, which induces a down-regulation of LFA-1-mediated adhesion in a T cell line, in parallel induces a dissociation of LFA-1 and PI3-kinase from cytohesin. In addition, a transient association of PI3-kinase with SHP-2, Gab2, and SHIP was observed. SHP-2, SHIP, and the Gab2/PI3-kinase association have also been described as important events in the negative regulation of lymphocyte signaling. These differential sequential associations could be required to maintain a stability in the level of PI 3,4-P2/PI 3,4,5-P3 involved in the regulation of LFA-1-dependent adhesion between T and B cells as proposed in the model pictured in Fig. 7. These association/dissociation events induced by CD4 ligand binding could also reflect distinct membrane compartmentalization of these proteins in raft domains and be associated to the negative signaling induced by CD4 by regulating cytohesin association to LFA-1.

https://openalex.org/W2159648646,"The highly conserved topological structure of G protein-activated adenylyl cyclases seems unnecessary because the soluble cytoplasmic domains retain regulatory and catalytic properties. Yet, we previously isolated a constitutively active mutant of theDictyostelium discoideum adenylyl cyclase harboring a single point mutation in the region linking the cytoplasmic and membrane domains (Leu-394). We show here that multiple amino acid substitutions at Leu-394 also display constitutive activity. The constitutive activity of these mutants is not dependent on G proteins or cytosolic regulators, although some of the mutants can be activated to higher levels than wild type. Combining a constitutive mutation such as L394T with K482N, a point mutation that renders the enzyme insensitive to regulators, restores an enzyme with wild type properties of low basal activity and the capacity to be activated by G proteins. Thus regions located outside the cytoplasmic loops of adenylyl cyclases are not only important in the acquisition of an activated conformation, they also have impact on other regions within the catalytic core of the enzyme.

Thus regions located outside the cytoplasmic loops of adenylyl cyclases are not only important in the acquisition of an activated conformation, they also have impact on other regions within the catalytic core of the enzyme. adenylyl cyclase expressed during aggregation cytosolic regulator of adenylyl cyclase guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate G protein-coupled adenylyl cyclases are responsible for the synthesis of the ubiquitous second messenger cAMP. In eukaryotic cells, cAMP regulates a multitude of cellular responses, including cell growth and differentiation, metabolism, and synaptic transmission (1Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Google Scholar, 2Simonds W.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 66-73Google Scholar). Modulation of adenylyl cyclase activity is thus responsible for a wide variety of biological and pathological states. Hormones, neurotransmitters, odorants, and chemokines control this activity by interacting with G protein-coupled receptors. These activated receptors stimulate the exchange of GDP for GTP on the α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G proteins, and the α-subunit dissociates from the βγ complex. Both the activated Gα-subunit and the released Gβγ complex can stimulate or inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity. In mammalian cells, at least nine different forms of this enzyme have been cloned, and each subtype has been shown to possess a specific pattern of regulation and expression. Although these adenylyl cyclases are all activated by Gsα, they show a distinct response to Giα- and Gβγ-subunits, Ca2+, Ca2+/calmodulin, as well as protein kinase A and C. InDrosophila, a large family of these enzymes has also been identified (3Cann M.J. Levin L.R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 121-135Google Scholar). One enzyme has been shown to be involved in learning and memory (4Levin L.R. Han P.L. Hwang P.M. Feinstein P.G. Davis R.L. Reed R.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 479-489Google Scholar). In the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum, the expression of a single G protein-coupled adenylyl cyclase, named ACA,1 is essential for the survival of this lower eukaryote (5Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J.A. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Google Scholar).Adenylyl cyclases share a common topology predicted to consist of two sets of six transmembrane helices and two large cytoplasmic domains (C1 and C2) located C-terminally to each set of helices (2Simonds W.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 66-73Google Scholar). Each cytoplasmic domain contains a region of homology (designated C1a and C2a) with the cytoplasmic domains of several adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases. The interaction between the two cytoplasmic domains of adenylyl cyclases is necessary for the activation of the enzyme; the catalytic and G protein-mediated activities are retained by separately purifying and mixing the two cytoplasmic domains (6Tang W.J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1995; 268: 1769-1772Google Scholar). The availability of such a soluble form of adenylyl cyclases has allowed the completion of crystallographic studies (7Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoha A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Google Scholar, 8Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Google Scholar). These studies revealed that the C1/C2 catalytic core is a symmetric heterodimer that binds one molecule of Gsα, one molecule of forskolin (a hypotensive drug that stimulates all mammalian forms, except type IX), and one molecule of ATP. The active site of the enzyme is located at the C1/C2 interface. It has been proposed that G proteins regulate the activity of the enzyme by inducing a conformational change that reorients the C1 and C2 domains.In D. discoideum, the proper regulation of the G protein-coupled adenylyl cyclase ACA is essential for the early stages of development during which starvation induces cells to aggregate and differentiate into spores atop a stalk of vacuolated cells (9Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 411-440Google Scholar). In this system, cAMP acts like a hormone; after its synthesis, it is secreted and it binds to specific G protein-coupled receptors called cARs (cAMP receptors). Receptor occupancy leads to the activation of several effectors including ACA, and the signal is thereby relayed to neighboring cells. Genetic analysis revealed that receptor-mediated activation of ACA requires, in addition to heterotrimeric G proteins, several cytoplasmic regulators. Among them, CRAC (cytosolicregulator of adenylyl cyclase), a novel soluble protein containing a pleckstrin homology domain, is recruited to the plasma membrane in response to receptor activation and is absolutely required for receptor and GTPγS activation of ACA (10Lilly P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1659-1665Google Scholar). Consequently, crac− cells cannot activate ACA, do not aggregate, and remain as smooth monolayers when starved (11Insall R. Kuspa A. Lilly P.J. Shaulsky G. Levin L.R. Loomis W.F. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1537-1545Google Scholar). By using random mutagenesis and phenotypic rescue ofcrac− cells, we previously isolated a mutant of ACA displaying constitutive activity that required neither receptor activation nor cytoplasmic regulators (12Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18333-18336Google Scholar). This mutant harbored a single point mutation, Leu-394, located N-terminally to the first cytoplasmic domain just after the first hydrophobic cluster. To determine whether this domain is involved in the formation of an activated conformation of ACA, we mutagenized the amino acid sequence in that region and assessed the consequence of these alterations on the developmental and biochemical phenotypes of D. discoideum aca− and crac− cells expressing the mutants.RESULTSBy using site-directed mutagenesis, we replaced Leu-394 with 11 amino acids: 5 non-polar (Ala, Phe, Gly, Ile, and Pro); 3 polar (Asn, Thr, and Tyr); 2 acidic (Asp and Glu); and 1 basic (Arg). These constructs were cloned into an episomal plasmid, downstream of the actin-15 promoter that gives high constitutive levels of expression, and transformed in both aca− andcrac− cells. The developmental phenotype of these cell lines on non-nutrient agar is shown in Fig.1A. All substitutions at Leu-394 gave rise to ACA molecules that could complement theaca− cells, and many of the mutants suppressed the aggregation-deficient phenotype of thecrac− cells. In addition to the original L394S mutation, L394A, L394I, L394G, L394R, and L394T could all aggregate in the absence of the essential cytoplasmic regulator CRAC. One mutant, L394N, differentiated into weak aggregates and was thus scored as a partial suppressor. Western analysis revealed that each mutant expressed similar levels of ACA in both cell lines, although L394P expressed significantly lower levels of protein and was not further analyzed (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these observations suggested that many of the substitutions rendered the enzyme constitutively active.We next evaluated the intrinsic adenylyl cyclase activity of each mutant by measuring the enzyme activity in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 2A). Mn2+, a more potent cofactor than Mg2+, will stimulate the enzymatic activity in the absence of G proteins (18Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 713-719Google Scholar). It is thus used to assess the integrity of the catalytic core. As expected, all mutants expressed in either aca−or crac− cells showed high enzyme activities in the presence of Mn2+ (results are shown for the mutants expressed in crac− cells only). However, their activities, measured in the presence of Mg2+, varied greatly. For a number of mutants, the activity in the absence of Mn2+ was close to their activity in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 2B). By comparing the Mg2+/Mn2+ adenylyl cyclase activity ratio of the mutants with their developmental phenotype, we observed that a certain level of adenylyl cyclase activity suppressed the aggregation-deficient phenotype of the crac−cells. A substitution leading to a ratio of 0.5 or greater (corresponding to an activity of ∼50 pmol/min/mg) was sufficient. The glycine mutant defined the boundary between the two classes of mutants. These data show that single point mutations on adenylyl cyclases give rise to enzymes possessing distinct intrinsic activities.Figure 2Adenylyl cyclase activation of Leu-394-substituted ACA mutants expressed incrac− cells.A, basal and MnSO4-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity.

Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18333-18336Google Scholar). It displayed no significant activation in response to either receptor or GTPγS stimulation incrac− cells, and the same high basal activity was observed in membranes derived from L394S/gβ− cells, confirming that the mutant was not supersensitive to G proteins or cytosolic regulators. The new mutants showed a similar behavior. As expected, when expressed incrac− cells, none showed a response to GTPγS (data not shown). Next, we transformed three representative mutants ingβ− cells and measured the adenylyl cyclase activity in both lysates and membrane preparations. The three mutants retained high basal activity in the absence of functional G proteins (Fig. 3). Moreover, the high activity was measured in both cell lysates and membrane preparations. Interestingly, for both control and mutant enzymes, the Mg2+/Mn2+ activity ratio was further elevated in membrane preparations compared with cell lysates (Fig. 3). We also observed that many of the constitutively active mutants possessed a residual activation potential because they could be further activated when expressed in aca− cells. In this parental background, where wild type levels of G proteins and CRAC are expressed, the mutants showed a 2–3-fold stimulation in response to GTPγS (Fig. 4). This behavior was also observed with the original L394S mutant. Intriguingly, L394I showed the weakest stimulation in the presence of GTPγS (Fig. 4).Figure 3Adenylyl cyclase activity of Leu-394 substituted ACA mutants expressed ingβ− cells.

We generated three mutants that harbored the following alteration in the ACA protein: two mutants were designed to have three alanine insertions either N-terminal (AAAL) or C-terminal (LAAA) from the Leu-394 residue, and one had a 7-amino acid deletion (Del) across the Leu-394 residue, three residues on either side of the leucine along with the Leu-394 residue. Each construct was transformed in bothaca− and crac− cells. Fig. 5A shows that each mutant expressed the mutated ACA protein in both cell lines, although the mutants regularly showed lower expression compared with their wild type counterpart. Phenotypic analysis revealed that none of these substitutions suppressed the aggregation-deficient phenotype of thecrac− cells, suggesting that they did not display constitutive activity (Fig. 5A). When expressed in the aca− background, we observed that the Del mutant acquired a severely impaired conformation. Indeed, although both the AAAL and LAAA mutants could complement theaca− cells, the Del/aca− cell lines remained aggregation-deficient when plated on non-nutrient agar (Fig.5A). These results suggest that this mutation has a deleterious effect on G protein-mediated activation of ACA. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5B, the Del/aca−showed only a weak response to GTPγS. It thus appears that the N-terminal domain of the C1 loop of adenylyl cyclases is critical for the acquisition of an activated conformation.Figure 5Adenylyl cyclase activity of wild type, alanine insertional, and deletion ACA mutants.A, ACA protein expression and developmental phenotypes of the mutants when expressed in aca− andcrac− cells.

In a previous screen designed to isolate loss-of-function mutants of ACA, we identified several mutants that remained aggregation-deficient when expressed inaca− cells. These mutants displayed normal Mg2+/Mn2+ adenylyl cyclase activity ratios but showed no response to GTPγS stimulation and were unable to enter development when plated on non-nutrient agar (16Parent C.A. Deveotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22693-22696Google Scholar). One of these uncoupled mutants harbored a single point mutation (K482N) in the C1 loop of ACA. We introduced the L394T substitution, the strongest constitutive mutant, in the K482N background to construct the double mutant. The double mutant was electroporated inaca− cells, and the developmental phenotype of the resulting transformants was assessed. Western analysis revealed that the L394T,K482N/aca−, and the Leu-394/aca− cells expressed similar levels of ACA (data not shown). Under normal plating conditions, the mutant cells did not rescue the aggregation-deficient phenotype of theaca− cells. However, when plated at higher density, the L394T,K482N/aca− cells did enter development to form small mounds and fruiting bodies, a result never observed with aca− or K482N/aca− cells (Fig.6A). The presence of K482N altered the basal activity of the L394T mutation. Under our standard measurement conditions, L394T,K482N displayed a Mg2+/Mn2+ adenylyl cyclase activity ratio of 0.3 compared with > 0.7 for the L394T mutant. On the other hand, L394T,K482N exhibited a significant activation in the presence of GTPγS (Fig. 6B). This activation, which was never observed in K482N/aca− cells, was also detected when the adenylyl cyclase activity was measured in vivo after receptor stimulation (Fig. 6C).Figure 6Developmental and biochemical phenotype of L394T,K482N/aca− cells.A, aca− and L394T,K482N/aca− cells were grown in liquid culture and washed, and 1 × 108 cells were plated on non-nutrient agar on 35-mm plates at 22 °C.

D. discoideum,Drosophila, and mammals all express enzymes that are predicted to display two sets of 6 transmembrane domains followed by a large cytoplasmic loop (Fig. 7). Although it has been proposed that some adenylyl cyclases are responsive to transmembrane potential, the exact function of the transmembrane spans has remained largely unknown (19Reddy R. Smith D. Wayman G. Wu Z. Villacres E.C. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14340-14346Google Scholar). Our data show that regions linking the transmembrane domains to the cytoplasmic loops are important for proper regulation of the enzyme. The crystal structure of the soluble adenylyl cyclase with Gsα revealed that the α-subunit of G proteins binds to a crevice on the outside of the C2 loop on residues mainly located on the α2 helix, as well as to residues on the N-terminal portion of the C1 loop (8Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Google Scholar). The Leu-394 residue of ACA that is mutated in this study is located ∼35 amino acids upstream of this N-terminal portion of the C1 loop (Fig. 7). In fact, important biochemical differences between the soluble and native forms of adenylyl cyclases have been observed. First, the affinity of the soluble adenylyl cyclase for Gsα is significantly reduced, ∼50-fold, compared with the native enzyme (20Tang W.J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Google Scholar, 21Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Google Scholar). Second, the effects of Gβγ-subunits on the chimeric soluble preparations do not recapitulate what has been observed with the purified full-length enzymes (22Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Google Scholar, 23Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16967-16974Google Scholar). Finally, the maximal stimulated activity is ∼10-fold higher for the soluble enzyme (21Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Whisnant R.E. Kleuss C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22265-22271Google Scholar, 22Taussig R. Quarmby L.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9-12Google Scholar). Moreover, the F400Y mutation in the type V molecule, which showed increased basal activity and sensitivity to Gsα and forskolin, did not alter the enzymatic activity of the soluble construct bearing the same substitution (24Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 895-901Google Scholar, 25Hatley M.E. Benton B.K. Xu J. Manfredi J.P. Gilman A.G. Sunahara R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38626-38632Google Scholar). It has been shown that the C1b domain of adenylyl cyclases (which is absent in these constructs) possesses regulatory properties (26Dessauer C.W. Tesmer J.J.G. Sprang S.R. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25831-25839Google Scholar, 27Scholich K. Barbier A.J. Mullenix J.B. Patel T.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2915-2920Google Scholar, 28Scholich K. Wittpoth C.

Chen Y. Shelton R. Tang W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8500-8506Google Scholar). Particularly, the type VI enzyme has a cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site within its C1b region that dampens Gsα-mediated activation (32Chen Y. Harry A. Li J. Smit M.J. Bai X. Magnusson R. Pieroni J.P. Weng G. Iyengar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14100-14104Google Scholar). In addition, glycosylation of the extracellular domains of the type VI enzyme has recently been shown to be important for catalytic activity (33Wu G.C. Lai H.L. Lin Y.W. Chu Y.T. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35450-35457Google Scholar). It is thus possible that some of the differences observed between the native and soluble forms of adenylyl cyclases could be explained by the lack of these domains in the soluble constructs. Our data support and extend these observations by defining yet another region of the native structure that is critical for activation.Figure 7Sequence analysis of the location of the ACA mutants. The C1 and C2 domains of D. discoideumACA and the mammalian type II adenylyl cyclases were aligned using ClustalW analysis. The amino acid position of the sequences is shown at the end of each line. The secondary structure of the C1 loop (8Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Google Scholar) is drawn below the consensus sequence inblue. The Leu-394 and Lys-482 residues are shown inred and blue, respectively. The L405S and F421S mutations are shown in green. The putative native structure of adenylyl cyclases is illustrated in the bottom left corner. The boxed region represents the sequence contained within the soluble construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Hatley et al. (25Hatley M.E. Benton B.K. Xu J. Manfredi J.P. Gilman A.G. Sunahara R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38626-38632Google Scholar) isolated mutants of the type II enzyme that rescued the cyclase-null Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain. All mutations mapped to the cytoplasmic loops of the enzyme. To investigate the biochemical defect of the mutants, the substitutions were engineered in the type V C1/type II C2 soluble construct. Of 13 mutants analyzed in this context, only a few displayed substantial changes in adenylyl cyclase activity when compared with the wild type control. Because the activity of the mutants was not measured in the context of the native type II enzyme, the lack of change in basal activity in most of the mutants analyzed may be due to the absence of the transmembrane domains or, alternatively, to the supersensitivity of the yeast screen.We have shown that the activity of native adenylyl cyclases can be dramatically modulated by substituting Leu-394 of ACA. This residue is conserved in eight of nine of the mammalian adenylyl cyclases (Fig. 7) (12Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18333-18336Google Scholar). Substituting Leu-394 of ACA with a variety of other residues gives rise to mutants possessing high basal activity. Intriguingly, the substitutions lead to graded ranges of high basal activity suggesting that each mutant acquires a conformation that progressively reproduces the active state of the enzyme and that the Leu-394 position is critical in the formation of an activated conformation of adenylyl cyclases. This type of graded effect has also been observed when the Ala-293 position of the α1B-adrenergic receptor is mutated to other amino acids (34Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Google Scholar). A closer analysis of the nature of the amino acids leading to the broad spectrum of intrinsic adenylyl cyclase activation reveals no particular allegiance regarding charge, size, or hydrophobicity. Surprisingly, the subtlest mutation (L394I) provides significant constitutive activity. It thus seems that changes in the local conformation is responsible for the acquired high activity. Consequently, we do not expect that substitutions of this particular residue in other adenylyl cyclases will lead to constitutively active enzymes. Indeed, the mammalian type V enzyme harbors a serine at the corresponding Leu-394 position and does not display unusually high basal activity. We propose that changes in the N terminus region of the C1 loop will lead to enzymes that display high basal activity. A screen similar to the one we developed for ACA will be required to identify such mutations in mammalian enzymes (12Parent C.A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18333-18336Google Scholar).Mutations localized to the N terminus of the C1 loop of ACA also give rise to enzymes that are non-responsive to G proteins. In a previous study, we isolated a mutant that harbored two point mutations (L405S and F421S) adjacent to the Leu-394 position (Fig. 7). This mutant showed normal enzymatic activity in the presence of MnSO4. However, it was devoid of any G protein-mediated activation (16Parent C.A. Deveotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22693-22696Google Scholar). This behavior is identical to the one observed with the Del mutant engineered in the present study. Interestingly, the AAAL mutant had the opposite phenotype displaying increased G protein-mediated activation compared with the wild type enzyme. Taken together, these mutants, which all harbor mutations in a discrete region outside the soluble domains, underscore the importance of this region on the activation potential of adenylyl cyclases.Structural information shows that the C1/C2 heterodimer structure is based on highly organized interactions between the two domains. It has been suggested that extensive hydrogen bonding between the β4-β5 loops of C2 and the β2-β3 loops of C1 exist and that alterations in these interactions have deleterious effects on enzymatic activity (8Tesmer J.J.G. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Google Scholar). The ACA K482N mutant, which is specifically devoid of G protein-stimulated activity, harbors a point mutation in the highly conserved β2 loop of C1 (Fig. 7). Mutations of this exact residue in mammalian adenylyl cyclases also give rise to defective enzymes (35Tang W.J. Stanzel M. Gilman A.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14563-14572Google Scholar,36Zimmermann G. Zhou D. Taussig R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19650-19655Google Scholar). The addition of the constitutive mutation L394T to the K482N substitution biochemically and phenotypically suppresses the defects of the K482N mutant. The L394T,K482N/aca− cells regain the capacity to aggregate, respond to GTPγS, and show a significant response to receptor stimulation. As with the original K482N/aca− mutant, these results again show that the Lys-482 residue is not essential for the catalytic activation of adenylyl cyclases. The fact that the constitutive mutation can suppress the loss-of-function defect shows that the two sites, although distant, influence each other. Intriguingly, whereas the double mutant regains the capacity to be activated by G proteins, it does not exhibit the constitutive activity of the L394T mutant. It thus appears that the hig"
