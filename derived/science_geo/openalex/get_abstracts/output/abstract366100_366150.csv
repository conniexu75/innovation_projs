https://openalex.org/W2024108088,"Patrick Concannon and colleagues present a type 1 diabetes genome-wide association study and meta-analysis in 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples, reporting 22 newly identified loci. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common autoimmune disorder that arises from the action of multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. We report the findings of a genome-wide association study of T1D, combined in a meta-analysis with two previously published studies. The total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples. Forty-one distinct genomic locations provided evidence for association with T1D in the meta-analysis (P < 10−6). After excluding previously reported associations, we further tested 27 regions in an independent set of 4,267 cases, 4,463 controls and 2,319 affected sib-pair (ASP) families. Of these, 18 regions were replicated (P < 0.01; overall P < 5 × 10−8) and 4 additional regions provided nominal evidence of replication (P < 0.05). The many new candidate genes suggested by these results include IL10, IL19, IL20, GLIS3, CD69 and IL27."
https://openalex.org/W2001629081,"Daniel Levy and colleagues report a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for blood pressure traits as part of the CHARGE consortium, reporting eight loci with replicated association to systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure, with one of these loci also associated to hypertension. Blood pressure is a major cardiovascular disease risk factor. To date, few variants associated with interindividual blood pressure variation have been identified and replicated. Here we report results of a genome-wide association study of systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure and hypertension in the CHARGE Consortium (n = 29,136), identifying 13 SNPs for SBP, 20 for DBP and 10 for hypertension at P < 4 × 10−7. The top ten loci for SBP and DBP were incorporated into a risk score; mean BP and prevalence of hypertension increased in relation to the number of risk alleles carried. When ten CHARGE SNPs for each trait were included in a joint meta-analysis with the Global BPgen Consortium (n = 34,433), four CHARGE loci attained genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) for SBP (ATP2B1, CYP17A1, PLEKHA7, SH2B3), six for DBP (ATP2B1, CACNB2, CSK-ULK3, SH2B3, TBX3-TBX5, ULK4) and one for hypertension (ATP2B1). Identifying genes associated with blood pressure advances our understanding of blood pressure regulation and highlights potential drug targets for the prevention or treatment of hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2129254992,"Christopher Newton-Cheh and colleagues report a genome-wide association study for blood pressure traits as part of the Global BPgen consortium. They report eight loci with replicated association to systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure, with each also showing association to hypertension. Elevated blood pressure is a common, heritable cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. To date, identification of common genetic variants influencing blood pressure has proven challenging. We tested 2.5 million genotyped and imputed SNPs for association with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in 34,433 subjects of European ancestry from the Global BPgen consortium and followed up findings with direct genotyping (N ≤ 71,225 European ancestry, N ≤ 12,889 Indian Asian ancestry) and in silico comparison (CHARGE consortium, N = 29,136). We identified association between systolic or diastolic blood pressure and common variants in eight regions near the CYP17A1 (P = 7 × 10−24), CYP1A2 (P = 1 × 10−23), FGF5 (P = 1 × 10−21), SH2B3 (P = 3 × 10−18), MTHFR (P = 2 × 10−13), c10orf107 (P = 1 × 10−9), ZNF652 (P = 5 × 10−9) and PLCD3 (P = 1 × 10−8) genes. All variants associated with continuous blood pressure were associated with dichotomous hypertension. These associations between common variants and blood pressure and hypertension offer mechanistic insights into the regulation of blood pressure and may point to novel targets for interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W1988986134,"CD133+ populations of human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells are reportedly enriched for tumor stem cells (TSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs). Approximately 40% of freshly isolated GBM specimens, however, do not contain CD133+ tumor cells, raising the possibility that CD133 may not be a universal enrichment marker for GBM TSCs/TICs. Here we demonstrate that stage-specific embryonic antigen 1(SSEA-1/LeX)+ GBM cells fulfill the functional criteria for TSC/TIC, since (1) SSEA-1+ cells are highly tumorigenic in vivo, unlike SSEA-1- cells; (2) SSEA-1+ cells can give rise to both SSEA-1+ and SSEA-1- cells, thereby establishing a cellular hierarchy; and (3) SSEA-1+ cells have self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potentials. A distinct subpopulation of SSEA-1+ cells was present in all but one of the primary GBMs examined (n = 24), and most CD133+ tumor cells were also SSEA-1+, suggesting that SSEA-1 may be a general TSC/TIC enrichment marker in human GBMs."
https://openalex.org/W1967490910,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a heritable component and is an important global public health problem because of its high prevalence and morbidity. We conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify susceptibility loci for glomerular filtration rate, estimated by serum creatinine (eGFRcrea) and cystatin C (eGFRcys), and CKD (eGFRcrea < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) in European-ancestry participants of four population-based cohorts (ARIC, CHS, FHS, RS; n = 19,877; 2,388 CKD cases), and tested for replication in 21,466 participants (1,932 CKD cases). We identified significant SNP associations (P < 5 × 10(-8)) with CKD at the UMOD locus, with eGFRcrea at UMOD, SHROOM3 and GATM-SPATA5L1, and with eGFRcys at CST and STC1. UMOD encodes the most common protein in human urine, Tamm-Horsfall protein, and rare mutations in UMOD cause mendelian forms of kidney disease. Our findings provide new insights into CKD pathogenesis and underscore the importance of common genetic variants influencing renal function and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1987432765,"Cell-surface death receptors such as DR4 and DR5 trigger apoptosis through a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) that recruits the apical protease caspase-8. Apoptosis commitment requires efficient activation and autocatalytic release of caspase-8 into the cytoplasm to engage executioner caspases. While DISC recruitment initiates caspase-8 stimulation, full activation of the protease depends on further molecular aggregation events that are not fully understood. Here, we show that death receptor ligation induces polyubiquitination of caspase-8, through a previously unknown interaction of the DISC with a cullin3 (CUL3)-based E3 ligase. CUL3-mediated caspase-8 polyubiquitination required the RING box protein RBX1, whereas the deubiquitinase A20 reversed this modification. The ubiquitin-binding protein p62/sequestosome-1 promoted aggregation of CUL3-modified caspase-8 within p62-dependent foci, leading to full activation and processing of the enzyme and driving commitment to cell death. These results identify a mechanism that positively controls apoptosis signaling by polyubiquitination and aggregation of a key initiator caspase."
https://openalex.org/W2080155427,"<h2>Summary</h2> Lrig1 is a marker of human interfollicular epidermal stem cells and helps maintain stem cell quiescence. We show that, in mouse epidermis, Lrig1 defines the hair follicle junctional zone adjacent to the sebaceous glands and infundibulum. <i>Lrig1</i> is a Myc target gene; loss of <i>Lrig1</i> increases the proliferative capacity of stem cells in culture and results in epidermal hyperproliferation in vivo. Lrig1-expressing cells can give rise to all of the adult epidermal lineages in skin reconstitution assays. However, during homeostasis and on retinoic acid stimulation, they are bipotent, contributing to the sebaceous gland and interfollicular epidermis. β-catenin activation increases the size of the junctional zone compartment, and loss of <i>Lrig1</i> causes a selective increase in β-catenin-induced ectopic hair follicle formation in the interfollicular epidermis. Our results suggest that <i>Lrig1</i>-positive cells constitute a previously unidentified reservoir of adult mouse interfollicular epidermal stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2080896401,"A chromosomal translocation found in certain acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients results in fusion of the PHD finger of a chromatin-binding protein to a nucleoporin NUP98. One such fusion protein is now reported to be a potent oncoprotein inducing AML. Introducing mutations in the PHD finger that abrogate its binding to histone H3 trimethylated at Lys4 is shown to abolish tumorigenesis. By binding chromatin, the NUP98-PHD fusion seems to lock developmentally important genes into an active state. Deregulation of an 'effector' of histone modifications can therefore lead to oncogenesis. A chromosomal translocation found in certain acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients results in fusion of the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger of a chromatin-binding protein to a common fusion partner, nucleoporin-98 (NUP98). By binding chromatin, the NUP98–PHD fusion protein—found to be a potent oncoprotein that induces AML—apparently locks developmentally important genes into an active state. Histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) has been proposed as a critical component in regulating gene expression, epigenetic states, and cellular identities1. The biological meaning of H3K4me is interpreted by conserved modules including plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers that recognize varied H3K4me states1,2. The dysregulation of PHD fingers has been implicated in several human diseases, including cancers and immune or neurological disorders3. Here we report that fusing an H3K4-trimethylation (H3K4me3)-binding PHD finger, such as the carboxy-terminal PHD finger of PHF23 or JARID1A (also known as KDM5A or RBBP2), to a common fusion partner nucleoporin-98 (NUP98) as identified in human leukaemias4,5, generated potent oncoproteins that arrested haematopoietic differentiation and induced acute myeloid leukaemia in murine models. In these processes, a PHD finger that specifically recognizes H3K4me3/2 marks was essential for leukaemogenesis. Mutations in PHD fingers that abrogated H3K4me3 binding also abolished leukaemic transformation. NUP98–PHD fusion prevented the differentiation-associated removal of H3K4me3 at many loci encoding lineage-specific transcription factors (Hox(s), Gata3, Meis1, Eya1 and Pbx1), and enforced their active gene transcription in murine haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Mechanistically, NUP98–PHD fusions act as ‘chromatin boundary factors’, dominating over polycomb-mediated gene silencing to ‘lock’ developmentally critical loci into an active chromatin state (H3K4me3 with induced histone acetylation), a state that defined leukaemia stem cells. Collectively, our studies represent, to our knowledge, the first report that deregulation of the PHD finger, an ‘effector’ of specific histone modification, perturbs the epigenetic dynamics on developmentally critical loci, catastrophizes cellular fate decision-making, and even causes oncogenesis during mammalian development."

https://openalex.org/W2110702717,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are isolated from the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts, whereas epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) are derived from the postimplantation epiblast and display a restricted developmental potential. Here we characterize pluripotent states in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse strain, which prior to this study was considered ""nonpermissive"" for ESC derivation. We find that NOD stem cells can be stabilized by providing constitutive expression of Klf4 or c-Myc or small molecules that can replace these factors during in vitro reprogramming. The NOD ESCs and iPSCs appear to be ""metastable,"" as they acquire an alternative EpiSC-like identity after removal of the exogenous factors, while their reintroduction converts the cells back to ICM-like pluripotency. Our findings suggest that stem cells from different genetic backgrounds can assume distinct states of pluripotency in vitro, the stability of which is regulated by endogenous genetic determinants and can be modified by exogenous factors."
https://openalex.org/W2089542359,"The authors test whether experience-dependent neocortical modifications need Ube3a, an ubiquitin ligase implicated in autism and Angelman syndrome, using a mouse model of Angelman syndrome. They find that experience-dependent maturation of excitatory circuits in the visual cortex is impaired in these mice and that there are deficits in plasticity. This loss of plasticity was reversible with visual deprivation. Experience-dependent maturation of neocortical circuits is required for normal sensory and cognitive abilities, which are distorted in neurodevelopmental disorders. We tested whether experience-dependent neocortical modifications require Ube3a, an E3 ubiquitin ligase whose dysregulation has been implicated in autism and Angelman syndrome. Using visual cortex as a model, we found that experience-dependent maturation of excitatory cortical circuits was severely impaired in Angelman syndrome model mice deficient in Ube3a. This developmental defect was associated with profound impairments in neocortical plasticity. Normal plasticity was preserved under conditions of sensory deprivation, but was rapidly lost by sensory experiences. The loss of neocortical plasticity is reversible, as late-onset visual deprivation restored normal synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, Ube3a-deficient mice lacked ocular dominance plasticity in vivo when challenged with monocular deprivation. We conclude that Ube3a is necessary for maintaining plasticity during experience-dependent neocortical development and suggest that the loss of neocortical plasticity contributes to deficits associated with Angelman syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W2064966510,"Despite rapid advances in the identification of genes involved in disease, the predictive power of the genotype remains limited, in part owing to poorly understood effects of second-site modifiers. Here we demonstrate that a polymorphic coding variant of RPGRIP1L (retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator-interacting protein-1 like), a ciliary gene mutated in Meckel-Gruber (MKS) and Joubert (JBTS) syndromes, is associated with the development of retinal degeneration in individuals with ciliopathies caused by mutations in other genes. As part of our resequencing efforts of the ciliary proteome, we identified several putative loss-of-function RPGRIP1L mutations, including one common variant, A229T. Multiple genetic lines of evidence showed this allele to be associated with photoreceptor loss in ciliopathies. Moreover, we show that RPGRIP1L interacts biochemically with RPGR, loss of which causes retinal degeneration, and that the Thr229-encoded protein significantly compromises this interaction. Our data represent an example of modification of a discrete phenotype of syndromic disease and highlight the importance of a multifaceted approach for the discovery of modifier alleles of intermediate frequency and effect."

https://openalex.org/W2060012772,"The existence of physically distinct synaptic vesicle populations with different functional properties has been debated. Here, Fredj and Burrone use a new method of labeling the synaptic vesicle protein VAMP to demonstrate that vesicles labeled during spontaneous fusion are from a different population than those labeled during evoked fusion. Synapses relay information through the release of neurotransmitters stored in presynaptic vesicles. The identity, kinetics and location of the vesicle pools that are mobilized by neuronal activity have been studied using a variety of techniques. We created a genetically encoded probe, biosyn, which consists of a biotinylated VAMP2 expressed at presynaptic terminals. We exploited the high-affinity interaction between streptavidin and biotin to label biosyn with fluorescent streptavidin during vesicle fusion. This approach allowed us to tag vesicles sequentially to visualize and establish the identity of presynaptic pools. Using this technique, we were able to distinguish between two different pools of vesicles in rat hippocampal neurons: one that was released in response to presynaptic activity and another, distinct vesicle pool that spontaneously fused with the plasma membrane. We found that the spontaneous vesicles belonged to a 'resting pool' that is normally not mobilized by neuronal activity and whose function was previously unknown."

https://openalex.org/W2054991032,"The basolateral amygdala (BLA) mediates the facilitating effects of emotions on memory. The BLA's enhancing influence extends to various types of memories, including striatal-dependent habit formation. To shed light on the underlying mechanisms, we carried out unit and local field potential (LFP) recordings in BLA, striatum, auditory cortex and intralaminar thalamus in cats trained on a stimulus-response task in which the presentation of one of two tones predicted reward delivery. The coherence of BLA, but not of cortical or thalamic, LFPs was highest with striatal gamma activity, and intra-BLA muscimol infusions selectively reduced striatal gamma power. Moreover, coupling of BLA-striatal unit activity increased when LFP gamma power was augmented. Early in training, the rewarded and unrewarded tones elicited a modest increase in coherent BLA-striatal gamma. As learning progressed, this gamma coupling selectively increased in relation to the rewarded tone. Thus, coherent gamma oscillations coordinate amygdalostriatal interactions during learning and might facilitate synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2160019572,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are an attractive source of cells for disease modeling in vitro and may eventually provide access to cells/tissues for the treatment of many degenerative diseases. However, applications of ESC-derived cell types are largely hindered by the lack of highly efficient methods for lineage-specific differentiation. Using a high-content screen, we have identified a small molecule, named stauprimide, that increases the efficiency of the directed differentiation of mouse and human ESCs in synergy with defined extracellular signaling cues. Affinity-based methods revealed that stauprimide interacts with NME2 and inhibits its nuclear localization. This, in turn, leads to downregulation of c-Myc, a key regulator of the pluripotent state. Thus, our findings identify a chemical tool that primes ESCs for efficient differentiation through a mechanism that affects c-Myc expression, and this study points to an important role for NME2 in ESC self-renewal."
https://openalex.org/W2021304700,"The tumor predisposition disorder neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders of the nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the Nf1 tumor-suppressor gene, which encodes a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates p21-RAS. Development of malignant nerve tumors and neurofibromas occurs frequently in NF1. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms mediating the initiation and progression of these complex tumors, or the identity of the specific cell type that gives rise to dermal or cutaneous neurofibromas. In this study, we identify a population of stem/progenitor cells residing in the dermis termed skin-derived precursors (SKPs) that, through loss of Nf1, form neurofibromas.

In the classic “initiation and promotion” experiments involving two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis, increasing the time interval between initiation with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and promotion with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) had no effect on papilloma formation (Stenback et al., 1981Stenback F.

Because epidermal epithelial cells have a short life span, tumor-initiating cells are likely epithelial stem/progenitor cells, suggesting that squamous cell carcinoma of the skin may originate in the stem cells. In fact, recent progress in the field of stem cell research points to the importance of stem cells in the initiation and maintenance of many cancers, including leukemia, sarcomas, blastomas, and carcinomas (Al-Hajj and Clarke, 2004Al-Hajj M.

This body of evidence is based largely on the isolation of cancer stem cells from tumors via cell markers or functional assays. However, for many types of cancer, the cell(s) of origin—i.e., the cell(s) that directly initiate and form a tumor—remain unknown. The tumor predisposition disorder von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is one of the most common genetic disorders of the nervous system, affecting 1 in 3500 individuals worldwide (Szudek et al., 2000Szudek J.

NF1 patients have a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, including developmental, pigment, or neoplastic aberrations of the skin, nervous system, bones, endocrine organs, blood vessels, and eyes. The cardinal features of NF1 are café au lait macules and axillary and groin freckling, combined with multiple peripheral and central nerve tumors (Cichowski and Jacks, 2001Cichowski K. Jacks T.

The development of neurofibromas, the most frequent tumor in NF1, and malignant nerve tumors represents a serious complication of NF1. These are unique and complex tumors that contain proliferating Schwann-like cells and other local supporting elements of the nerve fibers, including perineurial cells, fibroblasts, and blood vessels, as well as infiltration of mast cells. Neurofibromas are classified into three subtypes: cutaneous (dermal), subcutaneous, and plexiform neurofibromas. Dermal forms are exclusively in the skin and occur in virtually all individuals with NF1. They initially appear at puberty and increase in number with age and during pregnancy, implicating a requisite hormonal component (Ferner, 2007Ferner R.E. Neurofibromatosis 1.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 15: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Lakkis and Tennekoon, 2000Lakkis M.M. Tennekoon G.I. Neurofibromatosis type 1. I. General overview.J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 62: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although similar to dermal neurofibromas at the cellular and ultrastructural levels, plexiform neurofibromas develop along a nerve plexus. They occur in about 30% of NF1 individuals and are virtually pathognomonic of the disease (Ferner, 2007Ferner R.E. Neurofibromatosis 1.Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 15: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Unlike their dermal counterparts, plexiform neurofibromas are thought to be congenital and progressively enlarge throughout life. The temporally and spatially distinct clinical presentation of dermal versus plexiform neurofibromas supports the hypothesis that these neurofibromas may originate from distinct progenitor cells. Thus, as elaborated below, a unique feature of NF1 is the appearance of these complex multicellular and idiotypic tumors at two different times (embryonic versus adolescent) and in two distinct locations (nerve plexus versus dermal nerve twigs). The development of genetic murine models for plexiform neurofibroma has permitted identification of the origin of these tumors, demonstrating that they originate from embryonic neural crest-derived progenitors (Cichowski et al., 1999Cichowski K.

Another indication of the dual origin of dermal and plexiform tumors is that mice that develop plexiform tumors with 100% frequency fail to develop dermal tumors, consistent with the idea that differing cells are at play. The fact that dermal tumors appear in adolescence, as well as the increasing appreciation for the existence of a variety of adult tissue stem cells, has led us to consider adult progenitor cells as a source. Miller and coworkers identified and pioneered the study of a population of neural crest-like stem cells present in both human and mouse dermis, named skin-derived precursors (SKPs), that can differentiate along neuronal and glial lineages (Fernandes et al., 2006Fernandes K.J.

The location and pluripotency of these cells made them an attractive potential source for the origin of dermal neurofibromas. In the present study, we show that Nf1-deficient SKPs can give rise to classic plexiform or dermal neurofibromas contingent on their local microenvironment and exhibit the same properties as the embryonic Schwann cell progenitors that give rise to plexiform neurofibromas. Thus, our data point to skin-derived neural progenitors (SKPs), or their derivatives, as the cell of origin of NF1-associated dermal neurofibromas. Furthermore, loss of Nf1 in SKPs is required but not sufficient to induce tumors, suggesting an essential role for the tumor microenvironment, including neurons and hormones, in neurofibroma development. We cultured mouse SKPs that were isolated from either back, neck, or ear skin using a standardized neurosphere-forming assay (Biernaskie et al., 2006Biernaskie J.A. McKenzie I.A. Toma J.G. Miller F.D. Isolation of skin-derived precursors (SKPs) and differentiation and enrichment of their Schwann cell progeny.Nat. Protocols. 2006; 1: 2803-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Importantly, under the same conditions, we did not observe any sphere formation when we cultured bone marrow cells (Figure 1), indicating that these culture conditions have some specificity for neural stem/progenitor cells. As previously demonstrated by Miller and colleagues, SKPs can be propagated in vitro under “undifferentiated” conditions for more than five passages and exhibit a surface marker expression profile similar to that of adult neural stem cells derived from brain dentate gyrus or subventricular zone, including nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Figure 1). In addition, SKPs also expressed fibronectin as previously reported (Toma et al., 2001Toma J.G. Akhavan M. Fernandes K.J. Barnabe-Heider F. Sadikot A. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Isolation of multipotent adult stem cells from the dermis of mammalian skin.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). We also confirmed their ability to generate neural crest derivatives including Schwann cells, neurons, and adipocytes (Figure 1). These results are consistent with the adult stem/progenitor cell nature of SKPs. We next tested the capability to ablate genes of interest in SKPs. We crossed a broadly expressed CMV promoter-driven, tamoxifen-inducible Cre transgene (CMV-CreERT2) (Hayashi and McMahon, 2002Hayashi S. McMahon A.P. Efficient recombination in diverse tissues by a tamoxifen-inducible form of Cre: a tool for temporally regulated gene activation/inactivation in the mouse.Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) into the Flox-stop-Flox ROSA26 reporter background (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar) to generate CMV-CreERT2;ROSA26 mice. When SKPs derived from these mice were X-gal stained following a 48 hr exposure to 1 μM 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, they all turned blue (Figure 2). These results indicated that 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, via Cre activity, can mediate recombination at the ROSA26 locus in these cells and that the system can be adapted for the recombination of floxed alleles. Many cells can give rise to tumors when implanted ectopically. For example, oncogenic fibroblasts can give rise to subcutaneous sarcomas (Gray et al., 1993Gray G.D. Hernandez O.M. Hebel D. Root M. Pow-Sang J.M. Wickstrom E. Antisense DNA inhibition of tumor growth induced by c-Ha-ras oncogene in nude mice.Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 577-580PubMed Google Scholar), and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can give rise to ectopic teratomas (Nussbaum et al., 2007Nussbaum J. Minami E. Laflamme M.A. Virag J.A. Ware C.B. Masino A. Muskheli V. Pabon L. Reinecke H. Murry C.E.

In the context of NF1, neurofibroma formation requires unique interactions between nullizygous Schwann cell precursors, mast cells, and peripheral nerves that then engage aberrant fibroblastic, angiogenic, and ensheathing cell reactions (Yang et al., 2006Yang F.C.

Neurofibromas in NF1: Schwann cell origin and role of tumor environment.Science. 2002; 296: 920-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) To date, there are no reports of a cell type that, when ectopically implanted, can generate a tumor that even remotely resembles the multicellular and structural idiosyncracies of NF1-related neurofibromas. We wished to examine whether Nf1-deficient SKPs could be the elusive cell of origin of dermal neurofibromas. To obtain Nf1−/− SKPs, we first crossed CMV-CreERT2 transgenic mice with Nf1flox/-;ROSA26 mice (Zhu et al., 2002Zhu Y. Ghosh P. Charnay P. Burns D.K. Parada L.F. Neurofibromas in NF1: Schwann cell origin and role of tumor environment.Science. 2002; 296: 920-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) to obtain CMV-CreERT2;Nf1flox/-;ROSA26 mice. We then harvested skin from the backs and necks of these mice, isolated SKPs, and exposed them to 4-OH-tamoxifen. Cre-mediated recombination would be expected to generate Nf1−/−;LacZ+ SKPs. This was verified by genomic analysis of the Nf1 gene and by X-gal staining for LacZ expression (Figure 2). NF1-associated plexiform and dermal neurofibromas always develop in close association with peripheral nerves, whether it is a plexus, in the former case, or dermal twigs, in the latter. We implanted the Nf1−/−;LacZ+ SKPs into the same animal, i.e., as an autograft, to avoid immunological rejection and to maintain a heterozygous microenvironment (Figure 2). When implanted intradermally/subcutaneously, we observed no tumor/neurofibroma formation over the course of 7 months (data not shown). We reasoned that one possible explanation for failure of tumor engraftment might be technical, caused by ineffective association of the mutant SKPs with terminal peripheral nerve projections. The sciatic nerve, a much larger nerve than those found in dermis, is a common site of plexiform neurofibromas in NF1. We therefore next reimplanted the SKPs into the sciatic nerves, where close proximity to the nerve could be achieved. The autologously transplanted Nf1−/−;LacZ+ SKPs gave rise to sciatic plexiform neurofibromas within 2 months postimplantation 100% of the time, whereas the transplanted heterozygous (Nf1+/−) SKPs showed no signs of tumor growth (Figure 3A; and see below). The neurofibromas exhibited the characteristics of human plexiform neurofibromas, being poorly circumscribed, composed primarily of spindle cells, and expressing the Schwann cell marker S100β (Figures 3A and 4). We also observed excess collagen deposition (data not shown) and heavy infiltration of mast cells into these plexiform neurofibromas, a critical component of tumor initiation that is commonly observed in human neurofibromas (Yang et al., 2003Yang F.C. Ingram D.A. Chen S. Hingtgen C.M. Ratner N. Monk K.R. Clegg T. White H. Mead L. Wenning M.J. et al.Neurofibromin-deficient Schwann cells secrete a potent migratory stimulus for Nf1+/− mast cells.J.

To verify that the tumors were arising from the transplanted SKPs and not from some paracrine tumor induction of host sciatic nerve cells, we took advantage of the fact that the transplanted SKPs are lacZ positive and the hosts are not. X-gal staining of the tumors demonstrated that the tumor cells were lacZ positive, and we further demonstrated that the tumor cells had undergone loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for the Nf1 locus (Figure 3B), thus indicating that the neurofibromas were derived from the transplanted SKPs. In addition, the tumors were confined to the site of Nf1−/− SKP implantation and resolved into normal nerve architecture distally (Figure 4). In all experiments, control Nf1-heterozygous SKPs (isolated from the same mouse but not treated with tamoxifen) were simultaneously transplanted into the left sciatic nerve. We observed only slight nerve hyperplasia, and no pathological evidence of neurofibroma was seen. These data indicate that when placed in a favorable microenvironment (in proximity to a peripheral nerve), Nf1-deficient SKPs can give rise to bona fide plexiform neurofibromas. As such, these results show that SKPs have the full potential to generate neurofibromas and suggest that they may be the cell of origin of dermal neurofibroma. Moreover, the essential role of peripheral nerves and the tumor microenvironment in neurofibroma genesis is underscored.Figure 4Neurofibroma Formation at the Site of NF1−/− SKP ImplantationShow full captionH&E staining of a longitudinal section of right sciatic nerve ([A], original magnification 4×) showing neurofibroma formation with features consistent with plexiform neurofibroma, only at the site of SKP implantation ([D], original magnification 20×; [E], original magnification 40×), and not at the site further away from where the Nf1−/− SKPs were implanted ([B], original magnification 20×; [C], original magnification 40×).

These neurofibromas are positive for the Schwann cell marker S100β ([F], original magnification 20×; [G], original magnification 40×). Although we achieved neurofibroma formation by transplantation of purified, Nf1-ablated SKPs, we wished to identify whether endogenous SKPs undergo neurofibromagenesis in situ in response to in vivo Nf1 LOH. To address this issue, we first tested the efficiency of tamoxifen-mediated Cre activation in SKPs in vivo. CMV-CreERT2;ROSA26 mice were subjected to topical tamoxifen administration onto the upper back twice a day for 5 consecutive days. Five days after the last application, we harvested the skin for both X-gal staining and purification of SKPs for subsequent X-gal staining. We observed that both the gross skin and also isolated SKPs were positive for X-gal staining, indicating that the topical tamoxifen was able to penetrate the skin and induce recombination at the flox sites within SKP DNA (Figure 5A). We next applied this tamoxifen administration protocol onto the back and neck skin of neonatal CMV-CreERT2;Nf1flox/− mice to ablate NF1 expression in SKPs in vivo. Six to seven months posttamoxifen application, we observed cutaneous nodules similar to human dermal neurofibromas at the application site on these mice (Figure 5B). These tumors were analyzed histopathologically, and all results indicated that these nodules were, in fact, dermal neurofibromas (Figure 5B). Analyses included hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, S100β expression as well as other markers of Schwann cells, and Leder staining for mast cell infiltration. These results further indicate that the cells of origin for dermal neurofibroma likely reside locally in the skin, since neurofibromas only developed at the site of tamoxifen application on the back and not at distant sites. Moreover, because the latency period is 6–7 months from the time of initiation to visible tumor development, it also suggests that the cells of origin of dermal neurofibroma are likely stem/progenitor cells and that other genetic/microenvironmental events, in addition to loss of NF1, participate in dermal neurofibroma development. In this regard, we observed that these mice have enlarged cutaneous nerves in the proximity of the dermal tumors (Figures 5Bb and 5Bc, arrow). Tamoxifen penetration of the skin would be expected to induce Cre-mediated recombination in diverse cell types including SKPs. For example, terminally differentiated cells of many sources as well as epidermal and hair follicle stem cells might undergo Nf1 loss. However, among these diverse cell types, only SKPs (Figure 3) are known to have the potential to generate the complex multicellular neurofibroma. In patients with NF1, dermal neurofibromas typically first appear around puberty and subsequently continue to appear with time. These tumors have also been shown to increase in number and size during pregnancy and, in certain cases, regress after delivery (Dugoff and Sujansky, 1996Dugoff L. Sujansky E. Neurofibromatosis type 1 and pregnancy.Am. J. Med. Genet. 1996; 66: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, Roth et al., 2008Roth T.M. Ramamurthy P. Muir D. Wallace M.R. Zhu Y. Chang L. Barald K.F. Influence of hormones and hormone metabolites on the growth of Schwann cells derived from embryonic stem cells and on tumor cell lines expressing variable levels of neurofibromin.Dev. Dyn. 2008; 237: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that altered levels of certain hormones at puberty or during pregnancy may provide an important trigger to initiate or enhance dermal neurofibroma formation. Therefore, we next tested whether the hormonal milieu during pregnancy can facilitate induction of dermal neurofibroma development from Nf1−/− SKPs in the skin. We again harvested skin from the backs and necks of male and female CMV-CreERT2;Nf1flox/−;ROSA26 mice for SKP isolation. We then exposed the CMV-CreERT2;Nf1flox/−;ROSA26 SKPs ex vivo to 4-OH-tamoxifen to induce NF1 deletion and dermally reimplanted the Nf1−/−;LacZ+ SKPs back to the same animals. The reimplantations were placed in the dorsal/sacral area to prevent the mice from scratching at the site of implantation. Both male and female mice were then housed in the same cage prior to reimplantation to facilitate breeding, and all female mice eventually became pregnant. Strikingly, only the female mice, but not the male mice, developed cutaneous nodules at the graft site within 3–4 months post-SKP implantation (Figure 6). Because the SKPs are lacZ positive and the hosts are not, we performed X-gal staining on the tumors, which turned blue (Figure 7), indicating that the tumors derived from the transplanted SKPs. We performed histological analysis of these tumors using the published classification scheme for peripheral nerve sheath tumors in murine models (Stemmer-Rachamimov et al., 2004Stemmer-Rachamimov A.O. Louis D.N. Nielsen G.P. Antonescu C.R. Borowsky A.D. Bronson R.T. Burns D.K. Cervera P. McLaughlin M.E. Reifenberger G. et al.Comparative pathology of nerve sheath tumors in mouse models and humans.Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3718-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Paraffin sections were assessed with S100β and GAP43 immunohistochemistry (Schwann cell markers), and Leder (mast cell) and H&E staining. The tumors were circumscribed but unencapsulated and contained abundant mast cell infiltration and S100β+ and S100β− spindle-shaped cells in a disorderly arrangement (Figure 7). Thus, all tumor characteristics were consistent with classic dermal neurofibroma. These results indicate that loss of Nf1 expression in a permissive environment can effectively induce SKPs to form dermal neurofibromas. Moreover, as in the human condition, pregnancy accelerates and enhances tumor appearance, presumably due to hormonal influence. We conclude from these data that SKPs, or their derivatives, can be the cell of origin for NF1-associated dermal neurofibromas.Figure 7Dermal Neurofibromas Arise from Implanted Nf1−/− SKPsShow full caption(A) Cutaneous nodule formation at the site of SKP implantation in female mice.(B) X-gal staining showing the tumor/nodule within the dermis and subcutaneous tissue is lacZ positive.

Severe cutaneous changes in mice globally deficient in SCD1 also indicate a role for SCD1 in maintaining skin lipids. We have generated mice with a skin-specific deletion of SCD1 (SKO) and report here that SKO mice display marked sebaceous gland hypoplasia and depletion of sebaceous lipids. In addition, SKO mice have significantly increased energy expenditure and are protected from high fat diet-induced obesity, thereby recapitulating the hypermetabolic phenotype of global SCD1 deficiency. Genes of fat oxidation, lipolysis, and thermogenesis, including uncoupling proteins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma co-activator-1alpha, are up-regulated in peripheral tissues of SKO mice. However, unlike mice globally deficient in SCD1, SKO mice have an intact hepatic lipogenic response to acute high carbohydrate feeding. Despite increased basal thermogenesis, SKO mice display severe cold intolerance because of rapid depletion of fuel substrates, including hepatic glycogen, to maintain core body temperature. These data collectively indicate that SKO mice have increased cold perception because of loss of insulating factors in the skin. This results in up-regulation of thermogenic processes for temperature maintenance at the expense of fuel economy, illustrating cross-talk between the skin and peripheral tissues in maintaining energy homeostasis."

Common structural features of the mitochondrial carrier family members consist in a tripartite structure (three repeats of ∼100 amino acids), the presence of two transmembrane α-helices separated by hydrophilic loops in each repeat, and the presence of a signature motif at the C terminus of the first helix in each repeat (Ref. 3.Pebay-Peyroula E.

In this study we provide direct evidence that SLC25A42 is a mitochondrial transporter for CoA and PAP. SLC25A42 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles, and shown to transport CoA, dephospho-CoA, PAP, and (deoxy)adenine nucleotides with high specificity and by a counter-exchange mechanism. The main function of SLC25A42 is probably to catalyze the entry of CoA into the mitochondria in exchange for adenine nucleotides and PAP. Radioactive compounds were supplied from Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Campro Scientific, GmbH, The Netherlands. Protein and genomic data bases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) were screened with the protein sequence of SLC25A42 (accession number NM_178526), using BLASTP and TBLASTN. The amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW (version 1.8). The phylogenetic tree was computed using the PAM matrix and MacVector 7.1.1 software (Accelrys, Cambridge, UK). The coding sequence for SLC25A42 was amplified by PCR from human brain cDNA (Clontech). The oligonucleotide primers were synthesized corresponding to the extremities of the coding sequence (accession no. NM_178526), with additional NdeI and EcoRI sites. The amplified product was cloned into the pMW7 expression vector. The SLC25A42-pYES2 and SLC25A10-pYES2 plasmids were constructed by cloning the coding sequences of SLC25A42 and SLC25A10, respectively, into the yeast pYES2 expression vector (Invitrogen) under the control of the GAL10 promoter or the constitutive MIR1 promoter. The LEU5-pRS416 plasmid was constructed by cloning a DNA fragment consisting of the LEU5 open reading frame, of 500 bp upstream and of 260 bp downstream of the open reading frame (amplified from S. cerevisiae genomic DNA by PCR using primers with additional HindIII and BamHI sites) into the low copy centromeric vector pRS416 (10.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pMW7, pYES2, and pRS416 vectors, prepared as above, were transformed into E. coli DH5α cells. Transformants were selected on ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and screened by direct colony PCR and by restriction digestion of purified plasmids. The sequences of the inserts were verified. The overproduction of SLC25A42 as inclusion bodies in the cytosol of E. coli was accomplished as described previously (11.Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem.

SLC25A42 was solubilized in 2% Sarkosyl (w/v) and a small residue was removed by centrifugation (258,000 × g, 20 min). The recombinant protein in Sarkosyl was diluted 11-fold with a buffer containing Tris-HCl, 10 mm (pH 8), and 0.6% Triton X-114 and reconstituted into liposomes by cyclic removal of the detergent with a hydrophobic column of Amberlite beads (Fluka) (13.Palmieri F.

The composition of the initial mixture used for reconstitution was 90 μl of purified SLC25A42 (15 μg of protein), 70 μl of 10% Triton X-114, 90 μl of 10% phospholipids in the form of sonicated liposomes, 10 mm ADP (except where otherwise indicated), 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.6 mg of cardiolipin (Sigma), and water to a final volume of 700 μl. After vortexing, this mixture was recycled 13 times through the Amberlite column (3.5 × 0.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and the substrate at the same concentration as in the starting mixture. All operations were performed at 4 °C, except the passages through Amberlite, which were carried out at room temperature. External substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on Sephadex G-75 columns pre-equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm Tris at pH 8.0 (buffer A). The eluted proteoliposomes were distributed in reaction vessels and used for transport measurements by the inhibitor-stop method (13.Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Transport at 25 °C was started by adding [14C]ADP or other indicated labeled compounds to substrate-loaded proteoliposomes (exchange) or to empty proteoliposomes (uniport). In both cases, transport was terminated by addition of 20 mm pyridoxal-5′-phosphate and 20 mm bathophenanthroline, which in combination and at high concentrations inhibit the activity of several mitochondrial carriers completely and rapidly (see, for example, Refs. 7.Floyd S. Favre C. Lasorsa F.M. Leahy M. Trigiante G. Stroebel P. Marx A. Loughran G. O'Callaghan K. Marobbio C.M. Slotboom D.J. Kunji E.R. Palmieri F. O'Connor R. Mol. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5060-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), although their mechanism of action has not been studied. In controls, the inhibitors were added at the beginning together with the radioactive substrate. All transport measurements were carried out at the same internal and external pH value (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Finally, the external radioactivity was removed from each sample of proteoliposomes by a Sephadex G-75 column; the proteoliposomes were eluted with 50 mm NaCl, and their radioactivity was measured. The experimental values were corrected by subtracting control values. The initial transport rate was calculated from the radioactivity taken up by proteoliposomes after 2 min (in the initial linear range of substrate uptake). Alternatively, the initial transport rate was calculated from the time course of isotope equilibration (13.Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For efflux measurements, proteoliposomes containing 2 mm ADP were labeled with 5 μm [14C]ADP by carrier-mediated exchange equilibration (13.Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). After 30 min, the external radioactivity was removed by passing the proteoliposomes through Sephadex G-75 pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Efflux was started by adding unlabeled external substrate or buffer A alone to aliquots of proteoliposomes and terminated by adding the inhibitors indicated above. For the subcellular localization of SLC25A42 in CHO cells, the protein was fused to EGFP at the C terminus. For this purpose, the SLC25A42 coding sequence was amplified without the termination codon and with additional HindIII and BamHI restriction sites. The PCR product was cloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector (14.Chiesa A. Rapizzi E. Tosello V. Pinton P. de Virgilio M. Fogarty K.E. Rizzuto R. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in-frame with the HA1-EGFP sequence (where HA1 is a 9-amino acid epitope derived from hemagglutinin). CHO cells were grown on 24-mm coverslips to 50–70% confluence and co-transfected according to a standard calcium-phosphate procedure with 4 μg of mtEBFP/pcDNAI (15.Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar), and 4 μg of the modified pcDNA3 plasmid containing the coding sequence of SLC25A42 fused with the EGFP sequence. EGFP and EBFP fluorescence were detected as described before (15.Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). The wild-type W303-1B strain (MATα, ade2-1 leu2-3,112 his311 his3-15 trp1-1 ura3-1) was provided by the EUROFAN resource center EUROSCARF (Frankfurt, Germany). The deletion strain ΔLEU5 was constructed using the PCR-mediated gene disruption technique by replacing the LEU5 open reading frame with the hygromycin B resistance cassette (hphMX3) in the W303-1B strain (16.Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar). LEU5 deletion was verified by PCR. The wild-type and deletion strains were grown in rich (YP) medium, containing 2% Bacto-peptone and 1% yeast extract, supplemented with 3% glycerol, 3% acetate, or 2% dl-lactate. The final pH was adjusted to 4.5. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue dye. N-terminal sequencing was carried out as described previously (17.Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The amount of pure SLC25A42 was estimated by laser densitometry of stained samples, using carbonic anhydrase as protein standard (17.Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The amount of protein incorporated into liposomes was measured as described (17.Fiermonte G. Dolce V. Palmieri F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22782-22787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and varied between 20 and 30% of the protein added to the reconstitution mixture. Because some members of the mitochondrial carrier family are localized in non-mitochondrial membranes (18.Palmieri L. Rottensteiner H. Girzalsky W. Scarcia P. Palmieri F. Erdmann R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5049-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 19.Bedhomme M. Hoffmann M. McCarthy E.A. Gambonnet B. Moran R.G. Rébeillé F. Ravanel S. J. Biol.

Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 438-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the intracellular localization of SLC25A42 was investigated. This aspect was addressed by constructing an expression plasmid containing the GFP nucleotide sequence fused to the coding sequence of SLC25A42 (Fig. 1). CHO cells were transfected with the pcDNA3-SLC25A42-EGFP plasmid, and images were acquired 40–45 h after transfection. About 36% of cells were transfected, and green fluorescence revealed typical mitochondrial localization of SLC25A42. The green fluorescence of the GFP-tagged protein completely overlapped with the blue fluorescence of a mitochondrially targeted BFP (14.Chiesa A. Rapizzi E. Tosello V. Pinton P. de Virgilio M. Fogarty K.E. Rizzuto R. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) co-expressed in the same cells. Thus SLC25A42, which lacks the targeting N-terminal extension, contains in its amino acid sequence the structural information for import into mitochondria, in accordance with data available for other mitochondrial carriers (21.Zara V. Palmieri F. Mahlke K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12077-12081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Brix J. Rüdiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The SLC25A42 gene was expressed at high levels in E. coli C0214(DE3) (Fig. 2, lane 4). The gene product accumulated as inclusion bodies and was purified by centrifugation and washing (Fig. 2, lane 5). The purified protein gave a single band by SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular mass of 36.2 kDa in agreement with the calculated value with initiator methionine (35425 Da). Its identity was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The protein was not detected in bacteria harvested immediately before induction of expression (Fig. 2, lane 2) nor in cells harvested after induction but lacking the coding sequence in the expression vector (Fig. 2, lane 3). Approximately 55 mg of purified protein per liter of culture was obtained. SLC25A42 was reconstituted into liposomes and its transport activities for a variety of nucleotides were tested in homo-exchange experiments (i.e. with the same substrate internally and externally). Using external and internal substrate concentrations of 0.2 and 10 mm, respectively, the reconstituted protein catalyzed active [14C]ADP/ADP, [14C]AMP/AMP, and [14C]ATP/ATP exchanges (Fig. 3) that were inhibited completely by pyridoxal-5′-phosphate and bathophenanthroline. By contrast, despite the long incubation period (i.e. 30 min), virtually no homo-exchange activity was observed for GMP, GDP, GTP, CMP, CDP, CTP, UMP, UTP, TMP, and TTP (Fig. 3). No [14C]ADP/ADP and [14C]AMP/AMP exchange activities were detected when SLC25A42 had been boiled before incorporation into liposomes or if proteoliposomes were reconstituted with Sarkosyl-solubilized material from bacterial cells either lacking the expression vector for SLC25A42 or harvested immediately before induction of expression. Likewise, no such activities were detected in liposomes reconstituted with the four unrelated mitochondrial carriers Sfc1p, Ort1p, Sam5p, and Ggc1p (2.Palmieri F. Agrimi G. Blanco E. Castegna A. Di Noia M.A. Iacobazzi V. Lasorsa F.M. Marobbio C.M. Palmieri L. Scarcia P. Todisco S. Vozza A. Walker J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1249-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which had been expressed and purified from E. coli using the same expression vector. To investigate the substrate specificity of SLC25A42 further, we measured the uptake of [14C]ADP into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with a variety of potential substrates (Fig. 4). The highest activity of [14C]ADP uptake into proteoliposomes was found with internal AMP, ADP, ATP, dADP, PAP, CoA, and dephospho-CoA (Fig. 4). To a lesser extent [14C]ADP also exchanged with internal dAMP, dATP, ADP-ribose, ADP-glucose, 3′-AMP, FAD, and pyrophosphate, and to an even lesser extent with NAD+. In contrast, the uptake of [14C]ADP was negligible in the absence of internal substrate (NaCl present) or in the presence of internal cAMP, adenosine, pantothenate, NMN, NADP+, FMN, thiamine pyrophosphate, thiamine monophosphate, phosphate, sulfate, oxoglutarate, glutamate, and ornithine (Fig. 4) and pyruvate, malate, citrate, aspartate, carnitine, lysine, reduced glutathione, tetrahydrofolate, S-adenosylmethionine, inosine monophosphate, and inosine triphosphate (data not shown). Similar results were obtained by measuring the uptake of [14C]AMP instead of [14C]ADP into proteoliposomes preloaded with different substrates (data not shown). Therefore, the substrate specificity of SLC25A42 is confined essentially to adenine nucleotides, PAP, CoA, and dephospho-CoA. The effects of inhibitors of other mitochondrial carriers on the [14C]ADP/ADP exchange reaction catalyzed by reconstituted SLC25A42 were also examined. The ADP/ADP exchange was inhibited markedly by pyridoxal-5′-phosphate, bathophenanthroline, tannic acid, bromcresol purple, and mersalyl and only partially by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, butylmalonate, phenylsuccinate, 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate, and bongkrekate (Fig. 5). In contrast, little effect was observed with N-ethylmaleimide and carboxyatractyloside. Interestingly, bongkrekic acid inhibited the activity of SLC25A42 partially (51%), whereas carboxyatractyloside had little effect (13%) at a concentration (10 μm) that completely inhibits the ADP/ATP carrier (23.Klingenberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 24.Fiore C. Trezeguet V. Le Saux A. Roux P. Schwimmer C. Dianoux A.C. Noel F. Lauquin G.J.-M. Brandolin G. Vignais P.V. Biochemie (Paris). 1998; 80: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, the [14C]ADP/ADP exchange in reconstituted liposomes was inhibited strongly by externally added PAP, ADP, CoA, and dephospho-CoA, to a lesser extent by AMP, ATP, and dADP, and only slightly by dAMP, dATP, ADP-ribose, ADP-glucose, 3′-AMP, and FAD (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Inhibition of the rate of [14C]ADP/ADP exchange by external substrates. Liposomes reconstituted with SLC25A42 were preloaded internally with 10 mm ADP. Transport was started by adding 40 μm [14C]ADP and stopped after 2 min. External substrates (concentration, 0.4 mm) were added together with [14C]ADP. The values are expressed as a percentage of the [14C]ADP/ADP exchange activity, which was 111 μmol/min × g of protein. Similar results were obtained in at least three independent experiments. ADP-rib, ADP-ribose; ADP-gluc, ADP-glucose; PAP, adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate; Adenos, adenosine; CoA, coenzyme A; dPCoA, dephospho-CoA; PPi, pyrophosphate; ThPP, thiamine pyrophosphate; and ThMP, thiamine monophosphate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Fig. 7, the kinetics are compared for the uptake by proteoliposomes of 40 μm [14C]ADP either as exchange (in the presence of internal 2 mm CoA or dephospho-CoA) or as uniport (in the absence of internal substrate). The uptake of ADP by exchange followed a first order kinetics (rate constant, 0.04 and 0.03 min−1; initial rate, 42.7 and 55.6 mmol/min/g protein for the ADP/CoA and ADP/dephospho-CoA exchanges, respectively), isotopic equilibrium being approached exponentially (Fig. 7). In contrast, the uniport uptake of [14C]ADP was negligible suggesting that SLC25A42 does not catalyze a unidirectional transport of ADP. The addition of 2 mm unlabeled CoA or dephospho-CoA after incubation for 100 min, when radioactive uptake by proteoliposomes had almost reached equilibrium, caused an extensive efflux of radiolabeled ADP. This efflux shows that the [14C]ADP taken up by proteoliposomes is released in exchange for externally added CoA or dephospho-CoA. Therefore, CoA and dephospho-CoA are transported by reconstituted SLC25A42 not only when present inside liposomes but also when added externally. The possibility for SLC25A42 to function also as uniporter was further investigated by measuring the efflux of [14C]ADP from prelabeled active proteoliposomes, because this provides a more sensitive assay for unidirectional transport (13.Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the absence of external substrate, no significant efflux was observed even after incubation for 40 min (Fig. 8). However, upon addition of external PAP, ADP, CoA, or dephospho-CoA an extensive efflux of radioactivity occurred, which was prevented by the presence of pyridoxal-5′-phosphate and bathophenanthroline. These results demonstrate that, at least under the experimental conditions employed, reconstituted SLC25A42 catalyzes an obligatory exchange reaction of substrates.FIGURE 8Efflux of [14C]ADP from proteoliposomes reconstituted in the presence of 2 mm ADP. The internal substrate pool was labeled with [14C]ADP by carrier-mediated exchange equilibration. Then the proteoliposomes were passed through Sephadex G-75. The efflux of [14C]ADP was started by adding buffer A alone (■), 0.5 mm PAP in buffer A (♦), 0.5 mm ADP in buffer A (○), 0.5 mm CoA in buffer A (□), or 0.5 mm dephospho-CoA in buffer A (●). Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The kinetic constants of reconstituted SLC25A42 were determined by measuring the initial transport rate at various external [14C]ADP concentrations in the presence of a fixed saturating concentration of internal PAP, ADP, CoA, or dephospho-CoA (Table 1). Several external substrates were competitive inhibitors of [14C]ADP uptake as they increased the apparent Km without changing the Vmax (not shown). The Ki values of these substrates for SLC25A42 are the following: 27 ± 3.5 μm (PAP), 54 ± 8 μm (ADP), 112 ± 10 μm (CoA), 108 ± 11 μm (dephospho-CoA), 383 ± 55 μm (AMP), 435 ± 51 μm (ATP), and 457 ± 62 μm (dADP). These results show that CoA and dephospho-CoA have a high affinity for SLC25A42; their Ki values are lower than those of AMP and ATP and 2-fold higher than that of ADP. Of note, the affinity of SLC25A42 for PAP is higher than that for any other substrate transported by this carrier. In addition, it is worth noting that the Ki value of CoA for SLC25A42 is similar to the physiological concentrations of cytosolic-free CoA, which in animal tissues can be estimated to range from 15 to 100 μm (25.Leonardi R.

To generate a K+ diffusion potential or a pH difference across the proteoliposomal membrane with the K+ uniporter valinomycin or the K+/H+ exchanger nigericin, respectively, we applied a K+ gradient (mm/mm; in/out or out/in) by adding 50 mm KCl to either side of the membrane in the presence of 1 mm KCl on the opposite side. Unfortunately, under both conditions (i.e. in the presence of 50 mm KCl inside or outside the proteoliposomes) the activity of SLC25A42 measured as ADP/ADP homo-exchange was either abolished with 50 mm K+ inside or drastically diminished (by ∼90%) with 50 mm K+ outside; thus, the effect of valinomycin or nigericin could not be quantifi"

Here, the molecular mechanism of the CPE-claudin interaction was analyzed. Using peptide arrays, recombinant CPE-(116–319) bound to loop 2 peptides of mouse claudin-3, -6, -7, -9, and -14 but not of 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10–13, 15, 16, 18–20, and 22. Substitution peptide mapping identified the central motif 148NPL150VP, supposed to represent a turn region in the loop 2, as essential for the interaction between CPE and murine claudin-3 peptides. CPE-binding assays with claudin-3 mutant-transfected HEK293 cells or lysates thereof demonstrated the involvement of Asn148 and Leu150 of full-length claudin-3 in the binding. CPE-(116–319) and CPE-(194–319) bound to HEK293 cells expressing claudin-3, whereas CPE-(116–319) bound to claudin-5-expressing HEK293 cells, also. This binding was inhibited by substitutions T151A and Q156E in claudin-5. In contrast, removal of the aromatic side chains in the loop 2 of claudin-3 and -5, involved in trans-interaction between claudins, increased the amount of CPE-(116–319) bound. These findings and molecular modeling indicate different molecular mechanisms of claudin-claudin trans-interaction and claudin-CPE interaction. Confocal microscopy showed that CPE-(116–319) and CPE-(194–319) bind to claudin-3 at the plasma membrane, outside cell-cell contacts. Together, these findings demonstrate that CPE binds to the hydrophobic turn and flanking polar residues in the loop 2 of claudin-3 outside tight junctions. The data can be used for the specific design of CPE-based modulators of tight junctions, to improve drug delivery, and as chemotherapeutics for tumors overexpressing claudins.

The clinical use of many promising drug candidates is impeded by unacceptable pharmacokinetics (1.White R.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The ability of a drug to pass through tissue barriers is a major determinant for its delivery. In epithelia and endothelia, the paracellular route is blocked by tight junctions (TJ). 4The abbreviations used are: TJtight junctionsCPEClostridium perfringens enterotoxinECLextracellular loopCldclaudinSPRsurface plasmon resonanceBLUBoehringer light unitsGSTglutathione S-transferaseCFPcyan fluorescent proteinYFPyellow fluorescent proteinHRPhorseradish peroxidasePBSphosphate-buffered salineHEKhuman embryonic kidneyTEERtransepithelial electrical resistance. Different approaches have been used to enhance transcellular drug delivery. These include the use of influx transporters, blocking of efflux transporters, or receptor-mediated endocytosis (2.Mizuno N. Niwa T. Yotsumoto Y. Sugiyama Y. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 425-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Alternative approaches aim to enhance paracellular permeation of drugs by loosening the TJ (3.Aungst B.J. J. Pharm. Sci. 2000; 89: 429-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 4.Salama N.N. Eddington N.D. Fasano A. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2006; 58: 15-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This strategy has the advantage that it could improve the delivery of structurally unrelated drugs, and the drug itself does not have to be modified. Although different TJ modulators have been described, most of these are based on surfactants or chelators (3.Aungst B.J. J. Pharm. Sci. 2000; 89: 429-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). These often have low tissue specificity and cause severe side effects, e.g. exfoliation of cells, which irreversibly compromise the barrier functions (5.Hochman J. Artursson P. J. Control. Release. 1994; 29: 253-267Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 6.Yamamoto A. Uchiyama T. Nishikawa R. Fujita T. Muranishi S. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fewer side effects may be obtained by more specific modulation of a molecular key component of the TJ (7.Kondoh M. Takahashi A. Fujii M. Yagi K. Watanabe Y. Biol. Pharm.

TJ consist of transmembrane proteins, mainly the tetraspan proteins of the claudin family, as well as occludin and tricellulin (8.Chiba H. Osanai M. Murata M. Kojima T. Sawada N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 588-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Other molecules associated with TJ include membrane-bound scaffolding and signaling proteins (9.González-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Nava P. Jaramillo B.E. Progr. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 81: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). However, claudins (Cld) are the major functional constituent of TJ (10.Furuse M. Sasaki H. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Claudins tighten the paracellular space, selectively for tissue, size, and charge. The tissue-specific combination of the claudin subtypes present in heteropolymers is assumed to determine the permeability properties of TJ (11.Krause G. Winkler L. Mueller S.L. Haseloff R.F. Piontek J. Blasig I.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 631-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that tissue-specific drug delivery via the paracellular route would be possible by modulation of the barrier-function of claudins in a subtype-specific manner (7.Kondoh M. Takahashi A. Fujii M. Yagi K. Watanabe Y. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2006; 29: 1783-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A subset of claudins, e.g. Cld3 and -4 but not -1 and -2, have been shown to be receptors for Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) with high association constants of about 108m−1 (12.Fujita K. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Sonoda N. Furuse M. Tsukita S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). CPE causes one of the most common food-borne diseases (13.Adak G.K. Long S.M. O'Brien S.J. Gut. 2002; 51: 832-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). It consists of two functional domains, an N-terminal region that mediates the cytotoxic effect and the C-terminal region (CPE-(184–319)), which binds to extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) of Cld3 but not of Cld1 nor to the ECL1 of Cld3 (12.Fujita K. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Sonoda N. Furuse M. Tsukita S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Treatment of epithelial monolayers with non-cytotoxic CPE-(184–319) increases paracellular permeability (14.Sonoda N. Furuse M. Sasaki H. Yonemura S. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). CPE-(184–319) enhanced drug absorption in rat jejunum 400-fold relative to sodium caprate, which is in clinical use (15.Kondoh M. Masuyama A. Takahashi A. Asano N. Mizuguchi H. Koizumi N. Fujii M. Hayakawa T. Horiguchi Y. Watanbe Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, CPE is a promising tool to specifically modulate claudins, the key constituents of TJ, and thereby to enhance paracellular drug delivery. In addition, some studies have suggested the use of CPE for the chemotherapy of tumors overexpressing claudins (16.Kominsky S.L. Tyler B. Sosnowski J. Brady K. Doucet M. Nell D. Smedley 3rd, J.G. McClane B. Brem H. Sukumar S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7977-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17.Santin A.D. Bellone S. Marizzoni M. Palmieri M. Siegel E.R. McKenney J.K. Hennings L. Comper F. Bandiera E. Pecorelli S. Cancer. 2007; 109: 1312-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18.Morin P.J. Dis. Markers. 2007; 23: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cld1 and -5 are potential targets for transepidermal and brain drug delivery, respectively (19.Furuse M. Hata M. Furuse K. Yoshida Y. Haratake A. Sugitani Y. Noda T. Kubo A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1099-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar, 20.Nitta T. Hata M. Gotoh S. Seo Y. Sasaki H. Hashimoto N. Furuse M. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that these claudins do not interact with CPE (12.Fujita K. Katahira J. Horiguchi Y. Sonoda N. Furuse M. Tsukita S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Modification of CPE could enhance and/or shift its claudin-subtype specificity. Therefore, the design of CPE-based TJ modulators could permit efficient claudin subtype-specific modulation, which would also be tissue-specific modulation of TJ. To achieve this, an understanding of the molecular mechanism of the CPE-claudin interaction is a necessary prerequisite. In this study, we identify the residues within the ECL2 of Cld3 that are involved in interaction with CPE. For construction of plasmids encoding GST-CPE-(116–319), GST-CPE-(194–319), and GST-CPE-(290–319) fusion proteins, cDNA of CPE (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Horiguchi, Osaka, Japan) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-4T1 (GE Healthcare) using EcoRI and SalI; GST-CPE-(194–309) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Plasmids encoding Cld5wt-CFP, Cld5wt-YFP, and mutant fusion proteins have been described previously (21.Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C. Wiesner B. Krause G. Blasig I.E. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). A pECFP-N1-plasmid containing the Cld3 sequence with a stop codon ahead of CFP was generated by subcloning full-length Cld3 with SalI and BamHI from pSK-Cl-3, kindly provided by Dr. M. Furuse (Kyoto, Japan). Similarly, Cld5wt was subcloned from pGTCL-5 (Dr. M. Furuse, Kyoto, Japan) into pEYFP-N1 using EcoRI. To generate the in-frame fusion Cld3wt-CFP, the stop codon in pECFP-N1-Cld3, was removed by side-directed mutagenesis. Cld3wt-YFP was generated by subcloning Cld3wt-CFP in pECFP-N1 into pEYFP-N1 using SalI and BamHI. The plasmids encoding mutants of Cld3 (Y147A, N148D, L150A, E153V, A154N, and Q155E, N148D/L150A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pECFP-N1-Cld3wt. pEGFP-Cld4 was kindly provided by Dr. W. Hunziker (Singapore). Rabbit anti-Cld3, rabbit anti-Cld4, rabbit anti-Cld5, HRP- and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies, HRP-, Cy3-, and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen. Mouse anti-GST (GST-2) was from Sigma. To detect CFP and YFP fusion proteins, mouse anti-GFP antibodies (Clontech) were used for Western blots. CPE-(116–319), CPE-(194–319), CPE-(194–309), and CPE-(290–319) with N-terminal GST fusions as well as GST (control) were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Bacteria were grown to A600 = 0.6–0.8, harvested by centrifugation, and lysed in PBS with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) by using an EmulsiFlex-C3 homogenizer (Avestin, Mannheim, Germany). To remove insoluble cell debris, the lysates were centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The recombinant proteins were purified from supernatants using glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and eluted proteins were dialyzed against PBS buffer with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Measurements were performed using a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Claudin3-ECL2 peptides (Cld3-(140–159), Cys-(6-aminocaproic acid)-NTIIRDFYNPLVPEAQKREM; and Cld3-(140–159)N148D/L150T, Cys-(6-aminocaproic acid)-NTIIRDFYDPTVPEAQKREM) were synthesized with N-terminal cysteine followed by a 6-aminocaproic acid linker. Peptides were immobilized on a CM5 chip using the thiol coupling procedure, according to the supplier's instructions (Biacore AB). To determine the binding affinities of GST-CPE-(116–319) and GST-CPE-(290–319), an amount of covalently coupled Cld3-(140–159) peptide, corresponding to a signal increase of ∼1600 resonance units was used. For comparison of Cld3-(140–159) and Cld3-(140–159)N148D/L150T, 500 and 250 resonance units of Cld3 peptides were immobilized, respectively. Binding experiments were performed as described earlier (22.Schmidt A. Utepbergenov D.I. Mueller S.L. Beyermann M. Schneider-Mergener J. Krause G. Blasig I.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1354-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The analytes GST-CPE-(116–319), GST-CPE-(290–319), and GST (control) were injected in concentrations between 0.01 and 20 μm in running buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol). For regeneration 10 mm NaOH solution with 1 m NaCl was used. For every analyte concentration the maximal amount of GST-CPE-(116–319) and GST-CPE-(290–319) bound was calculated in femtomole (∼1000 resonance units = 1 ng of protein bound). Arrays were generated by spot-synthesis using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry as described (23.Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The AutoSpot-Robot ASS 222 (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments AG, Köln, Germany) was used for automatic synthesis of 15–20-mer peptides on Whatman 50 cellulose membranes (C-terminal immobilization). The quality of synthesized peptides was evaluated by mass spectrometry of control spots. For binding experiments membranes were incubated with 10 μg/ml GST-CPE-(116–319) or GST in blocking buffer (Sigma) overnight at 8 °C, followed by incubations with mouse anti-GST and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody in blocking buffer for 1.5 and 1 h at room temperature, respectively. The ECL Western blotting detection reagent (GE Healthcare) was applied and chemiluminescence intensities were measured as Boehringer light units (BLU) using a LumiImager (Roche Applied Science). Determined BLU values of GST-incubated SPOTs were subtracted from BLU values of corresponding GST-CPE-(116–319)-incubated spots (ΔBLU). Background corrected ΔBLU values were normalized to the binding of GST-CPE-(116–319) on Cld3-spots (%Cld3). Caco-2 human intestinal carcinoma cells and HEK293 cells (HEK cells) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units ml−1 penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin, and 1% l-alanyl-l-glutamine. Transient transfections of HEK cells were preformed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Caco-2 cells were seeded into the wells of ECISTM 8W10E+ electrode arrays for ECISTM model 1600R (Applied Biophysics) at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well and grown in a humidified CO2 incubator with 5% CO2. Junctional resistance was measured every 5 min at 400 Hz frequency, as in a previous report (24.Schreibelt G. Kooij G. Reijerkerk A. van Doorn R. Gringhuis S.I. van der Pol S. Weksler B.B. Romero I.A. Couraud P.O. Piontek J. Blasig I.E. Dijkstra C.D. Ronken E. de Vries H.E. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3666-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). When monolayers reached maximum resistance (∼1500 Ω) 10 μg/ml GST-CPE-(116–319) or GST were introduced into the medium. 5 × 105 Caco-2 cells were seeded into a 24-well transwell filter (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). TEER was determined with Endohm electrodes (Millipore). After reaching stable TEER values, cells were incubated with GST-CPE-(116–319) or GST for 16 h. For permeation studies cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml fluorescein (Sigma) in Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer on the apical side and Hanks' balanced salt solution on the basal side for 10 min. 100-μl samples were removed from the basal compartment and the fluorescence units were measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) to calculate the permeation coefficient. Immunocytochemistry was performed as described (25.Blasig I.E. Winkler L. Lassowski B. Mueller S.L. Zuleger N. Krause E. Krause G. Gast K. Kolbe M. Piontek J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2–3 days after transient transfection, HEK cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml GST-CPE-(116–319), GST-CPE-(194–319), or GST for 20 min, 1 h, or 14 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with acetone, incubated with anti-GST antibodies, followed by incubation with anti-Cld3 or anti-Cld5 antibodies, and incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Cy3, or Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Cells were analyzed with the LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). HEK cells seeded in 6-well plates were transiently transfected with Cld3wt, Cld3mutants, or GFP-Cld4. Two to 3 days after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, with Ca2+ and Mg2+, scraped, harvested (300 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and quick frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were lysed (1% Triton X-100 in PBS, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 10 min, and centrifuged (5 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatants were incubated with GST, GST-CPE-(116–319), GST-CPE-(194–319), or GST-CPE-(194–309) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) in mini columns (MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) for 30 min on a shaker at 4 °C. Beads were centrifuged (2 min, 500 × g, 4 °C) and the flow-through (unbound fraction) collected. After washing three times with PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer (eluate). Eluate and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described previously (26.Andreeva A.Y. Krause E. Müller E.C. Blasig I.E. Utepbergenov D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38480-38486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Two to 3 days after transfection, HEK cells expressing Cld3wt, Cld3mutants, Cld3wt-CFP, Cld5wt, Cld5wt-YFP, or Cld5-YFPmutants were incubated with 1 or 10 μg/ml GST-CPE-(116–319), GST-CPE-(194–319), or GST for 1 h at 37 °C in 24- or 12-well plates. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS supplemented with Ca2+ and Mg2+, scraped, and harvested (300 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. For each claudin mutant the ratios of the BLU values of the GST-CPE and the claudin signal were calculated relative to the ratio for the claudinwt (internal standard). The ECL2 of claudins was predicted by alignment of sequences of mouse (human when indicated) Cld-(1–23) with the GCG program package (GCG Wisconsin package, Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). A homology model for Cld3-ECL2-(134–164) was built on the model for murine Cld5-ECL2-(135–165) as described (21.Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C. Wiesner B. Krause G. Blasig I.E. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The Cld5-ECL2 model was based on part of Protein Data Bank structure 2BDV (Phage-related Protein BB2244 from Bordetella bronchiseptica). This resulted in a helix-turn-helix motif for ECL2, where the helices of the ECL2 are extensions of the predicted transmembrane helices 3 and 4 of Cld3. All manual reciprocal dockings, manipulations, and optimizations of ECL2 models were performed with the program Sybyl 7.3 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). The models were energetically minimized, using the AMBER95 force field. Unless stated otherwise, results are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by one-way analysis of variance and followed by an unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.01 was taken as significantly different. The C-terminal end of CPE-(290–319) is sufficient for interactions with Cld3 and Cld4 (27.Hanna P.C. Mietzner T.A. Schoolnik G.K. McClane B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11037-11043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, further regions within CPE-(116–290) have been implicated in binding to Cld3/4 (28.Kokai-Kun J.F. Benton K. Wieckowski E.U. McClane B.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5634-5641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Masuyama A. Kondoh M. Seguchi H. Takahashi A. Harada M. Fujii M. Mizuguchi H. Horiguchi Y. Watanabe Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 314: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To determine whether CPE region 116–290 enhances the interaction of CPE with Cld3-ECL2, we compared binding of GST-CPE-(290–319) with the binding of GST-CPE-(116–319) to peptide Cld3-(140–159) (predicted ECL2, see “Experimental Procedures”). SPR spectroscopy using immobilized Cld3-ECL2-(140–159) showed that a 20-fold higher concentration of GST-CPE-(290–319) compared with GST-CPE-(116–319) was needed to obtain similar amounts of bound CPE (Fig. 1A). This demonstrates that GST-CPE-(116–319) binds much more strongly to Cld3-ECL2 than GST-CPE-(290–319). Thus, GST-CPE-(116–319) was used for further experiments. When confluent monolayers of Caco-2 cells were incubated with GST-CPE-(116–319), a decrease in junctional resistance, TEER, and an increase in paracellular fluorescein permeability compared with GST were detected (Fig. 1, B–D). Thus, GST-CPE-(116–319) binds to native claudins on living cells and influences paracellular tightness. To compare the binding ability of GST-CPE-(116–319) to the ECL2 of different claudins, peptide arrays were used. Peptides corresponding to the predicted ECL2 (11.Krause G. Winkler L. Mueller S.L. Haseloff R.F. Piontek J. Blasig I.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 631-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) of Cld1–22, except -17 and -21 were synthesized on membranes and incubated with GST-CPE-(116–319) or GST as control. GST-CPE-(116–319) specifically bound to ECL2 peptides of Cld3, -6, -7, -9, and -14 but not Cld1, -2, -4, -5, -8, -10–13, -15, -16, -18–20, and -22 (Table 1).TABLE 1GST-CPE-(116–319) binds to peptides corresponding to the extracellular loop two (ECL2) of claudin-3, -6, -7, -9, -14 Open table in a new tab For the identification of amino acids involved in the CPE-claudin interaction, additional peptide arrays were performed. Because GST-CPE-(116–319) did not bind to Cld5-ECL2 peptides (Table 1), we tested whether introduction of defined amino acids of Cld3-ECL2 into Cld5-ECL2 enables binding to CPE. In contrast to single or certain multiple substitutions including E146D, V154E, S155A, and Y158R, specifically the double substitution D149N/T151L in Cld5-ECL2 peptides facilitated the binding of GST-CPE-(116–319) (Table 2, upper part). Similarly, substitution of S149N in Cld2-ECL2 corresponding to substitution of D149N in Cld5 enabled binding of GST-CPE-(116–319) (Table 2, lower part). The additional substitution S155A in Cld2 further increased the binding. For Cld4, the double substitution M151L/A153P permitted binding of GST-CPE-(116–319) (Table 2, lower part). In addition to the peptide arrays, in surface plasmon resonance experiments N148D/L150T blocked binding of superinfused GST-CPE-(116–319) to immobilized CLd3-ECL2 peptides (0.75 μm GST-CPE-(116–319) resulted in binding of 10.3 ± 1.6 fmol of GST-CPE-(116–319) to Cld3wt and 0.0 ± 0.1 fmol of GST-CPE-(116–319) to Cld3-N148D/L150T, n = 4, mean ± S.E.). These data indicate that the positions corresponding to 148 and 150 in murine Cld3 are strongly involved in the claudin-CPE interaction.TABLE 2Introduction of amino acids from the extracellular loop two (ECL2) of murine claudin-3 (Cld3wt) into the ECL2 of other claudins increased the binding of C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE-116–319) Open table in a new tab To analyze the molecular determinants of the Cld3-CPE interaction in more detail, substitution mapping was performed. Here, peptide arrays were used that contained peptides with every possible single amino acid substitution for each position in Cld3-ECL2-(145–159) (Fig. 2). Cysteine was excluded because it leads to artificial covalent bonds during peptide synthesis. None of the substitutions at positions 145 to 147 had a considerable effect on the binding of GST-CPE-(116–319). In contrast, every substitution in the region 148NPLVP152 except V151I/L/R abolished binding of GST-CPE-(116–319). This indicates that the NPLVP motif is essential for the Cld3-CPE interaction. In addition, several substitutions at positions 154–158 also influenced the amount of GST-CPE-(116–319) bound. In particular, the introduction of negatively charged amino acids or proline at positions 154–157 strongly reduced the binding of GST-CPE-(116–319). To determine whether amino acid substitutions in ECL2 affect binding of GST-CPE-(116–319) to full-length Cld3, transfections of Cld3 in TJ-free HEK cells (21.Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C. Wiesner B. Krause G. Blasig I.E. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) were performed. Lysates of the cells were used for pull-down assays with GST-CPE-(116–319) (Fig. 3). Cld3 bound specifically to GST-CPE-(116–319) but not GST. Substitutions N148D and L150A in the ECL2 of Cld3 caused a strong reduction in the amount of Cld3 that bound to GST-CPE-(116–319). In contrast, substitutions A154N and Q155E did not affect the interaction of full-length Cld3 with GST-CPE-(116–319). Substitution E153V used to mimic a sequence element in Cld5 slightly reduced the amount of bound Cld3. Removal of the aromatic side chain of Tyr147 (Y147A), which is involved in the trans-interaction between claudins (21.Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C. Wiesner B. Krause G. Blasig I.E. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), increased the amount of Cld3 bound to GST-CPE-(116–319). To analyze the binding of CPE to Cld3 in the plasma membrane of living cells, HEK cells were transfected with Cld3wt or Cld3mutants, incubated with GST-CPE-(116–319) or GST as a control, and the presence of bound GST-CPE in cell lysates tested by Western blots. GST-CPE-(116–319) bound specifically to Cld3-transfected but not to non-transfected cells (Fig. 4, left). This binding was not clearly affected by single amino acid substitutions N148D or L150A but strongly reduced by N148D/L150A double substitution in Cld3 (Fig. 4, middle). Similar results (Fig. 4, right) were obtained with GST-CPE-(194–319), which contains a CPE fragment of which the structure has been recently solved (30.Van Itallie C.M. Betts L. Smedley 3rd, J.G. McClane B.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 268-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The binding of GST-CPE to Cld3-transfected HEK cells was also analyzed by confocal microscopy. Cld3 was detected in the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments (Fig. 5, A–C). Marked enrichment of Cld3 at contacts between two Cld3-expressing cells was observed. This enrichment is known to correspond to the formation of TJ strands (21.Piontek J. Winkler L. Wolburg H. Müller S.L. Zuleger N. Piehl C. Wiesner B. Krause G. Blasig I.E. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). No binding of GST to either Cld3 expressing or non-expressing cells was detected (Fig. 5A). In contrast, GST-CPE-(116–319) bound specifically to Cld3 expressing cells and did not bind to non-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, almost no GST-CPE-(116–319) signals were detected at the contacts between two Cld3-expressing cells, where Cld3 was strongly enriched. However, strong GST-CPE-(116–319) signals were detected on the surface of the cells outside the contacts. Similar results were obtained with GST-CPE-(194–319) (Fig. 5C). Cld3-N148D/L150A was enriched at contacts similarly to Cld3wt (Fig. 5D). This indicates that the amino acid substitutions do not alter plasma membrane targeting and ability for trans-interaction of Cld3 (21.Piontek J. W"
https://openalex.org/W2013667666,"Francisella tularensis is a highly virulent human pathogen. The most virulent strains belong to subspecies tularensis and these strains cause a sometimes fatal disease. Despite an intense recent research effort, there is very limited information available that explains the unique features of subspecies tularensis strains that distinguish them from other F. tularensis strains and that explain their high virulence. Here we report the use of targeted mutagenesis to investigate the roles of various genes or pathways for the virulence of strain SCHU S4, the type strain of subspecies tularensis.The virulence of SCHU S4 mutants was assessed by following the outcome of infection after intradermal administration of graded doses of bacteria. By this route, the LD(50) of the SCHU S4 strain is one CFU. The virulence of 20 in-frame deletion mutants and 37 transposon mutants was assessed. A majority of the mutants did not show increased prolonged time to death, among them notably Delta pyrB and Delta recA. Of the remaining, mutations in six unique targets, tolC, rep, FTT0609, FTT1149c, ahpC, and hfq resulted in significantly prolonged time to death and mutations in nine targets, rplA, wbtI, iglB, iglD, purL, purF, ggt, kdtA, and glpX, led to marked attenuation with an LD(50) of > 10(3) CFU. In fact, the latter seven mutants showed very marked attenuation with an LD(50) of > or = 10(7) CFU.The results demonstrate that the characterization of targeted mutants yielded important information about essential virulence determinants that will help to identify the so far little understood extreme virulence of F. tularensis subspecies tularensis."
https://openalex.org/W1997083516,"Staphylococcus aureus has emerged as a significant pathogen causing severe invasive disease in otherwise healthy people. Despite considerable advances in understanding the epidemiology, resistance mechanisms, and virulence factors produced by the bacteria, there is limited knowledge of the in vivo host immune response to acute, invasive S. aureus infections. Herein, we report that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with severe S. aureus infections demonstrate a distinctive and robust gene expression profile which is validated in a distinct group of patients and on a different microarray platform. Application of a systems-wide modular analysis framework reveals significant over-expression of innate immunity genes and under-expression of genes related to adaptive immunity. Simultaneous flow cytometry analyses demonstrated marked alterations in immune cell numbers, with decreased central memory CD4 and CD8 T cells and increased numbers of monocytes. CD14+ monocyte numbers significantly correlated with the gene expression levels of genes related to the innate immune response. These results demonstrate the value of applying a systems biology approach that reveals the significant alterations in the components of circulating blood lymphocytes and monocytes in invasive S. aureus infections."
https://openalex.org/W2164121022,"In natural systems plants face a plethora of antagonists and thus have evolved multiple defence strategies. Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) is a model plant for studies of inducible indirect anti-herbivore defences including the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and extrafloral nectar (EFN). In contrast, studies on direct chemical defence mechanisms as crucial components of lima beans' defence syndrome under natural conditions are nonexistent. In this study, we focus on the cyanogenic potential (HCNp; concentration of cyanogenic glycosides) as a crucial parameter determining lima beans' cyanogenesis, i.e. the release of toxic hydrogen cyanide from preformed precursors. Quantitative variability of cyanogenesis in a natural population of wild lima bean in Mexico was significantly correlated with missing leaf area. Since existing correlations do not by necessity mean causal associations, the function of cyanogenesis as efficient plant defence was subsequently analysed in feeding trials. We used natural chrysomelid herbivores and clonal lima beans with known cyanogenic features produced from field-grown mother plants. We show that in addition to extensively investigated indirect defences, cyanogenesis has to be considered as an important direct defensive trait affecting lima beans' overall defence in nature. Our results indicate the general importance of analysing ‘multiple defence syndromes’ rather than single defence mechanisms in future functional analyses of plant defences."

https://openalex.org/W2041351622,"ACSL1 (acyl-CoA synthetase 1), the major acyl-CoA synthetase of adipocytes, has been proposed to function in adipocytes as mediating free fatty acid influx, esterification, and storage as triglyceride. To test this hypothesis, ACSL1 was stably silenced (knockdown (kd)) in 3T3-L1 cells, differentiated into adipocytes, and evaluated for changes in lipid metabolism. Surprisingly, ACSL1-silenced adipocytes exhibited no significant changes in basal or insulin-stimulated long-chain fatty acid uptake, lipid droplet size, or tri-, di-, or monoacylglycerol levels when compared with a control adipocyte line. However, ACSL1 kd adipocytes displayed a 7-fold increase in basal and a approximately 15% increase in forskolin-stimulated fatty acid efflux without any change in glycerol release, indicating a role for the protein in fatty acid reesterification following lipolysis. Consistent with this proposition, ACSL1 kd cells exhibited a decrease in activation and phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase and its primary substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Moreover, ACSL1 kd adipocytes displayed an increase in phosphorylated protein kinase C and phosphorylated JNK, attenuated insulin signaling, and a decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. These findings identify a primary role of ACSL1 in adipocytes not in control of lipid influx, as previously considered, but in lipid efflux and fatty acid-induced insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2068079108,"Potassium-chloride co-transporter 2 (KCC2) activity is known to be attenuated by neural injury. Hershfinkel et al. show that KCC2 activity is inhibited by intracellular free zinc, a component of neuronal injury signaling pathways. Oxygen-glucose deprivation results in attenuation of KCC2 activity that is reversible by intracellular zinc chelation. We found that K+/Cl− co-transporter 2 (KCC2) activity, monitored with wide-field fluorescence, was inhibited by intracellular Zn2+, a major component of neuronal injury. Zn2+-mediated KCC2 inhibition produced a depolarizing shift of GABAA reversal potentials in rat cortical neurons. Moreover, oxygen-glucose deprivation attenuated KCC2 activity in a Zn2+-dependent manner. The link between Zn2+ and KCC2 activity provides a previously unknown target for neuroprotection and may be important in activity-dependent regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2042042962,"By sensing changes in one or few environmental factors biological systems can anticipate future changes in multiple factors over a wide range of time scales (daily to seasonal). This anticipatory behavior is important to the fitness of diverse species, and in context of the diurnal cycle it is overall typical of eukaryotes and some photoautotrophic bacteria but is yet to be observed in archaea. Here, we report the first observation of light-dark (LD)-entrained diurnal oscillatory transcription in up to 12% of all genes of a halophilic archaeon Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1. Significantly, the diurnally entrained transcription was observed under constant darkness after removal of the LD stimulus (free-running rhythms). The memory of diurnal entrainment was also associated with the synchronization of oxic and anoxic physiologies to the LD cycle. Our results suggest that under nutrient limited conditions halophilic archaea take advantage of the causal influence of sunlight (via temperature) on O2 diffusivity in a closed hypersaline environment to streamline their physiology and operate oxically during nighttime and anoxically during daytime."
https://openalex.org/W2031767983,"ABCA12 (ATP binding cassette transporter, family 12) is a cellular membrane transporter that facilitates the delivery of glucosylceramides to epidermal lamellar bodies in keratinocytes, a process that is critical for permeability barrier formation. Following secretion of lamellar bodies into the stratum corneum, glucosylceramides are metabolized to ceramides, which comprise ∼50% of the lipid in stratum corneum. Gene mutations of <i>ABCA12</i> underlie harlequin ichthyosis, a devastating skin disorder characterized by abnormal lamellar bodies and a severe barrier abnormality. Recently we reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and liver X receptor activators increase ABCA12 expression in human keratinocytes. Here we demonstrate that ceramide (C<sub>2</sub>-Cer and C<sub>6</sub>-Cer), but not C<sub>8</sub>-glucosylceramides, sphingosine, or ceramide 1-phosphate, increases ABCA12 mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase, sphingomyelin synthase, and ceramidase and small interfering RNA knockdown of human alkaline ceramidase, which all increase endogenous ceramide levels, also increased ABCA12 mRNA levels. Moreover, simultaneous treatment with C<sub>6</sub>-Cer and each of these same inhibitors additively increased ABCA12 expression, indicating that ceramide is an important inducer of ABCA12 expression and that the conversion of ceramide to other sphingolipids or metabolites is not required. Finally, both exogenous and endogenous ceramides preferentially stimulate PPARδ expression (but not other PPARs or liver X receptors), whereas PPARδ knockdown by siRNA transfection specifically diminished the ceramide-induced increase in ABCA12 mRNA levels, indicating that PPARδ is a mediator of the ceramide effect. Together, these results show that ceramide, an important lipid component of epidermis, up-regulates ABCA12 expression via the PPARδ-mediated signaling pathway, providing a substrate-driven, feed-forward mechanism for regulating this key lipid transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1971564731,"DNA damage in Escherichia coli evokes a response mechanism called the SOS response. The genetic circuit of this mechanism includes the genes recA and lexA, which regulate each other via a mixed feedback loop involving transcriptional regulation and protein-protein interaction. Under normal conditions, recA is transcriptionally repressed by LexA, which also functions as an auto-repressor. In presence of DNA damage, RecA proteins recognize stalled replication forks and participate in the DNA repair process. Under these conditions, RecA marks LexA for fast degradation. Generally, such mixed feedback loops are known to exhibit either bi-stability or a single steady state. However, when the dynamics of the SOS system following DNA damage was recently studied in single cells, ordered peaks were observed in the promoter activity of both genes (Friedman et al., 2005, PLoS Biol. 3(7):e238). This surprising phenomenon was masked in previous studies of cell populations. Previous attempts to explain these results harnessed additional genes to the system and deployed complex deterministic mathematical models that were only partially successful in explaining the results.Here we apply stochastic methods, which are better suited for dynamic simulations of single cells. We show that a simple model, involving only the basic components of the circuit, is sufficient to explain the peaks in the promoter activities of recA and lexA. Notably, deterministic simulations of the same model do not produce peaks in the promoter activities.We conclude that the double negative mixed feedback loop with auto-repression accounts for the experimentally observed peaks in the promoter activities. In addition to explaining the experimental results, this result shows that including additional regulations in a mixed feedback loop may dramatically change the dynamic functionality of this regulatory module. Furthermore, our results suggests that stochastic fluctuations strongly affect the qualitative behavior of important regulatory modules even under biologically relevant conditions, thus emphasizing the importance of stochastic analysis of regulatory circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2065951617,"Background There is a major discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo results regarding the role of β1 integrins in the maintenance of epidermal stem/progenitor cells. Studies of mice with skin-specific ablation of β1 integrins suggested that epidermis can form and be maintained in their absence, while in vitro data have shown a fundamental role for these adhesion receptors in stem/progenitor cell expansion and differentiation. Methodology/Principal Findings To elucidate this discrepancy we generated hypomorphic mice expressing reduced β1 integrin levels on keratinocytes that developed similar, but less severe defects than mice with β1-deficient keratinocytes. Surprisingly we found that upon aging these abnormalities attenuated due to a rapid expansion of cells, which escaped or compensated for the down-regulation of β1 integrin expression. A similar phenomenon was observed in aged mice with a complete, skin-specific ablation of the β1 integrin gene, where cells that escaped Cre-mediated recombination repopulated the mutant skin in a very short time period. The expansion of β1 integrin expressing keratinocytes was even further accelerated in situations of increased keratinocyte proliferation such as wound healing. Conclusions/Significance These data demonstrate that expression of β1 integrins is critically important for the expansion of epidermal progenitor cells to maintain epidermal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2019808522,"Background “Imaging genetics” studies have shown that brain function by neuroimaging is a sensitive intermediate phenotype that bridges the gap between genes and psychiatric conditions. Although the evidence of association between functional val108/158met polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT) and increasing risk for developing schizophrenia from genetic association studies remains to be elucidated, one of the most topical findings from imaging genetics studies is the association between COMT genotype and prefrontal function in schizophrenia. The next important step in the translational approach is to establish a useful neuroimaging tool in clinical settings that is sensitive to COMT variation, so that the clinician could use the index to predict clinical response such as improvement in cognitive dysfunction by medication. Here, we investigated spatiotemporal characteristics of the association between prefrontal hemodynamic activation and the COMT genotype using a noninvasive neuroimaging technique, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Methodology/Principal Findings Study participants included 45 patients with schizophrenia and 60 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Signals that are assumed to reflect regional cerebral blood volume were monitored over prefrontal regions from 52-channel NIRS and compared between two COMT genotype subgroups (Met carriers and Val/Val individuals) matched for age, gender, premorbid IQ, and task performance. The [oxy-Hb] increase in the Met carriers during the verbal fluency task was significantly greater than that in the Val/Val individuals in the frontopolar prefrontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia, although neither medication nor clinical symptoms differed significantly between the two subgroups. These differences were not found to be significant in healthy controls. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that the prefrontal NIRS signals can noninvasively detect the impact of COMT variation in patients with schizophrenia. NIRS may be a promising candidate translational approach in psychiatric neuroimaging."

Strikingly, positional cloning of the recessive mutation fragilitas ossium in mice identified a deletion in the gene that encodes neutral SMase 2, leading to the complete loss of neutral SMase activity (23Aubin I. Adams C.P. Opsahl S. Septier D. Bishop C.E. Auge N. Salvayre R. Negre-Salvayre A. Goldberg M. Guénet J.L. Poirier C. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 803-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).

They transfected MCF-7 cells with B. cereus SMase targeted to various subcellular organelles, but they observed cytochrome c release and apoptosis induction only when the enzyme was targeted to the mitochondria. Ceramide activated the mitochondrial protein phosphatase 2A, which dephosphorylated Bcl-2 and led to apoptosis (29Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol.

The permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane correlates directly with the level of ceramide in the membrane (31Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The concentration of ceramide at which significant channel formation occurs is consistent with the level of mitochondrial ceramide that occurs during the induction phase of apoptosis (31Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In isolated mitochondria, ceramide can also form membrane channels large enough to release cytochrome c and other small proteins (32Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. J. Biol.

These observations suggest the existence of a mitochondrial pool of sphingomyelin and the function of a sphingomyelin-specific metabolic pathway in mitochondria. However, no SMase has been identified in mitochondria.We identified and examined the biochemical properties of a novel SMase localized to the zebrafish mitochondrion. The enzyme was cloned from a cDNA library of embryonic zebrafish cells. It was found to regulate mitochondrial ceramide levels.DISCUSSIONA novel mitochondrial SMase was cloned, and the active endogenous enzyme was purified from ZE cells. The purified enzyme showed specific activity against [14C]sphingomyelin in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+ at pH 7.5. Cytoimmunostaining revealed that the enzyme was localized to the mitochondrion, and subcellular fractionation indicated that the enzyme was distributed in the mitochondrial fraction. A protease protection assay revealed that the enzyme was distributed in the intermembrane space and/or the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. The overexpression of wild-type and mutant proteins showed that an MLS was required for translocation of the enzyme to the mitochondrion. Mutants lacking this MLS were instead directed to the cytoplasm. Cytostaining for zebrafish SMase in ZE cells indicated that the enzyme was co-localized with MitoTracker Red and HSP60 in the mitochondrion. The transient and stable overexpression of mitochondrial SMase cDNA in HEK293 cells resulted in enhanced neutral SMase activity and increased ceramide levels paralleled by reduced sphingomyelin levels. Antisense oligonucleotide-induced SMase deficiency confirmed that SMase was required for mitochondrial ceramide generation. Therefore, the identified zebrafish SMase is a novel mitochondrial SMase that regulates mitochondrial ceramide production.The activity and substrate specificity of this novel enzyme are similar to those of the known mammalian neutral SMase 2s (7Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 16Marchesini N. Osta W. Bielawski J. Luberto C. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J.

The purified zebrafish SMase showed specific hydrolyzing activity against sphingomyelin, producing ceramide, although it showed no activity against phosphatidylcholine. In addition, the enzyme regulated the metabolism of sphingomyelin and ceramide in cells. When SMase was overexpressed in cultured cells, we observed decreases in sphingomyelin and corresponding increases in ceramide levels in the mitochondrial fraction. Thus, the zebrafish enzyme is a typical Mg2+-dependent neutral SMase that accelerates the catabolism of sphingomyelin in the mitochondrion.The previously purified bovine brain neutral SMase, the partially purified rat brain neutral SMase, yeast Isc1p, and mouse neutral SMase 2 showed dependence upon anionic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine for in vitro activity (14Marchesini N.

Interestingly, site-directed mutagenesis in Isc1p indicated the importance of positively charged C-terminal amino acid residues in protein-anionic phospholipid interaction (52Okamoto Y. Vaena de Avalos S. Hannun Y.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7855-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The zebrafish SMase described here was also activated by cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine, similar to mammalian SMase 2 (7Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine are highly enriched in the outer and inner membranes of the mitochondrion. Therefore, cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine may be a candidate for the activator of mitochondrial SMase.Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on amino acid sequences showed that the zebrafish mitochondrial SMase falls into a cluster consisting of human, mouse, and zebrafish neutral SMase 2s. Both zebrafish mitochondrial SMase and SMase 2 share common structural features, such as a magnesium-binding site, a substrate-binding site, and an active center His residue (Fig. 1B). We found that the mitochondrial SMase also possesses an MLS and a transmembrane domain as a stop-transfer sequence in the N-terminal region. This MLS was also conserved in other SMase 2 enzymes, suggesting that all known SMase 2s and zebrafish mitochondrial SMase may be mitochondrial enzymes.In eukaryotes, the MLS has been identified in the majority of pre-sequences cleaved by mitochondrial processing peptidases. This signal sequence is characterized by an overall positive charge, a predicted ability to form an amphiphilic α-helix, and the presence of an Arg residue at the −2 or −3 position from the cleavage site (53Gakh O. Cavadini P. Isaya G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Four cleavage site motifs have been identified (54Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 4: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) as follows: XRX↓X(S/X) (R-2 motif); XRXl(Y/X)↓(S/A/X)X (R-3 motif); XRX↓(F/L/I)XX(S/T/G)XXXX (R-10 motif); and XX↓X(S/X) (R-none motif). The identified zebrafish mitochondrial SMase was consistent with the R-3 motif (i.e. DRLI↓AV).Hoffman et al. (7Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) first identified that mammalian neutral SMase 2 was localized in the Golgi in a number of cell lines by immunofluorescent staining. Tani and Hannun (15Tani M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10047-10056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported that mouse neutral SMase 2 was palmitoylated at four Cys residues (Cys-53, Cys-54, Cys-395, and Cys-396) that were localized to the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. Zebrafish neutral SMase 2 also showed three conserved Cys residues (Cys-53, Cys-421, and Cys-422), but zebrafish mitochondrial SMase showed no palmitoylated Cys cluster. This work suggests that in contrast to zebrafish mitochondrial SMase, neutral SMase 2 might be localized to the cell membrane as a result of palmitoylation. Further studies of the intracellular localization of SMase 2 are required to examine whether SMase 2 and mitochondrial SMase are co-localized in the mitochondrion.Based on an analysis of gene synteny between zebrafish and human genomes, mtSMase is located on zebrafish chromosome 16. The ortholog of mtSMase is found on chromosome 8 of the human genome and is expressed in human breast tumors (55Dias Neto E. Correa R.G. Verjovski-Almeida S. Briones M.R. Nagai M.A. da Silva Jr., W.

In contrast, the nSMase 2 is located on zebrafish chromosome 25 and was orthologous to the neutral SMase 2 gene SMPD3 located on human chromosome 16. Therefore, in terms of gene synteny, the isolated zebrafish mitochondrial SMase is distinct from other neutral SMase 2s.At least five SMases, i.e. acidic SMase, neutral SMase 1, SMase 2, SMase 3, and mitochondrial SMase, have been characterized in mammalian and other animal cells, and all of these enzymes were expressed in ZE cells. 3T. Yabu and M. Yamashita, unpublished data. Thus, ZE cells represent an important model for characterizing the precise roles of mitochondrial and other types of SMases, as well as the mechanism of ceramide signaling. Our results indicate that mitochondrial SMase has a specific function in mitochondrial ceramide generation.Previous studies have demonstrated that ceramidase (34El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T.

https://openalex.org/W2077522176,"The transcription factor Nrf2 is the master regulator of a cellular defense mechanism against environmental insults. The Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response is accomplished by the transcription of a battery of genes that encode phase II detoxifying enzymes, xenobiotic transporters, and antioxidants. Coordinated expression of these genes is critical in protecting cells from toxic and carcinogenic insults and in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Activation of the Nrf2 pathway is primarily controlled by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which is a molecular switch that turns on or off the Nrf2 signaling pathway according to intracellular redox conditions. Here we report our finding of a novel Nrf2 suppressor ectodermal-neural cortex 1 (ENC1), which is a BTB-Kelch protein and belongs to the same family as Keap1. Transient expression of ENC1 reduced steady-state levels of Nrf2 and its downstream gene expression. Although ENC1 interacted with Keap1 indirectly, the ENC1-mediated down-regulation of Nrf2 was independent of Keap1. The negative effect of ENC1 on Nrf2 was not due to a change in the stability of Nrf2 because neither proteasomal nor lysosomal inhibitors had any effects. Overexpression of ENC1 did not result in a change in the level of Nrf2 mRNA, rather, it caused a decrease in the rate of Nrf2 protein synthesis. These results demonstrate that ENC1 functions as a negative regulator of Nrf2 through suppressing Nrf2 protein translation, which adds another level of complexity in controlling the Nrf2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2006071979,"Permeases belonging to the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family promote uptake of nucleosides and/or nucleobases into a wide range of eukaryotes and mediate the uptake of a variety of drugs used in the treatment of cancer, heart disease, AIDS, and parasitic infections. No experimental three-dimensional structure exists for any of these permeases, and they are not present in prokaryotes, the source of many membrane proteins used in crystal structure determination. To generate a structural model for such a transporter, the LdNT1.1 nucleoside permease from the parasitic protozoan Leishmania donovani was modeled using ab initio computation. Site-directed mutations that strongly impair transport or that alter substrate specificity map to the central pore of the ab initio model, whereas mutations that have less pronounced phenotypes map to peripheral positions. The model suggests that aromatic residues present in transmembrane helices 1, 2, and 7 may interact to form an extracellular gate that closes the permeation pathway in the inward oriented conformation. Mutation of two of these three residues abrogated transport activity, consistent with the prediction of the model. The ab initio model is similar to one derived previously using threading analysis, a distinct computational approach, supporting the overall accuracy of both models. However, significant differences in helix orientation and residue position between the two models are apparent, and the mutagenesis data suggest that the ab initio model represents an improvement regarding structural details over the threading model. The putative gating interaction may also help explain differences in substrate specificity between members of this family."
https://openalex.org/W2074032055,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been extensively studied because of their functional attributes in development and diseases. However, relatively few in vivo functional studies have been reported on the roles of MMPs in postembryonic organ development. Amphibian metamorphosis is a unique model for studying MMP function during vertebrate development because of its dependence on thyroid hormone (T3) and the ability to easily manipulate this process with exogenous T3. The MMP stromelysin-3 (ST3) is induced by T3, and its expression correlates with cell death during metamorphosis. We have previously shown that ST3 is both necessary and sufficient for larval epithelial cell death in the remodeling intestine. To investigate the roles of ST3 in other organs and especially on different cell types, we have analyzed the effect of transgenic overexpression of ST3 in the tail of premetamorphic tadpoles. We report for the first time that ST3 expression, in the absence of T3, caused significant muscle cell death in the tail of premetamorphic transgenic tadpoles. On the other hand, only relatively low levels of epidermal cell death were induced by precocious ST3 expression in the tail, contrasting what takes place during natural and T3-induced metamorphosis when ST3 expression is high. This cell type-specific apoptotic response to ST3 in the tail suggests distinct mechanisms regulating cell death in different tissues. Furthermore, our analyses of laminin receptor, an in vivo substrate of ST3 in the intestine, suggest that laminin receptor cleavage may be an underlying mechanism for the cell type-specific effects of ST3.

Organ culture studies on intestinal remodeling have directly substantiated an essential role of ST3 in larval epithelial cell death and ECM remodeling (32.Ishizuya-Oka A. Li Q. Amano T. Damjanovski S. Ueda S. Shi Y.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1177-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, precocious expression of ST3 alone in premetamorphic tadpoles through transgenesis is sufficient to induce ECM remodeling and larval epithelial apoptosis in the tadpole intestine (33.Fu L.

Thus, ST3 appears to be necessary and sufficient for intestinal epithelial cell death during metamorphosis. ST3 was first isolated as a breast cancer-associated gene (34.Basset P. Bellocq J.P.

Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, compared with other MMPs, ST3 has only weak activities toward ECM proteins in vitro but stronger activities against non-ECM proteins like α1 proteinase inhibitor and IGFBP-1 (44.Murphy G.

Although ST3 may cleave ECM proteins strongly in the in vivo environment, these findings suggest that the cleavage of non-ECM proteins is likely important for its biological roles. Consistently, we have recently identified a cell surface receptor, laminin receptor (LR) as an in vivo substrate of ST3 in the tadpole intestine during metamorphosis (47.Amano T. Kwak O. Fu L. Marshak A. Shi Y.B. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 48.Amano T. Fu L. Marshak A. Kwak O. Shi Y.B. Dev.

Analyses of LR expression and cleavage suggest that LR cleavage by ST3 is likely an important mechanism by which ST3 regulates the interaction between the larval epithelial cells and the ECM to induce cell death during intestinal remodeling (47.Amano T. Kwak O. Fu L. Marshak A. Shi Y.B. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 48.Amano T. Fu L. Marshak A. Kwak O. Shi Y.B. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, to investigate the role of ST3 in the apoptosis in other tissues during metamorphosis and whether LR cleavage serves as a mechanism for ST3 to regulate the fate of different cell types, we have analyzed the effects of precocious expression of ST3 in premetamorphic tadpole tail. The tail offers an opportunity to examine the effects of ST3 on different cell types. The epidermis, the fast and slow muscles, and the connective tissue underlying the epidermis in the myotendinous junctions and surrounding the notochord constitute the major tissue types in tail (50.Das B. Schreiber A.M. Huang H. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 12230-12235Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Even though death is the destiny of all these cell types, it is not clear whether they all die through similar or different mechanisms. Microscopic and histochemical analyses have shown that at least the muscle and epidermal cells undergo T3-dependent apoptosis during metamorphosis (23.Yoshizato K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1989; 119: 97-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 29.Damjanovski S. Ishizuya-Oka A. Shi Y.B. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 51.Kerr J.F.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). To study whether ST3 regulates apoptosis of these two cell types, we have made use of the transgenic animals that express a transgenic ST3 under the control of a heat shock-inducible promoter (33.Fu L. Ishizuya-Oka A. Buchholz D.R. Amano T. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27856-27865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We show that whereas extensive apoptosis is present in both the epidermis and muscles during natural as well as T3-induced metamorphosis, transgenic expression of ST3 induces cell death predominantly in the muscles. Furthermore, we show that LR is expressed in the epidermis and connective tissue but not in muscles of the tadpole tail. More importantly, LR cleavage products are present in the tail during natural metamorphosis but not in transgenic tadpoles overexpressing ST3. These results suggest that ST3 has distinct effects on the epidermis and muscles in the tail, possibly because of the tissue-specific expression and function of LR. Wild type Xenopus laevis tadpoles were purchased from Nasco. Transgenic animals and their wild type siblings were obtained by mating parental lines generated as previously described, and the transgenic animals were identified by the expression of GFP in the lens of their eyes (33.Fu L.

Wild type and transgenic tadpoles were heat-shocked twice at 34 °C for 30 min, separated by 30 min at 18 °C (33.Fu L. Ishizuya-Oka A. Buchholz D.R. Amano T. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. J. Biol.

Dev. 2002; 62: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The animals were maintained at room temperature throughout the experiment (about 18–21 °C). The transgenic animals were identified under a UV dissecting microscope with a chroma filter set for GFP expression in the eyes of transgenic but not wild type animals. For T3 treatment, stage 54 premetamorphic tadpoles were treated with 5 nm for 3 days. All animal studies were approved by National Institutes of Health NICHD Animal Use and Care Committee. Total RNA was isolated from wild type and transgenic tadpoles as described previously (54.Buchholz D.R. Tomita A. Fu L. Paul B.D. Shi Y.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9026-9037Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 55.Shi Y.B. Liang V.C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The RNA was made DNA-free by treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) to remove any DNA contamination and repurified with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For cDNA synthesis, 100 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions for the High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems), and 4 μl of each cDNA was used for qPCR analysis. The standard samples to produce a standard curve for qPCR analysis was made from mixed total RNA isolated from tadpoles of all stages encompassing the entire metamorphosing period and was reverse-transcribed at a higher concentration (1 μg of total RNA in a 20-μl reaction). The cDNA was diluted at series of 1:2 or 1:3 to cover the whole range of the tested samples. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was carried out to quantify gene expression with ABI 7000 (Applied Biosciences) as described previously (33.Fu L. Ishizuya-Oka A. Buchholz D.R. Amano T. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27856-27865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For detection of both the endogenous ST3 and the ST3-GFP transgene, forward primer 5′-GTGGTCGAAATCGTCAGAAACG-3′, reverse primer 5′-CGGATGATCTTGTACGTCAGGTT-3′, and probe 5′-ACGCTGGGACAAGACA-3′ (Assay-by-Design, Applied Biosystems) in the ST3 coding region were used. A set of primer/probe specific for rpL8 was used as a control for RNA input of each sample, and the expression level of the gene of interest within each sample was normalized to that of rpL8 (33.Fu L.

Tadpole tails were isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 4 h at room temperature. The tissues were then rinsed in PBS and transferred to 70% ethanol and processed in a tissue processor (Thermo Shandon) for histological analysis. Paraffin sections were cut at 7 μm and placed on Fisher Probe-On charged slides. Sections were processed for TUNEL assay. Slides were refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and then rinsed in PBS. Permeabilization of sections was done with 20 μg/ml protease K in 10 nm Tris, pH 8, for 10 min at room temperature. After rinsing the sections with PBS, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched for 20 min with 3% H2O2 in 90% methanol. The TUNEL reaction with or without terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) was carried out at 37 °C for 90 min in TdT buffer (Oncogene), 0.04 mm dUTP (Roche Applied Science), and 0.3 units/μl TdT (Invitrogen). Then the sections were rinsed in PBS, blocked for 10 min with 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with ABC Elite Ready-To-Use solution (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). After 30 min, antibody binding was detected with a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine staining kit (Vector). The sections are counter-stained with methyl green (Sigma). A partial cDNA encoding GFP was obtained by PCR with pCGCG (53.Fu L. Buchholz D. Shi Y.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2002; 62: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) as the template with the primers 5′-GAACTTTTCACTGGAGTTGTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGGCCATCGCCAATTGGAG-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. To synthesize antisense RNA probe, these plasmids were linearized with BamH1 and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). In situ hybridization on frozen tissue sections was performed as described (33.Fu L. Ishizuya-Oka A. Buchholz D.R. Amano T. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. J. Biol.

Marshak A. Kwak O. Shi Y.B. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated with a 1/10,000 dilution of anti-Xenopus LR antibody (48.Amano T. Fu L. Marshak A. Kwak O. Shi Y.B. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 234: 190-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham BiosciencesTM ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System). For immunohistochemistry, the tail was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS at room temperature for 4 h. The tissues were then rinsed in PBS and transferred to 70% ethanol and processed in a tissue processor (Thermo Shandon) for histological analysis. Cross-sections were cut at 7 μm and placed on Fisher Probe-On charged slides. Paraffin sections (7 μm) were incubated with 1/4,000 dilution of the anti-Xenopus LR antibody in combination with ABC elite kit (Vector) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine for detection. We have previously generated transgenic animals expressing a ST3-GFP fusion transgene under the control of heat shock-inducible promoter by using a double promoter construct, where the second promoter, γ-crystallin promoter, drives the expression of GFP in the animal eye for easy identification of transgenic animals (33.Fu L. Ishizuya-Oka A. Buchholz D.R. Amano T. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27856-27865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine the relative expression levels of the transgenic ST3 upon heat shock treatment, we carried out a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis using a primer/probe set, specific for both the transgenic ST3-GFP and the endogenous ST3. Tail RNA was isolated from stage 54 premetamorphic (when there is little or no T3) wild type and transgenic tadpoles treated with or without heat shock treatment for the indicated number of days and analyzed by qPCR for ST3 mRNA levels. For comparison, we also analyzed tail RNA from tadpoles at the climax of natural metamorphosis (stage 62, when endogenous T3 is at peak levels) or stage 54 premetamorphic tadpoles that were induced to metamorphose with T3 treatment (Fig. 1). Endogenous ST3 mRNA was expressed only in tadpoles undergoing natural metamorphosis (stage 62) or after T3 treatment (Fig. 1). Transgenic ST3 mRNA was expressed after 1–7 days of heat shock treatment, and its expression levels were a few folds higher than those of endogenous ST3 at stage 62, the climax of metamorphosis. The transgene expression attained a peak at 4 days of heat shock treatment for unknown reasons, but this is similar to the expression pattern observed in the intestine (33.Fu L. Ishizuya-Oka A. Buchholz D.R. Amano T. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27856-27865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It should be pointed out that although the ST3 transgene was expressed at much higher levels compared with endogenous ST3 in premetamorphic tadpole tail (e.g. stage 54). Endogenous ST3 is expressed at high levels by stage 62 when tail resorption begins and reaches even higher levels in the tail at later stages. The endogenous ST3 expression in the tail at stage 63 is severalfold higher than that at stage 62 (see Fig. 8A) and, thus, is comparable with that observed in the transgenic animals. The heat shock-inducible promoter is expected to drive ubiquitous gene expression. To determine the expression profile of ST3-GFP transgene in the tail after heat shock treatment, in situ hybridization was carried out with the GFP probe. As expected, there were no detectable signals from the tail of premetamorphic wild type tadpoles with or without heat shock treatment (data not shown) or from transgenic tadpoles without heat shock treatment (Fig. 2A). Upon heat shock treatment, ST3-GFP expression was ubiquitous in the tail of transgenic tadpoles (Fig. 2, B–D). It should be pointed out that endogenous ST3 is expressed only in the connective tissue during natural or T3-induced metamorphosis (29.Damjanovski S. Ishizuya-Oka A. Shi Y.B. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30.Berry D.L. Schwartzman R.A. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ST3 is a secreted enzyme, and thus, ubiquitously expressed transgenic ST3 in the tail should be secreted into the same extracellular milieu within the tail as the endogenous fibroblast-expressed ST3. Expression studies have shown that during metamorphosis, endogenous ST3 is expressed in the fibroblastic cells underneath the dying epidermis and surrounding the muscle fibers in the tail (29.Damjanovski S. Ishizuya-Oka A. Shi Y.B. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 91-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30.Berry D.L. Schwartzman R.A. Brown D.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of ST3 in T3-induced apoptosis of the epidermal and muscle cells. To investigate this possibility, we heat-shocked transgenic and wild type tadpoles at premetamorphic stage 54, i.e. before any expression of endogenous ST3, to induce transgene expression in transgenic animals. Extended heat shock treatment caused no obvious external morphological changes in either the wild type or transgenic animals (data not shown and Ref. 33.Fu L. Ishizuya-Oka A. Buchholz D.R. Amano T. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27856-27865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After 4 days of heat shock treatment, the tail was isolated and subjected to TUNEL assay to detect apoptotic cells. In the transgenic animals, apoptotic cells were mainly detected in the muscle region, whereas relatively few apoptotic cells were detected in the epidermal region (Fig. 3, B and b). Few or no apoptotic cells were detected in wild type tadpoles after heat shock treatment (Fig. 3, A and a). Quantitative analysis revealed that there were significant numbers of apoptotic cells in the muscle region of transgenic tadpoles compared with the those in the wild type (Fig. 3C), although the increase in the apoptotic signal in the epidermal region was not statistically significant in the transgenic animals compared with wild type ones (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that ST3 expression leads to the precocious apoptosis in the tail as in the case of intestine (33.Fu L. Ishizuya-Oka A. Buchholz D.R. Amano T. Matsuda H. Shi Y.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27856-27865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but cell death occurred predominantly in the muscles of the tail."
https://openalex.org/W2056101310,"The activity of ERK2, an essential component of MAP-kinase pathway, is under the strict control of various effector proteins. Despite numerous efforts, no crystal structure of ERK2 complexed with such partners has been obtained so far. PTP-SL is a major regulator of ERK2 activity. To investigate the ERK2-PTP-SL complex we used a combined method based on cross-linking, MALDI-TOF analysis, isothermal titration calorimetry, molecular modeling and docking. Hence, new insights into the stoichiometry, thermodynamics and interacting regions of the complex are obtained and a structural model of ERK2-PTP-SL complex in a state consistent with PTP-SL phosphatase activity is developed incorporating all the experimental constraints available at hand to date. According to this model, part of the N-terminal region of PTP-SL has propensity for intrinsic disorder and becomes structured within the complex with ERK2. The proposed model accounts for the structural basis of several experimental findings such as the complex-dissociating effect of ATP, or PTP-SL blocking effect on the ERK2 export to the nucleus. A general observation emerging from this model is that regions involved in substrate binding in PTP-SL and ERK2, respectively are interacting within the interface of the complex."

https://openalex.org/W2029207245,"In the pituitary gland, activated protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms accumulate either selectively at the cell-cell contact (α and ϵ) or at the entire plasma membrane (β1 and δ). The molecular mechanisms underlying these various subcellular locations are not known. Here, we demonstrate the existence within PKCϵ of a cell-cell contact targeting sequence (3CTS) that, upon stimulation, is capable of targeting PKCδ, chimerin-α1, and the PKCϵ C1 domain to the cell-cell contact. We show that this selective targeting of PKCϵ is lost upon overexpression of 3CTS fused to a (R-Ahx-R)4 (where Ahx is 6-aminohexanoic acid) vectorization peptide, reflecting a dominant-negative effect of the overexpressed 3CTS on targeting selectivity. 3CTS contains a putative amphipathic α-helix, a 14-3-3-binding site, and the Glu-374 amino acid, involved in targeting selectivity. We show that the integrity of the α-helix is important for translocation but that 14-3-3 is not involved in targeting selectivity. However, PKCϵ translocation is increased when PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction is abolished, suggesting that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate activation may initiate two sets of PKCϵ functions, those depending on 14-3-3 and those depending on translocation to cell-cell contacts.

Activated PKCα and -ϵ accumulate selectively at cell-cell contacts, whereas PKCβ1 and -δ are detected along the entire plasma membrane. The selective partitioning of specific PKC isoforms at cell-cell contacts is not restricted to the GH3B6 cell line. It was also observed in blastocysts (12.Pauken C.M. Capco D.G. Mol. Reprod.

Although the molecular mechanism underlying this partitioning remains largely unknown, an interesting clue was provided by the discovery in human pituitary and thyroid tumors of a natural PKCα D294G mutant (18.Alvaro V.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3351-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A similar loss of selectivity is found when an E374G mutation is introduced in PKCϵ (11.Quittau-Prévostel C. Delaunay N. Collazos A. Vallentin A. Joubert D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), indicating that the Asp-294 and Glu-374 amino acids located within the V3 region of PKCα and ϵ, respectively, are essential for proper targeting after activation. Interestingly, the PKCα D294G mutant was also shown to be a loss-of-function mutant (21.Zhu Y. Dong Q. Tan B.J. Lim W.G. Zhou S. Duan W. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4520-4524Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, because replacing Phe by Glu in the corresponding position does not induce the targeting of PKCδ to the cell-cell contact, it is likely that other amino acids are required for cell-cell contact targeting selectivity. In the present work, we sought to deepen our understanding of the requirements for efficient targeting to the cell-cell contact by focusing our analysis on the sequence surrounding position Asp-294 of PKCα and Glu-374 of PKCϵ. On the basis of isoform sequence comparison, we identified a 20-aa stretch in the V3 region of PKCϵ that includes Glu-374 and contains one of the two 14-3-3-binding sites of PKCϵ and a putative amphipathic α-helix. This 20-aa module fulfills the criteria of a cell-cell contact targeting sequence, and we therefore propose to name this sequence 3CTS.

Parker (Protein Phosphorylation Laboratory, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, WC2A 3PX, UK). The plasmid containing the full-length PKCγ was generously provided by Dr. N. Saito (Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Biosignal Research Center, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan). Monoclonal anti-pan14-3-3 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and polyclonal anti-PKCϵ used in Western blotting was from Euromedex. Mouse monoclonal anti-PKCϵ used for immunoprecipitation experiments was purchased from Pharmingen. Mouse monoclonal anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Anti-pSer antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Experimental procedures and primer sequences are described in the supplementary “Experimental Procedures”. Two peptides were synthesized using standard automated solid-phase N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)/tert-butyl chemistry and purified on a reverse phase HPLC C18 column to 98% purity. Their molecular weight was checked by mass spectrometry. The vector peptide H-Ahx-R-Ahx-RR-Ahx-RR-Ahx-RR-Ahx-R-NH2 was coupled to the C terminus of 3CTS or a scramble peptide, with both peptides including 3 additional aa of the PKCϵ sequence (to maintain a distance between Glu-374 and the vector peptide) and a cysteine to allow the chemical reaction for the linkage with the peptide vector. Rhodamine B (RhoB) was added to the N terminus of both constructs, yielding a RhoB-LKELENNIRKALSFDNRGEEHRA-C-vector peptide (for 3CTS) or a RhoB-GEHDFLKERLKNIREAESNRLAN-C-vector peptide complex (scramble peptide). Coupling of the vector peptide with the other peptides was achieved in a one-pot two-step reaction using the heterobifunctional linker N-succinimidyl 3-maleimidopropionate (Fluka 63179) in dry N,N-dimethylformamide, in the presence of N,N-diisopropylethylamine. The N-terminal function of the vector peptide was first reacted, resulting in maleimidopropionyl-GPS1168. Addition of either 3CTS or the control peptide resulted in the formation of a thioether linkage between the thiol of their cysteine and the maleimide moiety. The progression of each step of the coupling process was monitored by analytic reverse phase C18 HPLC. The resulting coupling products were purified to 98% on a reverse phase C18 HPLC column, aliquoted, and lyophilized. For immunoprecipitation, anti-PKCϵ, anti-GFP, or anti-IgG was cross-linked on protein G Plus-agarose beads. Four μg of each antibody was cross-linked to 50 μl of protein G Plus-agarose beads with dimethyl pimelimidate. GH3B6 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, and incubated for 45 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were prepared from cells incubated or not with PMA and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. Supernatants were collected. Aliquots of supernatants containing 500 μg of proteins were precleared with 50 μl of protein G Plus-agarose beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Precleared supernatants were then incubated with 50 μl of anti-PKCϵ-, anti-GFP-, or anti-IgG-coupled beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. Bound material was eluted with Laemmli buffer for SDS-PAGE. Real time recording was performed as described (22.Guérineau N.C. Bonnefont X. Stoeckel L. Mollard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10389-10395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At the time of observation, the culture medium was replaced by a prewarmed buffer, at 37 °C, composed of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 6 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Images were acquired continuously, with intervals between frames of 0.533 s. Fold compatibility for the full-length and truncated sequences of the human PKCϵ sequence was searched using the meta-server @TOME (23.Douguet D. Labesse G. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 752-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Domain organization was refined using fold recognition results. Automatic modeling of recognized domains was performed with SCWRL (24.Canutescu A.A. Shelenkov A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) and MODELLER (25.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10448) Google Scholar), and the validity of the resulting models was evaluated with PROSA (26.Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar) and Verify3D (27.Eisenberg D. Lüthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Fold recognition was resumed for the variable regions. Improved three-dimensional models were built using MODELLER 7.0 with the loop optimization procedure. Previous studies showed that, in the V3 region of PKCα and PKCϵ, respectively, the GDE or GEE motif is essential but not sufficient for selective cell-cell contact targeting. Accordingly, replacing GFE by GEE in the PKCδ V3 domain does not result in a selective cell-cell contact targeting of a PKCδ-GFP fusion protein (11.Quittau-Prévostel C. Delaunay N. Collazos A. Vallentin A. Joubert D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PKC targeting to the cell-cell contact, we compared the V3 sequences of PKCα, ϵ, and δ (11.Quittau-Prévostel C. Delaunay N. Collazos A. Vallentin A. Joubert D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with those of PKCβ1 and -γ (Fig. 1A) and analyzed PKCβ1 and -γ localization when fused to GFP. In TRH-stimulated GH3B6 cells, PKCβ1-GFP translocated to the entire plasma membrane, including the cell-cell contact region (Fig. 1C). Changing the GSE of PKCβ1 into the GDE of PKCα induced its selective localization at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 1C). We then analyzed the behavior of PKCγ (Fig. 1A), an isoform that, when activated, selectively localizes at cell-cell contacts but that is not naturally expressed in GH3B6 cells. Like PKCα, it possesses an Asp in position 294, but, unlike PKCα, the motif reads ADN instead of GDE. Here, we show that the targeting selectivity of PKCγ-GFP was lost when ADN was changed to AGN (Fig. 1C), suggesting that only the central Asp or Glu within the ADN, GDE, or GEE motif is essential for selectivity. Accordingly, activated PKCϵ still localized at cell-cell contacts after changing the GEE motif into AEE (G373A) or GEA (E375A), and the Glu-374 of PKCϵ can be replaced by an Asp (as in PKCα) without affecting the selective targeting to cell-cell contacts (Fig. 1C). The genuine nature of PKCϵ translocation at the actual cell-cell contact upon activation was then confirmed by costaining with p120-catenin, a marker of adherens junctions (supplemental Fig. 1A). Indeed, both proteins colocalized at the cell-cell contacts. Glu-374 and Asp-294 are necessary but not sufficient to target PKCϵ and -α to cell-cell contacts (11.Quittau-Prévostel C. Delaunay N. Collazos A. Vallentin A. Joubert D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), implying that neighboring amino acids could be important. We first compared the amino acid sequence close to the Glu-374 or to the corresponding amino acid of various PKC isoforms (Fig. 2A) and detected putative structural motives very close to the Glu-374 of PKCϵ: a putative amphipathic α-helix (aa 358–369) (see the Network Protein Sequence Analysis server) (Fig. 2B) and a binding site for the 14-3-3 protein (aa 364–370) (Fig. 2C) (see the ELM server). PKCϵ possesses another 14-3-3-binding site, in position 343–348 (Fig. 2C), in agreement with the fact that 14-3-3 generally dimerizes to achieve efficient binding. The 356–375 sequence of PKCϵ thus includes the amino acid Glu-374 essential for cell-cell contact targeting selectivity, a putative amphipathic α-helix, and one of the two 14-3-3-binding sites present in PKCϵ (28.Saurin A.T. Durgan J. Cameron A.J. Faisal A. Marber M.S. Parker P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 356–375 sequence of PKCϵ contains the essential molecular determinants for selective cell-cell contact targeting, it was introduced into the V3 region of PKCδ, fused to the C1 region of PKCϵ, or inserted into chimerin-α1, a non-PKC protein normally localized in the Golgi in the presence of PMA. These constructs were fused to GFP. Controls consisted of the 356–375 sequence containing the E374G mutation (mut 3CTS) and of the 17 aa downstream of the GEE motif (cont) (Fig. 3A). Although PKCδ-GFP translocated to the entire plasma membrane upon activation, including the cell-cell contact, the chimeric 3CTS-PKCδ-GFP selectively translocated to cell-cell contacts, suggesting that this 20-aa PKCϵ sequence probably contains the essential molecular determinants for cell-cell contact targeting (Fig. 3B). Indeed, when the inserted 20-aa sequence was mutated (E374G, +mut 3CTS) or replaced by the 17 aa found downstream of the GEE motif in wild-type PKCϵ (+cont), the resulting PKCδ chimeras translocated to the entire plasma membrane upon activation, similar to wild-type PKCδ. It is of note that wild-type PKCδ and PKCδ bearing the control 3CTS also accumulated in the perinuclear region. In addition, the C1–3CTS-GFP fusion protein was found to translocate and accumulate selectively at the cell-cell contact upon PMA activation, in contrast with the same fusion protein bearing the E374G mutation, the construct bearing the control sequence, or C1-GFP, which all accumulated indiscriminately along the entire cell membrane (Fig. 3B). Finally, in the presence of PMA, chimerin-α1 bearing the 20-aa sequence partially accumulated at cell-cell contacts, whereas the control sequence did not alter chimerin-α1 localization (Fig. 3C). Thus, the 20-aa sequence does behave as a selective targeting sequence regardless of the protein it is fused to, and we consequently propose to call it 3CTS for cell-cell contact targeting sequence. It is of note that, in agreement with data showing that the V3 region does not contain any phosphatidylserine-binding site, 3CTS is not by itself capable of accumulating at cell-cell contacts (29.Johnson J.E. Giorgione J. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11360-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 30.Newton A.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1993; 22: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). When fused to GFP alone, the resulting construct is only able to accumulate transiently and very weakly at cell-cell contacts (supplemental Fig. 2D). To assess the potential role of 3CTS in the regulation of targeting selectivity, we analyzed whether exogenous 3CTS could disrupt the PKCϵ translocation process. To deliver intracellularly the 3CTS sequence, RhoB-3CTS was chemically linked to the peptide vector sequence (R-Ahx-R)4 already used for the vectorization of oligonucleotides (31.Abes S. Moulton H.M. Clair P. Prevot P. Youngblood D.S. Wu R.P. Iversen P.L. Lebleu B. J. Control Release. 2006; 116: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated in the presence of 2.5 μm RhoB-3CTS-(R-Ahx-R)4 for 30 min. A 3CTS scramble peptide also linked to (R-Ahx-R)4 was used as a control. As shown in Fig. 4A, 3CTS entered the cells only when fused to (R-Ahx-R)4, and incubating cells with RhoB-3CTS-(R-Ahx-R)4 abolished targeting selectivity but not translocation (Fig. 4B), meaning that 3CTS is indeed essential for specifying the location of activated PKCϵ in pituitary cells. The control sequence did not affect targeting selectivity. 14-3-3 adaptor proteins are conserved polypeptides that mediate the cellular effects of many protein kinases through their ability to bind specific serine- or threonine-phosphorylated peptide motifs (32.Jin J. Smith F.D. Stark C. Wells C.D. Fawcett J.P. Kulkarni S. Metalnikov P. O'Donnell P. Taylor P. Taylor L. Zougman A. Woodgett J.R. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1436-1450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Recently, phosphorylation sites within PKCϵ, which control its association with 14-3-3, have been identified (28.Saurin A.T. Durgan J. Cameron A.J. Faisal A. Marber M.S. Parker P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 33.Durgan J. Cameron A.J. Saurin A.T. Hanrahan S. Totty N. Messing R.O. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that association of PKCϵ with 14-3-3 is essential for the completion of cytokinesis. To determine whether the 14-3-3-binding site located within 3CTS is involved in the translocation of PKCϵ, we first built an in silico model of the interaction between 3CTS and 14-3-3 and then tested it by characterizing functionally the interaction between PKCϵ or 3CTS and 14-3-3. The model was derived from the crystal structure Protein Data Bank code 1ib1 of the 14-3-3ζ-serotonin N-acetyltransferase complex (34.Obsil T. Ghirlando R. Klein D.C. Ganguly S. Dyda F. Cell. 2001; 105: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). This structure contains tetramers of 14-3-3-acetyltransferase with one-to-one interactions involving mainly the phosphopeptide and its recognition site. This suggests that PKC could, similarly, bind as soon as one of its 14-3-3-binding motifs is phosphorylated. Alternatively, the presence of two putative 14-3-3-binding sites on the same polypeptide implies that one monomeric PKC could interact with two 14-3-3 polypeptides as part of a heterotrimer. A model of both types of complexes can thus be generated. The first one, composed of two identical phosphosites, would be predicted to fit perfectly with the crystal structures revealed for various 14-3-3 complexes (Fig. 5A). The interactions with the 3CTS motif may extend to its helical region, including Ile-363. In this configuration, the model predicted that the 14-3-3 and 3CTS interface may span 10 residues of the 3CTS central region (from Ile-363 to Arg-372), whereas the N terminus of the helix and the motif GEE at the C terminus would not be expected to interact with 14-3-3. When unbound, and except for the 5 last C-terminal residues (including Glu-374), 3CTS was predicted to adopt a helical conformation. However, upon binding to 14-3-3, partial unfolding of the helix is expected to allow a perfect fit into the 14-3-3 groove. In the alternative complex, both phosphoserines 346 and 368 would be interacting with the 14-3-3-binding pocket. The predicted helical segment of the central region of 3CTS would bridge the two phosphosites. The resulting heterotrimeric model is represented in Fig. 5A. The precise orientation of the amphipathic helix cannot be clearly determined using this model, and additional interactions of PKCϵ with 14-3-3 could thus involve the hydrophobic region of the amphipathic helix, particularly via its Ile-363. The functionality and significance of this PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction are assessed below. In addition, the model predicted that the remaining helical segment, which contains the hydrophobic Ile-363 residue, should not prevent direct interaction of Ile-363 with 14-3-3 at the edge of the binding groove. This model further implied that substituting an Ala, Phe or Gly for Ile-363 should affect protein/protein interaction either directly (I363A, I363F) or indirectly (I363G) by destabilizing the helical conformation. The precise role of this helical segment is analyzed further below. Fig. 5B shows that the amount of endogenous PKCϵ coimmunoprecipitating with 14-3-3 increased drastically in the presence of PMA or TRH, suggesting that a PMA- or TRH-stimulated kinase activity is involved in modulating the direct or indirect PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction. To decipher the molecular details of this interaction selectively, we then used GFP-tagged PKCϵ, C1–3CTS, and 3CTS constructs, which were all found to coimmunoprecipitate with 14-3-3, unlike GFP itself (Fig. 5, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 3). These interactions were increased in the presence of PMA (data not shown), which was therefore used for all subsequent coimmunoprecipitation experiments, unless otherwise specified. Because serine or threonine phosphorylation of the prospective partner is a prerequisite for 14-3-3 binding, the fact that the PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction is increased in the presence of PMA could mean that serine phosphorylation is increased within the 3CTS under these conditions. Fig. 6A shows that 3CTS-GFP serine phosphorylation was strongly increased in the presence of PMA and that introducing the S368A substitution decreased serine phosphorylation to GFP background phosphorylation levels (Fig. 6B), in agreement with what was shown by Durgan et al. (33.Durgan J. Cameron A.J. Saurin A.T. Hanrahan S. Totty N. Messing R.O. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Substitution of Ser-368 by Ala also resulted in a diminished PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction (Fig. 5B). The Ser-346 of the second 14-3-3-binding site of PKCϵ was also involved in this interaction because abolition of the interaction was observed only when both sites were mutated. Mimicking constitutive phosphorylation with S368E within PKCϵ resulted in an increased amount of 14-3-3 coimmunoprecipitating with PKCϵ (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained with the S346E substitution, arguing in favor of the 14-3-3-binding sites of 3CTS being involved in the PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction. These results were confirmed with a 3CTS-GFP construct (Fig. 5C). Fig. 5D also shows that E374G mutation does not alter PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction, suggesting that selectivity of translocation, which is abolished by the E374G mutant, does not involve PKCϵ interaction with 14-3-3. However, to get further insights on the relationship between 14-3-3 and PKCϵ translocation, we analyzed the effect of introducing the Ser-368 and Ser-346 mutation in PKCϵ-GFP on the translocation of this enzyme. Disrupting the PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction increases the number of cells where PKCϵ translocation is observed. Indeed, the percentage of cells where PKCϵ S346A/S368A-GFP was targeted exclusively to cell-cell contacts increased significantly compared with wild-type PKCϵ-GFP (77% versus 55%; p = 0.04) (Fig. 7A). No change was observed when using the single mutants, in agreement with the fact that these mutants are still capable of interacting with 14-3-3, although less efficiently than the native enzyme. Thus, PKCϵ interaction with 14-3-3 appears to control PKCϵ translocation negatively, although both are induced by PMA or TRH. Furthermore, the fact that selectivity of targeting is maintained when PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction is abolished suggests that 14-3-3 is not involved in the control of cell-cell contact targeting selectivity. Taking advantage of an isoleucine located in a central position (Ile-363) on the hydrophobic face of the predicted α-helix, three different aa substitutions were performed: one to destabilize the helical segment (I363G), one to affect the hydrophobicity (I363A) (which decreases the side chain size), and one to preserve membrane anchoring while disrupting the protein-protein interface (I363F) (supplemental Fig. 4). These substitutions were first introduced in the C1–3CTS-GFP construct. All aa substitutions were found to abolish C1–3CTS translocation (Fig. 7B and supplemental Fig. 4), suggesting that the 3CTS amphipathic α-helix structure is an essential molecular determinant of the translocation process. When the I363G substitution was introduced in PKCϵ-GFP, it also induced a decrease in translocation of the PKCϵ I363G mutant, from 55 to 33% (Fig. 7A). This decrease was close to significance (p = 0.07), suggesting that the α-helix plays a role in the translocation process. We then analyzed the effect of this I363G mutation on the interaction between 14-3-3 and PKCϵ-GFP or C1–3CTS-GFP and found that both mutants did not interact with 14-3-3 (Fig. 5E). The likely explanation of this result is that the I363G mutation disrupted a process located upstream of the PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction. Indeed, if the amphipathic helix was merely facilitating the interaction between PKCϵ and 14-3-3, this disruption would have been expected to increase the translocation to cell-cell contacts, similar to what was seen with the double S368A/S346A mutant. Results of this work suggest that the 3CTS sequence within PKCϵ controls both translocation and targeting selectivity of this enzyme to cell-cell contact. It controls translocation via the α-helix because, when the helix is destabilized, translocation is inhibited. It controls selectivity because of the presence of the essential Glu-374 amino acid, and it controls the functions that PKCϵ exerts via its association with 14-3-3 because one of the binding sites involved in PKCϵ interaction with 14-3-3 is located within 3CTS. The fact that GFP cannot accumulate efficiently at the cell-cell contact when fused to 3CTS indicates that 3CTS contains the molecular determinants needed for selective targeting but not for accumulation at the cell-cell contact. This agrees well with the fact that the predicted amphipathic α-helix in 3CTS most probably does not mediate any strong interaction with phospholipids but is involved in protein/protein interaction. Indeed, the amphipathic α-helix is involved upstream of the interaction of PKCϵ with 14-3-3 because when it is destructured, PKCϵ translocation is abolished. Also, our data show that overexpression of 3CTS abolishes selectivity of targeting. Because 3CTS cannot accumulate at cell-cell contacts, this argues in favor of selectivity being determined prior to accumulation at cell-cell contacts. In the present work, we also provide substantial evidence demonstrating that PKCϵ interacts with 14-3-3, as recently suggested by Saurin et al. (28.Saurin A.T. Durgan J. Cameron A.J. Faisal A. Marber M.S. Parker P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and by Durgan et al. (33.Durgan J. Cameron A.J. Saurin A.T. Hanrahan S. Totty N. Messing R.O. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2008; 411: 319-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although in these two publications, the interaction of the endogenous proteins was not documented in contrast to our work. We also provide a model predicting the nature of this interaction via a 14-3-3-binding site located in 3CTS. Endogenous PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction was weak in basal conditions and markedly increased in the presence of PMA or TRH, suggesting that in GH3B6 cells also, phosphorylation of PKCϵ by a PMA-dependent kinase is responsible for PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction. PKCα could participate in this process because its activation is necessary for PKCϵ translocation (10.Collazos A. Diouf B. Guérineau N.C. Quittau-Prévostel C. Peter M. Coudane F. Hollande F. Joubert D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2247-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and because it was shown to be involved in PKCϵ Ser-368 phosphorylation in the process of cytokinesis (28.Saurin A.T. Durgan J. Cameron A.J. Faisal A. Marber M.S. Parker P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The involvement of 3CTS in the PKCϵ/14-3-3 interaction was further supported by the fact that C1–3CTS-GFP and 3CTS-GFP both coimmunoprecipitated with 14-3-3 and by showing that the Ser-to-Ala substitution in either of these two constructs abolished the interaction. The data presented here show that 14-3-3 functions as an inhibitor of PKCϵ translocation, in agreement with other previous examples found in the literature (35.Matto-Yelin M. Aitken A. Ravid S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1889-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36.Meller N. Liu Y.C. Collins T.L. Bonnefoy-Bérard N. Baier G. Isakov N. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results also point to a new paradigm; PMA (or TRH) may initiate two processes with seemingly opposed effects on two separate pools of PKCϵ: it initiates PKCϵ translocation, and at the same time, it initiates binding of PKCϵ to 14-3-3, which inhibits translocation. The fact that 14-3-3 inhibits PKCϵ translocation does not imply that it sequesters PKCϵ to prevent its function. Instead, we propose that the interaction of PKCϵ with 14-3-3 may initiate a function of PKCϵ different from that exerted at the cell-cell contact, thus allowing the involvement of PKCϵ in new aspects of cell biology, as shown by Saurin et al. (28.Saurin A.T. Durgan J. Cameron A.J. Faisal A. Marber M.S. Parker P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) concerning cytokinesis. In this model, upon PMA stimulation, the amplitude of each PKCϵ function could depend on the proportion interacting with 14-3-3 and that relocating to the cell membrane (Fig. 8). Interestingly, Par-1b membrane localization has been shown to be also negatively regulated when its binding to 14-3-3 is induced via phosphorylation of Ser-400 by protein kinase D activated by nPKC (37.Watkins J.L. Lewandowski K.T. Meek S.E. Storz P. Toker A. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18378-18383Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, two molecular mechanisms involving 3CTS appear to be at work for PKCϵ: one that allows translocation or not and the other that determines selectivity. The former involves the amphipathic α-helix and 14-3-3; the latter occurs via Glu-374 (Fig. 8). This does not mean that other amino acids or regions of PKCϵ are not involved in translocation/targeting, as already demonstrated (38.Csukai M. Chen C.H. De Matteis M.A. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29200-29206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 39.Takahashi M. Mukai H. Oishi K. Isagawa T. Ono Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34592-34596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this work identifies for the first time a previously unsuspected function for the V3 domain of PKCϵ in the translocation/targeting process and underlines the role of this region as a platform for protein/protein interactions.
