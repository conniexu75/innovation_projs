https://openalex.org/W2149212516,"Metabolomics is an emerging tool that can be used to gain insights into cellular and physiological responses. Here we present a metabolome differential display method based on capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry to profile liver metabolites following acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity. We globally detected 1,859 peaks in mouse liver extracts and highlighted multiple changes in metabolite levels, including an activation of the ophthalmate biosynthesis pathway. We confirmed that ophthalmate was synthesized from 2-aminobutyrate through consecutive reactions with γ-glutamylcysteine and glutathione synthetase. Changes in ophthalmate level in mouse serum and liver extracts were closely correlated and ophthalmate levels increased significantly in conjunction with glutathione consumption. Overall, our results provide a broad picture of hepatic metabolite changes following acetaminophen treatment. In addition, we specifically found that serum ophthalmate is a sensitive indicator of hepatic GSH depletion, and may be a new biomarker for oxidative stress. Our method can thus pinpoint specific metabolite changes and provide insights into the perturbation of metabolic pathways on a large scale and serve as a powerful new tool for discovering low molecular weight biomarkers."

Cytochrome P-450 3A4 cyp304 is responsible for the metabolism of over 50% of current prescription drugs, and cyp3a4 expression is transcriptionally regulated by pregnane X receptor (PXR), which is a ligand-dependent transcription factor. In this study, we report that NF-κB activation by lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor-α plays a pivotal role in the suppression of cyp3a4 through interactions of NF-κB with the PXR·retinoid X receptor (RXR) complex. Inhibition of NF-κB by NF-κB-specific suppressor SRIκBα reversed the suppressive effects of lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor-α. Furthermore, we showed that NF-κB p65 disrupted the association of the PXR·RXRα complex with DNA sequences as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. NF-κB p65 directly interacted with the DNA-binding domain of RXRα and may prevent its binding to the consensus DNA sequences, thus inhibiting the transactivation by the PXR·RXRα complex. This mechanism of suppression by NF-κB activation may be extended to other nuclear receptor-regulated systems where RXRα is a dimerization partner.

Inflammatory responses and infections suppress the biotransformation of drugs and decrease the hepatointestinal capacity of drug clearance. This results in alterations of therapeutic indices and increases the toxicity of certain administered drugs. Inflammatory responses also play important roles in liver pathological conditions such as drug-induced hepatitis and cholestatic diseases (1Lehmann V. Freudenberg M.A. Galanos C. J. Exp.

In human liver, the first pass of biotransformation is mainly carried out by cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2The abbreviations used are: CYP3A4, cytochrome P-450 3A4; hPXR, human pregnane X receptor; hPXR, human PXR; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RIF, rifampicin; SRIκBα, super repressor IκBα; LPS, lipopolysachride; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: CYP3A4, cytochrome P-450 3A4; hPXR, human pregnane X receptor; hPXR, human PXR; RXR, retinoid X receptor; RIF, rifampicin; SRIκBα, super repressor IκBα; LPS, lipopolysachride; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 3A4, which is the predominant isoform of monooxygenases that are expressed in the adult hepatointestinal system. It is estimated that CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of over 50% of drugs in use today, many of which are either metabolically activated and/or metabolically broken down (detoxified) through this enzyme. Therefore, transcriptional and post-transcriptional alterations of CYP3A4 activity have direct effects on the efficacy of drugs and detoxification of xenobiotics (reviewed in Refs. 3Guengerich F.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar and 4Quattrochi L.C. Guzelian P.S. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 615-622PubMed Google Scholar). Recent molecular and pharmacological studies have demonstrated that transcriptional activation of cyp3a4 is mediated by the nuclear receptor PXR (pregnane X receptor). The rodent PXR (5Kliewer S.A.

PXR regulates the expression of cyp3a4 by associating with its obligate partner RXR, and the heterodimer binds to the nuclear receptor response elements found in the regulatory regions of these genes. Genes that are regulated by PXR include multiple drug-resistant genes such as MDR1 (9Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) and MRP2 (10Kast H.R. Goodwin B. Tarr P.T. Jones S.A. Anisfeld A.M. Stoltz C.M. Tontonoz P. Kliewer S. Willson T.M. Edwards P.A. J.

PXR·RXR can also interact with pathways regulated by other nuclear receptors such as the constitutive androstane receptor·RXR by mutual binding to the consensus regulatory DNA sequences, thus forming a redundant, compensatory network for the metabolism and disposition of xenobiotic and endobiotics (14Xie W. Barwick J.L. Simon C.M. Pierce A.M. Safe S. Blumberg B. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3014-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of cyp3a4 suppression caused by inflammatory responses and infections have been investigated (15Morgan E.T. Drug Metab. Rev. 1997; 29: 1129-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 16Renton K.W. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Several aspects of the transcriptional regulation may be involved including decreases of PXR and RXR mRNA levels or induction of the liver inhibitory protein, which suppresses cyp3a4 through a distal flanking region (17Martinez-Jimenez C.P. Gomez-Lechon M.J. Castell J.V. Jover R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 2088-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is likely that modulation of transcriptional activation by several pathways leads to down-regulation of PXR-regulated gene expression. It has been shown that most inflammatory cytokines induced during sepsis and aseptic responses lead to suppression of CYP3A4 gene expression. We hypothesize that there may be immediate, early events at transcriptional level where the effects of the proinflammatory responses converge. One of the critical responses to acute infections and inflammations is the activation of NF-κB (18Aggarwal B.B. Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 203-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar, 19Karin M. Greten F.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar, 20Xiao C. Ghosh S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2005; 560: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which has pleiotropic functions and has been shown to down-regulate the transcriptional activity of multiple steroid/nuclear receptors (21McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB regulates innate as well as adaptive immune systems. One of the pivotal functions of NF-κB is its swift activation in response to LPS or proinflammatory cytokines, which is an evolutionally conserved defensive mechanism against infections. The classic NF-κB consists of p65 (RelA) and p50 heterodimer, and it is activated in response to various stimuli including LPS, TNF-α, double-stranded RNA, and UV radiation. In this study, we investigate the role of NF-κB in regulation of the transcriptional activity of the PXR·RXRα complex in an attempt to address the mechanism of suppression of cyp3a4 by LPS and proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α. The results reveal that NF-κB plays an important role in suppression of PXR·RXRα-regulated gene expression by interfering with the binding of PXR·RXRα to the regulatory DNA sequences. The mechanism may have general implications in gene expressions regulated by nuclear receptors where RXRα is a common dimerization partner. Oligonucleotides as the PCR primers and ER6 EMSA probe, the DNA modifying enzymes, and Lipofectamine were from Invitrogen. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Invitrogen or HyClone (Logan, UT), fetal bovine serum was from Atlanta Biologicals (Lawrenceville, GA). Plasmid DNA purification kits, rifampicin, lipopolysachride, and monoclonal antibody against the FLAG tag were from Sigma. Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, IN). The polyclonal antibodies against RXRα and p65 were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). The human HepG2 cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Plasmid Constructs—The reporter plasmid pGL3–3A4-Luc was constructed via the following steps. First, the promoter module (–362/+53)-containing DNA fragment was generated by PCR amplification using human genomic DNA as the template with the primers (5′-CATTGCTGGCTGAGGTGGTT-3′ and 5′-CATAAGCTTTGTTGCTCTTTGCTGGGCTATGTGC-3′). The 1.13-kb PCR product was restricted with BglII and Hind III, and the resultant 415-bp fragment was cloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega) to yield pGL3-3A4 (–362/+53). The DNA fragment corresponding to the XREM region (–7836 to –7208) (23Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) were generated by PCR with the primer oligonucleotides CYP3A4-3 (5′-GGGGTACCATTCTAGAGAGATGGTTCATTCC-3′) and CYP3A4-4 (5′-CCGCTCGAGATCTTCGTCAACAGGTTAAAGGAG-3′), 5′ KpnI site and 3′ BglII site were created by restriction digestion. The KpnI and BglII fragment was then inserted into the KpnI- and BglII-restricted pGL3-3A4 plasmid to yield the pGL3-3A4-Luc reporter gene. The expression vector for hPXR, pCI-hPXR, and FLAG-PXR was generated as follows, DNA fragment corresponding to the coding region of hPXR (amino acids 1–434) was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA from HepG2 cells. For pCI-PXR, the PCR primers were 5′-GGGAATTCCCACCAGGAGGTGAGACCCAAAGAAAGCTGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGTCGACGCGGCCGCTCAGCTACCTGTGATGCCGAACA-3′; for FLAG-PXR, the PCR primers were 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCTGGAGGTGAGACCCAAAGA-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGCTACCTGTGATGCCG-3′, designed based on published hPXR sequence (6Lehmann J.M. McKee D.D. Watson M.A. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 102: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). The PCR product was modified with EcoRI and NotI or with NotI and BamHI and cloned into the pCI-neo vector (Promega) or p3XFLAG-myc-CMV-26 vector (Sigma). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—For primary human hepatocyte culture, cell suspension was purchased from Cambrex BioScience (Walkersville, MD). The donor of the human hepatocytes was a 26-year-old male without heart disease or hypertension. Serological tests showed negative for human immunodeficiency virus, types 1 and 2, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus, human T-cell lymphotropic I/II virus, and syphilis. Upon arrival the cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, 4 μg/ml insulin, and 1 μmol/liter dexamethasone, plated in collagen-coated plate for attachment, and then maintained in Williams' E medium containing ITS+ (insulin, transferrin, selenium, borine serum albumin, and linoleic acid), 0.1 μmol/liter dexamethasone and antibiotics overnight for recovery, and then the cells were treated with Me2SO, RIF, RIF+LPS, and RIF+TNF-α. 24 h after the treatment, the cells were harvested for isolation of total RNA for real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis. HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For transient transfection, HepG2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 30% confluence. On the next day transfection was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 6 h after transfection, cells were treated with RIF and other reagents. 48 h later, cells were harvested to determine the luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega). Conclusions were made based on three or more independent transfection experiments. In Vitro Transcription Coupled to Translation and EMSA—Human PXR and human RXRα polypeptides were generated by in vitro transcription coupled to translation using TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides used for EMSA were the ER6 consensus sequences in cyp3a4 promoter region as described (14Xie W. Barwick J.L. Simon C.M. Pierce A.M. Safe S. Blumberg B. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3014-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Klenow enzyme (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH). For EMSA assay, PXR and RXRα and recombinant p50 (Promega) and p65 (produced by baculoviral expressions) in various combinations were incubated for 30 min in a reaction mixture containing 40 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 4% Ficoll (400 K), and ∼30000 cpm of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction mixtures were separated by electrophoresis in 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The results were recorded by autoradiography. Real Time Quantitative PCR—For real time quantitative PCR, total RNA samples were reverse-transcribed by using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and the cDNA samples were used for quantification by PCR. Amplifications were performed in the ABI Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems) by using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The PCR primers used were: PXR, 5′-GGCCACTGGCTATCACTTCAA-3′ and 5′-TTCATGGCCCTCCTGAAAA-3′; RXRα, 5′-TCAATGGCGTCCTCAAGGTC-3′ and 5′-TTGCCTGAGGAGCGGTCC-3′; CYP3A4, 5′-CCACAAAGCTCTGTCCGATCT-3′ and 5′-GAACACTGCTCGTGGTTTCACA-3′; and β-actin, 5′-CCATCGAGCACGGCATC-3′ and 5′-ATTGTAGAAGGTGTGGTGCCAGA-3′. The β-actin was used as a housekeeping gene for normalization with the rest of the samples. Immunocytochemistry—Primary human hepatocytes growing in 24-well plates were treated with LPS or TNF-α for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with cold PBS and then fixed with fresh 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were permeablized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS (three times for 5 min each), the cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS/Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Then primary antibody against p65 (Santa Cruz, sc-109X) diluted (1:500) in PBS/Tween 20 was added, and the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After three washes with PBS/Tween 20, 10 min each, secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluo-568 (Molecular Probe, A11011) diluted in PBS/Tween 20 (1:1000) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS/Tween 20 three times for 10 min each. 4′,6′-Diamino-2-phenylindole was added to stain the cells. The images were visualized, and representative views of the cells were recorded by fluorescence microscopy with an Olympus IX71 microscope. GST Pull-down Analysis—The GST pull-down assay was essentially as described (22Tian Y. Ke S. Chen M. Sheng T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44041-44048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine-labeled full-length p65 protein was generated with a TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) using the T7 promoter-driven cDNA plasmid as the template. PCR-generated cDNA fragments of RXRα corresponding to the domains of RXRα (see Fig. 5A for details and the sequences of PCR primer used are available upon request) were inserted into pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham Biosciences), yielding the expression plasmids for GST-RXRα fusion peptides. The plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21), and fusion polypeptides were purified with the glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity matrix (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of each fusion polypeptides (estimated by comparison with bovine serum albumin in an SDS-PAGE gel with Coomassie staining) was incubated with 20 μl of radiolabeled p65 in a total of 250 μl of binding reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 100 mm KCl) for 2 h at 4°C. After incubation, the beads were washed with the same buffer without bovine serum albumin five times. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer and resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The signals were detected by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was based on published procedure with modification (11Goodwin B. Moore J.T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2004; 25: 437-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged PXR and pGL3-3A4-Luc and were maintained in 10-cm plates under standard cell culture conditions. At 95% confluence formaldehyde was added directly to tissue culture medium to a final concentration of 1% for cross-linking, and the plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature on a rocker. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The plates were then rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped off the plates and collected into 50-ml conical tubes by centrifugation (600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the pellet was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and resuspended in 2 ml of cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin) and incubated for on ice for 10 min. The cells were homogenized on ice using an B type pestle by processing in a Dounce homogenizer 200 times to aid the release of nuclei. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation (5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and then resuspended them in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin) and incubated again on ice for 10 min. The samples were sonicated into DNA fragments of 0.5–1.5 kilobase pairs (checked by agarose gel electrophoresis/ethidium bromide staining) and microcentrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was cleared by incubation with Staph A cells (2.5 μg/sample; Roche Applied Science) for 15 min and AG beads for 30–60 min sequentially at 4 °C on a rotating platform. The supernatant was aliquoted after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min to the clean tubes. Appropriate antibodies (1 μg each) were added to the aliquots and then 25 μl of precleared 50% protein A/G beads (Amersham Biosciences) was added. The final volume of each sample was adjusted to no more than 500 μl with the same amount of immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA) as the nuclei lysis buffer. The mixtures were incubated on the rotating platform at 4 °C, overnight. After incubation, the beads were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 1 min in a microcentrifuge, and pellets were washed once with 1 ml of 1× dialysis buffer (2 mm EDTA; 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) with 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, twice with 1× dialysis buffer and three times with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation wash buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid) for 10 min with rotation. After the wash, 200 μl of protein kinase digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, 100 mg/ml proteinase K) was added to each sample, and the reaction was incubated at 55 °C for 3 h and then at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the cross-linking. The sample was extracted once with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen overnight. The precipitated pellets were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g in microcentrifuge, and the pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of TE buffer. Aliquots from each tube were amplified by PCR, and PCR products were separated by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The PCR primer pairs were 5′-TTGGACTCCCCAGTAACATTG-3′ and 5′-TGCATGGAGCTTTCCTGC-3′ for amplifying the cyp3a4 promoter region and 5′-ACTCATGTCCCAATTAAAGGTC-3′ and 5′-TGTTCTTGTCAGAAGTTCAGC-3′ for amplifying the enhancer module. Suppression of PXR-mediated Gene Activation by LPS and TNF-α in Human Liver Cells—The effects of LPS and TNF-α on the expression of PXR, RXRα, and CYP3A4 were investigated in a primary human hepatocyte cell culture model by quantitative real time PCR. Treatment of the hepatocytes with the prototypical human PXR agonist RIF induced a 34-fold increase in CYP3A4 mRNA; the RIF-induced CYP3A4 mRNA levels were suppressed by more than 50 and 90% after cotreatment with either TNF-α (2 ng/ml, 24 h) and LPS (5 μg/ml, 24 h), respectively (Fig. 1A). In contrast, PXR mRNA levels were unchanged by TNF-α treatment, and there was an approximately 30% decrease in hPXR mRNA in LPS-treated samples (Fig. 1B). RXRα mRNA levels were not significantly changed after treatments with either LPS or TNF-α (Fig. 1C). Activation of NF-κB by LPS or TNF-α was confirmed by immunocytochemistry for p65 nuclear translocation (Fig. 1D). The RNA samples were also analyzed by microarray profiling, and the results were consistent with those obtained by the quantitative PCR, with respect to the changes of PXR, RXRα levels, and the suppression of cyp3a4 by LPS or TNF-α (data not shown). To further investigate the effects of proinflammatory agents on the transcriptional activity of PXR and to avoid donor variability in PXR-regulated genes in the human primary hepatocytes, we constructed the luciferase reporter gene driven by PXR-responsive enhancer modules for analysis of the PXR-regulated gene expression in a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) based on the published information (Fig. 2A) (23Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were transiently cotransfected with pGL3-3A4-Luc and hPXR expression plasmids pCI-hPXR. The transfected cells were then treated with RIF alone or cotreated with RIF and LPS or RIF and TNF-α. TNF-α and LPS caused significant suppressions of the luciferase gene expression (Fig. 2B) that are consistent with the results from the primary human hepatocyte culture model (Fig. 1). These results using the HepG2 cell line also confirmed the utility of the HepG2 cell culture model in analysis of PXR-regulated transcription. NF-κB Plays a Critical Role in Down-regulation of cyp3a4 Expression by Inflammatory Mediators—NF-κB is an immediate early gene, which is activated in response to various stress stimuli including infections and inflammatory responses. NF-κB plays a pivotal role in mediating the pathological effects of TNF-α and LPS. It has been demonstrated that NF-κB regulates several nuclear/steroid receptors through physical and function interactions, resulting in transrepression of the gene expressions regulated by these receptors (24Tian Y. Ke S. Denison M.S. Rabson A.B. Gallo M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 510-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 21McKay L.I. Cidlowski J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 435-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the role of NF-κB in mediating the suppression of PXR transcriptional activity, we first transiently cotransfected NF-κB p65 with PXR-driven luciferase reporter gene in HepG2 cells. Coexpression of NF-κB p65 potently suppressed PXR-driven luciferase reporter gene activity, suggesting a role for NF-κB in mediating suppression (Fig. 3). To further demonstrate that NF-κB is specifically involved in the suppression of cyp3a4 expression, we coexpressed the NF-κB super repressor, SRIκBα, in transient transfection assays and analyzed the effects of NF-κB inhibition on TNF-α- and LPS-treated cells. SRIκBα is a mutant of IκBα with a serine to alanine mutation at residues 32 and 36. These mutations render the IκBα unable to be phosphorylated at serines 32 and 36 and therefore resistant to degradation by the proteosome pathway, thus causing constitutive inhibition of NF-κB. In transient transfection assays, HepG2 cells were cotransfected with plasmids pCI-PXR, pGL3-3A4-Luc reporter gene and increasing amounts of SRIκBα expression plasmid. As expected, activation of NF-κB by either TNF-α or LPS caused suppression of the reporter gene activity. However, the LPS or TNFα-induced suppression of reporter gene was reversed by coexpression of SRIκBα (Fig. 3), indicating that NF-κB activation was directly responsible for the suppression of the PXR-regulated gene expression. NF-κB Regulates PXR Transcriptional Activity by Disrupting the Association between PXR·RXRα Complex and DNA Sequences—It has been shown that NF-κB regulates the transcriptional activity of steroid/nuclear receptors through direct protein-protein interaction. Na et al. (25Na S.Y. Kang B.Y. Chung S.W. Han S.J. Ma X. Trinchieri G. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. Kim T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7674-7680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) reported that NF-κB directly interacts with RXR. The association of NF-κB with nuclear receptors may potentially have a functional impact on the transcriptional activity of the PXR·RXR complex. One possible effect is that the binding of p65 with RXRα may interfere with the formation of the enhancersome consisting of the PXR·RXR complex and consensus DNA sequences. To test this hypothesis, we performed EMSA. PXR and RXRα proteins were generated through in vitro transcription coupled to translation. PXR and RXRα bound to the ER6 probe as dimer (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). Addition of the recombinant p65 protein disrupted the binding of PXR·RXRα to the consensus ER6 sequence (Fig. 4, compare lane 5 with lanes 10 and 11). Interestingly, disruption by p65 could be reversed upon the addition of p50 protein, which is a cognate p65 partner known to negatively regulate p65 activity (Fig. 4, compare lane 10 with lane 12). As expected, the addition of bovine serum albumin had no effects (compare lane 5 with 7) on retarded band formation, suggesting that the p65 disrupted the binding of the PXR·RXRα complex to DNA in this assay. The results of EMSA are consistent with the hypothesis that association between RXRα and p65 prevents RXRα binding to the DNA sequences. To further analyze the interaction between RXRα and p65, we mapped the domains of RXRα responsible for association with p65 using GST pull-down assay. The known functional modular domains were fused with GST in various combinations and expressed as fusion peptides in E. coli (Fig. 5, A and C). The p65 was radiolabeled by in vitro transcription-coupled translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. Interestingly, the DNA-bindin"
https://openalex.org/W2091077559,"SUMOylation is a reversible process regulated by a family of sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs). Of the six SENP family members, except for SENP1 and SENP2, the substrate specificities of the rest of SENPs are not well defined. Here, we have described SENP5, which has restricted substrate specificity. SENP5 showed SUMO-3 C-terminal hydrolase activity but could not process pro-SUMO-1 in vitro. Furthermore, SENP5 showed more limited isopeptidase activity in vitro. In vivo, SENP5 showed isopeptidase activity against SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 conjugates but not against SUMO-1 conjugates. Native SENP5 localized mainly to the nucleolus but was also found in the nucleus. The N terminus of SENP5 contains a stretch of amino acids responsible for the nucleolar localization of SENP5. N-terminal-truncated SENP5 co-localized with PML, a known SUMO substrate. Using PML SUMOylation mutants as model substrates, we showed that SENP5 can remove poly-SUMO-2 or poly-SUMO-3 from the Lys160 or Lys490 positions of PML. However, SENP5 could not remove SUMO-1 from the Lys160 or Lys490 positions of PML. Nonetheless, SENP5 could remove SUMO-1, -2, and -3 from the Lys65 position of PML. Thus, SENP5 also possesses limited SUMO-1 isopeptidase activity. We were also able to show that SENP3 has substrate specificity similar to that of SENP5. Thus, SENP3 and SENP5 constitute a subfamily of SENPs that regulate the formation of SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 conjugates and, to a less extent, SUMO-1 modification.

A broad array of cellular processes, such as cell division, differentiation, signal transduction, trafficking, and quality control, depend on the covalent modification of proteins by ubiquitin (Ub), 2The abbreviations used are: Ub, ubiquitin; SUMO, small ubiquitin-related modifier; SENP, sentrin/SUMO-specific protease; HA, hemagglutinin; EST, expression sequence tag; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; RACE, rapid amplification of 5′-cDNA ends. a highly conserved 76-amino acid polypeptide (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). A variety of target proteins are modified by Ub through the action of a multienzyme system consisting of E1 (Ub-activating), E2 (Ub-conjugating), and E3 (Ub-ligating) enzymes. The discovery of Ub-like modifiers has further expanded our understanding of this particular form of post-translational protein modification (2Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T.

In humans at least, 12 Ub-like molecules have been identified and defined by their sequence and structural homology to Ub. Of these, the best characterized is the SUMO family, which contains SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3, and the recently identified SUMO-4 (4Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol.

McKay E.M. Yeh E.T. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that SUMO-4 has a biological role that is accomplished through non-covalent interactions. SUMO-1 shows ∼50% sequence identity to SUMO-2 and SUMO-3, which are almost identical. In contrast to SUMO-1, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 harbor a consensus SUMOylation site at their N-terminal region and likely form polymers, as demonstrated for SUMO-2 (10Tatham M.H. Jaffray E. Vaughan O.A.

Studies on protein SUMOylation have mainly focused on SUMO-1, a protein of 101 amino acids that shares 18% sequence identity with Ub. More than 100 SUMOylated proteins have been identified to date, including transcription factors, signaling molecules, nuclear envelope proteins, and even cell membrane proteins (2Yeh E.T. Gong L.

SUMOylation is catalyzed by the E1-activating enzyme complex (Aos1/Uba2), the E2-conjugating enzyme (UBC9), and E3 ligases (Ran-BP2, Pc2, or PIAS family members) (15Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K.

The covalent modification of proteins by SUMO is reversibly regulated by a family of sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) (2Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The SENPs in yeast and mammals have well conserved residues of the catalytic triad (His, Asp, and Cys) and an invariant Gln residue predicted to help form the oxyanion hole in the active site (20Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 21Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Two SENPs in yeast, Ulp1 and Ulp2/Smt4, have been reported (20Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 22Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Ulp1 is an essential protein that co-localizes with nuclear pore proteins, whereas Ulp2 localizes predominantly to the nucleus. At least seven human proteases (SENP1–8) have a conserved catalytic domain homologous to that of yeast Ulp1 (2Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). However, SENP8 (also called DEN1 or NEDP1) has less similarity with other SENPs and has been shown to be a NEDD8-specific protease (23Wu K. Yamoah K. Dolios G. Gan-Erdene T. Tan P. Chen A. Lee C.G.

Much of our knowledge of the behavior of SENPs has come from studies of SENP1 and SENP2. These have shown that SENP1 localizes to the nucleus, excluding the nucleolus (21Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and that SENP2, also called SUSP1, localizes to the nucleoplasmic face of the nuclear pore complex (25Zhang H. Saitoh H. Matunis M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6498-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 26Hang J. Dasso M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19961-19966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Both SENP1 and SENP2 are able to remove SUMO from all SUMO-modified proteins. SENP1 can also regulate a large family of transcription factors and their co-regulators (13Cheng J. Wang D. Wang Z. Yeh E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6021-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Although both SENP1 and SENP2 can regulate c-JUN-dependent transcription, SENP1 mediates its effect through the desumoylation of p300, whereas SENP2 exerts its effect via PML (27Cheng J. Perkins N.D. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14492-14498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 28Best J.L. Ganiatsas S. Agarwal S. Changou A. Salomoni P. Shirihai O. Meluh P.B.

Two additional SENPs, SENP3 (SMT3IP1) and SENP6 (SUSP1), have also been reported (29Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Jeon Y.J. Nishimori S. Suzuki T. Uchida S. Shimbara N. Saitoh H. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14102-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, their mechanisms of actions are largely unknown. Here we have reported our findings regarding SENP5, a novel SUMO-specific protease that has specificity for SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 but less so for SUMO-1. Because SENP3 is closely related to SENP5, we also investigated its substrate specificity. Interestingly, we found SENP3 is also active against SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 conjugates but, like SENP5, less so against SUMO-1 conjugates. Thus, SENP3 and SENP5 constitute a new subfamily of SENPs that share considerable sequence homology and exhibit similar substrate specificities. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—COS-7 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Transfections were performed in geneticin-free medium. Antibodies—Mouse anti-RGS (specific for the amino acid sequence RGSHHHH) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Qiagen (Santa Clara, CA). 16B12 (Babco, Richmond, CA) is a mouse monoclonal antibody to the peptide sequence YPYDVPDYA of influenza hemagglutinin (HA). The coding region of SENP5 was subcloned into pGEX-5X1, a prokaryotic expression vector for the expression of recombinant enzyme in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was used as an immunogen for generating polyclonal anti-SENP5 anti-serum. After purification, this anti-serum was used for Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. cDNA Cloning of the Human SENP5—To clone human SENP5, we initially performed a tBLASTn search of the data bases for a human-expressed sequence tag (EST) using the coding sequence of SENP1. 102 positive EST sequences were identified in the initial screen. After further analysis, one EST clone (AA134543) was found to have a 595-bp sequence similar to the “core domain” of SENP1. The nucleotide sequence of this EST clone was used to perform another BLAST search of the EST data base. One of the positive EST clones (AI651270) was shown to partially overlap with AA134543 and contain most of the 3′-non-coding region. Another positive EST clone (AA342658) extended the cDNA sequence toward the 5′-end for an additional 500 bp. The combined nucleotide sequence from these three EST clones was extended to a 1.5-kb cDNA fragment, which was confirmed by PCR amplification. The cDNA was extended toward the 5′-end by performing rapid amplification of the 5′-cDNA ends (RACE) using the oligonucleotides generated from a cDNA library vector and AA342658. A 2801-bp cDNA fragment was cloned by PCR using primers from the RACE fragment and AI651270. The full length of SENP5 (2.2 kb) was subcloned to a pcDNA3 vector for further study. Direct sequencing of the PCR fragments and comparison with genomic DNA confirmed the sequence of SENP5 cDNA. PCR, 5′-RACE, and Sequence Analysis—Nested primers were synthesized on the basis of the information obtained from the positive EST clones. These primers were used to amplify the novel protease gene fragments by PCR from a human placenta cDNA library. Both PCR and RACE were performed as described previously (16Gong L. Li B. Millas S. Yeh E.T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences were determined using dye terminator sequencing and an automated sequencer from Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA). Plasmid Construction and Transfection—The cDNAs for Ub, NEDD8, SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3 were subcloned into a pcDNA3-HA vector as described previously (31Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Kito K. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3117-3120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA fragments for SENP3 and SENP5 were cloned into a pcDNA3-RGS vector using standard techniques. The plasmids described above were transfected into COS-7 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described previously (4Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). GST Fusion Protein Expression and Purification in E. coli—The full-length cDNA of SENP1 or SENP5 was amplified by PCR from a human placenta cDNA library. The PCR product was then subcloned into pGEX-5X1 (Amersham Biosciences Inc.) using EcoRI and SalI restriction sites to generate pGEX-SENP1 or pGEX-SENP5. E. coli BL21 cells carrying pGEX-SENP1 or pGEX-SENP5 or pGEX-5X1 were then grown to saturation in 10 ml of Luria Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin and then transferred to 500 ml of Luria Bertani broth for expansion to an absorbance (at 600 nm) of 0.8. After the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside (final concentration 0.1 mm), the culture was incubated at room temperature for 3 h. The cells were then sonicated in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 100 μg/ml of egg white lysozyme), and bacterial debris was removed by centrifugation. The sonicated lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 500 μl of 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. After centrifugation, glutathione S-transferase fusion protein-bound beads were washed three times, and the protein was eluted from the beads. In Vitro Translation and SENP Protease Activity—For in vitro expression of RGS-RanGAP1, SUMO-1-HA, and SUMO-3-HA proteins, the pcDNA3-RGS-RanGAP1, pcDNA3-SUMO-1-HA, and pcDNA3-SUMO-3-HA plasmids were used as templates. Proteins were translated by using an in vitro transcription and translation kit (TNT T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysates; Promega) according to the instruction of the supplier. All translated proteins were confirmed by using Western blot analysis. For the isopeptidase activity, 5 μl of in vitro translated and SUMO-conjugated RanGAP1 was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min with ∼0.05 μg of GST-SENP1 or 5 μg of GST-SENP5 in a reaction mixture containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For the C-terminal hydrolase activity, 5 μlof in vitro translated SUMO-1-HA or SUMO-3-HA was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min with ∼0.05 μg of GST-SENP1 or 5 μg of GST-SENP5 in a reaction mixture containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The samples were loaded onto a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by Western analysis with anti-RGS or anti-HA antibodies. TALON Bead Precipitation of RH-tagged Proteins—To investigate the effect of SENP3 or SENP5 on SUMO-2 conjugation of PML-K160, we purified RH-tagged PML-K160 by TALON bead precipitation and analyzed their SUMOylation by Western blotting. Because the sequence of the RH tag is RGSHHHHHH, RH-tagged PML-K160 can be purified by cobalt-immobilized resin beads (TALON beads; Clontech). The total cell lysate of the transfectants expressing RH-tagged PML-K160 and HA-SUMO-2 with different SENPs and SENPm was prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 m guanidine-HCl, and 100 mm NaCl). DNA in the sample was sheared with a 22-gauge needle, and then the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 15 °C. The supernatant was incubated with TALON beads for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed once with lysis buffer, followed by two washings with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 15 mm imidazole, 8 m urea, and 100 mm NaCl). The beads were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated for 1 h at 50 °C in sample treating solution containing 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Finally, the solubilized RH-PML-K160 was analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blotting Analysis—HA-tagged SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3, NEDD8, or Ub were co-expressed with RGS-tagged SENP5, RGS-tagged SENP3, or control vector in COS-7 cells. Protein samples were treated at 42°C for 1 h in 300 μl of 2% SDS treating solution containing 5% mercaptoethanol. Western blotting was performed using the protocol provided with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences Inc.). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against mouse IgG or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) were used as secondary antibodies. Immunohistochemical Localization of Proteins—First, we transfected plasmids encoding RGS-tagged SENP5 into HeLa cells. HeLa cells were grown at 37 °C on round coverslips in 6-well plates (Corning Glass, Inc., Corning, NY) until they reached ∼80% confluency. Sixteen hours after the cells had been plated on the round glass coverslips, the cells were fixed at room temperature for 15 min with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, after which 10% goat serum (Invitrogen) was used to block the background activity. For the immunohistochemical staining of pcDNA3-RGS-SENP5-transfected cells, monoclonal mouse anti-RGS or polyclonal rabbit anti-SENP5 was used to visualize the RGS-SENP5. Cellular nuclei (chromatin) were stained with 1:1000 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma-Aldrich). Characterization of SENP5 Gene and cDNA—Using the full-length SENP1 protein sequence as a query in a tBLASTn sequence search, we detected three positive EST clones (T70794, N42548, and AW167097) that were homologous to the C-terminal of SENP1 (21Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Extension of the cloned cDNA by RACE resulted in the identification of a 2802-bp cDNA clone from a human placenta cDNA library that contained an open reading frame of 2265 bp encoding a protein of 755 amino acids. The protein encoded by this open reading frame was named SENP5 (2Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Data base searches also identified SENP5 orthologs in monkey, dog, rat, and mouse, but no detectable homologs were present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Fugu rubripe, or Danio rerio. Although all SENPs share a conserved catalytic domain in the C-terminal region, the domain of SENP1 was more homologous to that of SENP2 (59%) than to that of either SENP3 (42%) or SENP5 (44%) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the catalytic domain of SENP5 was 62% identical to that of SENP3 but only 44 and 42% identical to that of SENP1 and SENP2, respectively. Thus, SENP5 is more closely related to SENP3 than to either SENP1 or SENP2. Furthermore, SENP5 and SENP3 shared a 40% identity at another region directly preceding the catalytic domain, 507–573 amino acids of SENP5 and 321–392 amino acids of SENP3 (Fig. 1A). A similar conserved region is shared by SENP1 and SENP2, in that the 173–201-amino acid region of SENP1 was 55% identical to the 196–223-amino acid region of SENP2 (Fig. 1A). Thus, our analysis of sequence homology showed SENP1 and SENP2 to be more closely related and SENP3 and SENP5 to be more closely related. We found the SENP5 gene is located on human chromosome 3 and spans ∼39 kb of contiguous DNA. Further, we found that the SENP5 gene is composed of nine distinct exons ranging between 48 and 1544 bp. Both the 5′- and 3′-acceptor splice sites in each of the introns followed the GT-AG consensus sequence for eukaryotic genes. Exon 1 encodes the 5′-untranslated region, exon-2 encodes the remaining 5′-untranslated region and first 196 amino acids, exons 3 through 8 encode most of the amino acids, and exon 9 (∼399 bp) contains the final 37 codons and an extensive 3′-untranslated region of ∼288 bp. Cellular Localization and Expression of Endogenous SENP5—To characterize SENP5 in more detail, we generated a polyclonal anti-serum against SENP5 using the GST-SENP5 protein as an immunogen. Anti-SENP5 serum was also used to detect the expression of native SENP5 in three different cell lines, PC3, HeLa, and MCF7 cells, derived from prostate, blood, and breast tissue, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1B, an ∼87-kDa band, consistent with the predicted molecular mass of SENP5, was identified in all cell lysates of the three different cell lines when blotted with anti-SENP5 serum, whereas the preimmune serum did not reveal this band. This anti-serum was also used to identify the location of endogenous SENP5 in HeLa cells. First, we transfected plasmids encoding RGS-tagged SENP5 into HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1C-a, anti-SENP5 antiserum detected both the endogenous SENP5 and the exogenously expressed RGS-tagged SENP5. Further, both anti-SENP5 antiserum (Fig. 1C-a) and anti-RGS antibody (Fig. 1C-b) staining indicated that SENP5 localizes to both the nucleolus and the nucleus. 4,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining for the nucleus is shown in Fig. 1C-c. In a separate staining experiment in which HeLa cells were stained with anti-SENP5 anti-serum to detect the endogenous SENP5 and with anti-B23 antibody to detect the nucleolar protein nucleoplasmin/NPM/B23, we found the expression pattern of native SENP5 (Fig. 1C-d) and nucleoplasmin (Fig. 1C-e) to be almost identical. Thus, endogenous SENP5, similar to SENP3, also localizes to the nucleolus (29Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). C-terminal Hydrolase Activity of SENP5—Prior to activation, SUMO is proteolytically processed from its precursor to produce a conserved C-terminal Gly-Gly motif. SENP1, SENP2, and SENP6 have been demonstrated to have C-terminal hydrolase activity for SUMO-1. To determine whether SENP5 also has this ability, we expressed and purified GST-SENP1 and GST-SENP5 fusion proteins in bacteria. The HA tag was fused to the C-terminal end of SUMO-1 to generate a SUMO-1-HA fusion protein that could be used as a substrate to demonstrate SUMO-specific C-terminal hydrolase activity. The HA-tagged SUMO-1 could be detected by anti-HA antibody. As expected, however, SUMO-1-HA was absent in the sample treated with GST-SENP1, suggesting that the HA tag was removed from the SUMO-1-HA fusion protein by GST-SENP1 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, GST-SENP5 could not remove the HA tag from the SUMO-1-HA fusion protein, suggesting that GST-SENP5 does not have C-terminal hydrolase activity against SUMO-1. In terms of the protein sequence, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 belong to the same subgroup of the SUMO family because they are almost identical. SUMO-1, however, is only ∼50% identical to SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. To determine whether GST-SENP5 functions as a C-terminal hydrolase against SUMO-2/-3 subfamily, we generated SUMO-3-HA fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 2A, both GST-SENP-1 and GST-SENP5 could remove the HA tag from the SUMO-3-HA fusion protein, indicating that GST-SENP5 has C-terminal hydrolase activity against SUMO-3 but not against SUMO-1. Preference of SENP5 for SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 Conjugates in Vivo— When we tested for SENP5 isopeptidase activity against SUMO conjugates in vitro and in vivo, we found one clear SUMO-conjugated band when RanGAP1 was translated in vitro (Fig. 2B). Further, when GST-SENP1 or GST-SENP5 was used to digest SUMO-RanGAP1 in vitro, both GST-SENP1 and GST-SENP5 proved to have SUMO-specific isopeptidase activity (Fig. 2B). However, the protease activity of GST-SENP1 is 100-fold higher than GST-SENP5 (data not shown). Alternatively, SENP5 may not be able to remove all SUMO family members from SUMO-RanGAP1 because in vitro translated RanGAP1 could be modified by SUMO-1, -2, or -3 (also see description below). To demonstrate the protease activity of SENP5 in vivo, HA-tagged SUMO-1, SUMO-2, SUMO-3, NEDD8, or ubiquitin was co-expressed with RGS-tagged SENP5 or control vector in COS-7 cells. Protein modification in whole-cell lysates was detected using an antibody against the HA tag. A greater portion of higher molecular weight SUMO conjugates was removed when HA-tagged SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 was co-expressed with RGS-tagged SENP5 than when HA-tagged SUMO-3, NEDD8, or Ub was co-expressed with RGS-tagged SENP5 (Fig. 3). However, the cleavage of the SUMO-2 conjugates appeared to be less complete than that of the SUMO-3 conjugates. The SENP5(C713A) catalytic inactive mutant, which was transfected in place of SENP5 and served as a control, exhibited no activity against either SUMO-2 or SUMO-3. Nonetheless, the expression levels of both SENP5 and SENP5(C713A) were identical in all lanes, thus ruling out the possibility that the differences were due to differences in the expression of the wild-type and mutant protease (Fig. 3). In addition, SENP5 demonstrated a preference for SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 because it could not process Ub, NEDD8, or SUMO-1 conjugates in vivo. Respective Effects of SENP5 and Truncated Forms of SENP5—As described above, SENP5 is a nucleolar, SUMO-specific protease with preference for SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. To define the specific regions of SENP5 responsible for the intracellular localization and protease activity of the enzyme, we created a series of deletion mutants of SENP5, as shown in Fig. 4A. Most of the full-length SENP5 was present in the nucleolus (Fig. 4C). However, when the first 168 amino acids of SENP5 were removed, the resultant truncated SENP5, SP5d168, was localized to both the nucleus and cytosol, suggesting that the N-terminal region of SENP5 is responsible for its nucleolar localization. Interestingly, the truncated SENP5, SP5d310, co-localized with PML (Fig. 4D). To define the minimal sequence required for SENP5 to exert its catalytic activity, a series of deletion mutants were tested using SUMO-2-modified PML-K65(K160R,K490R) as a substrate. This showed that the deletion of amino acids 1–571 did not eliminate the protease activity, whereas the deletion of an additional 29 amino acids (SP5d590) did (Fig. 4B). Thus, the catalytic activity of SENP5 is independent of its N-terminal sequences and is conferred by the catalytic domain alone. Fine Mapping of Substrate Specificity of SENP5 Using PML Mutants—Because the nuclear form of SENP5 co-localizes with PML, we chose PML as a substrate to further define substrate specificity of SENP5. We have previously shown that wild-type PML could be modified by SUMO-1, -2, and -3 and that Lys65 in the RING finger domain, Lys160 in the B1 Box, and Lys490 in the nuclear localization signal constitute three major SUMOylation sites (32Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Wada H. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26675-26682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To further test the specific protease activity of SENP5, we first used a COS-7 cell expression system and wild-type PML as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 5, when the wild-type PML was co-expressed with different SUMOs in COS-7 cells, multiple SUMOylated bands could be observed (Fig. 5). As expected, the conjugated bands were completely removed when SENP1 was expressed (Fig. 5). In contrast, the expression of SENP5 only partially affected the pattern of PML SUMOylation (Fig. 5), suggesting that the protease activity of SENP5 is more restricted than that of SENP1. To further define the specificity of SENP5, we used three different PML mutants (PML-K160(K65R,K490R), PML-K490(K65R,K160R), and PML-K65(K160R,K490R)) as substrates. These mutants had only a single Lys residue left for SUMO modification, thus allowing for a detailed mapping of substrate specificity. Both SENP1 and SENP5 could remove SUMO-1, -2, or -3 from the Lys65 site of PML (Fig. 5). Thus, protease activity of SENP5 is not restricted to SUMO-2 and SUMO-3. However, when SUMO-1 was co-expressed with PML-K160(K65R,K490R) or PML-K490(K65R,K160R), SENP5 could not remove SUMO-1 from the Lys160 or Lys490 conjugation sites (Fig. 5), whereas SENP1 could readily remove SUMO-1 from these two sites. Thus, the ability of SENP5 to deconjugate SUMO-1 is limited to the Lys65 site of PML. Interestingly, SENP5 could remove SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 from the Lys160 and Lys490 conjugation sites (Fig. 5). Thus, SENP5 can remove SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 from Lys160 or Lys490. Preference of SENP3 for SUMO-2 and SUMO-3—Because SENP3 is closely related to SENP5, we next tested whether SENP3 has a substrate specificity like that of SENP5, using a protocol similar to that used to detect the desumoylation activity of SENP5. As shown in Fig. 6, when HA-tagged SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 was co-expressed with RGS-tagged SENP3, a major portion of higher molecular weight SUMO conjugates was removed. Replacement of the wild-type SENP3 with a SENP3(C532A) mutant significantly increased the expression of the SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 conjugates, suggesting that this SENP3 mutant functions as a dominant-negative protein. The expression levels of both SENP3 and the SENP3(C532A) catalytic mutant were then determined and shown to be identical in all lanes, thus ruling out the possibility that the differences were due to differences in the expression of the wild-type and mutant protease (Fig. 6). The activity of SENP3 was further determined to be specific for SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 because it could not process Ub, NEDD8, or SUMO-1 conjugates. Thus, SENP3 appears to also be specific for SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 conjugates, but not for SUMO-1. To further define the specificity of SENP3, we used PML-K65, PML-K160, or PML-K490 as a substrate. Both SENP3 and SENP5 could remove SUMO-1 from the Lys65 site of PML (Fig. 7). In addition, when SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 was co-expressed with SENP3, SENP3 demonstrated substrate specificity similar to that of SENP5 (Fig. 7). Finally, to determine whether SENP3 or SENP5 has the ability to remove mono-SUMO-2 from PML, HA-tagged SUMO-2 was co-expressed with RGS-tagged PML-K160. Unmodified PML-K160 and HA-SUMO-2-modified PML-K160 were precipitated with TALON beads and blotted with either anti-RGS (Fig. 8, left panel) or anti-HA antibodies (right panel). As shown, either SENP3 or SENP5 can remove SUMO-2 from SUMO-2-PML-K160, whereas SENP3 or SENP5 catalytic mutants could not. Sumoylation is a reversible process that is regulated by a family of SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) (2Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene. 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). From the standpoint of sequence homology, the SENP family can be divided into four subfamilies. All SENPs share a conserved catalytic domain, starting from the sequence DXXTL to EXXXXXL at the C-terminal end. The catalytic domain of SENP1 is 59, 42, and 44% identical to that of SENP2, SENP3, and SENP5, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, SENP1 and SENP2 share a conserved sequence (MEKEIXXXXXXGXQDEíL-SXAF-XXXITR) preceding their catalytic domain and thus constitute the first SENP subfamily. The third subfamily of the SENPs consists of SENP6 and SENP7, which have a long insertion in their conserved catalytic domain. The fourth subfamily has one member, SENP8; although SENP8 shares the SENP catalytic domain, it is actually active against NEDD8 conjugates. One of the reasons why SENP8 may not be able to process SUMO conjugates is that SENP8 lacks some of the SUMO-binding sites (33Reverter D. Wu K. Erdene T.G. Pan Z.Q. Wilkinson K.D. Lima C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In particular, the side chains of Arg456 and Trp457 of SENP2 interact with the conserved SUMO-1 β3-β4 loop. However, Met and Phe are substituted in these sites in SENP8. SENP2 Phe441, which is identical within the rest of the SENP family members but is substituted to Glu in SENP8, appears important for the interaction between SENP2 and SUMO-1 (34Reverter D. Lima C.D. Structure (Camb.). 2004; 12: 1519-1531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In keeping with other findings, our current study suggests that the SENP subfamilies are functionally distinct as well. In particular, we found that SENP3 and SENP5 prefer SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 conjugates, but not SUMO-1 conjugates. This is unlike SENP1 and SENP2, which can process all of the SUMO substrates in vivo (21Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 25Zhang H. Saitoh H. Matunis M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6498-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 26Hang J. Dasso M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19961-19966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Of the four members of the SUMO family that have been identified, SUMO-2, -3, and -4 are closely related, whereas SUMO-1 is distantly related to the other three SUMOs. In addition, using an antibody that recognizes SUMO-2 and -3, but not SUMO-1, it was shown that SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 account for a greater percentage of total cellular protein modification than does SUMO-1 (35Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). It was further shown that there is a large pool of free, non-conjugated SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 and that the conjugation of SUMO-2 or SUMO-3 to high molecular mass proteins was induced when cells were subjected to protein-damaging stimuli such as acute temperature fluctuations (35Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). It also appears that different SUMOs have different substrates. For example, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 are conjugated poorly, if at all, to a major SUMO-1 substrate, the Ran GTPase-activating protein RanGAP1 (35Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Further, in experiments using a proteomics approach, SUMO-1 was shown to have different substrates from those of SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 (36Rosas-Acosta G. Russell W.K. Deyrieux A. Russell D.H. Wilson V.G. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 56-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 37Vertegaal A.C. Ogg S.C. Jaffray E. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Lamond A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33791-33798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Thus, the existence of a particular SENP subfamily with a preference for SUMO-2 and SUMO-3, but not for SUMO-1, would allow for more specific regulation of these substrates. In this study, we did not use SUMO-4 as a modifier because full-length SUMO-4 cannot be processed to reveal the di-Gly-Gly residues and cannot be conjugated to any substrates (9Owerbach D. McKay E.M. Yeh E.T. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As noted earlier, SENPs can also be distinguished on the basis of their subcellular localizations. For example, SENP1 localizes to the nucleus, excluding the nucleolus, whereas SENP2 localizes to the nuclear envelope (21Gong L. Millas S. Maul G.G. Yeh E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 25Zhang H. Saitoh H. Matunis M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6498-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 26Hang J. Dasso M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19961-19966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). SENP3 localizes to the nucleolus, whereas SENP6 localizes to the cytosol (29Nishida T. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6423-6427Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Kim K.I. Baek S.H. Jeon Y.J. Nishimori S. Suzuki T. Uchida S. Shimbara N. Saitoh H. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14102-14106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found SENP5 to also be highly enriched in the nucleolus. The nucleolus is a dynamic structure that disassembles and reforms during each cell cycle around the rRNA gene clusters (38Shaw P.J. Jordan E.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 93-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). More than 200 different proteins have been identified in nucleolus preparations (39Scherl A. Coute Y. Deon C. Calle A. Kindbeiter K. Sanchez J.C. Greco A. Hochstrasser D. Diaz J.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4100-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Several of these participate in the processing of preribosomal RNA and in the modification and assembly of mature ribosome subunits, but the functions of many are uncharacterized or are associated with extranucleolar activity. In the nucleolus, more than 20 subsets of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins form large complexes with primary RNA polymerase II transcripts, which play important roles in regulating multiple steps in mRNA biogenesis. Five subsets of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins have been demonstrated to be modified by SUMO (40Vassileva M.T. Matunis M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3623-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of both SENP3 and SENP5 in the nucleolus may eliminate the SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 modification of nucleolar proteins, while allowing SUMO-1 conjugates to persist. In conclusion, we have defined two subfamilies of the SENPs. SENP1 and SENP2 are active against SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and SUMO-3, whereas SENP3 and SENP5 prefer SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W2085652779,"Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are a family of neuron-enriched proteins that regulate neurite outgrowth and growth cone dynamics. Here, we show that Cdk5 phosphorylates CRMP1, CRMP2, and CRMP4, priming for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3 in vitro. In contrast, DYRK2 phosphorylates and primes CRMP4 only. The Cdk5 and DYRK2 inhibitor purvalanol decreases the phosphorylation of CRMP proteins in neurons, whereas CRMP1 and CRMP2, but not CRMP4, phosphorylation is decreased in Cdk5–/– cortices. Stimulation of neuroblastoma cells with IGF1 or TPA decreases GSK3 activity concomitantly with CRMP2 and CRMP4 phosphorylation. Conversely, increased GSK3 activity is not sufficient to increase CRMP phosphorylation. However, the growth cone collapse-inducing protein Sema3A increases Cdk5 activity and promotes phosphorylation of CRMP2 (but not CRMP4). Therefore, inhibition of GSK3 alters phosphorylation of all CRMP isoforms; however, individual isoforms can be differentially regulated by their respective priming kinase. This is the first GSK3 substrate found to be regulated in this manner and may explain the hyperphosphorylation of CRMP2 observed in Alzheimer's disease.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). GSK3 is unusual when compared with other protein kinases as it is constitutively active in cells and phosphorylation of most substrates must be preceded by phosphorylation of a nearby residue by another kinase. This process is known as priming and occurs at Ser/Thr residues located 4 or 5 residues C-terminal to the site phosphorylated by GSK3 (2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 3Cole A.R. Knebel A. Morrice N.A. Robertson L.A. Irving A.J. Connolly C.N. Sutherland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50176-50180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). GSK3 activity is inhibited by phosphorylation of an N-terminal serine residue (Ser21 on GSK3α and Ser9 on GSK3β), which is catalyzed by members of the AGC family of protein kinases upon stimulation by growth factors (4Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 5Frame S. Cohen P. Biondi R.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1321-1327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GSK3 activity may be inhibited by protein-protein interactions following activation of the Wnt signaling pathway (6Liu X. Rubin J.S. Kimmel A.R. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1989-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 7Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It is also possible that regulation of priming kinases could indirectly regulate phosphorylation of substrates by GSK3, although this has yet to be proven. We have recently discovered new brain-specific substrates for GSK3, namely collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) 2 and 4 (3Cole A.R. Knebel A. Morrice N.A. Robertson L.A. Irving A.J.

These isoforms are members of a family of five CRMP proteins (CRMP1–5) that are expressed almost ubiquitously throughout the central nervous system (8Wang L.H. Strittmatter S.M. J.

Mammalian CRMP2 binds to tubulin heterodimers to promote microtubule formation and co-localizes with microtubules inside cells (10Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Menager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T.

Importantly, hyperphosphorylated CRMP2 has been detected within neurofibriliary tangles from the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and the residues hyperphosphorylated match those phosphorylated by GSK3 (3Cole A.R.

Hamajima N. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4267-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast to CRMP2, relatively little is known about the function of the other CRMP isoforms. Human CRMP1–4 are ∼572 amino acids in length, 62 kDa in size and share a high level of sequence homology (>80%), whereas CRMP5 (or CRAM) is more divergent. All CRMP isoforms are members of the amidohydrolase family of structural proteins, although they do not possess any amidohydrolase enzymatic activity (19Wang L.H. Strittmatter S.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The residues in CRMP2 phosphorylated by GSK3 (Ser518, Thr514, and Thr509) as well as the priming site (Ser522) are conserved in human CRMP1 and CRMP4, but not in CRMP3 (Fig. 1) or CRMP5 (not shown). Although CRMP2 and CRMP4 have been identified as GSK3 substrates (3Cole A.R. Knebel A. Morrice N.A. Robertson L.A. Irving A.J. Connolly C.N. Sutherland C. J. Biol.

However, it is not yet established if this is the priming kinase for all of the CRMP isoforms in vivo. In this report we demonstrate for the first time differences in the priming mechanisms for CRMP1, CRMP2, and CRMP4 that make this class of GSK3 substrates unique among the fifty or so reported to date. This novel regulation has implications for the mechanism by which CRMP2 becomes hyperphosphorylated in AD. In addition, we compare the effect of overexpression of CRMP isoforms on axon elongation in neurons. Materials—Generation of the Cdk5–/– (20Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G.

Phosphospecific antibodies that recognize CRMP isoforms phosphorylated at Thr509 (or Thr509 and Thr514 for CRMP2) were generated by injecting sheep with the following phosphopeptides that were conjugated separately to both bovine serum albumin and keyhole limpet hemocyanin; CRMP1, YEVPApTPKYATPAP; CRMP2, CEVSVpTPKTVpTPAS; CRMP4, FDLTTpTPKGGTPAG (where pT is phosphothreonine) (Diagnostics Scotland, Pennycuick, UK). Antisera were affinity-purified on a phosphopeptide antigen-Sepharose column. For immunoblotting, each antibody was diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) skim milk and 1 μm unphosphorylated peptide. The cross-reactivity of each antibody was assessed by dot blot, and each was found to be specific for the appropriate isoform. An antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of CRMP2 equally well was generated by injecting sheep with glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged CRMP2. The antiserum was affinity purified on GST-CRMP2-Sepharose following preclearing on GST-Sepharose. It was further purified using GST-CRMP1/4-Sepharose to remove antibodies that recognized CRMP1 and CRMP4. Anti-CRMP1 and anti-CRMP4 antibodies were purchased from Upstate and Chemicon, respectively. The GSK3-specific inhibitor CT99021 (see Ref. 23Wagman A.S. Johnson K.W. Bussiere D.E. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1105-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. Rodolfo Marquez, School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, while purvalanol was purchased from Calbiochem. Sema3A-conditioned medium was generated by Dr. Britta Eickholt (King's College, London, UK) as previously described (24Eickholt B.J. Morrow R. Walsh F.S. Doherty P. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 358-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), whereas Wnt3A-conditioned medium was supplied by Dr. Xu Huang (University of Dundee). IGF1 was purchased from Invitrogen (Paisley, UK). Cloning, Mutagenesis, and Protein Expression—The cDNA-encoding full-length human CRMP1 was amplified by PCR from Image clone 3533444 using the primers 5′-GGGCAAGAAGAGCATCCCGCACATCACG-3′ and 5′-CGTGATGTGCGGGATGCTCTTCTTGCCC. Cloning of human CRMP2 and CRMP4 is described previously (3Cole A.R. Knebel A. Morrice N.A. Robertson L.A. Irving A.J. Connolly C.N. Sutherland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50176-50180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Each 5′ primer introduced a FLAG tag to the N termini of each CRMP isoform. The PCR products were subcloned into pRK5 for mammalian or pGEX-6 for bacterial expression. Mutants of CRMP isoforms were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All cloning was confirmed by direct sequencing. Recombinant human CRMP isoforms and DYRK2 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells as GST-tagged proteins, His6-GSK3β was expressed in Sf21 cells and the His6-Cdk5/GST-p35 complex was purchased from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). Cell Culture—Human SH-SY5Y and N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Primary hippocampal or cortical cultures were prepared from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups or E17 wild-type and Cdk5 transgenic mice and analyzed as previously described (3Cole A.R. Knebel A.

All cell types were transfected using Lipofectamine2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—Recombinant GST-tagged wild-type and S522A mutant CRMP proteins (1 μm) were phosphorylated using GST-DYRK2 or a His6-Cdk5/p35 complex in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.03% (v/v) Brij-35, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm ATP at 30 °C for the times indicated. For priming experiments, GST-DYRK2 and His6-Cdk5/p35 were removed from the reaction mixture by addition of Ni2+-agarose (DYRK2 has an endogenous poly(His) sequence). The supernatant was incubated with 2.5 milliunits/μl His6-GSK3β, 50 nm [γ-32P]ATP, and additional unlabeled MgATP (to a final concentration of 10 mm MgCl2/0.1 mm ATP) at 30 °C for the times indicated. Reactions were terminated by addition of SDS, subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane and autoradiographed. 32P-Labeled CRMP bands were excised from the membrane and analyzed by Cerenkov counting. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation was calculated from the amount of radioactivity (calculated from the specific activity of the [γ-32P]ATP), incorporated into a known amount of the CRMP proteins. It is presented as the number of mol of phosphate incorporated per mol of CRMP. CRMP2 and CRMP4 Are Phosphorylated at Ser522 by Different Kinases in Vitro—Analysis of the sequences surrounding Ser522 of human CRMP1, CRMP2 and CRMP4 suggests that the priming kinase for each isoform is likely to be a proline-directed kinase, because of the strict conservation of Pro523 (Fig. 1). Recent work has implicated cyclindependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), as a potential physiological priming kinase for CRMP2, partly because phosphorylation of CRMP2 was reduced upon coincubation of neurons with roscovitine or olomoucine (12Yoshimura T.

Takei K. Ihara Y. Mikoshiba K. Kolattukudy P. Honnorat J. Goshima Y. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). However, in addition to Cdk5 and other Cdks, these compounds inhibit the activity of members of the dual tyrosine-regulated kinase (DYRK) family of proline-directed kinases (25Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), and we have previously shown that DYRK2 is able to phosphorylate Ser522 of CRMP4, thereby priming for subsequent phosphorylation of Ser518, Thr514, and Thr509 by GSK3 in vitro (3Cole A.R. Knebel A. Morrice N.A. Robertson L.A. Irving A.J. Connolly C.N. Sutherland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50176-50180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To determine if either or both of these kinases are able to prime each CRMP isoform for phosphorylation by GSK3, we compared their phosphorylation in vitro by recombinant Cdk5 and DYRK2. Cdk5 was able to phosphorylate CRMP4 efficiently (Fig. 2A, upper panel), incorporating 0.57 mol of phosphate per mol of CRMP4 after 1 h at 30 °C. This was significantly less than the amount of phosphate incorporated by DYRK2 (lower panel), which was 1.51 mol of phosphate per mol of CRMP4. Almost no phosphate was incorporated into CRMP4[S522A] by Cdk5 (Fig. 2B), indicating that the primary phosphorylation site in CRMP4 targeted by Cdk5 is likely to be Ser522. DYRK2 also phosphorylates CRMP4 at Ser522, because less than half the phosphate was incorporated into the mutant compared with wild-type CRMP4 (Fig. 2B). Next, we performed in vitro linked phosphorylation assays to determine if Cdk5 was able to prime CRMP4 for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3. CRMP4 was first incubated with Cdk5 in the presence of unlabeled ATP for 1 h at 30 °C. Following removal of Cdk5 using Ni2+-agarose, the primed CRMP4 was incubated with recombinant GSK3β in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP for up to 2 h. Cdk5-primed CRMP4 (Fig. 2C, upper panel) was a better substrate for subsequent GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation than unprimed CRMP4 (lower panel). The stoichiometry of phosphorylation approached 1 mol of phosphate per mole of CRMP4 (Fig. 2D). This result was similar to GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of DYRK2-primed CRMP4 (3Cole A.R. Knebel A. Morrice N.A. Robertson L.A. Irving A.J. Connolly C.N. Sutherland C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50176-50180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The ability of Cdk5 and DYRK2 to phosphorylate and prime CRMP2 was also investigated. GST-CRMP2 was found to be an excellent substrate for both Cdk5 and DYRK2, with 0.40 and 1.07 mol of phosphate per mol of CRMP2 being incorporated after a 1 h of incubation, respectively (Fig. 3A). The amount of phosphate incorporated into wild-type CRMP2 using Cdk5 was significantly greater than the amount of phosphate incorporated into CRMP2[S522A] (Fig. 3B), indicating that Ser522 is the major phosphorylation site for Cdk5 in vitro. In contrast, the amount of phosphate incorporated into CRMP2[S522A] using DYRK2 was significant, indicating that Ser522 is not the only phosphorylation site for DYRK2. In a linked kinase assay, Cdk5-phosphorylated CRMP2 (Fig. 3C, upper panel) was a better substrate for GSK3β than unprimed CRMP2 (lower panel), with the stoichiometry of phosphorylation approaching 1 mol of phosphate/mol of CRMP2, (see Fig. 3D). In contrast, DYRK2 does not prime CRMP2 effectively for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3β (data not shown). In summary, Cdk5 is able to phosphorylate Ser522 on CRMP2 and CRMP4 and prime for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3β at Ser518, Thr514, and Thr509. DYRK2, on the other hand, is able to phosphorylate and prime CRMP4, but not CRMP2. These observations demonstrate that Cdk5 is a candidate priming kinase (at Ser522) for CRMP2 and CRMP4, whereas DYRK2 is an additional candidate for CRMP4 only. CRMP1 Is a Substrate for GSK3 in Human, but Not Rodent, Neuronal Cells—Using in vitro kinase assays and pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 as described above for CRMP2 and CRMP4, it was found that Thr509 (and presumably Ser518 and Thr514) of human CRMP1 is phosphorylated by GSK3, following priming of Ser522 by Cdk5 (supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, phosphorylation of mouse or rat CRMP1 was not altered in cortical neurons treated with CT99021 (supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that rodent CRMP1 is not a substrate of GSK3, presumably because of the presence of Ala514. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of CRMP1 at Thr509 was dramatically reduced upon treatment of rat cortical neurons with purvalanol and in Cdk5+/– and Cdk5–/– neurons compared with wild-type neurons (supplementary Fig. S3, A and B), suggesting that this residue might be directly phosphorylated by Cdk5. This was supported by phosphorylation of CRMP1 at Thr509 by Cdk5 in vitro (supplementary Fig. S3C). In summary, phosphorylation of Thr509 of human CRMP1 appears to be regulated by two mechanisms; direct phosphorylation by Cdk5, or by priming of Ser522 by Cdk5 followed by sequential phosphorylation of Ser518, Thr514, and Thr509 by GSK3. In rodents, phosphorylation of Thr509 cannot be achieved by the latter mechanism, hence Thr509 is phosphorylated directly by Cdk5. DYRK2 did not phosphorylate Ser522 of human or rodent CRMP1 and did not prime for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3 (data not shown). Cdk5 Primes CRMP2, but Not CRMP4, for GSK3-mediated Phosphorylation in Vivo—Primary rat cortical neurons were treated with purvalanol, a more potent inhibitor of Cdk5 and DYRK2 than roscovitine (25Bain J. McLauchlan H. Elliott M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was monitored using antibodies that specifically recognize CRMP2 when phosphorylated at Thr514/Thr509, or CRMP4 when phosphorylated at Thr509. Loss of phosphorylation of Ser522 will prevent subsequent phosphorylation of Ser518/Thr514/Thr509 by GSK3. Incubation of neurons for 48 h with purvalanol caused significant, inhibition of CRMP2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4). This treatment also reduced the phosphorylation of Thr509 of CRMP4. Extended incubation of neurons with purvalanol (≥24 h) was necessary to observe CRMP dephosphorylation. The decrease in phosphorylation of both proteins was accompanied by a partial band shift to a lower relative molecular weight on SDS-PAGE (lower panels). The modification to CRMP2/4 causing this band shift is not yet known, although it is unlikely to be caused by dephosphorylation alone, because similar band shifts were not observed in other experiments that reduce CRMP phosphorylation (e.g. Figs. 5 and 6). CRMP2-Thr509/514 phosphorylation was also significantly reduced in Cdk5–/– cortices compared with wild-type or Cdk5+/– heterozygous mice (reduced by an average of 55%, n = 3, p < 0.005, Fig. 5A). In contrast, phosphorylation of CRMP4 was identical in wild-type, Cdk5+/– Cdk5–/– cortices, suggesting that Cdk5 is not required for Ser522 phosphorylation of CRMP4 in vivo. However, treatment of primary cortical neurons from Cdk5–/– mice with purvalanol reduced CRMP4 phosphorylation (data not shown), implicating DYRK2 (or possibly another Cdk) as a priming kinase for CRMP4.FIGURE 5Phosphorylation of CRMP2, but not CRMP4, is decreased in Cdk5–/– cortex. A, cortices from wild type (+/+), Cdk5 heterozygous (+/–) or Cdk5 knock-out (–/–) mice were homogenized and subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with antibodies that recognize CRMP2 phosphorylated at Thr514 and Thr509 or CRMP4 phosphorylated at Thr509 (upper panels), and antibodies that recognize unphosphorylated and phosphorylated CRMP2 or CRMP4 equally well (middle panels). Membranes were also immunoblotted with an antibody that recognizes actin as a loading control (lower panels). B, cultures of cortical neurons from wild type (+/+) and Cdk5 knock-out (–/–) mice were treated without (–) or with (+)2 μm CT99021 for 4 h.

The optical densities of these bands were determined, and the ratio of phosphorylated CRMP2/4:CRMP2/4 are shown as a graph in H (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because phosphorylation of CRMP2 was not completely inhibited in Cdk5–/– cortex, this suggested that another Ser522 kinase(s) exists that partially compensates for the loss of Cdk5. Alternatively, Thr514/Thr509 may be directly phosphorylated by kinases other than GSK3. To investigate the latter possibility, primary cultures of cortical neurons from wild-type and Cdk5–/– mice were incubated with or without the GSK3 inhibitor CT99021 (Fig. 5B). Inhibition of GSK3 decreased Thr514/Thr509 phosphorylation of CRMP2 and Thr509 phosphorylation of CRMP4 in cortical neurons from wild-type and Cdk5–/– mice (80 and 55%, respectively), indicating that the remaining phosphorylation of these residues in the brains of Cdk5–/– mice is mediated by GSK3 following partial priming at Ser522 of CRMP2 by a compensatory kinase(s). This is supported by in vitro studies that show phosphorylation of unprimed CRMP2 by GSK3 is negligible. The identity of the alternative priming kinase for CRMP2 is not yet known. Inhibition, but Not Elevation, of GSK3 Activity Regulates CRMP Phosphorylation in Vivo—Inhibition of GSK3 in neurons using the specific inhibitor CT99021 produces a dramatic inhibition of CRMP2 and CRMP4 phosphorylation at Thr514/509 and Thr509, respectively (Fig. 5B and Ref. 3Cole A.R.

Incubation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with IGF1 or TPA inhibits GSK3 activity via phosphorylation of an inhibitory N-terminal serine residue on GSK3 by PKB and PKC, respectively (2Frame S.

It also plays a key role in bone homeostasis and is a clinically effective therapeutic agent for osteoporosis. We previously demonstrated that vitamin K2 is a transcriptional regulator of bone marker genes in osteoblastic cells and that it may potentiate bone formation by activating the steroid and xenobiotic receptor, SXR. To explore the SXR-mediated vitamin K2 signaling network in bone homeostasis, we identified genes up-regulated by both vitamin K2 and the prototypical SXR ligand, rifampicin, in osteoblastic cells using oligonucleotide microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Fourteen genes were up-regulated by both ligands. Among these, tsukushi, matrilin-2, and CD14 antigen were shown to be primary SXR target genes. Moreover, collagen accumulation in osteoblastic MG63 cells was enhanced by vitamin K2 treatment. Gain- and loss-of-function analyses showed that the small leucine-rich proteoglycan, tsukushi, contributes to vitamin K2-mediated enhancement of collagen accumulation. Our results suggest a new function for vitamin K2 in bone formation as a transcriptional regulator of extracellular matrix-related genes, that are involved in the collagen assembly.

Vitamin K is an important cofactor in blood coagulation and also known as a potent stimulator of the bone building process. Vitamin K is a family of structurally similar, fat-soluble, 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinones, including phylloquinone (K1), menaquinones (K2), and menadione (K3). Vitamin K1 and vitamin K2 are natural vitamin Ks. The former is found in plants, whereas the latter is mainly derived from animal sources and produced by intestinal bacteria. In vitro studies showed that vitamin K2 is far more active than K1 in both promoting bone formation and reducing bone loss (1Akedo Y. Hosoi T. Inoue S. Ikegami A. Mizuno Y. Kaneki M. Nakamura T.

Lamson D.W. Altern. Med. Rev. 2005; 10: 24-35PubMed Google Scholar). In vitamin K-dependent carboxylation reactions, the reduced form of vitamin K de-protonates glutamate via the γ-glutamyl carboxylase and the reduced vitamin K is converted to vitamin K epoxide. Two such vitamin K-dependent proteins were identified in bone: osteocalcin and matrix Gla protein (MGP). Osteocalcin is a bone protein only synthesized in osteoblasts and odontoblasts. It serves as a good biochemical marker of the metabolic turnover of bone because the osteocalcin lacking Gla residues cannot bind to hydroxyapatite, one of the major components of bone matrix (9Price P.A. Baukol S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11660-11663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of under-carboxylated osteocalcin increase during aging and significantly correlates with fracture risk (10Vergnaud P. Garnero P. Meunier P.J. Breart G. Kamihagi K. Delmas P.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Therefore, vitamin K-modified osteocalcin plays an important role in bone homeostasis. In contrast to osteocalcin, MGP is predominantly expressed in chondrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Mgp-deficient mice exhibited inappropriate calcification of various cartilages as well as arterial walls, indicating that MGP is a modulator of extracellular matrix mineralization (11Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar, 12Murshed M. Schinke T. McKee M.D. Karsenty G. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Despite structural similarities between osteocalcin and MGP, these two Gla proteins exhibit different functions. These findings suggest that vitamin K plays a significant role in bone homeostasis, although the precise mechanisms through which bone Gla proteins regulate homeostasis are complex. During the 60-year history of vitamin K research, most of the attention has been paid to the actions of vitamin K on γ-carboxylation. We recently identified a novel mechanism of vitamin K functions via transcriptional regulation in osteoblastic cells (13Tabb M.M. Sun A. Zhou C. Grun F. Errandi J. Romero K. Pham H. Inoue S. Mallick S. Lin M. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43919-43927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Both vitamin K2 and the known SXR ligands rifampicin (RIF) and hyperforin up-regulated expression of the prototypical SXR target gene CYP3A4 and bone markers such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and MGP (13Tabb M.M. Sun A. Zhou C. Grun F. Errandi J. Romero K. Pham H. Inoue S. Mallick S. Lin M. Forman B.M. Blumberg B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43919-43927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Our findings suggested an important role for vitamin K2-dependent transcriptional regulation in bone homeostasis. Until now, the contribution of distinct vitamin K2 and SXR target genes to these mechanisms remained to be studied. In the present study, we searched for SXR target genes induced by vitamin K2 and RIF in osteoblastic MG63 cells using microarray analysis. Several genes were identified that are up-regulated by both agonists. We focused here on the osteoblastogenic functions of extracellular matrix-related genes as SXR targets in response to vitamin K2 treatment. Furthermore, we showed that the novel SXR target, tsukushi (TSK), plays a role in collagen accumulation in MG63 cells. Our findings indicate that vitamin K2 activates SXR to regulate the transcription of extracellular matrix-related genes that may contribute to collagen assembly. Cell Culture—MG63 human osteosarcoma cells, 293T, and COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplement with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Prior to vitamin K2 treatment, cells were cultured in phenol red-free media containing 10% dextran-charcoal-stripped FBS. Cloning and Construction of cDNAs—Human SXR (pCDG-SXR), human SXR containing the VP16 activation domain upstream to SXR (VP16-SXR), and tk-(3A4)3-Luc containing three-copy SXR response elements from human cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4 promoter were described previously (14Blumberg B.

N-terminally FLAG-tagged pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) plasmids containing SXR (pcDNA3-FLAG-SXR) and VP16C-SXR (pcDNA3-FLAG-VP16C-SXR) were generated by PCR using pCDG-SXR and VP16-SXR as templates, respectively, and inserted in-frame to FLAG-tagged pcDNA3 at EcoRI and XhoI sites. VP16C-SXR contained 20 amino acids from the C terminus of VP16 activation domain upstream of SXR. The tsukushi (TSK) cDNA was isolated from first-strand cDNA derived from MG63 cells using primers 5′-CACGAATTCGCCACCATGCCGTGGCCCCTGCTG-3′ and 5′-CGACTCGAGCAAGATGGTGGGGCCCCTGGC-3′, inserted inframe to C-terminally FLAG-tagged pcDNA3 at EcoRI and XhoI sites (pcDNA3-TSK-FLAG). DNA sequences of plasmids were determined by ABI PRIZM 377 Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Luciferase Assay—Luciferase assay was performed using MG63 cells (2 × 104 cells/well on 24-well plates) transfected with 115 ng of tk-(3A4)3-Luc, 130 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega), and 5 ng of FLAG-pcDNA3 or FLAG-tagged SXR plasmids using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 20 μm RIF (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), 20 μm MK-4 (gifted by Eisai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), or vehicle (0.2% ethanol) for 30 h in fresh media, and luciferase activities were determined by a MicroLumatPlus microplate luminometer (Berthold Technologies) using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase, which was used as a transfection control. The experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Generation of Stable Cell Lines—MG63 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-SXR, pcDNA3-FLAG-VP16C-SXR, pcDNA3-TSK-FLAG, or empty FLAG-tagged pcDNA3 using the FuGENE 6 reagent and selected in 0.5 mg/ml G418. Expression levels of FLAG-SXR, FLAG-VP16C-SXR, and TSK-FLAG proteins were verified by Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Whole cell lysates were prepared using PLC lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentrations were analyzed using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 90 min followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 30 min. After extensive washing, the antibody-antigen complexes were detected using the Western blotting Chemiluminescence Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies used included anti-PXR (pregnane X receptor)/SXR (N-16 and H-160, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories), anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). For SXR detection in parental MG63 cells, 500 μg of proteins from cell lysates were incubated with anti-SXR antibody (H-160) or normal rabbit IgG (Sigma) at 4°C overnight. The mixture of cell extracts and antibody was incubated with Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4°C for 2 h, washed four times using PLC lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Preparation of cRNA—Total RNA was extracted from MG63 cells stably expressing FLAG-VP16C-SXR treated with vehicle (0.1% ethanol), MK-4 (10 μm), or RIF (10 μm) for 48 h. The methods for preparation of cRNA and subsequent steps leading to hybridization and scanning of the U133A GeneChip Arrays were provided by the manufacturer (Affymetrix). Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from 200 μg total RNA of each sample with the Oligotex™-dT30 Super mRNA purification kit (Takara Bio, Kyoto, Japan) and converted into double-stranded cDNA using the cDNA synthesis kit (SuperScript Choice, Invitrogen) with a special oligo(dT)24 primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site added 3′ of the poly(T) tract (Amersham Biosciences). After second-strand synthesis, labeled cRNA was generated from the cDNA sample by an in vitro transcription reaction using the bioarray high yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) supplemented with biotin-CTP and biotin-UTP (Enzo Life Sciences). The labeled cRNA was purified using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen). Twenty μg of each cRNA sample was fragmented by mild alkaline treatment, at 94°C for 35 min in fragmentation buffer (200 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.1, 500 mm potassium acetate, 150 mm magnesium acetate) and then used to prepare 400 μl of master hybridization mix (0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA (Promega), 0.5 mg/ml of acetylated bovine serum albumin in hybridization buffer containing 100 mm MES, 1 m [Na+], 20 mm EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20). Oligonucleotide Array Hybridization and Scanning—Before hybridization, the cRNA samples were heated to 99°C for 5 min, equilibrated to 45°C for 5 min, and clarified by centrifugation (15,000 rpm) at room temperature for 5 min. Aliquots of each sample (10 μg of cRNA in 200 μl of the master mix) were hybridized to U133A GeneChip arrays at 45°C for 16 h in a rotisserie oven set at 60 rpm. After this, the arrays were washed with non-stringent wash buffer (6 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA, 0.01% Tween 20) and stringent wash buffer (100 mm MES/0.1 M [Na+], 0.01% Tween 20), stained with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes), washed again, and read using a microarray scanner G2500A (Affymetrix) with the 570-nm long-pass filter. Data analysis was performed by using Affymetrix Microarray Suite software. For comparing arrays, normalization was performed using data from all probe sets. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—MG63 cells were treated with 10 μm RIF, 10 μm MK-4, or vehicle for indicated times. Total RNA was isolated using the ISOGEN reagent (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). First strand cDNA was generated from RNase-free DNase I-treated total RNA by using the SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT)20 primer. For PCR amplification, the primer sequences were: human TSK, 5′-CTGAGCGACGTGAACCTTAGC-3′ and 5′-CCTGACTGTGCGTCGTGAAG-3′; human MATN2, 5′-ACAGATCCTTTGCCTGTCAGTGT-3′ and 5′-GGTCCCCCAGAGCACAAGA-3′; human CD14,5′-GACTGATGGCGGCTCTCTGT-3′ and 5′-TGTGGGCGTCTCCATTCC-3′; human CYP3A4, 5′-TTCAGCCCATCTCCTTTCATATTT-3′ and 5′-CAGTTGGGTGTTGAGGATGGA-3′; human GAPDH, 5′-GCCTGCCTGACCAAATGC-3′ and 5′-GTGGTCGTTGAGGGCAATG-3′. mRNAs were quantified by real-time PCR using SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) and the ABI Prism 7000 system (Applied Biosystems) based on SYBR Green I fluorescence. The evaluation of relative differences of PCR product amounts among the treatment groups was carried out by the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method, using GAPDH as an external control (17Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). The experiments were independently repeated at least three times, each performed in triplicate. For cycloheximide treatment, cells were preincubated with the compound (10 μg/ml) 2 h prior to the stimulation by SXR ligands. RNA Interference—Small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes to target human SXR and TSK were synthesized by Qiagen (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). The siRNA target sequences were: SXR, 5′-GGCCACTGGCTATCACTTC-3′ (18Bhalla S. Ozalp C. Fang S. Xiang L. Kemper J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45139-45147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and TSK, 5′-CCTGCTCACCAGCATCTCA-3′. The siRNA specific to the luciferase gene (Luciferase GL2 Duplex, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) and nonspecific control VII (Dharmacon) was used as control. Cells were transfected with siRNA (70 nm) using GeneSilencer reagent (Genlantis, San Diego, CA) for 48 h, and further maintained in the culture medium containing 10% dextran-charcoal-stripped FBS with or without ligand stimulation for indicated times. Collagen Accumulation Assay by Sirius Red Staining—Cells were cultured until confluence (day 0), and the medium was replaced by the osteoblast differentiation medium (α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 5 mm β-glycerophosphate) with or without MK-4 (1 μm). Cells were fixed with Bouin's fluid (8.3% formaldehyde and 4.8% acetic acid in saturated aqueous picric acid) for 1 h at room temperature, rinsed with water, and stained with 1 mg/ml of sirius red dye (Direct Red 80) (Sigma) in saturated aqueous picric acid for 1 h. Cells were treated with 0.01 n HCl, and then the stain was extracted by 0.1 n NaOH. The absorbance of the dye solution was measured at 550 nm (19Tullberg-Reinert H. Jundt G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In experiments with warfarin [3-(α-acetonylbenzyl)-4-hydroxycoumarin, Sigma) treatment, cells at confluence were pretreated with vehicle or warfarin at 5 μm or 25 μm for 1 day, then treated with vehicle or vitamin K2 (1 μm) for another 3 days in the presence of warfarin (final concentration; 2.5 μm or 12.5 μm). In siRNA treatment experiments, cells were treated with the siRNA twice, 2 days before day 0 and on day 0. Statistical Analysis—Differences between two groups were analyzed using two-sample, two-tailed Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. All data are presented in the text and figures as the mean ± S.D. Construction of SXR Expression Vectors and Generation of Osteoblastic Cells Stably Expressing SXR—Our previous studies showed the direct effect of vitamin K2 on bone marker expression in osteoblastic cells. Although SXR is endogenously expressed in osteoblastic cells, it has been shown that the expression level is lower than that in cells derived from the intestine. Therefore, to identify vitamin K2 and SXR target genes in osteoblastic cells, we generated MG63 cells stably expressing SXR. These cells respond more robustly to SXR ligands than do wild type MG63 cells. We constructed two FLAG-tagged expression vectors containing full-length SXR (FLAG-SXR) and SXR fused to the C-terminal portion of the VP16 activation domain (FLAG-VP16C-SXR). Both vitamin K2 and RIF increased the transcriptional activity of the trimerized SXR response elements derived from the CYP3A4 promoter in MG63 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-SXR or FLAG-VP16C-SXR (Fig. 1A). We also constructed an expression vector fusing SXR to the full-length VP16 activation domain. This construct was constitutively active in the absence of ligand stimulation (data not shown). In contrast, FLAG-VP16C-SXR retained the ligand-dependent activation while it had substantial higher basal transcription level than FLAG-SXR. For further quantitative analysis of SXR actions in osteoblastic cells, we generated the stable cell lines expressing SXR constructs in MG63 cells. For either FLAG-SXR or FLAG-VP16C-SXR, we obtained two MG63 clones each with different expression levels (Fig. 1B). Identification of Genes Up-regulated by SXR Ligand in Osteoblastic Cells by GeneChip Analysis—To identify dual up-regulated genes by vitamin K2 and RIF treatment in osteoblastic cells, we prepared biotin-labeled cRNA samples from MG63 cells expressing FLAG-VP16C-SXR treated with vitamin K2, RIF, or vehicle. The Affymetrix U133A Gene-Chip array represents more than 18,000 human transcripts from ∼14,000 genes. Analysis of the MG63 samples was performed by hybridizing aliquots of cRNA to the GeneChip arrays. Seventy-seven transcripts were induced 2-fold or greater by vitamin K2, whereas 100 transcripts were induced by RIF. Eighteen transcripts were up-regulated by both SXR ligands. Therefore, we infer that these are potential SXR target genes. Table 1 shows the list of 18 transcripts from 14 distinct genes up-regulated by vitamin K2 and RIF. It is notable that a prototypical SXR-responsive gene ATP-binding cassette subfamily B or multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) (20Geick A. Eichelbaum M. Burk O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14581-14587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) was most significantly up-regulated by either vitamin K2 or RIF. Among these SXR target molecules, we were particularly interested in three genes due to their putative bone-related functions. There were a small leucine-rich proteoglycan named tsukushi (TSK), an extracellular matrix protein matrilin-2 (MATN2), and CD14 antigen.TABLE 1Dual up-regulated genes by 48-h treatment with vitamin K2 (10 μm) or RIF (10 μm) in MG63/FLAG-VP16C-SXR cells identified by GeneChip analysisProbe set IDEnsemble IDGene symbolDescription-Fold increase over controlVitamin K2RIF209994_s_atENSG00000085563ABCB1ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B (MDR/TAP), member 16.064.29209993_atENSG00000085563ABCB1ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B (MDR/TAP), member 14.294.00205357_s_atENSG00000144891AGTR1Angiotensin II receptor, type 12.832.46212938_atENSG00000142156COL6A1Collagen, type VI, α12.642.14201743_atENSG00000170458CD14CD14 antigen2.464.92209771_x_atENSG00000185275CD24CD24 antigen (small cell lung carcinoma cluster 4 antigen)2.462.30211839_s_atENSG00000184371CSF1Colony-stimulating factor 1 (macrophage)2.462.30212937_s_atENSG00000142156COL6A1Collagen, type VI, α12.462.14216379_x_atENSG00000185275CD24CD24 antigen (small cell lung carcinoma cluster 4 antigen)2.462.30202350_s_atENSG00000132561MATN2Matrilin-22.306.96203632_s_atENSG00000167191GPRC5BG protein-coupled receptor, family C, group 5, member B2.305.28211653_x_atENSG00000151632AKR1C2Aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C22.303.73218245_atENSG00000182704TSKLikely ortholog of chicken tsukushi2.302.64218854_atENSG00000111817SART2Squamous cell carcinoma antigen recognized by T cells 22.305.28210002_atENSG00000141448GATA6GATA-binding protein 62.142.14216594_x_atENSG00000187134AKR1C1Aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C12.143.73204151_x_atENSG00000187134AKR1C1Aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C12.003.48212268_atENSG00000021355SERPINB1Serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor, clade B (ovalbumin), member 12.002.83 Open table in a new tab Ligand-dependent Induction of SXR Target Genes in Osteoblastic Cells—We next validated whether mRNA expression levels for these three genes could be modulated by vitamin K2 and RIF in MG63 cells ectopically expressing either FLAG-VP16C-SXR or FLAG-SXR using quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2). All of the three SXR target genes, TSK, MATN2, and CD14, were up-regulated by SXR ligands. The time-dependent expression profiles of those genes in FLAG-VP16C-SXR and FLAG-SXR-expressing cells were quite similar, although the amplitude of induction was different in these cells. In both cell types, RIF generated stronger induction of mRNA expression than vitamin K2. Nevertheless, the maximal induction by vitamin K2 was greater than 2-fold for all three genes in both cell types. Transcriptional Regulation of SXR Target Genes in Osteoblastic Cells—We next asked whether the induction of SXR target genes was dependent on direct activation of transcription or required ongoing protein synthesis. MG63 cells overexpressing FLAG-SXR were treated with vitamin K2 or RIF in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. The ligand-dependent up-regulation of the three SXR target genes, including TSK, MATN2, and CD14, was not affected by cycloheximide treatment, indicating that the transcriptional regulation of those genes was independent of protein synthesis (Fig. 3A). To further demonstrate the requirement for SXR in the regulation of TSK, MATN2, and CD14, we investigated the effects of siRNA on the ligand-dependent induction of gene expression. Forty-eight hour treatment with a specific siRNA duplex against SXR (siRNA-SXR), but not with a control siRNA directed against luciferase (siRNA-Luc), reduced the SXR protein level by more than 60% in MG63/SXR clone #3 (Fig. 3B). The effectiveness of the SXR-specific siRNA was confirmed as the vitamin K2-induced up-regulation of CYP3A4 mRNA expression was diminished by the SXR siRNA in MG63/SXR clone #3 (Fig. 3C). In that cell system, the SXR siRNA significantly reduced either vitamin K2-or RIF-activated mRNA expression for TSK, MATN2, and CD14 (Fig. 3D). We next examined whether the SXR siRNA duplex reduced the endogenous expression of SXR protein (Fig. 4). The endogenous level of SXR protein in parental MG63 cells was barely detected in Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). Thus, we immunoprecipitated MG63 cell lysates with a polyclonal antibody against the hinge and a part of ligand-binding domain of SXR (H-160) and immunodetected SXR protein by another polyclonal antibody against the SXR N terminus (N-16). The enrichment of SXR protein in immunoprecipitated fraction was also confirmed in COS1 cells transiently transfected with FLAG-SXR (Fig. 4A). Based on this evaluation system, we could show that the SXR siRNA reduced the level of endogenous SXR protein in MG63 (Fig. 4B). Since we confirmed that the SXR siRNA duplex was effective to inhibit the endogenous expression of SXR protein, we next analyzed whether the SXR siRNA reduced the expression of the SXR target genes in parental MG63 cells. The SXR siRNA at 14 or 70 nm could significantly reduce endogenous SXR mRNA levels in natural MG63 cells (Fig. 4C). The expression of TSK, MATN2, and CD14 was all up-regulated by either vitamin K2 or RIF, indicating that the three genes were bona fide SXR targets in parental MG63 cells (Fig. 4D). This ligand-dependent induction of all three genes was significantly reduced by the SXR siRNA transfection in parental MG63 cells (Fig. 4D). Vitamin K2 and TSK Stimulate Collagen Accumulation in Osteoblastic Cells—TSK was recently identified as a bone morphogenic protein-binding protein that belongs to the small leucin-rich proteoglycan family (21Ohta K. Lupo G. Kuriyama S. Keynes R. Holt C.E. Harris W.A. Tanaka H. Ohnuma S. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which is implicated as an extracellular matrix component. Because small leucine-rich proteoglycans such as biglycan and decorin are known to interact with matrilin-1 in the cartilage extracellular matrix (22Wiberg C. Klatt A.R. Wagener R. Paulsson M. Bateman J.F. Heinegard D. Morgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37698-37704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), TSK and matrilin-1-related MATN2 are likely to be involved in the assembly of extracellular matrix, including collagens, in osteoblastic cells. We next asked whether vitamin K2 promoted collagen production or stabilized collagen levels. We evaluated collagen amounts by staining cells with a strong anionic dye Sirius red, which reacted with basic groups present in collagens via its sulfonic acid groups. It has been reported that type I and III collagens are well stained by Sirius red (19Tullberg-Reinert H. Jundt G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 112: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Four-day treatment with vitamin K2 exhibited significantly more intense staining by Sirius red compared with vehicle in MG63 cells under conditions favoring osteoblast differentiation (Fig. 5A). We also examined collagen accumulation in murine MC3T3-E1 cells, one of the cell lines with a close-to-normal osteoblast phenotype. Four-day treatment with vitamin K2 increased collagen accumulation by 15.0% in this cell line. Note that RIF (1 μm) also increased collagen accumulation by 13.6% in MG63 cells after 4-day treatment. Moreover, the vitamin K2-stimulated collagen accumulation in MG63 cells was not affected by warfarin treatment, suggesting that the γ-carboxylase-dependent vitamin K2 action may not be involved (Fig. 5B). To determine whether TSK plays a role in the vitamin K2-stimulated collagen accumulation, MG63 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged TSK were generated. Two TSK-overexpressing clones were isolated, as confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5C). MG63 clones overexpressing TSK showed significantly enhanced collagen accumulation in 7-day culture under differentiation conditions compared with vector-tran"
https://openalex.org/W2038599271,"PUMA is a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein that plays an essential role in DNA damage-induced apoptosis. PUMA interacts with anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and is dependent on Bax to induce apoptosis. In this study, we investigated how the interactions of PUMA with the antiapoptotic proteins coordinate with Bax to initiate apoptosis in HCT116 colon cancer cells. We found that Bcl-XL was most effective among several antiapoptotic proteins in suppressing PUMA-induced apoptosis and PUMA-dependent apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging agent adriamycin. Mutant Bcl-XL that cannot interact with Bax was unable to protect cells from PUMA-mediated apoptosis. Knockdown of Bcl-XL by RNA interference significantly enhanced PUMA-mediated apoptosis in HCT116 cells but not in PUMA-knockout cells. Furthermore, Bax was found to be dissociated preferentially from Bcl-XL in HCT116 cells but not in the PUMA-knockout cells, in response to PUMA induction and adriamycin treatment. PUMA inhibited the association of Bax and Bcl-XL in vitro by directly binding to Bcl-XL through its BH3 domain. Finally, we found that wild-type Bax, but not mutant Bax deficient in either multimerization or mitochondrial localization, was able to restore PUMA-induced apoptosis in the BAX-knockout cells. Together, these results indicate that PUMA initiates apoptosis in part by dissociating Bax and Bcl-XL, thereby promoting Bax multimerization and mitochondrial translocation.

Mutant Bcl-XL that cannot interact with Bax was unable to protect cells from PUMA-mediated apoptosis. Knockdown of Bcl-XL by RNA interference significantly enhanced PUMA-mediated apoptosis in HCT116 cells but not in PUMA-knockout cells. Furthermore, Bax was found to be dissociated preferentially from Bcl-XL in HCT116 cells but not in the PUMA-knockout cells, in response to PUMA induction and adriamycin treatment. PUMA inhibited the association of Bax and Bcl-XL in vitro by directly binding to Bcl-XL through its BH3 domain. Finally, we found that wild-type Bax, but not mutant Bax deficient in either multimerization or mitochondrial localization, was able to restore PUMA-induced apoptosis in the BAX-knockout cells. Together, these results indicate that PUMA initiates apoptosis in part by dissociating Bax and Bcl-XL, thereby promoting Bax multimerization and mitochondrial translocation. PUMA is a downstream target of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and a member of the BH3-only group of Bcl-2 family proteins (1Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol.

PUMA is normally expressed at a low level but is markedly induced after cells are exposed to DNA-damaging agents, such as chemotherapeutic drugs and ionizing radiation (1Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M.

Cell. 2001; 7: 683-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). The activation of PUMA by DNA damage is dependent on p53 and is mediated by the direct binding of p53 to the PUMA promoter region (1Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). PUMA can also be induced via p53-independent mechanisms by glucocorticoids and serum deprivation (3Han J. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Gu Z. Zambetti G.P. Lutz R.J. Zhu L. Chittenden T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11318-11323Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar).

For example, apoptosis induced by γ-irradiation, DNA-damaging drugs, and the oncogenes c-Myc and E1A is abrogated to a similar extent in PUMA-knockout mice as in the p53-knockout mice (6Jeffers J.R.

PUMA is also involved in apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress and human immunodeficiency virus proteins (8Reimertz C. Kogel D. Rami A. Chittenden T. Prehn J.H. J.

Furthermore, PUMA seems to play a role in tumor suppression, because down-regulation of PUMA promotes oncogenic transformation and accelerates lymphomagenesis induced by the Myc oncogene (10Hemann M.T.

In mammalian cells, Bcl-2 family proteins play a critical role in regulating apoptosis initiation through the mitochondria (11Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M.

Bcl-2 family members can be grouped into “multidomain” and “BH3-only” subgroups. The multidomain proteins, such as antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and proapoptotic Bax and Bak, contain three or four Bcl-2 homology (BH) 2The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; siRNA, small interference RNA; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; IP, immunoprecipitation; TM, transmembrane; SMAC, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase; Diablo, direct inhibitor of apoptosis protein-binding protein with low pI; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor. domains (11Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). The BH3-only proteins, including PUMA and at least eight additional proapoptotic proteins, display sequence homology with other members only within an α-helical BH3 domain, which is essential for apoptosis induction (17Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins function through multidomain Bcl-2 family members to induce apoptosis, either by antagonizing antiapoptotic proteins or by directly activating proapoptotic proteins (18Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 19Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members trigger a cascade of downstream events to initiate apoptosis, including collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, SMAC/Diablo, and AIF from the mitochondria into the cytosol, and activation of caspase cascade (12Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar, 14Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our previous studies in colon cancer cells demonstrated that PUMA is a mitochondrial protein, and its mitochondrial localization is indispensable for apoptosis induction (1Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 5Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). PUMA binds to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and induces mitochondrial membrane potential change and caspase activation (1Yu J. Zhang L.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). PUMA-induced apoptosis is completely abrogated in BAX-knockout (BAX-KO) HCT116 cells (5Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Expression of PUMA leads to translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria and formation of Bax multimers in the mitochondria (5Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that PUMA can couple the nuclear and cytoplasmic proapoptotic functions of p53 by displacing p53 from Bcl-XL, thereby allowing p53 to induce mitochondrial permeabilization (20Chipuk J.E. Bouchier-Hayes L. Kuwana T. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. Science. 2005; 309: 1732-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined how these events and their coordination initiate PUMA-induced apoptosis. To further understand the mechanisms of PUMA-induced apoptosis, we investigated how PUMA functions through Bax and other Bcl-2 family members to initiate apoptosis. We found Bcl-XL to be a critical antiapoptotic protein mediating PUMA-induced apoptosis in HCT 116 cells. PUMA dissociates Bax from Bcl-XL, thereby promoting Bax mitochondrial translocation and multimerization. Cell Culture and Transfection—All of the cell lines were maintained at 37 °C and with 5% CO2. HCT116 and derivative cell lines were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (Invitrogen). 911 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech). All of the cell culture media were supplemented with 10% defined fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). HCT116 and derivative cell lines were transfected with various constructs and small interference RNA (siRNA) by Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The siRNA duplex (Dharmacon) used for targeting Bcl-XL (Bcl-XL471) 5′-GGAGAUGCAGGUAUUGGUG-3′ was as described (21Zhu H. Guo W. Zhang L. Davis J.J. Teraishi F. Wu S. Cao X. Daniel J. Smythe W.R. Fang B. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 expression plasmid constructed in pCEP4 (Invitrogen), the Bcl-XL expression plasmid constructed in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen), and the Mcl-1 expression plasmid constructed using p3XFLAG-CMV-10 (Sigma) were previously described (1Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar, 22Nijhawan D. Fang M. Traer E. Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1475-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The Bcl-XL mutant (Bcl-XL mt8) that is deficient in binding to other Bcl-2 family proteins was also previously described (19Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). Analysis of PUMA-induced Apoptosis—The cells were plated in 12-well plates at ∼20% density and allowed to attach for 12 h. Adenoviruses expressing PUMA (Ad-PUMA) and a PUMA mutant with a deletion of the BH3 domain (Ad-ΔBH3) were used to infect cells (5Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Adriamycin (0.2μg/ml) was used to treat p21-KO and p21-KO/PUMA-KO cells. Floating and adhering cells were collected at various time points after treatment. For analysis of apoptosis by nuclear staining, the cells were resuspended and fixed in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes). Apoptosis was assessed through microscopic visualization of condensed chromatin and micronucleation as previously described (23Yu J. Tiwari S. Steiner P. Zhang L. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 694-699PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of apoptosis by annexin V staining, the cells were stained by annexin Alexa-594 (Molecular Probes) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, counterstained by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) for cell nuclei, and then analyzed by flow cytometry as described (24Kohli M. Yu J. Seaman C. Bardelli A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16897-16902Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Western Blotting—The antibodies used for Western blotting include antibodies against caspase 8 and caspase 9 (Cell Signaling), anti-caspase 3 antibody (Stressgen), antibodies against Bax (N-20), GFP, HA, and AIF (Santa Cruz), antibodies against cytochrome c, α-tubulin, Bcl-XL (BD Biosciences), anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), and anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (Cox IV) antibody (Molecular Probes). The anti-SMAC/Diablo antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Eileen White at Rutgers University (Piscataway, NJ). Western blotting analysis was performed as previously described (24Kohli M. Yu J. Seaman C. Bardelli A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Lengauer C. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16897-16902Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of EBC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences). The cells were disrupted by sonication and then spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min to collect the cell lystate. For immunoprecipitation (IP), 1–2 μg of IP antibodies were added to 50 μl cell lysates. The mixtures were mixed on a rocker at 4 °C overnight. The immunocomplexes were captured by the addition of protein G/A-agarose (Roche Applied Sciences) mixed at 1:5 ratio, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed four times by EBC buffer and then collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × g. After the final wash, the beads were mixed with 50 μlof2 × Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 15 min, and analyzed by Western blotting. In some experiments, a peptide (EQWAREIGAQLRRMADDLNA) containing the BH3 domain of PUMA and a control peptide (EQWAREIGAQERRMADDLNA) with a point mutation (Leu to Glu) in the BH3 domain were added to cell lysates before the addition of the antibodies. The peptides were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by the Peptide Synthesis Core Facility at University of Pittsburgh. Generation of BAX Mutants and Stable Cell Lines Expressing BAX Mutants—Bax expression construct pCEP4-HABAX was used to generate Bax mutant expression constructs (5Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To generate Bax deletion constructs BAX-D1 and BAX-D2, the corresponding BAX sequences were amplified using the pCEP4-HABAX as template. The PCR products were then cloned into the vector pCEP4-HAHA (pHAHA) containing double HA tags (5Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To generate point mutation constructs BAX-M1 and BAX-M2, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the pCEP4-HABAX plasmid with the QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) following the instructions of the manufacturer. To generate constructs expressing N-terminal GFP fused to wild-type and mutant Bax proteins, the corresponding sequences were amplified using the pCEP4 constructs as template. The PCR products were then cloned into pEGFPN1 vector (Clontech). Details of plasmid construction are available upon request. The inserts of all the constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing analysis. To establish stable cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant Bax, BAX-KO cells were transfected with the Bax expression constructs. After transfection, cells were plated out by limiting dilution and selected in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen) for 3 weeks. Individual clones were expanded and cell lysates were harvested and examined for Bax expression by Western blotting. Clones exhibiting stable expression of wild-type and mutant Bax were identified and used in the described study. Localization of Wild-type and Mutant Bax Proteins—911 cells were seeded on glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc) and transfected with various Bax expression constructs. Twenty-four h following transfection, the cells were incubated with 100 nm of MitoTracker Red (CmxRos; Molecular Probes) at 37 °C for 20 min to label the mitochondria. Cells were then permeabilized with cold acetone, and counterstained by DAPI (2 μg/ml). The mounted slides were subjected to microscopic analysis under a Nikon fluorescence microscope (TS800) equipped with a SPOT camera and imaging software. Analysis of Cytochrome c, SMAC/Diablo, and AIF Release—Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were isolated by the differential centrifugation method previously described (5Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and resuspended in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 and 1 mm EGTA) and subjected to 40 strokes of homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain cytosolic fraction (supernatant) and mitochondrial fraction (pellet). The mitochondrial fraction was resuspended in homogenization buffer following one wash. Both fractions were mixed with equal volumes of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer for Western blotting analysis. Bcl-XL Is Most Effective in Inhibiting PUMA-mediated Apoptosis—It has been suggested that the interactions between proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members play an important role in apoptosis initiation (11Cory S. Huang D.C. Adams J.M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8590-8607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 12Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that PUMA interacts with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL proteins through its BH3 domain (1Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 673-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). To study the role of the antiapoptotic proteins in PUMA-induced apoptosis, we transfected HCT116 cells with Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1, all of which are known to be abundantly expressed in colon cancer cells (25Zhang L. Zhou W. Velculescu V.E. Kern S.E. Hruban R.H. Hamilton S.R. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis indicated that Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 were expressed at a high level in the transfected cells (Fig. 1A). After transfection, the cells were infected with an adenovirus expressing PUMA (Ad-PUMA) and a control adenovirus expressing PUMA lacking the BH3 domain (Ad-ΔBH3). Viral titer and infection efficiency were controlled by GFP expressed from the adenoviruses. Apoptosis was analyzed 48 h after infection by counting fragmented nuclei. Transfection of Bcl-XL led to over 60% inhibition of apoptosis induced by Ad-PUMA (Fig. 1A). However, transfection of Bcl-2 had virtually no effect on PUMA-induced apoptosis, whereas transfection of Mcl-1 modestly inhibited apoptosis (Fig. 1A). No significant apoptosis was detected in the control cells infected by Ad-ΔBH3, with or without transfection of different plasmids. To determine whether Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Mcl-1 have similar effects on apoptosis mediated by endogenous PUMA, we analyzed adriamycin-induced apoptosis in p21-knockout (p21-KO) HCT116 cells. Adriamycin, a DNA-damaging agent that causes single- and double-stranded DNA breaks, can induce PUMA-dependent apoptosis in the p21-KO cells (5Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Similar to apoptosis induced by Ad-PUMA in HCT116 cells, transfection with Bcl-XL suppressed adriamycin-induced apoptosis by over 60% in the p21-KO cells, whereas transfection of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 had much less influence on adriamycin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that Bcl-XL is effective in inhibiting PUMA-mediated apoptosis and perhaps a major mediator of the proapoptotic function of PUMA. Knockdown of Bcl-XL Enhanced PUMA-mediated Apoptosis—To determine whether Bcl-XL plays a role in regulating the proapoptotic function of PUMA, we examined whether down-regulation of Bcl-XL enhances PUMA-mediated apoptosis. RNA interference was used to knock down Bcl-XL expression in HCT116 and the p21-KO cells. Transfection of the control GFP plasmid indicated that at least 80% of HCT116 cells can be transfected (Fig. 2A). It was found that Bcl-XL protein expression was significantly suppressed (60–90%) upon transfecting the cells with siRNA specific for Bcl-XL (Fig. 2, B and C). Knockdown of Bcl-XL markedly enhanced PUMA-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells, as well as adriamycin-induced apoptosis in the p21-KO cells (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, transfecting the cells with a control scrambled siRNA did not affect Bcl-XL expression and apoptosis induced by Ad-PUMA and adriamycin (Fig. 2, B and C). These results were confirmed by analysis of apoptosis using annexin V staining (data not shown). To test whether the effect of Bcl-XL on adriamycin-induced apoptosis is mediated by endogenous PUMA, we also knocked down Bcl-XL in HCT116 cells deficient in both p21 and PUMA (p21-KO/PUMA-KO), which were shown previously to be insensitive to adriamycin-induced apoptosis (5Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). We found that Bcl-XL knockdown did not increase the sensitivity to adriamycin-induced apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that Bcl-XL plays an important role in regulating apoptosis mediated by PUMA. Bax Is Dissociated from Bcl-XL during PUMA-mediated Apoptosis—Previous studies have shown that there are two groups of BH3-only proteins. The BH3 domains of Bid and Bim can directly activate Bax and Bak, whereas those of Bad and Bik activate Bax and Bak by displacing them from antiapoptotic activities (26Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Because Bax is required for PUMA-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells (5Yu J. Wang Z. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Zhang L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1931-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), and Bax is known to interact with Bcl-XL, we hypothesized that PUMA induces apoptosis by modulating the interaction between Bax and Bcl-XL. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of a Bcl-XL mutant (Bcl-XL mt8) deficient in binding to Bax on PUMA-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 1C) (19Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). The mutant Bcl-XL did not suppress apoptosis induced by Ad-PUMA and adriamycin (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that the inhibition of Bcl-XL on PUMA-mediated apoptosis requires its interaction with Bax or other Bcl-2 family proteins. We then analyzed whether PUMA induction affects the interactions between Bax and Bcl-XL, between Bax and Bcl-2, and between Bax and Mcl-1. Infection of HCT116 cells by Ad-PUMA caused a significant decrease in the amount of Bcl-XL associated with Bax (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the level of Bcl-XL associated with Bax was much lower in the p21-KO cells after adriamycin treatment (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, the level of Bcl-XL bound to Bax was not affected by adriamycin treatment in the p21-KO/PUMA-KO cells, indicating that the dissociation of Bax and Bcl-XL was mediated by PUMA (Fig. 3C). No significant association between endogenous Bax and Bcl-2 or between Bax and Mcl-1 was detected in these cells before and after the treatment (Fig. 3). These results indicate that dynamic regulation of Bax and Bcl-XL interaction plays an important role in initiating PUMA-mediated apoptosis. PUMA Dissociates Bax and Bcl-XL through Competitive Binding to Bcl-XL—To understand how PUMA causes the dissociation of Bax and Bcl-XL, we studied the direct interactions among PUMA, Bax, and Bcl-XL. HA-tagged PUMA and GFP-tagged Bax expression constructs were transfected into the BAX-KO cells to examine whether PUMA binds to Bax. Reciprocal IP with either HA (for PUMA) or GFP (for Bax) did not identify any interaction between PUMA and Bax (Fig. 4A). In contrast, both PUMA and Bax were found to be strongly associated with Bcl-XL under identical conditions (Fig. 4A). Because both Bax and PUMA interact with Bcl-XL through their BH3 domains, and Bcl-XL interacts with Bax and BH3-only proteins through the same amino acid residues (19Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar, 27Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), we speculated that PUMA can directly cause the dissociation of Bax and Bcl-XL through competitive binding to Bcl-XL. To test this possibility, protein extracts isolated from the BAX-KO cells cotransfected with Bax and Bcl-XL were incubated with those from cells transfected with PUMA alone. IP was performed to analyze the influence of PUMA on the interaction between Bax and Bcl-XL. PUMA present at a similar level as Bax markedly reduced the amount of Bax bound to Bcl-XL, with over 90% of Bax originally bound to Bcl-XL dissociated after 4 h of incubation (Fig. 4B), indicating that PUMA competed with Bax for binding to Bcl-XL. Such an effect of PUMA was dependent on the BH3 domain, because BH3 domain-deleted PUMA (ΔBH3) was unable to dissociate Bax and Bcl-XL (Fig. 4B). To directly examine whether the BH3 domain of PUMA has this activity, we analyzed the effects of a peptide containing the BH3 domain of PUMA, and a control peptide containing a point mutation (Leu to Glu) in the lysine residue critical for proapoptotic activity (17Huang D.C.

https://openalex.org/W1964695865,"Dynamic interactions between the cytoskeleton and integrins control cell adhesion, but regulatory mechanisms remain largely undefined. Here, we tested the extent to which the autoinhibitory head-tail interaction (HTI) in vinculin regulates formation and lifetime of the talin-vinculin complex, a proposed mediator of integrin–cytoskeleton bonds. In an ectopic recruitment assay, mutational reduction of HTI drove assembly of talin-vinculin complexes, whereas ectopic complexes did not form between talin and wild-type vinculin. Moreover, reduction of HTI altered the dynamic assembly of vinculin and talin in focal adhesions. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, we show that the focal adhesion residency time of vinculin was enhanced up to 3-fold by HTI mutations. The slow dynamics of vinculin correlated with exposure of its cryptic talin-binding site, and a talin-binding site mutation rescued the dynamics of activated vinculin. Significantly, HTI-deficient vinculin inhibited the focal adhesion dynamics of talin, but not paxillin or α-actinin. These data show that talin conformation in cells permits vinculin binding, whereas the autoinhibited conformation of vinculin constitutes the barrier to complex formation. Down-regulation of HTI in vinculin to Kd ∼ 10–7 is sufficient to induce talin binding, and HTI is essential to the dynamics of vinculin and talin at focal adhesions. We therefore conclude that vinculin conformation, as modulated by the strength of HTI, directly regulates the formation and lifetime of talin-vinculin complexes in cells."

Recent studies have shown that laminin γ3, restricted to elongating spermatids, is a putative binding partner of α 6β 1-integrin localized in Sertoli cells at the apical ES. However, the identity of the α and β chains, which constitute a functional laminin ligand with the γ3 chain at the apical ES, is not known.

Am. J. Anat. 1977; 148: 313-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Once in the adluminal compartment, spermatocytes differentiate into round spermatids, and the elongating/elongate spermatids orientate themselves with heads and tails pointing toward the basal lamina and the tubule lumen, respectively. The primary anchoring device that facilitates this process of orientation, while maintaining adhesion at the Sertoli cell/spermatid interface, is the apical ectoplasmic specialization (ES), a cell/cell actin-based adherens junction (AJ) type (2Russell L.D.

These include the cadherin·catenin, nectin·afadin, and integrin·laminin protein complexes (5Koch M. Olson P.F. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Champliaud M.F. J.

Reprod. 2003; 68: 489-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which are the primary adhesion protein complexes at the Sertoli cell/developing spermatid interface. Interestingly, in virtually all other epithelia, the integrin·laminin complex is usually restricted to the basement membrane at the cell/matrix interface (11Aumailley M. Smyth N. J. Anat. 1998; 198: 1-21Crossref Google Scholar, 12Sasaki T. Fassler R. Hohenester E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Yet studies have shown that integrin is a crucial adhesion molecule at the apical ES (7Palombi F. Salanova M. Taron G. Garini D. Stefanini M. Biol.

Reprod. 1998; 58: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and together with laminin is likely the most important functional protein complex at the Sertoli cell/spermatid interface at the apical ES, suggesting that apical ES is a hybrid cell/cell and cell/matrix anchoring junction type (4Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. Vogl A.W. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 64: 396-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Siu M.K.Y. Cheng C.Y. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 978-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Laminins are glycoproteins and heterotrimers composed of α, β, and γ chains. To date, there are five known α-subunits, four β-subunits, and three γ-subunits that can give rise to at least 16 different functional laminin ligands that bind to integrins restricted to the cell/matrix anchoring junctions, also known as focal contacts or focal adhesion complexes (15Hallmann R.

Laminins are crucial scaffolding proteins that provide structural stability to epithelia/endothelia in the basement membrane (12Sasaki T. Fassler R. Hohenester E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). More important, laminins and integrins at focal contacts provide adhesion between epithelial cells and basal lamina. This laminin·integrin protein complex also serves as an efficient structure to facilitate cell migration during normal and in pathological conditions, such as tumor invasion. The roles of laminins have been expanded from cell/matrix site to cell/cell interface following the identification of a non-basement membrane-associated laminin γ3 chain in mouse testes (5Koch M. Olson P.F. Albus A. Jin W. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. Burgeson R.E. Champliaud M.F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 605-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar); laminin-423 and laminin-523 (previously known as laminins 14 and 15, respectively) were also found to reside outside the retinal basement membrane (17Libby R.T. Champliaud M.F. Claudepierre T. Xu Y. Gibbons E.P. Koch M. Burgeson R.E. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6517-6528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although their functions at the apical cell surface remain to be defined, it has been speculated that laminins expressed at the apical retinal epithelium may play a role in photoreceptor morphogenesis (17Libby R.T. Champliaud M.F. Claudepierre T. Xu Y. Gibbons E.P. Koch M. Burgeson R.E. Hunter D.D. Brunken W.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6517-6528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In adult rat testes, laminin γ3 chain has recently been shown to be a putative binding partner of α6β1-integrin at the Sertoli cell/spermatid interface (18Siu M.K.Y. Cheng C.Y. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 945-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); however, the α and β chains that constitute a functional laminin remain to be identified. In this report, we sought to identify the laminin α and β chains that form a functional ligand together with γ3 for α6β1-integrin at the apical ES. Using specific blocking antibodies, we also sought to examine the changes in the status of spermatogenesis, the integrity of the Sertoli-germ cell adhesion, and the BTB when functional laminin chains at the apical ES were perturbed. This is an initial attempt to study cross-talk between apical ES and BTB. Animals—The use of rats and rabbits was approved by The Rockefeller University Laboratory Animal Use and Care Committee with protocol numbers 00111, 03017, 03040, and 06018. RNA Isolation, RT-PCR, Isolation of Sertoli and Germ Cells, and Primary Cultures and Co-cultures of Testicular Cells—Total RNA from rat testes, testicular cells, Sertoli cell cultures, and Sertoli-germ cell cocultures were extracted using RNA STAT-60™ (Tel-Test “B” Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Sertoli and germ cells were isolated from testes of 20- and 90-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively, as described previously (19Mruk D.D. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol.

The purity of Sertoli and germ cells used in studies reported herein was monitored and characterized by primers specific to markers of Sertoli cells (e.g. testin), spermatogonia (e.g. c-Kit receptor), Leydig cells (e.g. 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), and myoid cells (e.g. fibronectin), as well as electron microscopy as detailed elsewhere (10Lee N.P.Y.

These analyses have shown that the cell preparations (e.g. Sertoli and germ cells) used in our studies had negligible contamination from other cell types. For co-culture, Sertoli cells were plated on Matrigel-coated dishes (Matrigel diluted 1:7 with F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and cultured alone in serum-free F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with epidermal growth factor, insulin, transferrin, and bacitracin as described (19Mruk D.D.

On day 6, total germ cells isolated from adult rat testes were plated onto the Sertoli cell epithelium using a Sertoli:germ cell ratio of 1:1 or 1:2 to initiate Sertoli-germ cell adherens junction assembly, and co-cultures were terminated at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h thereafter. Cultures (in triplicates) were used for each time point, and each experiment was repeated at least three times using different batches of Sertoli and germ cells. The formation of functional tight junctions between Sertoli cells and adherens junctions (e.g. apical ectoplasmic specialization) at the Sertoli/germ cell interface in these cocultures was assessed by electron microscopy as described previously (23Siu M.K.Y. Wong C.H. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25029-25047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Production of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant proteins of laminin α3, β3, and γ3 chains were expressed and produced using Escherichia coli BL21 Star™ (DE3) cells with the Champion™ pET Directional TOPO® expression kit (Invitrogen). First, cDNAs corresponding to domain G of laminin α3 and domain I of laminins β3 and γ3 were amplified by PCR with Accprime™ Pfx SuperMix (catalog no. 12344-040, Invitrogen) using total cDNAs from 90-day-old germ cells that served as the template (note that total RNA isolated from these germ cells were reverse-transcribed to cDNAs with oligo(dT)-15-mer and reverse transcriptase) and specific primers shown in supplemental Table S2 and then subcloned into pET101/d-TOPO® expression vectors. The inserted cDNA was in-frame with the expression vector and was confirmed by direct nucleotide sequencing. The expression vectors were transformed into E. coli BL21 Star™ (DE3) cells by the heat shock method at 42 °C. Protein expression in bacterial culture was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the A600 nm level reached between 0.5 and 0.8. Bacteria were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 6 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g for 10 min). To extract lysates, bacterial cell pellets were suspended in a lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, 400 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v), 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.8), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and thawed at 42 °C (repeated three times) followed by sonication (using a Cole-Parmer model CP 130PB-1 ultrasonic processor, Chicago) and centrifugation. The recombinant proteins were produced with V5 and His6 epitope tags at the C terminus, and the authenticity was verified by a specific mouse anti-V5 epitope antibody (catalog no. R960-25, Invitrogen). Recombinant proteins were purified using a nickel column (Amersham Biosciences). The purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained gels. The identity of the corresponding laminin recombinant proteins was subsequently confirmed using proteins sliced out of the Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels by mass spectrometry, performed at The Rockefeller University Proteomics Resource Center. In some experiments (e.g. Fig. 2A), proteins embedded in Coomassie Blue-stained gel slices were micropurified using electroelution by placing ∼10-20 gel slices (containing 200 - 400 μg of laminin chain protein) in a small dialysis bag (Spectrapor tubing with Mr cut-off at 3500; Spectrum Laboratories Inc., Rancho Dominguez, CA) and suspended in a final volume of ∼500 - 800 μl of gel running buffer. The dialysis bag was then placed in a Hoefer horizontal gel unit, and electroelution was performed at 80 V for 4 - 8 h at room temperature using SDS-polyacrylamide gel running buffer without SDS as the electroelution buffer. Preparation of Antiserum and Purification of IgG—Anti-laminins α3, β3, and γ3 were prepared in female New Zealand White rabbits with three immunizations using affinity column and gel-purified recombinant proteins emulsified with Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvants essentially as earlier described (26Cheng C.Y. Bardin C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12768-12779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, to prepare highly purified recombinant proteins for immunization, recombinant laminin α3, β3, and γ3 proteins isolated from the nickel columns were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 15% T SDS-polyacrylamide gels, stained with Coomassie Blue, and the bands corresponded to the different laminin chains were sliced out. To remove acetic acid and methanol that were used in the Coomassie Blue staining and de-staining steps, gel slices (∼10-15 μg protein/slice; about 15 gel slices were used for each immunization per rabbit) were immediately suspended in 5 ml of PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 at 22 °C) and placed in a rotator at 30 rpm. Gel slices containing ∼200 μg of recombinant protein were washed with PBS five times and homogenized in ∼400 μl of PBS using a glass homogenizer. Homogenized gel slices were then emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant with a sonicator and administered subcutaneously to the back of the rabbit at ∼4 sites (200 μl/site). Prior to the first immunization, about 30 ml of blood was collected from the ear vein of each rabbit to obtain preimmune serum, which was used for corresponding control experiments described herein. Two booster injections were administered 6 and 8 weeks later using similar amounts of gel-purified recombinant proteins but emulsified with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Rabbits were bled, 10 days after the final booster injection, from the marginal vein in the ear, and at least four more bleedings were collected weekly thereafter. Blood allowed to clot overnight at 4 °C was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 15 min to obtain serum. Anti-laminin α3, β3, and γ3 IgG and the IgG from corresponding preimmune sera were isolated from (∼5 ml) sera by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE (Bio-Rad) affinity chromatography as described (27Cheng C.Y. Mathur P.P. Grima J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4079-4088Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The purity of the IgG was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Characterization of Anti-laminin α3, β3, and γ3 Antibodies—To confirm that the antibodies raised against laminin α3 chain in rabbits did not cross-react with β3 and/or γ3 and vice versa, such that the results obtained from co-immunoprecipitation experiments were not artifacts of antibody cross-reactivity among these three laminin chains (namely α3, β3, and γ3), the antigens and these antibodies were characterized as follows. First, the identities of the nickel column-purified recombinant laminin α3, β3, and γ3 proteins were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Protein sequence analyses and their alignments were examined by using the EMBOSS software (European Bioinformatics Institute). The purity of the recombinant proteins used for immunization was also confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining prior to their use for immunization. Second, the three antibodies were characterized by immunoblotting as follows. In short, ∼50 μg of crude bacterial protein lysates from bacterial cultures transformed with the corresponding plasmids, containing either α3, β3, or γ3 construct, were subjected to immunoblotting. The protein blots were immunostained sequentially with mouse anti-V5 epitope antibody followed by anti-laminin α3, β3, and γ3 antibodies to assess cross-reactivity. Electron Microscopy (EM) and Immunogold EM—Electron microscopy and immunogold EM studies were performed at The Rockefeller University Bio-imaging Resource Center essentially as described previously (28Santos M.J. Imanaka T. Shio H. Lazarow P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10502-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sam-Yellowe T.Y. Shio H. Perkins M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) using adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (∼250 g body weight). In short, rat testes obtained from controls (normal rats and testes treated with preimmune IgG) and rats treated with either antilaminin α3 or γ3 IgG at specified time points were cut into small pieces (∼1-2 mm) and fixed immediately in ice-cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 7.4, overnight. Thereafter, samples were embedded in 3% agar to keep the tubules together. After solidification, excessive agar was removed, and the specimens were post-fixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 7.4, on ice for 1-2 h. The tubules in agar blocks were treated en bloc with aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h at room temperature. Specimens were then dehydrated with ascending graded alcohol, propylene oxide and then embedded in Epon 812. The specimens were oriented such that cross-sections could be obtained in multiple tubules. Semi-thin sections (0.5 μm) were cut with a glass knife and stained with 0.25% toluidine blue in 1% borate, allowing visualization of the tubules at light microscopic level for their orientation. Tissue block was retrimmed, and ultra-thin sections were obtained with a DuPont diamond knife. Ultra-thin sections were collected on copper grids and stained with both uranyl acetate and lead citrate before being examined in a JEOL 100 CX electron microscope operated at 80 kV. For immunogold EM, normal testes were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 for 3 h. After dehydration with ascending graded alcohol, specimens were embedded in Epon 812. They were incubated with the antiserum (or anti-laminin α or γ IgG, or preimmune serum for control experiments) at room temperature overnight followed by incubation with 10-nm gold-labeled secondary antibody. Conjugation of Anti-laminin α3 and γ3 IgG with Alexa Fluor 488 Dye and Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Conjugation of anti-laminin α3 and γ3 IgG with Alexa Fluor 488 dye was performed using the Alexa Fluor® 488 Microscale protein labeling kit from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). In short, about 11.3 nmol/μl reactive Alexa Fluor 488 dye was used to label ∼60 μg of either anti-laminin α3 or γ3 IgG suspended in PBS. Excessive dye was removed using a spin column. To demonstrate the co-localization of different laminin chains in the seminiferous epithelium of rat testes, immunofluorescent microscopy was performed as described (30Wong C.H. Xia W. Lee N.P.Y. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1192-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In brief, frozen sections of testes were first incubated with a 1:300 dilution of anti-laminin α3 containing 1% normal goat serum at 35 °C overnight. The sections were then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 dye-conjugated anti-laminin γ3 IgG at 4 °C for 7 h. Secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), diluted in PBS to 1:50, were incubated with the sections for ∼30 min. Negative controls were preformed using corresponding normal rabbit IgG, and these sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 dye-conjugated anti-laminin γ3 IgG followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3. Sections were then washed and mounted with Vectashield Hardset with 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (a nucleus stain, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Fluorescent micrographs were obtained using a BX40 microscope (Olympus Corp., Melville, NY) equipped with Olympus UPlanF1 fluorescent optics and an Olympus DP70 12.5 MPa digital camera. Immunohistochemistry and Immunocytochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (30Wong C.H. Xia W. Lee N.P.Y. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1192-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Control experiments were preformed using corresponding preimmune rabbit serum or IgG instead of the primary antibodies. The sources of antibodies used for all the studies described herein are listed in supplemental Table S3. Immunocytochemistry was performed to study the co-localization of laminin α3/γ3 and laminin γ3\m=.β1-integrin in vitro. Sertoli cells were isolated and cultured for 5 days on a Lab-Tek® Chamber Slide™ system (Nalgene Nunc International) coated with Matrigel™ (Collaborative Biochemical Products, Bedford, MA) at a cell density of 5 × 104 cells/well (∼1.8 cm2). Thereafter, total germ cells were added to Sertoli cells at a Sertoli:germ cell ratio of 1:2 and cultured for an additional 2 days to allow adherens junction formation. Cells were fixed in ice-cold absolute methanol, blocked with 10% goat serum, and incubated with either an anti-laminin γ3 (1:300 in PBS containing 1% normal goat serum) or an anti-laminin α3 (1:300 dilution), mouse anti-N-cadherin, mouse anti-β1-integrin, or mouse anti-phospho-Src-Tyr426 antibody (working dilution of these antibodies are listed in supplemental Table S3) in 1% normal goat serum. Secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or Cy3 (obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in a 1:50 dilution of 10% normal goat serum were used. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and Immunoblotting—To study the binding partners of laminin γ3 as well as other interacting proteins in rat testes, co-IP was performed using lysates of either seminiferous tubules or germ cells as described previously (31Yan H.H.N. Cheng C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11722-11727Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Seminiferous tubules used for studies reported herein were isolated from adult rat testes and were shown to be contaminated with negligible Leydig cells as reported previously (31Yan H.H.N. Cheng C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11722-11727Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Seminiferous tubule and germ cell lysates were prepared in an IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovandate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4) as described (32Lee N.P.Y. Cheng C.Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 202: 344-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For co-IP using different laminin antibodies, lysates were preincubated at 65 °C for 4 min to unfold proteins, cooled to room temperature for 5 min before adding the corresponding precipitating anti-laminin antibodies with incubation at room temperature overnight in a Labnet Mini Labroller (Labnet International, Inc., Woodbridge, NJ) at 24 rpm. After co-IP, immunocomplexes were denatured in SDS-sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting. Negative controls included IgG isolated from either normal rabbit or normal mouse serum by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE anion-exchange chromatography. Each co-IP experiment was repeated at least three times using different sets of samples, and similar results were obtained from each experiment. Lysates of testes, seminiferous tubules, Sertoli cells, and germ cells used for immunoblotting were prepared in the same lysis buffer as described above. About 50 μg of proteins from each sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE using 7.5, 10, or 12% T SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, depending on the apparent Mr of the target proteins to be investigated. Immunoblottings were performed as described (30Wong C.H. Xia W. Lee N.P.Y. Mruk D.D. Lee W.M. Cheng C.Y. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1192-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1965803013,"mRNA interferases are sequence-specific endoribonucleases encoded by the toxin-antitoxin systems in the bacterial genomes. MazF from Escherichia coli has been shown to be an mRNA interferase that specifically cleaves at ACA sequences in single-stranded RNAs. It has been shown that MazF induction in E. coli effectively inhibits protein synthesis leading to cell growth arrest in the quasidormant state. Here we have demonstrated that Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains at least seven genes encoding MazF homologues (MazF-mt1 to -mt7), four of which (MazF-mt1, -mt3, -mt4, and -mt6) caused cell growth arrest when induced in E. coli. MazF-mt1 and MazF-mt6 were purified and characterized for their mRNA interferase specificities. We showed that MazF-mt1 preferentially cleaves the era mRNA between U and A in UAC triplet sequences, whereas MazF-mt6 preferentially cleaves U-rich regions in the era mRNA both in vivo and in vitro. These results indicate that M. tuberculosis contains sequence-specific mRNA interferases, which may play a role in the persistent dormancy of this devastating pathogen in human tissues. mRNA interferases are sequence-specific endoribonucleases encoded by the toxin-antitoxin systems in the bacterial genomes.

Most bacteria contain “suicidal” or “toxic” genes whose expression leads to growth arrest and eventual death upon exposure to stress. These toxin genes are usually coexpressed with their cognate antitoxin genes present in the same operon (1Engelberg-Kulka H. Hazan R. Amitai S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4327-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 2Gerdes K. Christensen S.K. Lobner-Olesen A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli chromosome contains six such operons called toxin-antitoxin (TA) 2The abbreviations used are: TA, toxin-antitoxin; ORF, open reading frame. 2The abbreviations used are: TA, toxin-antitoxin; ORF, open reading frame. systems. Of these, the MazE (antitoxin)/MazF (toxin) system is one of the most extensively characterized TA systems, and MazF has been shown to be a sequence-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves at ACA sequences in mRNAs (3Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 4Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, MazF is an mRNA interferase, and its induction causes the effective inhibition of protein synthesis leading to cell growth arrest. However, MazF-induced cells fully retain cellular metabolic activities, including ATP production and amino acid and nucleotide synthesis, as well as RNA and protein synthesis. Therefore, MazF-induced cells are capable of synthesizing a protein, if the gene encoding this protein is devoid of ACA sequences (4Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This metabolically active dormant state caused by mRNA interferase induction is called “quasidormancy” (4Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and has important implications in the physiology of various pathogenic bacteria, including persistent multidrug resistance.Notably, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, one of the most devastating human pathogens, contains nearly forty TA systems on its genome, among which nine have been shown to be homologous to E. coli MazF (5Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the TA modules play important roles in bacterial survival and formation of stable persisters in adverse conditions. These phenomena are essential for the persistence of M. tuberculosis. Persisters are the few rare pre-existing bacterial cells in a culture at any growth phase that are not growing and are intrinsically resistant to antibiotics by virtue of their subdued metabolism (6Keren I. Kaldalu N. Spoering A. Wang Y. Lewis K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 230: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 7Spoering A.L. Lewis K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6746-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar).In the present paper, we have characterized two of the MazF homologues from this pathogen, which showed high toxicity in E. coli when induced. We have demonstrated that these are indeed mRNA interferases that cleave specific RNA sequences. In view of the quasidormancy caused by MazF induction in E. coli, our results suggest that multiple mRNA interferases in M. tuberculosis may play a role in the multidimensional dormancy of this pathogen in human tissues.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Plasmids—E. coli BL21(DE3), BW25113 (ΔaraBAD) were used. Plasmids pET-28a-MazF-mt1 and MazF-mt6 were constructed using pET-28a (Novagen) to express His6MazF-mt1 and His6MazF-mt6. The plasmids pBAD-MazF-mt1 to pBAD-MazF-mt7 were constructed from pBAD vector, in which the protein expression can be tightly regulated by the addition of arabinose (0.2%).Purification of His6-tagged MazF-mt1 and MazF-mt6 Proteins Expressed in E. coli—His6MazF-mt1 and His6MazF-mt6 proteins tagged at the N-terminal end were purified from strain BL21(DE3) carrying pET-28a-MazF-mt1 and MazF-mt6, respectively, using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The proteins were stored in 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol buffer, pH 8.0, at -20 °C.Expression and Purification of MazF-mt1 Using Mycobacterium smegmatis MC2155 as a Host—The wild-type MazF-mt1 gene was PCR-amplified and cloned into an E. coli-M. smegmatis shuttle vector downstream of an acetamidase gene promoter (cloned from M. smegmatis genomic DNA) and upstream of a hexahistidine tag. This vector, carrying a hygromycin resistance gene, was constructed in our laboratory. M. smegmatis-competent cells carrying the construct were used to inoculate 2 ml of 7H9 medium, and this starter culture was incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 2 days and then used to inoculate larger volumes of 7H9 medium supplemented with Middlebrook oleic acid-albumindextrose-catalase enrichment and 2% acetamide (Sigma). The culture was grown for three days and cells were then harvested and resuspended in equilibration buffer (25 mm imidazole, 400 mm NaCl, and 50 mm NaPi, pH 8.0). The cells were then lysed with a French press. Cell debris was removed by one round of centrifugation at 25,000 rpm and at 4 °C. The lysate was added to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h, and the resin was then transferred to a column and washed with 50 ml of 50 mm NaPi, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. The His-tagged proteins were eluted with 50 mm NaPi, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole. Protein fractions were checked at A280 and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The highly purified fractions were collected and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES buffer containing 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 mm NaCl. The protein aliquots were stored at -80 °C.Primer Extension Analysis in Vivo and in Vitro—For primer extension analysis of mRNA cleavage sites in vivo, pIN-Era plasmid (8Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hara H. Kato I. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3143-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) was transformed into E. coli BW25113 cells containing pBAD-MazF-mt1 or MazF-mt6 plasmids. The era mRNA transcription was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After a 30-min induction, the toxin protein was induced by the addition of arabinose (a final concentration of 0.2%). Total RNA was isolated at time intervals as indicated in Figs. 3 and 4. Primer extension was carried out using different primers as described previously (3Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). For in vitro primer extension analysis, the full-length era mRNAs were synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase from the DNA fragment containing a T7 promoter sequence and the era open reading frame (ORF) using the RiboMAX™ T7 large scale RNA production system (Promega). The era DNA fragments were amplified using the forward primer (5′-CCCGCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ T7 promoter) and the reverse primers starting from the 3′-end of the era ORF. RNA substrates were partially digested with purified toxin protein at 37 °C for 15 min. The digestion reaction mixture (10 μl) consisted of 1 μg of RNA substrate, 0.2 μg of E. coli His6MazF-mt1 or 1 μg of M. smegmatis His6MazF-mt1 or E. coli His6MazF-mt6 and 0.5 μl of RNase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). Primer extension was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h in 20 μl of the reaction mixture as described previously (8Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hara H. Kato I. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3143-3150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by adding 12 μl of sequence loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol FF (C25H27N2NaO7S2)). The samples were incubated at 90 °C for 5 min prior to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide and 36% urea gel. The primers E1 (5′-CAGTTCAGCGCCGAGGAAACGCAT-3′), E2 (5′-GATCCCCACAATGCGGTGACGAGT-3′), and E4 (5′-GCGTTCGTCGTCGGCCCAACCGGA-3′) were used for primer extension analysis of the era mRNA. The primers were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase.FIGURE 4In vivo and in vitro cleavage of the era mRNA after induction of MazF-mt6. A and B, in vivo and in vitro cleavage of the era mRNA after induction of MazF-mt6 by adding 0.2% arabinose. For in vivo primer extension, total RNA was extracted at each time point after MazF-mt6 induction, and primer extension was carried out using primer E1 (A)orE2(B). For in vitro primer extension, the era mRNA was incubated with (lane 9) or without (lane 10) the purified His6MazF-mt6, and primer extension was carried out using primer E1 (A)orE2 (B). Cleavage sites are shown by arrows on the RNA sequence as determined using the DNA ladder.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cleavage of Synthetic RNA by MazF-mt1—Oligoribonucleotides (11 bases in length; see Fig. 3) were commercially synthesized and 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Endoribonuclease activity was assayed in 10 μl of the reaction mixture containing 0.5 μl (20 units) of ribonuclease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 0.2 μg of E. coli MazF-mt1 or 1 μg of M. smegmatis MazF-mt1 and 32P-labeled oligonucleotides in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of the loading buffer as described above. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to 20% sequence gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography.RESULTSBlast Search for MazF Homologues in M. tuberculosis—A blast search of all known ORFs in the M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) genome with E. coli MazF identified the gene Rv2801c that encodes a 118-residue protein that has 32.5% identity and 44% homology to E. coli MazF (Fig. 1A). Using this protein MazF-mt1 for further blast search, six more MazF homologues with >20% identity to MazF-mt1 (mt2 to mt7) were found (Fig. 1B). Notably, MazF-mt1, -mt2, and -mt3 have the putative 11-residue S1-S2 loop similar to E. coli MazF (9Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), whereas the others have much shorter S1-S2 loops (Fig. 1, A and B). The putative helix H1 is longer by five residues in MazF-mt1 and -mt2 and by three residues in -mt3, compared with that of E. coli MazF, whereas it is shorter by one residue in MazF-mt4, -mt5, -mt6, and -mt7 as compared with that of E. coli MazF (Fig. 1, A and B). MazF-mt2 lacks the C-terminal region encompassing β-strand S7 and helix H3. This seems to be due to a 28-bp deletion after the codon for Thr-88, because the 19-residue sequence highly homologous to helix H3 of MazF-mt1 is found immediately downstream of Thr-88 in a different reading frame (68% identity) (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, all MazF homologues appear to be co-translated with a short upstream ORF, most of which overlaps with the MazF ORFs (Fig. 1C). None of the upstream ORFs, however, show homology to E. coli MazE, antitoxin of MazF. As observed with MazE and MazF, most of the pairs consist of acidic and basic proteins, except for the pair of MazF-mt2 and its upstream ORF, both of which are basic proteins (Fig. 1C). It remains to be elucidated whether these upstream ORFs function as antitoxins for their cognate downstream ORFs.FIGURE 1Sequence alignments of MazF homologues from M. tuberculosis with E. coli MazF. A, alignment of MazF-mt1 (Rv2801c) with E. coli MazF. β-strand (S) and helical (H) region are assigned according to Kamada et al. (9Kamada K. Hanaoka F. Burley S.K. Mol.

B, alignments of MazF-mt2-mt7 to MazF-mt1. The consensus sequence is shown at the bottom. In MazF-mt2, the 19-residue sequence in blue is immediately downstream of the codon for Thr-88 with a -1 frameshift. MazF-mt2-mt7 correspond to Rv0456A, Rv1991c, Rv0659c, Rv1942c, Rv1102c, and Rv1495, respectively. C, upstream ORFs for MazF-mt1-mt7. These overlap with downstream MazF ORFs by 14, 14, 7, 14, 4, 29, and 4 bases for MazF-mt1-mt7, respectively. Total residue numbers and pI values are shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Four of the Seven MazF Homologues in M. tuberculosis Show Toxicity to E. coli—All ORFs were tested for their toxicity in E. coli using the pBAD expression plasmid. In the presence of 0.2% arabinose, cells expressing MazF-mt1, -mt3, -mt4, and -mt6 could not grow, whereas cells expressing MazF-mt2, -mt5, and -mt7 proteins were able to grow on an agar plate (Fig. 2A). Inhibitory effects of MazF-mt1, -mt3, -mt4, and -mt6 were also observed in M9-CAA liquid medium in the presence of 0.2% arabinose (Fig. 2B). In the case of cells expressing MazF-mt4 protein, severe growth inhibition was seen only after one generation of cell growth.FIGURE 2Toxicity of M. tuberculosis MazF homologues. A, E. coli BW25113 transformed with pBAD harboring ORFs for MazF-mt1-mt7 were streaked on M9 (glycerol, CAA) plates with (left) and without (right) 0.2% arabinose. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. B, growth curves of E. coli BW25113 harboring pBAD(MazF-mt1), (MazF-mt3), (MazF-mt4), and (MazF-mt6) plasmids in M9 (glycerol, CAA) liquid medium at 37 °C in the presence (blue) and the absence (red) of 0.2% arabinose. Cells harboring pBAD(MazF-mt4) plasmid were diluted 10 times after 150 min. Cell growth was measured by A (absorbance) at 600 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The MazF-mt1 Has Endoribonuclease Activity—We examined whether these MazF homologues have sequence-specific mRNA interferase activity, both in vivo and in vitro. When MazF-mt1 was induced by the addition of 0.2% arabinose, a specific cleavage of the era mRNA between U and A was detected in vivo by primer extension in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The identical cleavage site was detected with use of the era mRNA synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase and purified MazF-mt1 tagged with His6 at the N-terminal end (Fig. 3B, lane 2). In addition to the same site reported for the in vivo cleavage site (CU ↓ ACC), a weak cleavage site (UU ↓ ACA) was also detected. Using five primers covering almost the entire era mRNA, CU ↓ ACC and UU ↓ ACA were the only major cleavage sites detected, even when era mRNA contained six other UAC sequences (UUACU, AUACU, CUACG, AUACA, GUACU, and UUACG). Importantly, identical sites were cleaved by His6MazF-mt1, which was expressed and purified from M. smegmatis (Fig. 3B, lane 3), indicating that the observed cleavage is due to MazF-mt1. We further confirmed that the cleavage activity was not due to contaminating enzymes, because a purified His6MazF-mt1 (E19A) mutant protein showed a substantially reduced cleavage activity (not shown). This mutation in E. coli MazF has recently been shown to dramatically reduce the MazF mRNA interferase activity (10Li G.Y. Zhang Y. Chan M.C. Mal T.K. Hoeflich K.P. Inouye M. Ikura M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).For further biochemical characterization, purified His6MazF-mt1 was used to cleave a synthetic 15-base RNA (AGAUAU ↓ ACAUAUGAA), which was also shown to be cleaved between U and A of the UAC sequence (Fig. 3C, lane 2 and arrows). A 19-base DNA with a sequence identical to that of the RNA substrate in the center could not be cleaved (lane 4). When the DNA and RNA were mixed and treated with the enzyme, only RNA was cleaved (lane 5), indicating that MazF-mt1 is an endoribonuclease. To further test the cleavage specificity, five 11-base RNA substrates were synthesized, one with the UACA sequence in the center (AUAUACAUAUG) and the others with a G residue in each one of the UACA sequences. The first U and the second A residues could not be replaced with G (Fig. 3D, lanes 3-6). The third C residue also appears to be important, as the cleavage between U and A (lanes 7 and 8) was significantly reduced when this C was replaced with G. On the other hand, the fourth A residue was replaceable with G (lanes 9 and 10), confirming that MazF-mt1 is an endoribonuclease that specifically cleaves UAC sequence.The MazF-mt6 Is an mRNA Interferase—Because MazF-mt6 showed toxicity in E. coli (Fig. 2), we examined whether it, too, is a sequence-specific RNA interferase. We speculated that other MazF homologues are not toxic in E. coli, possibly because they may have highly specific cleavage activities and thus cleave only a very limited number of sequences in E. coli mRNAs or they are not efficiently expressed in E. coli. We carried out in vivo and in vitro primer extension experiments using the era mRNA and the MazF-mt6 protein. As shown in Fig. 4, a number of in vivo cleavage sites were detected in a time-dependent manner after its induction, all of which were also detected in an in vitro experiment with purified His6MazF-mt6 protein. Notably, a new cleavage site was also observed in an in vitro experiment in addition to those found in an in vivo (Fig. 4B, lane 10) experiment. These cleavages preferentially occurred in U-rich regions and after a U residue. Therefore, (U/C)U ↓ (A/U)C(U/C) may be assigned as a consensus cleavage sequence for MazF-mt6 mRNA interferase. The cleavage also occurred after G or A residues in some cases, although all cleavage sites contained UU, UC, or CU residues.DISCUSSIONIn this report, we have demonstrated that M. tuberculosis contains a number of MazF homologues, some of which were toxic to E. coli cells when induced. It has been shown that E. coli MazF causes complete cell growth arrest; however, the cells retain full metabolic activities (4Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that this novel physiological quasidormant state caused by MazF may be, in some ways, related to the long term dormancy of M. tuberculosis in human tissues. By having a large number of mRNA interferases that may be induced under different environmental conditions, the persistent dormancy of this pathogen in human tissues may be well regulated and may lead to antibiotic resistance.Microarray studies of the stringent response and the starvation response carried out with M. tuberculosis may provide insights into regulation of expression of the toxin genes in this pathogen. In the M. tuberculosis starvation model by Betts et al. (11Betts J.C. Lukey P.T. Robb L.C. McAdam R.A. Duncan K. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 717-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), MazF-mt4 (Rv0659c) was found to be down-regulated after 4 h of nutrient starvation. In a microarray study of a strain of H37Rv in which stringent response gene RelMtb is deleted, MazF-mt6 (Rv1102c) expression was shown to increase 3-fold after 6 h of starvation in the knock-out strain, whereas expression was unchanged after 6 h of starvation in wild-type Mtb (12Dahl J.L.

Both of these observations thereby directly implicate a role for RelMtb and (p)pppGpp (“the stringent response”) in the regulation of these toxin genes, namely down-regulation. However, the net effect on cell metabolism or viability of these changes in toxin expression depends on the respective changes in expression of their antitoxin counterparts. These results may be interpreted in the context of regulation of the mazEF operon in E. coli. When the stringent response is triggered in E. coli, the RelA-dependent increase of (p)ppGpp causes a decrease in activity of the P2 promoter of the mazEF operon (13Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Subsequently, MazE is degraded rapidly by ClpPA protease with a half-life of ∼30 min, whereas MazF is stable over a period of 4 h. Therefore, down-regulation of the mazEF operon results in the persistence of MazF as the amount of its cognate antitoxin MazE decreases. This ultimately leads to cell growth arrest. In M. tuberculosis, the observations so far are promising in terms of mirroring the mazEF regulatory system of E. coli. However, the challenge will be to identify and confirm the cognate antitoxins for the endoribonuclease toxins reported here, as well as to determine the precise genetic organization and regulation of these sets of genes. Furthermore, the reason why MazF-mt1 was expressed well in M. smegmatis is not known at present. It is possible that M. smegmatis contains enough semicognate antitoxin against MazF-mt1 under the growth condition used or MazF-mt1 is highly specific and thus does not show global effect in M. smegmatis.M. tuberculosis is one of the most devastating human pathogens, as one third of the world's population is infected with this pathogen and eight million people develop active disease each year. Two phenotypic properties of this pathogen account for these statistics: 1) latent infection sometimes referred to as dormancy and 2) persistence of infectious bacteria (14Zhang Y. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2005; 45: 529-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 15Balaban N.Q. Merrin J. Chait R. Kowalik L. Leibler S. Science. 2004; 305: 1622-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of latency and persistence are not well understood, recent studies of the TA systems in this pathogen suggest that these TA systems may be responsible for the dormancy of this pathogen in human tissues (16Arcus V.L. Rainey P.B. Turner S.J. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 360-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrating the existence of multiple mRNA interferases in M. tuberculosis support this notion, and further biochemical and genetic characterization of M. tuberculosis toxins will shed light into our understanding of their roles in the pathogenesis of this persistent human pathogen. Most bacteria contain “suicidal” or “toxic” genes whose expression leads to growth arrest and eventual death upon exposure to stress. These toxin genes are usually coexpressed with their cognate antitoxin genes present in the same operon (1Engelberg-Kulka H. Hazan R. Amitai S. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4327-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 2Gerdes K. Christensen S.K. Lobner-Olesen A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli chromosome contains six such operons called toxin-antitoxin (TA) 2The abbreviations used are: TA, toxin-antitoxin; ORF, open reading frame. 2The abbreviations used are: TA, toxin-antitoxin; ORF, open reading frame. systems. Of these, the MazE (antitoxin)/MazF (toxin) system is one of the most extensively characterized TA systems, and MazF has been shown to be a sequence-specific endoribonuclease that cleaves at ACA sequences in mRNAs (3Zhang Y. Zhang J. Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Qing G. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 4Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, MazF is an mRNA interferase, and its induction causes the effective inhibition of protein synthesis leading to cell growth arrest. However, MazF-induced cells fully retain cellular metabolic activities, including ATP production and amino acid and nucleotide synthesis, as well as RNA and protein synthesis. Therefore, MazF-induced cells are capable of synthesizing a protein, if the gene encoding this protein is devoid of ACA sequences (4Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This metabolically active dormant state caused by mRNA interferase induction is called “quasidormancy” (4Suzuki M. Zhang J. Liu M. Woychik N.A. Inouye M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 253-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and has important implications in the physiology of various pathogenic bacteria, including persistent multidrug resistance. Notably, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, one of the most devastating human pathogens, contains nearly forty TA systems on its genome, among which nine have been shown to be homologous to E. coli MazF (5Pandey D.P. Gerdes K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 966-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the TA modules play important roles in bacterial survival and formation of stable persisters in adverse conditions. These phenomena are essential for the persistence of M. tuberculosis. Persisters are the few rare pre-existing bacterial cells in a culture at any growth phase that are not growing and are intrinsically resistant to antibiotics by virtue of their subdued metabolism (6Keren I. Kaldalu N. Spoering A. Wang Y. Lewis K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 230: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 7Spoering A.L. Lewis K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6746-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we have characterized two of the MazF homologues from this pathogen, which showed high toxicity in E. coli when induced. We have demonstrated that these are indeed mRNA interferases that cleave specific RNA sequences. In view of the quasidormancy caused by MazF induction in E. coli, our results suggest that multiple mRNA interferases in M. tuberculosis may play a role in the multidimensional dormancy of this pathogen in human tissues. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Plasmids—E. coli BL21(DE3), BW25113 (ΔaraBAD) were used. Plasmids pET-28a-MazF-mt1 and MazF-mt6 were constructed using pET-28a (Novagen) to express His6MazF-mt1 and His6MazF-mt6. The plasmids pBAD-MazF-mt1 to pBAD-MazF-mt7 were constructed from pBAD vector, in which the protein expression can be tightly regulated by the addition of arabinose (0.2%).Purification of His6-tagged MazF-mt1 and MazF-mt6 Proteins Expressed in E. coli—His6MazF-mt1 and His6MazF-mt6 proteins tagged at the N-terminal end were purified from strain BL21(DE3) carrying pET-28a-MazF-mt1 and MazF-mt6, respectively, using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen).

Here, we demonstrate that the thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) gene is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in vivo. We previously showed that the recombinant inbred congenic strain HcB-19 has a spontaneous mutation of the Txnip gene, and we now show that the strain has dramatically increased incidence of HCC, and that the HCC cosegregates with the Txnip mutation. Approximately 40% of the Txnip-deficient mice developed hepatic tumors with an increased prevalence in male mice. Visible tumors develop as early as 8 months of age. Histological analysis confirmed the morphology of HCC in the Txnip-deficient mice. Molecular markers of HCC, α-fetoprotein and p53, were increased in tumors of Txnip-deficient mice. The upregulation of p53 preceded tumor development; however, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling of normal hepatic tissue of Txnip-deficient mice did not reveal increased cell proliferation. Finally, microarray analyses of tumor, non-tumor adjacent, and normal tissue of Txnip-deficient mice highlighted the genetic differences leading to the predisposition and onset of HCC. Our findings suggest that Txnip deficiency is sufficient to initiate HCC and suggest novel mechanisms in hepatocarcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2039286078,"Replication and transcription of the influenza virus genome takes place exclusively within the nucleus of the infected cells. The viral RNA genome, polymerase subunits, and nucleoprotein form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Late in the infectious cycle RNPs have to be exported from the nucleus to be enwrapped into budding progeny virions at the cell membrane. This process requires viral activation of the cellular Raf/MEK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)) signaling cascade that is activated late in the infection cycle. Accordingly, block of the cascade results in retardation of RNP export and reduced titers of progeny virus. In the present study we have analyzed the importance of cell-membrane association of the viral hemagglutinin glycoprotein for viral MAPK activation. We show that hemagglutinin membrane accumulation and its tight association with lipid-raft domains trigger activation of the MAPK cascade via protein kinase Cα activation and induces RNP export. This may represent an auto-regulative mechanism that coordinates timing of RNP export to a point when all viral components are ready for virus budding.

Influenza A and B viruses are important worldwide pathogens for humans and animals and cause devastating epidemic and pandemic outbreaks.

The Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is the prototype of MAPK cascades. Growth factor-induced signals are transmitted by consecutive phosphorylation from the kinase Raf via MEK to ERK, which translocates to the nucleus to phosphorylate a variety of substrates (17Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 20Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Intracellular signal transduction is usually initiated by membrane proximal events, including complex protein-protein interactions between ligands, receptors, and kinases. Lipid rafts on the cell surface have been shown to play a crucial role in these processes. These membrane structures are cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich dynamic assemblies, in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer. Such microenvironments form distinct areas within the lipid bilayer (21Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). They can change their size and protein composition in response to intra- or extracellular stimuli leading to specific protein-protein interactions. Lipid rafts can form platforms for receptors that are activated by ligand binding and other signaling components resulting in the activation of signaling cascades (22Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). Within lipid-raft domains kinases can alter the phosphorylation state of their substrates and membrane-anchored G-proteins can activate signaling, such as Ras that recruits Raf to the plasma membrane leading to the activation of MEK and ERK (22Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). The influenza A virus genome consists of eight RNA segments of negative polarity coding for at least 10 viral proteins. The three subunits (PB1, PB2, and PA) of the viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase and the nucleoprotein (NP) form the biological active ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Because influenza viruses pursue a nuclear replication strategy the RNPs must undergo bidirectional nuclear transport. Upon infection the RNPs are released into the cytoplasm and transported into the nucleus. The nuclear residency of the RNPs must be well coordinated to assure efficient viral genome replication and production of viral mRNAs/proteins, whereas late in the replication cycle newly formed RNPs have to be exported from the nucleus and transported to the cell membrane for virus assembly (23Cros J.F. Palese P. Virus Res. 2003; 95: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 24Nayak D.P. Hui E.K. Barman S. Virus Res. 2004; 106: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The HA serves two important functions early in the viral life cycle. It binds to the receptor determinant (25Lamb R.A. Krug R.M. Virology. 1996; (Lippincott-Raven Publishers, New York): 1487-1532Google Scholar) and induces fusion between the viral and the cellular membrane (26Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). As shown for other viral glycoproteins (27Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) HA is post-translationally acylated by addition of palmityl acids at three highly conserved cysteine residues (28Nobusawa E. Aoyama T. Kato H. Suzuki Y. Tateno Y. Nakajima K. Virology. 1991; 182: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 29Veit M. Kretzschmar E. Kuroda K. Garten W. Schmidt M.F. Klenk H.D. Rott R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 2491-2500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These modifications seem to be important for efficient fusion (30Wagner R. Herwig A. Azzouz N. Klenk H.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6449-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as well as for virus assembly and interaction of HA with lipid rafts (31Scheiffele P. Rietveld A. Wilk T. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2038-2044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 32Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K.

The virus-induced MAPK signaling is activated late in the viral replication cycle, and RNP nuclear export is dependent on this cellular function (3Pleschka S. Wolff T. Ehrhardt C. Hobom G. Planz O. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 4Ludwig S. Wolff T. Ehrhardt C. Wurzer W.J. Reinhardt J. Planz O. Pleschka S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 561: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our aim was to define viral factors/mechanisms that activate this MAPK signaling cascade. The facts that (i) Raf/MEK/ERK signaling is commonly activated by either membrane-resident or temporarily membrane-localized factors, (ii) HA associates with cholesterol and lipid rafts that can be involved in signaling (22Simons K.

Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), infected at the indicated multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.), and further incubated as described previously (3Pleschka S. Wolff T. Ehrhardt C. Hobom G. Planz O. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade was achieved by stimulation of cells with 100 ng ml–1 of the phorbol ester TPA.

For transient expression of dominant negative mutants of PKCα and Ras, MDCK cells were transfected with pCMV-PKCα K>R and pKRSPA-DN Ras (kindly provided by Ulf Rapp, MSZ Würzburg, Germany), respectively, and empty vectors as control. MDCK cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase Assays—To determine IFNβ-dependent reporter gene activation MDCK cells were transfected with the IFNβ promoter-dependent luciferase expressing plasmid pIFNβ-Luc using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were either mock transfected or transfected with poly(I/C) (Sigma) at different concentrations. Cell extracts were prepared at 4 h p.t. in cell lysis buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's description and assayed for luciferase activity using a Microplate Luminometer (Molecular Devices). Luciferase activities were determined from two independent transfections analyzed in duplicates. Immune Complex Kinase Assays, in Vivo Labeling, and Western Blotting—Cell lysates were used for Western blot analysis and immune complex kinase assays as described before (3Pleschka S. Wolff T. Ehrhardt C. Hobom G. Planz O. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Activated ERK and JNK were detected with phospho-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb, Santa Cruz Biotechnology and BD Transduction Laboratories). After stripping of bound antibodies total ERK2 and JNK1 were detected using rabbit polyclonal antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins recognized by primary Abs were further analyzed with peroxidase-coupled anti-species-specific Abs or streptavidin, followed by a standard enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Biosciences). To determine HA-ERK activity cell lysates were incubated with the 12CA5 anti-HA mAb (purified at the Institute of Molecular Virology, Muenster, Germany) and protein A agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were used for in vitro kinase assays with purified myelin basic protein (Sigma) as substrate for ERK as previously described (38Ludwig S. Engel K. Hoffmeyer A. Sithanandam G.

After Western blot, proteins were detected by a BAS 2000 Bio Imaging Analyzer (Fuji) and autoradiography. Quantification of specific bands was done with the PC-BAS software package (Fuji). Loading in the assays was monitored in Western blots using anti-ERK2- and anti-JNK1-specific antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the 12CA5 anti-HA mAb. HA-Surface Expression—MDCK cells were infected with different strains of influenza A virus as indicated (m.o.i. = 1). Cells were incubated for 8 h. Then the cells were detached with trypsin, fixed in PBS/4% paraformaldehyde, and stepwise incubated with anti-H7-HA mAb and then with anti-mouse FITC-conjugated mAb (Calbiochem) for 30 min on ice each. Finally, HA-surface expression was determined by FACS analysis using an ELITE Analyzer (Beckman Coulter) or FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Membrane Cholesterol Depletion and Quantification—To deplete membrane cholesterol MDCK cells grown in 10-cm dishes were washed with PBS and incubated with either fresh media or media containing 5 μm lovastatin to inhibit cholesterol synthesis (Sigma) for 7 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Then methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD, Sigma), solved in ddH2Oto deplete membrane cholesterol, was added (5 mm). Cells were incubated additionally for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. In the cholesterol re-addition experiment the compound (20, 200, and 400 μg) was solved in ethanol, mixed with MCD (5 mm) in a total volume of 80 μl of media, and then added to the cell supernatant. Cells were further incubated for 1 h before lysis. For cholesterol determination cell pellets were sonicated in 600 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) for 30 s. 120 μl of water was added, and after phase separation and centrifugation the chloroform layer was collected and dried in a stream of nitrogen (41Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43126) Google Scholar). Acetylation was performed by adding 500 μl of acetic anhydride/pyridine (4:1, v/v) and incubation for 16 h at room temperature. The sample was redissolved in 500 μl of dichloromethane, and 2 μl was used for gas chromatographic analysis (Philips, Pye Unicam PU 4500). Cholesterol acetate was separated on a CP Sil 24cp column (0.25-mm inner diameter, Macherey and Nagel, Germany) by raising the temperature from 250 °C to 325 °C at 6 °C/min and detected by flame ionization. Quantification was performed with acetylated cholesterol standards. A total of two samples of untreated and three samples of cholesterol-depleted cells was measured, and the standard error was calculated. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy and Immunofluorescence Assay (IFA)—MDCK cells grown on glass coverslips were infected as indicated, incubated in media with or without lovastatin (5 μm), MCD (5 mm), or TPA (100 ng ml–1, Sigma) as indicated, washed with PBS at the indicated time points post infection, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde with or without 1% Triton X-100 (in PBS) at room temperature. Then cells were incubated with the NP-specific mAb N7C4 (a kind gift from L. Stitz). Alternatively, infected cells were incubated with a combination of the NP-specific mAb and a phospho-specific anti-PKCα mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the H7-HA-specific mAb. After additional washes permeabilized cells were incubated with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) in PBS/3% bovine serum albumin (containing 300 ng ml–1 propidium iodide, Sigma, when indicated) for 1 h, washed, and mounted as described (3Pleschka S. Wolff T. Ehrhardt C. Hobom G. Planz O. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was visualized with a DM IRBE confocal laser scanning microscope (Leitz). Lipid-Raft Co-patching Assay—MDCK cells grown on glass coverslips were washed once with PBS and then incubated with FITC-conjugated choleratoxin B subunit (Ct-B, Vibrio cholerae, Sigma, 50 μg ml–1 in PBS/bovine serum albumin 3%) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, and then incubated with anti-Ct-B antibody (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by 15 min at 37 °C. After one additional washing step cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and mounted as above. Cell Viability Analysis—MDCK cells were grown in 96-well dishes and either left untreated or incubated in media containing 5 μm lovastatin for 7 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. Then MCD was added to a 5 mm final concentration. Cells were incubated for one additional hour. Medium was replaced by fresh medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics). After further incubation for 1 h the medium was replaced by 200 μl of MTT-Mix (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, antibiotics, containing tetrazolium bromide (175 μg ml–1, Sigma)). After 90 min incubation media were replaced by PBS/4% paraformaldehyde, and cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were dried and, after addition of isopropanol plates, vigorously agitated for 10 min at room temperature. Photometrical analysis was done at 550 nm excitation in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader (Diagnostic Pasteur Type LP 400). 16 samples of each group were measured, and the standard error was calculated. Viral Replication Intermediates Do Not Induce the Raf/MEK/ERK Signal Cascade—Activation of most of the influenza virus-induced signaling processes, such as JNK, p38, or NF-κB activation are primarily due to the accumulation of viral RNA (ssRNA or dsRNA) (42Ludwig S. Pleschka S. Planz O. Wolff T. Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In clear contrast to that, ERK is not activated in response to the dsRNA analog (poly(I/C)), although the compound in these concentrations readily activated the dsRNA-responsive IFNβ promoter. This strongly suggests a completely different mode of ERK activation (Fig. 1A). A further argument against viral dsRNA as an inducer of ERK activity comes from experiments using the ΔNS1 virus. Because this virus mutant lacks the viral dsRNA-binding protein NS1, infection with ΔNS1 resulted in a boost of dsRNA-induced signaling events compared with the isogenic wild type (wt) control. Although this was true for JNK1 activity, a known dsRNA effector, there was no change in ERK activation 9 h p.i. and even a reduced rather than an enhanced ERK activity 6 h p.i. if the mutant is compared with the wt-virus (Fig. 1B). This again strongly indicates that virus-induced ERK activation occurs by a dsRNA-independent mechanism. It might still be argued that virus-induced secretion of cellular factors, such as cytokines and chemokines, might lead to activation of the MAPK cascade in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. But when MDCK cells were analyzed for ERK activity after they were treated with UV-inactivated supernatants from either mock infected or virus-infected cells collected at different time points p.i., no effect on ERK activation was detected (data not shown). HA-Surface Expression Induces ERK Signaling and Nuclear RNP Export—Type A influenza virus-induced signaling displays a biphasic ERK activation both early and late in the viral replication cycle (3Pleschka S. Wolff T. Ehrhardt C. Hobom G. Planz O. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Interestingly the late phase of MAPK activation is absent upon nonproductive infection of HeLa cells (data not shown). These cells have been reported to show defects (i) in the maturation and membrane insertion of the HA, (ii) in M1 production, and (iii) in the budding process (43Gujuluva C.N. Kundu A. Murti K.G. Nayak D.P. Virology. 1994; 204: 491-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 44Lohmeyer J. Talens L.T. Klenk H.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Portincasa P. Conti G. Chezzi C. Virus Res. 1990; 18: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Influenza B virus infection only shows late ERK activity (4Ludwig S. Wolff T. Ehrhardt C. Wurzer W.J. Reinhardt J. Planz O. Pleschka S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 561: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We investigated whether HA-membrane accumulation could be a possible viral inducer of the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, which is normally activated by membrane resident cellular factors (17Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar, 46Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). MDCK cells were infected with wt influenza virus A/FPV/Rostock/34 and the Rostock-derived temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant ts227, that is characterized by a cell-surface transport defect of HA at non-permissive temperature (40 °C) resulting in severely reduced virus titers (48Schuy W. Will C. Kuroda K. Scholtissek C. Garten W. Klenk H.D. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2831-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). HA-surface expression of cells infected with either type of virus incubated at 33 °C and 40 °C was compared. Although HA-surface expression of wt-virus was reduced at 40 °C (60%), it was almost absent (4%) on ts227-infected cells (Fig. 2A). Analysis of MAPK activation by both viruses at different temperatures showed that at 40 °C ERK activation was not affected in wt-infected cells but reduced in ts227-infected cells at late time points of infection, where ERK activation normally increases (3Pleschka S. Wolff T. Ehrhardt C. Hobom G. Planz O. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 4Ludwig S. Wolff T. Ehrhardt C. Wurzer W.J. Reinhardt J. Planz O. Pleschka S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 561: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). To investigate MAPK signaling-dependent nuclear RNP export, intracellular RNP localization was investigated with cells infected with either virus incubated at 33 °C or 40 °C (Fig. 2C). The RNPs in wt-infected cells incubated at 33 °C or 40 °C were found in the cytoplasm at 10 h p.i. indicating efficient nuclear RNP export. In contrast only a small fraction of RNPs in ts227-infected cells incubated at 40 °C were found in the cytoplasm. It is thus tempting to speculate that HA-surface expression is functionally linked to the activation of MAPK signaling and concomitant viral RNP export. Stability of HA/Lipid-Raft Association Affects HA-induced MAPK Signaling—In wt-HA fatty acid side chains are attached to three highly conserved cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic tail at amino acid positions 551, 559, and 562 (numbering according to HA of A/FPV/Rostock/34). By employing recombinant Rostock virus mutants expressing HAs with alterations in these cysteine residues (mutants: Ac1, C551A; Ac2, C559A; and Ac3, C562A), it was demonstrated that loss of palmitylation from the distally located site significantly reduced the strength of HA/lipid-raft association (30Wagner R. Herwig A. Azzouz N. Klenk H.D. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 6449-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the tightness of the HA/lipid-raft interaction closely correlated with the infectivity in that weakening of raft association led to a clear reduction in virus particle infectivity, which was shown to be due to impaired HA fusion activity. Because lipid rafts are involved in signal transduction (22Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar), we investigated the importance of the HA/lipid-raft association for ERK activation. MDCK cells were infected at m.o.i. = 1 with either wt or the mutant viruses. ERK activation and intracellular RNP localization (Fig. 3, A and B) were analyzed at different time points p.i. The results show that ERK activation by wt, Ac1, and Ac2 did not significantly differ at 6, 8, and 10 h p.i., whereas obviously Ac3 infection always led to a reduced ERK activation compared with the wt (Fig. 3A). When the nuclear RNP export of wt- and Ac3-infected cells was compared, the onset of RNP export in wt-infected cells was observed to be around 6 h p.i., while at the same time point export in Ac3-infected cells was significantly retarded. Only as late as 8 h p.i. was the amount of cytoplasmic RNPs increased (Fig. 3B). The results indicate that tight association of HA with lipid rafts correlates with efficient induction of MAPK signaling. Membrane"
https://openalex.org/W2073051449,"The tumor suppressor p53 plays a crucial role in maintaining the genetic integrity of the cell and in suppressing cell transformation. Its cellular levels are usually low and rise substantially in response to DNA damage. Although research on p53 induction following DNA damage has mainly focused on the post-translational modification of p53 by Mdm2, it is known that protein translation also contributes to p53 induction. However, the mechanisms underlying translational regulation of the p53 protein in response to DNA damage are still poorly understood. We show that p53 synthesis increases dramatically in MCF-7 cells treated with etoposide. Interestingly, this increase is accompanied by an increase in the association of the translation initiation factor eIF-4E with its binding protein 4E-BP1, an inhibitor of cap-dependent protein translation. We further identified an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) located in the 5′-untranslated region of the p53 transcript, that is capable of driving the cap-independent translation of a downstream cistron encoding Firefly luciferase in a dicistronic expression vector. Moreover, we found that the activity of the IRES element increases in response to etoposide-induced DNA damage in MCF-7 cells. These findings provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of p53 translation in response to DNA damage."

Production of an antioxidant “firewall,” which would neutralize the oxidative assault generated by host immune defenses, is one proposed survival mechanism of the parasite. Schistosomes lack catalase, the main H2O2-neutralizing enzyme of many organisms, and their glutathione peroxidases are in the phospholipid class with poor reactivity toward H2O2. Evidence implicates peroxiredoxins (Prx) as providing the main enzymatic activity to reduce H2O2 in the parasite. Quantitative monitoring of Prx mRNAs during parasite life cycle indicated that Prx proteins are differentially expressed, with highest expression occurring in adult stages (oxidative resistant stages). Incubation of schistosomula with Prx1 double-stranded RNA knocked down total Prx enzymatic activity and resulted in lowered survival of cultured parasites compared with controls demonstrating that Prx are essential parasite proteins. These results represent the first report of lethal gene silencing in Schistosoma. Investigation of downstream effects of Prx silencing revealed an abrupt increase of lipid peroxides and the generation of several oxidized proteins. Using mass spectrometry, parasite albumin and actin were identified as the main oxidized proteins. Gene expression analysis showed that schistosome albumin was induced by oxidative stress.

Schistosomiasis is a severe, debilitating parasitic disease currently affecting 250 million people in the tropics, resulting in 20 million individuals with severe morbidity and 280,000 deaths annually (1King C.H.

In the coming years the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative and endemic country programs will treat hundreds of millions of people with praziquantel, the single anti-schistosomiasis drug in widespread use (3Fenwick A. Savioli L. Engels D. Bergquist R.N. Todd M.H. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 509-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). There is already clinical and laboratory evidence for the existence of praziquantel resistance parasites (4Cioli D. Botros S.S. Wheatcroft-Francklow K. Mbaye A. Southgate V. Tchuente L.A.

Parasitol. 2004; 34: 979-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and widespread use is expected to generate strong selective pressure for drug resistance. Clearly there is an urgent need for new anti-schistosome drugs. The presence of the parasite in the host hepatic mesenteries puts them under oxidative stress from immune-generated radicals as well as those potentially generated in the parasite during respiration and the breakdown and consumption of host hemoglobin with the concurrent release of toxic heme and ferrous ions. The addition of one electron to O2 produces superoxide, which is rapidly reduced to H2O2 by superoxide dismutase. The H2O2 formed is itself able to diffuse and cause cellular damage and must be neutralized to prevent the formation the more damaging hydroxyl radical. In many organisms intracellular H2O2 is eliminated by catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), 2The abbreviations used are: GPx, glutathione peroxidase; Prx, peroxiredoxin; RNAi, RNA interference; SECIS, selenocysteine insertion sequence; RT, reverse transcription; MDA, malondialdehyde; HAE, 4-hydroxyalkenals; DNP, dinitrophenyl; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-phosphate-dehydrogenase; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; MS, mass spectroscopy. and/or peroxiredoxins (Prxs). Schistosomes have abundant superoxide dismutase but completely lack catalase and have relatively low levels of GPx (5Mkoji G.M. Smith J.M. Prichard R.K. Int. J.

Furthermore, the known Schistosoma mansoni GPx is in the phospho-lipid hydroperoxide GPx class (GPx4) with poor reactivity toward H2O2 (7Williams D.L. Pierce R.J. Cookson E. Capron A. Mol. Biochem.

Peroxiredoxins are members of a recently identified family of antioxidants involved in the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide and other hydroperoxides (13Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G.

Prxs are also involved in redox balance and redox signaling processes and affect protein phosphorylation, transcriptional regulation, and apoptosis in animals (14Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Kim K.

All Prx have a reactive Cys in the N-terminal portion of the protein. Both classes of 2-Cys Prx contain a second C-terminal-located Cys. Mammalian cells express six isoforms of Prx; four typical 2-Cys (Prx I-IV), one atypical 2-Cys (Prx V), and one 1-Cys Prx (Prx VI). Both Prx III and Prx IV are found in the mitochondria. A number of studies confirm that Prx protect against oxidative stress in mammalian cells. Hemolytic anemia and increases in malignancies are seen in cytoplasmic Prx knock out animals (19Neumann C.A. Krause D.S. Carman C.V. Das S. Dubey D.P. Abraham J.L. Bronson R.T. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Van Etten R.A. Nature. 2003; 424: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 20Lee T.H. Kim S.U.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26159-26166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The three S. mansoni Prx proteins are ∼65% identical to each other and to typical 2-Cys Prx from mammals. Although S. mansoni Prx1 displays typical Prx kinetics and reactivity with Trx, Prx2 and Prx3 have unusual, saturable kinetics and higher reactivity with GSH than with Trx (12Sayed A.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26159-26166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Prx1 is unusual in that it is highly resistant to oxidative inactivation (12Sayed A.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26159-26166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). No atypical 2-Cys or 1-Cys Prx appears to be present in the S. mansoni genome. In this context we hypothesize that S. mansoni Prxs are essential in parasite redox balance mechanisms. In this study we investigate the expression schistosome Prx proteins during the parasite lifecycle and their subcellular localizations. Because schistosome Prx proteins are biochemically distinct from host Prx (12Sayed A.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26159-26166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), if they are essential for parasite survival they may prove to be novel targets for drug development. Because no specific Prx inhibitors are known, to test this hypothesis we have used RNA interference (RNAi) to silence Prx expression in larval parasites (schistosomula). Silencing of Prx leads to decreases in survival of parasites that depended on the level of oxidative stress they experienced. Silencing of Prx expression is not compensated by an increase in GPx expression but, instead, by expression of a parasite albumin. Schistosome albumin along with Prx appears to play a significant role in redox defenses of this important human parasite. Monoclonal Antibody Production—Recombinant S. mansoni Prxs were produced as His6 proteins and prepared as described (9Kwatia M.A. Botkin D.J. Williams D.L. J.

SP2/0 myeloma cells were kindly provided by Dr. Laura Vogel, Illinois State University. The specificities of the antibodies were checked with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western blotting (Amersham Biosciences) against recombinant Prx proteins. Parasite Preparation—Adult S. mansoni (NMRI strain) were obtained by perfusion of 6–7-week-infected mice (Biomedical Research Institute) by the method of Duvall and DeWitt (24Duvall R.H. DeWitt W.B.

Schistosomula were kept at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals) for 4 h, 24 h, 5 days, and 10 days. The 4-h, 24-h, and 5-day schistosomula from in vitro cultures represent skin-stage parasites, and the 10-day cultured schistosomula represent lung-stage parasites. Liver-stage parasites were obtained by perfusion of livers from mice infected 23 days previously with 500–1000 cercariae. This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Illinois State University (08-2002; Department of Health and Human Services animal welfare assurance number A3762-01). GPx2 Cloning and Analysis—The S. mansoni EST and genomic data base at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) and the Sanger Institute were queried with the S. mansoni GPx1 sequence (7Williams D.L. Pierce R.J. Cookson E. Capron A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 52: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to identify novel S. mansoni GPx genes. A TIGR tentative consensus sequence, TC4112, was identified that contained an EST (BF936248), which was generously provided by Dr. Philip LoVerde (State University at Buffalo). The nucleotide sequence of the complete insert of BF936248 was obtained using specific oligonucleotides and fluorescent dideoxy-terminator sequencing on an Applied Biosystems Inc. 310 automated sequencer. This sequence was deposited in GenBank™ with the accession number AY729668. The sequence was examined for the characteristic features of the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element using SECISearch 2.0 software program (26Kryukov G.V. Castellano S. Novoselov S.V. Lobanov A.V. Zehtab O. Guigo R. Gladyshev V.N. Science. 2003; 300: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fraction Preparation—Adult parasites were disrupted in 10× isolation buffer (0.33 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin) at 0 °C. Homogenates were settled by gravity for 20 min at 0 °C to sediment cell debris and unbroken cells and then centrifuged at 900 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to collect a nuclear pellet. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min to collect a mitochondrial pellet. The remaining supernatant was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 1 h to collect the microsomal fraction. The final supernatant was considered to be the cytosolic fraction. Pelleted fractions were suspended in isolation buffer with 200 μm protease inhibitor cocktails. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad). Lactate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase activities (27Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 1974; 2 (Academic Press, Inc., New York): 548-574Google Scholar, 28Green J.D. Narahara H.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1980; 28: 408-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were used as controls for cytoplasmic and mitochondrial fractions, and histone and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase proteins, detected by Western blot, served as controls for the nuclear and microsomal fractions, respectively. dsRNA Preparation—The entire coding sequence of S. mansoni Prx1 was amplified by PCR using primer (5′-AGCTAGCGAGATTTCCAAAGCATATGGT) and (5′-GAAGCTTTCATGTTTCATCTACAGATCGTCC) with 2 ng of Prx1-pRSetA as template and was cloned into pCRII-Topo vector (Invitrogen). In this plasmid the Prx1 open reading frame is flanked by SP6 and T7 RNA polymerase promoter sites. The resulting Prx1-pCRII plasmid was linearized and purified, and in vitro RNA transcription was conducted in 20-μl reactions according to manufacturer's protocols (Megascript, Ambion). Non-schistosome dsRNA (irrelevant dsRNA) was synthesized from pCRII-TOPO vector (280 base pairs between SP6 and T7 promoter sites) and used as the negative control. Equimolar amounts of single-stranded RNAs were mixed and heated to 68 °C for 25 min and cooled to room temperature for annealing. The dsRNAs were checked for purity and integrity by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Total RNA Isolation/Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was harvested from parasites after the course of an experiment by TRI reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Complementary DNA was synthesized using 1 μg of RNA and oligo (dT)x primer with 200 units of Thermoscript reverse transcriptase in a 25-μl reaction according to manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Real-time RT-PCR was carried out on Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR system using SYBR green dye (Molecular Probes). Primers for real-time RT-PCR were designed on Primer Express® software (Applied Biosystems) and selected for melting temperature (Tm) between 58 and 60 °C and amplicon size of 50–150 base pairs (Table 1). All target sequences and glyceraldehyde-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were validated for amplification efficiency (User Bulletin #2: ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system). Samples of cDNA from different parasite stages were diluted 1:5 with sterile, nuclease-free water and used in real-time PCR or diluted 1:500 for internal control gene levels. The reactions were performed in 25 μl according to previously published methods (29Vermeire J.J. Boyle J.P. Yoshino T.P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 135: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed in triplicate or quadruplicate, and product purity was checked through dissociation curves at the end of real-time PCR cycles. Statistical analysis of real-time RT-PCR data were carried out with the 2–ΔΔCT method (30Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

Methods for RNAi silencing were similar to those previously described (31Skelly P.J. Da'dara A. Harn D.A. Int. J. Parasitol. 2003; 33: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, double-stranded RNAs were added to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml (Prx1 or irrelevant non-schistosome RNA control) to 500 μg/ml schistosomula in 50 μl of water and 250 μl of RPMI medium containing 250 units/ml penicillin and 150 μg/ml streptomycin in 24-well tissue culture plates. Schistosomula were incubated at 25 °C for 25 min and then at 37 °C in a water-jacketed incubator with 5% CO2 atmosphere for the course of the experiment. Fifty microliters of fresh medium was added every 2 days to the wells. The cultured parasites were checked on a daily basis for viability. In the case of parasites under in vitro oxidative stress, H2O2 was added after 24 h of dsRNA treatment to ensure the maximum uptake of dsRNA by schistosomula. Controls without dsRNA treatment were run in parallel. Each treatment was carried out in triplicate, and experiments were done at least twice. The effect of RNAi on schistosomula cultured at reduced O2 tension was also investigated. Media were filter-sterilized and purged with different O2 content gases (0% O2, 5% O2 blood gas, or 20% O2) plus 5% CO2 before use for 20 min. The concentrations of dissolved O2 in the media were determined using an O2 electrode. Parasites were cultured during the course of the experiment under different O2 tensions at 37 °C in a sealed modular incubator chamber (Billups-Rothenberg) flushed with the appropriate gaseous mix. Fifty microliters of freshly purged media were added every 2 days to the wells. The viability of parasites was checked on a daily basis. Enhanced Chemiluminescent Western Blots—Total proteins from S. mansoni life stages and subcellular fractions were probed with monoclonal antibodies against Prx1, Prx2, and Prx3. The proteins were fractionated by 16% SDS-PAGE, blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blocked with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were probed with the primary monoclonal antibodies at a 1:2500 dilution at 25 °C for 2 h followed with 2 h of incubation secondary mouse antibody (1:2000) coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Protein bands were visualized using luminol as a substrate according to manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). Additional antibodies used were against chicken actin (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, The University of Iowa) detected with a goat anti-mouse IgM secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), against rabbit skeletal muscle sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (Affinity BioReagents), against bovine serum albumin (Sigma), against human β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and against human histone H1 (Santa Cruz). Specific Activity Determinations of S. mansoni Prx and GPx—Reduction of H2O2 or cumene hydroperoxide by schistosomula homogenates was measured in coupled reactions with recombinant Escherichia coli thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase (12Sayed A.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26159-26166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or glutathione and yeast glutathione reductase (Sigma) by consumption of NADPH at 25 °C in Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer as previously described (12Sayed A.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26159-26166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Lipid and Protein Oxidation Products—Measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxyalkenals (HAE) was used as an indicator of lipid peroxidation. The assay is based on the reaction of a chromogenic reagent, N-methyl-2-phenylindole, with MDA and HAE at 45 °C. The resulting chromophore has maximal absorbance at 586 nm. RNAi and irrelevant dsRNA-treated schistosomula were collected after 0, 3, 6, and 9 days of dsRNA treatment. The samples were sonicated in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.5 m butylated hydroxytoluene was added to inhibit any further oxidation of lipids. Sonicates were centrifuged to remove any cellular debris at 3000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Protein concentrations of the sonicates were determined using the Bradford assay. Two hundred microliters of the sonicate were mixed gently by briefly vortexing with 487.5 μl of 10.3 mm N-methyl-2-phenylindole (R1) in acetonitrile, 162.5 μl of 10 μm FeCl3 in methanol, and 150 μl of methanesulfonic acid. The reactions were incubated at 45 °C for 60 min. Absorbance of the samples was measured at 586 nm. Nonspecific changes in absorbance due to sample contribution were corrected by the sample blank (75% acetonitrile, 25% 10 μm FeCl3 in methanol). The MDA concentrations in samples were determined by comparison to the standard curve of MDA in methanesulfonic acid and HCl according to manufacturer's protocols (Oxford Biomedical Research). A range of 0.1–20 μm MDA standard was used. Schistosomula homogenates were derivatized with dinitrophenyl (DNP) hydrazine through the reaction of carbonyls produced by the reaction of proteins with reactive oxygen species with DNP hydrazine (32Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar). Both Prx1 dsRNA- and irrelevant dsRNA-treated schistosomula were collected after 0, 3, 6, and 9 days of treatment. The samples were sonicated in phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol to inhibit further protein oxidation. Sonicates were centrifuged to remove cell debris at 3000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Protein concentrations of the sonicates were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Five microliters of schistosomula homogenate were used for the DNP hydrazine derivatization reaction according to the manufacturer's protocol (Oxyblot™ protein oxidation detection kit, Chemicon International). Protein MS Analysis—The schistosomula homogenates from the RNAi treatment (days 3 and 9) were derivatized as described earlier and then neutralized to pH 7.4 with 2 m Tris, pH 9. The neutralized samples were incubated with rabbit anti-DNP antibodies (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C at 1:150 dilution. The samples were diluted 1:1 with binding buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 8) to obtain the optimum ionic strength and pH for protein A binding. Prepacked AffinityPak™ protein A columns (Pierce) were used for the purification. The column was equilibrated with 5 ml of the binding buffer, the samples were applied to the column, and the column was then washed with 15 ml of binding buffer. The DNP-labeled antibody conjugated proteins were eluted from the column using 4 ml of elution buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5). The eluted materials were collected in 0.3-ml fractions and immediately neutralized with 30 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 9. The eluted fractions were checked by 16% SDS-PAGE for the labeled proteins. The DNP-labeled protein fractions were also checked by Western blot analysis. Protein bands from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion protocol (33Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guilemot J. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) using trypsin (Promega) and analyzed on a Waters Q-ToF Ultima mass spectrometer with a Waters CapLC using a Waters C-18 Symmetry Nanoease column operating at 400 nl/min using solvents of water and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at the Mass Spectroscopy Laboratory, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Prominent ions observed during full scan were subjected to collision-induced fragmentation for MS/MS. The de novo sequencing was done using PEAKS version 2.4 (Bioinformatics Solutions, Inc.) and BLAST against NCBI-NR and S. mansoni databases using DNP-coupled Pro/Arg/Lys/Thr as variable post-translational modifications. Statistical Analysis—The significance of the decrease in worm survival were determined by two-tailed Student's t test. Monoclonal Antibody Production and Specificity—To understand the role of Prx in parasite redox mechanisms, we generated Prx paralog-specific monoclonal antibodies. Hybridomas were screened to ensure the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies against S. mansoni Prx proteins at least twice by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. Hybridomas that produced antibodies with no cross-reactivity with different Prx proteins were selected and expanded (results not shown). Characterization of GPx2, a Second GPx in S. mansoni—Analysis of the S. mansoni EST and genomic databases identified one additional GPx gene. The S. mansoni GPx2 cDNA was found to be 986 bases long encoding a 178-amino acid protein (GenBank™ accession AAU34080). Analysis of the GPx2-predicted peptide identified a 19-amino acid leader sequence with a likely cleavage site between amino acids 1"

While much is known about the mechanisms by which the estrogen-occupied estrogen receptor (ER) stimulates gene expression, the molecular events that lead to gene repression by the hormone-ER complex are largely unknown. Because estradiol represses expression of the cyclin G2 gene, which encodes a negative regulator of the cell cycle, our aim was to understand the mechanism by which cyclin G2 is repressed by estrogen. We show that cyclin G2 is a primary ER target gene in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that is rapidly and robustly down-regulated by estrogen. Promoter analysis reveals a responsive region containing a half-estrogen response element and GC-rich region that interact with ER and Sp1 proteins. Mutation of the half-ERE abrogates hormone-mediated repression. Mutational mapping of receptor reveals a requirement for its N-terminal region and DNA binding domain to support cyclin G2 repression. Following estradiol treatment of cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses reveal recruitment of ER to the cyclin G2 regulatory region, dismissal of RNA polymerase II, and recruitment of a complex containing N-CoR and histone deacetylases, leading to a hypoacetylated chromatin state. Our study provides evidence for a mechanism by which the estrogen-occupied ER is able to actively repress gene expression in vivo and indicates a role for nuclear receptor corepressors and associated histone deacetylase activity in mediating negative gene regulation by this hormone-occupied nuclear receptor.

In breast cancer, the presence of ERs is associated with likely response to endocrine therapy, most usually treatment with antiestrogens such as tamoxifen, or estrogen depletion by the use of aromatase inhibitors (6Katzenellenbogen B.S. Frasor J. Semin. Oncol. 2004; 31: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Estrogens enhance the proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cells, and recent studies have shown that this enhancement of proliferation involves both stimulation of the expression of many genes associated with cell cycle progression, as well as the suppression of genes that block the cell cycle (7Frasor J. Danes J.M. Komm B. Chang K.C. Lyttle C.R. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4562-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Most previous studies, focusing on the mechanisms that lead to stimulation of gene expression, have demonstrated that ERs can directly bind to perfect or imperfect palindromic DNA estrogen response elements (EREs) (8Klinge C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2905-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar) where they function as nucleation sites for assembly of the basal transcriptional machinery and a cohort of coactivators and chromatin remodeling complexes (e.g. p160 family, CBP/p300, mediator, and others) (9Hall J.M.

On the other hand, the molecular processes that lead to gene repression by the agonist ligand-occupied ER are largely unknown. Gene expression profiling on breast cancer cells using cDNA microarrays, which has proved to be a powerful tool for identifying estrogen receptor target genes, has revealed that in ER-containing breast cancer cells estrogen is able to down-regulate as many genes as it up-regulates (7Frasor J.

Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, these down-regulated genes include cell cycle inhibitory genes, such as cyclin G2, and proapoptic genes whose suppression by estradiol would enhance tumor cell growth and survival (7Frasor J. Danes J.M. Komm B. Chang K.C. Lyttle C.R. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4562-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The ability of estrogen to decrease cellular levels of cyclin G2, a negative regulator of the cell cycle, could play a critical role in the ability of this hormone to accelerate the transition of breast cancer cells through the cell cycle. Cyclin G2 shares homology with a recently discovered subgroup of cyclins that includes cyclin G1 (53% amino acid sequence identity) and cyclin I (30% amino acid sequence identity). These cyclins are expressed mainly in highly differentiated tissues, such as heart, muscle, and various regions of the brain (20Horne M.C. Donaldson K.L. Goolsby G.L. Tran D. Mulheisen M. Hell J.W. Wahl A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12650-12661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 21Horne M.C. Goolsby G.L. Donaldson K.L. Tran D. Neubauer M. Wahl A.F. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2113-2118PubMed Google Scholar). This group of cyclins has an atypical function, which does not seem to be associated with cell cycle progression but, instead, involves negatively controlling the cell cycle and maintaining cells in a quiescent state (20Horne M.C. Donaldson K.L. Goolsby G.L. Tran D. Mulheisen M. Hell J.W. Wahl A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12650-12661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because we have observed that cyclin G2 is robustly down-regulated following estrogen exposure of breast cancer cells, our aim in this study has been to elucidate the mechanism by which agonist hormone-occupied ER is able to elicit gene repression. Investigation of the cyclin G2 gene promoter, mapping of ER regions involved in cyclin G2 repression, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and other approaches provide evidence for an active mechanism by which the estrogen-bound ER is able to negatively regulate expression of this gene by the recruitment of nuclear receptor corepressors and associated HDACs. The ability of the estrogen-occupied ER to utilize distinct molecular strategies for gene repression versus gene activation appears to underlie the versatility of this transcription factor in enacting ligand-mediated gene expression in a promoter- and gene-specific manner. Such versatility of function underlies the integrated pattern of transcriptional response that breast cancer cells have to hormone treatment. Cell Culture, Treatments, and RNA Extraction—MCF-7 and HeLa cells were routinely cultured in minimal essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 1% antibiotics. Before treatments or transfections, the cells were maintained in phenol red-free minimal essential medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped calf serum for a minimum of 4 days with the medium changed every other day. Cells were generally treated with 10 nm E2 alone or in combination with other ligands for 2 h (unless different concentrations and times are indicated in figure legends). Total RNA was harvested and prepared using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Gliotoxin was purchased from Sigma. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Quantitative real-time PCR was performed as described previously (23Stossi F. Barnett D.H. Frasor J. Komm B. Lyttle C.R. Katzenellenbogen B.S.

Cyclin G2 Promoter Cloning—Three fragments of the human cyclin G2 promoter (F1, –485 bp; F2, –1043 bp; and F3, –1605 bp) were obtained by PCR from MCF-7 cell genomic DNA using the Pfx kit (Invitrogen) and directionally cloned into the BglII and MluI sites of the pGL3basic reporter vector (Promega Corp.) according to standard subcloning techniques. The plasmids were sequenced to confirm the fragment insertion and sequence. Transient Cell Transfections and Site-directed Mutagenesis—HeLa cells were transfected following Invitrogen's protocol available online. The luciferase assay system used was purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Luciferase values were normalized using a β-galactosidase gene-containing plasmid (pCMVβ, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as an internal control for transfection efficiency, as described previously (25Harrington W.R.

The amounts of plasmids used were: 1 μg of the reporter constructs, 100 ng of β-galactosidase, and 100 ng of estrogen receptor constructs. Every experiment was performed at least three independent times. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the F1 fragment of the cyclin G2 promoter using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. The mutagenesis sense and antisense primers were designed using the Stratagene web site. The sequence for the sense primer was: 5′-GGCCGGCGGACCGCGGCACGGCTCCTCC. The plasmids were then sequenced to confirm the mutation of the desired site. DNA Pulldown Assays—Pulldown assays were carried out as described (32Wood R.D. Annu. Rev.

Each annealed oligonucleotide (200 pmol) was adsorbed on to streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce). The nuclear extracts were prepared from MCF-7 cells that had been exposed to E2 for 15 min. The immobilized DNA was combined with 250 μg of MCF-7 nuclear protein, 2 mg of poly(dI-dC), 100 mm ATP, 120 mm KCl, and protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) in transcription buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 3.5% glycerol). After 2 h at 4°C, the beads were washed four times with transcription buffer containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis was carried out using ERα-specific antibody, Sc 8005 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described (34Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were treated with 10 nm E2 for 45 min before harvest. The antibodies used were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (HDAC-1 (N-19), HDAC-3 (H-99), HDAC-7 (H-273), N-CoR (C-20), SMRT (N-20), ERα (HC-20), and RNA polymerase II (N-20)), Upstate Biotechnology (acetyl-histone H4 (Lys16), Sp1, Sin3A) or NeoMarkers (IgG). The primers used for PCR were: cyclin G2 fw (5′-TCAGGTGGGGCATACCGAG) and rev (5′-CAAGTGCTCTGCCCCCAAA), which produce an amplicon of 343 bp. The primers used for pS2 were 5′-GGATTAAGGTCAGGTTGGAGG (forward) and 5′-CATGGTCAAGCTACATGGAAGG (reverse) and for the –5-kb region were: 5′-TGAGCAGGTTTGCAGCACACTT (forward) and 5′-CAGCCCCCAAGAACTTCCAG (reverse). 28–30 cycles of PCR were performed and the products were visualized on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel. Cyclin G2 Is a Primary Target Gene Down-regulated by Estrogen—Cyclin G2 was found to be an estrogen down-regulated gene in MCF-7 breast cancer cells in a microarray gene expression profiling study published by our laboratory (7Frasor J. Danes J.M. Komm B. Chang K.C. Lyttle C.R. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4562-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). To investigate further the mechanistic basis for the estrogen-dependent regulation of cyclin G2, we first carried out a complete time course analysis with time points ranging from 30 min to 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, cyclin G2 mRNA was rapidly reduced to ∼10% of the initial level by 2 h of treatment with 10 nm E2. Moreover, the levels of cyclin G2 mRNA remained at less than 40% of the initial level over the entire time course studied (Fig. 1A). A full dose-response curve at the 2-h time point was performed with E2 concentrations ranging from 10–12 to 10–6 m. Estrogen down-regulation was maximal at 10–10 m and above and showed an EC50 of ∼3 × 10–11 m (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the E2 hormone-evoked down-regulation was mediated through the ER, cells were treated with several ER agonist and antagonist ligands (Fig. 1C). The selective ERα agonist propyl pyrazole triol (35Stauffer S.R. Coletta C.J. Tedesco R. Nishiguchi G. Carlson K. Sun J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Katzenellenbogen J.A. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 4934-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar) also markedly down-regulated cyclin G2 expression, whereas treatment with the ER antagonists ICI182,780 or trans-hydroxytamoxifen had no effect alone, and they prevented the E2-mediated down-regulation, indicating a clear role for ER in mediating the repressive effect of E2 on this gene (Fig. 1C). To assess whether cyclin G2 is a primary ER gene target, we treated MCF-7 cells with the translational inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). Cycloheximide treatment was not able to block E2-mediated cyclin G2 mRNA down-regulation, indicating that the E2-ER complex has a direct effect on this gene and does not depend on other short-lived regulatory proteins (Fig. 2A). Because cyclin G2 mRNA is down-regulated by E2 at early times, we evaluated whether other intracellular signaling pathways might be involved in mediating or contributing to this effect. Thus, we tested the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 and the NFκB and proteasome inhibitor gliotoxin and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). Interestingly, only TSA was able to block the E2-mediated down-regulation of cyclin G2, suggesting a role for HDACs (Fig. 2B). LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, and gliotoxin, an NFκB and proteasome inhibitor, were without effect (Fig. 2B). Cloning and Deletion Analysis of the Human Cyclin G2 Promoter—The promoter for the human cyclin G2 gene was investigated first with a bioinformatics approach using the NCBI Genome data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the Gene2Promoter program to identify the translational start site and the putative promoter sequence. Transcription factor binding sites were then investigated using MacVector 7.0 and PromoterInspector programs. The region examined in this study covered from –2.5 to +0.15 kb, considering the ATG as +1. In this region, no classical palindromic EREs were identified, even allowing two mismatches from the consensus vitellogenin ERE. In the –1600 bp fragment of cyclin G2, three clusters of transcription factor binding sites known to mediate estrogenic responsiveness in other genes were found (Fig. 3A). In the distal (–1600/–1000 bp) and central clusters (–1000/–500 bp), various Sp1, NFκB, Forkhead, and AP-2 binding sites were found. The proximal cluster (–500/+150 bp) contained only one half-ERE, one Forkhead response element, and a GC-rich region (Fig. 3A). To evaluate whether any of these regions was necessary for E2-mediated down-regulation, these three fragments were isolated using a PCR-based approach and were directionally cloned in the luciferase reporter vector pGL3basic, which lacks promoter or enhancer elements. The three fragments, named F1, F2, and F3 and corresponding approximately to the –500, –1000, and –1600 bp fragments of the human cyclin G2 promoter, were transiently transfected along with ER into the ER-negative HeLa cell line. As shown in Fig. 3B, a 24-h treatment with E2 was able to significantly and reproducibly reduce by ∼40–60% the activity of all the fragments tested, indicating that the 489-bp F1 fragment appeared to be responsible for the E2-mediated down-regulation. It is also evident that the longer fragments contain elements that are important for maintaining basal promoter activity (Fig. 3B, open bars), as a progressive reduction in activity was observed across the promoter deletions from F3 to F1. Site-directed Mutagenesis Reveals a Role for the Half-ERE in the F1 Fragment of the Cyclin G2 Promoter—To evaluate the role of the half-ERE site present in the F1 promoter fragment (∼–500 bp), we used site-directed mutagenesis to alter this site. We changed 4 out of 5 bases of the half-ERE to ensure that the altered binding site would not be recognizable by the ER and also to introduce a unique SacII restriction site to facilitate colony screening. Transient transfections were performed in HeLa cells with multiple independent clones containing the desired mutation. We found that all of the half-ERE mutated clones (F1mut) were completely unresponsive to E2 (Fig. 3C and data not shown). This result indicates that the half-ERE element in the cyclin G2 F1 promoter region is necessary for repression by the E2-ER. Mapping of the Regions in ERα Involved in Cyclin G2 Promoter Regulation—To determine the regions of ERα required for repression of the cyclin G2 promoter, we compared the activity of wild type ERα with different ERα constructs containing deletions or mutations known to affect distinct functions of the receptor. Two dominant negative ERα mutants (Fig. 4), containing a point mutation (L540Q) or a frameshift mutation (S554fs) that abrogate AF-2 activity and coactivator binding but maintain ligand binding (30Schodin D.J.

Norris J.D. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1778-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 38Metivier R. Petit F.G. Valotaire Y. Pakdel F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1849-1871PubMed Google Scholar) that becomes more exposed in these dominant negative ERs. A triple point mutation in the DNA binding domain (DBDtm) that greatly reduces the affinity of the receptor for EREs completely abrogated the hormone elicited down-regulation, indicating that a functional DNA binding region is necessary for the ER-mediated repression. Likewise, deletion of the A/B domain (CDEF, which lacks the whole A/B domain) or deletion of only the first 21 amino acids of the receptor (N21) abrogated the repressive effect of estrogen, indicating an essential role for the N-terminal A domain (Fig. 4), a region shown to be important in interaction with the C-terminal part of the receptor (39Kraus W.L.

Since all of the receptors examined were expressed at similar levels, as seen in Fig. 4 and published for some of these receptors previously (30Schodin D.J. Zhuang Y. Shapiro D.J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14026-14032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the differences in receptor-repressive activity are not attributable to alterations in cellular receptor levels. Hence, regional mapping of ERα indicates an important role for the N-terminal region and the DNA binding domain in the repression of the cyclin G2 promoter and an enhanced repressive activity of dominant negative ERs with mutations in activation function-2 known to result in loss of coactivator binding (30Schodin D.J.

ERα Is Recruited at the Cyclin G2 Promoter in Vivo, and RNA Polymerase II Is Dismissed from the Cyclin G2 Promoter upon Estrogen Treatment—To examine ER recruitment to the cyclin G2 promoter in MCF-7 cells in vivo, we used ChIP assays. The cells were treated for 45 min with either control vehicle or 10 nm E2, after which chromatin was cross-linked with formaldehyde, and protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to ERα, RNA polymerase II, or anti-acetyl (K16)-histone H4. The PCR primers used encompass the half-ERE site. The pS2 promoter, which is stimulated by the E2-ER complex and contains an imperfect ERE (42Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control, and an unrelated region ∼kb upstream of the translational start site of the cyclin G2 promoter was used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 5A, ERα was recruited to the cyclin G2 promoter in a ligand-dependent manner. ERα was also recruited to the pS2 promoter but not to the unrelated (cyclin G2, –5 kb) region, as expected. RNA polymerase II was released from the cyclin G2 promoter upon E2 treatment, and histone H4 became deacetylated, indicating that with the E2-ER interaction, the chromatin in this region becomes a less permissive environment for transcription. A very different situation was seen at the pS2 promoter, where the ER acts as a transcriptional activator. Here, E2 treatment of cells resulted in recruitment of RNA polymerase II, accompanied by an increase in acetylated histone H4 (Fig. 5A). An N-CoR-HDAC-1-containing Complex Is Recruited at the Cyclin G2 Promoter—Because we found that the repressive effect of estrogen on cyclin G2 gene expression was reversed by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A and that ERα recruitment led to a hypoacetylated chromatin at the cyclin G2 promoter, as c"
https://openalex.org/W1967169951,"Altered expression of GATA factors was found and proposed as the underlying mechanism for dedifferentiation in ovarian carcinogenesis. In particular, GATA6 is lost or excluded from the nucleus in 85% of ovarian tumors and GATA4 expression is absent in majority of ovarian cancer cell lines. Here, we evaluated their DNA and histone epigenetic modifications in five ovarian epithelial and carcinoma cell lines (human 'immortalized' ovarian surface epithelium (HIO)-117, HIO-114, A2780, SKOV3 and ES2). GATA4 and GATA6 gene silencing was found to correlate with hypoacetylation of histones H3 and H4 and loss of histone H3/lysine K4 tri-methylation at their promoters in all lines. Conversely, histone H3/lysine K9 di-methylation and HP1gamma association were not observed, excluding reorganization of GATA genes into heterochromatic structures. The histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, but not the DNA methylation inhibitor 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, re-established the expression of GATA4 and/or GATA6 in A2780 and HIO-114 cells, correlating with increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation, histone H3 lysine K4 methylation and DNase I sensitivity at the promoters. Therefore, altered histone modification of the promoter loci is one mechanism responsible for the silencing of GATA transcription factors and the subsequent loss of a target gene, the tumor suppressor Disabled-2, in ovarian carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2007145550,"Mutational activation of ras genes is required for the onset and maintenance of different malignancies. Here we show, using a combination of molecular physiology, nutritional perturbations and transcriptional profiling, that full penetrance of phenotypes related to oncogenic Ras activation, including the shift of carbon metabolism towards fermentation and upregulation of key cell cycle regulators, is dependent upon glucose availability. These responses are induced by Ras activation, being specifically reverted by downregulation of the Ras pathway obtained through the expression of a dominant-negative Ras-specific guanine nucleotide exchange protein. Our data allow to link directly to ras activation the alteration in energy metabolism of cancer cells, their fragility towards glucose shortage and ensuing apoptotic death."
https://openalex.org/W2018029080,"Loss of articular cartilage because of extracellular matrix breakdown is the hallmark of arthritis. Degradative fragments of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a prominent noncollagenous matrix component in articular cartilage, have been observed in the cartilage, synovial fluid, and serum of arthritis patients. The molecular mechanism of COMP degradation and the enzyme(s) responsible for it, however, remain largely unknown. ADAMTS-12 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs) was shown to associate with COMP both in vitro and in vivo. ADAMTS-12 selectively binds to only the epidermal growth factor-like repeat domain of COMP of the four functional domains tested. The four C-terminal TSP-1-like repeats of ADAMTS-12 are shown to be necessary and sufficient for its interaction with COMP. Recombinant ADAMTS-12 is capable of digesting COMP in vitro. The COMP-degrading activity of ADAMTS-12 requires the presence of Zn2+ and appropriate pH (7.5-9.5), and the level of ADAMTS-12 in the cartilage and synovium of patients with both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis is significantly higher than in normal cartilage and synovium. Together, these findings indicate that ADAMTS-12 is a new COMP-interacting and -degrading enzyme and thus may play an important role in the COMP degradation in the initiation and progression of arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2006044964,"The interaction between stromal cells and tumor cells is emerging as a critical aspect of tumor progression. Yet there is a paucity of molecular markers for cells participating in such interactions, and only few genes are known to play a critical role in this process. Here, we describe the identification of ADAM12 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 12) as a novel marker for a subpopulation of stromal cells that are adjacent to epithelial tumor cells in three mouse carcinoma models (models for prostate, breast and colon cancer). Moreover, we show that ADAM12 is essential for tumor development and progression in the W10 mouse model for prostate cancer. These results suggest that ADAM12 might be a useful marker for stromal cells in mouse tumors that are likely to participate in stromal/tumor cell crosstalk, and that ADAM12 is a potential target for design of drugs that prevent carcinoma growth."

We compared normal human skeletal muscle cultures expressing dysferlin with muscle cultures from dysferlinopathy patients. We quantified the fusion index of myoblasts as a measure of muscle development and conducted optic and electronic microscopy, immunofluorescence, Western blot, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR at different developmental stages. Short interference RNA was used to corroborate the results obtained in dysferlin-deficient cultures. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to study myogenin activity in dysferlin-deficient cultures. Myoblasts fusion was consistently delayed as compared with controls whereas the proliferation rate did not change. Electron microscopy showed that control cultured cells at 10 days were fusiform, whereas dysferlin-deficient cells were star-shaped and large. After 15 days the normal multinucleated appearance and structured myofibrils were not present in dysferlin-deficient cells. Strikingly, myogenin was not detected in myotubes from dysferlin-deficient cultures using Western blot, and mRNA analysis showed low levels (p < 0.05) compared with controls. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence also showed reduced levels of myogenin in dysferlin-deficient cultures. When the dysferlin gene was knocked down (∼80%), myogenin mRNA leveled down to ∼70%. MyoD and desmin mRNA levels in controls and dysferlin-deficient cultures were similar. The reporter luciferase assay demonstrated a low myogenin activity in dysferlin-deficient cultures.

Two groups of MRFs are expressed in a temporally distinct pattern. Primary MRFs (MyoD and Myf-5) are required for myogenic determination, whereas the secondary MRFs (myogenin and MRF-4) are needed downstream of MyoD and Myf-5 as differentiation factors (10Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Null mutations in the myogenin gene cause a severe reduction of skeletal muscle mass, showing that myogenin is essential for muscle development in vivo (11Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J.M. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). Mutations in MyoD, Myf-5, and MRF-4 do not lead to morphological abnormalities of skeletal muscle (12Braun T. Rudnicki M.A. Arnold H.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 71: 369-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 13Rudnicki M.A. Braun T. Hinuma S. Jaenisch R.

In this study, we analyzed human skeletal muscle cultures from dysferlinopathy patients and normal controls at different developmental stages. Morphological changes and differences in the expression of the MRFs, MyoD as a proliferation muscle marker and myogenin as a differentiation marker, were studied using different methods. Primary Human Skeletal Muscle Cultures—Muscle biopsies from three normal controls (Dysf+/+) and from three sex and age-matched dysferlinopathy patients (Dysf–/–) with total absence of the protein in Western blot (W-B) and immunohistochemical analysis were used for this study. All muscle biopsies were taken from triceps muscle. Human muscle biopsies were minced and cultured in a monolayer according to the method described by Dr. Askanas (15Askanas V. Engel W.K. Neurology. 1975; 25: 58-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the culture medium for the myoblast stage contains 75% Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) and 25% M199 medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 μg/ml insulin, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, and 25 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor. To obtain highly purified myoblasts, primary cultures were sorted for the early surface marker CD56 by immunomagnetic selection. Each 107 cells were mixed with 20 μl of CD56-coated microbeads (Milteny Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and incubated at 6–12 °C for 15 min. Unbound microbeads were removed by washing cells in excess PBS buffer followed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS buffer to a concentration of 2 × 108 cells/ml before separation on a midiMACS cell separator (Milteny Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). CD56-positive cells were seeded at 2000 cells/cm2 using the culture medium for the myoblast stage containing 15% of FBS and without growth factors to avoid interference with the results. At day 10, when the myoblasts started to fuse, the medium was substituted with one containing 2% of FBS. The medium was changed twice a week, and the muscle cultures were examined to confirm confluent growth of myoblasts or myotubes. Each condition was performed in duplicate. We measured the fusion index (FI) at each stage (5, 10, and 15 days) by calculating the mean percentage of nuclei in myotubes in respect to the total number of nuclei (myoblasts + myotubes) found in five randomly chosen areas. A cell number count was conducted to the analyze culture growth rate at each stage. Electron Microscopy (EM)—Dysf+/+ and Dysf–/– myoblasts were seeded at 2000 cells/cm2 in a Lab-Tek chamber slides of 4 wells (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and were fixed in 3.5% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were postfixed in 1% OsO4 for 30 min at room temperature and stained in 2% uranyl acetate in the dark for 1 h at 4 °C. Finally, cells were rinsed in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.2), dehydrated in ethanol, and infiltrated overnight in Araldite (Durcupan, Fluka, Buchs SG, Switzerland). Following polymerization, embedded cultures were detached from the chamber slide and glued to Araldite blocks. Serial semi-thin (2μm) sections were cut with a diamond knife and mounted onto slides and stained with 1% toluidine blue. Semi-thin sections were glued (Super Glue) to Araldite blocks and detached from the glass slide by repeated freezing (in liquid nitrogen) and thawing. Ultrathin (0.05 μm) sections were prepared with an Ultracut UC-6 (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany), stained with lead citrate, and photographed on a Jeol 1010 CX electron microscope. Immunofluorescence—Cells cultured on glass coverslips were fixed in acetone:methanol (1:1), and immunofluorescence of human skeletal muscle culture was performed as described previously (16Illa I. Gallardo E. Gimeno R. Serrano C. Ferrer I. Juarez C. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 151: 81-88PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after 30 min in blocking solution, the samples were incubated overnight with a monoclonal antibody anti-desmin, anti-dysferlin (Novocastra, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), and anti-myogenin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), followed by 45 min with biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (5 μg/ml) (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). The samples were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with avidin-fluorescein (1 μg/ml) (Vector Laboratories Inc.). Coverslips were then mounted in a glycerol medium containing polyvinyl alcohol (Fluoprep, BioMerieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France). As a negative control, sections were processed using either an isotype-matched monoclonal antibody to an unrelated antigen (monoclonal mouse anti-cytomegalovirus) or without a primary antibody but using the same secondary antibody. The nuclei were dyed with ethidium bromide. Finally, the samples were examined using an Axioscop 2 plus photomicroscope equipped with epifluorescence optics (Carl Zeiss Microscope, Munich, Germany). Western Blot—Cell samples corresponding to each day analyzed (days 5, 10, and 15) were scraped from the human muscle culture dish and quickly weighed and homogenized twice for 15 s in 19 volumes of treatment buffer containing 0.125 mol/liter Tris/HCl buffer, pH 6.4, 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, 4 mol/liter urea, 10% mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue (final pH of treatment buffer was 6.8) as described previously (17Anderson L.V. Davison K. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1017-1022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The samples were placed in boiling water for 3 min and centrifuged at 9500 × g for another 3 min before 30 μl aliquots of the supernatants (equivalent to ∼200 μg of non-collagen protein) were applied to each lane. Unspecific binding sites on the blots were blocked by incubation in 5% low fat dried milk powder in a phosphate buffer saline. The primary mouse monoclonal antibody was then added. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Dako P260, Glostrup, Denmark) was applied at a 1:300 dilution when using anti-dysferlin antibody (Novocastra) and at a 1:10,000 dilution when using anti-β-actin (Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) as a primary antibody. When anti-myogenin antibody (BD Biosciences) was used as a primary antibody, the secondary antibody was a horse anti-mouse labeled to biotin (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by an enhanced chemioluminescence system (Pierce). Since myogenin and β-actin have a similar molecular mass (34 and 42 kDa, respectively), the membrane was first incubated with myogenin. After development, membranes were briefly washed with PBS and incubated for 15 min with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) to eliminate bound myogenin antibody. Membranes were then incubated with the antibody anti-β-actin, as indicated above. Flow Cytometry—One-color flow cytometry was performed for the detection of human myogenin. Monoclonal primary antibody anti human myogenin (clone D-10, mouse IgG3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and an IgG isotype control were used to stain myotubes from both normal controls and dysferlinopathy patients. Cells were trypsinized, fixed with cold 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at 4°C, and permeabilized with 0.4% Triton-X-100 for 15 min at 37 °C. Positive signals were detected by adding fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Europe Ltd., Cambridgeshire, UK). Cells were finally acquired and analyzed in a FACScan cytometer (BD Biosciences). Expression levels of myogenin were referred to as mean fluorescence index (M.F.I). RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR—RNA from muscle cultures at the three stages (days 5, 10, and 15) was extracted using Ultraspec (Biotech Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (0.2 μg) of muscle cultures at each stage was reverse transcribed into cDNA using TaqMan reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Quantification of the mRNA coding for dysferlin, desmin, MyoD, myogenin, and 18S as internal standard was performed using TaqMan Universal Master Mix technology (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed in a total reaction volume of 20 μl per well. The primers used for real time PCR were designed by Applied Biosystems: dysferlin, Hs 00243339_ml; MyoD, Hs 00159528_ml, myogenin Hs 00231167_ml, desmin Hs 00157258_ml, and 18S, Hs 99999901_s1 (Applied Biosystems). The comparative CT method (ΔΔCT) for relative quantification of gene expression was used. As long as the target and normalizer (18S) have similar dynamic ranges, this method is the most practical. The calculations for the quantification start with differentiating (ΔCT) between the target CT values and the normalizer: ΔCT = CT (target) – CT (normalizer). The ΔCT value was calculated for each sample. A pool of myoblast Dysf+/+ was used as a reference (base line). The comparative ΔΔCT calculates the difference between sample ΔCT value and the base-line ΔCT. Finally, the comparative expression level was obtained transforming the logarithmic values to absolute values using 2–ΔΔCT. The “t” test was used for statistical analysis. RNA Interference Dysferlin Knockdown—The oligonucleotides for the construction of a short interfering RNA (siRNA) were designed following the manufacturer's instructions for the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The sense and antisense siRNA oligonucleotide templates for dysferlin were: 5′-AAGAAGAGAACCAAAGTCATCCCTGTCTC-3′ and 5′-AAGATGACTTTGGTTCTCTTCCCTGTCTC-3′. The luciferase gene was used as a negative control, and the oligonucleotide templates used to create the double-stranded RNA were: 5′-AACTTGGCAAGTATACGGTTGCCTGTCTC-3′ and 5′-ACAACCGTATACTTGCCAAGCCTGTCTC-3′. The siRNA triggers degradation of homologous mRNA by the formation of double-stranded RNA. 25,000 cells/cm2 were transfected with siRNA/siPORT Amine (Ambion) at a concentration of 20 nm/6 μl. The appropriate transfection agent was determined previously, demonstrating that the amine siPORT transfection agent (Ambion) provided a stronger silencing effect as compared with the lipid siPORT transfection agent (Ambion) in these cells. Muscle cultures were incubated with siRNAs mix and the transfection agent alone and analyzed at 24, 48, and 72 h. Construction of Luciferase Reporter Gene Plasmids—We used RNA from control myotubes as a template to amplify a 329-bp fragment containing an E-box (CAGCTG), which is recognized by myogenin. An retrotranscriptase PCR reaction using a previously described primer pair (18Biederer C.H. Ries S.J. Moser M. Florio M. Israel M.A. McCormick F. Buettner R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26245-26251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that appended unique BglII and NheI sites on the 5′- and 3′-ends was performed. The amplified sequence was digested using BglII and NheI restriction enzymes (Promega, Madison, WI) and cloned in frame into a pGL3-basic luciferase vector (Promega) opened with the same set of enzymes. The ligation reaction was performed using T4 DNA ligase (Promega). The correct open reading frame and the orientation of the cloned fragment were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid pGL3-basic containing the E-box recognized by myogenin was purified using endotoxin-free Maxiprep (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Transient Transfection—Myoblasts from Dysf+/+ and Dysf–/– were seeded at 5000 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates 1 day before the transfection. Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) at a ratio of 1:6. As internal control for each transfection, cells were co-transfected with 10 ng of the plasmid RL-TK (Promega) expressing Renilla under the herpes simplex virus promoter. Luciferase Assay—The culture medium was discarded after 48 h, and cells were washed twice with PBS. For the luciferase assay, we used the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Transient transfectants were harvested with lysis buffer, and the luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (Victor 3, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The values obtained were normalized with Renilla activity. We used the pGL3-basic vector without insert as a negative control. Myotube Formation Is Slower in Dysf–/– than in Dysf+/+ Muscle Cultures—The analysis of cellular growth of Dysf–/– human muscle cultures compared with Dysf+/+ cultures showed no significant differences in the proliferation rate (Fig. 1A). However, at days 10 and 15, while the FI increased considerably in Dysf+/+ muscle cultures, it remained very low in Dysf –/– muscle cultures (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1B). Electron Microscopy Revealed Abnormal Differentiation of Dysf–/– Primary Cultures—Morphological differences were appreciated in semi-thin sections and EM at 10 and 15 days of culture. At day 10, while Dysf+/+ cultured cells were mostly fusiform, with a diameter of 10–20 μm and often multinucleated, Dysf –/– myoblasts were in general star-shaped and had a diameter of 30–50 μm. At EM, Dysf –/– myoblasts showed enlarged rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) cisterns, large Golgi complexes, and a heterogeneous population of lysosomes. Smooth endoplamic reticulum was greatly developed. In contrast, in Dysf+/+ cells, RER cisterns were not enlarged or only slightly enlarged. Lysosomes were not abundant, and the heterogenous shapes found in Dysf–/– were not observed. At 15 days of culture, analysis by light microscopy demonstrated some myotube Dysf+/+ containing up to eight nuclei (Fig. 2A). However, in Dysf –/– muscle cultures the majority of myotubes were binucleated (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, some of the images observed resembled fusion phenomena by phagocytosis. Indeed, many picnotic nuclei were found, in agreement with the scarce number of cells bearing more than one nucleus in Dysf –/– cultures. At this point, Dysf+/+ cells had a more prominent fusiform shape, whereas Dysf –/– cells remained star-shaped. The myofibril structure was clearly observed in Dysf+/+ cells (Fig. 2, C and E) but was not visible in Dysf –/– cells. Myofibril structure was disorganized in Dysf –/– cells (Fig. 2D). RER remained enlarged in Dysf –/– muscle cells, and the number of lysosomes and vacuoles was higher than in Dysf+/+ (Fig. 2F). Mitochondrial morphology was also very irregular in Dysf–– cultures at 15 days, compared with that of Dysf+/+ cells. Dysferlin Expression Is Absent in Myotube Dysf –/–—Immunofluorescence results showed that there were no dysferlin expression in myoblasts in control cultures at days 5 and 10. When myoblasts started to fuse to form myotubes, dysferlin expression increased, reaching its maximum levels at day 15 following the pattern previously described (9De Luna N. Gallardo E. Illa I. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 63: 1104-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, dysferlin accumulated at the growing bud (end of the myotube) from day 15 (Fig. 3, A–C). In Dysf –/– cultures, we did not detect dysferlin expression at any of the three stages (days 5, 10, and 15) (Fig. 3, D–F). Dysferlin expression in human primary muscle cultures from control biopsies was detectable from day 10 using W-B analysis. Protein expression remained at similar levels until day 15. W-B of dysferlin in Dysf –/– muscle cultures showed no bands corresponding to the molecular mass of dysferlin or lower at any of the stages analyzed either in myoblasts or in myotubes (data not shown). MyoD Expression Is Normal, but Myogenin Is Reduced in Dysf–/– Muscle Cultures—MyoD and desmin mRNA levels were no different from those of control cultures. MyoD expression in control cultures was higher in the proliferation than in the differentiation stages, reaching its maximum levels at day 5. MyoD expression showed the same pattern in Dysf–/– cultures at all the days analyzed, with slightly reduced levels as compared with controls. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Myogenin expression was tested at days 5, 10, and 15 in Dysf+/+ and Dysf –/– skeletal muscle cultures. In Dysf+/+ cultures, myogenin was expressed from day 10. However, in Dysf –/– cultures, no bands corresponding to myogenin protein were observed at any of the stages analyzed (Fig. 4A). Immunofluorescence of Dysf –/– myotubes using an anti-myogenin antibody showed that the nuclei staining were weaker than in control myotubes (Fig. 4, B and C). Using flow cytometry, we then examined whether myogenin expression in control myotubes was higher than in Dysf–/–. A flow cytometry assay with an anti-human myogenin antibody showed a decreased expression of myogenin in the Dysf–/– myotubes (M.F.I.: 12.4) compared with Dysf+/+ myotubes (M.F.I.: 20.3) (Fig. 4D). Similar results were obtained when mRNA levels were studied, showing that a reduced expression of myogenin paralleled a reduction of dysferlin mRNA in Dysf –/– muscle cultures (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5, A and B). Dysferlin siRNA Effectively Reduces Dysferlin mRNA Levels—To further demonstrate the link between dysferlin and myogenin mRNA expression, we performed real-time PCR on cultures treated with dysferlin siRNA. Dysferlin mRNA was not reduced in the first 24 h. However, after 48 h of treatment with dysferlin siRNA, cultures showed a significant reduction of dysferlin mRNA (∼80%) compared with those treated with luciferase siRNA (p < 0.01). This observation paralleled with a reduction of myogenin of ∼70% (p < 0.01) observed in cultures treated with dysferlin siRNA (Fig. 6). At 72 h, both dysferlin and myogenin mRNA reached normal levels of expression. As a control, we analyzed desmin mRNA expression and no differences were found between cultures treated with dysferlin siRNA or luciferase siRNA. At 24, 48, and 72 h we also analyzed the FI, and no differences were found between muscle cultures treated with dysferlin siRNA and the controls. Luciferase Reporter Activity Containing an E-box Activated by Myogenin Was Lower in Dysf–/– Patients—To demonstrate the reduction of myogenin levels observed in Dysf –/– cultures, we performed a functional study using a pGL3-basic luciferase reporter plasmid containing a specific E-box as a myogenin target. Luciferase assays demonstrated significant differences between Dysf+/+ and Dysf –/– cultures. The reporter gene was highly expressed in Dysf+/+ cultures, indicating that myogenin had a normal activity. In contrast, in Dysf –/– cultures the reporter expression of firefly Renilla activated by myogenin was significantly decreased (p < 0.001) (Fig. 7). This result suggests that myogenin down-regulation in Dysf –/– cultures may have functional implications. Our study in human skeletal muscle primary cultures shows that the absence of dysferlin remarkably alters the process of muscle differentiation in vitro and points to a signaling pathway that would involve dysferlin and myogenin. The cultures from the three Dysf –/– muscles showed complete absence of dysferlin expression in the cellular membrane both in myoblasts and myotubes at all stages analyzed. In contrast, the three normal primary cultures showed that dysferlin was progressively up-regulated from the myoblast to the myotube stage, as described previously (9De Luna N. Gallardo E. Illa I. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 63: 1104-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The absence of dysferlin seen in vitro correlated with the absence of dysferlin in vivo in the muscle biopsy of the three patients studied both by immunofluorescence and W-B. By means of immunohistochemistry, we also found an accumulation of dysferlin at the sites of the myotubes where myoblasts fuse (growing buds) in Dysf+/+ muscle cultures, suggesting the involvement of dysferlin in fusion events. Semiquantitative real-time PCR showed a low expression of dysferlin mRNA in Dysf –/– muscle cultures at the myotube stage. This was probably due to an instability of dysferlin mRNA and may explain why we did not detect the protein product by W-B or immunohistochemistry. In view of the lack of expression of dysferlin at the myoblast stage in normal muscle, we did not anticipate significant differences between Dysf –/– and Dysf+/+ cultures, and in fact, the proliferation rate in Dysf –/– myoblasts was similar to that of controls. Accordingly, the levels of the primary MRF MyoD did not differ from Dysf+/+ cultures. In contrast, in Dysf –/– cultures, myoblasts showed a reduced FI as compared with control cultures. Strikingly, Dysf –/– cultures displayed a reduction of myogenin mRNA levels by semiquantitative real-time PCR, and the protein was undetectable by W-B. These findings were confirmed at the protein level using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, which showed a severe reduction of myogenin in Dysf –/– myotubes. These results suggest that myogenin could be involved in the defective muscle differentiation observed in Dysf –/– cultures, measured as lower FI. When we analyzed myogenin mRNA levels at early stages (days 5 and 10), we found that it was low both in Dysf+/+ and Dysf –/– muscle cultures, in agreement with the function of this secondary MRF, which is expressed with the differentiation toward the myotube stage. In addition, using a luciferase activity-based assay, we demonstrated a diminished activity of myogenin only in Dysf –/– myotubes. This potential link between dysferlin and myogenin was further confirmed by siRNA assays, since the knockdown of dysferlin gene in vitro conveyed a myogenin mRNA reduction. All together, these findings suggest that dysferlin is somehow involved in the muscle differentiation pathway conducted by myogenin. As described previously, myogenin expression in Dysf+/+ cultures was up-regulated during myoblast differentiation both in culture and in vivo (19Sassoon D. Lyons G. Wright W.E. Lin V. Lassar A. Weintraub H. Buckingham M. Nature. 1989; 341: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), in a similar pattern to dysferlin expression in vitro (9De Luna N. Gallardo E. Illa I. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 63: 1104-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Continuous cell lines of myoblasts isolated from myogenin mutant embryos from null mice deficient in myogenin normally differentiate in culture (20Nabeshima Y. Hanaoka K. Hayasaka M. Esumi E. Li S. Nonaka I. Nature. 1993; 364: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), indicating that various myoblast differentiation pathways must co-exist in vitro. In vivo, homozygous mutant myogenin null mice die perinatally due to a severe defect in the diaphragm. These mice presented a significant reduction in skeletal muscle mass throughout the body (11Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J.M. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 20Nabeshima Y. Hanaoka K. Hayasaka M. Esumi E. Li S. Nonaka I. Nature. 1993; 364: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, the number of myoblasts appeared to be normal, confirming that myogenin is not required for lineage commitment but is needed for terminal differentiation. In agreement with these observations, the ultrastructure of Dysf –/– myoblasts/myotubes differed from that of control cultures. Our findings in Dysf –/– muscle cultures correlated with the original description of muscle biopsies from Miyoshi myopathy patients in which abnormalities of Z-disk, loss of myofilaments, dilatation of RER, and sarcolemmal vacuoles were observed (21Miyoshi K. Kawai H. Iwasa M. Kusaka K. Nishino H. Brain. 1986; 109: 31-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Myofiber disorganization and absence of Z-lines is also observed in homozygous mutant myogenin null mice (11Hasty P. Bradley A. Morris J.H. Edmondson D.G. Venuti J.M. Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Nature. 1993; 364: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 20Nabeshima Y. Hanaoka K. Hayasaka M. Esumi E. Li S. Nonaka I. Nature. 1993; 364: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Together with other ultrastructural disturbances, the absence of properly organized myofibrils at day 15 confirms the impairment in muscle differentiation observed in skeletal muscle cultures from dysferlinopathy patients. Myogenin is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix gene family, which is essential for muscle development. In adult skeletal muscle myogenin expression is coincidental with satellite cell differentiation and fusion (22Cooper R.N. Tajbakhsh S. Mouly V. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Butler-Browne G.S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2895-2901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we have reported that dysferlin is expressed in activated satellite cells in adult skeletal muscle (9De Luna N. Gallardo E. Illa I. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 63: 1104-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) indicating its role in muscle regeneration. In addition, dysferlin is involved in sarcolemmal repair mechanisms (6Bansal D. Miyake K. Vogel S.S. Groh S. Chen C.C. Williamson R. McNeil P.L. Campbell K.P. Nature. 2003; 423: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The interaction of dysferlin with annexins A1 and A2 indicates that they may play a role in the aggregation and fusion of intracellular vesicles in response to membrane injury (7Lennon N.J. Kho A. Bacskai B.J. Perlmutter S.L. Hyman B.T. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50466-50473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Caveolin-3, which has been shown to interact with dysferlin (23Matsuda C. Hayashi Y.K. Ogawa M. Aoki M. Murayama K. Nishino I. Nonaka I. Arahata K. Brown Jr., R.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), could also participate in vesicle fusion to the sarcolemma. Dysferlin also interacts with affixin, an intracytoplasmic protein that accumulates in the disruption site of the membrane and plays an important role in wound healing (24Matsuda C. Kameyama K. Tagawa K. Ogawa M. Suzuki A. Yamaji S. Okamoto H. Nishino I. Hayashi Y.K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 64: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All these data point to the hypothesis that dysferlin could act as a calcium sensor that regulates membrane repair machinery (25Doherty K.R. McNally E.M. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 327-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Indeed, the calcium-sensitive interaction of the C2A domain of dysferlin with phospholipids supports its role in membrane fusion events. However, since dysferlin is a large protein, and the remaining five C2 domains do not necessarily bind Ca2+ and phospholipids, it is reasonable to hypothesize that they may participate in protein-protein interactions (8Davis D.B. Doherty K.R. Delmonte A.J. McNally E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22883-22888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and signal transduction pathways (26Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15879-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The absence of dysferlin would impair these other functions and, among other effects, disrupt myogenin expression. Further studies are needed to elucidate which proteins/factors interact with C2 domains of dysferlin to positively regulate myogenesis by increasing myogenin gene transcription. In conclusion, this study supports the role of dysferlin in human muscle fusion and differentiation in vitro. Furthermore, it provides evidence of a link between dysferlin and myogenin and suggests they share a signaling pathway involved in differentiation of skeletal muscle in vitro."

Defective expression of frataxin causes Friedreich ataxia (FA), an inherited degenerative syndrome characterized by ataxia, cardiomyopathy, and high incidence of diabetes. Here we report that frataxin-deficient cells are more prone to undergo stress-induced mitochondrial damage and apoptosis, while the overexpression of frataxin confers protection to a variety of cell types. Moreover, we reveal the existence of an extramitochondrial pool of frataxin, which can efficiently prevent mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in different cellular systems. Remarkably, extramitochondrial frataxin can fully replace mitochondrial frataxin in promoting survival of FA cells. Frataxin is a mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism.

Koenig M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Age at onset may range from 5 to 25 years, and loss of deambulation ensues 10–20 years from the onset. Progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a frequent cause of premature death. FA is caused by the defective expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin, due to, in most cases, homozygous GAA triplet repeat expansion within the first intron of the FRDA gene (2Patel P.I. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 15-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Frataxin is required for animal development, since its complete loss results in embryonic lethality in the mouse (3Cossee M. Puccio H. Gansmuller A. Koutnikova H. Dierich A. LeMeur M. Fischbeck K. Dolle P. Koenig M. Hum. Mol.

Testi R. Aging Cell. 2005; 4: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Partial expression of frataxin allows organismal development and survival, yet results in progressive degeneration of specific tissues. In fact, frataxin deficiency in humans critically affects survival of large primary neurons of the dorsal root ganglia, cardiomyocytes, and pancreatic beta cells, accounting for FA syndromic features. Frataxin cooperates to the biogenesis of iron-sulfur clusters (ISC) (5Muhlenhoff U. Richhardt N. Ristow M. Kispal G. Lill R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2025-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 6Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Am. Chem.

Tong W.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Moreover, frataxin may physically interact with mitochondrial aconitase and ETC components (8Bulteau A.L. O'Neill H.A. Kennedy M.C. Ikeda-Saito M. Isaya G. Szweda L.I.

Benada O. Isaya G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 217-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in a homopolymeric form capable of ferroxidase activity (11O'Neill H.A. Gakh O. Isaya G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Frataxin can also donate iron to ferrochelatase, which catalyzes the insertion of iron into protoporphyrin IX, thus helping in heme synthesis (12Yoon T. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25943-25946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Cells derived from FA patients have a partial defect in ISC-containing proteins, with consequent inefficient mitochondrial respiration (13Ristow M. Pfister M.F. Yee A.J. Schubert M. Michael L.

This may cause higher sensitivity to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (15Wong A. Yang J. Cavadini P. Gellera C. Lonnerdal B. Taroni F. Cortopassi G. Hum. Mol.

Lett. 2002; 320: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Accordingly, FA patients experience oxidative stress (18Schulz J.B. Dehmer T. Schols L. Mende H. Hardt C. Vorgerd M. Burk K.

Neurology. 2000; 55: 1752-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and animal models of frataxin deficiency show accelerated cell death caused by enhanced oxidative stress (20Ristow M. Mulder H. Pomplun D. Schulz T.J. Muller-Schmehl K. Krause A. Fex M. Puccio H. Muller J. Isken F. Spranger J. Muller-Wieland D. Magnuson M.A. Mohlig M. Koenig M. Pfeiffer A.F. J. Clin.

In other models, however, iron accumulation and oxidative stress may have little pathogenic role (22Seznec H. Simon D. Bouton C. Reutenauer L. Hertzog A. Golik P. Procaccio V. Patel M. Drapier J.C. Koenig M. Puccio H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Indeed, although current therapy for patients affected by Friedreich ataxia relies mostly upon the use of antioxidants, considerable controversy exists about the role of oxidative stress in FA pathogenesis (23Schulz T.J.

Here we show that an extramitochondrial form of mature frataxin autonomously contributes to oxidative stress resistance and overall cell survival.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—The following reagents were used: C2-ceramide (Biomol), GD3 ganglioside, staurosporine, and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (Sigma), Hoechst 33342, MitoTracker Red CMXRos, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE), and dihydroethidium (HE) (Molecular Probes). The antibodies used were as follows: anti-frataxin clone 1G2 (Immunological Sciences), anti-voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (Calbiochem), anti-Hsp60 clone LK-1 and anti-manganese-superoxide dismutase (StressGen), anti-cytochrome c clones 6H2.B4 and 7H8.2C12 (PharMingen), anti-α-tubulin (Sigma), and anti-p110 mitochondrial protein clone 2G2 (Kamiya Biomedical).cDNA Expression Constructs—Human frataxin cDNA containing EcoRI site at 5′-end/BamHI at 3′-end was obtained by PCR from the plasmid pTLX1 (ATCC) and inserted in pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech) bicistronic expression vector. Frataxin cDNA was furthermore cloned into HindIII and BamHI sites of the expression pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 construct was synthesized by PCR using the primers 5′-CTAGGAATTCATGTCGAACCAACGTGGCCTCAAC-3′ (EcoRI) and 5′-AGTTGGATCCGCATCAAGCATCTTTTCCGG-3′ (BamHI), to remove the first 55 amino acids from frataxin precursor, and inserted in pcDNA3 or pIRES2-EGFP vectors. pIRES2/Bcl-2 was generously provided from P. Bonini (University of Florence, Florence, Italy). Human 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase cDNA MGC-40361 was obtained from ATCC and subcloned in pIRES2-EGFP.Cell Culture and Transfections—GM15850B lymphocytes, from a clinically affected Friedreich ataxia patient, homozygous for the GAA expansion in the FRDA gene with alleles containing ∼700 and 1050 repeats, and GM15851B lymphocytes from a clinically unaffected brother of GM15850, with two FRDA alleles in the normal range of GAA trinucleotide repeats, were obtained from NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository, Coriell Institute for Medical Research. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% FBS and transfected by electroporation. Briefly, 107 cells were incubated in 0.4 ml of RPMI 1640 for 10 min on ice with 20 μg of pcDNA3 empty vector or pcDNA3/frataxin constructs. After electroporation at 260 V, 950 microfarads, cells were left 30 min on ice and resuspended in 5 ml of RPMI 1640, 15% FBS. After 4 h, live cells were recovered by Lympholyte-H (Cedarlane Laboratories) density gradient centrifugation and replated. Stable transfectants were obtained from cultures in selection medium containing 400–600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 15–20 days. Human embryonic kidney HEK-293 and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Human T-cell lymphoma HuT78, T-cell leukemia Jurkat, and bone marrow neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. HEK-293 cells were transfected with the calcium phosphate precipitation method: cells were plated on 10-cm dishes and transfected with 15 μg of total DNA of indicated plasmids. After 16 h the medium was replaced with a fresh one and cells harvested for protein extracts after 24 h from transfection. HuT78 cells were transfected by electroporation as described above, while for Jurkat and SH-SY5Y cells Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used, following the manufacturer's instructions.Apoptosis, Mitochondrial Depolarization, and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Production—Apoptotic FA and healthy lymphoblasts were detected after staining with annexin V-PE (PharMingen) following the supplier's instructions; mitochondrial inner membrane depolarization was detected after incubation of treated cells with 50 nm TMRE for 20 min at 37 °C, whereas ROS production was quantitated by incubation with 4 μm HE for 20 min at 37 °C. Apoptosis of transiently transfected cells was determined by counting Hoechst 33342-stained fragmented nuclei among GFP-positive cells. Blind counting by two investigators, of at least 300 cells, was performed for each group. ROS production in transfected SH-SY5Y cells was determined as described above, by dual color flow cytometry, analyzing red fluorescence among electronically gated green fluorescent cells.Analysis of Cytochrome c Release—Lymphoblasts from FA-affected and healthy individuals were treated with 0.4 μm staurosporine, harvested after 4–6 h, and resuspended in 100 μl digitonin (50 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 100 mm KCl) for 5 min on ice. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times in PBS, and incubated in blocking buffer (3% BSA, 0,05% saponin in PBS) for 1 h. After incubation overnight at 4 °C with anti-cytochrome c or anti-Hsp60 1:200 in blocking buffer, cells were washed three times and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with PE-labeled secondary anti-mouse antibody (PharMingen), diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer. Quantitative analysis was performed by flow cytometry.Confocal Microscopy Analysis—HeLa cells were plated onto glass chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and grown in complete medium for an additional day after plating. Viable cultures were either first exposed for 20 min at 37°C to 100 nm MitoTracker Red CMX diluted in control medium or directly fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Coverslips were rinsed once with PBS and permeabilized for 30 min at 37 °C with 60 μm digitonin, followed by a blocking step, with PBS containing 10% FBS, overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 1:100 dilution of anti-frataxin mAb, anti-p110 mitochondrial protein mAb or anti-Hsp60 mAb, followed by secondary BODIPY-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes), washed, and mounted on glass slides with Prolong Antifade (Molecular Probes). Confocal images were acquired by using a PCM-2000 confocal microscope (Nikon) and were then processed by using EZ C1 software (Nikon).Subcellular Fractionations—To isolate mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, cells were harvested, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspendend into an ice-cold isotonic buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from different healthy donors were isolated by lymphoprep density gradient centrifugation at 800 × g and treated as above. Cells were then passed through a 30-gauge syringe needle several times. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to eliminate nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged twice at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and collected as a cytosolic fraction. The heavy membrane pellet, which contained mitochondria, was washed in the isotonic buffer and resuspended in a hypotonic buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors. To partition the cytosolic fractions into P100 and S100 fractions, further centrifugations were performed at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. For total protein extracts, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Total, mitochondrial, and cytosolic fractions were then analyzed by Western blotting and revealed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSTo investigate the role of frataxin in promoting cell survival, we took advantage of lymphoblastoid cells derived from a FA patient, which express very low levels of frataxin, and control lymphoblastoid cells derived from a healthy brother of the patient (Fig. 1A). Lymphoblasts were exposed to death-inducing doses of ceramide, as a general and conserved mediator of cellular stress responses (24Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25847-25850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 25Reynolds C.P. Maurer B.J. Kolesnick R.N. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), to ganglioside GD3, which specifically targets mitochondria and promotes apoptosis (26De Maria R. Lenti M.L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 27Malisan F. Testi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), to the kinase inhibitor staurosporine and to UVB. Fig. 1B shows that FA lymphoblasts were more sensitive to ceramide, to GD3, and to staurosporine, as measured by apoptosis induction, than their related controls. However, frataxin deficiency did not affect their sensitivity to UVB (over a wide range of doses; data not shown). A similar spectrum of sensitivity was observed when mitochondrial inner membrane depolarization (Fig. 1C) and production of ROS (Fig. 1D) were measured. Importantly, FA lymphoblasts released cytochrome c from mitochondria more readily that their healthy controls, when exposed to staurosporine (Fig. 2). Collectively, these results indicate that frataxin-deficient cells are more sensitive to several, yet not all, major inducers of cellular stress.FIGURE 2FA cells are more susceptible to stress-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Lymphoblastoid cells derived from the healthy brother or from the FA patient were left untreated (open areas) or exposed to 0.4 μm staurosporine (dark areas) and cytochrome c release quantitated by FACS analysis after 4 h. Cells were stained with isotype-matched control anti-HSP60 mAb (upper panels) or with anti-cytochrome c mAb (lower panels). The fraction of cells in which cytochrome c is released is indicated by the horizontal bar. One representative experiment, out of three performed with similar results, is shown. In this experiment, cells that released cytochrome c were 15% (untreated) versus 42% (after staurosporine) for the healthy donor, and 12% (untreated) versus 69% (after staurosporine) for the FA patient. In the corresponding area of the histogtams, cells stained with control mAb were less than 7% in all conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then directly addressed the ability of frataxin to suppress apoptosis by overexpressing frataxin in different cell lines. Frataxin is normally synthesized as a 210-amino acid precursor. Subsequently, N-terminal mitochondrial localization sequences allow the import of the precursor into the mitochondria, where a mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) sequentially cleaves the precursor after Gly41 and Ala55 releasing an intermediate product, and eventually the 155-amino acid mature, functional mitochondrial frataxin (28Cavadini P. Adamec J. Taroni F. Gakh O. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41469-41475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 29Koutnikova H. Campuzano V. Foury F. Dolle P. Cazzalini O. Koenig M. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). To verify whether the mitochondrial localization is obligatory for its function, we generated a frataxin deletion mutant, extramitochondrial frataxin56–210, lacking the first 55 residues, including the N-terminal mitochondrial import sequences. This mutant therefore corresponds to the mature frataxin and cannot be recruited into the mitochondria. Although this mutant was produced according to the reported MPP cleavage site (RA55:S) yielding the mature product (28Cavadini P. Adamec J. Taroni F. Gakh O. Isaya G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41469-41475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), when transiently expressed in several cell lines it migrated slightly slower than mature frataxin proteolytically generated from the wild type construct (Fig. 3B). The latter corresponds to the genuine mature product, since it co-migrated with the endogenous frataxin present in each cell line. To verify the compartmentalization of the frataxin products, the wild type and the extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells, and cell fractionations were performed. SDS-PAGE and Western analysis of the fractionated cell lysates confirmed that the cytosolic protein tubulin partitioned within the cytosolic fractions and that the mitochondrial VDAC and cytochrome c associated with the mitochondrial fractions. As expected, the extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 generated a product that did not associate with the mitochondria (Fig. 3C). Unexpectedly, however, the mature product from wild type frataxin was not only found associated with the mitochondria but was also found in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Processing and localization of frataxin. A, schematic representation of the 1–210 frataxin precursor, its intermediate (42–210) processing product, and the mature (56–210) mitochondrial frataxin. MIS, mitochondrial import sequences. B, HEK-293 cells, HeLa cells, and SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with empty vector (ev), the wild type frataxin (F), or the extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 (EF). The different products were visualized by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with anti-frataxin antibodies. The asterisk indicates a frataxin degradation product. C, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with wild type frataxin (F) or extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 (EF). Total cell lysates (T), cytosolic (C), and mitochondrial (M) fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-tubulin, anti-VDAC, anti-cytochrome c, and anti-frataxin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The T-cell lymphoma HuT78 cells undergo massive apoptosis when exposed to ceramide. We found that the transient expression of frataxin protects HuT78 cells toward ceramide-induced apoptosis, to the extent achieved by the transient expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (Fig. 4A). The overexpression of a different mitochondrial protein, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, was ineffective. HuT78 cells also undergo apoptosis in response to endogenous GD3 accumulation, as induced by the transient expression of GD3 synthase (ST8). The simultaneous co-expression of frataxin prevented ST8-induced apoptosis, similarly to the protection conferred by Bcl-2 co-expression (Fig. 4B). These findings were extended to additional cellular systems, such as the lymphoid cell line Jurkat and the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. In both cases the transient expression of frataxin significantly suppressed ceramide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C). Both in Jurkat and in SH-SY5Y cells, however, frataxin could not block UVB-induced apoptosis.FIGURE 4Frataxin suppresses apoptosis. A, HuT78 cells were transiently transfected with pIRES2 empty vector (ev), pIRES2/3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (HBD), pIRES2/wild type frataxin (F), pIRES2/Bcl-2 (B), or pIRES2/extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 (EF) and exposed to 50 μm C2-ceramide. At the indicated time points apoptosis was quantitated by Hoechst staining. B, HuT78 cells were transiently transfected with pIRES2 empty vector only (open column) or transiently transfected with pcDNA3/GD3 synthase (ST8) (dark columns) and simultaneously co-transfected with pIRES2 empty vector (ev), pIRES2/wild type frataxin (F), pIRES2/Bcl-2 (B), or pIRES2/extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 (EF). Apoptosis induction was quantitated after 24 h by Hoechst staining. C, Jurkat cells and SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with pIRES2 empty vector and left untreated (open columns) or transiently transfected pIRES2 empty vector (ev), pIRES2/wild type frataxin (F), or pIRES2/extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 (EF) and exposed to 50 μm C2-ceramide (dark columns) or to 1200 J/m2 UVB (gray columns). Apoptosis induction was quantitated after 16 h by Hoechst staining. D, SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with either pIRES2 empty vector (ev), pIRES2/wild type frataxin (F), or pIRES2/extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 (EF), labeled with HE, and left untreated or exposed to 50 μm C2-ceramide. After 16 h, cells were analyzed by FACS, and transfected cells were selected by electronic gating (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fluorescence intensity displayed on the x axis is a measure of ROS content of transfected cells. Broken lines, untreated cells; solid lines, ceramide-treated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Quite unexpectedly, in all instances the expression of the extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 was at least as effective in apoptosis protection as the expression of wild type frataxin (Fig. 4, A–C). Moreover, as detected by hydroethidine staining and FACS analysis, extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 transiently expressed in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells suppressed ceramide-induced ROS production as efficiently as wild type frataxin (Fig. 4D).Together these results suggest that mature frataxin may not be only confined to the mitochondria and that an extramitochondrial pool of frataxin can control ROS production and apoptosis. To exclude that the presence of mature frataxin outside the mitochondria observed in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 3C) was due to forced expression, we investigated the distribution of endogenous frataxin by immunostaining and confocal microscopic analysis in HeLa cells. Fig. 5 shows that a substantial amount of frataxin does not co-localize with the mitochondria, as revealed by simultaneous MitoTracker staining, while complete co-localization can be detected between mitochondria and the p110 mitochondrial protein or the mitochondrial matrix protein HSP60.FIGURE 5Detection of extramitochondrial frataxin. HeLa cells were immunostained for frataxin, for the p110 mitochondrial protein or for HSP60 (green), while mitochondria were simultaneously revealed by MitoTracker staining (red). Co-localization is rendered in the merge panels (yellow). Subcellular distribution of frataxin and mitochondria was analyzed by microscopic confocal analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To verify that the non-mitochondrial endogenous frataxin corresponded to the endogenous ∼17-kDa mature product, different cell lines were subjected to cell fractionation followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Fig. 6A shows that in HeLa cells, tubulin was recovered in the cytosolic fraction, while VDAC, the mitochondrial matrix chaperone HSP60, the mitochondrial matrix manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase, or cytochrome c were recovered in the mitochondrial fraction. Frataxin, however, was recovered both in the mitochondrial and in the cytosolic fractions. Further fractionation of the cytosolic fractions at 100,000 × g revealed that extramitochondrial frataxin is mostly distributed into the S100-soluble cytosol (data not shown). Frataxin was similarly found in the cytosolic fraction in two additional cell lines, SH-SY5Y and Jurkat, as well as in resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal donors (Fig. 6B). In all instances, the cytosolic fractions contained frataxin, and its molecular size corresponded to the mature mitochondrial frataxin.FIGURE 6Endogenous extramitochondrial frataxin corresponds to the mature form of the protein. A, total cell lysates (T), cytosolic (C), and mitochondrial (M) fractions from HeLa cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-tubulin, anti-VDAC, anti-HSP60, anti-manganese-superoxide dismutase, anti-cytochrome c, and anti-frataxin antibodies. B, total cell lysates (T), cytosolic (C), and mitochondrial (M) fractions from SH-SY5Y cells, Jurkat cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from a representative normal donor were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-tubulin, anti-VDAC, anti-HSP60, anti-cytochrome c, and anti-frataxin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further analyze the functional capability of extramitochondrial frataxin, both wild type and extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 were stably expressed into the frataxin-deficient FA lymphoblasts (Fig. 7A).

As shown in Fig. 7, the expression of the extramitochondrial frataxin56–210 was at least as effective as the expression of the wild type frataxin in granting protection to ceramide, measured by triggering of apoptosis (Fig. 7B), induction of mitochondrial inner membrane depolarization (Fig. 7C), and production"
https://openalex.org/W2006681864,"In many organisms, an increasing number of proteins seem to play two or more unrelated roles. Here we report that maize sucrose synthase (SUS) is distributed in organelles not involved in sucrose metabolism and may have novel roles beyond sucrose degradation. Bioinformatics analysis predicts that among the three maize SUS isoforms, SH1 protein has a putative mitochondrial targeting peptide (mTP). We validated this prediction by the immunodetection of SUS in mitochondria. Analysis with isoform-specific antisera revealed that both SH1 and SUS1 are represented in mitochondria, although the latter lacks a canonical mTP. The SUS2 isoform is not detectable in mitochondria, despite its presence in the cytosol. In maize primary roots, the mitochondrion-associated SUS (mtSUS; which includes SH1 and SUS1) is present mostly in the root tip, indicating tissue-specific regulation of SUS compartmentation. Unlike the glycolytic enzymes that occur attached to the outside of mitochondria, SH1 and SUS1 are intramitochondrial. The low abundance of SUS in mitochondria, its high Km value for sucrose, and the lack of sucrose in mitochondria suggest that mtSUS plays a non-sucrolytic role. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate that SUS interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel in an isoform-specific and anoxia-enhanced manner and may be involved in the regulation of solute fluxes into and out of mitochondria. In several plant species, at least one of the SUS proteins possesses a putative mTP, indicating the conservation of the noncatalytic function across plant species. Taken together, these observations suggest that SUS has a novel noncatalytic function in plant cells. In many organisms, an increasing number of proteins seem to play two or more unrelated roles.

Taken together, these observations suggest that SUS has a novel noncatalytic function in plant cells. In both plant and animal cells, a small number of catalytic and structural proteins play additional roles that in some cases are regulatory in nature (1Jeffery C.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 8-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 2de Lanerolle P. Johnson T. Hofmann W.A. Nat. Struct. Mol.

These “moonlighting” proteins possess the ability to assemble into multiprotein complexes and mediate sophisticated biological functions such as integrating signals. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) 2The abbreviations used are: GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; SUS, sucrose synthase; MtSUS, mitochondrion-associated SUS; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; AOX, alternative oxidase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1, 1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. is the most studied among such versatile proteins (4Sirover M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 159-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Besides its pivotal role in energy metabolism, GAPDH is shown to be involved in membrane fusion, microtubule assembly, RNA transport, DNA replication and repair, and cell death (5Hara M.R. Agrawal N. Angwon Kim S.F. Cascio M.B. Fujimuro M. Ozeki Y. Takahashi M. Cheah J.H. Tankou S.K. Hester L.D. Ferris C.D. Hayward S.D. Snyder S.H. Sawa A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The functional diversity of GAPDH is facilitated by its ability to interact with other proteins and translocate to multiple subcellular compartments. Sucrose synthase (SUS) catalyzes the reversible conversion of sucrose and UDP into fructose and UDP-glucose and is a key player in plant sucrose catabolism. In maize, the following three genes encoding sucrose synthase are known: sus1, sus2, and sh1. The isoforms encoded by these genes are symbolized SUS1, SUS2, and SUS-SH1, respectively (6Chourey P.S. Maize Genet. Coop. Newslett. 2006; 80 (in press)Google Scholar). In this study, for the sake of simplicity, we call the SUS-SH1 isoform SH1. All the three isoforms are predominantly recovered as soluble (cytosolic) proteins from plant cells, in accordance with their predicted secondary structures. The well documented function of this enzyme is in energy metabolism, by its catalysis of sucrose degradation. However, recent studies show that a portion of the protein can exist as a membrane-bound form in association with the cellulose/callose synthase complex, thus contributing to cell wall biosynthesis (7Amor Y. Haigler C.H. Johnson S. Wainscott M. Delmer D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9353-9357Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 8Winter H. Huber J. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Subbaiah C.C. Sachs M.M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the roots of intact maize seedlings subjected to prolonged anoxia, SUS protein showed a steady accumulation in the root tip region, and much of the protein was associated with the membrane fraction. This increased membrane association of SUS correlated with an induction of callose accumulation in the root tip (9Subbaiah C.C. Sachs M.M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A redistribution of SUS activity with a concomitant increase in the content of cell wall carbohydrates has also been observed in O2-deprived wheat roots (10Albrecht G. Mustroph A. Planta. 2003; 217: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mutant analysis indicated that this response may be paralog-specific. The SH1 isoform of the enzyme, encoded by the shrunken1 gene, is more responsive to O2 deprivation than the SUS1 protein encoded by the sus1 gene. Our interest is to elucidate the basis of the isoform-specific response of sucrose synthase in anoxic maize cells. An examination of the protein sequences revealed that the SH1 protein is marked by a putative mitochondrial targeting signal at its N terminus. In this study, we have investigated the significance of this sequence-based prediction. Our results show that two of the three maize SUS isoforms exist in the organelles of maize seedling tissues. In addition to this isoform specificity, the dynamic changes in the mitochondrion-associated SUS (mtSUS) levels in response to developmental as well as environmental cues, its interaction with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC; an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, also known as mitochondrial porin), and an apparent conservation of mitochondria-targeted SUS among plant species indicate that the mtSUS may play an important role in the inter-compartmental signaling in plant cells. Plant Material and Genetic Backgrounds—The maize (Zea mays L.) inbred line B73Ht was used for all studies, except when mutants were the subject of investigation. sh1-ref, sh1-bz1-x1, sus1, and sh1sus1 double mutants used in the study were described in Subbaiah and Sachs (9Subbaiah C.C. Sachs M.M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Maize seeds were germinated and seedlings grown as carried out previously (11Subbaiah C.C. Zhang J. Sachs M.M. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Seedlings used in the study had only the primary root (5–8 cm) with two small seminal roots (≤1 cm) and a pre-emergent shoot (where the primary leaves were still enclosed in the coleoptile) of 5–8 cm. The terms “tip” and “axis” apply to the 1-cm apical region and the distal portions of the primary root, respectively (12Subbaiah C.C. Kollipara K. Sachs M.M. J. Exp. Bot. 2000; 51: 721-730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anoxia was imposed by submerging the seedlings in “flooding buffer” as detailed in Subbaiah et al. (13Subbaiah C.C. Bush D.S. Sachs M.M. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1747-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Mono-specific polyclonal antisera were raised against peptide sequences unique to SH1 (EFDALFDSDKEKYAP), SUS1 (MGEGAG-DRVLSRL), and SUS2 (HHILDALDEVQGSGGR) in rabbits, affinity-purified, and used as described in Duncan et al. (14Duncan K.A. Hardin S.C. Huber S.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibodies was tested using recombinant SUS1 and SUS2 proteins. Results with maize SUS mutants presented in this study further confirm their specificity. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) that detects all maize SUS isoforms was a gift from Prem Chourey (University of Florida, Gainesville) and was described earlier (9Subbaiah C.C. Sachs M.M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fumarase antibodies are from the David Oliver laboratory, Iowa State University, Ames. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for alternative oxidase and VDAC are from Tom Elthon (University of Nebraska, Lincoln). Bioinformatics—Secondary structure predictions were done using several programs available in the public domain, but the representative results presented here are from the PELE tool available at the Biology WorkBench site. SUS proteins were queried in TargetP, version 1.01, a two-layered neural network method for predicting subcellular targeting of proteins based on their N-terminal sequences (15Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar). We have also used Predotar, which is also a neural network-based prediction program for in silico localization of proteins to the chloroplast, mitochondrion, both, or neither of the organelles (16Small I. Peeters N. Legeai F. Lurin C. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Default settings were used for the Predotar. User-defined settings were selected for TargetP to indicate the plant origin of sequences and with “no cut-off” stringency for all sequences tested. Cell Fractionation and Purification of Mitochondria—Three-day etiolated maize seedlings or indicated seedling parts were homogenized in 0.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and inhibitors of proteases, phosphatases, and kinases (20 mm NaF, 10 mm Na2MoO4, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 μm microcystin-LR, 1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 1 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-bezenesulfonylfluoride, 5 mm 6-amino caproic acid, 2 μm N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-Leu-4-guanidinobutylamide, and 5 μm leupeptin). Except in preparations intended for analyzing cytosolic proteins, 0.5% bovine serum albumin was included in the homogenization buffer. The nuclei were pelleted at 500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was spun at 3,000 × g for 10 min to collect the etioplasts. Mitochondria were pelleted from the post-plastid supernatant by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The crude mitochondria were loaded onto a discontinuous Percoll gradient (15-35–53%) and centrifuged in a swing-bucket rotor at 13,000 × g for 45 min. Mitochondria banded between 15 and 35% Percoll were collected, diluted in >10-fold volume of wash buffer (0.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tricine, pH 8), and pelleted at 15,000 × g for 1 h. The wash was repeated three times to completely remove the Percoll and any contaminating cytosol. The post-mitochondrial supernatant was spun at 20,000 × g for 10 min and used as the cytosol. In some studies, microsomes were separated from the soluble fraction by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The crude nuclear fraction was enriched further by washing in the homogenization buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, after resuspension and incubation on ice for >30 min. Plastids were partially purified by pelleting through a 10% Percoll cushion and washed three times. Thermolysin Protection Assay—Intact maize mitochondria suspended in 0.4 m mannitol, 50 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 with or without 1% Triton X-100 were incubated in thermolysin (10 μg/mg mitochondrial protein) for 1 h at 25°C. Protease was removed by washing the intact mitochondria three times in the resuspension buffer where CaCl2 was replaced by 1 mm EGTA and protease inhibitors. Mitochondrial pellets were lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and used for protein-blotting analysis. Mitochondria treated with thermolysin in the presence of Triton X-100 were supplemented with EGTA and protease inhibitors at the end of the incubation and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Subfractionation of Mitochondria—Mitochondria were lysed and subfractionated essentially as described by Sweetlove et al. (17Sweetlove L.J. Mowday B. Hebestreit H.F. Leaver C.J. Millar A.H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The effects of sucrose or mannitol were tested by washing the intact mitochondrial pellets in iso-osmotic buffers containing the respective sugars. Carbonate wash of membranes was carried out as described in Roper and Smith (18Roper J.M. Smith A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), except that the washed membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation. Protein Analysis—Protein gel electrophoresis, blotting, and immunological detection were carried out as described previously (9Subbaiah C.C. Sachs M.M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Hardin S.C. Winter H. Huber S.C. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The washed organelle pellets were directly resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the clear supernatants were used for analysis. The soluble fractions were concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and resolubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The protein content was determined by using the Bradford assay (20Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of proteins (5 μg, unless stated otherwise) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Except in two sets of experiments (presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 7) where peroxidase-coupled secondary antisera and the chemiluminescence-based detection system (Pierce) were used, the secondary antisera used in protein-gel blot analysis were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 680 (Molecular Probes) or IRdye 800 (Rockland Immunochemicals). The blots were scanned using the NightOwl CCD camera (Berthold Co.) or a commercial infra-red fluorescence imaging system (ODYSSEY; Li-Cor Biosciences).FIGURE 7Direct interaction between SUS and VDAC. A, total proteins were extracted from root tips and shoots of aerobic (Air) or 12-h anoxic (Anox) maize seedlings as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblot (IB) analysis. The antisera used in the immunoprecipitation reaction were VDAC (maize mitochondrial porin, mAb clone PMO35) and pS15, as indicated at the top of the figure. The additions made to extraction and co-immunoprecipitation buffers are shown at the bottom of the figure. The individual antisera tested in the immunoblot reactions are shown on the left. B, efficiency of VDAC immunoprecipitation by different antisera is shown. Antisera used in IP are identified at the top of the panels. 10 μg of protein from anaerobic seedling tissue extract made in the presence of mannitol and EGTA were tested with 1 μg of anti-pS15 or anti-SUS1 and about 0.1 μg of anti-VDAC antisera. The signal in the SUS1 lane is partly due to the co-migrating immunoglobulin light chain (see text for details).

Mitochondrial import reactions and sample processing were carried out as described in Whelan et al. (21Whelan J. Tanudji M.R. Smith M.K. Day D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation Analysis—SUS-VDAC interactions were detected using co-immunoprecipitation assay as described by Elion (22Elion E.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 4. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 20.5.1-20.5.9Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Purified mitochondria or liquid nitrogen powders of plant material were initially extracted in 2% Triton X-100 to improve the solubilization of membrane proteins. The extracts were later diluted to 0.1–0.2% Triton and pre-cleared by incubating with protein-G-Sepharose for an hour before antibody incubations. Pre-clearing was necessary to remove nonspecific precipitation of VDAC, particularly from freeze-thawed extracts. The effects of sucrose or mannitol (0.1 m) and CaCl2 (1 mm) or EGTA (15 mm) were tested on the immunoprecipitability of SUS or porin by including the reagents in all buffers used. Bioinformatics Analysis—To determine the basis of isoform-specific functional diversity of maize sucrose synthases (9Subbaiah C.C. Sachs M.M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Chourey P.S. Taliercio E.W. Carlson S.J. Ruan Y.-L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), conserved functional domains and predicted structural properties of the three maize sucrose synthases were compared. An outcome of this analysis was the detection of a putative mitochondrial targeting peptide (mTP) at the N terminus of the SH1 protein as predicted by the TargetP program (Table 1) (15Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar). A similar prediction is also made by “Predotar,” another program frequently used to predict the intracellular targeting of plant proteins (16Small I. Peeters N. Legeai F. Lurin C. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). Although plant mTPs are not conserved in their primary sequence, certain structural features have been reported to be essential for targeting the cognate proteins to mitochondria (24Murcha M.W. Rudhe C. Elhafez D. Adams K.L. Daley D.O. Whelan J. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 2134-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Sjöling S. Glazer E. Trends Plant Sci. 1998; 3: 136-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A comparison of the N-terminal sequences of maize SUS proteins indicates that the N terminus of SH1 has features required for targeting proteins to the mitochondria, whereas SUS2 has N-terminal features that are unfavorable for mitochondrial import. Furthermore, the N terminus of SUS1 shows a few features favorable for mitochondrial targeting. The N terminus of SH1 is characterized by a greater abundance of Arg, Ala, Leu, and Ser (52% compared with 36% of SUS1 and SUS2 proteins) and is more basic (pI of 9.38) in its overall charge than SUS1 or SUS2 (pI of 7.93 and 6.3, respectively). The α-helix is the most native-like structure for mitochondrial presequences and is critical for the recognition by the import apparatus (26Wieprecht T. Apostolov O. Beyermann M. Seelig J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15297-15305Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27Zhang X.-P. Glaser E.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13376-13381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Predicted secondary structures indicate that the N terminus of SH1 forms more extensive helical structures (>60%) than those of other two isoforms (30–40%).TABLE 1The output of TargetP program with the complete amino acid sequences of three maize SUS proteins used as the queryNameLengthcTPmTPSPOtherLoc.RCSH18020.0160.8220.0240.405M3SUS18160.0510.5920.0220.6255SUS28090.0720.2230.0200.8552Cutoff0.620.760.000.53 Open table in a new tab Although not yet considered as selection criterion by the targeting programs, the binding of Hsp70 chaperones to organellar transit peptides is important for the translocation of proteins. 97% of plant mTPs have an Hsp70-binding site (27Zhang X.-P. Glaser E. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 14-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Potential Hsp70-binding sites were predicted using a program based on the in vitro affinities of short peptides to the bacterial Hsp70 homolog DnaK (29Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Strong HSP-binding sites are present in the N termini of both SH1 and SUS1, whereas they are distal to the N terminus in SUS2 (data not shown). SUS Association with Mitochondria and Nuclei—To test the mitochondrial localization of SUS, maize seedling extracts were fractionated by differential and Percoll gradient centrifugation. All fractions obtained were tested for the presence of sucrose synthase by protein blotting experiments using a mAb for maize SUS (9Subbaiah C.C. Sachs M.M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). More than 90% of the cellular SUS was recovered as a cytosolic protein. However, SUS-specific signals were also present in purified mitochondria as well as the enriched nuclear fraction (Fig. 1). The nuclear preparation used here was only washed in 0.5% Triton X-100 without further purification. However, our subsequent analyses with purified nuclei consistently showed the presence of SUS in these organelles as well. 3C. C. Subbaiah et al., manuscript in preparation. Alternative oxidase (AOX), as detected by a mAb specific for the mitochondrial protein, was used as a marker for the distribution of mitochondria in these fractions. AOX was present also in a fraction that banded above the 15% Percoll layer (Fig. 1, lane Mix), marking the presence of mitochondria in this thylakoid-rich fraction. However, SUS did not co-localize to this band, indicating that the mitochondria banded here do not contain SUS. We hypothesized that the fraction contains intact but “light” mitochondria and not fragments of “heavy” mitochondria that generally band between 15 and 35% Percoll layers (see below and “Discussion”). We infer from this observation that SUS association is specific to a subpopulation of mitochondria in seedling tissues and may be dependent on the developmental status of the organelles. Mitochondria from germinating seeds of maize have been shown to partition on sucrose density gradients into light and heavy subpopulations, distinct in their ultrastructure, protein composition, and activities. Only the heavy mitochondria showed an active tricarboxylic acid cycle after imbibition and developed further during germination (30Logan D.C. Millar A.H. Sweetlove L.J. Hill S.A. Leaver C.J. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 662-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Similar mitochondrial functional heterogeneity associated with density differences has been reported from other species as well (31Dai H. Lo Y.-H. Jane W.-N. Lee L.-W. Chiang K.-S. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 198-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Isoform-specific Association of SUS with Mitochondria—Of the three SUS paralogs in maize, only the SH1 is predicted to have an mTP at its N terminus (Table 1). We tested whether this in silico prediction is valid in vivo. Isoform-specific antisera, generated against peptide sequences unique to each of the three SUS isoforms in maize (14Duncan K.A. Hardin S.C. Huber S.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) were used to address this question. As shown in Fig. 2, both SH1 and SUS1 were detected in the mitochondrial preparations. In most experiments, we have also used the pS15 peptide antisera (raised against the N terminus of SUS1 containing phosphoserine 15; see Ref. 19Hardin S.C. Winter H. Huber S.C. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These antisera detect mainly the phospho-form of SUS1 with some cross-reactivity against phospho-SH1. Despite lacking a predictable mTP at its N terminus, SUS1 was consistently detected in mitochondrial preparations from all the maize genotypes tested, except in the case of a sus1 mutant (Fig. 2). Although SH1 and SUS1 are known to exist as oligomers in vivo (32Chen Y.C. Chourey P.S. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1989; 78: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the presence of SUS1 in the mitochondria of the deletion mutant (sh1-bz1-x1; see Fig. 2B) indicated that SUS1 can directly associate with mitochondria, independent of its oligomerization with SH1. Some mitochondrial proteins encoded in the nucleus do not carry an mTP at their N termini but have an internal sequence that confers mitochondrial targeting (33Davis A.J. Ryan K.R. Jensen R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 9: 2577-2593Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether SUS1 belongs to this category, we queried successive overlapping fragments of the SUS1 sequence in the TargetP program. A putative internal mTP was identified very close to the N terminus (residues 8–72). Because no other potential mTP is detectable in the downstream sequence, the N-terminal motif may direct the protein to mitochondria. Cytosolic SH1 and SUS1 are heavily phosphorylated at their N termini in vivo. Dephosphorylation of the proteins seems to enhance their hydrophobicity and thereby membrane association (8Winter H. Huber J. Huber S.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Subbaiah C.C. Sachs M.M. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Hardin S.C. Winter H. Huber S.C. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Analysis with pS15 peptide-antisera indicates that mtSUS1 is phosphorylated to a similar proportion as that of the cytosolic form (Fig. 2C), indicating that SUS1 localization in mitochondria may depend on N-terminal phosphorylation and therefore differ mechanistically from its association with microsomes. Although SUS2 was present in the cytosolic fractions of both roots and shoots, this isoform was barely detectable in mitochondria purified from seedling tissues in all genotypes tested, including SUS mutants (Fig. 2, A and B). The sh1 mutant (reference allele) used in Fig. 2A showed anti-SH1 cross-reactive protein in roots and shoots. Nevertheless, the sh1 deletion mutant used in the study (sh1-bz1-x1) had no detectable SH1 protein and also showed a compensatory accumulation of SUS2 in the cytosol. Even in this mutant, SUS2 was absent in mitochondria (Fig. 2B). This observation is in conformity with the lack of an mTP-like sequence either at the N terminus or the distal parts of SUS2 (Table 1; data not shown). Our mutant data further confirmed the isoform specificity of the peptide antisera as originally demonstrated using recombinant proteins (14Duncan K.A. Hardin S.C. Huber S.C. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We probed the mitochondrial preparations for the presence of sucrosephosphate synthase, an enzyme structurally and functionally related to SUS to estimate the extent of cytosolic contamination. As shown in Fig. 2A, sucrose-phosphate synthase was found to be fairly abundant in the cytosolic fractions of the root tips but conspicuously absent from the mitochondria purified from same homogenates. This analysis further validated the differential intracellular distribution of SUS2. Our studies also indicate that the cross-reactivity with the SH1 antisera observed in sh1 mutants varies with the genetic background and appears to be due to a gene redundancy. The anti-SH1 antisera crossreactive protein of ∼90 kDa was observed also in sh1 deletion mutants of di"
https://openalex.org/W2139973477,"During porphyrin biosynthesis the oxygen-independent coproporphyrinogen III oxidase (HemN) catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of the propionate side chains of rings A and B of coproporphyrinogen III to form protoporphyrinogen IX. The enzyme utilizes a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical to initiate the decarboxylation reaction, and it has been proposed that this occurs by stereo-specific abstraction of the pro-S-hydrogen atom at the beta-position of the propionate side chains leading to a substrate radical. Here we provide EPR-spectroscopic evidence for intermediacy of the latter radical by observation of an organic radical EPR signal in reduced HemN upon addition of S-adenosyl-L-methionine and the substrate coproporphyrinogen III. This signal (g(av) = 2.0029) shows a complex pattern of well resolved hyperfine splittings from at least five different hydrogen atoms. The radical was characterized using regiospecifically labeled (deuterium or 15N) coproporphyrinogen III molecules. They had been generated from a multienzyme mixture and served as efficient substrates. Reaction of HemN with coproporphyrinogen III, perdeuterated except for the methyl groups, led to the complete loss of resolved proton hyperfine splittings. Substrates in which the hydrogens at both alpha- and beta-positions, or only at the beta-positions of the propionate side chains, or those of the methylene bridges, were deuterated showed that there is coupling with hydrogens at the alpha-, beta-, and methylene bridge positions. Deuterium or 15N labeling of the pyrrole nitrogens without labeling the side chains only led to a slight sharpening of the radical signal. Together, these observations clearly identified the radical signal as substrate-derived and indicated that, upon abstraction of the pro-S-hydrogen atom at the beta-position of the propionate side chain by the 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical, a comparatively stable delocalized substrate radical intermediate is formed in the absence of electron acceptors. The observed hyperfine constants and g values show that this coproporphyrinogenyl radical is allylic and encompasses carbon atoms 3', 3, and 4."

DNA sliding clamp is a ring-shaped homotrimer that is opened and closed around DNA by the replication factor C (RFC) clamp loader (1Bowman G.D. Goedken E.R. Kazmirski S.L. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 863-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 3Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z.

The PCNA clamp then binds numerous different proteins, including the cellular replicases DNA polymerase δ and DNA polymerase ϵ (5Warbrick E. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The RFC clamp loader was initially identified as a factor required for SV40 DNA replication in vitro (2Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Subsequent characterization of RFC showed it to consist of five different subunits in both yeast and human cells (6Yuzhakov A. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Cell. 1996; 86: 877-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The five subunits are homologous to one another and are members of the AAA+ family of ATPases (7Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structures of yeast RFC and the Escherichia coli clamp loader γ complex reveal that the subunits are arranged in a similar spiral fashion (8Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 9Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To avoid confusion over the different nomenclatures used for the different systems, the positions of the various clamp loader subunits are designated A-E as listed in Table 1. The position of each subunit in the complex is indicated in parentheses with a letter when comparisons are made between systems.TABLE 1Nomenclature and arrangement of clamp loader subunits from different organisms The five subunits of the clamp loader are arranged in a spiral, with each position designated by a letter. Open table in a new tab The yeast Rfc1(A) subunit (human p140(A)) is sometimes referred to as the large subunit, as it contains both N- and C-terminal extensions past its region of homology with the four small subunits. The other four RFC subunits, referred to as the small subunits, are in the 36-40-kDa range: yeast Rfc2(D) (human p37), yeast Rfc3(C) (human p36), yeast Rfc4(B) (human p40), and yeast Rfc5(E) (human p38). The N-terminal region of Rfc1, up to the region of homology to the other RFC subunits, can be deleted in both yeast and human RFC without decreasing RFC clamp loader function with PCNA (10Gomes X.V.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Alternative clamp loaders exist in which Rfc1 is replaced by another protein. An example of one such alternative clamp loader is the Rad·RFC DNA damage checkpoint clamp loader, in which Rad24(A) (Rad17 in humans) replaces Rfc1(A) and loads the 911 heterotrimer clamp onto DNA (12Parrilla-Castellar E.R. Arlander S.J. Karnitz L. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). RFC shares striking structural and functional similarity with the E. coli clamp loader γ complex (1Bowman G.D. Goedken E.R. Kazmirski S.L. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J.

Cell. 2001; 8: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Both RFC and the E. coli γ complex require the binding of ATP or ATPγS to induce a conformational change that allows interaction with the clamp and subsequent ring opening (15Naktinis V. Onrust R. Fang L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13358-13365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nature of this conformational change is unclear, but ATP binding is sufficient, and hydrolysis is not needed. The γ complex consists of five clamp loader subunits, three γ, one δ, and one δ′, each of which are composed of three domains (9Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Two small subunits of the γ complex, χ and Ψ, are not required for the clamp-loading operation. The first two N-terminal domains of the γ, δ, and δ′ subunits consist of the AAA+ region of homology. The crystal structure reveals that the C-terminal domain of each subunit mediates oligomerization into a spiral heteropentamer and that a gap exists between the AAA+ regions of the δ(A) and δ′(E) subunits (9Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The δ subunit binds β tightly and can open the β clamp by itself (20Turner J. Hingorani M.M. Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 771-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the δ “wrench” bound to β reveals that β binds the N-terminal AAA+ domain of the δ subunit (21Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Superposition of δ·β onto γ3δδ′ indicates that β likely docks onto the AAA+ domains of all five clamp loader subunits (9Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The structure of RFC in complex with PCNA and ATPγS shows that the RFC subunits have a similar domain arrangement and circular architecture to the γ complex (8Bowman G.D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Nature. 2004; 429: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). RFC retains the pronounced gap between the AAA+ domains of the Rfc1(A) and Rfc5(E) subunits, which correspond spatially to the δ(A) and δ′(E) subunits in the γ complex. This gap serves the purpose of allowing DNA to enter the central chamber in the clamp loader and thereby positions DNA into the opened clamp docked underneath the clamp loader. The C-terminal extension of Rfc1 is positioned within a portion of this gap. Rfc1(A) is located in the position analogous to the δ(A) wrench in γ3δδ′. However, the RFC·PCNA·ATPγS structure reveals a closed PCNA ring despite interaction with Rfc1. This closed conformation of PCNA may possibly be due to specific mutations that were made in RFC to prevent nucleotide hydrolysis during crystal growth. The Rfc3 and Rfc4 subunits also bind PCNA. Due to the spiral structure of RFC in complex with a flat planar PCNA ring, each adjacent RFC subunit is poised further away from the PCNA ring. Thus, in going around the RFC pentamer, Rfc1(A) forms the most extensive contact with PCNA; Rfc4(B) is positioned over an interface and contacts PCNA in a minimal fashion; then Rfc3(C) binds the second protomer of PCNA, but buries less surface area than the Rfc1-PCNA contact; and finally, Rfc2(D) and Rfc5(E) are suspended above PCNA and do not bind the ring at all. Like Rfc4, Rfc2 is positioned above a PCNA interface. Rfc5 is positioned above the remaining hydrophobic site in the third PCNA protomer. The PCNA ring is closed in the RFC·PCNA·ATPγS structure (9Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), yet ATPγS enables the RFC·PCNA complex to bind DNA and therefore presumably promotes PCNA opening (17Lee S.H. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5672-5676Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 18Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that Rfc1 normally opens PCNA but that the ring is closed in the structure due to mutations that were made to prevent ATPγS hydrolysis during crystal growth. Alternatively, Rfc5 and/or Rfc2 must bind PCNA for the clamp to open, consistent with their lack of contact with PCNA in the structure. In this study, we examined RFC subunits for the ability to open PCNA, which was observed experimentally by the unloading of PCNA from circular DNA. This work demonstrates that Rfc1 is not required for PCNA opening. In fact, the Rfc2·3·4·5 subcomplex of the four small RFC subunits can open PCNA clamps and clear them from DNA. This study further demonstrates that Rfc2 and Rfc5 bind directly to PCNA and that Rfc5 is required for PCNA opening by RFC. In fact, an Rfc2·5 subcomplex can open and unload PCNA from DNA. Rfc5(E) is positioned opposite the PCNA interface from Rfc1(A), and therefore, its action with Rfc2 in opening PCNA indicates that the PCNA clamp is opened from the opposite side of the interface that the E. coli δ wrench acts upon. These internal workings mark a significant departure in the underlying mechanism of clamp opening by eukaryotic and prokaryotic clamp openers. Radioactive nucleotides were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DNA modification enzymes were from New England Biolabs, and DNA oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies. RFC concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein stain and bovine serum albumin as a standard. PCNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 6420 m-1 cm-1.

The 3′-end of this primer contains an 18-nucleotide EBNA1-binding sequence that hybridizes to the complementary sequence on the M13EBNA1 template. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFC genes were cloned into the pET11a (Novagen), pLANT2/RIL (24Finkelstein J. Antony E. Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), or pCDFduet (Novagen) vector. The plasmids containing single genes include pET11a-RFC1, pET11a-RFC2, pLANT2/RIL-RFC2, pET11a-RFC3, pET11a-RFC4, and pET11a-RFC5. The expression plasmids containing two or more genes include pET11a-RFC3+4, pLANT2/RIL-RFC1+5, and pET11a-RFC2+3+4. Mutations were introduced into the RFC2, RFC3, and RFC4 genes using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). Arg101, Arg107, and Arg175 of Rfc2 (RFC2(DNA-bind mut)); Arg88, Arg94, and Lys152 of Rfc3 (RFC3(DNA-bind mut)); and Arg84, Arg90, and Lys149 of Rfc4 (RFC4(DNA-bind mut)) were all mutated to alanine.

The open reading frames of the mutated genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. To construct pET-RFC(2DNA-bind mut+3DNA-bind mut+4DNA-bind mut), plasmids pET11a-RFC4(DNA-bind mut) and pET11a-RFC(3DNA-bind mut+4) were digested with SacI/AflI. The fragment containing RFC4(DNA-bind mut) was ligated into the fragment containing pET11a-RFC3(DNA-bind mut) to yield pET11a-RFC(3DNA-bind mut+4DNA-bind mut). In addition, pET11a-RFC2(DNA-bind mut) was digested with BglII/HindIII and blunt-filled with Klenow fragment; the small fragment was gel-purified and ligated into pET-RFC(3SAC+4SAC) (which was cut with SphI, blunted with Klenow fragment, and treated with alkaline phosphatase; the large fragment was gel purified). The screen for orientation showed that RFC2 was facing in the opposite orientation from RFC3 and RFC4. Finally, both pET-RFC(3DNA-bind mut+4DNA-bind mut) and pET-RFC(2DNA-bind mut+3SAC+4SAC) were digested with MluI/SgrAI; the large fragment from the former and the small fragment from the latter were ligated together to form pET-RFC(2DNA-bind mut+3DNA-bind mut+ 4DNA-bind mut). RCF(ΔRfc1 AAA+)—Rfc1 lacking the N-terminal ligase region has four remaining domains. The AAA+ region of homology is contained in the first two domains (domains 1 and 2), and domain 3 interacts with the other RFC subunits to form the pentameric collar; domain 4 is a C-terminal extension that is positioned within the gap between Rfc1 and Rfc5 in the crystal structure (9Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Domain 3 of Rfc1 (Leu549-Thr667) was isolated from pET11a-RFC1 by PCR using the following primers: 5′-ggg aaa aga atc ata tgc taa aac cct ttg aca ttg ccc-3′ and 5′-ccg gat cct cat gtg aaa ttg att ctt ccc gcc atg tgg ccg gca act ttt gat gc-3′. This fragment, lacking domains 1, 2, and 4 (i.e. ΔRfc1 AAA+), was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pCDFduet vector to make pCDF-duet-ΔRFC1 AAA+. The open reading frame was confirmed by DNA sequencing. RCF(ΔRfc5 AAA+)—Rfc5(domain 3), which interacts with the other subunits to form the collar of pentameric contacts, corresponds to Pro257-Asp354. The vector for expression of this domain was generated using the same protocol as described above, except that the template DNA used was pET-RFC5. The PCR primers were 5′-ccc tat aca tat gcc aga ttg gat tat agt gat cca taa att aac gag g-3′ and 5′-g cgt taa gga tcc gct ttt tgt gtg act tat ac-3′. The DNA fragment encoding Rfc5 Pro257-Asp354 was then cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pCDFduet to yield pCDFduet-ΔRFC5 AAA+.

This fragment was then cloned into HK-pET (gene reference) at the NdeI and BamHI sites to produce HK-pET-RFC5(domain 1). Cotransformation reactions utilizing pET-, pLANT/RIL-, and pCD-Fduet-derived RFC subunit expression plasmids were performed using the BL21(DE3) Star strain of E. coli competent cells (Invitrogen). Transformants were selected on LB plates containing ampicillin (100 mg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and streptomycin (50 mg/ml). Fresh transformants were grown in 12-24 liters of Terrific broth containing the appropriate antibiotics at 30 °C until cell growth reached A600 = 0.6. Cultures were then brought to 15 °C by chilling on ice before addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by incubation at 15 °C for ∼18 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. For purification of the RFC DNA-binding mutant, the five-subunit RFC containing DNA-binding mutations in Rfc2-4 was expressed by cotransformation of pLANT2/RIL-RFC1+5 and pET11a-RFC(2DNA-bind mut+3DNA-bind mut+4DNA-bind mut). Cells harvested from 12 liters of culture were resuspended in 300 ml of Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and then lysed using a French press at 22,000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation and applied to a 100-ml SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with a 1-liter gradient of 150–600 mm NaCl in Buffer A. Column fractions were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue. The peak of RFC (which eluted at ∼480 mm NaCl) was pooled and diluted with Buffer B to ∼150 mm NaCl. Protein was then applied to a 20-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer B containing 90 mm NaCl and eluted with a 200-ml gradient of 90-500 mm NaCl in Buffer B. Fractions containing the RFC complex (which eluted at ∼300 mm NaCl) were stored at -80 °C. The final yield was ∼40 mg of purified RFC DNA-binding mutant/12 liters of culture. RFC(ΔRfc1 AAA+) containing truncated Rfc1 (domain 3 only) was expressed by cotransformation of pLANT2/RIL-RFC5, pET11a-RFC2+3+4, and pCDFduet-ΔRFC1 AAA+. Purification of the RFC mutant followed the same procedure as described for the RFC DNA-binding mutant, except that a 100-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column was used with a 1-liter gradient of 90-500 mm NaCl in Buffer B. The final yield was ∼49 mg of purified RFC(ΔRfc1 AAA+)/12 liters of culture. Expression of RFC containing truncated Rfc5 (domain 3 only) was performed by cotransformation of pLANT2/RIL-RFC1, pET11a-RFC2+3+4, and pCDFduet-ΔRFC5 AAA+. The RFC mutant was purified following the same procedure as described above, except that a 100-ml gradient of 90-500 mm NaCl in Buffer B was used to elute protein from a 20-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column. The final yield was 22 mg of RFC(ΔRfc5 AAA+)/12 liters of culture. HK-pET-RFC5(domain 1) was transformed and expressed in BL21-(DE3) Star competent cells. The cell pellet harvested from 12 liters of culture was resuspended in 180 ml of Buffer C. After lysis using a French press and clarification by centrifugation, the supernatant from the crude lysate was diluted with Buffer D to a conductivity equal to 150 mm NaCl. At this conductivity, the Rfc5(domain 1) protein flowed through both an SP-Sepharose and a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column. The protein was then precipitated using 70% ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 60 ml of Buffer E. The protein was dialyzed against Buffer E containing 500 mm NaCl and then applied to a 10-ml nickel-charged chelating Sepharose column and eluted using a 100-ml gradient of 5-1000 mm imidazole in Buffer E. Column fractions were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, and fractions containing Rfc5(domain 1) were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer B. Protein was loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q column and eluted using a 20-ml gradient of 25-500 mm NaCl in Buffer B. Contaminants bound to this column, but Rfc5(domain 1) flowed through. The final yield was ∼10 mg of Rfc5(domain 1)/12 liters of culture. Wild-type RFC with either full-length Rfc1 or Rfc1 lacking the N-terminal ligase domain (referred to here as RFC1ΔN) was purified as described (25Yao N. Coryell L. Zhang D. Georgescu R.E.

Rfc2, Rfc3·4, and Rfc2·5 were also purified as described (25Yao N. Coryell L. Zhang D. Georgescu R.E. Finkelstein J. Coman M.M. Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50744-50753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The four-subunit Rfc2·3·4·5 complex was reconstituted by mixing equimolar Rfc2·5 and Rfc3·4, followed by incubation at 16 °C for 10 min. The alternative clamp loader Rad·RFC was expressed by cotransformation of pLANT2/RIL-Rad24+RFC5 and pET11a-RFC2+3+4. Cells harvested from 12 liters of culture were resuspended in 175 ml of Buffer A containing 800 mm NaCl and then lysed using a French press at 22,000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation and diluted with Buffer A until the conductivity was ∼200 microsiemens/cm and the volume was 500 ml. The lysate was then applied to a 125-ml SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The column was eluted with a 1-liter gradient of 150-600 mm NaCl in Buffer A. Column fractions were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Blue. The peak of Rad·RFC (which eluted at ∼300 mm NaCl) was pooled and diluted with Buffer A to ∼200 mm NaCl. Protein was then applied to a 50-ml Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated with Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and eluted with a 500-ml gradient of 150-600 mm NaCl in Buffer A. Fractions containing the Rad·RFC complex were stored at -80 °C. The final yield was ∼120 mg of purified Rad·RFC/12 liters of culture. Rfc5(domain 1) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using carbodiimide chemistry in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.5) to yield a final value of ∼4000 response units of immobilized Rfc5(domain 1). 1 μm protein kinase-tagged PCNA in surface plasmon resonance buffer containing 8 mm MgCl2 was passed over immobilized Rfc5(domain 1) at a flow rate of 6 μl/min for 5 min, after which buffer lacking protein was injected over the chip. This protocol was repeated using immobilized Rfc2 protein (13,700 response units immobilized). A six-residue N-terminal kinase recognition motif was cloned into S. cerevisiae PCNA, allowing it to be radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using the recombinant catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (26Yao N. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1421-1432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 27Kelman Z. Naktinis V. O'Donnell M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 430-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 32P-PCNA (≈20-60 cpm/fmol) was first loaded onto either singly nicked plasmid or singly primed single-stranded M13 DNA (as indicated in the figure legends). Reactions contained either 4 pmol of gpII-nicked pBluescript or 2.8 pmol of singly primed single-stranded M13 DNA (coated with ∼757 pmol of E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein as tetramer), 10 pmol of 32P-PCNA, and 2 pmol of RFC1ΔN in 200 μl of clamp loading buffer containing 2 mm ATP and 8 mm MgCl2. After 20 min at 30 °C, the 32P-PCNA·DNA complex was purified from free 32P-PCNA by gel filtration on 5-ml Bio-Gel A-1.5m columns (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with gel filtration buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. 180-μl fractions were collected. Excluded peak fractions, 13-17, were combined and then divided into four tubes (210 μl each). Each tube was incubated for 5 min at 30 °C with 2 mm ATP in the presence or absence of wild-type or mutant RFC (exact amounts are given in the figure legends). The linear range of the assay extends to 70% of clamps unloaded. Therefore, initial experiments were performed to determine the concentration range of wild-type and mutant RFC and subcomplexes that fall within the linear range for the experiments presented. Reactions were then examined for 32P-PCNA clamp loading by gel filtration on a second 5-ml Bio-Gel A-1.5m column equilibrated with gel filtration buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, and 180-μl fractions were collected. Aliquots (150 μl) were analyzed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The molar amount of 32P-PCNA in each fraction was calculated from the known specific activity of radioactive PCNA. RFC binding to DNA was measured using a fluorescent primed DNA template. The fluorescent 30-mer oligonucleotide primer contained a Rhodamine Red-X fluorophore group (Integrated DNA Technologies) linked to the 3′-OH by a six-carbon spacer. The primed DNA template was prepared by annealing 1.0 nmol of 3′-Rhodamine Red-X-conjugated 30-mer with 1.2 nmol of unlabeled 66-mer in 100 μl of 5 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 15 mm sodium citrate (final pH 8.5) as described above for unlabeled templates. RFC complexes were titrated from 0 to 120 nm into 60-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 125 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 0.04 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 μm ATPγS, and 10 nm rhodamine-labeled primer·template. The fluorophore was excited at 570 nm, and emission was monitored over 580-680 nm. The relative intensity of the peak at 588 nm was plotted versus RFC concentration. The apparent Kd for wild-type RFC binding to DNA was determined using the model A + B ↔ AB and the curve-fitting software KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Clamp Unloading as a Means for Measuring PCNA Opening—One of the primary steps in RFC assembly of PCNA on DNA is the opening of the clamp. Clamp loaders (both prokaryotic and eukaryotic) can also unload clamps from DNA (3Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J.

Functional characterization of these actin mutants has been limited by the lack of a high level expression system for human cardiac actin. Here, wild-type (WT) human α-cardiac actin and a mutant E99K actin have been expressed and purified from the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Glu-99 in subdomain 1 of actin is thought to interact with a positively charged cluster located in the lower 50-kDa domain of the myosin motor domain. Actin-activated ATPase measurements using the expressed actins and β-cardiac myosin showed that the mutation increased the Km for actin 4-fold (4.7 ± 0.7 μm for WT versus 19.1 ± 3.0 μm for the mutant), whereas the Vmax values were similar. The mutation slightly decreased the affinity of actin for S1 in the absence of nucleotide, which can partly be accounted for by a slower rate of association. The in vitro motility for the E99K mutant was consistently lower than WT over a range of ionic strengths, which is likely related to the lower average force supported by the mutant actin. The thermal stability of the E99K was comparable to that of WT-actin, implying no folding defects. The lower density of negative charge in subdomain 1 of actin therefore weakens the actomyosin interaction sufficiently to decrease the force and motion generating capacity of E99K actin, thus providing the primary insult that ultimately leads to the disease phenotype.

The majority of heritable cardiac conditions are either hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) 2The abbreviations used are: HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; cS1, cardiac subfragment 1; Tm, melting temperature; WT, wild-type; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MES, 4-morpholineethane-sulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; cS1, cardiac subfragment 1; Tm, melting temperature; WT, wild-type; DTT, dithiothreitol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MES, 4-morpholineethane-sulfonic acid. or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). HCM, a frequent cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes, is characterized by an increase in the ventricular mass (hypertrophy) of the heart muscle, whereas DCM is typified by thinning of the ventricular wall. HCM is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, and molecular genetic studies show that there are over 200 missense point mutations in eight different sarcomeric contractile protein genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Seidman J.G. Seidman C. Cell. 2001; 104: 557-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar).To date there are nine recognized actin mutations implicated in cardiomyopathies. Seven are associated with HCM (E99K, P164A, Y166C, A230V, A295S, M305L, and A331P) (2Mogensen J. Klausen I.C. Pedersen A.K. Egeblad H. Bross P. Kruse T.A. Gregersen N. Hansen P.S. Baandrup U.

Science. 1998; 280: 750-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Patients carrying these actin mutations display a phenotype ranging from severe cardiac disease to being asymptomatic. The conserved nature of the amino acid sequence of actin suggests that mutated residues will likely affect basic actin functions, including actomyosin interactions, actin-actin interactions involved in polymerization, interactions with the Z line, or the binding of regulatory proteins. The current study focuses on the HCM actin mutation E99K, which is located in a surface loop in subdomain 1 of actin (Fig. 1A). Individuals with this HCM mutation manifest with a later onset of the disease, and they display a variable degree of hypertrophy (4Olson T.M. Doan T.P. Kishimoto N.Y. Whitby F.G. Ackerman M.J. Fananapazir L. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1687-1694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).During the cross-bridge cycle, myosin makes contact with actin at several interfaces in a multistep process. The initial weak interaction is mainly ionic in nature and transitions into stronger binding using hydrophobic contacts. Each myosin head interacts with two adjacent actin monomers along the F-actin helix. The primary binding site is with subdomain 1 of the upper actin monomer, whereas the secondary binding site occurs with subdomain 1 of the actin monomer below. Glu-99 is believed to be part of this secondary binding site, which is also ionic in nature (Fig. 1, B and C). It is one of three acidic residues (Glu-93, Glu-99, and Glu-100), which are thought to interact with a positively charged loop in the lower 50-kDa domain of the myosin motor domain (7Milligan R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 8Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A.

A charge reversion such as that occurring in the E99K mutant is likely to have an impact on actomyosin interactions.To ultimately understand the functional effects that actin mutations have in cardiac disease, it is critical to have an expression system capable of producing mutant actins in quantities abundant and pure enough to allow investigation of its primary defect at the molecular level. Attempts to express actin in Escherichia coli resulted in insoluble aggregates due to the lack of the required cytosolic chaperonin containing TCP-1 in prokaryotes (10Frankel S. Condeelis J. Leinwand L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17980-17987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, reviewed in Ref. 11Dunn A.Y. Melville M.W. Frydman J. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mutated cardiac actin can be synthesized in cell-free coupled transcription/translation systems (12Vang S. Corydon T.J.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 2037-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but only picogram quantities of protein are expressed, making it difficult to obtain the necessary biochemical and biophysical information. Yeast is a viable expression system (reviewed in Ref. 13Ayscough K.R. Drubin D.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 129-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but yeast actin shares only 87% identity with human α-cardiac actin, making it less than ideal to study human disease. Likewise, Dictyostelium discoideum and Drosophila can be used to express actin, but the functional consequences of mutations implicated in human disease need to be investigated in the correct isoform.Our laboratory has succeeded in expressing actin in high yields in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system (14Joel P.B. Fagnant P.M. Trybus K.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11554-11559Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we cloned and expressed human α-cardiac actin (WT) and the charge reversal mutant E99K implicated in HCM, in the baculovirus expression system. Our results suggest that the primary defects of E99K actin are slower motility, reduced average force, and a weakened interaction with cardiac myosin in the presence of ATP. These deficits at the molecular level appear to be sufficient to trigger the disease phenotype.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—The Drosophila 5C actin gene (generous gift from Loy Volkman) was used as a template to produce the coding sequence of wild-type human α-cardiac actin (WT) by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting gene was cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pAcUW51 (BD Biosciences) behind the p10 promoter. An HCM actin mutant (E99K) was made using WT as the template. Both constructs were fully sequenced to verify mutagenesis and the absence of PCR-induced errors. The numbering system corresponds to that of human α-cardiac muscle actin.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Actin—Recombinant baculovirus encoding for WT and E99K were prepared using established protocols (15O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors, A Laboratory Manual. 1992; (W. H. Freeman, New York)Google Scholar). Infected Sf9 cells in suspension were harvested at 72 h and lysed in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 m KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 4% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml Tween 20, 0.5 mm Na2ATP, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, 5 mm benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. The cell lysate was clarified and dialyzed overnight into 15 mm MOPS, pH 7, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.25 mm Na2ATP, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysate (150 ml from a preparation of 3 billion cells) was incubated with 60 ml of SP-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h. The flow through was collected and dialyzed into G buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 8.26, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.25 mm Na2ATP, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and fractionated on a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column (60-ml bed volume, 1.5- × 50-cm column). The recombinant actin was eluted with a 0.1 m NaCl to 0.4 m NaCl linear gradient in G buffer. Fractions were pooled, dialyzed back into G buffer, and concentrated with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp.). The actin was polymerized overnight on ice by addition of 0.1 m KCl and 2 mm MgCl2 and spun at 328,000 × g for 2 h. The pellet was resuspended in actin storage buffer (5 mm NaCl, 10 mm Imidazole, pH 7, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT). Concentration was determined from at 290 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.63 ml mg–1 cm–1. Typical yield was ∼3 mg of protein/billion cells. Actin that was not used immediately (within 5 days) was dialyzed back into G buffer for 3 days and stored in liquid nitrogen after adding 2 mg of sucrose/mg of G-actin.Purification of Other Proteins—Rabbit β-cardiac myosin was prepared from frozen rabbit hearts with atria removed (Pel Freez Biologicals) following the method described for skeletal muscle myosin (16Margossian S.S. Lowey S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (17Malmqvist U.P. Aronshtam A. Lowey S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15058-15065Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The purified myosin was stored at –20 °C in 50% glycerol for up to 6 months. This myosin was used to prepare cardiac S1 (cS1) by chymotryptic cleavage as described (18Waller G.S. Ouyang G. Swafford J. Vibert P. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15348-15352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Tissue-purified chicken skeletal actin was used in many assays as a control due to its availability and similarity to cardiac actin. Skeletal actin was prepared from chicken pectoralis acetone powder as described (19Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar).Gels and Immunoblots—Proteins were separated on a 4–12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) run in MES buffer (per NuPAGE technical guide). Immunoblots were incubated with either monoclonal anti-α-sarcomeric actin (Sigma clone 5C5, 1:500 dilution) or monoclonal anti-β-cytoplasmic actin (Sigma clone AC-15, 1:1000 dilution). The secondary antibody was anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase, and detection was achieved by using a 3,3′-diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate tablet set (Sigma).Actin-activated ATPase—The actin-activated ATPase activity of β-cardiac rabbit myosin (137 μg/ml) was determined at 30 °C using various concentrations of the two recombinant actins (WT and E99K) in 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm DTT. The assay was initiated by the addition of 2 mm MgATP and stopped with SDS at six time points every 10 min for 1 h. The inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically. Details were described previously (20Trybus K.M. Methods. 2000; 22: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For β-cardiac rabbit S1 (30 μg/ml), the buffer conditions were 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm DTT at 30 °C. The lower salt concentration was needed to keep the Km values as low as possible.Rigor Binding Affinity—Pyrene-labeled chicken skeletal actin was prepared as described (20Trybus K.M. Methods. 2000; 22: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and stored in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm DTT. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The competing and pyrene-labeled actins were stabilized by the addition of equimolar phalloidin for 24 h before use. Nucleotide stocks were prepared with equimolar amounts of magnesium. Pyrene-actoS1 (15 nm pyrene-labeled actin, various concentrations of the unlabeled competing actin, and 250 nm cS1) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.2 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm DTT was mixed with 6 μm MgATP at 20 °C using a Kin-Tek stopped flow spectrophotometer. 100 nm cS1 was used in similar experiments containing 0.1 m KCl. Pyrene actin fluorescence was excited at 360 ± 10 nm, and emission was detected with a 400-nm cutoff filter. All transients are the average of at least five to eight independent mixings.Data were fitted to a competitive binding curve essentially as described before (21Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The y-axis value was not fixed when fitting the curve but allowed to float. The Kd of cS1 for the pyrene-labeled actin was set at 12 nm in 100 mm KCl, and 200 nm in 200 mm KCl, based on independent direct binding assays. Pyrene actin concentration was 15 nm, and cS1 concentration was 100 nm at 100 mm KCl and 250 nm at 200 mm KCl.Rates of Binding to Actin—Binding of actin to cS1 was measured in the presence or absence of ADP. Various actin concentrations in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 25–100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm DTT, ± 1 mm ADP was mixed with 0.5 μm cS1. For 90° light scattering, the exciting beam was 294 ± 10 nm and the emission was detected with a 294 nm interference filter. At least five to eight transients were averaged before being fitted to an exponential using Kin-Tek software.In Vitro Motility Assay—Actin filament velocity was measured at 30 °C in motility buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, 0–100 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm MgATP, 2.9 mg/ml glucose, 0.125 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma), and 0.023 mg/ml catalase (Sigma)) (20Trybus K.M. Methods. 2000; 22: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). If used, methylcellulose was 0.5% or 0.7%. Cardiac myosin was applied to nitrocellulose-coated flow cells at 66 μg/ml. In early assays 200 μg/ml cardiac myosin was combined with equimolar actin and 1 mm MgATP and centrifuged for 20 min at 350,000 × g to remove myosin that was unable to dissociate from actin in the presence of ATP. Myosin was adhered to the nitrocellulose-coated flow cell, and the surface was blocked with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. An actin/ATP wash was then performed by adding 1 μm vortexed actin (to create small filaments) for 30 s, followed by a 1 mm MgATP wash, to remove any remaining rigor heads. In later motility assays, the cardiac myosin was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (17Malmqvist U.P. Aronshtam A. Lowey S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15058-15065Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) immediately preceding the assay, and the actin/ATP wash was eliminated. The velocities of at least 55 filaments and up to as many as 250 filaments were averaged to obtain the mean ± S.D. Data were analyzed using the program described previously (22Work S.S. Warshaw D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Average Force Assay—Isometric force was measured by in vitro motility by adding α-actinin in varying amounts to create an internal load on the actin until velocity was stopped. The assay was performed as described (17Malmqvist U.P. Aronshtam A. Lowey S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15058-15065Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) at 30 °C, using motility buffer containing 50 mm KCl and 0.5% methylcellulose. In all cases, cardiac myosin was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography immediately before the assay was performed. Myosin was infused in the nitrocellulose flow cells and allowed to incubate for 1 min, followed by three washes with motility buffer containing no ATP or methylcellulose. Varying concentrations of α-actinin were then added for 1 min, followed by blocking with three washes of rigor motility buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Fluorescently labeled actin was added twice for 30 s each. Rigor motility buffer was added twice, followed by two washes of motility buffer with ATP and methylcellulose.Thermal Denaturation—DNase-I inhibition was performed as described (23Blikstad I. Markey F. Carlsson L. Persson T. Lindberg U. Cell. 1978; 15: 935-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Briefly, actin was heated and held at increasing temperatures (1 °C/min) in a Mastercycler gradient 5331 (Eppendorf). The actin samples were removed from the heat at specific temperature points (25–65 °C) and placed on ice until all samples were collected. The actin samples were mixed with salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) and held at 25 °C for at least 5 min. Final actin concentration in the assay was 1.2 μm, and DNA was 40 μg/ml (100 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 4 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm NaN3). Immediately before following the absorbance change, 0.6 μg/ml DNase-I (from bovine pancreas, Grade I, Roche Applied Science) was added to the actin-DNA mixture in the cuvette. The optical density at 260 nm was followed continuously for 1 min at 25 °C using a Hitachi U-2001 spectrophotometer. The slopes were determined at each time point. Percent inhibition was determined using the formula [1 – (slope at a given temperature/average slope at 65 °C)] × 100. The melting temperature (Tm) was determined as the 50% point between 25 °C (100% inhibition of DNase-I and 0° slope) and 65 °C (0% inhibition and the maximum slope).RESULTSExpression of Human α-Cardiac Actin—Wild-type (WT) and a mutant (E99K) human α-cardiac actin were expressed in Sf9 cells. Actin was clearly the predominant protein expressed by the infected Sf9 cells. Following purification by ion exchange chromatography and a functional polymerization step, the expressed actin showed no major contaminants (Fig. 2). Yields of purified protein were similar for the WT and mutant actins (∼3 mg/billion Sf9 cells). Western blotting with antibodies specific for mammalian skeletal or cardiac muscle actins (Sigma clone 5C5) recognized both recombinant cardiac actins but not endogenous Sf9 cell actin. Western blotting with a monoclonal antibody specific to β-cytoplasmic actin (Sigma clone AC-15) showed a small carryover of endogenous Sf9 cell actin (data not shown). Negatively stained images of the expressed actins showed normal filament morphology and no evidence of bundling (data not shown), as had been reported for the Dictyostelium E99H/E100H actin mutant (24Johara M. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishijima A. Kojima H. Yanagida T. Sutoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2127-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Preparation of expressed actin.

Human and avian skeletal actin are identical, whereas cardiac and skeletal actin differ at only four positions (D2E, E3D, L299M, and S358T).The E99K Mutation Increases the Km for Cardiac Myosin—The steady-state actin-activated ATPase activity of β-cardiac myosin as a function of increasing actin concentrations was determined for WT and E99K actins at 50 mm NaCl (Fig. 3A). The Km for actin was 4-fold higher for E99K actin than for WT-actin, while the Vmax values were similar (Table 1). Data obtained with tissue purified actin was indistinguishable from expressed WT-actin (data not shown). Thus, one consequence of the charge reversal mutation is a large increase in the Km of cardiac myosin for actin, without an appreciable change in the maximum actomyosin ATPase activity.FIGURE 3Steady-state actin-activated ATPase. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was measured for WT-actin and E99K actin. Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. A, β-cardiac rabbit myosin was used in conjunction with four independent preparations of expressed WT (○) or E99K (•) actin. Both actins had a similar Vmax. E99K actin showed a 4-fold higher Km for cardiac myosin compared with the WT-actin. See Table 1 for values. Conditions: 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm DTT at 30 °C. B, the assay was repeated using β-cardiac rabbit S1 and expressed WT (○) or E99K (•) actin. Both actins had a similar Vmax. In addition, both actins showed a similar affinity for cardiac S1. See Table 1 for values. Conditions: 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaN3, and 1 mm DTT at 30 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TABLE 1Actin activated ATPase activityActinCardiac myosinCardiac S1VmaxKmVmaxKms-1μms-1μmWT0.81 ± 0.044.7 ± 0.74.4 ± 0.223.3 ± 3.3E99K0.98 ± 0.0921.6 ± 3.74.6 ± 0.429.6 ± 5.9 Open table in a new tab Actin-activated ATPases were also performed with cardiac S1 at 5 mm NaCl (Fig. 3B). Similar to the experiments described above with cardiac myosin, the Vmax values for WT-actin and E99K were similar (Table 1). Note that the Vmax values obtained with cS1 are ∼4-fold higher than obtained with whole myosin, a characteristic typical of chymotryptic S1 from striated muscle myosins. In contrast to the data obtained with myosin, both actins showed a similar Km value (Table 1). As a control, the same actin preparation used for the S1 assays still showed a large difference in Km when full-length myosin was used. Pelletting assays with cS1 and the two actins in the presence of ATP also revealed no differences in affinity (data not shown). Possible explanations for the differences between the S1 and myosin results are addressed under “Discussion.”Affinity of S1 for Actin in the Absence of Nucleotide Is Affected by the Point Mutation—A competitive binding assay was used to assess the affinity of cardiac S1 for the mutant E99K, WT, and tissue-purified actins in the absence of nucleotide (21Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). cS1 and pyrene-labeled tissue-purified actin were incubated with increasing concentrations of unlabeled competing actins (WT, E99K, or tissue-purified). The actomyosin mixture was dissociated in the stopped flow by mixing with MgATP (Fig. 4A). The amplitude of the pyrene signal decreased as the concentration of the unlabeled competing actin increased, consistent with greater competition of unlabeled actin for cS1. The amplitude of the signal was plotted as a function of competing unlabeled actin concentration (Fig. 4B). When the data were fitted to a competitive binding equation to derive the Kd values (21Kurzawa S.E. Geeves M.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1996; 17: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), E99K actin showed only a slightly decreased affinity for cS1 compared with WT-actin (Table 2).FIGURE 4Equilibrium binding in the absence of nucleotide. A, transients obtained when pyrene-labeled actoS1, containing various concentrations of unlabeled actin, was dissociated by 6 μm MgATP. The increase in fluorescence as a function of time (jagged trace) was fitted to a single exponential (smooth line). B, the amplitude of the fluorescence change was plotted as a function of the concentration of E99K (•), WT (○), and the tissue-purified (▵) actin. Fitting the data to a competitive binding curve (see “Experimental Procedures”) gave the Kd values reported in Table 2.

The rate of association of cS1 to E99K actin, both in the presence of ADP and in rigor, was ∼60% of that observed with WT-actin (Table 3). Because the change in the equilibrium binding constant in rigor was smaller than the observed change in the association rate, the dissociation rate constant must also be affected by the mutation.TABLE 3Binding rates for the various actinsConditionsE99KWTTissue-purifiedμm-1 s-1ADP, 25 mm KCl1.92 (n = 2)2.95 (n = 2)3.75 (n = 3)Rigor, 100 mm KCl1.40 (n = 2)2.58 (n = 2)2.83 (n = 3) Open table in a new tab Cardiac Myosin Moves E99K Actin at Slower Velocities Than WT-actin—The effect of the mutation on the motor properties of actomyosin was assessed by the in vitro motility assay. All the actin filaments in the field (WT, E99K, and tissue-purified) were moved by β-cardiac myosin. The mutant E99K showed a reduced velocity of between 13 and 21% relative to WT and tissue-purified actin in the presence of methylcellulose, over a range of KCl concentrations (Fig. 5A). The difference between E99K and either the WT or tissue-purified actins was statistically different (p < 0.01) at all KCl concentrations but was most pronounced at 100 mm. There was no statistical difference between WT and tissue-purified actin. The lower velocity of the E99K actin was not due to sub-saturating myosin concentrations, because the velocity at which the mutant actin moved remained the same from 50 to 200 μg/ml myosin (50 mm KCl).FIGURE 5In vitro motility assay.

There was a statistical difference (p < 0.01) between E99K and both WT and tissue-purified actins at all KCl concentrations. There was no statistical difference between tissue-purified and WT-actins.

https://openalex.org/W1989810757,"We previously showed that the EP2 knockout mice were resistant to chemically induced skin carcinogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of the overexpression of the EP2 receptor in mouse skin carcinogenesis. To determine the effect of overexpression of EP2, we used EP2 transgenic (TG) mice and wild-type (WT) mice in a DMBA (7,12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene)/TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) two-stage carcinogenesis protocol. EP2 TG mice developed significantly more tumors compared with WT mice. Overexpression of the EP2 receptor increased TPA-induced keratinocyte proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the epidermis of EP2 TG mice 48 h after topical TPA treatment was significantly thicker compared to that of WT mice. EP2 TG mice showed significantly increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels in the epidermis after prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) treatment. The inflammatory response to TPA was increased in EP2 TG mice, as demonstrated by an increased number of macrophages in the dermis. Tumors and 7 × TPA-treated and DMBA-TPA-treated (6 weeks) skins from EP2 TG mice produced more blood vessels than those of WT mice as determined by CD-31 immunostaining. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expression was significantly increased in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) samples from EP2 TG mice compared that of WT mice. There was, however, no difference in the number of apoptotic cells in tumors from WT and EP2 TG mice. Together, our results suggest that the overexpression of the EP2 receptor plays a significant role in the protumorigenic action of PGE2 in mouse skin."

Prompted by this, we examined whether the other two putative DNA-binding members of this family, hSnm1A and hSnm1B, may associate with telomeres. hSnm1A was found to not interact with the telomere. Conversely, hSnm1B was found to associate with telomeres in vivo by both immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the C terminus of hSnm1B was shown to interact with the TRF homology domain of TRF2 indicating that hSnm1B is likely recruited to the telomere via interaction with the double-stranded telomere-binding protein TRF2.

The ends of human chromosomes are capped and protected by a DNA-protein structure termed the telomere. The DNA portion of human telomeres is composed of a G-rich repeat (TTAGGG) that extends past the complementary C-rich strand, forming a 3′ extension. This extension has been found by electron microscopy to loop back and invade the double-stranded region, forming a large loop structure termed the t-loop (1Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). The protein portion of telomeres is composed of a core of six proteins termed the telosome or shelterin (2Wright J.H. Gottschling D.E. Zakian V.A. Genes.

Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), whereas hPot1 binds the single-stranded region of the telomere (8Baumann P. Cech T.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In addition to this core complex, many other proteins are known to associate and function at the telomere, albeit at a smaller concentration and often indirectly through binding to TRF1 or TRF2 (4de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). One protein that influences the stability of the telomere but is not a member of the described core telomeric complex is Artemis. This protein is a member of the β-CASP family of proteins that contain a unique metallo-β-lactamase domain that hydrolyzes nucleic acids (14Aravind L. In Silico Biol. 1999; 1: 69-91PubMed Google Scholar). Artemis is well established to play a role in non-homologous recombination where it forms a complex with DNA-PKCS, which cleaves the intermediate hairpin loop structure formed during V(D)J recombination and non-homologous end joining (15Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). However, Artemis-deficient mice have increased telomeric fusions, suggesting that this family of proteins plays a role in telomere structure or function (16Rooney S. Alt F.W. Lombard D. Whitlow S. Eckersdorff M. Fleming J. Fugmann S. Ferguson D.O. Schatz D.G. Sekiguchi J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Indeed, Artemis deficient cell lines have increased rates of telomeric shortening as well as rapid accumulation of anaphase bridges (17Cabuy E. Newton C. Joksic G. Woodbine L. Koller B. Jeggo P.A. Slijepcevic P. Radiat. Res. 2005; 164: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Five mammalian proteins belonging to the β-CASP family have been identified, two of which hydrolyze RNA (18Christofori G. Keller W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2272-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), whereas the remaining three, Artemis, Snm1A, and Snm1B, are believed to function solely on DNA substrates (22Callebaut I. Moshous D. Mornon J.P. de Villartay J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3592-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Snm1A localizes to DNA double-strand breaks after ionizing radiation; although cells lacking Snm1A are sensitive only to mitomycin C and not ionizing radiation (23Richie C.T. Peterson C. Lu T.

Hoeijmakers J.H. Kanaar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4553-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Snm1A co-localizes with the DNA damage response protein 53BP before and after exposure to ionizing radiation (23Richie C.T. Peterson C. Lu T. Hittelman W.N. Carpenter P.B. Legerski R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8635-8647Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Snm1A is also highly up-regulated during mitosis and is believed to function as a checkpoint protein during early mitosis (25Zhang X. Richie C. Legerski R.J.

Snm1B is the least well understood of the DNA-binding β-CASP family members. Knock-out of Snm1B in chicken cells and small interfering RNA against Snm1B in human cells both result in mild sensitivity to interstrand cross-linking agents (28Ishiai M. Kimura M. Namikoshi K. Yamazoe M. Yamamoto K. Arakawa H. Agematsu K. Matsushita N. Takeda S. Buerstedde J.M. Takata M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10733-10741Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 29Demuth I.

Plasmids—hSnm1A was PCR-amplified from plasmid clone (ATCC clone 7286032) to include a 5′-FLAG epitope sequence and subcloned into pBabePuro. YFP was PCR amplified from pEYFP-C3 (Clontech) and subcloned in frame at the N terminus of FLAG-hSnm1A to generate YFP-FLAG-hSnm1A. The sequence of hSnm1A was verified by DNA sequencing. hSnm1B was obtained by reverse transcriptase PCR amplification of dT-primed 293T RNA and subcloned in frame into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). The sequence of hSnm1B was verified by DNA sequencing. hSnm1B or truncation mutants that result in fragments from amino acids 413–532, 463–532, 496–532, and 363–495 were generated by PCR and subcloned in frame with GFP lacking a stop codon, generating pBabePuro-GFP-hSnm1B or mutants thereof. pcDNA3-myc-TRF2 was a kind gift from Dominique Broccoli. The following truncation mutants of TRF2 were generated by PCR (numbers refer to the corresponding amino acid region amplified), N-terminally tagged with myc by cloning into pCMV-myc (Clontech): TRF2-(2–100), TRF2-(101–200), TRF2-(301–400), TRF2-(401–500), TRF2-(2–300), and TRF2-(269–445).

After 48 h, 293T cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. To visualize TRF2, 293T cells were then permeabilized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 1× PBS and incubated with the anti-human TRF2 monoclonal antibody (Imgenex IMG-124A) at 1:5000 dilution. The primary antibody was detected with the rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The cells were then washed twice with PBS, mounted, and observed using the 100× objective lens on an Olympus IX70 confocal microscope.

The lysate was then transferred to new tubes and immunoprecipitated overnight with 4 μg of anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Diagnostics). Finally, dot blots were hybridized with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide telomeric probe (T2AG3)4 in Church's buffer overnight at 50 °C followed by two washes with 4× SSC containing 0.1% SDS. After 5 days of phosphoimaging the blots were then stripped and probed with an α satellite probe (derived from plasmid p82H) (31Mitchell A.R. Gosden J.R. Miller D.A. Chromosoma. 1985; 92: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) in Church's buffer overnight at 60 °C followed by two washes with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Hybridization of the probes was confirmed with 10 μg of total genomic DNA blotted on each membrane. Immuoprecipitations—293T cells were seeded in 6-cm tissue culture dishes and transfected with 3 μg of plasmid. Nuclear lysates were collected 48 h later and immunoprecipitated overnight with 4 μg of anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Roche Diagnostics). Bound proteins were then collected on GammaBind G-Sepharose, washed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and denatured by boiling in SDS sample buffer. The proteins were then separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibody. Anti-myc antibody (Invitrogen) was used to detect myc-TRF2 and myc-TRF2 truncation mutants.

However, Artemis is only one of three putative DNA-binding proteins containing β-lactamase domains, the remaining two being hSnm1A and hSnm1B (22Callebaut I. Moshous D. Mornon J.P. de Villartay J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3592-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). hSnm1A and hSnm1B have also been found to localize to discrete punctate nuclear bodies (28Ishiai M. Kimura M. Namikoshi K. Yamazoe M. Yamamoto K. Arakawa H. Agematsu K. Matsushita N. Takeda S. Buerstedde J.M. Takata M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10733-10741Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), reminiscent of punctate nuclear localization seen with telomeric proteins (7Broccoli D. Smogorzewska A. Chong L. de Lange T. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether hSnm1A or hSnm1B localized to the telomere. To examine whether these proteins associate with telomeres in human cells, we assayed whether ectopic hSnm1A or hSnm1B co-localize with the known double-stranded telomeric-binding protein TRF2. Specifically, human 293T cells were transfected with either FLAG-hSnm1A or hSnm1B N-terminally tagged with YFP or GFP, respectively, for visualization purposes. The localization of these fluorescent proteins was then compared with that of endogenous TRF2, as measured by immunofluorescence. As reported previously, both YFP-FLAG-hSnm1A and GFP-hSnm1B localized to discrete punctate nuclear bodies (28Ishiai M. Kimura M. Namikoshi K. Yamazoe M. Yamamoto K. Arakawa H. Agematsu K. Matsushita N. Takeda S. Buerstedde J.M. Takata M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 10733-10741Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, only GFP-hSnm1B co-localized with endogenous TRF2 at the telomere (Fig. 1). These data support the notion that hSnm1B associates with telomeres. To independently confirm the localization of hSnm1B to telomeres, we tested whether hSnm1B associates with telomeric chromatin in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation. GFP-hSnm1B was transiently expressed in 293T cells for 48 h, and cells were cross-linked, lysed, the chromatin sheared, and the tagged protein immunoprecipitated with GFP antibody. To detect associated telomeric DNA, DNA was purified from the immunoprecipitate, blotted on a membrane, and hybridized with a telomeric probe to determine specific protein-telomere interactions. As a control for nonspecific association with telomeric DNA, GFP and YFP-FLAG-hSnm1A, both of which are not found to be associated with telomeric DNA by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1 and data not shown) were similarly expressed in 293T cells and analyzed for association with telomeric DNA in parallel with GFP-hSnm1B. We also stripped and rehybridized the membranes with a centromeric probe to control for nonspecific protein-DNA interactions. Finally, to ensure that interactions with telomeric DNA were specific, non-cross-linked controls were also subject to chromatin immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A). We found that hSnm1B co-immunoprecipitated specifically with telomeric DNA (Fig. 2, A and B), as a strong signal was detected when hSnm1B immunoprecipitates were hybridized with a telomeric probe but not the centromeric probe (Fig. 2, A and C), and only background signal was detected with the telomeric probe in the absence of crosslinking. Similarly, immunoprecipitates from control GFP and YFP-FLAG-hSnm1A gave background signals with both the telomeric and centromeric probes (Fig. 2, A–C). We thus conclude that hSnm1B associates with telomeres in vivo. The C Terminus of hSnm1B Binds TRF2—Given that the immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that hSnm1B associates with telomeres in vivo, we sought to determine how hSnm1B is tethered to telomeres. We explored the possibility that hSnm1B localizes to the telomere via protein-protein interaction. Since TRF1, TRF2, and hPot1 are the core proteins directly associating with telomeric DNA, and these proteins are known to serve as a scaffold for proteins to telomeres (4de Lange T. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2100-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar), we first tested whether they associate with hSnm1B. 293T cells were transiently transfected with GFP-hSnm1B, immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody, and blotted with an anti-TRF1, TRF2, or hPot1 antibody to detect for an association with endogenous TRF1, TRF2, or hPot1, respectively. Of these, only TRF2 appeared to co-immunoprecipitate with hSnm1B (Fig. 3A and data not shown). This interaction was specific to hSnm1B, as transiently expressed YFP-FLAG-hSnm1A did not co-immunoprecipitate with TRF2 (Fig. 3C). To further explore the association of TRF2 with hSnm1B, we mapped the TRF2-binding domain on hSnm1B. We focused on the C terminus of hSnm1B, as this region is not conserved with hSnm1A, which does not associate with telomeres. Three progressively larger N-terminal truncation mutants of hSnm1B (413–532, 463–532, 496–532) were generated and N-terminally tagged with GFP (Fig. 3B), transiently expressed in 293T cells, after which the mutant proteins were immunoprecipitated with GFP monoclonal antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-TRF2 antibody to detect endogenous TRF2 (Fig. 3C). All three progressively shorter C-terminal fragments co-immunoprecipitated with TRF2, including GFP-hSnm1B-(496–532), the polypeptide encompassing the last 37 amino acids of the protein. This suggests that the most terminal amino acids are responsible for the TRF2 interaction. In agreement, a mutant lacking these C-terminal 37 amino acids, GFP-hSnm1B-(363–495), was not capable of binding TRF2. We next tested whether the TRF2-binding region of hSnm1B was required for telomere association in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Specifically, the GFP-hSnm1B-(363–495) was transiently expressed in 293T cells, immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody, and associated telomeric DNA detected by hybridization with a telomeric probe. Unlike full-length hSnm1B, the TRF2-binding mutant did not co-immunoprecipitate with telomeric DNA (Fig. 2). Based on these in vitro and in vivo experiments, we conclude that hSnm1B is localized to telomeres via an interaction with TRF2. hSnm1B Interacts with the TRFH Domain of TRF2—Because TRF2 is known to interact with a number of telomere-binding proteins, we were interested in determining what domain of TRF2 was required for the interaction with hSnm1B. A panel of N-terminal myc-tagged TRF2 truncation mutants were generated (Fig. 4A) and assayed for association with hSnm1B. Specifically, 293T cells were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant myc-TRF2 and GFP-hSnm1B, after which hSnm1B was immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-myc antibody to detect associated ectopic TRF2. Only full-length TRF2 and a truncation mutant corresponding to the first 300 amino acids of TRF2, myc-TRF2-(2–300), were able to interact with GFP-hSnm1B (Fig. 4B). This mutant encompasses both the N-terminal basic domain of TRF2 as well as the TRF2 homology domain, which is essential for dimerization and for known protein-protein interactions (32Fairall L. Chapman L. Moss H. de Lange T. Rhodes D. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The basic domain is not sufficient for interaction with GFP-hSnm1B, as a mutant containing the entire domain, myc-TRF2-(2–100), is unable to be immunoprecipitated with GFP-hSnm1B (Fig. 4B). Thus, the TRF homology domain of TRF2 is most important for interacting with hSnm1B. Interestingly, far more hSnm1B was immunoprecipitated when TRF2 or the hSnm1B-binding domain of TRF2 was overexpressed (Fig. 4B), perhaps suggesting that binding of TRF2 either increases the stability of hSnm1B or produces a conformational change within hSnm1B that fosters immunoprecipitation. We have shown that hSnm1B is a novel telomere-associated protein. In addition, we have shown that hSnm1B co-immunoprecipitates with the double-stranded telomere-binding protein TRF2. This interaction occurs via a TRF2 interaction domain on the C terminus of hSnm1B. We speculate that hSnm1B is recruited to the telomere via the interaction with TRF2, although we have not yet determined whether this interaction is direct or indirect. What hSnm1B does at the telomere can only be speculated at this point. On one hand, since Artemis can cleave single-stranded DNA loop structures (15Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), it is possible that hSnm1B may play a role in processing the telomeric t-loop structure. Alternatively, as the budding yeast SNM1 possesses 5′-exonuclease activity in vitro (33Li X. Moses R.E. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 34Li X. Hejna J. Moses R.E. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), perhaps hSnm1B generates the single-stranded 3′ overhang at the end of the telomere. Nevertheless, the association of hSnm1B with telomeres argues that this protein is likely performing some function critical to telomere structure or function.

https://openalex.org/W2035294058,"Neo-angiogenesis is a complex phenomenon modulated by the concerted action of several molecular factors. We have generated a congenic line of knockout mice carrying null mutations of both placental growth factor (PlGF) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), two genes that play a pivotal role in the regulation of pathological angiogenesis. In the present study, we describe the phenotype of this new experimental animal model after surgically induced hind-limb ischemia. Plgf-/-, eNos-/-, Plgf-/- eNos-/-, and wild-type C57BL/6J mice were studied. Plgf-/- eNos-/- mice showed the most severe phenotype: self-amputation, and death occurred in up to 47% of the animals studied; in ischemic legs, capillary density was severely reduced; macrophage infiltration and oxidative stress increased as compared to the other groups of animals. These changes were associated with an up-regulation of both inducible NOS (iNOS) expression and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein levels in ischemic limbs, and to an increased extent of protein nitration. Our results demonstrate that the deletion of these two genes, Plgf, which acts in synergism with VEGF, and eNos, a downstream mediator of VEGF, determines a significant change in the vascular response to an ischemic stimulus and that oxidative stress within the ischemic tissue represents a crucial factor to maintain tissue homeostasis."

Strong evidence indicates that NPM is required for embryonic development and genomic stability. Here we report that NPM enhances the proliferative potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and increases their survival upon stress challenge. Both short term liquid culture and clonogenic progenitor cell assays show a selective expansion of NPM-overexpressing HSCs. Interestingly, HSCs infected with NPM retrovirus show significantly reduced commitment to myeloid differentiation compared with vector-transduced cells, and majority of the NPM-overexpressing cells remains primitive during a 5-day culture. Bone marrow transplantation experiments demonstrate that NPM promotes the self-renewal of long term repopulating HSCs while attenuated their commitment to myeloid differentiation. NPM overexpression induces rapid entry of HSCs into the cell cycle and suppresses the expression of several negative cell cycle regulators that are associated with G1-to-S transition. NPM knockdown elevates expression of these negative regulators and exacerbates stress-induced cell cycle arrest. Finally, overexpression of NPM promotes the survival and recovery of HSCs and progenitors after exposure to DNA damage, oxidative stress, and hematopoietic injury both in vivo and in vitro. DNA repair kinetics study suggests that NPM has a role in reducing the susceptibility of chromosomal DNA to damage rather than promoting DNA damage repair.

Conversely, NPM expression is down-regulated in cells undergoing differentiation or apoptosis (6Patterson S.D. Grossman J.S. D'Andrea P. Latter G.I. J. Biol.

Most recently, studies with Npm-deficient mice have shown that loss of NPM impairs embryonic development and leads to premature cellular senescence and genomic instability (16Grisendi S. Bernardi R.

More recently, we have shown that NPM acts as a cellular p53 negative regulator to protect cells from stress-induced apoptosis (19Li J. Zhang X. Sejas D.P. Bagby G.C. Pang Q. J. Biol.

Although these findings are consistent with the notion that NPM modulates stress-induced apoptosis, the influence of NPM on cellular proliferation and apoptosis in the context of hematopoiesis remains unknown. Here we show that NPM regulates differentiation, cell cycle progression, and stress response in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice—WT and Fancc–/– mice were generated by interbreeding the heterozygous Fancc+/– mice (a generous gift from Dr. Manuel Buchwald, University of Toronto; Ref. 21Chen M.

Genet. 1996; 12: 448-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). The genetic background of the mice is C57BL/6. All of the mice were used at ∼8–10 weeks of age. All experimental procedures conducted in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.Isolation of BM LSK Cells—BM mononuclear cells were depleted of lineage-committed cells using the magnetic-activated cell separation (MACS) cell separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.). Lin-ScaI+c-kit+ (LSK) cells were then purified by staining the Lin– cells with Sca-1-PE and c-kit-APC antibodies (BD PharMingen) followed by cell sorting using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson).Construction of Retroviral Expression Vectors—The full-length human NPM cDNA (GenBank™ sequence accession number BC009623) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the following primers: 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCACCATGGAAGATTCGATGGACATG and 5′-GTCCTAGAAAGAGACTTCCTCCACTG. The resulting PCR fragments were subcloned into the NotI and XbaI sites of p3×FLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma) to create p3×FLAG-CMV-14-NPM. The FLAG-tagged NPM fragments was then removed and subcloned into the retroviral vector MIEG3 (a gift from Dr. Yi Zheng, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center) to create MIEG3-NPM. The MIEG3 and MIEG3-NPM plasmids (10μg each) were used to produce retroviral supernatant.Retroviral Production and Infection—The MIEG3 and MIEG3-NPM retroviruses were prepared by Dr. van der Loo at the Viral Vector Core, Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH. Retroviral supernatant was collected at 36, 48, and 60 h, respectively, after transfection. Lin– or LSK cells were plated onto Retronectin-coated (Takara-Shuzo) non-tissue culture 24-well plates and prestimulated for 2 days in IMDM medium containing 20% fetal calf serum, 100 ng/ml stem cell factor (SCF), 20 ng/ml interleukin-6 (IL-6), and 50 ng/ml Flt-3 ligand (Flt-3L) (Peprotech). Cells were then exposed to the retroviral supernatant at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2–5 for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). Cells were centrifuged at 600 × g for 45 min. Infection was repeated two times and infection efficiency was assessed by the detection of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).Clonogenic Progenitor Assays—The transduced cells were cultured at 1000 cells/ml in a 35-mm tissue culture dish in 4 ml of semisolid medium containing 3 ml of MethoCult M 3134 (Stem Cell Technologies) and the following growth factors: 100 ng/ml SCF, 10 ng/ml rhIL-3, 100 ng/ml granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and 4 units/ml erythropoietin (Peprotech). On day 10 after plating, the colony number was counted and photographed. Colony growth results were expressed as mean (of triplicate plates) ± S.D. colonies per 1000 cells plated. Levels of significance were determined using Student's t distribution.Single Cell Analysis—Single LSK GFP+ cells were sorted and deposited into each well of 96-well plates and cultured in 15 μl of IMDM medium containing cytokines. The presence of a single cell in individual wells was verified, and wells with no cell or more than one cell were excluded from analysis. Cell division was monitored at 24-h intervals for at least 4 days.Apoptosis Assay and Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were stained with annexin V and propidium iodide using BD ApoAlert Annexin V kit (BD PharMingen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptosis was analyzed by quantification of annexin V positive cell population by flow cytometry. For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed by 0.25% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized with 0.3% Nonidet P-40, and then stained with propidium iodide containing 1 mg/ml RNase A, followed by FACS analysis of the G0/G1, S, and G2/M populations.Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts (100 μg of total proteins) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were incubated with the antibodies specific for cyclins A, B, or E, cdc2 (Oncogene Research Products), Cdk2, 4, or 6, NPM (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), p53, p21 (Cell Signaling Technology), or β-actin (Sigma) for 12–16 h at 4 °C.Immunocytochemistry—Cells were cytospun onto slides and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 5 min in –20 °C. After air drying, cells were blocked for 1 h with 5% normal serum. Then cells were incubated with primary antibodies (p53 or p21, both from Cell Signaling Technology) in phosphate-buffered saline with 2% normal serum at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washes, cells were incubated with PE-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). DNA was then labeled with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Sigma). Slides were finally mounted in mounting medium (Vector). Cells were viewed and photographed using a Leica DM IRB microscope at ×10 magnification with an ORCA-ER C4742–95 camera (Hamamatsu). The captured images were processed using OpenLab 3.1 software (Improvision) and displayed with Adobe Photoshop V6.0.RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was prepared with RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's procedure. Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamers and Superscript II RT (Invitrogen) and was carried out at 42 °C for 60 min and stopped at 95 °C for 5 min. These reactions were followed by PCR using two primers specific for the respective NPM and 3×FLAG sequences: 5′-TCCGCTGCAGACAGACTGGCCAG-3′ (sense; within NPM sequence) and 5′-CATCGCGCACATCCAGCCGAGC-3′ (antisense; within 3×FLAG sequence), with thermal cycling parameters: 95 °C for 5 min; 15, 20, or 30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min.Short and Long Term Competitive Repopulating Analysis—Age-matched female congenic B6.SJL-PtrcaPep3b/BoyJ (B6.BoyJ; CD45.1+) mice (Jackson Laboratories) were used as transplant recipients. These mice were lethally irradiated (9.5 Gy, 110 cGy/min, 137Cs γ-rays) and injected intravenously with 1 × 105 Lin-BM cells transduced with MIEG3 or MIEG3-NPM viruses, mixed with 5 × 105 competitor cells. Donor-derived repopulation in recipients was assessed by the proportion of leukocytes in peripheral blood that expressed the GFP protein by flow cytometry. Short and long term engraftment and multilineage repopulation analysis of donor cells were performed at 1 month and 4 month post-transplantation. For secondary BM transplantation, BM cells from all individual recipients were pooled and then 5 × 104, 2 × 105, and 2 × 106 bone marrow cells were injected into cohorts of eight female lethally irradiated recipients per cell dose. Recipients were analyzed at 4 and 16 weeks post-transplant. For transplants using LKS+ cells, recipient mice received 1,000 freshly isolated cells and were analyzed at 1, 4, and 6 month intervals.Comet Assay—The generation of DNA strand breaks was assessed by the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay (22Tice R.R. Agurell E. Anderson D. Burlinson B. Hartmann A. Kobayashi H. Miyamae Y. Rojas E. Ryu J.C. Sasaki Y.F. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 2000; 35: 206-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar), using a Fpg-FLARE (fragment length analysis using repair enzymes) comet assay kit in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Trevigen). For each experimental point at least three different cultures were analyzed, and 50 cells were evaluated from each culture. Comet tail length and tail moment were measured under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon model 027012) using an automated image analysis system based on a public domain NIH Image program (23Helma C. Uhl M. Mutat. Res. 2000; 466: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Hematopoietic Stress Treatment of Transplanted Mice—Two weeks after transplantation, recipients were injected intraperitoneal with a single dose of 5-fluorouuracil (5-FU; Sigma; 150 mg/kg). GFP-positive donor-derived cells were counted weekly post-injection. Peripheral blood leukocytes were analyzed for myeloid (Gr-1/CD11b) and lymphoid (B220/CD3) reconstitution.Statistics—Data were analyzed statistically using a two-tail Student's t test. The level of statistical significance stated in the text was based on the p values. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSNPM Promotes HSC and Progenitor Cell Expansion—To gain insight into the role of NPM in hematopoiesis, we overexpressed FLAG-tagged NPM in murine BM LSK cells by retroviral gene transfer (Fig. 1A). We purified GFP-positive cells by FACS and confirmed the expression of the NPM transgene by RT-PCR using primers complementary to the NPM and FLAG-coding sequences (Fig. 1B). We generally achieved transduction efficiency of greater than 50% (Fig. 1C). We cultured vector- and NPM-transduced LSK cells for 10 days and analyzed cell proliferative potential. As shown in Fig. 2A, NPM-transduced cells expanded significantly faster than vector-transduced cells during 4 days of culture (4.2- and 6.4-fold at days 3 and 4, respectively, compared with 1.7- and 2.3-fold with vector-transduced cells). Notably, we observed that the growth rate of NPM-transduced cells peaked at days 5 and 6. Further analysis indicated a modest increase in cell death (Fig. 2B) and erythroid lineage (Ter119+) differentiation in these cells (Table 1). Thus, a modest decline in proliferation of the NPM-transduced cells might be caused by an increase in terminal differentiation, which could lead to an increase in cell death. Indeed. We found that NPM expression increased erythroid reconstitution in our bone marrow transplantation experiments (see Fig. 4, below). We next determined whether NPM confers growth advantage to HSC and progenitor cells. During the 10-day period, the content of GFP+ cells in vector group (cells transduced with vector alone) remained steady at ∼50% (Fig. 2C), which was close to initial transduction efficiency of 52%. Significantly, NPM-transduced cells (54% transduction efficiency) exhibited a significant growth advantage to total cells, with more than 80% of the cells expressed eGFP/NPM at day 10 (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 2NPM promotes HSC/progenitor cell growth.

We found that total number of colonies formed by NPM-transduced cells was more than 2-fold higher than that of vector-transduced cells (Fig. 2D). Significantly increased series-plating efficiency was also observed with NPM-transduced LSK cells compared with vector-transduced cells (Fig. 2E). In addition, NPM-expressing LSK cells generally formed larger colonies than vector-transduced cells did (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate a selective expansion of NPM-overexpressing HSC and progenitor cells.NPM Overexpression Decreases Differentiation of Myeloid-committed Progenitors—Given that NPM overexpression promotes HSC expansion, we wondered if NPM affected differentiation of these primitive cells. Interestingly, NPM expression decreased the differentiation of LSK cells toward myeloid lineage, with a 3-fold decrease in cell population expressing myeloid marker Gr-1 and CD11b (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, more than 50% of NPM-expressing cells retained expression of primitive marker ScaI and c-Kit compared with 20% of vector-transduced cells (Fig. 3C). Consistent with this, NPM-expressing cells showed loss of granulocyte maturation and accumulation of myeloblasts and early progenitors (mostly promyelocytes) at day 10 of culture (Fig. 3D). In contrast, myeloid differentiation in vector-transduced cells seemed to be morphologically normal, as evidenced by mature neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages (Fig. 3D). These results indicate a selective expansion of NPM-expressing HSC and progenitor cells.FIGURE 3Overexpression of NPM decreases the differentiation potential of myeloid-committed progenitors.

Significantly, NPM-transduced cells constituted more than 40% of the peripheral blood cells at 16 weeks after transplantation, compared with less than 10% reconstitution by vector-transduced cells (Fig. 4B). Examination of lineage distribution of GFP+ and GFP– cells in the peripheral blood cells from the 16-week post-transplanted mice shows that 10% of the cells were Gr-1/CD11b+, 30% were either B220+ or CD3e+, and 16% were Ter119+, indicating that HSCs expressing NPM has the ability of multilineage reconstitution. However, the percentage of myeloid (Gr-1/CD11b+) cells was significantly reduced in NPM/GFP+ fraction compared with that reconstituted by non-transduced cells (Fig. 4, C and D). This is in agreement with the in vitro data (Fig. 3) showing that NPM inhibits myeloid differentiation. Interestingly, NPM expression increased proportion of erythroid (Ter119+) cells (16% compared with 6% in vector/GFP+ fraction; p < 0.05; Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that NPM may be a positive regulator of erythropoiesis. Similar results were obtained with secondary transplantation, which shows that NPM promoted the self-renewal of long term repopulating HSCs while attenuated their commitment to myeloid differentiation (Table 2).TABLE 2Secondary transplantationVirusChimerismAll WBCsMyeloidLymphoidErythroid%Vector3 ± 0.216 ± 3.212 ± 2.615 ± 5.7NPM10 ± 1.6aStatistical significance between vector and NPM samples at p < 0.05.6 ± 0.8aStatistical significance between vector and NPM samples at p < 0.05.12 ± 3.525 ± 4.3aStatistical significance between vector and NPM samples at p < 0.05.a Statistical significance between vector and NPM samples at p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab NPM Is a Positive Regulator of HSC Cell Cycle Progression—To address how NPM expression enhances HSC and progenitor cell expansion, we analyzed cell cycle profile of NPM-transduced LSK cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, NPM overexpression prominently reduced cells in the G0/G1 phase (55.6% compared with 65.4% with vector-transduced cells). This coincided with a significant increase in cells in the S phase (34% compared with 26.1% with vector-transduced cells). BrdU labeling experiments show that the percentage of cells entering the cell cycle was significantly higher in NPM-transduced cells than in vector-transduced cells (45% compared with 30%; Fig. 5B). To further determine the cellular mechanism by which NPM promotes HSC and progenitor cell expansion, we employed a single-cell assay to see if overexpression of NPM regulates the recruitment of HSCs into the cell cycle in response to cytokine stimulation. At 24 h, about 20% of NPM-transduced LSK cells underwent at least one division compared with ∼12% of vector-transduced cells (p < 0.05; Fig. 5C). Less dramatic but still significant (p < 0.05) result was obtained with the pair of cell lines at 48 h when nearly 70% of NPM-transduced cells have undergone division compared with 56% of vector-transduced cells (Fig. 5D).FIGURE 5NPM promotes G1 to S transition. A, cell cycle analysis of vector and NPM transduced LSK cells. B, transduced LSK cells were pulsed with BrdU, and percentage of cells incorporated with BrdU was determined by staining the cells with FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody. C and D, NPM overexpression promotes HSC cell division. Single LSK cell was sorted into 96-well plates and the cumulative percentage of cells that have undergone at least one cell division after 24 h (C) and 48 h (D) were calculated.

The circulatory system then provides a means of transporting tumor cells to distant sites where they extravasate and establish metastatic lesions. This study utilizes activity-based protein profiling to compare the active serine hydrolase repertoire in high intravasating (HT-hi/diss) and low intravasating (HT-lo/diss) variants of the human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cell line to determine which enzyme(s) play a role in intravasation. Activity-based protein profiling revealed multiple serine hydrolases with altered activity between HT-hi/diss and HT-lo/diss cells, with the largest difference being the activity of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Levels of inactive uPA zymogen were similar between the two cell variants, but only HT-hi/diss conditioned medium contained active uPA, suggesting that uPA activation may contribute to the enhanced intravasation of HT-hi/diss cells. To analyze the role of uPA activity specifically in the process of intravasation, we grafted cells from the two HT-1080 variants onto the chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryos and measured levels of tumor cell intravasation in the distal chorioallantoic membrane using quantitative human-specific Alu PCR. Inhibition of uPA activity with natural (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) or synthetic (amiloride) inhibitors diminished HT-hi/diss Matrigel invasion in vitro and intravasation and metastasis in vivo. Additionally, treatment of HT-lo/diss tumors with exogenous active uPA increased the number of intravasated cells in vivo. These results indicate that active uPA promotes tumor cell intravasation and that uPA activation appears to be a key step in tumor progression."

Comparison of functional properties of purified α1/His10-β1 and α1/His10-β1/PLM complexes show that PLM lowered K0.5 for Na+ ions moderately (≈30%) but did not affect the turnover rate or Km of ATP for activating Na+,K+-ATPase activity. PLM also stabilized the α1/His10-β1 complex. In addition, PLM markedly (>3-fold) reduced the K0.5 of Na+ ions for activating Na+-ATPase activity. In membranes co-expressing α1/His10-β1 with PLM the K0.5 of Na+ ions was also reduced, compared with the control, excluding the possibility that detergent or lipid in purified complexes compromise functional interactions. When expressed in HeLa cells with rat α1, rat PLM significantly raised the K0.5 of Na+ ions, whereas for a chimeric molecule consisting of transmembranes segments of PLM and extramembrane segments of FXYD4, the K0.5 of Na+ ions was significantly reduced, compared with the control.

We discuss the role of PLM in regulation of Na+,K+-ATPase in cardiac or skeletal muscle cells. The Na+,K+-ATPase actively transports Na+ and K+ ions across cell membranes, thus maintaining the normal transmembrane gradients of Na+ and K+ ions. As could be expected, Na+,K+-ATPase is closely regulated at several levels. A unique mode of regulation of the Na+,K+-ATPase has been described recently, involving interactions between the α/β complex and the FXYD proteins (1Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. News Physiol.

The FXYD proteins are not required for basic pump function, but they act as accessory subunits to the α- and β-subunits, and modulate the kinetic properties in a tissue-specific fashion.

Res. 2004; 29: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), in regard to its physiological role in cardiac contraction, more attention has been paid recently to the functional interaction of PLM with Na+,K+-ATPase. After co-expression in Xenopus oocytes together with rat α-isoforms, PLM was co-immunoprecipitated with either α1 or α2 and α3, and co-immunoprecipitation with either α1 or α2 was also seen for native rat heart sarcolemma, albeit more weakly with α2 (26Crambert G. Fuzesi M. Garty H. Karlish S. Geering K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In Xenopus oocytes The PLM induced an almost 2-fold decrease in apparent affinity for cytoplasmic Na+, a small decrease in apparent affinity for extracellular K+, and little or no effect on the maximal pump current or on ouabain binding. As mentioned above, PLM has been detected in bovine choroid plexus membranes, and an anti-PLM antibody reduces Vmax without affecting the apparent Na+ affinity (16Feschenko M.S. Donnet C. Wetzel R.K. Asinovski N.K. Jones L.R. Sweadner K.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2161-2169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result does not necessarily contradict the findings with Xenopus oocytes because the antibody can neutralize interactions only at the C terminus of PLM, whereas the effect on apparent Na+ affinity may be mediated by other segments of PLM. However, a recent study using sarcolemma membrane obtained from hearts of PLM knock-out mice showed a lower Vmax of Na+,K+-ATPase, even after taking into account a ∼20% lower expression of the α-subunit, but again, no difference in apparent Na+ affinity (27Jia L.G. Donnet C. Bogaev R.C. Blatt R.J. McKinney C.E. Day K.H. Berr S.S. Jones L.R. Moorman J.R. Sweadner K.J. Tucker A.L. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 288: H1982-H1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The implication is that PLM stimulates Na+,K+-ATPase activity, with no change in Na+ affinity. This does not fit well with the observations in Xenopus oocytes. There is some evidence that phosphorylation of PLM affects its functional interactions. For example, Na+,K+-ATPase in sarcolemma membranes isolated from ischemic rat hearts has been found to be strongly stimulated compared with the controls, and this is accompanied by activation of PKA and PKC and phosphorylation of PLM (but not of the α-subunit) ((28Fuller W. Eaton P. Bell J.R. Shattock M.J. Faseb J. 2004; 18: 197-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). Two recent studies have concluded that, in cardiac myocytes, phosphorylation of PLM at the PKA site (Ser68) mediates the stimulatory effects of β-adrenergic agonists on Na+/K+-pump function (29Silverman B.Z.

It was proposed that PLM raises the K0.5 of Na+ ion for activating Na+,K+-ATPase and phosphorylation relieves this effect. Similarly in an experimental model of heart failure, phosphorylation of rabbit cardiac myocyte PLM is greatly increased (31Bossuyt J. Ai X. Moorman J.R. Pogwizd S.M. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated recently that phosphorylation of PLM is required for translocation of PLM from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane in mammalian cell (32Lansbery K.L. Burcea L.C. Mendenhall M.L. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 290: C1275-C1286Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). An FXYD protein in shark rectal gland membranes, which co-purifies with the α- and β-subunits, is termed PLMS because of its PLM-like phosphorylation sites, although the closest mammalian sequence homolog is in fact Mat-8 (33Mahmmoud Y.A.

Phosphorylation of PLMS by PKC or selective proteolysis of the C terminus, which removes the phosphorylated serine, increases Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Thus, the Na+,K+-ATPase activity is partially inhibited when the enzyme interacts with intact or unphosphorylated PLMS, and inhibition is relieved upon proteolysis or PKC phosphorylation (1Cornelius F. Mahmmoud Y.A. News Physiol. Sci. 2003; 18: 119-124PubMed Google Scholar). Structural interactions of FXYD proteins with α/β subunits are not well understood, but information is accumulating (3Garty H. Karlish S.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 431-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). There is now good evidence that the transmembrane segments of FXYD1 (PLM), FXYD2 (γ), FXYD4 (CHIF), and probably all other FXYD proteins lie within a groove bounded by M2, M6, and M9 of the α-subunit (36Hebert H.

There is also evidence for multiple interactions in the case of FXYD2, which imply that extramembrane domains also interact with the α-subunit and affect its function (39Fuzesi M. Gottschalk K.E.

It is an open question whether the extramembrane domains of all other FXYD proteins interact with the same or different domains of the α-subunit (see Ref. 41Mahmmoud Y.A. Vorum H. Cornelius F. J.

The present work makes use of the P. pastoris expression system for an initial characterization of functional interactions between the Na+,K+-ATPase and FXYD1 (PLM). Recently, we have described expression of Na+,K+-ATPase (porcine α1β1 subunits) in the methanotrophic yeast P. pastoris (42Strugatsky D. Gottschalk K.E. Goldshleger R. Bibi E. Karlish S.J. J. Biol.

This system offers an opportunity to look at interactions of FXYD proteins with the purified α/β complexes in vitro and, in principle, could allow extensive studies of functional and structural interactions of FXYD proteins under well controlled conditions. Here, we describe functional interactions detected either by co-expression of PLM with α/β subunits, or after in vitro reconstitution of separately expressed α/β subunits and PLM to form α/β/PLM complexes. The results show some interesting differences from those observed in Xenopus oocytes (26Crambert G. Fuzesi M. Garty H. Karlish S. Geering K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, for comparison with the P. pastoris system, we have also looked at effects of PLM expressed in HeLa cells, which have been used extensively to examine functional and structural interactions of FXYD proteins, particularly FXYD2 (γ) and FXYD4 (CHIF) (7Pu H.X.

Construction of the Clones pHIL-D2(α/His10-β), pHIL-D2(PLM), and pGAPzA(PLM)—A pHIL-D2 vector (Invitrogen) construct containing cDNAs encoding porcine α1 (GenBank™ accession X03938) and porcine β1 (GenBank™ accession no. X04635) with a 10× histidine tag at its N terminus (α/His10-β) has been described previously (43Cohen E. Goldshleger R. Shainskaya A. Tal D.M. Ebel C. le Maire M. Karlish S.J. J. Biol.

Human PLM (GenBank™ accession H23593) was subcloned either into the EcoRI site of pHIL-D2, or into the EcoRI/NotI site of pGAPZa (Invitrogen). In the pGAPZ vector PLM is constitutively expressed in P. pastoris under the GAPDH promoter. Yeast Transformation, Selection, and Growth—SMD1165, a protease-deficient strain (his4, prb1) of P. pastoris was transformed with 10 μg of NotI-linearized pHIL-D2(α/His10-β) construct. Preparation of spheroplasts and selection for His+,Muts transformants were done as described (42Strugatsky D. Gottschalk K.E. Goldshleger R. Bibi E. Karlish S.J. J. Biol.

The selected Muts clone showing the highest expression level of the enzyme was further transformed by electroporation with AvrII-linearized pGAPZ vector containing human PLM. Clone selection was done by Zeocin resistance and by DNA Dot Blot screening. The resulting positive clones showed methanol-inducible expression of α/His10-β and constitutive expression of PLM in the same cell (co-expression of α/His10-β with PLM). Independently, linear cDNA of PLM in pHIL-D2 (without α and His10-β cDNA) was used to transform spheroplasts, similarly to the pHIL-D2(α/His10-β) vector. This clone was used to express PLM alone and reconstitute it in vitro with the α/His10-β complex. Standard large scale 3-liter cultures were grown in Bellco Spinner Flasks™ with air supplement, magnetic stirring, and temperature maintained at 25 °C. Growth media were prepared from YNB medium (Difco) as described (42Strugatsky D. Gottschalk K.E. Goldshleger R. Bibi E. Karlish S.J. J. Biol.

Membranes were stored at –80 °C in MOPS-Tris, 10 mm, pH 7.2; EDTA, 1 mm; glycerol, 25% with protease inhibitors. Roughly, 1 g of membrane protein was obtained per 3-liter culture. Renal Na+,K+-ATPase was prepared as described (48Jorgensen P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Na+,K+-ATPase—Purification of α/His10-β co-expressed with PLM was done as described before (43Cohen E. Goldshleger R. Shainskaya A. Tal D.M. Ebel C. le Maire M.

Synthetic DOPS (cat. no. 830035) was obtained from Avanti, and stored as a chloroform solution. Urea-treated membranes were homogenized with n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (DDM:protein, 2:1 w/w) (cat. no. D310, Anatrace) in a medium containing NaCl, 250 mm; Tris-HCl, 20 mm, pH 7.4; imidazole, 5 mm; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm; and glycerol, 10%. The unsolubilized material was removed by ultracentrifugation. The soluble material was incubated for 6 h (α/His10-β, as control) or overnight (α/β-reconstituted PLM) at 4 °C with Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen), at a ratio of 100 μl of beads per 10 mg of soluble membrane protein. For standard preparations, 100-μl beads were washed with 1 ml of buffer containing NaCl, 100 mm; Tris-HCl, 20 mm, pH 7.4; DDM, 0.2 mg/ml; DOPS 0.05 mg/ml; glycerol, 10%, and imidazole, 30 mm (first wash) or imidazole, 60 mm (second wash).

The eluted protein was stored at 0 °C. Protein concentration was determined by comparative gel densitometry with pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase. In later experiments, purification was done using Co2+-chelate chromatography (BD-Talon Biosciences), which will be described fully in a forthcoming article. 4E. Cohen, H. Haviv, R. Goldshleger, and S. J. D. Karlish, manuscript in preparation. Briefly, the DDM-solubilized membranes were incubated with BD-Talon beads in the presence of 50 μm EDTA for the same period of time as with Ni2+-NTA beads and with the same beads: supernatant ratio. The beads were washed twice with NaCl, 100 mm; Tris-HCl, 20 mm, pH 7.4; DDM, 0.2 mg/ml; DOPS 0.05 mg/ml; glycerol, 10%, and imidazole, 10 mm, and eluted with imidazole, 150 mm; NaCl, 100 mm; Tris-HCl, 20 mm pH 7.4, DDM, 0.2 mg/ml; DOPS, 0.05 mg/ml; glycerol, 40%. For preparations to be used for Na+,K+ ATPase assay, washing and protein elution were done in the presence of choline chloride, 100 mm instead of NaCl. In Vitro Reconstitution of the α/His10-β/PLM Complex—Membranes expressing PLM in pHIL-D2 were solubilized in DDM (DDM:protein, 2:1 w/w), and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep YM-30 cat. no. 4322 by Amicon, Millipore) at 1500 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The retentate fraction containing PLM in micelles was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with Ni2+-NTA beads or BD-Talon beads pre-bound with the pig α1/His10-β1 complex. The α/β/PLM complex formed was then eluted as described above. SDS-PAGE, Western Blots, and Immunoprecipitation—2–5 μg of recombinant enzyme and 40 μg of yeast membranes were separated on 7.5%, or 10% polyacrylamide SDS-Tricine gels (49Schagger H. von Jagow G.

Gels were stained with Coomassie, scanned with an imaging densitometer (GS-690, Bio-Rad), and analyzed using the Multi-analyst software (Bio-Rad). Immunoblots were blotted with anti-KETYY antibody that recognizes the C terminus of the α-subunit, or with anti-β antibodies raised against the extracellular domain of the β-subunit (50Capasso J.M.

Na+,K+-ATPase assays of membranes (P. pastoris or HeLa cell) were carried out at 37 °C, and of purified complexes at 25 °C, both in a final volume of 100 μl, using [γ-32P]ATP. P. pastoris membranes were assayed for Na+,K+-ATPase activity at 0.5–0.8 mm ATP, and HeLa cells membranes at 1 mm ATP, with varying Na+ concentrations in the presence of 100 mm KCl. Assays using membrane preparations were done with or without 5 mm ouabain, and the Na+,K+-ATPase activity was calculated from the ouabain inhibitable fraction of ATP hydrolysis. For purified recombinant enzyme, 1 μl(≈0.2–0.4 μg of protein) was added to 100 μl of the reaction medium. DDM and lipid concentrations in the reaction medium were the same as in the elution buffer. The Na+,K+-ATPase activity of purified complexes was measured at 25 °C and 100 μm ATP in the presence of 100 mm KCl and different Na+ concentrations (0–100 mm). The ionic strength was maintained constant at 250 mm with choline chloride. Na+-ATPase activity was performed at 20 nm ATP in medium containing 250 mm NaCl plus choline chloride. Rates of ATP hydrolysis at different Na+ activities were fitted to the following form of the Hill equation: v = Vmax × [Na]nH/([Na]nH + K nH0.5) using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Soft"

During encystation, three cyst wall proteins (CWPs) are specifically expressed and concentrated within encystation-specific secretory vesicles (ESVs). ESVs are electron-dense secretory granules that transport CWPs before exocytosis and extracellular polymerization into a rigid cyst wall. Because secretory granules form at the trans-Golgi in higher eukaryotes and because Giardia lacks an identifiable Golgi apparatus, the aim of this work was to investigate the molecular basis of secretory granule formation in Giardia by examining the role of CWPs in this process. Although CWP1, CWP2, and CWP3 are structurally similar in their 26-kDa leucine-rich overlapping region, CWP2 is distinguished by the presence of a 13-kDa C-terminal basic extension. In non-encysting trophozoites, expression of different CWP chimeras showed that the CWP2 basic extension is necessary for biogenesis of ESVs, which occurs in a compartment derived from the endoplasmic reticulum. Nevertheless, the CWP2 basic extension per se is insufficient to trigger ESV formation, indicating that other domains in CWPs are also required. We found that CWP2 is a key regulator of ESV formation by acting as an aggregation factor for CWP1 and CWP3 through interactions mediated by its conserved region. CWP2 also acts as a ligand for sorting via its C-terminal basic extension. These findings show that granule biogenesis requires complex interactions among granule components and membrane receptors.

Giardia lamblia, a parasitic protozoan of humans and other vertebrates, is a major source of waterborne disease worldwide. Clinical signs of giardiasis vary from asymptomatic infection to acute or chronic disease associated with diarrhea and malabsorption. Giardia is also of biological interest because it derives from one of the earliest branches of the eukaryotic line of descent (1Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Giardia undergoes important biological changes to survive in hostile environments, alternating between the motile trophozoite and the environmentally resistant cyst (see Fig. 1) (1Adam R.D. Clin.

Trophozoites inhabit the upper small intestine and are responsible for symptoms of the disease, whereas cysts develop in the lower intestine and are excreted with the feces. This allows Giardia survival outside the intestine and transmission among susceptible hosts (1Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar).

Cell. 2000; 11: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The central region of CWP1 and CWP2 consists of five tandem leucine-rich repeats, whereas CWP3 has four complete and one incomplete leucine-rich repeat (8Sun C.H. McCaffery J.M. Reiner D.S. Gillin F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21701-21708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Leucine-rich repeat motifs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins have diverse functions and cellular localizations, but are always implicated in protein/protein interactions (10Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). The C terminus of CWPs has a cysteine-rich domain involved in the formation of disulfide-bonded oligomers (7Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Nash T.E. BowersB. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although CWPs are closely related to each other, CWP2 is distinguished from CWP1 and CWP3 by the presence of a basic 121-residue C-terminal extension. In CWP2, this C-terminal region is present within ESVs, but is proteolytically cleaved before cyst wall assembly. The C-terminal processing role of CWP2 in early encystation is unknown (2Luján H.D.

After synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), CWPs are shuttled to the cell exterior within ESVs. ESVs are large, morphologically irregular, electron-dense granules that form de novo, and their presence is the earliest morphological change observed during Giardia encystation (Fig. 1) (4Faubert G. Reiner D.S. Gillin F.D. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 72: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 11McCaffery J.M. Faubert G.M. Gillin F.D. Exp.

In cells from higher eukaryotes, regulated secretory proteins concentrate into a dense core that buds off, forming an immature secretory granule in the last portion of the Golgi apparatus (13Bauerfeind R. Huttner W.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Burgess T.L. Kelly R.B. Annu. Rev.

The Golgi apparatus consists of flattened cisternal membranes forming a stack and is remarkably conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution (16Griffiths G. Simons K. Science. 1986; 234: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar); however, a typical Golgi complex is not apparent in vegetative Giardia trophozoites (1Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that Giardia may possess organelle(s) in which typical Golgi functions take place, even though they do not have a Golgi-like appearance (1Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Constitutive and regulated mechanisms for protein transport exist in Giardia, suggesting Golgi functions, because the sorting and selection processes generally occur in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (17Rothman J.E. Orci L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1460-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The Giardia constitutive secretory pathway occurs by variant-specific surface protein (VSP) continuous transport to the plasma membrane and extracellular release. Additionally, hydrolytic enzyme sorting to lysosome-like peripheral vesicles is also a component of the constitutive pathway (3Luján H.D. Marotta A. Mowatt M.R. Sciaky N.

Chem. 2003; 278: 6420-6426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, knowledge of the regulated secretory pathway induced during Giardia encystation is limited and controversial (19Hehl A.B. Marti M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Luján H.D. Touz M.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopic studies indicate that synthesized CWPs are concentrated within flattened cisternae. These cisternae increase in size, forming large (>1-μm diameter) membrane-bound ESVs (7Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Nash T.E. BowersB. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12McCaffery J.M. Gillin F.D. Exp.

Detailed structural analyses of encysting cells (22Lanfredi-Rangel A. Attias M. Reiner D.S. Gillin F.D. De Souza W. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and the presence of BiP, an ER-resident chaperone, in these organelles (23Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad Nash J. T.T.E. Biol. Cell. 1996; 86: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar, 24Stefanic S. Palm D. Svärd S.G. Hehl A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7595-7604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) suggest that ESVs arise from modified ER cisternae. Whether these specific secretory granules form from an uncharacterized trans-Golgi or through condensation within the ER is unclear (20Luján H.D. Touz M.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Lanfredi-Rangel A. Attias M. Reiner D.S. Gillin F.D. De Souza W. J. Struct.

Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Nash T.E. BowersB. J. Biol.

Biol. 2003; 143: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) observed that CWPs aggregate within membrane-bound clefts. These aggregates appear to grow by direct addition of newly synthesized CWPs, forming large ESVs, suggesting that CWP accumulation is an important factor for granule formation. During encystation, inhibition of CWP synthesis abolishes ESV formation (25Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Piacenza L. Acosta D. Carmona C. Luján H.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, blocking CWP transport at low temperatures indicates that ESV formation depends on CWP export from the ER (26Marti M. Li Y. Schraner E.M. Wild P. Kohler P. Hehl A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1433-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that ESV formation is a direct consequence of CWP synthesis (20Luján H.D. Touz M.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We investigated the molecular basis of secretory granule formation by examining the role of CWPs and CWP chimeras in ESV biogenesis in Giardia. Our results suggest that secretory granule formation requires complex interactions between granule components (aggregation/condensation) and granule membrane receptors (sorting), involving both passive and active mechanisms. Construction of Expression Vectors—For CWP expression in Giardia, the corresponding genes were amplified with sense primers containing NcoI or ApaI sites and antisense primers containing EcoRV or SmaI sites. The products were purified, digested, and cloned into the pTubH7HApac vector as reported previously (18Touz M.C. Luján H.D. Hayes S.F. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6420-6426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Strategy and Oligonucleotides Used to Construct Different CWP Variants—To constitutively express cwp1, cwp2, cwp3, and cwp2 without the basic extension (cwp2(-TCWP2)), all fragments were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with the following sense (s) and antisense (as) oligonucleotides and cloned into the pTubHApac vector: CWP1s, 5′-CCA CCA TGG TGA TGC TCG CTC TCC TT-3′; CWP1as, 5′-GTT GAT ATC AGG CGG GGT GAG GCA G-3′; CWP2s, 5′-CCA CCA TGG TCG CAG CCC TTG TTC-3′; CWP2as, 5′-AGC GAT ATC CCT TCT GCG GAC AAT AGG-3′; CWP3s, 5′-CCA CCA TGG TTT CTC TGC TTC TTC TCC-3′; CWP3as, GTT GAT ATC TCT GTA GTA GGG CGG CTG-3′; CWP2-Ts, CCA CCA TGG TCG CAG CCC TTG TTC-3′; and CWP2-Tas, 5′-GTT GAT ATC GAC TAC TGT CTG CCT GTA GTA-3′. To constitutively express the CWP2 basic extension (TCWP2), the signal peptide of CWP2 was added in front of TCWP2. For this purpose, the fragment corresponding to the basic extension was amplified with a sense primer containing an XhoI site (TAILs, 5′-ACT CTC GAG AGA GAT GGA TGC ACG-3′) and antisense primer CWP2as. The fragment corresponding to the signal peptide was amplified with sense primer CWP2s and an antisense oligonucleotide containing an XhoI site (Spas, 5′-ATT CTC GAG AGC GGC GCG AGC A-3′). The two fragments were purified, digested with XhoI, and then ligated. The ligated product was re-amplified using primers CWP2s and CWP2as and cloned into the pTubHApac vector. The chimera cwp1(+TCWP2)-hemagglutinin (HA) was generated by PCR. cwp1 was amplified using primer CWP1s and an antisense oligonucleotide with a 5′-region complementary to the beginning of the cwp2 basic extension (MIX1, 5′-CTT TCG TCC CGA CGC ATT GCG AGG CGG GGT GAG GCA GTA C-3′). The basic tail (T-HA) was amplified using a sense oligonucleotide with a 5′-region complementary to the end of cwp1 (MIX2, 5′-GTA CTG CCT CAC CCC GCC TCG CA ATG CGT CGG GAC GAA AG-3′) and antisense primer CWP2as. The two fragments cwp1 (726 bp) and TCWP2 (363 bp) were purified and hybridized by a denaturation-hybridization round (95 °C for 2 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 73 °C for 10 min). The product was re-amplified by PCR using primers CWP1s and CWP2as and cloned into the pTubH7HApac vector. Strategy and Oligonucleotide Primers Used to Construct Different VSPH7 Chimeras—vspH7 without its transmembrane domain (vspH7(-TM)HA) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA with the following sense (s) and antisense (as) oligonucleotides and then cloned into pTubH7HApac: VSPH7-TMs, 5′-ATC GGG CCC ATG TTT CTA TTA ATT AAT TG-3′; and VSPH7-TMas, 5′-AGC GAT ATC GGA GAG GTT GGG GCC AC-3′. The chimera of vspH7 to which the basic extension of cwp2 was added, vspH7(-TM+TCWP2)-HA, was generated by PCR using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) following the protocol described by Geiser et al. (27Geiser M. Cebe R. Drewello D. Schmitz R. BioTechniques. 2001; 31: 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Briefly, vspH7 cloned in pTubH7HApac was modified to construct the chimera using primers that have sequences complementary to vspH7, to the basic extension of cwp2, and to the vector. The antisense oligonucleotide used had a 5′-region complementary to the vector and a 3′-region complementary to the end of cwp2 (TAILas, 5′-CAG GCA CAT TCA TAT GGA TAG ATA TCC CTT CTG CGG ACA ATA GGC TTG TTC-3′). The sense oligonucleotide had a 5′-region complementary to the region of interest of vspH7 and a 3′-region complementary to the beginning of the cwp2 basic extension (VSPH7-TM+Ts, 5′-CGG CGA TAG TGG CCC CAA CCT CTC CCT CGA GAG ATG GAT GCA CGT AC-3′). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Giardia Culture and Transfection—Clone WB/1267 trophozoites (28Nash T.E. Aggarwal A. Adam R.D. Conrad J.T. Merritt J.W. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 636-641PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured and induced to encyst as described previously (18Touz M.C. Luján H.D. Hayes S.F. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6420-6426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Trophozoites were transfected with the constructs by electroporation and selected with puromycin as described (18Touz M.C. Luján H.D. Hayes S.F. Nash T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6420-6426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After the transfection, clones with low expression were selected by immunoblot and immunofluorescence analyses. For transient coexpression, trophozoites were transfected with both plasmids at the same concentration (10 μg) and selected with puromycin, and clones were analyzed with the corresponding anti-CWP1 and anti-CWP2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Giardia Trophozoite Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells cultured in growth, pre-encystation, or encystation medium were harvested and processed as described previously (7Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Nash T.E. BowersB. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 1 h at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% normal goat serum. The cells were then incubated with the antibodies diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 3% goat serum. For indirect staining, slides were incubated with the specific mAbs (final dilution of 1:200) or anti-HA mAb (final dilution of 1:1000; Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by anti-mouse secondary antibody labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or rhodamine (final dilution of 1:250; ICN Biomedicals) for1hat37 °C. For direct double staining, FITC-conjugated anti-HA mAb (final dilution of 1:500) was used to detect the transgenic proteins; mAb 9C9 was directly labeled with Texas Red (Zenon One, Molecular Probes) for GRP78/BiP detection; and mAbs 5-3C and 7D2 were directly labeled with Texas Red or FITC (Zenon One) for endogenous CWP1 and CWP2 detection. The nuclei were visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Controls included no primary antibodies and untransfected cells. Confocal images were collected using a Zeiss LSM5 Pascal laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with an argon/helium/neon laser and a ×100 (numerical aperture = 1.4) oil immersion objective (Zeiss Plan-Apochromat). Single confocal sections of 0.3 μm were taken parallel to the coverslip (z sections). Images were acquired using a Zeiss charge-coupled device camera and processed with LSM and Adobe Photoshop software. Immunoblot and Secretion Assays—SDS-PAGE of total G. lamblia proteins was performed under reducing or nonreducing conditions as reported previously (7Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Nash T.E. BowersB. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For Western blot comparative analysis between different CWPs and CWP chimeras, five times more protein from transgenic trophozoites (100 μg instead of 20 μg) was loaded onto the gel because of the lower level of expression of the constructs expressed by the pTubHApac vector compared with CWP expression during encystation. For secretion, transfected cells were cultured in growth medium for 24 h. The cultured medium was collected and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to eliminate Giardia trophozoites. The collected medium was incubated with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) for 1 h at 4 °C. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates were centrifuged, and the resulting pellets were washed with iced-cold ethanol, dried, resuspended in 30 μl of sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA mAb. Electron Microscopy—Cultures were fixed in situ to preserve the cell organization when attached to the culture flask wall. After 30 min in fixative (2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0), the flask wall was lightly scraped to detach the trophozoites. The resulting suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g, and the pellet was placed in fresh fixative. Fixation was performed for 2 h, followed by post-fixation in 1% OsO4 with the addition of 1.25% potassium ferrocyanide for 1-2 h. During dehydration, the cells were prestained with 1% uranyl acetate in 70% ethanol for 2 h. The pellets were embedded in Araldite, and sections were cut in a Poter-Blum ultramicrotome. Thin, silver interference color (∼60 nm in thickness), serial sections were used. Single whole grids (oval, 2 × 1 mm; Pelco International) were used for collecting segments of 20 sections from series of 100-120 thin sections. The sections were stained first with saturated uranyl acetate in water and then with lead citrate. Sections were examined in a Siemens Elmiskop at magnifications standardized with diffraction grids. The CWP2 Basic Tail Is Necessary for Secretory Granule Biogenesis—To analyze CWP involvement in ESV biogenesis, different tagged versions of CWPs (Fig. 2A) were constitutively expressed in non-encysting trophozoites (Fig. 2B). We used a C-terminal HA epitope tag because CWPs have an N-terminal signal peptide that is processed during their trafficking through the secretory pathway (6Mowatt M.R. Luján H.D. Cotten D.B. Bowers B. Yee J. Nash T.E. Stibbs H.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 7Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Nash T.E. BowersB. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). After transfection, we analyzed protein expression by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy using either anti-HA or anti-CWP mAb. The expression level of the CWP chimera was always lower than that of endogenous CWP during encystation (∼5-fold lower compared with CWP expression in wild-type encysting cells) (data not shown). Localization of HA-tagged CWP during encystation was similar to that of native CWPs (see below), indicating that the HA tag did not affect their sub-cellular localization. Immunofluorescence assays using anti-HA mAb with constitutively HA-tagged CWP1 and CWP3 showed that both proteins localized to the ER in non-encysting trophozoites (Fig. 2B), as determined by their co-localization with the ER-resident chaperone BiP (23Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad Nash J. T.T.E. Biol. Cell. 1996; 86: 11-18PubMed Google Scholar). When the same assay was performed with HA-tagged CWP2, formation of large vesicles with characteristics similar to those of native ESVs was observed (Fig. 2B). Like ESVs in encysting trophozoites, these vesicles contained BiP (Fig. 2B). CWP2 differs from CWP1 and CWP3 by the presence of a 13-kDa basic extension at the C-terminal end (7Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Nash T.E. BowersB. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We deleted the CWP2 basic tail (TCWP2) to examine its role in ESV biogenesis. HA-tagged CWP2 without the basic extension (CWP2(-TCWP2)-HA) and CWP1 containing the CWP2 extension at its C terminus (CWP1(+TCWP2)-HA) were expressed in trophozoites (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence assays performed on non-encysting cells showed that CWP2 minus the basic extension localized in a cytoplasmic meshwork resembling the ER, a pattern similar to those of CWP1-HA, CWP3-HA, and BiP (Fig. 2B). The formation of ESV-like vesicles in cells expressing CWP1(+TCWP2)-HA was similar to that observed in non-encysting trophozoites with CWP2-HA (Fig. 2B)orin encysting trophozoites with wild-type CWP2 (7Luján H.D. Mowatt M.R. Conrad J.T. Nash T.E. BowersB. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29307-29313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These vesicles also co-localized with BiP (Fig. 2B). We confirmed the aforementioned localization with additional mAbs that detect CWP conformational states. These data suggest that the exogenous proteins undergo normal folding (supplemental Fig. 1). Negative staining in non-encysting trophozoites with mAb against granule-specific protein, an ESV-specific calcium-binding protein induced during encystation (29Touz M.C. Gottig N. Nash T.E. Luján H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50557-50563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), confirmed that these cells were not encysting (data not shown). In encysting cells, HA-tagged CWP1 and CWP3 constructs were sorted to secretory granules and co-localized with endogenous CWPs (Fig. 3A), indicating that native CWP2 reroutes CWP1 and CWP3 from the constitutive to the regulated pathway. In addition, immunofluorescence assays with anti-HA mAb were performed to confirm that these ESV-like granules behave like native ESVs. These experiments showed that CWP1-HA, CWP3-HA, and CWP2(-TCWP2)-HA were incorporated into the cyst wall similar to native CWPs (Fig. 3B). CWP2-HA and CWP1(+TCWP2)-HA were not detected in cyst walls using anti-HA mAb, in agreement with previous results showing that this basic extension is cleaved from CWP2 by an encystation-specific cysteine protease before cyst wall assembly (30Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Luján H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, the cysts generated in vitro from transfected cells were identical in shape to those obtained from untransfected organisms (Figs. 1 and 3B) and were resistant to hypo-osmotic shock (data not shown), suggesting that the HA tag in CWPs does not interfere with cyst wall formation. We also examined CWP expression by immunoblotting reduced and nonreduced protein extracts obtained from encysting and non-encysting Giardia trophozoites (Fig. 4). When extracts from cells expressing CWP1-HA ("

It is not known how the rise of Ca2+ concentration activates BAT thermogenesis. In this report we compared the effects of Ca2+ in BAT and liver mitochondria. Using electron microscopy and immunolabeling we identified a sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+-ATPase bound to the inner membrane of BAT mitochondria. A Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity was detected in BAT mitochondria when the respiratory substrates malate and pyruvate were included in the medium. ATP and Ca2+ enhanced the amount of heat produced by BAT mitochondria during respiration. The Ca2+ concentration needed for half-maximal activation of the ATPase activity and rate of heat production were the same and varied between 0.1 and 0.2 μm. Heat production was partially inhibited by the proton ionophore carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and abolished by thapsigargin, a specific ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, and by both rotenone and KCN, two substances that inhibit the electron transfer trough the mitochondrial cytochrome chain. In liver mitochondria Ca2+ did not stimulate the ATPase activity nor increase the rate of heat production. Thapsigargin had no effect on liver mitochondria.

The signal that activates the rate of heat production in BAT cells is the rise of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration from a basal level of 0.05 μm up to the range of 0.2–0.7 μm. This is promoted by α1- and β3-adrenergic receptors located in the cell membrane. Activation of α1-adrenoreceptors leads to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores into the cytosol, whereas β3-adrenergic receptors promote the release of free fatty acids and increase the effect of Ca2+ release induced by α1-adrenoreceptors (10Leaver E.V. Pappone P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1016-C1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Breitwieser G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C980-C1981Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). At present we do not know how the rise of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration activates the rate of heat production in BAT cells. In a previous report (12de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41856-41861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) we identified a sarco/ER Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA 1) in vesicles derived from BAT ER. In this report we show that the rate of heat produced by BAT mitochondria is enhanced when the Ca2+ concentration in the medium is raised to a level similar to that observed in BAT cells during adrenergic stimulation. This effect is not observed in liver mitochondria, a tissue that is not specialized in heat production. Isolation of Mitochondria from Rat BAT and Liver—Adult male Wistar rats were killed by decapitation. Mitochondria were isolated as previously described (13da-Siva W.S. Gómez-Puyou A. Gómez-Puyou M.T. Moreno-Sanchez R. De Felice F.G. de Méis L. Oliveira M.F. Galina A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39846-39855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, interscapular BAT and liver were removed and homogenized in a mixture containing 0.32 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS/Tris buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.2 mg ml of fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,330 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was carefully removed and centrifuged at 21,200 × g for 10 min. The pellet was re-suspended in 15% Percoll. A discontinuous density gradient was prepared manually by layering 3-ml fractions of the re-suspended pellet on two preformed layers consisting of 3.5 ml of 23% Percoll above 3.5 ml of 40% Percoll. Tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 37,700 × g. The material equilibrating near the interface between 23 and 40% Percoll layer was removed and gently diluted with the isolation buffer described above. The pellet was re-suspended in the isolation buffer. After centrifugation at 6,900 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was decanted and the pellet re-suspended in the same buffer using a fine Teflon pestle. Protein was determined by the Folin-Lowry method using serum albumin as standard (14Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles Derived from BAT Endoplasmic Reticulum—These were prepared as previously described (12de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41856-41861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Transmission Electron Microscopy and Immunolabeling—BAT was chopped to 1-mm3 pieces and fixed in 0.7% glutaraldehyde (v/v), 0.1% picric acid, 1% sucrose, 2% paraformaldehyde, and 5 mm CaCl2 in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2), dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Unicryl (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). Ultrathin sections were quenched in 50 mm NH4Cl for 30 min and incubated in the presence of monoclonal anti-Serca-1 antibodies (clone IIH11) from Affinity BioReagents, Inc., Brazil. After several washes in phosphate-buffered saline/1% albumin, sections were incubated in the presence of 10 nm of gold-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (BB International, UK), washed, and observed in a JEOL 1210 electron microscope. This method allows an adequate diffusion of the antibody but decreases the preservation of the material; therefore, it decreases the quality of the image. Isolated mitochondria were centrifuged at 150 × g for 15 min. The pellet was chopped into 1-mm3 pieces and treated as described above. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot—Samples were separated in a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel according to Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206281) Google Scholar). Electrotransfer of protein from the gel to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was performed for 15 min at 250 mA per gel in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol using a Mini Trans-Blot cell from Bio-Rad. Membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed and incubated for 1 h with monoclonal antibody anti-SERCA 1 at room temperature. The membranes were washed, and blots were revealed using an ECL detection kit from Amersham Biosciences (16Reis M. Farage M. de Meis L. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody for SERCA 1 (clone VE121G9) was obtained from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. Determination of ΔΨ—Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by using the fluorescence signal of the cationic dye safranine O, which is accumulated and quenched inside energized mitochondria (17Wieckowski M.R. Wojczak L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was detected with an excitation wavelength of 495 nm (slit 5 nm) and an emission wavelength of 586 nm. Other details were as described previously (13da-Siva W.S. Gómez-Puyou A. Gómez-Puyou M.T. Moreno-Sanchez R. De Felice F.G. de Méis L. Oliveira M.F. Galina A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39846-39855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). ATPase Activity—This was assayed as previously described (18Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using [γ-32P]ATP. Measurements were performed at 35 °C, and the reaction was arrested with trichloroacetic acid, final concentration 5% (w/v). In all experiments the amount of ATP cleaved never exceeded 20% of the total amount of ATP added in the assay medium. Heat of Reaction—This was measured using an OMEGA Isothermal Titration Calorimeter from MicroCal, Inc. (Northampton, MA). The calorimeter sample cell (1.5 ml) was filled with reaction medium, and the reference cell was filled with Milli-Q water. After equilibration at 35 °C, the reaction was started by injecting mitochondria into the sample cell, and the heat change was recorded for 30 min. The volume of mitochondria suspension injected in the sample cell varied between 0.03 and 0.05 ml. The heat change measured during the initial 5 min after mitochondria injection was discarded to avoid artifacts such as heat derived from the dilution of the mitochondria suspension in the reaction medium and binding of ions to mitochondria. The duration of these events is <1 min (12de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41856-41861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25078-25087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Negative heat values indicate that the reaction is exothermic, and positive values indicate that it is endothermic. The enthalpy of buffer protonation (ΔHp) was measured at 35 °C by measuring the heat released following the addition of known amounts of HCl to the assay medium, and the value found was –3.8 kcal/mol. The concentration of the different magnesium complexes and ionic species of ATP, ADP, Pi, and Ca2+ were calculated as previously described (20Schwartzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1957; 40: 1886-1900Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 21Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sorenson M.M. Coelho H.S.L. Reuben J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and from these values the fraction of ATP cleaved that generates free protons at pH 7.0, was estimated to be <30%. Thus, the heat derived from buffer protonation during ATP cleaved was ∼1 mcal/μmol of ATP cleaved. Ca2+ Uptake—This was measured by the filtration method (23Chiesi M. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10370-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For 45Ca uptake, trace amounts of 45Ca were included in the assay medium. The reaction was arrested by filtering samples of the assay medium through Millipore filters. After filtration, the filters were washed five times with 5 ml of 3 mm La(NO3)3, and the radioactivity remaining on the filters was counted using a liquid scintillation counter. Oxygen Uptake Measurements—Oxygen consumption was measured at 35 °C in a Strathkelvin oxymeter as previously described (13da-Siva W.S. Gómez-Puyou A. Gómez-Puyou M.T. Moreno-Sanchez R. De Felice F.G. de Méis L. Oliveira M.F. Galina A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39846-39855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Determination of Mitochondrial Hydrogen Peroxide Generation—Mitochondrial H2O2 production was assessed by the scopoletin oxidation method (13da-Siva W.S. Gómez-Puyou A. Gómez-Puyou M.T. Moreno-Sanchez R. De Felice F.G. de Méis L. Oliveira M.F. Galina A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39846-39855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 24Boveris A. Martino E. Stoppani A.O. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Experimental Conditions—These were similar to those found in the cell, i.e., pH 7.0–7.4, 2 mm Pi, 4 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl and different EGTA and CaCl2 concentrations. The free Ca2+ concentration in the medium was calculated as described previously (20Schwartzenbach G. Senn H. Anderegg G. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1957; 40: 1886-1900Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 21Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sorenson M.M. Coelho H.S.L. Reuben J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In most experiments ATP was included in the medium. In addition to being utilized by mitochondrial ATPases, ATP impair the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) found in BAT mitochondria. In all experiments we compared the effects obtained with BAT and liver mitochondria. The aim was to evaluate whether or not the effects observed were specific for BAT mitochondria. All experiments were performed at 35 °C. Transmission Electron Microscopy and Immunolabeling—In a previous work (12de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41856-41861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) we found that vesicles derived from BAT ER retain a membrane-bound Ca2+-ATPase that in Western blot reacted with antibodies for SERCA 1. This work began with an attempt to visualize in electron microscopy the BAT SERCA 1 attached to the membrane of the ER (25de Meis L. Oliveira G.M. Arruda A.P. Santos R. Costa R.M. Benchimol M. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When ultrathin sections were analyzed, to our surprise, we found that, in addition to the ER, the anti-SERCA 1 antibodies also reacted with BAT mitochondrial cristae. This could be visualized using 10 nm gold-labeled anti-mouse IgG. Labeling could be clearly identified in sections of whole tissue (Fig. 1) and in isolated mitochondria, where controls with (Fig. 2, c and d) and without anti-SERCA (Fig. 2, a and b) were compared. The presence of SERCA in BAT mitochondria was confirmed in different preparations examined.FIGURE 2Isolated mitochondria. Immunolabeling using anti-SERCA 1 antibody (c and d) and the corresponding controls (a and b) with gold-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG but without anti-SERCA 1. Intense labeling was observed on the mitochondria cristae (c and arrowheads in d). No labeling was detected in the control without anti-SERCA 1. Bars: 500 nm in a and c and 50 nm in b and d.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Western blot analysis of BAT mitochondria preparations revealed a faint band with the same mobility than SERCA 1 (Fig. 3). This band was detected in most, but not all BAT mitochondria preparations tested. In control experiments, the band was not detected when antibodies for SERCA 2 were used (data not shown). We were not able to identify a SERCA in liver mitochondria, suggesting that the presence of Ca2+-ATPase in mitochondria is a special feature of BAT cells. These findings led us to compare the effect of Ca2+ in mitochondria isolated from rats BAT and liver. Membrane Potential (ΔΨ)—In agreement with the bibliography (13da-Siva W.S. Gómez-Puyou A. Gómez-Puyou M.T. Moreno-Sanchez R. De Felice F.G. de Méis L. Oliveira M.F. Galina A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39846-39855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) we found that a mixture of pyruvate and malate (Fig. 4A) and ATP (Fig. 4B) promoted the formation of a membrane potential in liver mitochondria. The gradient formed by ATP was enhanced by the subsequent addition of pyruvate and malate (Fig. 4C). The liver mitochondrial ΔΨ was collapsed by Ca2+ (2 μm) and FCCP (1 μm). Contrasting with liver, BAT mitochondria were unable to form a measurable ΔΨ when ATP, pyruvate, and malate were added to the medium (Fig. 4D). These data show that the proton permeability of liver and BAT mitochondrial membrane are different. The Effect of Ca2+ on Mitochondrial ATPase Activity—In the absence of respiratory substrates, both liver and mitochondria catalyzed the hydrolysis of ATP, and the addition of 2 μm Ca2+ promoted a small increase of the ATPase activity in both mitochondrial preparations (Table 1). For liver mitochondria the addition of respiratory substrate to the medium did not lead to a significant change of the ATPase activity measured in the presence and absence of Ca2+ (Table 1). However, in BAT mitochondria, the addition of pyruvate and malate promoted a 2-fold increase of the Mg2+-dependent and a 10-fold increase of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activities (Fig. 5 and Table 1). The BAT ATPase activity measured in the presence of respiratory substrates varied significantly among the different mitochondria preparations tested (see ±S.E. in Table 1), however, in all of them there was a significant increment of the ATPase activity when Ca2+ was added to the medium. Despite the Ca2+-ATPase activity enhancement, very little Ca2+ was accumulated by BAT mitochondria, no more than 3–5 nmol/mg after 20-min incubation at 35 °C (data not shown).TABLE 1ATPase activity and heat production by BAT and liver mitochondriaAdditionsTissueATPase activityHeat productionMg2+Mg2+ + Ca2+Ca2+-dependentMg2+Mg2+ + Ca2+Ca2+-dependentμmol Pi/mg 20 minmcal/mg 20 minATPBAT0.79 ± 0.11 (10)0.83 ± 0.10 (10)0.11 ± 0.04 (10)-18 (2)-19 (2)-1 (2)Pyruvate + malate-95 ± 12 (4)-161 ± 12 (4)-71 ± 16 (4)ATP + pyruvate + malate1.69 ± 0.37 (9)2.83 ± 0.47 (9)1.11 ± 0.42 (9)-119 ± 20 (16)-295 ± 38 (16)-176 ± 32 (16)ATPLiver1.14 ± 0.08 (24)1.43 ± 0.11 (24)0.30 ± 0.04 (24)-47 (2)-74 (2)-27 (2)Pyruvate + malate-44 (2)-27 (2)ATP + pyruvate + malate1.36 ± 0.20 (7)1.54 ± 0.18 (7)0.22 ± 0.06 (7)-42 ± 6 (6)-21 ± 2 (6) Open table in a new tab Heat Production—A small amount of heat was produced when either BAT or liver mitochondria were incubated with ATP in the absence of respiratory substrate (Fig. 6 and Table 1). The heat produced by BAT mitochondria increased when pyruvate and malate were included in the assay medium (Table 1). A surprising new finding was that Ca2+ enhanced the rate of heat produced by BAT mitochondria with pyruvate and malate. The activation of heat production by Ca2+ was further enhanced when ATP was included in the media containing pyruvate and malate (Table 1 and Fig. 6). The increment promoted by ATP and Ca2+ exceeded the sum of the heat produced by the single addition of either ATP or respiratory substrates, indicating that, in the presence of pyruvate and malate, ATP magnifies the thermal effect of Ca2+. The amount of heat produced by liver mitochondria was smaller than that measured with BAT mitochondria in all the conditions tested in Table 1, i.e. only ATP, only respiratory substrates and a mixture of both ATP and respiratory substrates. In media containing ATP and no respiratory substrates, Ca2+ promoted a small increase in the rate of heat production. However, different from BAT, when respiratory substrates were used, Ca2+ decreased the rate of heat production in liver mitochondria, and ATP did not modify the effect of Ca2+ (Table 1). Ca2+ Dependence—In three experiments the Ca2+ concentration needed for half-maximal activation of both Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity and Ca2+-dependent heat production by BAT mitochondria was found to vary between 0.1 and 0.2 μm. This was measured using media containing ATP, pyruvate, and malate. When extrapolated to living cells, the data of Fig. 7 indicate that the concentration of Ca2+ needed to enhance heat production of isolated BAT mitochondria is in the same range as the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration measured in BAT cells during adrenergic stimulation (10Leaver E.V. Pappone P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1016-C1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Breitwieser G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C980-C1981Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Oxygen Consumption—In the absence of ATP, BAT mitochondria consumed oxygen at a fast rate when pyruvate and malate were added to the medium, indicating a lack of respiratory control. The addition of either ADP (Fig. 8A) or Ca2+ (Fig. 8B and Table 2) did not alter the rate of oxygen consumption. In the presence of ATP, however (Fig. 8C), the rate of oxygen consumption elicited by the respiratory substrates decreased, indicating that ATP restored the respiratory control of BAT mitochondria. The lack of respiratory control of BAT mitochondria, and its restoration by ATP, has already been described, and it is attributed to the binding of ATP to UCP1 (6Nicholls D.G. Rial E. J. Bioenerg.

The effect of ATP in Fig. 8C contrasts with the experiment of Fig. 4D where ATP was not able to restore the ΔΨ measured with safranine. The mitochondria protonmotive force (Δp), as defined by Mitchell (34Andrienko T. Kuznetsov A.V. Kaambre T. Usson Y. Orosco A. Appaix F. Tiivel T. Sikk P. Vendelin M. Margreiter R. Saks V.A. J. Exp.

Therefore, in the experimental conditions shown in Fig. 8C, BAT mitochondria were able to form a ΔpH but not a ΔΨ.TABLE 2Oxygen consumption and heat production by BAT and liver mitochondriaAdditionsHeat releasedO2 consumedRatiomcal/mg 20 minμmol/mg 20 minkcal/mol O2BAT mitochondria Mg2+-95 ± 12 (4)1.76 ± 0.17 (7)-54 Mg2+ + Ca2+-161 ± 12 (4)1.79 ± 0.19 (5)-90 ATP + Mg2+-119 ± 20 (16)0.39 ± 0.05 (8)-305 ATP + Mg2+ + Ca2+-295 ± 38 (16)2.22 ± 0.34 (8)-133Liver mitochondria EGTA + Mg2+-440.27 ± 0.03 (4)-163 Mg2+ + Ca2+-270.10 ± 0.02 (4)-270 ATP + Mg2+-42 ± 6 (6)0.51 ± 0.03 (6)-82 ATP + Mg2+ + Ca2+-21 ± 2 (6)0.20 ± 0.02 (5)-105 Open table in a new tab In Fig. 8C, the rate of oxygen consumption decreased with ATP, but the subsequent addition of Ca2+ sharply accelerated the rate of both oxygen utilization and heat released (Tables 1 and 2). A different pattern was observed with liver mitochondria (Fig. 8D and Table 2). The addition of pyruvate and malate elicited the consumption of oxygen (state 2), a small amount of ADP (50 μm) increased the rate of oxygen utilization (state 3), and at prolonged incubation intervals the rate decreased to a value similar to that observed before the addition of ADP (state 4). Different from BAT, in liver mitochondria ATP accelerated and Ca2+ decreased the rate of oxygen consumption (Fig. 8, compare C, E, and F). The heat generated during respiration depends, at least, on two different parameters, (i) the rate of oxygen consumption and (ii) the amount of heat produced during the utilization of each oxygen molecule (ratio of kilocalories/moles of O2 in Table 2). In BAT mitochondria, the effect of ATP varied depending on the addition of Ca2+. In the absence of Ca2+, ATP slowed down the rate of O2 consumption induced by pyruvate and malate but increased the heat/O2 ratio. This indicates that most of the energy derived from each oxygen molecule consumed was converted into heat. When Ca2+ was included, ATP accelerated the rate of O2 utilization, but from the parcel of energy released, only a fraction was converted in heat and the rest was converted in another form of energy not detected by the methods used. Effect of FCCP—The aim of these experiments was to verify if the effect of Ca2+ and ATP on heat formation were related to a formation of ΔpH in BAT mitochondria. The proton ionophore FCCP promoted a 50% decrease of the heat produced, but the activation by Ca2+ was not modified and the total amount of heat released was still larger than that of liver mitochondria (Fig. 9). The degree of inhibition did not vary when the FCCP concentration was raised from 1 up to 5 μm. This suggests that the gradient was not an absolute requirement for heat production as in the case of ATP synthesis from ADP and Pi, but it enhanced the effects of ATP and Ca2+. In liver mitochondria FCCP did not inhibit, but on the contrary, promoted a small increase of heat production (Fig. 9C). Inhibition of Heat Production by Drugs—Thapsigargin is a specific inhibitor of the various SERCA isoforms. The BAT ATPase activity measured in the presence of Mg2+ was not modified by thapsigargin. However, both the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity and the heat produced by BAT mitochondria in the presence of ATP, pyruvate, and malate were inhibited by thapsigargin (Figs. 10 and 11A and Table 3). The concentration of thapsigargin needed for half-maximal inhibition of BAT mitochondria was found to vary between 1 and 2 μm. This is two to three orders of magnitude higher than the concentration needed to inhibit the SERCA isoforms found in vesicles derived from the ER of BAT and skeletal muscle (12de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41856-41861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Contrasting with BAT, the small amount of heat produced by liver mitochondria was not impaired by thapsigargin (Fig. 11B and Table 3).FIGURE 11Effect of thapsigargin on the rate of heat production by BAT (A) and liver mitochondria (B). In A the assay medium composition was 50 mm MOPS/Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm Pi, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm pyruvate, 1 mm malate, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 (free Ca2+ = 3.9 μm).

In B the assay medium was the same as in A, but the EGTA concentration was raised to 10 mm and no CaCl2 was added to the medium.

Both drugs strongly inhibited the heat produced by BAT mitochondria (Fig. 12), indicating that the energy-transducing system responsible for heat production depends on the electrons transfer trough the mitochondrial cytochromes chain. In addition to heat production, rotenone promoted a 60% inhibition of the mitochondria ATPase activity (average of two experiments, data not shown). Reactive Oxygen Species and Endoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+-ATPase Contamination—BAT mitochondria did not generate a measurable formation of reactive oxygen species in media containing ATP, pyruvate, malate, and Ca2+ (data not shown). This was tested in three different BAT mitochondrial preparations. The Ca2+-ATPase activity measured in the BAT mitochondrial fraction was not due to a contamination with vesicles derived from the ER because: (i) in a previous report (12de Meis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41856-41861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) it was shown that the thapsigargin concentration needed for half-maximal inhibition of the ER Ca2+-ATPase was 1 nm, whereas for BAT mitochondria, half-maximal inhibition was only attained with 1–2 μm thapsigargin (Fig. 10A), i.e. a three orders of magnitude higher concentration than that needed for the ER; (ii) the Ca2+-ATPase activity, Ca2+ transport, and heat production by vesicles derived from BAT ER were not inhibited by FCCP, rotenone, and KCN as observed for BAT mitochondria (data not shown). Several reports (34Andrienko T. Kuznetsov A.V. Kaambre T. Usson Y. Orosco A. Appaix F. Tiivel T. Sikk P. Vendelin M. Margreiter R. Saks V.A. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 2059-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Shkryl V.M. Shirokova N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1547-1554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) have described a close association between the ER and mitochondria and that Ca2+ can be transferred from the ER to the mitochondria matrix. However, as far as we know, there are no reports describing a Ca2+-ATPase located within the mitochondria. The data presented indicate that the Ca2+ released in the cytosol of adipocytes during adrenergic stimulation interact directly with the mitochondria activating the rate of heat production. The main findings that correlate the Ca2+-ATPase visualized in Figs. 1 and 2 with the enhancement of heat production are (i) a Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity was detected in BAT mitochondria when respiration was activated with pyruvate and malate (Fig. 5); (ii) the Ca2+ concentration needed for half-maximal activation of both the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity and Ca2+-dependent heat production were the same (Fig. 7); and (iii) both activities were inhibited by thapsigargin (Figs. 10 and 11). We do not know why the concentration of thapsigargin needed to inhibit the mitochondrial Ca2+-ATPase is much higher than that needed to inhibit the various SERCA isoforms. Thapsigargin is a highly hydrophobic substance. One possibility that may account for this discrepancy is that the Ca2+-ATPase of the ER is exposed in the outer surface of vesicles (25de Meis L. Oliveira G.M. Arruda A.P. Santos R. Costa R.M. Benchimol M. IUBMB Life. 2005; 57: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Inesi G. Asai I. Arch. Biochem.

Physiol. 1985; 47: 573-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is readily accessible to the thapsigargin in solution, whereas in BAT the Ca2+-ATPase is buried inside the mitochondria. Thus, a large amount of thapsigargin can be trapped by the extensive mitochondrial membrane surface and a high concentration of the drug would be needed to reach the Ca2+-ATPase located in the mitochondria inner space. In liver and Trypanosome brucei mitochondria, high concentrations of thapsigargin (15–20 μm) was found to promote Ca2+ release and collapse of the membrane potential. In concentrations lower than 10 μm, thapsigargin had no effect on both types of mitochondria (38Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N. Bernardes C.F. Meinicke A.R. Fernandes E.C. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8564-8568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the past decade (1Nichols D. Locke R.M. Physiol.

Rev. 2004; 84: 277-35964Crossref PubMed Scopus (4456) Google Scholar), heat production by BAT has been correlated with thermogenin or uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). This protein is inserted in the mitochondria membrane, and when activated, it would act as an H+ pore. During proton leakage osmotic energy would be converted into heat and the decrease of the gradient promoted by the leakage would accelerate the various reactions involved in O2 consumption with more heat production. The leakage of H+ through the UCP1 is impaired by ATP and activated by fatty acids (9Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-35964Crossref PubMed Scopus (4456) Google Scholar, 26Rial E.

In conditions of maximal heat production shown in Table 1 and Fig. 6, UCP1 was probably inactive, because ATP was included in the medium to maximize the rate of heat production elicited by Ca2+ (Table 1). Furthermore, fatty acids were not added to the assay medium, and the solutions used to isolate mitochondria contained an excess of fatty acid-free albumin to avoid fatty acid contamination. Recent studies (39Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C.

The experiments described in this report suggest that in rat BAT mitochondria the presence of an H+ gradient is not an absolute requirement for heat production, because a large amount of heat could be detected even after the addition of the proton ionophore FCCP (Fig. 9). Finally, on the basis of the data presented, we hypothesize that BAT mitochondria would be able to synthesize ATP during the electron flux through the cytochromes without the need to form a ΔΨ or ΔpH, and the ATP synthesized would then be cleaved by the Ca2+-ATPase before leaving the mitochondria. Thus, heat would be derived from the continuous synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP in the mitochondria matrix. We are grateful to Valdecir A. Suzano and Antônio Carlos Miranda for technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2136273446,"Cladosporium herbarum is an important allergenic fungal species that has been reported to cause allergic diseases in nearly all climatic zones. 5-30% of the allergic population displays IgE antibodies against molds. Sensitization to Cladosporium has often been associated with severe asthma and less frequently with chronic urticaria and atopic eczema. However, no dominant major allergen of this species has been found so far. We present cloning, production, and characterization of NADP-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase of C. herbarum (Cla h 8) and show that this protein is a major allergen that is recognized by IgE antibodies of approximately 57% of all Cladosporium allergic patients. This is the highest percentage of patients reacting with any Cladosporium allergen characterized so far. Cla h 8 was purified to homogeneity by standard chromatographic methods, and both N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences of protein fragments were determined. Enzymatic analysis of the purified natural protein revealed that this allergen represents a NADP-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase that interconverts mannitol and d-fructose. It is a soluble, non-glycosylated cytoplasmic protein. Two-dimensional protein analysis indicated that mannitol dehydrogenase is present as a single isoform. The cDNA encoding Cla h 8 was cloned from a lambda-ZAP library constructed from hyphae and spores. The recombinant non-fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Its immunological and biochemical identity with the natural protein was shown by enzyme activity tests, CD spectroscopy, IgE immunoblots with sera of patients, and by skin prick testing of Cladosporium allergic patients. This protein therefore is a new major allergen of C. herbarum."
https://openalex.org/W2115744047,"Keratin polypeptide 20 (K20) is an intermediate filament protein with preferential expression in epithelia of the stomach, intestine, uterus, and bladder and in Merkel cells of the skin. K20 expression is used as a marker to distinguish metastatic tumor origin, but nothing is known regarding its regulation and function. We studied K20 phosphorylation as a first step toward understanding its physiologic role. K20 phosphorylation occurs preferentially on serine, with a high stoichiometry as compared with keratin polypeptides 18 and 19. Mass spectrometry analysis predicted that either K20 Ser13 or Ser14 was a likely phosphorylation site, and Ser13 was confirmed as the phospho-moiety using mutation and transfection analysis and generation of an anti-K20-phospho-Ser13 antibody. K20 Ser13 phosphorylation increases after protein kinase C activation, and Ser13-to-Ala mutation interferes with keratin filament reorganization in transfected cells. In physiological contexts, K20 degradation and associated Ser13 hyperphosphorylation occur during apoptosis, and chemically induced mouse colitis also promotes Ser13 phosphorylation. Among mouse small intestinal enterocytes, K20 Ser13 is pref erentially phosphorylated in goblet cells and undergoes dramatic hyperphosphorylation after starvation and mucin secretion.

All IF proteins consist of a central α-helical “rod” domain that is flanked by non-α-helical N-terminal “head” and C-terminal “tail” domains. Expression of unique complements of type I (keratin polypeptides 9–20 (K9–K20)) and type II (K1–K8) keratins, which associate at a noncovalent 1:1 ratio of type I to type II heteropolymers, distinguishes different epithelial subtypes. For example, keratinocytes preferentially express K5/K14 or K1/K10 depending on their differentiation state in the epidermis; adult hepatocytes express K8/K18 exclusively, whereas intestinal epithelial cells express K8 as the major type II keratin with varying levels of the type I keratins, K18/K19/K20, depending on the differentiation state (e.g. crypt versus villus cells) or cell type (e.g. goblet versus absorptive cell) (1Moll R.

These functions are mechanical and nonmechanical in nature and include providing tissue and cell integrity, protecting cells from apoptosis and nonmechanical forms of injury, tissue-specific functions, cell signaling, and maintenance of subcellular organelle positioning and functions. Keratin and other IF protein functions are regulated by posttranslational modifications (2Coulombe P.A. Omary M.B. Curr. Opin.

Of the more than 20 keratins, only K1, K4–K6, K8, K18, and K19 have been studied in terms of their phosphorylation (11Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Tao G.Z. Toivola D.M. Liao J. Trends Biochem.

Of these keratins, the most extensively studied are K8 and K18, with several established generalized or site-specific roles for their phosphorylation that include: (i) serving as a marker of epithelial cell injury (18Toivola D.M. Ku N.O. Resurreccion E.Z. Nelson D.R. Wright T.L. Omary M.B. Hepatology. 2004; 40: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar); (ii) protecting the liver in transgenic mice from toxic injury (19Ku N.O. Michie S.A. Soetikno R.M. Resurreccion E.Z.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10775-10782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, the understanding of keratin phosphorylation has provided a useful handle to study keratin function. Among the epithelial keratins, K20 has several unique properties. When compared with all other type I keratins, K20 has greater sequence divergence with only 58% amino acid identity within the conserved α-helical rod domain with the closest keratin, K14 (24Chandler J.S. Calnek D. Quaroni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 266: 11932-11938Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It has unique cell distribution that is nearly confined to the gastric and intestinal epithelium, urothelium, bladder, and Merkel cells (25Calnek D. Quaroni A. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26Leech S.N. Kolar A.J. Barrett P.D. Sinclair S.A. Leonard N. J. Clin. Pathol. 2001; 54: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because of its restricted distribution, K20 has been widely used clinically as a marker to help assess the origin of metastatic tumors (27Moll R. Lowe A. Laufer J. Franke W.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 427-447PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wildi S. Kleeff J. Maruyama H. Maurer C.A. Friess H. Buchler M.W. Lander A.D. Korc M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 10: 2840-2847Google Scholar). The biological role of K20 is unclear, although mating experiments with transgenic mice that overexpress wild-type or mutant K18 or K20 have clearly demonstrated that K20 provides filament organization functional redundancy in cells that express more than one type I keratin (3Zhou Q. Toivola D.M. Franke W.W. Omary M.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2959-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, the preferential expression of K20 in suprabasal villus cells (3Zhou Q. Toivola D.M. Franke W.W. Omary M.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2959-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and its marked induction in acinar cells after pancreatic injury (29Zhong B. Zhou Q. Toivola D.M. Tao G.Z. Resurreccion E.Z. Omary M.B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1709-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggest that it may have differentiation or stress-related functions. As a step toward understanding K20 regulation and function, we have described here the characterization of K20 phosphorylation. We show that K20 Ser13 phosphorylation is: (i) increased upon protein kinase C (PKC) activation, (ii) induced during apoptosis and tissue injury, and (iii) serves as a unique marker of small intestinal goblet cells. Cells and Reagents—HT29 (human colon), NIH-3T3 (mouse fibroblast), and BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. BHK-21 cells do not express endogenous keratins (20Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26792-26798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 21Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that were used included: L2A1 and DC10 (anti-human (h) K18), M20 (anti-hK8), ITKs20.10 (anti-hK20) (Neomarkers); mAb 4.62 (anti-hK19 (Sigma)); M30 (anti-caspase cleaved K18 (Roche Applied Science)). The antimucin antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Laurie L. Shekels (University of Minnesota). Other reagents include: phosphoric acid (32PO4; PerkinElmer Life Sciences); trypsin and chymotrypsin (Worthington); okadaic acid (OA; Alexis Biochemicals); phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma); anisomycin (Calbiochem). Apoptosis was induced in HT29 cells (80–90% confluent) by culturing them with anisomycin (10 μg/ml) for 18 h. Cells were also cultured in the presence of PMA (200 ng/ml) for 30 min. Whole cell lysates were isolated by solubilizing in 2% SDS-containing Laemmli sample buffer for one dimensional SDS-PAGE or in a urea-containing buffer for isoelectric focusing (IEF). Antibody Generation and Characterization—Human K20 was expressed using a pET bacterial protein expression system, and partially purified K20 was used to immunize Balb/c mice. After fusion and screening, one clone (termed Q6) was chosen, subcloned, and propagated. In addition, a rabbit phospho (p)-epitope-specific antibody was generated commercially (Anaspec) against the peptide CFHRSLpSSS-LQA, which recognizes the human and mouse pSer13-containing K20. The Cys residue (which is not part of the K20 peptide) was added to the peptide sequence to facilitate peptide coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Two rabbit antibodies, Ab 2667 and Ab 2668 were generated. Ab 2667 showed superior reactivity to the K20 phosphoepitope (not shown) and was the antibody used for all described experiments. Mouse Strains—Balb/c and FVB/n mice were used. For the starvation experiment, mice were given water alone for 18 h followed by tissue harvesting. For the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) treatment, 5% DSS added in drinking water for 7 days was replaced with regular water for 12 h before sacrificing. All animals received care according to standard accepted criteria and guidelines. Keratin Immunoprecipitation, Dephosphorylation, and High Salt Extraction—HT29 cells were solubilized with 1% Nonidet P-40 or with 1% Empigen in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After pelleting, supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with mAb L2A1 (anti-K18), 4.62 (anti-K19), or Q6 (anti-K20). Isoelectric focusing was done as recommended by the supplier of the apparatus (Bio-Rad). High salt extraction was carried out to partially purify the majority of cellular keratins (30Ku N.O. Toivola D.M. Zhou Q. Tao G.Z. Zhong B. Omary M.B. Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 78: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For keratin dephosphorylation, keratin immunoprecipitates (isolated from HT29 cells) were incubated with shrimp alkaline phosphatase (37 °C, 1 h) followed by washing and then IEF/SDS-PAGE, gel transfer, and immunoblotting. Phosphoamino Acid Analysis and Peptide Mapping—HT29 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h (250 μCi/ml) followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-K20 mAb. After gel separation and Coomassie Blue staining, the K20 band was removed following by extraction of K20 by electroelution. 32P-Labeled K20 was subjected to acid hydrolysis and phosphoamino acid analysis (31Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide mapping of electroeluted 32P-labeled K20 was carried out by exhaustive trypsinization of isolated K20 followed by two-dimensional gel analysis using electrophoresis in the horizontal direction and chromatography in the second dimension (31Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation Site Identification Using Mass Spectrometry—HT29 cells were cultured in the presence of OA (1 μg/ml, 2 h) followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-K20 mAb, gel separation, and then in-gel digestion using trypsin. Briefly, gel pieces were destained in 25 mm NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile, reduced using 10 mm dithiothreitol in 25 mm NH4HCO3, alkylated using 50 mm iodoacetamide, and then digested overnight using 50 ng of modified porcine trypsin in 25 mm NH4HCO3. Peptides were extracted using 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid and then separated on an Ultimate chromatography system with a 75 μm × 15 cm Pepmap column (both from LC-Packings). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, and a gradient of 5–40% B over 30 min was employed for peptide separation. As peptides eluted they were introduced on-line into a QSTAR Pulsar mass spectrometer (Sciex/Applied Biosystems). One-second spectra of intact peptides were followed by automatic selection of the most intense eluting peptide for a 3-s fragmentation spectrum. Peak masses and fragment ion assignments were labeled according to the nomenclature of Biemann (32Biemann K. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we searched for data using the search engine Mascot (Matrix Science) and then manually analyzed them to confirm assignments. Mutagenesis, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence Staining—The human K20 cDNA was mutated to convert Ser13 or Ser14 to Ala using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transfections into NIH-3T3 or BHK-21 cells were done using WT or mutant hK20 cDNA plus hK8 cDNA. When needed, OA (1 μg/ml, 2 h) was added just prior to harvesting. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described (30Ku N.O. Toivola D.M. Zhou Q. Tao G.Z. Zhong B. Omary M.B. Methods Cell Biol. 2004; 78: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For total K20 staining, we used the anti-K20 mAb ITKs20.10, because the Q6 mAb does not work well after methanol fixation (not shown). For quantification of filament reorganization, cells from each treatment were counted (∼150 cells/treatment) and categorized as having an exclusive punctuate pattern (dots) or a mixed punctate/filamentous pattern (collapsed) or lacking any punctuate pattern (normal filaments). K20 Has Multiple Serine Phosphorylation Sites—As part of the initial biochemical characterization of K20 phosphorylation, we sought to generate monoclonal antibodies to K20. This was done by cloning human K20 cDNA into a bacterial expression system (see “Experimental Procedures”) and then using a partially purified hK20 protein as an antigen for mouse immunization. After fusion and hybridoma screening and selection (not shown), the Q6 clone was chosen because of its strong and specific affinity to hK20 as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1A) and Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Association of K20 with its type II partner, K8, after Empigen solubilization, is weaker than K18-K8 association (compare lanes 2 and 4, Fig. 1A). The identity of the Q6-immunoprecipitated species (Fig. 1A, arrowhead in lane 4) was confirmed by microsequencing (not shown) and by immunoblotting using an independent commercial anti-K20 mAb (ITKs20.10) (Fig. 1A). Two-dimensional gel analysis of Q6 immunoprecipitates showed multiple charged isoforms that were recognized by mAb ITKs20.10, suggesting a high basal K20 phosphorylation state (Fig. 1B). Treatment of keratin immunoprecipitates with alkaline phosphatase collapsed all the spots that were separated by IEF into one unphosphorylated species (Fig. 1C). This indicates that the multiply charged K20 isoforms are likely generated by K20 phosphorylation. An initial assessment of K20 phosphorylation was carried out by in vivo labeling of HT29 cells with 32PO4 followed by immunoprecipitation of K20 and then analysis by two-dimensional gels, phosphoamino acid determination and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. As shown in Fig. 2A, the specific activity of K20 phosphorylation is significantly higher when compared with K18 but similar to K19 and K8. The 32PO4-radiolabeled species immunoprecipitated by the anti-K20 mAb (Q6) includes only the acidic isoforms of K20, as confirmed by two-dimensional gel analysis (Fig. 2B). Most of the K20 phosphorylation under basal conditions involves serines (Fig. 2C) and includes several tryptic phosphopeptides, which suggests multiple phosphorylation sites (Fig. 2D; also supported by Fig. 1C). The nearly exclusive serine phosphorylation of K20 is similar to other keratins (11Omary M.B. Ku N.O. Tao G.Z. Toivola D.M. Liao J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). However, the presence of multiple phosphorylation sites under basal conditions suggests that K20 has multiple dynamic sites, which in contrast to other type I keratins for which phosphorylation has been characterized and that have only one major phosphorylation site (hK18 Ser52 (33Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar); hK19 Ser35 (15Zhou X. Liao J. Hu L. Feng L. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12861-12866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)). Identification of Ser13 as a K20 Phosphorylation Site That Is Regulated by PKC Activation—We used mass spectrometry to identify K20 phosphorylation sites. The starting material for this analysis was K20 purified from OA-treated cells, in order to maximize phosphorylation at sites protected by protein phosphatase 2A inhibition. As shown in Fig. 3, this analysis suggested that K20 Ser13 or Ser14 is phosphorylated within the K20 tryptic peptide 10(R)SLSSSLQAPVVSTVGMQR. Mutational analysis was then carried out by transfecting BHK-21 cells with K20 S13A or K20 S14A (together with the partner K8 to stabilize the transfected K20) (Fig. 4, A and B). Immunoblotting of two-dimensionally separated lysates from the transfected cells showed that mutation of K20 Ser13, but not K20 S14, ablated a major K20 acidic isoform (Fig. 4B). This provides a molecular confirmation of the mass spectrometry results and indicates that K20 Ser13 is phosphorylated in cultured cells.FIGURE 4Confirmation that Ser13 rather than Ser14 is a K20 phosphorylation site. A, protein sequence of the region surrounding K20 Ser13 and Ser14. The underlined sequence was used to generate a rabbit anti-phosphopeptide antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures” (see Fig. 5 for characterization of this antibody). B, BHK-21 cells were transfected with WT K8 and one of three K20 constructs (WT, S13A, or S14A). Total cell lysates were then prepared and analyzed by two-dimensional gels (IEF and then SDS-PAGE) followed by immunoblotting with anti-K20 mAb Q6. The arrows point to the phospho-isoform of K20, which is absent in the K20 S13A transfectant cell lysate. C, HT29 cells were cultured alone (Control) or in the presence of PMA (30 min). Total cell lysates were then separated by two-dimensional gels and blotted with mAb Q6 as described in B. Isoform spots 1–3 are indicated, and the relationship of their relative intensity is shown. Notably, HT29 cells have two apparent phospho-K20 isoforms, whereas transfected BHK-21 cells have only one. This difference is likely because of the transient transfection that represents a stress (20Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26792-26798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and results in different keratin phosphorylation states than what is seen in untransfected HT29 cells (55Ku N.O. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7556-7564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The presence or activation of different kinases in the two cell lines may also play a role.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sequence context of K20 Ser13 (RXXS) suggests that it is a potential PKC substrate (34Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis by treating HT29 cells with PMA (a PKC activator) followed by immunoblotting using mAb Q6. As shown in Fig. 4C, PMA enhanced K20 phosphorylation (based on the increases in relative intensity in spots 2 and 3). Effect of K20 Ser13 Mutation on Keratin Filament Organization—Given that keratin phosphorylation can play a role in keratin filament organization (15Zhou X. Liao J. Hu L. Feng L. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12861-12866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Ku N.O. Azhar S. Omary M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10775-10782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we tested whether K20 Ser13 → Ala (S13A) has an effect on keratin filament assembly. Under basal conditions, co-transfection of K8 with K20 S13A into NIH-3T3 cells does not have a significant effect on keratin filament assembly as compared with K20 WT or S14A transfectants. However, okadaic acid treatment, which results in the rearrangement of keratin filament networks (35Ku N.O. Gish R. Wright T.L. Omary M.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1580-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 36Strnad P. Windoffer R. Leube R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4133-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), caused significantly more keratin filament reorganization in cells transfected with WT or S14A K20 as compared with K20 S13A (Table 1). These results indicate that K20 Ser13 phosphorylation is important in promoting the disassembly of keratin filaments.TABLE 1Quantification of keratin filament reorganization after OA treatment of transfected NIH-3T3 cellsIntact filamentsCollapsed networkDots%%%WT K2043525S13A K2070237S14A K2044533 Open table in a new tab Characterization of K20 Ser13 Phosphorylation Using a Phosphoepitope-specific Antibody—We used the synthetic K20 phosphopeptide (8FHRSLpSSSLQA, see Fig. 4A), which includes pSer13 and is conserved in humans and mice, to immunize rabbits and generate a phosphoepitope-specific antibody. The generated antibody, Ab 2667 (see “Experimental Procedures”), manifested much higher reactivity toward phospho-K20 (pK20) after cells were cultured in the presence of OA, as confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A) and immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 6D). As anticipated for a phosphoepitope-specific antibody, Ab 2667 recognizes only the acidic K20 isoforms after separation by IEF (Fig. 5B). This antibody also recognizes pSer13 specifically, as confirmed by transfecting cells with WT, S13A, or S14A K20 followed by two-dimensional immunoblotting, which showed that reactivity of Ab 2667 is abolished only in the S13A K20 transfectants (Fig. 5C). The utility of Ab 2667 was verified further by showing that its reactivity with K20 increases after HT29 cells were cultured in the presence of PMA (Fig. 5D). Ab 2667 also recognizes the same conserved phospho-site in mouse K20, and testing its binding to mouse intestine indicated that small intestine K20 Ser13 is more phosphorylated as compared with K20 in the colon (Fig. 5E; note the relative levels of K20 versus phospho-K20 in the two tissues).FIGURE 6K20 degradation and phosphorylation during apoptosis. A, K20 (424 amino acids) has a potential caspase cleavage site at Asp228 within the sequence 225VEVDAAP, with predicted generation of p23 and p26 fragments. B and C, HT29 cells were cultured in the presence (+) or absence (–) of anisomycin (An) followed by immunoprecipitation of K20. The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and then Coomassie staining or by immunoblotting using antibodies to K20 and pK20. D, HT29 cells were cultured in the presence or absence of OA followed by double staining using anti-K20 (ITKs20.10) and anti-pK20 (Ab 2667) antibodies.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of the δ subunit gene (Δδ) was shown to result in a massive destabilization of the mitochondrial genome (mitochondrial DNA; mtDNA) in the form of 100% ρ–/ρ° petites (i.e. cells missing a large portion (>50%) of the mtDNA (ρ–) or totally devoid of mtDNA (ρ°)). Previous work has suggested that the absence of complete mtDNA (ρ+) in Δδ yeast is a consequence of an uncoupling of the ATP synthase in the form of a passive proton transport through the enzyme (i.e. not coupled to ATP synthesis). However, it was unclear why or how this ATP synthase defect destabilized the mtDNA. We investigated this question using a nonrespiratory gene (ARG8m) inserted into the mtDNA. We first show that retention of functional mtDNA is lethal to Δδ yeast. We further show that combined with a nuclear mutation (Δatp4) preventing the ATP synthase proton channel assembly, a lack of δ subunit fails to destabilize the mtDNA, and ρ+ Δδ cells become viable. We conclude that Δδ yeast cannot survive when it has the ability to synthesize the ATP synthase proton channel. Accordingly, the ρ–/ρ° mutation can be viewed as a rescuing event, because this mutation prevents the synthesis of the two mtDNA-encoded subunits (Atp6p and Atp9p) forming the core of this channel.

This is the first report of what we have called a “petite obligate” mutant of S. cerevisiae. The mitochondrial inner membrane contains the ATP synthase, which utilizes a transmembrane proton gradient to catalyze ATP synthesis from inorganic phosphate and ADP. The ATP synthase has two major structural domains, an F0 component, which forms a proton-permeable pore across the membrane, and a peripheral, matrix-localized, F1 component, where the ATP is synthesized (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). The F1 domain comprises five different subunits, all nucleus-encoded, with α3β3γ1δ1ϵ1 stoichiometry. The three α subunits and the three β subunits alternate in position within a hexamer that contains the adenine nucleotide processing sites (2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

The γ, δ, and ϵ subunits form a subcomplex of F1, named the central stalk, linking the α3β3 subcomplex to the ATP synthase proton channel (5Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Nat.

In the course of this rotation, the γ subunit sequentially interacts with the three αβ pairs in a way that favors ATP synthesis in the catalytic sites, as required by the binding change mechanism (1Boyer P.D.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, null mutations of the δ or γ subunit massively destabilize the mitochondrial genome in the form of 100% cytoplasmic petites, which are cells with a large (>50%) deletion in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 6The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; Δδ, deletion of the S. cerevisiae ATP16 gene, encoding ATP synthase subunit δ; DASPMI, 2-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-1-methylpyridinium iodide; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is an intriguing observation, since many other mutations impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, including a null mutation of the catalytic β subunit of the ATP synthase, have no major effect on the stability of the mitochondrial genome (14Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Defects in the synthesis of the δ or γ subunit were shown to result in isolated mitochondria in a major uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration mediated by partial F1F0 assemblies in which proton translocation is not coupled to ATP synthesis in the F1 (15Xiao Y. Metzl M. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6963-6968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Duvezin-Caubet S. Caron M. Giraud M.-F Velours J. di Rago J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13235-13240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In media containing oligomycin, a specific inhibitor of the ATP synthase assumed to block the enzyme proton channel, mtDNA maintenance could be observed in growing Δδ or Δγ yeast, providing in vivo evidence that an ATP synthase uncoupling may be the cause of the loss of mtDNA in cells unable to properly express the δ or γ subunit (16Duvezin-Caubet S. Caron M. Giraud M.-F Velours J. di Rago J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13235-13240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Mueller D.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, how the ATP synthase uncoupling caused by the absence of the δ or γ subunit destabilizes the mtDNA is still unknown. It has been hypothesized that the loss of the mtDNA allows Δδ or Δγ yeast to survive by eliminating the ATP synthase F0 component, which is in part encoded by the mtDNA (16Duvezin-Caubet S. Caron M. Giraud M.-F Velours J. di Rago J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13235-13240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Mueller D.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The idea is that the F0-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling in Δδ or Δγ yeast would be lethal by preventing essential mitochondrial reactions from occurring. As a consequence, Δδ or Δγ yeast would need to inactivate the ATP synthase proton channel in order to survive. However, in apparent contradiction with this idea, although a lack in the third central stalk subunit (ϵ) also results in a major F0-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling, only partial effects were observed on the mtDNA in Δϵ mutant (18Guelin E. Chevallier J. Rigoulet M. Guerin B. Velours J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, cultures of this mutant usually contain 30% ρ+ cells, showing that retention of functional mtDNA in Δϵ yeast is not lethal. Furthermore, it has been reported that a lack in the δ subunit is viable in Kluyveromyces lactis, a “petite negative” yeast that cannot survive the ρ–/ρ° mutation (19Hansbro P.M. Clark-Walker Chen X. J.G.D. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that destabilization of the mtDNA in Δδ and Δγ S. cerevisiae strains results from an increase in the frequency of the ρ–/ρ° mutation rather than from the impossibility of these mutants surviving when they contain functional mtDNA. Fox and co-workers (20Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have developed elegant approaches for the study of mitochondria based on the insertion into the mtDNA of nonrespiratory genes like ARG8m. This gene is a mitochondrial version of the nuclear ARG8 gene encoding a mitochondrial protein involved in arginine biosynthesis. In this study, we have used ARG8m to better understand why and how a lack in δ subunit destabilizes the mtDNA. To this end, we have inserted ARG8m into a noncoding region of the mitochondrial genome (i.e. keeping intact all of the genes that normally reside in yeast mitochondria). Thus, in a Δarg8 nucleus and in the absence of external arginine, this mtDNA is required not only for respiration but also for arginine biosynthesis. With this system, we clearly show that the ATP synthase proton translocating activity is lethal to yeast cells missing the δ subunit and demonstrate that the ρ–/ρ° mutation is a suppressor allowing survival of Δδ yeast. This is the first report of what we have called a “petite obligate” mutant. We discuss the results in relation with potential mechanisms regulating the assembly of the ATP synthase.

Genetics. 1993; 134: 21-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using standard cloning procedures and two-step PCR strategies (24Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2640) Google Scholar) with pPT24 (containing COX2) and pDS24 (containing ARG8m) (20Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5253-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) as templates, we constructed an EcoRI cassette containing the ARG8m open reading frame precisely flanked on the 5′ side by 143 bp of the COX2 promoter region and on the 3′ side by 119 bp of the COX2 terminator. This ARG8m cassette was inserted into the EcoRI site of pPT24 in the forward orientation to yield plasmid pSDC10. The initial COX2 locus of pPT24 (from 485 bases upstream to 2015 bases downstream of the start codon) is therefore separated in two parts in pSDC10, the region –485 to –285 before the first EcoRI site and the region –285 to +2015 after the ARG8m cassette and the second EcoRI site (see Fig. 1A). The plasmid pSDC10 was introduced by co-transformation with the nuclear selectable LEU2 plasmid pFL46 into the ρ° strain DFS160 by microprojectile bombardment using a biolistic PDS-1000/He particle delivery system (Bio-Rad) as described (25Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 381-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial transformants were identified among the Leu+ nuclear transformants by their ability to produce both respiring and arginine-prototrophic diploid clones when mated to the nonrespiring and arginine auxothrophic NB40-3C strain, bearing deletions in both the mitochondrial COX2 gene (cox2-62) and in the nuclear ARG8 gene. The DNA recombination events leading to the simultaneous integration of ARG8m and COX2 in NB40-3C mtDNA are illustrated in Fig. 1A. One respiratory growth-competent and arginine-prototrophic clone (called SDC12) was retained for further analyses, and the ARG8m integration was verified molecularly by Southern analysis and sequencing. A control diploid strain, SDC15, isogenic to SDC12 but carrying the wild-type mtDNA was constructed by crossing DFS160 with NB80, the COX2 equivalent of NB40-3C (26Bonnefoy N. Fox T.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 262: 1036-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Construction of ARG8m Strains Carrying atp16 (δ) and/or atp4 Disruptions—We first created a diploid strain (SDC13) heterozygous for a null mutation of the ATP synthase δ subunit gene (Δδ), homozygous for a null mutation of ARG8 (Δarg8) and containing the ARG8m mtDNA (Δδ/+Δarg8/Δarg8 [ρ+ ARG8m]), by deleting one of the two δ subunit gene copies in SDC12 with the atp16::KanMX4 cassette described previously (16Duvezin-Caubet S. Caron M. Giraud M.-F Velours J. di Rago J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13235-13240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A Δδ Δarg8 [ρ+ ARG8m] spore derived from SDC13 was converted to ρ° by ethidium bromide treatment (SDC13-14B/60) and crossed with strain SDC16-7C (Δatp4 Δarg8 [ρ+ ARG8m]), a spore derived from the cross of PVY10/60 (Δatp4 ARG8 ρ°) with a spore of SDC12 (SDC12–21A: Δarg8 [ρ+ ARG8m]). The resulting diploid was sporulated to generate the haploid strain SDC17-31B (Δδ Δatp4 Δarg8 [ρ+ ARG8m]). Construction of a Strain Expressing Atp4p and the δ Subunit from Regulatable Promoters—The ATP4 gene from strain BMA64-1B was precisely replaced by the TRP1 marker, using the PCR strategy already described (30Baudin-Baillieu A. Guillemet E. Cullin C. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1997; 13: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One Δatp4 transformant was converted to ρ°, and its mating type was changed using a plasmid-borne HO gene to give YSE15/60. This Δatp4[ρ°] strain was crossed with SDC6, a W303-based Δδ Δarg8 [ρ+ ARG8m] strain containing a plasmid (pSDC13) expressing subunit δ under the control of a doxycycline-repressible promoter (16Duvezin-Caubet S. Caron M. Giraud M.-F Velours J. di Rago J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13235-13240Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The resulting diploid was sporulated, and a Δarg8 Δatp4 Δδ spore containing pSDC13 and the ARG8m mtDNA was isolated (SDC29-10c). This strain was finally transformed with plasmid pSDC20, a pAS24-borne plasmid containing ATP4 cloned as a BamHI-PstI fragment under the control of the GAL10 promoter, to give SDC33.

Oxygen consumption rates were measured with a Clark electrode in the growth medium as described previously (31Rigoulet M. Guerin B.

SDS-PAGE was done according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (33Arselin G. Vaillier J. Graves P.V. Velours J. J. Biol.

Polyclonal antibodies raised against yeast Atp4p, subunit δ, Atp9p, and Atp6p were used after 1:10,000 dilutions, and those against Arg8p were used after a 1:2000 dilution. Nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with peroxidase-labeled antibodies at a 1:10,000 dilution and revealed with the ECL reagent of Amersham Biosciences. Epifluorescence microscopy of DASPMI-stained cells was carried out with a Leica DMRXA microscope fitted with a ×100 immersion objective and a standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. Acetylornithine aminotransferase (Arg8p) is a nuclear encoded mitochondrial protein involved in ornithine and arginine biosynthesis (34Jauniaux J.C. Urrestarazu L.A. Wiame J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Heimberg H. Boyen A. Crabeel M. Glansdorff N. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 90: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although it is normally synthesized in the cytosol and then imported into mitochondria, Fox and co-workers (20Steele D.F. Butler C.A. Fox T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have shown that Arg8p can be synthesized as well directly inside the mitochondrion from a recoded gene, ARG8m, inserted into the mtDNA. In the present study, we have inserted ARG8m in the intergenic region upstream of the COX2 gene, using a protocol described by Mireau et al. (39Mireau H. Arnal N. Fox T.D. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 270: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The ARG8m open reading frame was flanked with the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of COX2 and then integrated into the mtDNA by homologous recombination (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 1A). We have isolated in this way a diploid strain (SDC12) with the expected integration of ARG8m in mtDNA and homozygous for a null mutation in ARG8 (Δarg8/Δarg8 [ρ+ ARG8m]). SDC12 accumulated normal levels of Arg8p (Fig. 1B), grew well on media devoid of arginine, and was respiratory competent (Fig. 1C). As expected, arginine was required for SDC12 to grow in the presence of ethidium bromide, an intercalating agent inducing the loss of mtDNA (Fig. 1C). The mtDNA in SDC12 showed a good stability. Indeed, after about 15 generations in complete 10% glucose (i.e. conditions where arginine biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation are not required for growth), over 98% of the cells were still respiratory competent and arginine-prototrophic. A good mtDNA stability was also observed in SDC12 meiotic segregants. In SDC12, the ARG8m gene is under control of the COX2 5′-untranslated region. Therefore, ARG8m expression should depend on Pet111p, a nucleus-encoded Cox2p translational activator (40Dunstan H.M. Green-Willms N.S. Fox T.D. Genetics. 1997; 147: 87-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Green-Willms N.S. Butler C.A. Dunstan H.M. Fox T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6392-6397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To make sure that this was the case, an SDC12 meiotic segregant (SDC12-4B) was crossed with a ρ° Δpet111 strain (NB151-3C Δarg8 pet111::LEU2), to give SDC3 (Δarg8/Δarg8 Δpet111/+ [ρ+ ARG8m]). All the spores from SDC3 are necessarily Δarg8 and should therefore not grow in media lacking arginine if they cannot express ARG8m. As expected, the ascii usually contained two spores, both respiratory growth-deficient and leucine-prototrophic, as a result of the pet111 deletion (not shown). These spores were also arginine-auxotrophic. Following their transformation with a plasmid-borne wild type PET111 gene, respiratory competence and arginine prototrophy were recovered, demonstrating the requirement for Pet111p to express ARG8m. Elimination of the δ subunit gene in S. cerevisiae always results in 100% ρ–/ρ° populations, and evidence suggests that this conversion into petites is caused by an uncoupling of the ATP synthase (13Giraud M.-F. Velours J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 245: 813-818Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Xiao Y.

Below, we describe experiments we performed with the ARG8m system to determine how this ATP synthase defect impairs mtDNA maintenance. Δδ/+ Yeast Is Genetically Unstable—We first aimed to analyze the segregation of the δ subunit deletion (atp16::KanMX4) and ARG8m markers upon sporulation of SDC13, a diploid heterozygous for the δ deletion, homozygous for Δarg8, and containing the ARG8m mtDNA. It has been reported that diploid strains with a heterozygous mutation in the δ subunit gene (i) have an increased propensity to produce ρ–/ρ° petites (30–40%), (ii) grow slowly on respiratory substrates, and (iii) exhibit partially uncoupled mitochondria, indicating that the reduced δ subunit gene dosage from 2 to 1 has semidominant negative effects (15Xiao Y. Metzl M. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6963-6968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To see whether such defects occurred also in our Δδ/+ SDC13 strain, SDC13 cells were plated for single colonies and incubated for 6 days on glucose plates (Fig. 2). Very small size colonies, probably corresponding to ρ–/ρ° cells were observed, but in a rather limited proportion (less than 10%). Two other distinct types of colonies were observed. One (named SDC13-G), representing about 20% of the population, consisted of grande colonies like those formed by the corresponding wild type (SDC12). The other type (SDC13-I), which was the most frequent (70%), consisted of colonies with an intermediate size, suggesting a reduced but not complete loss of respiratory capacity. In addition, these colonies had a scalloped shape. This trait is typical of strains with an increased propensity to produce ρ–/ρ° petites (47Ephrussi B. Hottinguer H. Chimenes Y. Ann. Inst. Pasteur. 1949; 76: 351-367Google Scholar), but it could also reflect a reduced cell viability. When SDC13-I subclones were plated again for single colonies, a similar colonial heterogeneity was observed, whereas SDC13-G subclones gave essentially grande colonies. Similar observations were made with other, genetically independent, SDC13 isolates (all checked by Southern blot). Sporulation and Tetrad Analysis of Δδ/+ ARG8m Yeast—One SDC13-I subclone and one SDC13-G subclone were sporulated, and tetrads were dissected on rich glucose plates. In the case of SDC13-I, a rather large proportion of the tetrads (42%, n = 40; see Table 2) were incomplete with only two or three viable spores. A lower proportion of incomplete tetrads (20%, n = 20, Table 2) was obtained from SDC13-G. A number of complete tetrads showing a correct segregation of the mating types was analyzed, 11 for SDC13-G and nine for SDC13-I. Geneticin resistance segregated 2:2 in all SDC13-G tetrads. However, only two tetrads showed the expected co-segregation of Geneticin resistance with respiratory growth deficiency. In the nine other SDC13-G tetrads, all spores were respiratory competent. In the case of SDC13-I, four tetrads showed the expected 2:2 co-segregation of Geneticin resistance and respiratory deficiency. In three other tetrads, all spores grew on glycerol and were Geneticin-sensitive. In the remaining two tetrads, Geneticin resistance segregated 2:2, but all spores were respiratory competent.TABLE 2Tetrad analyses of heterozygous Δδ/+ yeastStrainPhenotypes in complete tetradsNumber of analyzed tetrads4 Gly+ G418s2 Gly- G418r 2 Gly+ G418s2 Gly+ G418r 2 Gly+ G418sGly+G418r%%SDC121010010SDC13-I34277339SDC13-G029915011 Open table in a new tab All spores from SDC13 are necessarily Δarg8 and depend therefore on their capacity to remain ρ+ and to express ARG8m in order to proliferate in media lacking arginine. With no exception, all of the spores that were at the same time respiratory deficient and Geneticin-resistant, thus presumably deleted for the δ subunit, were arginine-auxotrophic. Test crosses with a ρ° tester revealed that the early progenies of these spores were entirely composed of ρ–/ρ° cells. Not surprisingly, all of the spores that were respiratory competent were able to grow in media lacking arginine. Tetrads from SDC13-I were also dissected on a glucose medium lacking arginine. Many were incomplete, but this was seen as well, although to a lesser extent, with ascii from the wild type SDC12 strain. It might be that germination on minimal medium is less efficient. However, significantly, none of the SDC13-I spores that germinated in the absence of external arginine was Δδ. Altogether, the results of this first set of experiments indicated that Δδ cells were strictly unable to propagate/express the mtDNA or that they were not viable when th"

Although PLD activity has been proposed to play a role in cytoskeletal rearrangement, the manner in which PLD participates in the rearrangement process remains obscure. In this study, by silencing endogenous PLD isozymes using small interfering RNA in HeLa cells, we demonstrate that endogenous PLD1 is required for the normal organization of the actin cytoskeleton, and, more importantly, for cell motility. PLD1 silencing in HeLa cells resulted in dramatic changes in cellular morphology, including the accumulation of stress fibers, as well as cell elongation and flattening, which appeared to be caused by an increased number of focal adhesions, which ultimately culminated in enhanced cell-substratum interactions. Accordingly, serum-induced cell migration was profoundly inhibited by PLD1-silencing. Moreover, the augmented cell substratum interaction and retarded cell migration induced by PLD1-silencing could be restored by the adding back not only of wild type, but also of lipase-inactive PLD1 into knockdown cells. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that endogenous PLD1 is a critical factor in the organization of the actin-based cytoskeleton, with regard to cell adhesion and migration. These effects of PLD1 appear to operate in a lipase activity-independent manner. We also discuss the regulation of Src family kinases by PLD1, as related to the modulation of Pyk2 and cell migration.

Cell motility is an integral part of a variety of signaling and cytoskeletal processes. Embryonic development, angiogenesis, wound healing, and tumor metastasis all require cell motility (1Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T.

This group of compounds is linked to the extracellular matrix, as well as a host of structural and regulatory molecules on the cytoplasmic side (2Wehrle-Haller B. Imhof B. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 382-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Directional cell migration requires not only the generation of driving forces on existing contacts, but also the dynamic detachment of old contacts, to retract the trailing portion of the cell, and the re-establishment of new contacts, to establish subsequent cycles of force generation. Basically, the formation of FA is initiated by the ligation of integrins to their cognate extracellular matrices (3Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Integrin family receptors lack apparent enzyme activity, and it is believed that the focal adhesion kinases (FAK), members of the cytosolic tyrosine kinase family which includes FAK and Pyk2 (also known as CAKβ/RAFTK), function in the relaying of integrin signaling (4Parsons J.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). The regulation of FAK members is mediated largely by tyrosine phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. Activated FAK kinases phosphorylate the tyrosine residues of their respective substrates, inducing the formation of FA (4Parsons J.T. J.

Mammalian phospholipase D (PLD) comprises two homologous isozymes, which have been designated PLD1 and PLD2, which exhibits distinct regulation and cellular localization (8Frohman M.A. Sung T.C.

PLD is activated rapidly by a variety of extracellular stimuli, and then generates phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline from phosphatidylcholine (11Exton J.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

PLD activity has also been implicated in a broad range of cellular physiological phenomena, including vesicular trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangement (13Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. Curr.

In one such study, the spreading of adenocarcinoma cells was inhibited by treatment with n-butyl alcohol, which has been shown to inhibit PA generation (16Aguirre Ghiso J.A. Farias E.F. Alonso D.F.

A recent study suggested the involvement of PLD2-derived PA in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate generation, in conjunction with ARF6 in the lamellipodial region of HeLa cells (18Honda A. Nogami M. Yokozeki T. Yamazaki M. Nakamura H. Watanabe H. Kawamoto K. Nakayama K. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Kanaho Y.

PLD1 activity has additionally been shown to be involved in lysophosphatidic acid-induced stress fiber formation in fibroblast cell lines (19Kam Y. Exton J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 12: 4055-4066Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although these studies suggested possible roles for PLD catalytic activity in the actin-based cytoskeleton, many of the conclusions in these studies were predicated on the use of relatively nonspecific inhibitors, such as primary alcohols, or dealt with PLD overexpression, which can induce nonspecific or non-physiological cell responses. Here, we present direct evidence of PLD involvement in cytoskeletal changes, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. The silencing of PLD1 in HeLa cells induced dramatic changes in cell morphology, and increased Pyk2 and RhoA activation levels, resulting in increased focal adhesion formation. These changes were directly linked to the strength of cell-substratum interactions, and culminated in defective cell migration. We also have identified a novel PLD1 function, which operates in a lipase-independent fashion in these events. Although the detailed molecular processes underlying these phenomena are not presented in this article, we suggest that Src family kinases are the vicinal targets of PLD1.

RNA Interference—Pairs of 21-nucleotide sense and antisense RNA oligomers were chemically synthesized and annealed by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The oligonucleotides for PLD1 were as follows: sense, 5′-AAG GUG GGA CGA CAA UGA GCA-3′, and antisense, 5′-UGC UCA UUG UCG UCC CAC CUU-3′, which corresponded to human PLD1a coding nucleotides 1455–1475.

All siRNA sequences were subjected to BLAST searches against the NCBI data base, and complete matches were found only in the respective PLD1 or PLD2 sequences. Luciferase GL2 duplex was purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc., and was used as a negative control. Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. HeLa cells were routinely maintained in a humidified chamber at a 5% CO2 atmosphere, in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). Synthetic siRNAs (20 nm duplex) were introduced using METAFECTENE™ reagent (Biontex) in the presence of serum, per manufacturer's instructions. One day after siRNA introduction, cells were detached from the culture dishes and replated onto either normal culture dishes or collagen I-coated glass coverslips, then cultured for an additional 48 h to achieve PLD silencing. Wild-type rat PLD1b expressing vector was constructed as previously reported (21Kim Y. Han J.M. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Oh Y.S. Chung C. Lee T.G. Kim J.H. Park S.K. Yoo J.S. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10344-10351Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Generation of lipase-inactive rat PLD1 (K898R) was prepared as described earlier (22Sung T.C. Roper R.L. Zhang Y. Rudge S.A. Temel R. Hammond S.M. Morris A.J. Moss B. Engebrecht J. Frohman M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4519-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Wild-type version PLD2 (23Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Han J.M. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) were generated, as previously reported (K758R). Human c-Src expressing vector was constructed as described earlier (24Hur E.M. Park Y.S. Lee B.D. Jang I.H. Kim H.S. Kim T.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Kim K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5852-5860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For the adding back of wild-type or lipase-inactive rat PLD1 (K898R), 1 day after the introduction of siRNA, the cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of DNA/35-mm dish of either vector, or vector harboring PLD1 constructs using Lipofectamine Plus™ reagent (Invitrogen) in the presence of serum, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Indirect Immunofluorescence—After transfection, HeLa cells were replated onto glass coverslips coated with collagen I (1 h, 20 μg/ml), and cultured for an additional 48 h. The cells were then washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed twice with PBS, and blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 1% horse serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature. In order to visualize F-actin, the cells were then incubated with Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin for 1 h at room temperature, and washed four times with PBS. To visualize focal adhesions and phosphotyrosyl-proteins, permeabilized cells were incubated with either anti-paxillin antibody (1/200) or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (1/200) diluted in PBS containing 1% horse serum, respectively, for 90 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed four times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1/200) for 60 min at room temperature. After four washings with PBS, cells were analyzed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope imaging system (Zeiss LSM 510) under constant threshold settings, and built-up images were constructed. Lysate Preparation and Immunoblotting—After silencing, the HeLa cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed by brief sonication in lysis buffer A (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium cholate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride). Equal amounts of total cell lysates were then resolved via SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting as previously reported (23Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Han J.M. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-dependent enhanced chemiluminescence. Densitometric analyses were carried out using the Fuji Image Gauge V3.12 program. RhoA Pulldown Assay—GTP-bound RhoA was measured by pulldown with glutathione S-transferase fused to the RhoA binding domain of Rhotekin, GST-RBD (25Zondag G.C. Evers E.E. ten Klooster J.P. Janssen L. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 775-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). After silencing, HeLa cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2. Cells were lysed by gentle homogenization using a 1-ml syringe needle in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) at 4 °C. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g, for 15 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of supernatant were incubated with 25 μg of freshly prepared GST-RBD for 30 min at 4 °C. After this incubation, the resulting pellets were washed three times with extraction buffer. All procedures were performed with in 2 h in order to minimize the spontaneous hydrolysis of RhoA-bound GTP. GST-RBD-bound RhoA was released by boiling in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. Cell Detachment Assay—The adhesion strength of the cells was assessed via a trypsin sensitivity assay, as previously described (26Inagaki K. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horikawa T. Fukunaga K. Tsuda M. Ichihashi M. Kasuga M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After silencing, confluent HeLa cells in 24 well culture plates were treated with 0.005% trypsin in Mg2+ and Ca2+-free PBS for the indicated times at 37 °C. Detached cells were then discarded by washing twice with DMEM. Adherent cells were incubated with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 min, and the number of adherent cells was evaluated by MTT reduction analysis. Cells without trypsin treatment were processed in the same manner, and the MTT value obtained from those cells was used as a measure of total cell number. Cell detachment was calculated by subtracting the MTT value of adherent cells after trypsin treatment from the MTT-value of total cells without trypsin treatment. Cell Migration—The migration of the HeLa cells was monitored by a modified Boyden chamber migration assay, using an 8-μm pore CHEMOTX filter plate coated with collagen I (1 h, 20 μg/ml). HeLa cells transfected with siRNA were detached with trypsin, and washed twice with DMEM containing 10% serum. 3.5 × 104 cells were loaded onto each well, and the lower chamber was filled with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were allowed to migrate for 5 h at 37 °C. At the end of the experiment, non-migrating cells were removed with cotton swabs. The migrated cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes) to visualize the nuclei of the migrated cells. The migrated cells were then counted under a fluorescence microscope at a total magnification of ×200. Cell migration was evaluated by averaging the number of migrated cells/4 random fields from each well in triplicate experiments. Measurement of PLD Activity—PLD activity was assayed by measuring the formation of phosphatidylbutyl alcohol (PBtOH), the product of PLD-mediated transphosphatidylation, in the presence of 1-butyl alcohol as described previously (23Lee S.D. Lee B.D. Han J.M. Kim J.H. Kim Y. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with slight modification. After 8 h of serum deprivation, the cells were labeled with [3H]myristic acid (5 μCi/2 × 106 cells) for 4 h. Unincorporated [3H]myristic acid was removed by washing twice with DMEM. The cells were then treated with fresh medium containing 10% serum for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1-butyl alcohol (0.4%, v/v). Cellular lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol/1 M NaCl (1:1:1, v/v/v). PBtOH was separated from total lipids with ethyl acetate/trimethylpentane/acetic acid (9/5/2, v/v/vol) in a Silica gel 60 TLC plate. The amounts of labeled PBtOH, and total lipids were determined with a Fuji BAS-2000 image analyzer (Tokyo, Japan). Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were transfected with 0.5 μg/35-mm dish of vector containing human c-Src cDNA and 2 μg/35-mm dish of vector or vector harboring various PLD constructs. After 36 h of incubation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, harvested, and lysed in lysis buffer B (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium cholate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride). Insoluble debris was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g, for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of PLD antibody and protein A-Sepharose bead. After 5 h of incubation at 4 °C, the resulting pellets were washed four times with lysis buffer B, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblotting. Statistical Analysis—Data are represented as means (±S.D.). Statistical comparisons were carried out using Student's paired t tests, unless otherwise indicated. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Cellular Morphology Changes by PLD1 Knockdown in HeLa Cells—To ascertain the physiological roles of PLD, we designed siRNA for human PLD1 and PLD2, and attempted to silence endogenous PLD isozymes in the HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, HeLa cells express both PLD isozymes, as was revealed by exposure to pan-PLD antibody. The designed siRNAs successfully reduced PLD1 and PLD2 expression levels. The expression level of PLD1 diminished to about <10% of the control level, and the PLD2 expression level was reduced to about <20–30% of the control level within 72 h of RNA interference. The siRNAs appeared to be specific, as no other gene products were found, by BLAST search, to match the siRNA sequences (data not shown). Furthermore, no cross-reactions by siRNAs were observed with other PLD isoforms (Fig. 1A). The knockdown of PLD proteins resulted in reduced PLD activity, as was revealed by the transphosphatidylation reaction product, phosphatidylbutyl alcohol, in the presence of 1-butyl alcohol (Fig. 1B). The data additionally suggest that, whereas PLD2 is expressed in smaller amount than is PLD1, PLD2 isozyme contributes the majority of PLD activity upon serum stimulation in these cells. During these experiments, we also observed dramatic morphological changes as the result of PLD1-silencing (Fig. 1C). As compared with the control siRNA-transfected cells, the PLD1-siRNA transfected cells exhibited more elongated and flattened phenotypes, resulting in increased cellular area (Fig. 1D). Whereas the control siRNA-transfected cells exhibited relatively well-defined cellular margins, the PLD1-siRNA transfected cells occasionally exhibited flattened cell shapes, often with barely discernable cellular margins. From these results, we concluded that endogenous PLD1 is fundamentally involved in the maintenance of cellular morphology. Increased Number of Focal Adhesions and Enhanced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Pyk2 by PLD1 Knockdown—Because PLD has been implicated in actin-based cytoskeletal rearrangement (17Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and cellular morphology is generally regulated by cytoskeletal structures such as filamentous actin (F-actin) and FAs, we evaluated the FA structures occurring in PLD1-knockdown cells by paxillin immunostaining. As shown in Fig. 2A, as compared with the control or PLD2-knockdown cells, PLD1-knockdown cells exhibited enlarged cell shapes, with concomitant increases in FA-like paxillin staining. When we measured the paxillin-positive FA structures in those cells, we observed an ∼2-fold increase in their number as the result of PLD1-silencing (Fig. 2B). In cultured cells, tyrosine-phosphorylations are normally concentrated at FA sites, and appear to regulate FA formation (27Yamada K.M. Miyamoto S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 28Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the levels of phosphotyrosyl proteins in the PLD1-knockdown cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, increased tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in the PLD1-knockdown cells. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins with molecular masses of 100–130 kDa and 68 kDa were also observed in PLD1-knockdown cells. Immunofluorescence staining of phosphotyrosine by specific antibody, coupled with Rhodamine-phalloidin staining, resulted in a punctuate phosphotyrosine staining pattern along the stress fibers, which resembled FA staining in these cells (data not shown). The concentrated pattern of phosphotyrosine in these FA-like structures led us to examine the phosphorylation levels of the FA regulatory proteins. Using site-specific phosphoantibodies, we discovered that the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Tyr-402) and paxillin (Tyr-118) was augmented more than 2-fold by PLD1-silencing (Fig. 2, D and E). Activation of RhoA and Augmentation of Stress Fibers by PLD1 Silencing—The generation and maturation of FA also require the activity of RhoA, one of the Rho family small GTPases, which has been implicated in stress fiber generation (29Barry S.T. Flinn H.M. Humphries M.J. Critchley D.R. Ridley A.J. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1997; 4: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). As PLD1 silencing induced flattened cellular morphology (Fig. 1C and 2A), and increased stress fibers might result in flattened cell morphology, we examined the cellular F-actin structures in the PLD-knockdown cells. As expected, the knockdown of PLD1 resulted in profound stress fiber generation (Fig. 3A). PLD1-knockdown cells also exhibited different F-actin structures. Whereas the F-actin in control cells was concentrated in the cellular margin and perinuclear punctuate structures, the F-actin in the PLD1-knockdown cells was found to be primarily incorporated into concentrated cytosolic stress fibers. In contrast to the fragmented stress fibers observed in the control cells, many of the PLD1-knockdown cells evidenced stress fiber which traversed the entire length of the cell. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, these changes in the F-actin structures were well correlated with the enhanced levels of RhoA signaling (GTP-bound RhoA and phosphorylation of cofilin). Taken together, these results suggest that the morphological changes observed in the PLD1-knockdown cells might be attributable to the increased activation of Pyk2 and RhoA. Increased Strength of Cell-Substratum Interaction and Defective Cell Migration by PLD1 Silencing—The morphological changes induced by PLD1-knockdown include intense stress fibers and FA structures (Figs. 2 and 3). Therefore, we subsequently attempted to determine whether or not these changes are directly involved in the strength of cell-substratum interactions, by measuring the detachment sensitivity of the cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, PLD1 knockdown results in diminished cell detachment, compared with that observed in the control cells. This suggests that the regulation of Pyk2 and RhoA by PLD1 is directly linked to the strength of the cell-substratum interactions occurring in these cells. The hyperactivation of FAK family proteins and RhoA, as well as increased cellular attachment to the substratum, is occasionally linked to defects in cellular motility (31Angers-Loustau A. Cote J.F.

To more definitively verify our hypothesis regarding the role of PLD1 in cytoskeletal activity, we attempted to ascertain whether or not PLD1-mediated effects are directly linked to cellular motility. As shown in Fig. 4B, cellular migration was profoundly inhibited by PLD1 knockdown. Taken together, these results s"

Its molecular mass is ∼50 kDa, and the predicted structure that is derived from hydrophobicity analysis contains either seven or nine transmembrane domains (1Hallén S. Brande′n M. Dawson P.A.

In the current study, to further identify the functionally relevant residues critical for transport, thirteen conserved negatively (Asp (D) and Glu (E)) and positively (Lys (K) and Arg (R)) charged residues plus Cys-270 of rat Asbt (rAsbt) were selected, and their roles in transport function and membrane localization were examined by a combination of molecular biological, biochemical, and electrophysiological methods.

Potential functional determinant residues were mutated by site-specific mutagenesis using rat Asbt-GFP as template. The QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to convert codons for potential active determinant residues to alanine or glutamine residues according to the manufacturer's directions with minor modification as described previously (5Sun A.Q.

Transfected cells were harvested 24–48 h later for bile acid transport and confocal microscopy analysis. Confocal microscopy was carried out as described previously (7Sun A.Q. Ananthanarayanan M. Soroka C.J. Thevananther S. Shneider B.L. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol.,. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confocal microscopy was performed on a confluent monolayer of transfected cells cultured on glass coverslips. The cells were fixed and permeabilized for 7 min in 100% methanol at –20 °C, followed by rehydration in phosphate-buffered saline. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells on coverslips were inverted onto a drop of VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Fluorescence was examined with a Leica TCS-SP (UV) 4-channel confocal laser scanning microscope in the Imaging Core Facility Microscopy Center, Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Bile Acid Influx Transport Assay and Inhibition Study—The Na+-dependent taurocholate (TC) influx assay was done as described previously (4Sun A.Q. Arrese M.A. Zeng L. Swaby I. Zhou M.M. Suchy F.J. J.

Physiol.,. 1998; 275: G1045-G1055PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, taurocholate uptake was performed at 37 °C for 10 min. The confluent cell monolayers grown on 12-well plates were washed twice with warm uptake buffer (116 mm NaCl (or choline), 5.3 mm KCl, 1.1 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 11 mm d-glucose, 10 mm Hepes, at pH 7.4), and each well was incubated with uptake buffer containing 10 μm [3H]taurocholate at the final concentrations. Following 10 min of incubation, the influx assays were terminated by aspirating the medium, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold uptake buffer. The levels of protein expression of wild-type and various mutated transporters in transfected cells were normalized by total protein concentrations. The protein was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. In the bile acid and non-bile acid organic anion inhibition studies, taurocholate influx of wild-type or mutant rAsbt-GFP cDNA-transfected cells in the absence of competitor was set as 100%, and all values were graphed relative to this level. The final concentration of each inhibitor was 100 μm or as indicated in the figure legends. Kinetic Characterization of GFP-fused Wild-type and Mutant Rat Asbt—Apparent Km and Vmax values for taurocholic acid were obtained by measuring initial rates of uptake at varying concentrations (1, 5, 10, 50, 100 μm) of taurocholic acid substrate. The sodium concentration was kept constant at 116 mm. The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression with the enzyme kinetic software Enzfitter for MS-DOS. Membrane Biotinylation Analysis—rAsbt-GFP and mutant cell surface expression was detected essentially as described by Ho et al. (8Ho R.H. Leake B.F. Roberts R.L. Lee W. Kim R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7213-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS-7 cells were grown on 6-well plates and transfected with rAsbt-GFP and mutants using a similar protocol for transport experiments. Sixteen hours post-transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline Ca2+/Mg2+ (138 mm NaCl2, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 9.6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.3) and then treated with a membrane-impermeable biotinylating agent (sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin, 1.5 mg/ml; Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequently the cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline Ca2+/Mg2+ containing 100 mm glycine and then incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with the same buffer to remove the remaining labeling agent. After washing, cells were disrupted with 700 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris base, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 1 h with constant agitation. Following centrifugation, 140 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) was added to 600 μl of cell lysate and incubated overnight in a cold room. Beads were washed four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, and the biotinylated proteins were released by incubation of the beads with 2× Laemmli buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Similar to total cell lysates, samples of the biotinylated fractions (25 μl) were subjected to Western analysis for detection of immunodetectable rAsbt-GFP and mutants with polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:2000 dilution). The protein concentration was normalized to the amount of actin protein detected by an anti-actin antibody (1:5000). Oocyte Expression and Electrophysiological Experiments—Oocyte culture and current-voltage analysis were performed as described previously (9Chen H.J. Sesti F. Goldstein S.A.N. Biophysical J. 2003; 84: 3679-3689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis frogs, defolliculated by collagenase treatment. On the following day, they were microinjected with 46 nl of sterile water containing 5 ng of rAsbt-GFP or mutant cRNA per oocyte in standard experiments. Whole-oocyte currents were measured by two-electrode voltage clamp after 4 days of cRNA injection (Oocyte Clamp; Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) with constant perfusion (1 ml/min, solution exchange s). Data were sampled at 1 kHz and filtered at 0.25 kHz. All experiments were performed at room temperature and repeated with at least two branches of oocytes. Standard bath solution was ND-96 (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.3 CaCl2, and 5 HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5. Statistics Analysis—The results were expressed as mean value ± S.E. and analyzed by using unpaired t test and one-way analysis of variance to test for a difference in means between two groups that may have unequal sizes. The p values were adjusted by Bonferroni correction to deal with multiple comparison. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Effects of Site-directed Mutagenesis on Initial Rate of Taurocholate Transport by rAsbt-GFP—Previous studies on bile acid-binding proteins and sodium-coupled cotransporters (10Zahner D. Eckhardt U. Petzinger E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) indicated that charged amino acids of these proteins may be critical as binding sites for sodium ions and the cotransported substrate. The negatively charged residues Asp-115 (located in the large intracellular loop 3) and Glu-257 (located in the large extracellular loop 6) of rat Ntcp have been identified as being important for bile acid transport activity (10Zahner D. Eckhardt U. Petzinger E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, Zahner et al. (10Zahner D. Eckhardt U. Petzinger E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) suggested that Cys-266 of rat Ntcp, which is located in the large extracellular loop 6, is involved in taurocholate transport. The importance of the conserved charged residues of Asbt is not fully understood, especially the conserved positively charged residues. In this study, we selected eleven positively charged residues, two negatively charged residues, Asp-122 (Asp-115 in liver Ntcp) and Glu-261 (Glu-257 in liver Ntcp), and Cys-270 (Cys-266 in liver Ntcp) of rat Asbt to examine their potential functional importance. An alignment (Fig. 1) of the amino acid sequences of five Asbt proteins from rat, mouse, hamster, rabbit, and human reveals that these fourteen selected residues are conserved in all five species. Because GFP is easily detected and has been shown not to interrupt transport activity, cellular distribution, and protein stability of bile acid transporters (4Sun A.Q. Arrese M.A. Zeng L. Swaby I.

The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was used to convert codons for the charged amino acids of interest and Cys (C) to non-charged alanine (A) or glutamine (Q). The wild type and mutants of rAsbt-GFP were then expressed in COS-7 cells, and the initial rate of taurocholate uptake was examined. Fig. 2 shows that the initial rate of TC transport was significantly reduced in cells transfected with nine of the rAsbt-GFP thirteen mutants. Taurocholate transport activity decreased by 85–90% in the cells transfected with D122A, R256Q, E261A, and double mutated K312Q,K313Q (KK313QQ) mutants. K191Q- and K225Q-transfected cells showed an ∼80% decrease in transport activity and K57Q, R64Q, and R254A showed ∼35–55% decrease in transport activity compared with wild-type rat Asbt-GFP. Mutations of Lys-150, Lys-185, and Lys-189 of rAsbt-GFP caused no significant change in transport activity compared with wild-type rat Asbt-GFP. In contrast, replacement of Cys-270 with Ala enhanced the TC transport activity >20% compared with wild-type rAsbt-GFP-transfected cells. Kinetic Analysis of rAsbt-GFP and Mutants—A decrease in transport activity after a single amino acid mutation may be caused by a change in substrate binding affinity and/or in membrane distribution of the transport protein (4Sun A.Q.

Therefore, we next evaluated the kinetic parameters (apparent Km) of Na+-dependent taurocholate uptake of wild-type and mutant rAsbt-GFP in transfected COS-7 cells. Initial rates of [3H]taurocholate accumulation in COS-7 cells were measured at varying concentrations of taurocholic acid as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data were fitted by nonlinear regression to the Michaelis-Menten equation. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 3, the wild-type rAsbt-GFP had a Km value for taurocholate transport of 26.3 ± 8.3 μm, which is comparable with the previously reported Km values of 12–37 μm in studies of rat ileal brush-border membrane vesicles and Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human or hamster Asbt (14Alrefai W.A.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6743-6750Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These studies showed that fusion with GFP did not significantly affect taurocholate binding affinity of rAsbt. As shown in Table 1, the Km values of D122A, K191Q, R256Q, E261A, and K312Q,K313Q (KK313QQ) mutants were increased 3∼6-fold compared with wild-type Asbt-GFP. The Km values of R64Q and K225Q mutants were increased ∼2.5-fold compared with wild-type rAsbt-GFP. The apparent Km values for K150Q, K185Q, and K189Q mutants were similar to that of wild-type rAsbt-GFP. Furthermore, corresponding experiments comparing the wild-type and C270A mutant of rAsbt-GFP revealed no significant change in Km value for taurocholate transport. However, the increased initial rate of taurocholate uptake by the C270A mutant appears to be due to in an increased Vmax (C270A = 164.9 ± 4.8 pmol/mg/min versus WT = 129.0 ± 6.3 pmol/mg/min) for the transport process. These data suggest that the decrease of initial TC transport activity of the mutants is due to altered substrate binding affinity.TABLE 1Kinetic analysis of taurocholate uptake in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant rAsbt-GFPrAsbt-GFPWild TypeK57QR64Q*D122A*K150QK185QK189QKm (μm)26.3 ± 8.349.2 ± 8.565.7 ± 7.298.8 ± 8.036.6 ± 5.140.8 ± 4.639.9 ± 12.2Vmax (pmol/mg/min)129.0 ± 6.341.4 ± 6.8*43.0 ± 9.137.2 ± 7.5120.9 ± 9.3137.8 ± 6.0130.6 ± 18.4rAsbt-GFPK191Q*K225Q*R254AR256Q*E261A*C270AKK313QQ*Km (μm)146.4 ± 19.672.5 ± 6.850.7 ± 7.1102.3 ± 12.0178.6 ± 2423.9 ± 2.4111.3 ± 12.8Vmax (pmol/mg/min)57.5 ± 6.935.1 ± 1.793.1 ± 12.0*36.1 ± 7.553.2 ± 9.4164.9 ± 4.8*43.3 ± 4.2 Open table in a new tab Cellular Distribution of Rat Asbt Mutants in Transfected Cells—To define the potential effects of point mutations on the cellular distribution of rAsbt, mutated rAsbt-GFPs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. The plasma membrane distributions of these mutants were visualized by confocal microscopy. The confocal images demonstrated that plasma membrane expression of these mutated proteins in transfected COS-7 (Fig. 4) cells was similar to wild-type rAsbt-GFP. Quantitative plasma membrane biotinylation analysis further confirmed these results. Fig. 5 shows no significant differences in cell surface protein expression between the mutants and wild-type rAsbt-GFP-transfected COS-7 cells. Therefore, we conclude that the altered transport activities of these mutants were not due to synthesis and trafficking defects but to mutation-induced changes in the affinity of Asbt for taurocholate.FIGURE 5Membrane biotinylation analysis of rAsbt-GFP and mutants expressed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells. A, transfected COS-7 cells were grown on 6-well plates. Sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-SS-biotin was added into the plates. After extraction, the biotinylated rAsbt-GFP and mutants were analyzed by Western blotting. The rAsbt-GFP and mutants were detected by a specific anti-GFP antibody (upper panel). The protein concentration was normalized to the amount of actin protein detected by an anti-actin antibody (lower panel).

To understand whether these selected charged residues determine substrate binding specificity, cholate, taurodeoxycholate (TDC), taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC), taurodehyrocholate (TDHC), and lithocholic acid (LCA) were used as inhibitors in these experiments. These bile acids, differing in the number and position of hydroxyl groups in the steroid nucleus and conjugation with taurine group, were used to map potential ligand-carrier protein-interacting sites in wild-type and mutant transporters (see “Discussion”). As shown in Fig. 6, taurocholate uptake by wild-type rAsbt-GFP was significantly inhibited by 10 min of exposure to cholate, TCDC, TDC, and lithocholic acid, but not by TDHC. These results agree with previous studies by Kramer et al. (18Kramer W. Stengelin S. Baringhaus K-H. Enhsen A. Heuer H. Becker W. Corsiero D. Girbig F. Noll R. Weyland C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1604-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 6, the inhibition by TCDC (absence of 12α-OH group) on the taurocholate transport was almost abolished by mutation of D122A, R256Q, E261A, and K312Q,K313Q (KK313QQ) and was also significantly decreased by K191Q, K225Q, and R254A mutants compared with wild-type rAsbt-GFP. Similar to the effects of TCDC, the inhibition of taurocholate transport by TDC (absence of 7α-OH group) was also significantly decreased in the K225Q, R256Q, E261A, and K312Q,K312Q mutants. In contrast, taurocholate transport by all of the mutants was inhibited to the same degree as wild-type rAsbt-GFP by cholate, lithocholic acid, and TDHC. These results suggest that residues Asp-122, Lys-191, Lys-225, Arg-254, Arg-256, Glu-261, and Lys-312,Lys-313 may be important for substrate binding specificity. Asp-122, Lys-191, and Arg-254 may interact with the 7α-hydroxyl group of bile acids (see “Discussion”). Effects of Non-bile Acid Organic Anions on Taurocholate Uptake by COS-7 Cells Transfected with rAsbt-GFP Mutants—The ileal Na+-dependent bile acid carrier exhibits wide substrate specificity and may be inhibited by many cholephilic organic substances of high structural diversity through competitive or non-competitive interactions (19Swaan P.W.

Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 123: 47-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further identify functionally relevant residues that may determine substrate specificity, we investigated the effects of five structurally different non-bile acid organic anions on taurocholate transport in COS-7 cells transfected with the cDNAs of rAsbt-GFP and mutated transporters. Fig. 7 shows that bromosulfothalein (BSP), bumetanide (BUM), and diisothiocyanostilbene disulfonate (DIDS) significantly inhibited [3H]taurocholate uptake by wild-type rAsbt-GFP-transfected cells, whereas estron-3-sulfate (E3S) and probenecid had no effect. These results are in agreement with the previous studies except for DIDS, which has been reported to inhibit rabbit Ntcp but not rabbit Asbt (18Kramer W. Stengelin S. Baringhaus K-H. Enhsen A. Heuer H. Becker W. Corsiero D. Girbig F. Noll R. Weyland C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1604-1617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows the BSP inhibition of taurocholate uptake is enhanced by >50% in D122A mutant transfected cells. In cells transfected with R64A, K191Q, K225Q, R256Q, E261A, and K312Q,K313Q mutants, the inhibition of taurocholate influx by BSP was also increased by 20–30%. The inhibition of [3H]taurocholate transport by the other non-bile acid organic anions tested (BUM, DIDS, E3S, and probenecid) was not significantly changed in cells transfected with mutants compared with wild-type rAsbt-GFP-transfected cells. Electrophysiological Analysis of Substrate-dependent Currents in the Xenopus Oocytes Expressing Wild-type and Mutant rAsbt-GFP—Previous studies indicated that the Na+-dependent bile acid cotransport process is electrogenic with a substrate binding site composed of a closely positioned negatively charged group that interacts with a single sodium ion (10Zahner D. Eckhardt U. Petzinger E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1117-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Weinman S.A. Carruth M.W. Dawson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34691-34695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, because of technical difficulties, so far there has been no direct evidence of electrical currents generated from bile acid and Na+ movement by Asbt. To further understand the mechanism of Na+/bile acid cotransport, we examined the relationship between electrical and chemical driving forces of rAsbt in the Xenopus oocyte expression system, which is widely used to study structure and function of ion channels, receptors, and transporters. First, the surface expression of rAsbt-GFP and mutants in the Xenopus oocytes was examined by confocal microscopy. The results show that the wild-type and mutant rAsbt-GFP proteins were expressed on the cell membrane of oocytes and no GFP fluorescence was observed in non-injected oocytes (data not shown). The whole-oocyte currents were then obtained before and after application of 1 mm taurocholate with a family of test voltage pulses to the oocyte. The taurocholate-induced currents were obtained from the current difference in the absence and presence of taurocholate at each test voltage. In Fig. 8A, whole-oocyte family currents in non-injected oocytes showed no measurable voltage-dependent current changes before and after application of 1 mm taurocholate. In contrast, application of 1 mm taurocholate significantly increased whole-cell currents in oocytes expressing wild-type rAsbt-GFP (Fig. 8B). The taurocholate-induced currents were measured in the same way for the rAsbt-GFP mutants. Interestingly, a small fraction of whole-oocyte current was detected from oocytes expressing rAsbt-GFP even without application of taurocholate (Fig. 8B, left panel), suggesting that Na+ ions are able to move and bind"

RNA viruses were thought not to display anti-apoptotic activities, as their spread appears to benefit from a rapid induction of cell death. Here, we report an antiapoptotic activity in the Picornavirus Coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4). CVB4 infection of HeLa cells induced negligible apoptosis over a period of 10 h. However, infected cells developed resistance to drug-induced apoptosis using staurosporine and actinomycin D and to death receptor-induced apoptosis using tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Despite this resistance, the apoptotic machinery was nonetheless fully activated in these drug-treated infected cells because the levels of pro-caspase-3 processing to its active form were similar to control cells. However, the DEVDase (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp protease) activity of the processed caspase was significantly inhibited in the virus-infected staurosporine-treated cells compared with drug treatment alone. Likewise, extracts of CVB4-infected cells suppressed recombinant caspase-3 activity in vitro. Immunoprecipitation of activated caspase-3 from radiolabeled virus-infected cells revealed the co-precipitation of a 48-kDa protein that was tentatively identified as viral protein 2BC. Recombinant caspase-3 was found to co-precipitate with virus protein 2BC. Finally, when protein 2BC was expressed in HeLa cells, both staurosporine-induced apoptosis and in vitro caspase-3 DEVDase activity were significantly reduced. Taken together these data imply that CVB4 infection suppresses apoptosis through virus protein 2BC associating with caspase-3 and inhibiting its function. Thus, 2BC is the first reported RNA virus inhibitor of apoptosis protein. Virus infection may induce host cell death by apoptosis, but some DNA viruses are capable of preventing this process.

Members of this family of transmembrane receptors include tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor I, CD95 (also known as Fas or APO-1), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) 3The abbreviations used are: TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; IAP, inhibitors of apoptosis protein; CPE, cytopathic effects; CVB4, Coxsackievirus B4; PI, propidium iodide; AV, annexin V; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ANOVA, analysis of variance; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DEVDase, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp protease.3The abbreviations used are: TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; IAP, inhibitors of apoptosis protein; CPE, cytopathic effects; CVB4, Coxsackievirus B4; PI, propidium iodide; AV, annexin V; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ANOVA, analysis of variance; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DEVDase, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp protease. receptors; activation by their corresponding physiological ligands induces the formation of a complex referred to as the death-inducing signaling complex. Although different in composition between the different death receptors, the death-inducing signaling complex includes adaptor proteins such as FADD or TRADD and cysteine proteases called caspases such as caspase-8. Caspases belong to a family of cysteine proteases comprising at least 12 isoforms in human cells and are located primarily in the cytosol where they exist as inactive zymogens (procaspases), which require proteolytic cleavage for activation. Caspases cleave their target proteins at residues next to Asp, and those involved in apoptosis are organized in a hierarchical structure composed of initiator and executioner caspases that provides great potential for signal amplification (8Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J.Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2139) Google Scholar). The aggregation of the death receptor during activation provides a molecular platform allowing the death-inducing signaling complex to bring initiator procaspases-8 into close proximity and, thus, promote their dimerization and subsequent activation through autocatalytic proteolysis (9Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Active caspase-8 proteolytically processes and activates the executioner procaspases-3 and -7 that in turn are thought to be responsible for the apoptotic demise of the cell. This apoptosis pathway controlled by the death receptor is often referred to as the extrinsic pathway and is responsible for the elimination of unwanted cells during development, immune system development, and immunosurveillance. The second pathway activating apoptosis in mammalian cells is called the intrinsic pathway and involves the mitochondria (3Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6258) Google Scholar, 4Jiang X.J. Wang X.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Stress signals emerging from exposure to cytotoxic drugs, irradiation, genomic damage, but also cross-talk from the extrinsic pathway leads to an increase in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability that is sufficient to allow the release of cytochrome c. This then assembles with Apaf-1 to form a large proapoptotic platform structure known as the apoptosome that also includes the initiator caspase-9. Again, close proximity of several pro-caspase-9 molecules promotes their activation by dimerization and autocatalytic processing (9Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar), and once more this is followed by downstream proteolytic activation of executioner caspases-3 and -7. Both these routes of induction are tightly regulated by a remarkable array of cellular regulatory proteins such as the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) (10Shiozaki E.N. Shi Y.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 486-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), FLIPs (11Thome M. Tschopp J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and Bcl-2 family members (12Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3324) Google Scholar) that control both the activation and the activity of various caspases. Interestingly, many of the cellular regulators of apoptosis were discovered to have structural or functional viral homologues (13Roulston A. Marcellus R.C. Branton P.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 577-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 14Barry M. McFadden G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15O'Brien V. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1833-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to large and slow replicating DNA viruses, where anti-apoptotic viral proteins are thought to benefit the invading organism by preventing premature host cell death, RNA viruses replicate much more efficiently, and their spread appears to benefit from a rapid induction of cell death. The genomes of RNA viruses were, therefore, thought not to encode proteins with anti-apoptotic activity. This assumption, however, seems likely to be incorrect at least in the case of some enteroviruses. Enteroviruses are nonenveloped cytolytic positive-stranded RNA viruses of the Picornaviridae family. They are capable of rapid and cytopathic replication. The cytopathic effects (CPE) induced share characteristics with necrosis (16Agol V.I. Belov G.A. Bienz K. Egger D. Kolesnikova M.S. Raikhlin N.T.

However, in some cell types or environments or when virus replication is inhibited, the virus-triggered cell destruction adopts the apoptotic path, as extensively documented for poliovirus (18Agol V.I.

Lett. 2002; 326: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism responsible for the switch between the two forms of cell death is still poorly understood, but poliovirus has been shown to induce an antiapoptotic activity under conditions of permissive replication and infection that would favor necrosis-like CPE over cell death by apoptosis. Under these conditions the virus opposes the development of actinomycin D-, cycloheximide-, or sorbitol-induced apoptosis (19Tolskaya E.A. Romanova L.I. Kolesnikova M.S. Ivannikova T.A. Smirnova E.A. Raikhlin N.T. Agol V.I. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Koyama A.H. Irie H. Ueno F. Ogawa M. Nomoto A. Adachi A. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 2965-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The identity of the viral protein(s) responsible for this effect and the mechanisms by which they might act remain unknown although the cellular target has been suggested to be located downstream of cytochrome c release (29Belov G.A. Romanova L.I. Tolskaya E.A. Kolesnikova M.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Agol V.I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to investigate whether the closely related Enterovirus, Coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4), is also capable of inducing an antiapoptotic activity in human cells and to define the mechanism of any such activity. Generalized CVB infection is very common, particularly in young children. Although usually silent, it has been associated with several diseases, including severe acute human myocarditis, dilated myocardiopathy, chronic pancreatitis, and aseptic meningitis and encephalitis (25Feuer R. Mena I. Pagarigan R.R. Harkins S. Hassett D.E. Whitton J.L. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1379-1393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 30Huber S. Ramsingh A.I. Vir.

Opin. Cardiol. 2003; 18: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Like other enteroviruses, the CVB4 genome is single positive-stranded RNA of 7.5 kilobases containing one large open reading frame that is translated into a precursor polyprotein that is subsequently processed by proteases to release the functional virus proteins (33Jenkins O. Booth J.D. Minor P.D. Almond J.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1835-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The polyprotein is divided into three functional regions; four capsid proteins, VP1-VP4, are encoded within the P1 region of the genome, whereas the nonstructural proteins involved in replication are encoded within the P2 and P3 regions. Processing of the P2 and P3 regions generates the mature products termed proteins 2Apro, 2B, 2C, 3B, 3A, 3Cpro, and 3Dpol and also some partially processed forms, 2BC, 3AB, and 3CDpro, that are believed to have distinct functions. Here we report that CVB4 infection of HeLa cells confers resistance to induction of apoptosis by a variety of agents, including staurosporine, actinomycin D, and TRAIL. The protection from apoptosis was not mediated by a failure of apoptotic machinery activation but was caused by a binding of the 2BC protein to caspase-3 that resulted in the inhibition of the activity of this execution caspase. Reagents and Antibodies—Staurosporine and soluble human recombinant TRAIL (SuperKillerTRAIL) were purchased from Alexis Corp. Ltd (Nottingham, UK), and actinomycin D and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets and T7 Cap Scribe were purchased from Roche Applied Science. N-Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminofluoromethylcoumarin was obtained from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). An annexin V-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) kit was from Merck, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was from Molecular Probes (Leiden, NL). Phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-caspase-3 (active form) (clone C92–605) and polyclonal anti-active caspase-3 (catalog #557035) were purchased from BD Pharmingen. All secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were bought from Dako Ltd (Cambridge, UK). All restriction enzymes, nuclease-free water, pGEM-3Z, and luciferase DNA template containing a T7 promoter were from Promega (Southampton, UK), and TransMessenger transfection reagent was purchased from Qiagen (Crawley, UK). l-[35S]Methionine (>37 TBq/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All cell culture media and supplements were bought from Invitrogen. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Recombinant active human caspase-3 was a gift from Dr. Don Nicholson (Merck Frosst). Cell Culture and Infection with CVB4—HeLa and buffalo green monkey kidney cell lines were obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Porton Down, UK. Both cell lines were grown at 37 °C in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and nonessential amino acids in an humidified incubator with 5% carbon dioxide, 95% air. CVB4 was propagated in buffalo green monkey kidney cells and stored at –80 °C. The virus titer was routinely determined by plaque assay in buffalo green monkey kidney cells. Subconfluent cultures of HeLa cells were infected with CBV4 at a multiplicity of infection of 15 in growth medium containing 2% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum by allowing the virus to adsorb for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 with gentle rocking at 10-min intervals. The inoculum was then removed, fresh growth medium containing 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum was added, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 to allow the virus to grow as required. Mock infection of cultures was carried out in the same fashion but in the absence of virus. Analysis of Apoptosis and Cell Death—Changes in nuclear morphology were assessed by fixing the cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. The fixed cells were stained with DAPI (10 μg/ml), and nuclear morphology was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptosis was quantitated by counting a minimum of 200 cells. Analysis of phosphatidylserine exposure during apoptosis was performed by flow cytometric analysis of annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide-stained cells (34Koopman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Kuijten G.A.M. Keehnen R.M.J. Pals S.T. Vanoers M.H.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using a Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) (argon laser, excitation wavelength, 488 nm). A minimum of 10,000 events was acquired in list mode while gating the forward and side scatters to exclude cell debris and analyzed in FL-1 and FL-3. Analysis of Pro-caspase Processing and Caspase Activity—The processing of caspase-3 was followed by flow cytometric detection of HeLa cells immunostained for active caspase-3 using the C92–605 monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the active form of caspase-3 but not its pro-form as previously reported and validated against Western blot analysis and in situ caspase-3 activity (35Macanas-Pirard P.

Toms N.J. Eriksson J.E. Kass G.E.N. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 349: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were harvested by trypsin-EDTA dissociation, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed, and then stained with a phycoerythrin conjugated anti-caspase-3 antibody (1:20) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen). Cells were then analyzed using a Beckman Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). A minimum of 10,000 events was acquired in list mode while gating the forward and side scatters to exclude cell debris and analyzed in FL-2 for neo-epitope appearance. For the assessment of caspase-3/-7 (DEVDase) activity, the cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes and infected or treated with apoptosis-inducing compounds as described above. At the indicated time points, the cells were harvested, resuspended in caspase lysis buffer (40 mm sucrose, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0), and freeze-thawed 3 times, and the supernatant was collected (15,000 × g, 30 min). Eighty μg of sample protein was assayed for DEVDase activity with 20 μm N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminofluoromethylcoumarin (λex = 355 nm; λem = 538 nm) in caspase assay buffer (100 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.25) (37Jones R.A. Johnson V.L. Buck N.R. Dobrota M. Hinton R.H. Chow S.C. Kass G.E.N. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1632-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cell extracts were prepared from mock- or virus-infected or transfected cells and combined with recombinant active human caspase-3 (0.3 μg/ml) to investigate the effect of viral proteins on caspase-3 activity. Immunoprecipitation Assays—HeLa cells grown in 35-mm dishes were infected with CVB4 at a multiplicity of infection of 15 in growth medium containing 2% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. After 8 h, the medium was removed, the cells were washed twice with Met-free minimal essential medium (MEM), and the cells were further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with Met-free MEM before supplementation and incubation with l-[35S]methionine (1.1 MBq/ml) for a further 90 min. Under these conditions, the shut-down of cellular protein synthesis by CVB4 infection (38Roberts L.O. Boxall A.J. Lewis L.J. Belsham G.J. Kass G.E.N. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1703-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) causes viral proteins to be the main proteins that are radiolabeled. After washing the cells twice in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/10 ml)), they were scraped into RIPA buffer supplemented with 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, the cells were vortexed, and supernatants were prepared by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). Immunoprecipitation was carried out by incubating supernatant with antibody (1 μl/100 μl of supernatant) for 45 min on ice followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose and a further 1-h incubation on ice with gentle mixing. The Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation, washed 3 times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS before boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved using 12.5 and 15% gels. The viral proteins were visualized by autoradiography on Hyperfilm MP preflashed with a Sensitize Preflash Unit (Amersham Biosciences). Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins using an anti-caspase-3 antibody confirmed that caspase-3 was correctly immunoprecipitated in our experiments. Cloning of CVB4 Proteins 2BC and 2B and Ectopic Expression in HeLa Cells—The coding sequences for 2BC and 2B were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into pGEM-3Z. The sequence was confirmed to be CVB4 2BC and 2B by sequencing. For the transfection and ectopic expression of the viral proteins, pGEM-3Z was linearized with SalI, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated. Copy RNA was generated using T7 Cap Scribe and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by chloroform extraction and precipitated. The RNA pellet was dried and resuspended in nuclease-free water, and its integrity was confirmed by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel. The transfection was carried out using TransMessenger transfection reagent and 4 μg of RNA as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Statistical Analysis of the Data—All data are given as means ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. Comparison of treatments against controls was made using a paired Student's t test or ANOVA using Bonferroni's post-hoc test for multiple comparisons. The significance level chosen for the statistical analysis was p < 0.05. Coxsackievirus B4 Infection of HeLa Cells Confers Resistance to Staurosporine-induced Apoptosis—Infection of HeLa cells with CVB4 did not induce any detectable signs of apoptosis over the first 10 h as demonstrated by a lack of phosphatidylserine exposure, absence of chromatin condensation, and maintained viability (Fig. 1). By this time, only few cells had rounded up as a result of the infection, whereas by 24 h, ∼25% of the cells had rounded up and displayed altered nuclear morphology, but only half of which was typical of apoptosis (round and highly condensed), whereas the others had features of CPE (deformed and elongated nuclei with partial chromatin condensation) (data not shown) (18Agol V.I.

Measurement of annexin V binding showed that the number of apoptotic cells (AV+/PI–) at 24 h was around 5%, which was slightly lower than after 10 h of infection (8 ± 1%) (Fig. 1B), whereas the (secondary) necrotic population (AV+/PI+) had significantly increased. This confirms that CVB4 infection induced a marginal and transient apoptotic response that later in the infection was halted with necrotic-like CPE becoming the predominant form of cell death. As expected, when HeLa cells were treated with the apoptosis-inducing agent staurosporine (0.5 μm), a third of the cell population was clearly apoptotic by 4 h, as evidenced by a significant increase in the number of cells binding fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V (Fig. 1, A and B) and a comparable increase in the number of cells with typical apoptotic nuclei, i.e. displaying condensed and fragmented chromatin (Fig. 1D and Table 1). However, when HeLa cells were infected with CVB4 for 6 h before treatment, there was a significant suppression in the extent of apoptosis induction by staurosporine. The number of cells with phosphatidylserine exposed was reduced from 34.4% ± 3.7 in mock-infected cells treated with staurosporine to 11.3% ± 2.7 in CVB4-infected cells exposed to the inducer of apoptosis (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1, A and B). Likewise, the loss of cell viability (as measured by propidium iodide uptake) was significantly suppressed (Fig. 1, A and B). CVB4 infection prevented the appearance of fragmented chromatin and apoptotic body formation after staurosporine treatment, reducing the population of cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology from 40 ± 2 to 17 ± 1% (p < 0.001) (Table 1). However, many nuclei showed an elongated and somewhat condensed distribution of the chromatin (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data show that the Enterovirus CVB4, like poliovirus (19Tolskaya E.A.

https://openalex.org/W2032392409,"The double Holliday junction (dHJ) is a central intermediate to homologous recombination, but biochemical analysis of the metabolism of this structure has been hindered by the lack of a substrate that adequately replicates the endogenous structure. We have synthesized a novel dHJ substrate that consists of two small, double stranded DNA circles conjoined by two Holliday junctions (HJs). Its biochemical synthesis is based on the production of two pairs of single stranded circles from phagemids, followed by their sequential annealing with reverse gyrase. The sequence between the two HJs is identical on both strands, allowing the HJs to migrate without the generation of unpaired regions of DNA, whereas the distance between the HJs is on the order of gene conversion tracts thus far measured in Drosophila and mouse model systems. The structure of this substrate also provides similar topological constraint as would occur in an endogenous dHJ. Digestion of the dHJ substrate by T7 endonuclease I resolves the substrate into crossover and non-crossover products, as predicted by the Szostak model of double strand break repair. This substrate will greatly facilitate the examination of the mechanism of resolution of double Holliday junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2073982436,"Pyroglutamyl peptidase II (PPII), a highly specific membrane-bound omegapeptidase, removes N-terminal pyroglutamyl from thyrotropin-releasing hormone (<Glu-His-Pro-NH2), inactivating the peptide in the extracellular space. PPII and enzymes with distinct specificities such as neutral aminopeptidase (APN), belong to the M1 metallopeptidase family. M1 aminopeptidases recognize the N-terminal amino group of substrates or inhibitors through hydrogen-bonding to two conserved residues (Gln-213 and exopeptidase motif Glu-355 in human APN), whereas interactions involved in recognition of pyroglutamyl residue by PPII are unknown. In rat PPII, the conserved exopeptidase residue is Glu-408, whereas the other one is Ser-269. Given that variations in M1 peptidase specificity are likely due to changes in the catalytic region, we constructed three-dimensional models for the catalytic domains of PPII and APN. The models showed a salt bridge interaction between PPII-Glu-408 and PPII-Lys-463, whereas the equivalent APN-Glu-355 did not participate in a salt bridge. Docking of thyrotropin-releasing hormone in PPII model suggested that the pyroglutamyl residue interacted with PPII-Ser-269. According to our models, PPII-S269Q and -K463N mutations should leave Glu-408 in a physicochemical context similar to that found in M1 aminopeptidases; alternatively, PPII-S269E replacement might be sufficient to transform PPII into an aminopeptidase. These hypotheses were supported by site-directed mutagenesis; the mutants lost omegapeptidase but displayed alanyl-aminopeptidase activity. In conclusion, recognition of a substrate without an N-terminal charge requires neutralization of the aminopeptidase anionic binding site; furthermore, shortening of side chain at PPII-269 position is required for adjustment to the pyroglutamyl residue. Pyroglutamyl peptidase II (PPII), a highly specific membrane-bound omegapeptidase, removes N-terminal pyroglutamyl from thyrotropin-releasing hormone (<Glu-His-Pro-NH2), inactivating the peptide in the extracellular space. PPII and enzymes with distinct specificities such as neutral aminopeptidase (APN), belong to the M1 metallopeptidase family. M1 aminopeptidases recognize the N-terminal amino group of substrates or inhibitors through hydrogen-bonding to two conserved residues (Gln-213 and exopeptidase motif Glu-355 in human APN), whereas interactions involved in recognition of pyroglutamyl residue by PPII are unknown. In rat PPII, the conserved exopeptidase residue is Glu-408, whereas the other one is Ser-269. Given that variations in M1 peptidase specificity are likely due to changes in the catalytic region, we constructed three-dimensional models for the catalytic domains of PPII and APN. The models showed a salt bridge interaction between PPII-Glu-408 and PPII-Lys-463, whereas the equivalent APN-Glu-355 did not participate in a salt bridge. Docking of thyrotropin-releasing hormone in PPII model suggested that the pyroglutamyl residue interacted with PPII-Ser-269. According to our models, PPII-S269Q and -K463N mutations should leave Glu-408 in a physicochemical context similar to that found in M1 aminopeptidases; alternatively, PPII-S269E replacement might be sufficient to transform PPII into an aminopeptidase. These hypotheses were supported by site-directed mutagenesis; the mutants lost omegapeptidase but displayed alanyl-aminopeptidase activity. In conclusion, recognition of a substrate without an N-terminal charge requires neutralization of the aminopeptidase anionic binding site; furthermore, shortening of side chain at PPII-269 position is required for adjustment to the pyroglutamyl residue. Amino- or omegapeptidases hydrolyze the peptide bond linking the N-terminal amino acids of peptides, selecting either a free terminal amino group or a <Glu 2The abbreviations used are: <Glu, pyroglutamic acid; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; PPII, pyroglutamyl peptidase II; rPPII, rat PPII; AP, aminopeptidase; APN, aminopeptidase N; APA, aminopeptidase A; LTA4H, leukotriene A4 hydrolase; L-RAP, leukocyte-derived arginine aminopeptidase; F3, tricorn interacting factor 3; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; βNA, β-naphthylamide; SCR, structurally conserved regions; PA, pepstatin A. 2The abbreviations used are: <Glu, pyroglutamic acid; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing hormone; PPII, pyroglutamyl peptidase II; rPPII, rat PPII; AP, aminopeptidase; APN, aminopeptidase N; APA, aminopeptidase A; LTA4H, leukotriene A4 hydrolase; L-RAP, leukocyte-derived arginine aminopeptidase; F3, tricorn interacting factor 3; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; βNA, β-naphthylamide; SCR, structurally conserved regions; PA, pepstatin A. residue at the P1 substrate position. They have been grouped in families according to their catalytic mechanisms and amino acid sequences. The M1 family clusters zinc metallopeptidases widely distributed in nature, with homologues found in bacteria, fungi, plants, invertebrates, amphibians, birds, and mammals (1Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 1998; (pp. , Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA): 994-1032Google Scholar, 2Rawlings N.D. Morton F.R. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 270-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). They are broadly expressed in animal tissues, where they play critical roles in maturation, activation, and degradation of peptides and, therefore, in a variety of physiological processes. Their abnormal expression has been linked to cancer and other pathological conditions such as cardiovascular disorders (3Nanus D.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 6307-6309PubMed Google Scholar, 4Sato Y. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2004; 27: 772-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Albiston A.L. Ye S. Chai S.Y. Protein Pept. Lett. 2004; 11: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The M1 family contains aminopeptidases (AP) with varied specificities, defined in part by their preference for the type of N-terminal residue; among them are the neutral AP (APN; EC 3.4.11.2), the acidic AP (APA; EC 3.4.11.7) and the basic AP (EC 3.4.11.6), or the leukocyte-derived arginine AP (L-RAP; EC 3.4.). Each of these aminopeptidases has multiple tissue specific roles in vivo. For example, in brain APN controls vasopressin release through the hydrolysis of angiotensin III (6Zini S. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Chauvel E. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11968-11973Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar); peptidases belonging to the oxytocinase subfamily play important roles in maintenance of normal pregnancy, memory retention, blood pressure regulation, and antigen presentation (7Tsujimoto M. Hattori A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). All members of the M1 family are aminopeptidases, except for pyroglutamyl peptidase II (PPII, EC 3.4.19.6), a membrane-bound omegapeptidase that catalyzes the inactivation of the neuropeptide thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, <Glu-His-Pro-NH2) in the extracellular space (8Charli J.L.

TRH is a neurohormone that regulates adenohypophysial secretions and a neurotransmitter with effects on multiple central nervous system functions, including cognition and locomotion (13O'Leary R.M. O'Connor B. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Morley J.E. Life Sci. 1979; 25: 1539-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 15Horita A.

Clinical studies have reported beneficial effects of its administration in several diseases, but these improvements are of short duration. The rapid inactivation of TRH by PPII in the central nervous system extracellular space (17Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 599-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 18Kelly J.A. Essays Biochem. 1995; 30: 133-149PubMed Google Scholar) represents a significant drawback in its potential use as a therapeutic agent. Rat and human PPII cDNAs encode sequences with a high degree of conservation (19Schauder B. Schomburg L. Köhrle J. Bauer K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9534-9538Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Schomburg L. Turwitt S. Presche G. Lohmann D. Horsthemke B. Bauer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Purification of the brain enzyme indicates that it is a glycoprotein composed of two identical subunits with a molecular mass of 230 kDa when solubilized with trypsin (21Wilk S. Wilk E. Neurochem. Int. 1989; 15: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Bauer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The primary structure of M1 membrane-anchored metallopeptidases includes a small intracellular N-terminal fragment, one transmembrane segment, and a large extracellular C-terminal region that holds the exopeptidase ((G/A)(A/G)MEN) and catalytic (HEXXHX18E) motifs. Soluble members share sequence homology with the ectodomains of M1 membrane peptidases; this similarity increases remarkably in the region surrounding the conserved motifs (20Schomburg L. Turwitt S. Presche G. Lohmann D. Horsthemke B. Bauer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For PPII as for other glucinzins, it was proposed that the His residues and the C-terminal Glu within the catalytic motif (441HEXXHX18E464) coordinate the Zn2+ atom, whereas PPII-Glu-442 activates a water molecule, and PPII-Tyr-528 stabilizes the transition state (23Papadopoulos T. Kelly J.A. Bauer K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9347-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments among M1 peptidases show that rat PPII shares 34% amino acid identity with human APN, 32% with mouse APA, 31% with human L-RAP, or 26% with human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H; EC 3.3.2.6) (Fig. 1). In contrast to APN, the most similar counterpart in the family, PPII, is a narrow-specificity enzyme hydrolyzing pyroglutamyl from TRH or very closely related tripeptides or tetrapeptides but not from longer peptides such as luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, bombesin, or neurotensin (24O'Connor B. O'Cuinn G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 150: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Elmore M.A. Griffiths E.C. O'Connor B. O'Cuinn G.

PPII substrates have the general structure <Glu-XY, where X is a moderately bulky and uncharged residue, and Y is Pro, Ala, Trp, Pro-Gly, Pro-NH2 (TRH), Pro-β-naphthylamine (βNA), or Pro-7-amino-4-methyl coumarin (20Schomburg L. Turwitt S. Presche G. Lohmann D. Horsthemke B. Bauer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Elmore M.A. Griffiths E.C. O'Connor B. O'Cuinn G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16746-16751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of M1 peptidases in the metabolism of peptides, the structural determinants ensuring their strict exopeptidase action and specificity are poorly explored. LTA4H, a soluble bifunctional enzyme (epoxide hydrolase and aminopeptidase) was the first M1 metallopeptidase with a crystallographic structure solved (31Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggstrom J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of the tricorn-interacting factor F3 (F3) was also reported (32Kyrieleis O.J.P. Goettig P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The LTA4H and F3 structures consist of three and four domains. Domains I, II, and IV of F3 are equivalent to the three domains of the LTA4H structure, whereas the barrel-like β-sheet structure of domain III is a unique feature of F3. Superposition of the single domains of LTA4H and F3 demonstrates a variable degree of similarity; the N-terminal domain forming a saddle-like structure that covers the active site, and the thermolysin-like catalytic domain, including the zinc-binding residues, are very similar in these proteins. In contrast, the C-terminal domains are partially conserved and differ considerably in their relative positions (32Kyrieleis O.J.P. Goettig P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 787-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The remarkable structural similarity between the LTA4H and F3 catalytic domains, the high sequence conservation around the M1 catalytic domains, and site-directed mutagenesis studies (20Schomburg L. Turwitt S. Presche G. Lohmann D. Horsthemke B. Bauer K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Rudberg P. Tholander F. Thunnissen M. Haeggström J.Z. J.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14785-14793Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) suggest that they use a common catalytic mechanism and that different N-terminal residue preferences (neutral (APN), acidic (APA), arginyl (L-RAP), or PPII) are supported by discrete changes near the active site. In the M1 aminopeptidases, specific recognition of the free N-terminal group of substrates and inhibitors involves hydrogen bonding with two conserved residues. The structure of LTA4H in complex with the competitive inhibitor bestatin shows that Glu-271, located within the exopeptidase motif, and Gln-136 are positioned in the active site; both make hydrogen bonds to the free amine of the inhibitor, which chemically resembles a peptide substrate, suggesting their participation in the binding of the N-terminal group of substrates. Experimental analysis as well as examination of the x-ray structure of LTA4H-E271Q inactive mutant, indicates that Glu-271 carboxylate is not only involved in the N-terminal recognition but also has a critical role in the aminopeptidase activity (33Rudberg P. Tholander F. Thunnissen M. Haeggström J.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1398-1404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is proposed that the counterparts of LTA4H-Glu-271, APA-Glu-352, and APN-Glu-355 interact with the free amino group of substrates and inhibitors via a hydrogen bond, with their negative charge stabilizing the transition state (34Luciani N. Marie-Claire C. Ruffet E. Beaumont A. Roques B.P. Fournié-Zaluski M.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Vazeux G. Iturrioz X. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortés C. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Additionally, APA-Glu-215, counterpart of LTA4H-Gln-136, is involved in the exopeptidase specificity by interacting with the N-terminal amine of the substrate, contributing together with the exopeptidase motif Glu-352 to the correct positioning of substrates and inhibitors in the active site (36Rozenfeld R. Iturrioz X. Okada M. Maigret B. Llorens-Cortes C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14785-14793Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In conclusion, recognition of the α-amino group of substrates, or inhibitors, by M1 aminopeptidases implicates hydrogen bond and charge interaction with a glutamate residue within the exopeptidase motif (anionic binding site) as well as another hydrogen bond with the Glu or Gln residue equivalent to APA-Glu-215 or LTA4H-Gln-136. Unlike aminopeptidase substrates, TRH does not have an α-amino group at its N terminus, implying that in PPII substrate recognition differs from the rest of the M1 family members. In PPII, exopeptidase motif Glu (PPII-Glu-408) is conserved, and its replacement by Gln leads to a completely inactive enzyme, whereas the E408D mutant has a very low catalytic activity (due to a decreased Vmax value, whereas Km is not affected) (23Papadopoulos T. Kelly J.A. Bauer K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9347-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This suggests that position and negative charge of PPII-Glu-408 carboxylate are critical for catalysis but not for substrate binding. In the absence of structural information to understand the omegapeptidase specificity of PPII and to compare it with that of M1 aminopeptidases, we performed multiple alignments of M1 family members and constructed by homology modeling three-dimensional models for part of rat PPII, human APN, and L-RAP ectodomains; TRH was docked in the PPII model. We predicted that substituting one or two PPII-specific residues for M1 family residues was sufficient to migrate from PPII to alanyl-aminopeptidase specificity. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments supported these theoretical predictions. Materials—Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DNA purifications were done using Qiagen (Valencia, CA) kits: QIAquick PCR purification kit, QIAquick gel extraction kit, and plasmid Mini and Midi kits. TaqDNA polymerase, pcDNA3.1/HisA expression vector, and liposome transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 were from Invitrogen. pEGFP-N3 expression vector and anti-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) antibody (BD Living Colors) were from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Monoclonal anti-poly-His/alkaline phosphatase conjugate (clone HIS-1), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, iodoacetamide, pepstatin A (PA), and deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) were obtained from Sigma. pBluescript II KS and SK were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Synthetic substrates Ala-βNA, (Glu-βNA, <Glu-βNA, and TRH-βNA were from Bachem (Bunderdorf, Switzerland). Actinonin was from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate were from Roche. Immobilon-P membranes were from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). For DNA sequencing, we used a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Multiple alignments were performed with ClustalW. Modeling of Catalytic Domains of PPII, PPII Mutants, APN, and L-RAP (Lys-392)—By homology modeling, three-dimensional models were constructed for the catalytic domains of rat PPII and human APN (residues 244–623 and 190–567) using as template the x-ray crystallographic structure of human LTA4H (31Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggstrom J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). PPII and APN models contained only the region most conserved between template and PPII or APN because we were interested in studying the structure-function relationship for the active sites. The method was similar to that used for APA modeling (37Rozenfeld R. Iturrioz X. Maigret B. Llorens-Cortes C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29242-29252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). InsightII (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego, CA) was used to construct the models. We aligned the sequences of APN or PPII with that of LTA4H taking into account the multiple alignment between several proteins of the M1 family and the secondary structure of the template as well as experimental information from previous site-directed mutagenesis studies. Aligned regions, in which we assumed that the secondary structure was conserved, were defined as structurally conserved regions (SCRs), and unaligned regions were defined as loops. Initial models were obtained by transfer of coordinates from the template to PPII or APN sequences in the SCRs and completed by adding the missing loops using the loop search tool. The loop length, the anchor regions corresponding to the three residues at either end of the loop, and the position of critical residues were taken into account. Steric conflicts were corrected during model building using the rotamer library. In each case we minimized the initial model using the conjugate gradient method, a cutoff of 20 Å, keeping the backbone fixed (except for the loops) and the side chains free to move. A second round of minimization was repeated without any restriction. We used the Accelrys CFF97 force field. We added a Zn2+ atom based on its position in the template structure. The minimized model was placed in a water box (dimensions: 80, 95, 80 Å), and 5 or 15 water molecules were substituted with sodium ions to achieve neutrality for PPII or APN system. To eliminate crashes between sodium ions and solvent, we deleted water molecules surrounding the ions (radius = 2 Å). The completed systems (protein, Zn2+, counter-ions, and water molecules) were transferred to NAMD using CHARMM27 force field. Once in NAMD, the refinement procedure continued with several energy minimization steps followed by molecular dynamics. We began by fixing the backbone of the protein, whereas side chains, water molecules, and ions were variables; in a subsequent step the whole system was relaxed. Periodic boundary conditions were used with the same cutoff to truncate non-bonded interactions. The dielectric constant was 1. We checked the stability of the models during molecular dynamics (500 ps); backbone atoms did not have residual mean square deviations greater than 1.5 Å. PPII mutants were modeled by substituting the desired side chain in PPII model followed by energy minimization and 300 ps of molecular dynamics. Because of the sequence similarity between L-RAP and LTA4H sequences, the crystal structure of human LTA4H was also chosen as a template for construction of a three-dimensional model of human L-RAP (Lys-392) (residues 118–494); three-dimensional modeling was performed by using CPH model 2.0 homology modeling server (38Lund O. Nielsen M. Lundegaard C. Worning P. Abstract at the CASP5 conference. 2002; : A102Google Scholar). Docking of TRH in PPII Model—To understand the structural basis of TRH recognition by PPII, we performed docking studies. Using InsightII, TRH was manually docked in the PPII catalytic domain model according to bestatin position in the template structure (31Thunnissen M.M. Nordlund P. Haeggstrom J.Z. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). All water molecules surrounding the peptide in a radius of 2 Å were deleted, and the PPII-TRH system was subjected to minimization steps followed by molecular dynamics (500 ps). Expression Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Expression vectors for rat PPII (pN3/rPPII), poly-His-tagged rPPII (pcDNA3.1/HisA-rPPII), and EGFP fused in-frame to the C terminus of rPPII (pEGFPN3/rPPII) were constructed as previously described (39Chávez-Gutiérrez L. Bourdais J. Aranda G. Vargas M.A. Matta-Camacho E. Ducancel F. Segovia L. Joseph-Bravo P. Charli J.L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In pcDNA3.1/HisA-rPPII, the rPPII coding sequence was in-frame C-terminal to the poly-His tag. pEGFP-N3 expression vector for EGFP was used as the control vector in transfections. Site-directed mutagenesis was done according to the one-step overlap extension PCR method (40Urban A. Neukirchen S. Jaeger K.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2227-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The PCR amplifications were performed with 35 cycles of denaturation (92 °C, 30 s), annealing (55 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 min). Fragment XmaI/SacI of rat PPII cDNA was cloned into both pBlueScript II/KS and SK. These vectors served as PCR templates in the presence of one universal primer (T7, 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) and 2 mutagenic primers, each containing the mutagenic substitution into a 20-nucleotide overlapping region. S269E, 5′-ACTCAGTTTGAACCTACGCATGCCAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-ATGCGTAGGTTCAAACTGAGTAACACCGAG-3′; S259A, 5′-ACTCAGTTTGCACCTACGCATGCCAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-ATGCGTAGGTGCAAACTGAGTAACACCGAG-3′; S269Q, 5′-ACTCAGTTTCAACCTACGCATGCCAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-ATGCGTAGGTTGAAACTGAGTAACACCGAG-3′; K463N, 5′-GTGTGGTTGAACGAAGGCTTTGCTCACTAC-3′ and 5′-AAAGCCTTCGTTCAACCACACATCTTCCCA-3′; K463R, 5′-GTGTGGTTGAGGGAAGGCTTTGCTCACTAC-3′ and 5′-AAAGCCTTCCCTCAACCACACATCTTCCCA-3′; K463Q, 5′-GTGTGGTTGCAGGAAGGCTTTGCTCACTAC-3′ and 5′-AAAGCCTTCCTGCAACCACACATCTTCCCA-3′. PCR products were digested (XmaI/SacI), separated by gel electrophoresis, and purified using the gel extraction kit. Each mutant sequence was subcloned back into the wild type, poly-His, or EGFP-tagged PPII expression vector. Double mutants were constructed sequentially using the same protocol. The presence of the mutation and the absence of nonspecific mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection, Membrane Preparation, and Fluorescence Microscopy—COS-7 or C6 glioma cells were cultured and transfected as previously described (39Chávez-Gutiérrez L. Bourdais J. Aranda G. Vargas M.A. Matta-Camacho E. Ducancel F. Segovia L. Joseph-Bravo P. Charli J.L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Cells were collected 48 h post-transfection, and total membranes were prepared essentially as described (41Bourdais J. Romero F. Urostegui B. Cisneros M. Joseph-Bravo P. Charli J.L. Neuropeptides. 2000; 34: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 (buffer A), 0.3 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm iodoacetamide, 1 μm PA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml DNase I by freezing and thawing on ice (3×). Total membranes were collected by centrifugation (90,000 × g, 45 min), the pellet was washed once with buffer A, 1 m NaCl, and centrifugation was repeated. Finally, the pellet was homogenized in buffer A and stored at –80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (42Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). For microscopic analysis, cells were observed under an eclipse TE300 microscope (Nikon, Melville NY) equipped with the cool snap software at 40× magnification. EGFP fluorescence was detected using the EPI-FL filter block (Nikon). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Membrane preparations were submitted to reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred, and poly-His or EGFP-tagged PPII (wild type or mutants) was detected as described (39Chávez-Gutiérrez L. Bourdais J. Aranda G. Vargas M.A. Matta-Camacho E. Ducancel F. Segovia L. Joseph-Bravo P. Charli J.L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The protein expression levels were estimated by densitometric scanning with a Fluor-S Multi-Imager (Bio-Rad). Peptidase Activity Determination—PPII activity was determined using 400 μm TRH-βNA as substrate in a coupled assay with excess dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5) essentially as described (41Bourdais J. Romero F. Urostegui B. Cisneros M. Joseph-Bravo P. Charli J.L. Neuropeptides. 2000; 34: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); assay buffer (50 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.5) included 0.2 mm N-ethyl maleimide, an inhibitor of pyroglutamyl peptidase I (EC 3.4.19.3), and 0.2 mm bacitracin, an inhibitor of prolyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26); both are soluble enzymes able to degrade TRH in vitro. Alanyl- or glutamylaminopeptidases activities were assayed with 400 μm Ala-βNA or 400 μm Glu-βNA in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. To determine pyroglutamyl peptidase activity, assay buffer (50 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.5) included 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide; the enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of 400 μm <Glu-βNA. All enzymatic assays were performed at 37 °C under initial velocity conditions in duplicate or triplicate, and their mean was taken as one determination for each independent transfection. Released βNA was determined in a fluorometer (excitation, 335 nm; emission, 410 nm). Activities of wild type PPII and mutants were normalized by total protein or PPII expression levels for non-tagged or poly-His-tagged proteins. Multiple alignments for the M1 family were performed to study the conservation of the residues involved in the recognition of the α-amino group of substrates and inhibitors by M1 aminopeptidases.

By using a virtual approach based on a modified scoring function, we have selected 200 potential candidates on the basis of their predicted ability of docking into the ligand-binding site of the target. Subsequent experimental verification of the compounds in in vitro and cell-based assays led to the identification of a number of novel high affinity ligands for RXRα. The compounds are capable of displacing 9-cis-retinoic acid with IC50 values in the 10 nm and 5 μm range and exhibit marked antagonistic activity in cellular assays. The inhibitory scaffolds discovered with this method form the basis for the development of novel RXRα ligands with potential therapeutic properties.

A unique property of RXRα is its exceptional capacity to form heterodimers with other nuclear receptors, including retinoic acid receptors (RARs), thyroid hormone receptor, vitamin D receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (1Zhang X.K. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 2Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T.

Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 2Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M.

Heterodimerization of RXRα with its partners can mediate diverse endocrine signaling pathways that when altered can lead to the development of cancer (6Zhang X.K. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2002; 9: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Genetic disruption of RXRα targeted to the prostatic epithelium results in intraepithelial neoplasia in mice (7Huang J. Powell W.C.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4812-4819PubMed Google Scholar), whereas diminished RXRα protein expression may represent an early event in the development of human cancer (8Mao G.E. Reuter V.E. Cordon-Cardo C. Dalbagni G. Scher H.I. DeKernion J.B. Zhang Z.F. Rao J. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 2004; 13: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar). Like other nuclear receptors, RXRα acts as a transcriptional factor to positively or negatively regulate expression of target genes (1Zhang X.K. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 2Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M.

Metab. 1993; 4: 156-162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On binding ligands, RXRα undergoes conformational changes to recruit transcriptional corepressors or coactivators, leading to suppression or activation of transcriptional program on target gene promoters (3Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Cell. 1995; 83: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar, 4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Recent progress indicates that RXRα also exerts certain nongenotropic actions, including its mitochondrial targeting to induce apoptosis (9Lee K.W. Ma L. Yan X. Liu B. Zhang X.K. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16942-16948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 10Cao X. Liu W. Lin F. Li H. Kolluri S.K. Lin B. Han Y.-H. Dawson M.I. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell.

RXRα was found to cotranslocate with NGFI-B (also known as Nur77 or TR3) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to nerve growth factor treatment (13Katagiri Y. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Ozato K. Guroff G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), a process implicated in the differentiation of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. In response to apoptotic stimuli, RXRα and Nur77 associate with mitochondria as a Nur77/RXRα heterodimer in LNCaP prostate cancer and H460 lung cancer cells (10Cao X. Liu W. Lin F. Li H. Kolluri S.K. Lin B. Han Y.-H. Dawson M.I. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9705-9725Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). RXRα also cotranslocates with Nur77 from the nucleus to mitochondria in response to IGFBP-3 (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3) (9Lee K.W. Ma L. Yan X. Liu B. Zhang X.K. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16942-16948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), presumably its interaction with IGFBP-3. A number of natural and synthetic molecules with different structural features and diverse biological effects have been identified as ligands for RXRα.9-cis-Retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) was the first compound known to bind RXRα. Recently, several dietary fatty acids were found to bind RXRα and appear to act as natural RXRα ligands (14De Urquiza A.M. Liu S. Sjoberg M. Zetterstrom R.H. Griffiths W. Sjovall J. Perlmann T. Science. 2000; 290: 2140-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 15Goldstein J.T. Dobrzyn A. Clagett-Dame M. Pike J.W. DeLuca H.F. Arch. Biochem.

Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1541-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, (R)-etodolac, also binds RXRα and acts as an RXRα antagonist to inhibit its transactivation, an event which is associated with its tumor-selective induction of apoptosis in animal (11Kolluri S.K. Corr M. James S.Y. Bernasconi M. Lu D. Liu W. Cottam H.B. Leoni L.H. Carson D.A. Zhang X.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2525-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ability of RXRα to bind various ligands that have diverse biological effects suggests that RXRα acts as an important intracellular mediator regulating multiple signal transduction pathways. Such a complexity of RXRα signalings calls for the need to identify additional compounds that selectively regulate a specific RXRα signal transduction pathway. Such molecules could be useful for their therapeutic properties but also will facilitate mechanistic studies on the role of RXRα in signal transduction. In this study, we undertook a structure-based approach for the identification of new RXRα ligands. By using a virtual docking approach based on the three-dimensional structure of RXRα, we identified a number of potential RXRα ligands. Following experimental in vitro and in cell-based assays with top scoring compounds, we have finally identified ligands with nanomicromolar binding affinity to RXRα ligand binding domain (LBD) and selectivity when tested against RARα. Virtual Docking—A target binding site was derived from the crystal structure of the ternary complex involving BMS-649 compound in complex with (h)RXRα-LBD (Protein Data Bank code 1MVC) (17Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Moras D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The protein active site was defined, including those residues within 6.5 Å from the benzoic acid substructure of BMS-649 found in the complex. Hydrogen atoms were calculated using FlexX (BioSolveIT, Sankt Augustin, Germany) (18Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2400) Google Scholar, 19Alvarez J. Stoichet B. Virtual Screening in Drug Discovery. 2005; (CRC Press Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL): 25-46Google Scholar), and water molecules were eliminated. Docking geometries were obtained by using FlexX (five solutions per molecule) implemented on a 20 × 3.2-GHz CPUs Linux cluster. Different parameters of the scoring functions were varied (Table 1), and a collection of random 1026 compounds that included the BMS-649 compound was used to estimate the ranking ability of each function. 50,000 compounds (ChemBridge, San Diego, CA) were subsequently docked and ranked according to the software FlexX using DJ score. Top 200 ranking compounds were selected (Chembridge, San Diego) and experimentally tested in the in vitro displacement assay. Hit compounds were repurchased and tested in additional NMR binding and cell-based assays. When the six validated hits were included in the collection of 1025 compounds, however, the average ranking of the compounds was only slightly better when using DJ score compared with FlexX, although both functions performed much better than Screenscore and Chemscore, with this particular set.TABLE 1Comparison of parameters used with FlexX, Screening, Chemscore, and DJ score functions and the results using the BMS-649 as a test compoundParametersFlexXScreeningChemscoreDJ scoreMatchaMatch indicates matched interaction term.1.001.001.003.00Lipo_contactsbLipo_contacts indicate lipophilic atom-atom contacts.-0.17-0.07-0.12-0.12Ambig_contactscambig_contacts indicate hydrophilic-hydrophobic atom contacts.-0.17-0.070.000.00Weights of plpdWeights of plp indicate weights of plp terms.10.311plp_hbondeplp_hbond indicates hbond components of PLP scoring.2.002.002.0020.00plp_stericfplp_steric indicates steric components of PLP scoring.0.40.40.40.4plp_repgplp_rep indicates repulsive components of PLP scoring.20202020EntropyhEntropy indicates the term used.BoehmBoehmChemscoreChemscorer.m.s.d.ir.m.s.d. indicates the root mean square deviation between all heavy atoms of the crystal structure and docked structures generated by the different scoring functions.1.11 Å1.00 Å0.97 Å1.08 ÅRankingjRanking of the crystal structure of the BMS-649 compound when included in a data base of randomly selected 1025 compounds.

Open table in a new tab Ligand Binding Assays—His-tagged (h)RXRα-LBD (amino acids 223–462) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as a polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein for use in competition binding assays (20Cavasotto C.N. Liu G. James S.Y. Hobbs P.D. Peterson V.J. Bhattacharya A.A. Kolluri S.K. Zhang X.K. Leid M. Abagyan R. Liddington R.C. Dawson M.I. J. Med.

Briefly, (h)RXRα-LBD (100 ng) was incubated in binding buffer (0.15 m KCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% CHAPS detergent (Roche Diagnostics) and 8% glycerol; 300 liters) with 7.5 nm 9-cis-[3H]RA (44 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of nonlabeled compound for 16–18 h at 4 °C. Next, His-Bind resin (500 μg; Novagen) was added, and incubation with shaking was continued for 1 h at room temperature. The His-Bind resin was washed (three times with 1 ml of binding buffer) to separate receptor-bound from nonbound label, suspended (500 ml of buffer), and then transferred for scintillation counting (3.5 ml of EcoLume liquid scintillation fluid, ICN; Beckman Coulter LS 3801 counter). Experiments were performed in duplicate, and specific binding was calculated as the average of the percentage of the total bound counts/min remaining defined as counts/min/(total bound counts/min) × 100. NMR Experiments—All experiments were carried out at 298 K by using a 600- or a 500-MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer, equipped with four and three rf channels and pulse-field gradients along the z axis, respectively. NMR samples were consisted of 100 μm of compound in presence or absence of 10 μm of protein, in 40 mm D2O phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. A spin-lock pulse of variable length (1, 10, 100, and 200 ms) was used for the acquisition of one-dimensional 1HT1ρ series (22Hajduk P.J. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12257-12261Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 23Pellecchia M. Sem D.S. Wuthrich K. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 3: 211-219Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Each spectrum was acquired with 256 scans. Water suppression was achieved by means of a WATERGATE pulse scheme. Spectra were processed and analyzed with the software Mestrec-C. RXRa Transactivation Assays—CV-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. For transfection assays, cells were seeded at 1.0 × 105 cells/ml in 24-well plates for 16–24 h before transfection. Cells were then transfected using FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) with (TREpal)2-tk-CAT with either RXRa or RARα (25 ng). In addition, cells were also transfected with β-galactosidase expression vector (pCH 110, Amersham Biosciences) and carrier DNA (pBluescript, Stratagene) to a final concentration of 1000 mg/well. At 20 h after transfection, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum, and cells were treated for 24 h with either 10 nm 9-cis-RA for RXRa or 10 nm all-trans-RA for RARa or with varying concentrations of a compound of interest. CAT activity was expressed relative to β-galactosidase activity to normalize for transfection efficiency (1Zhang X.K. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 2Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in triplicate and the results averaged. Western Blotting—Cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl, with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate; Sigma). Equivalent protein extracts from each sample were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Protein was quantitated by a total protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad). Nitrocellulose membranes were preblocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 detergent for 1 h at room temperature. Following phosphate-buffered saline/Tween washes, preblocked membranes were incubated with 1 μg/ml equivalent of anti-RARβ polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). RARβ protein was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody against immunoglobulins (Amersham Biosciences) after 1 h of incubation at room temperature, and specific bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Equivalent loading of samples was determined by reprobing each nitrocellulose membrane with a mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing β-actin (Sigma) (24Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X.

In order to identify novel RXRα ligands, we adopted a structure-based approach based on virtual docking of a large library of drug-like small organic molecules followed by experimental verification of top scoring compounds. This approach is based on first obtaining reliable docking geometries for each compound and subsequently being able to rank order the compounds for their predicted binding affinity according to a scoring function. Although most of the available virtual docking software packages have demonstrated their utility in several different cases (25Cummings M.D. DesJarlais R.L. Gibbs A.C. Mohan V. Jaeger E.P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 962-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 26Shoichet B.K. McGovern S.L. Wei B. Irwin J.J. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Reviews in Computational Chemistry. 2001; 17 (Wiley-VCH, New York): 1-60Google Scholar), in practical terms, it has been shown that their success and failures are target-dependent (25Cummings M.D. DesJarlais R.L. Gibbs A.C. Mohan V. Jaeger E.P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 962-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In addition, our recent experience with ranking compounds according to a given scoring function is not too encouraging (28Forino M. Jung D. Easton J.B. Houghton P.J. Pellecchia M. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 2278-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although a consensus score between several functions is a possible solution, we found that intermolecular hydrogen bonding and visual inspection of the docked geometries significantly increase the success rate of the ranked compounds (28Forino M. Jung D. Easton J.B. Houghton P.J. Pellecchia M. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 2278-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The formation of hydrogen bonds with Arg-316 is a very important feature that is common to virtually all the reported RXRα ligands as well as its natural substrate, 9-cis-RA (29Dawson M.I. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Cancer Agents. 2004; 4: 199-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we tried to optimize the parameters for the scoring functions in a way that would emphasize the importance of hydrogen bonding interactions.

Auton T.R. Paolini G.V. Mee R.P. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1997; 11: 425-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar) that produced the most reliable ranking (Table 1). As internal control we used the x-ray-derived docked structure of the compound BMS-649 in complex with RXRα (Protein Data Bank code 1MVC) (17Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Moras D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the Screening score (34Gehlhaar D.K. Verkhivker G.M. Rejto P.A. Sherman C.J. Fogel D.B. Fogel L.J. Freer S.T. Chem.

Des. 1997; 11: 425-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar), the authors decreased the factors of lipophilic and “ambiguous interactions” to increase the contribution of “matching interactions.” In addition, Eldridge et al. (33Eldridge M.D. Murray C.W. Auton T.R. Paolini G.V. Mee R.P. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1997; 11: 425-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar) reported on a modified FlexX score (similar to Chemscore) that was obtained by changing the parameterizations of the entropy term and the definition of hydrophobic groups (35Stahl M. Rarey M. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Here we afford another small improvement on this work (Table 1) in order to produce docked geometries and ranking that better reflect the importance of hydrogen bond formation in RXRα. By using the BMS-649 as test ligand, we could verify that all the different scoring functions produced a docked conformation that is remarkably close to that in the crystallographic coordinates (Table 1 and Fig. 1). However, when the compound was inserted in a data base of random 1025 compounds, BMS-649 ranked first only when using our modified scoring function, which we named DJ score (Table 1). These data gave us the confidence that this approach would lead to reliable docked geometries and that high affinity ligands could be found among the top ranking compounds. Therefore, by using this strategy we first obtained the docked geometries of each of the 50,000 compounds from the entire Chembridge DiverseSet collection (Chembridge, San Diego) and subsequently examined experimentally a subset of compounds constituted by the top ranking 200 molecules. To experimentally verify which of the selected top scoring compounds effectively binds RXRα, competitive ligand binding studies using recombinant histidine-tagged human (h)RXRα-LBD were conducted in duplicate, with compounds initially tested at 10 μm concentration. Dose-response curves were subsequently obtained for those compounds that reproducibly displaced more than 50% of 9-cis-[3H]RA at 10 μm concentration. Our results show that 6 of 200 top scoring compounds were able to compete the binding of 9-cis-[3H]RA with relative binding affinities, as measured by IC50 values, ranging from 10 nm to 5 μm (Table 2). A representative binding curve along with the data for the 9-cis-RA control is shown in Fig. 2. In order to exclude possible nonspecific binding of the compounds to the reference ligand, additional binding assays of the compounds to (h)RXRα-LBD were performed by acquiring one-dimensional 1H NMR T1ρ series for each compound (at 100 μm concentration) (22Hajduk P.J. Olejniczak E.T. Fesik S.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12257-12261Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 23Pellecchia M. Sem D.S. Wuthrich K. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 3: 211-219Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar) in the absence and presence of a substoichiometric amount of protein (10 μm). However, because 100 μm concentration is a lower detection limit for these experiments with our current instrumentation, we could perform this NMR binding assay only on compounds that are soluble at this concentration (Table 2). Representative T1ρ experiments (spin lock duration equal to 200 ms) are reported in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the T1ρ spectrum of compound 6 exhibits an obvious decrease in signal intensity when compared with the same spectrum measured in the presence of (h)RXRα-LBD (Fig. 3A), thus indicating that the compound interacts with the target. Compounds 4 and 5 proved to be stronger RXRα ligands according to such an assay as indicated by the significant reduction of the signal intensity that could be observed in the T1ρ spectra (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, for the compounds that could be tested by NMR, there is a close parallel between the in vitro displacement assay and the direct interaction of the ligands with (h)RXRα-LBD (Table 2).TABLE 2Structures of hit compounds and their in vitro characterization Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3NMR-based binding assays.

Hydrogen bonding between each compound and Arg-316 and the backbone amide of Ala-327 are also highlighted. Interestingly, these compounds lack the typical carboxylate group involved in hydrogen bonding and salt-bridge interactions with the residues mentioned above, which is characteristic of most RXRα ligands reported thus far (29Dawson M.I. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Cancer Agents. 2004; 4: 199-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Instead, these interactions seem to involve the barbituric acid ring in compounds 1 and 3–5 and a nitro-group in compounds 2 and 6, making these structures novel RXRα-binding motifs. To further evaluate the effect of these compounds in cells, an RXRα transcriptional activation activity was assessed in classical cotransfection assays. Transcriptional activation in CV-1 cells was determined using cotransfected RXRα expression vector and RXRα-responsive CAT reporter construct ((TREpal)2-tk-CAT) (1Zhang X.K. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 37Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). The TREpal is a palindromic response element that is activated by RXR-agonist complexes (1Zhang X.K. Hoffmann B. Tran P.B. Graupner G. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 355: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 2Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Dose-dependent antagonism of the RXRα homodimer activated by 9-cis-RA was observed with compounds 1–5 (Fig. 5A). The specificity of these compounds for RXRα could be inferred by the fact that they had no effect on the ability of RARα to stimulate expression of the same reporter in response to all-trans-RA (Fig. 5B). These data should further validate the discovered compounds as bona fide RXRα ligands. To further elucidate the antagonist effect of these compounds, we studied whether they could inhibit expression of RARβ, which is regulated by various RXRα-containing complexes (36James S.Y. Lin F. Kolluri S.K. Dawson M.I. Zhang X.K. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3531-3538PubMed Google Scholar, 37Zhang X.K. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M.I. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M.

Treatment of ZR-75-1 cells with all-trans-RA strongly induced the expression of RARβ, which was completely inhibited by each compound with the exception of compound 6, consistent with the inhibitory effects witnessed on TREpal reporter gene activity (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that compounds 1–5 are effective RXRα antagonists. In conclusion, we report here a successful virtual docking approach in which 5 of 200 selected compounds showed RXRα transcriptional antagonistic activity in vitro and in cells with binding affinities in the nanomolar range in vitro and low micromolar cellular activity. These compounds with their structural features differing from the existing RXR ligands may represent valuable tools to assist with the dissection of the complex RXR signal transduction pathways. The novel structural scaffolds reported here could be useful for the development of potential lead compounds targeting members of the nuclear receptor superfamily in the development of novel cancer therapeutics.

The group size is regulated in part by a negative feedback pathway mediated by a secreted multipolypeptide complex called counting factor (CF). The CF signal transduction pathway involves CF-repressing internal glucose levels by increasing the Km of glucose-6-phosphatase. Little is known about how this enzyme is regulated. Glucose-6-phosphatase is associated with microsomes in both Dictyostelium and mammals. We find that the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in crude microsomes from cells with high, normal, or low CF activity had a negative correlation with the amount of CF present in these cell lines. In crude cytosols (supernatants from ultracentrifugation of cell lysates), the glucose-6-phosphatase activity had a positive correlation with CF accumulation. The crude cytosols were further fractionated into a fraction containing molecules greater than 10 kDa (S>10K) and molecules less than 10 KDa (S<10K). S>10K from wild-type cells strongly repressed the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in wild-type microsomes, whereas S>10K from countin– cells (cells with low CF activity) significantly increased the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in wild-type microsomes by decreasing Km. The regulatory activities in the wild-type and countin– S>10Ks are heat-labile and protease-sensitive, suggesting that they are proteins. S<10K from both wild-type and countin– cells did not significantly change glucose-6-phosphatase activity. Together, the data suggest that, as a part of a pathway modulating multicellular group size, CF regulates one or more proteins greater than 10 KDa in crude cytosol that affect microsome-associated glucose-6-phosphatase activity.

Much remains to be understood about how organisms regulate the size of multicellular structures. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum provides an excellent model system to study size regulation, for these cells form evenly sized groups of ∼2 × 104 cells. Dictyostelium cells grow on soil surfaces as individual amoebae and feed on bacteria (for review, see Refs. 1Loomis W.F.

As more and more cells starve, the local conditioned medium factor concentration reaches a threshold level. This allows cells to aggregate using relayed pulses of cyclic AMP as a chemoattractant and form dendritic aggregation streams (for review, see Refs. 2Kessin R.H. Dictyostelium Evolution, Cell Biology, and the Development of Multicellularity. 2001; (Developmental and Cell Biology Series (Bard, J. B. L., Barlow, P. W., and Kirk, D.

Cytoskeleton. 1987; 8: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Each aggregate forms a fruiting body consisting of a spherical spore mass held atop by a rigid stem of stalk cells. The purpose of these structures is to facilitate spore dispersal. If a fruiting body is too small, the spore mass will be too close to the ground for optimal spore dispersal. On the other hand, if a spore mass is too big, it will slide down the stalk, or the fruiting body will fall over. Therefore, the fruiting body size is of great importance. There are several mechanisms Dictyostelium cells use to regulate the size of aggregates and the fruiting bodies, such as causing excessively large aggregation streams to fragment into groups of ∼2 × 104 cells (7Shaffer B.M. Q. J. Microsc. Sci. 1957; 98: 393-405Google Scholar, 8Hohl H.R. Raper K.B. Dev. Biol. 1964; 9: 137-153Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 9Kopachik W.J. J. Embryol. Exp.

We previously identified a 450-kDa protein complex called counting factor (CF) 2The abbreviations used are: CF, counting factor; WT, wild type.2The abbreviations used are: CF, counting factor; WT, wild type. that is involved in group size determination in Dictyostelium (10Brock D.A.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1960-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CF causes aggregate streams to fragment by increasing cell motility and decreasing cell-cell adhesion, thereby repressing group size (12Roisin-Bouffay C. Jang W. Gomer R.H. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Tang L. Gao T. McCollum C. Jang W. Vickers M.G. Ammann R. Gomer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Disruption of the smlA gene causes the oversecretion of CF, resulting in the formation of extensively fragmented aggregate streams and many small fruiting bodies (10Brock D.A. Buczynski F. Spann T.P. Wood S.A. Cardelli J. Gomer R.H. Development. 1996; 122: 2569-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When a component of CF is disrupted, cells secrete essentially undetectable levels of CF activity (11Brock D.A. Gomer R.H. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1960-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Brock D.A. Hatton R.D. Giurgiutiu D.-V. Scott B. Ammann R. Gomer R.H.

In these cells, the aggregation streams seldom break and coalesce into large fruiting bodies which tend to collapse. Starving cells in the presence of recombinant components of CF including countin, CF50, or CF45-1 mimic the effect of CF and cause streams to fragment and form small fruiting bodies (14Brock D.A.

CF regulates cell-cell adhesion and motility by repressing internal levels of glucose, and that glucose is a part of the CF signal transduction pathway (17Jang W. Chiem B. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31972-31979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To understand how CF regulates glucose, we examined the effect of CF on enzymes involved in glucose metabolism (18Jang W. Gomer R.H. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). CF has little effect on amylase or glycogen phosphorylase, enzymes involved in glucose production from glycogen. Glucokinase activity (the first specific step of glycolysis) is repressed by high levels of CF but is not affected by an 8-min exposure to recombinant countin. The second enzyme specific for glycolysis, phosphofructokinase, is not regulated by CF. The gluconeogenic counterpart of phosphofructokinase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, is not regulated by CF or recombinant countin, whereas glucose-6-phosphatase (the gluconeogenic counterpart of glucokinase) is regulated by both CF and an 8-min exposure to recombinant countin. The countin-induced changes in the Km and Vmax of glucose-6-phosphatase causes a decrease in glucose production that can account for the countin-induced decrease in glucose levels (18Jang W. Gomer R.H. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphatase is an important enzyme in the control of glucose homeostasis (19Burchell A. Allan B.B.

Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the last biochemical process of gluconeogenesis and is a key step in glycogenolysis in which it hydrolyzes glucose 6-phosphate to glucose and Pi. It is made of multiple transmembrane components, with the active site in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Some of the components transport glucose 6-phosphate from the crude cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum, and others transport glucose and phosphate out. However, very little is known about whether or how glucose-6-phosphatase is regulated, and the enzyme has never been purified. In humans, defects in glucose-6-phosphatase cause glycogen storage disease (26Cori G.T. Cori C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 199: 661-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many efforts have been made to decrease serum glucose levels by temporarily repressing glucose-6-phosphatase as a possible therapeutic treatment for hyperglycemia and diabetes (for review, see Ref. 27Barthel A. Schmoll D. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To determine how CF regulates the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase to decrease internal glucose levels in Dictyostelium, we measured the activity of the enzyme in several different conditions. Because glucose-6-phosphatase activity is associated with microsomes, the enzyme was semipurified by fractionating cell lysates by ultracentrifugation (28van de Werve G. Lange A. Newgard C. Mechin M.C. Li Y. Berteloot A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1533-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We find that CF appears to regulate at least two different components in crude cytosol to decrease the activity of the glucose-6-phosphatase in crude microsomes. Cell Culture—D. discoideum Ax4 wild-type, smlA– (HDB7YA), and countin– (HDB2B/4) cells were grown in HL5 media (with maltose as the carbohydrate source) and starved in PBM buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, 10 μm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.1) at 5 × 106 cells/ml as previously described (10Brock D.A.

At 6 h of development, cells were collected as previously described (17Jang W. Chiem B. Gomer R.H. J. Biol.

The pellets were lysed by freezing in dry ice/ethanol and thawing on ice. 1.5 ml of PB (3.2 mm Na2HPO4, 7.0 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.5) was added to the pellets obtained from 100 ml of shaking starvation culture, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 2 min. 2 μl of clarified cell lysates were used for protein determination. Preparation of Liver Homogenates—Crude microsomes from rat liver were prepared following Mithieux et al. (29Mithieux G. Bordeto J.C. Minassian C. Ajzannay A. Mercier I. Riou J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The liver was rinsed with ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl and homogenized in a 6× volume of PB using a tissue homogenizer (Tekmar, Cincinnati, OH). Clarified liver homogenate was obtained by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C twice. 2 μl of clarified liver homogenates were used for protein determination. Glucose-6-phosphatase Assays—Because glucose-6-phosphatase activity is associated with microsomes, we fractionated clarified Dictyostelium lysates and liver homogenates by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C (28van de Werve G. Lange A. Newgard C. Mechin M.C. Li Y. Berteloot A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1533-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The resulting supernatant (crude cytosol) was removed. 2 ml of PB was gently added to the wall of the ultracentrifugation tube, the tube was swirled gently, and the PB was removed without disturbing the pellet. Where indicated, crude cytosol was further fractionated using 10-kDa cutoff Amicon spin filters (Millipore, Hercules, CA) at 2000 × g for 30 min. This generated a fraction that contained molecules retained by the 10-kDa cutoff spin filter (S>10K) and a second fraction that contained molecules that passed through the 10-kDa cutoff spin filter (S<10K). Before use, the S>10K fraction was brought up to the original volume of the crude cytosol by adding PB. For some experiments, reconstituted crude cytosol was prepared by resuspending the S>10K fraction in the associated S<10K fraction rather than in PB. Where indicated, the pellet from the ultracentrifugation (crude microsomes) was resuspended in PB, crude cytosol, fractionated crude cytosol, or reconstituted crude cytosol. To compare the enzyme activities in the crude microsomes resuspended in different fractions, we measured the glucose-6-phosphatase activity (at different glucose 6-phosphate concentrations) of the crude microsomes resuspended in PB, S>10K, or S<10K and then subtracted the glucose-6-phosphatase activity (at the same glucose 6-phosphate concentrations) of the resuspension media. In some cases the microsomal preparation was resuspended in PB with 0.1% Triton X-100 to measure the activity of the catalytic subunit of the glucose-6-phosphatase complex. For all the assays, 100 μl of sample was used for a glucose-6-phosphatase assay, and 2 μl of sample was used for a Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was measured as previously described (18Jang W. Gomer R.H. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The Vmax and Km of glucose-6-phosphatase were measured by varying the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate in the assay. For unknown reasons we were unable to reproducibly measure glucose-6-phosphatase activity at glucose 6-phosphate concentrations below 0.1 mm. Nonlinear regressions to fit the activity to the Michaelis-Menten equation used the Prism software package (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Supernatant Treatments—To determine the nature of the glucose-6-phosphatase-inhibiting activity of wild-type S>10K and the stimulating activity of countin– S>10K, we subjected wild-type or countin– S>10K to various treatments. After fractionating crude cytosol, S>10K was brought up to half of the original volume of the crude cytosol by adding PB, and the S>10K was separated into aliquots in Eppendorf tubes. Tubes were incubated at 37 and 55 °C for 30 min and 100 °C for 5 min. After incubation at 55 and 100 °C, the S>10K was clarified by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 2 min. In addition, the S>10K was treated with DNase I (Sigma) at 0.5 μg/μl, RNase A (Sigma) at 15 ng/μl, or proteinase K agarose beads (Sigma) at 0.1 mg/μl for 30 min at 37 °C. The proteinase K-agarose beads were removed by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 5 min, twice. Wild-type crude microsomes were resuspended in half of the original volume by adding PB. Resuspended wild-type crude microsomes were mixed with an equal volume of treated countin– S>10K, and glucose-6-phosphatase activities were measured as described above. Cell Lines with Different Extracellular CF Levels Have Different Glucose-6-phosphatase Activities in Crude Microsomes and Crude Cytosols—We previously found that CF decreases internal glucose levels by decreasing the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in crude cell lysates (17Jang W.

Cell. 2005; 4: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Glucose-6-phosphatase is a multicomponent enzyme associated with microsomes in yeast, Dictyostelium, rats, mice, and humans (30Hers H.G. Berthet J. Berthet L. De Duve C. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1951; 33: 21-41PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bjorntorp P. Bjorkerud S. Schersten T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 111: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 32Gilkes N.R. Weeks G.

To determine how CF regulates glucose-6-phosphatase, we measured the activity of the enzyme in crude microsomes (Fig. 1A, Table 1). We have previously observed that high concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate can sometimes cause the lysates of Dictyostelium cells, especially countin– cells, to become highly turbid. 3T. Gao and R. H. Gomer, unpublished result. We were, thus, unable to reproducibly measure the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase at high substrate concentrations in countin– crude microsomes. We normalized the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase in crude microsomes by the amount of protein present in both crude microsomes (Fig. 1) and cleared lysates (Table 1). In both cases, compared with the activity in wild-type crude microsomes, glucose-6-phosphatase activity in crude microsomes from smlA– cells had a low Vmax and a slightly low Km, whereas the glucose-6-phosphastase activity in crude microsomes from countin– cells had a high Vmax and a low Km. At the physiological level of glucose 6-phosphate observed in wild-type cells (∼114 μm), smlA– crude microsomes had a slightly lower glucose-6-phosphatase activity, and countin– crude microsomes had a higher glucose-6-phosphatase activity compared with wild-type crude microsomes (Table 2).TABLE 1The Vmax and Km of glucose-6-phosphatase activity in crude microsomes and crude cytosolParameter measuredsmlA-Wild typecountin-Vmax (crude microsomes) (nmol/mg protein/min)0.190.380.51Km (crude microsomes) (mm)0.400.65<0.1Vmax (crude cytosol) (nmol/mg protein/min)1.50.210.069Km (crude cytosol) (mm)1.20.18<0.1Vmax (cleared lysate) (nmol/mg protein/min)2.11.50.45Km (cleared lysate) (mm)2.42.1<0.1 Open table in a new tab TABLE 2The glucose-6-phosphatase activities at the physiological glucose-6-phosphate levelActivitysmlA-Wild-typecountin-nmol/mg protein/minCrude microsomes0.030.05>0.26Crude cytosol0.120.06>0.035Cleared lysate0.100.08>0.23 Open table in a new tab The fractionation procedure we used separated the cleared lysate into crude microsomes and crude cytosol fractions. To determine how much glucose-6-phosphatase activity is in the crude cytosol, we measured the rate of glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis in the crude cytosol (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Compared with the activity in wild-type crude cytosol, the glucose-6-phosphatase activity in the crude cytosol of smlA– cells had a higher Vmax and Km, whereas the glucose-6-phosphatase activity in the crude cytosol of countin– had a lower Vmax and Km. At the physiological level of glucose 6-phosphate in wild-type cells, the glucose-6-phopshatase activity in smlA– crude cytosol was higher than that of wild-type and countin– crude cytosols (Table 2). Comparing the activities at this glucose 6-phosphate concentration in crude microsomes and crude cytosol, smlA– cells had a high percentage of activity in cytosol, wild-type cells appeared to have roughly equal amounts in crude microsomes and crude cytosol, and countin– cells had most of the glucose-6-phosphatase activity in crude microsomes (Table 2). A comparison of the sum of the activities in crude microsomes and the activity in crude cytosol with the previously observed activity in cleared lysates (at the time the glucose-6-phosphatase activities were measured in the cell fractions, the activities in cleared lysates were also measured, and this latter activity matched previously published cleared lysate activity) suggests that separating crude cytosol from crude microsomes causes activity in one of the fractions to increase slightly (Table 2). This could be due to a component in the crude microsomal fraction inhibiting the activity of a phosphatase in the crude cytosol fraction or vice versa. However, if we consider the error at 114 μm glucose 6-phosphate to be roughly equal to the S.E. of the mean in our assays at 100 μm glucose 6-phosphate (Fig. 1 and Ref. 18Jang W. Gomer R.H. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the difference is not statistically significant. Detergent Increases the Vmax of Glucose-6-phosphatase in countin– Crude Microsomes—Because glucose-6-phosphatase is a multicomponent enzyme with catalytic and transporter subunits and with the catalytic subunit inside the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, one way to measure the activity of the catalytic subunit itself is to measure the glucose-6-phosphatase activity in detergent-disrupted microsomes (34Robbins B.L. Foster J.D. Nordlie R.C. Life Sci. 1991; 48: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We treated crude microsomes with detergent (0.1% Triton X-100) to determine whether the differences in the enzyme activity in crude microsomes of the three cell lines with different levels of CF accumulation are due to regulation of the transporter subunits. In smlA– cells, the discernable activities of the enzyme were quite similar with or without Triton X-100 treatment (Fig. 2A). Wild-type cells also had no discernable differences in the activity of the enzyme with or without Triton X-100 treatment (Fig. 2B). In countin– cells, treatment with Triton X-100 increased the Vmax of the glucose-6-phosphatase (Fig. 2C). Together, the data suggest that in smlA– and wild-type cells, detergent treatment to allow direct access of glucose 6-phosphate to the catalytic subunit does not increase enzymatic activity, suggesting that in these cell lysates the glucose 6-phosphate transporter does not limit enzyme activity. In countin– crude microsomes, the detergent treatment did increase glucose-6-phosphatase activity, suggesting that in this cell line the glucose-6-phosphatase activity is limited by the transporter. Fractionated Crude Cytosols from Wild-type and countin– Cells Affect the Glucose-6-phosphatase Activity of Wild-type Crude Microsomes—Having established that the glucose-6-phosphatase activities of smlA–, wild-type, and countin– cells are different when measured in crude microsomes, we then asked whether there exists any factors in the crude cytosol that regulate the glucose-6-phosphatase activity in crude microsomes. To identify CF-regulated components that affect the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in the crude cytosol, we fractionated the crude cytosol by using 10-kDa cutoff spin filters to generate S<10K and S>10K fractions and then measured the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase in crude microsomes with or without fractionated crude cytosol. Crude cytosol from smlA– cells was not used, since it had a very high glucose-6-phosphatase activity (Fig. 1B). The S<10K and the S>10K fractions from both wild-type and countin– cells had essentially undetectable glucose-6-phosphatase activities (data not shown). The glucose-6-phosphatase activity of wild-type crude microsomes resuspended in S<10K was not significantly different from the activity of wild-type crude microsomes resuspended in PB (data not shown). However, when wild-type crude microsomes were resuspended in S>10K from wild-type cells, the Km increased, and the Vmax of the enzyme decreased (Fig. 3A, Table 3). When unfractionated crude cytosol or reconstituted crude cytosol (a mixture of S>10K and S<10K) from wild-type cells was added to wild-type crude microsomes, glucose-6-phosphatase activities were restored to roughly the cleared lysate level (Fig. 3B). The data suggest that there is one or more factors in wild-type S>10K that decrease glucose-6-phosphatase activity and another factor(s) in wild-type S<10K that suppresses the activity of the factors in wild-type S>10K. The presence of S<10K from countin– cells did not alter the glucose-6-phosphatase activity of wild-type crude microsomes (data not shown), whereas S>10K from countin– cells decreased the Km of glucose-6-phosphatase in wild-type crude microsomes but had little effect on Vmax (Fig. 3C and Table 3). This effect was also seen using crude cytosol from countin– cells (data not shown). At the physiological level of glucose 6-phosphate in wild-type cells (∼114 μm), S>10K from countin– cells increased the activity of wild-type crude microsomes by ∼6-fold compared with the activity of wild-type crude microsomes resuspended in PB.TABLE 3One or more factors in S>10K regulates the Vmax and Km of glucose-6-phosphatase in wild-type crude microsomesControlWT S>10Kcountin- S>10KVmax (nmol/mg protein/min)0.960.220.90Km (mm)0.632.7<0.1 Open table in a new tab The Factors in Wild-type and countin– S>10K That Affect Microsomal Glucose-6-phosphatase Activity Are Destroyed by Heat or Protease Treatments—To determine the nature of the factors in the wild-type and countin– S>10Ks, we subjected the S>10K from wild-type or countin– cells to a variety of treatments. The treated wild-type or countin– S>10K was then added to wild-type microsomes. There was no decrease of the wild-type S>10K activity (the ability of the wild-type S>10K to decrease wild-type microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase activity at 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate) after 30-min treatments at 37 °C or 37 °C with DNase. There was an ∼70% decrease of the wild-type S>10K activity upon treatment of wild-type S>10K at 55 °C. When wild-type S>10K was heated to 100 °C for 5 min or treated with proteinase K agarose beads at 37 °C for 30 min, the wild-type S>10K activity was abolished. We were unable to measure the effect of RNase on wild-type S>10K, as this treatment caused severe turbidity when mixed with wild-type microsomes. There was no decrease of the countin– S>10K activity (the ability of the countin– S>10K to stimulate wild-type microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase activity at 0.1 mm glucose 6-phosphate) after treatment at 37 °C or at 37 °C with DNase or RNase. There was an ∼50% decrease of the countin– S>10K activity upon treatment at 55 °C for 30 min. The stimulating activity in the countin– S>10K was completely abolished with treatment at 100 °C for 5 min or incubation with proteinase K agarose beads at either 55 or 37 °C for 30 min. Together, the data suggest that the glucose-6-phosphatase-modulating activities in the wild-type and countin– S>10K are heat-labile proteins. Fractionated Crude Cytosols from Wild-type and countin– Cells Affect the Glucose-6-phosphatase Activity of Crude Microsomes from Rat Liver—To find out whether Dictyostelium S>10K has similar effects on mammalian glucose-6-phosphatase, crude microsomes from rats were resuspended in PB, wild-type S>10K, or countin– S>10K. The addition of wild-type (WT) and countin– S>10 to rat liver crude microsomes significantly decreased the Vmax and Km of the rat liver glucose-6-phosphatase (Fig. 4 and Table 4). However, the countin– S>10K decreased the Km more than the WT S>10K decreased the Km, suggesting that CF regulates a component in Dictyostelium S>10K that affects the Km of mammalian glucose-6-phosphatase.TABLE 4One or more factors in S>10K regulate the glucose-6-phosphatase in rat liver crude microsomesControlWT S>10Kcountin- S>10KVmax (nmol/mg protein/min)21.44.93.6Km (mm)1.91.00.24 Open table in a new tab Glucose-6-phosphatase is a crucial enzyme involved in glucose homeostasis.

The activity of glucose-6-phosphatase can be regulated through gene expression and/or biochemical inhibition (35Haber B.A. Chin S. Chuang E. Buikhuisen W. Naji A. Taub R. J. Clin.

Due to the importance and implication in diseases, considerable effort has been made to identify the regulation mechanism of this enzyme. However, the exact nature of glucose-6-phosphatase regulation is still largely unknown. The observation that glucose-6-phosphatase activities in crude microsomes from smlA–, wild-type, and countin– cells are different from the previously observed glucose-6-phosphatase activities in cleared lysates of the three cell lines suggested that there may exist factors or other nonspecific glucose-6-phosphatase activities in the crude cytosol and that interactions between factors in the crude cytosol and crude microsomes may regulate glucose-6-phosphatase activity in these cell lines. Numerous cytosolic phosphatases other than glucose-6-phosphatase such as alkaline phosphatase hydrolyze glucose 6-phosphate (for review, see Ref. 25Mithieux G. Rajas F. Gautier-Stein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44231-44234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The high glucose-6-phosphatase activity observed in the clarified lysates of smlA– cells and the glucose-6-phosphatase activity observed in the crude cytosol from wild-type and countin– cells may, thus, be due to cytosolic enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase or may be due to ineffective separation of the microsomes from the crude cytosol or solubilization of glucose-6-phosphatase. The finding that the presence of detergent (Triton X-100) increased glucose-6-phosphatase activity in countin– cells by increasing Vmax suggests that glucose-6-phosphatase, glucose, or phosphate transporter subunits limit the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in countin– cells and that the amount or Vmax of the catalytic subunit in countin– cells is higher than in wild-type or smlA– cells. This then suggests that CF regulates the amount or Vmax of the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit as well as the Km. We previously showed that internal glucose levels are elevated in countin– cells (17Jang W. Chiem B. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31972-31979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because glucose increases the expression levels of glucose-6-phosphatase mRNA in mammals (for review, see Ref. 24van Schaftingen E. Gerin I. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 513-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), it is possible that the increased activity of glucose-6-phosphatase in countin– cells is due to the elevated levels of internal glucose up-regulating glucose-6-phosphtase expression. In addition, metabolites of the glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathway can play an important role in the expression and inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase (34Robbins B.L. Foster J.D. Nordlie R.C. Life Sci. 1991; 48: 1075-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and we observed that cell lines with different levels of CF accumulation had different levels of metabolites (18Jang W. Gomer R.H. Eukaryot. Cell. 2005; 4: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Finally, the activity of glucose-6-phosphatase is inhibited by the presence of phosphatidylinositol kinase and its metabolites (33Mithieux G. Daniele N. Payrastre B. Zitoun C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the levels of one such metabolite, inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, are affected by CF. 4Y. Tang and R. H. Gomer, unpublished data. Therefore, it is possible that some of the differences in the activities of glucose-6-phosphatase in smlA–, wild-type, and countin– cells are due to differences in the amount of the enzyme present in cells or due to metabolites regulating the activity of the enzyme. We observed that S>10K from wild-type cells decreased the Vmax and increased the Km of glucose-6-phosphatase in wild-type crude microsomes, whereas crude cytosol or reconstituted cytosol from wild-type cells did not have such effects. In addition, wild-type S<10K did not have any significant effect on wild-type crude microsomes. Together, the data suggest that there is a factor in S>10K from wild-type cells that decreases Vmax and increases Km of glucose-6-phosphatase in wild-type crude microsomes, and the effect of this factor is suppressed by another factor in S<10K from wild-type cells. S>10K from countin– cells strongly decreased the Km of wild-type crude microsomes with little effect on the Vmax. Heat and protease treatment of the S>10Ks indicated that the activities are heat-labile proteins. There is, thus, a protein in the S>10K fraction of countin– cells that increases the activity rather than the level of glucose-6-phosphatase. Rat liver crude microsomes have a higher glucose-6-phosphatase activity than Dictyostelium crude microsomes. The addition of Dictyostelium wild-type and countin– S>10K greatly decreased the Vmax and Km of the rat liver glucose-6-phosphatase. However, the presence of countin– S>10K decreased the Km of mammalian glucose-6-phosphatase more than wild-type S>10K, suggesting that the CF-regulated protein in Dictyostelium S>10K that decreased the Km of Dictyostelium glucose-6-phosphatase is also effective on a mammalian glucose-6-phosphatase. Our working hypothesis is, thus, that extracellular CF inhibits the presence or activity of at least one protein in crude cytosol (Fig. 5). When extracellular CF levels are low, this factor increases glucose-6-phosphatase activity by decreasing the Km of the enzyme. Thus, at low CF levels, the high glucose-6-phosphatase activity increases intracellular glucose levels, which in turn increases cell-cell adhesion and decreases cell motility. An increase in CF levels would then cause glucose-6-phosphatase activity to decrease, and the resulting decreased cell-cell activity and increased motility would lead to stream breakup and allow a regulation of group and fruiting body size. We thank Drs. Jennifer West and Darrell Pilling for their kind gift of rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W2026174136,"Xenopus oocytes are arrested in prophase of the first meiotic division. In response to progesterone, they re-enter meiosis and arrest again in metaphase of the second meiotic division. This process, called meiotic maturation, is under the control of the Cyclin B–Cdc2 complex, M phase promoting factor (MPF). Injection of a constitutively active Xenopus H-Ras protein activates MPF, suggesting that Ras proteins could be implicated in the progesterone transduction pathway. The aim of this study was (1) to elucidate the pathway triggered by H-Ras leading to MPF activation in Xenopus oocytes and (2) to investigate whether endogenous H-Ras is involved in the physiological process of meiotic maturation. We generated three constitutively active double mutants, each of them recruiting a single effector in mammalian cells, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or RalGDS. Our results show that the activation of a PI3K-related enzyme is crucial for H-Ras-induced MPF activation, whereas the recruitment of either MAPK or RalGDS is not. However, although the H-Ras/PI3K pathway is functional in Xenopus oocytes, it is not the physiological transducer of progesterone responsible for meiotic resumption."

This effect has been attributed to direct blockade of NF-κB activation, as well as to increased activation of components of the apoptotic pathway and decreases in inhibitors of apoptosis. In this report we evaluated the mechanism by which E1A modulates the expression of the cytokine-inducible cytoprotective genes manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and ferritin heavy chain (FH). We observed that E1A blocks induction of MnSOD, IL-6, and FH by TNF-α or IL-1α. Because NF-κB plays a role in cytokine-dependent induction of MnSOD, IL-6, and FH, we assessed the effect of E1A on NF-κB in cells treated with TNF. IκB, the inhibitor of NF-κB, was degraded similarly in the presence and absence of E1A. TNF induced a quantitatively and temporally equivalent activation of NF-κB in control and E1A-transfected cells. However, TNF-dependent acetylation of NF-κB was diminished in cells expressing E1A. E1A mutants unable to bind p400 or the Rb family proteins were still capable of repressing TNF-dependent induction of FH. However, mutants of E1A that abrogated binding of p300/CBP blocked the ability of E1A to repress TNF-dependent induction of FH.

Binding of TNF to its receptor TNFR1 triggers both survival and death pathways. TNF recruits the adapter molecules TRADD and FADD, initiating a signaling cascade that culminates in apoptosis. Conversely, TRADD can also recruit TRAF2 and RIP, which promote survival by triggering the activation of NF-κB (see Refs. 3Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar and 4Liu Z.G. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar for review). Signaling events involved in the activation of NF-κB include recruitment of IκB kinase (IKK), resulting in the phosphorylation of the NF-κB inhibitory protein, IκB. IκB is then targeted for proteosome-mediated degradation, freeing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, where it transcriptionally induces target genes. The NF-κB family of transcription factors consists of 5 proteins that form homo- or heterodimers. The prototypical NF-κB complex is a heterodimer composed of RelA (p65) and p50. Recent work has revealed that the activity of NF-κB is modulated by post-translational modification as well as by subcellular localization. Thus phosphorylation and acetylation control the duration and amplitude of NF-κB signaling (5Schmitz M.L. Mattioli I. Buss H. Kracht M. Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) (6Chen L.F. Greene W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The activity of NF-κB is further modulated by association with histone acetylases and deacetylases. For example CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, a transcriptional coactivator and histone acetylase, interacts with the p65 subunit of NF-κB. Such an interaction is thought to increase the transcriptional activity of NF-κB both directly, through acetylation of NF-κB, and indirectly, through acetylation of histones. Interleukin-1α (IL-1) shares many of the biological activities of TNF (reviewed in Ref. 7Le J. Vilcek J. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 234-248PubMed Google Scholar) although it is structurally unrelated and binds to different cell receptors (8Beutler B.A. Cerami A. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3969-3971PubMed Google Scholar) (9Matsushima K. Akahoshi T. Yamada M. Furutani Y. Oppenheim J.J. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 4496-4502PubMed Google Scholar). Like TNF, IL-1 activates NF-κB. TNF and IL-1 induce expression of a common set of cellular genes including intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) in endothelial cells (10May M.J.

Commun. 1990; 169: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) in fibroblasts. Many genes induced by TNF via an NF-κB-dependent pathway serve a cytoprotective function. These include antiapoptotic genes such as IAP-1, IAP2, c-FLIP, and TRAF that inhibit the apoptotic process at the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) or the mitochondrion (17Varfolomeev E.E. Ashkenazi A. Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). IL-6 is essential for certain antiviral responses and the synthesis of acute phase proteins (reviewed in Ref. 18Kishimoto T. Clin. Rev. Allergy Immunol. 2005; 28: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Other cytoprotective genes induced by NF-κB inhibit oxidative stress. Such genes include MnSOD (19Djavaheri-Mergny M. Javelaud D. Wietzerbin J. Besancon F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and ferritin H (20Kwak E.L. Larochelle D.A. Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15285-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). MnSOD reduces levels of the superoxide radical produced as a byproduct of respiration. Ferritin, an iron storage protein, sequesters iron and prevents iron from participating in reactions that generate oxygen free radicals. Cytosolic ferritin is composed of two types of subunits, termed H and L that assemble to form a 24 subunit protein. The H subunit of ferritin possesses a ferroxidase activity that catalyzes the oxidation of iron into a ferrihydrite mineral core in the center of the protein. We have shown that activation of NF-κBbyTNF leads to the transcriptional induction of ferritin H via an NF-κB-containing element in the ferritin H promoter, which we term FER2 (20Kwak E.L. Larochelle D.A. Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15285-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Induction of ferritin H blunts the sustained phase of JNK activation required for the accumulation of ROS in TNF-treated cells, and is a critical component of the cytoprotective response to TNF (21Pham C.G. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Jones J. Alvarez K. Jayawardena S. De Smaele E. Cong R. Beaumont C. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Franzoso G. Cell. 2004; 119: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The balance between survival and apoptotic pathways induced by TNF can be modulated by the E1A oncogene. E1A is an immediate early gene of adenovirus with multiple effects, including sensitization of cells to TNF-induced apoptosis. Many of its effects are mediated by interaction and perturbations of important intracellular regulators, including the Rb tumor suppressor family (p107, p105Rb, and p130), the transcriptional coactivators and histone aceytylases p300 and CBP, the cell cycle regulator p21(WAF1) (22Chattopadhyay D. Ghosh M.K. Mal A. Harter M.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9844-9856Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the tumor suppressor p53 (23Zhang X. Hussain R. Turnell A.S. Mymryk J.S. Gallimore P.H. Grand R.J. Virology. 2005; 340: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), and a p400 chromatin remodeling complex (24Fuchs M. Gerber J. Drapkin R. Sif S. Ikura T. Ogryzko V. Lane W.S. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Cell. 2001; 106: 297-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this article, we demonstrate that E1A inhibits the induction of the survival genes ferritin H, MnSOD, and IL-6 by TNF and IL-1. We show that E1A exerts its activity on ferritin H by targeting an NF-κB binding domain of the ferritin H promoter and inhibiting the induction of ferritin H by TNF. However, although E1A inhibits the activity of NF-κB, E1A does not prevent the accumulation of NF-κB, its translocation to the nucleus, or its nuclear stability. However, E1A blocks TNF-dependent acetylation of NF-κB. Mapping experiments reveal that the p300 binding domain of E1A is critical to its ability to inhibit TNF-dependent induction of ferritin H. These results indicate that in cytokine-treated cells, E1A regulates the activity of NF-κB at the ferritin H promoter through binding and inactivation of p300, preventing p300 from acetylating NF-κB. These results suggest that p300 functions as a nodal point for functional regulation of NF-κB by modulating its ability to activate transcription of cytoprotective genes in cells treated with cytokines such as TNF. Cell Culture—Mouse fibroblast NIH3T3 parental cells as well as stable E1A and control vector NIH3T3 transfectants were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone). Isolation and construction of stable NIH3T3 transfectants expressing E1A or the Δ23–150 E1A deletion mutant were as described (25Tsuji Y. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1897-1907PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected IP1 cells (derived from SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cells) expressing either type Ad5 E1A (IP1/E1A) or a dysfunctional frameshifted E1A mutant (IP1/EFS) were kindly provided by M-C. Hung (University of Texas, Houston, TX). Plasmids—All E1A mutants and wild-type E1A plasmids used in these experiments are shown in Fig. 1. All mutants and their binding properties have been described in detail elsewhere (26Stein R.W. Corrigan M. Yaciuk P. Whelan J. Moran E. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4421-4427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wang H.G. Rikitake Y. Carter M.C. Yaciuk P. Abraham S.E. Zerler B. Moran E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 476-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Jelsma T.N. Howe J.A. Evelegh C.M. Cunniff N.F. Skiadopoulos M.H. Floroff M.R. Denman J.E. Bayley S.T. Virology. 1988; 163: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The FER2-minimal ferritin H promoter linked to human growth hormone (HGH) reporter plasmid (FER2-min/HGH) was constructed from previously described constructs of –0.941 kb ferritin H promoter-HGH and –5.6 kb ferritin H promoter-HGH (20Kwak E.L. Larochelle D.A. Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15285-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The TNF responsive element of the ferritin H gene, FER2, was amplified from the –5.6 kb construct by PCR, adding restriction sites for SphI and EcoRI. This element was then cloned into the SphI/EcoRI sites of the –0.941 kb construct to create the FER2/–0.941 kb/HGH construct. This construct was used to generate the FER2 minimal promoter construct (FER2-min/HGH) by digesting with EcoRI/MscI to delete an internal sequence of 886 bp. This was followed by fill-in and blunt-end ligation, resulting in a construct containing FER2 immediately 5′ of the 55-bp proximal promoter. To construct 4XFER2-FH-Luc, –4.8kbΔ3.5 FH-Luc (29Pietsch E.C. Chan J.Y. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2361-2369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) was digested with SmaI and MscI to create –0.059kb FH-Luc. Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to 2× FER2 were synthesized by the Wake Forest University School of Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center DNA synthesis facility, PAGE-purified, phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed, and ligated into the bunt-ended SmaI-MscI site of 0.059 kb FH-Luc. Clones expressing 4× FER2 were identified by restriction digestion. All constructs were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Transient Transfections—Transient transfections were carried out using electroporation or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). For electroporations, NIH3T3 cells were suspended in electroporation buffer described previously (20Kwak E.L. Larochelle D.A. Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15285-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) at a density of ∼1 × 107 cells per 0.6 ml of buffer. 1 × 107 cells were then transferred to ice-cold electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad) in which DNA was already present. Electroporations were carried out at 300 mV and 960 mF on a Bio-Rad gene pulser. The contents of the cuvettes were then resuspended into serum-containing media and distributed into 100-mm tissue culture plates. Cells were allowed to recover for 24 h prior to treatment with 10 ng/ml recombinant human TNF-α (R&D Systems) for 24 h. Control plates were left untreated. In transfections of 12SE1A mutants with the FER2-min/HGH construct, 20 μg of the FER2-min/HGH DNA and 30 μg of wild-type 12S E1A DNA were utilized. DNA concentrations of E1A mutants were adjusted to give E1A protein expression equivalent to that of wild-type E1A as determined by Western blotting. Empty pHygSRα vector DNA was added to each electroporation so that all cuvettes received an equal concentration of total DNA. For transfection experiments in which 13SE1A or 13SE1AΔ23–150 were used, 15 μg of plasmid DNA was used for each construct as well as for the FER2-min/HGH reporter construct. Transfections with Lipofectamine were carried out essentially as described (29Pietsch E.C. Chan J.Y. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2361-2369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) using Renilla luciferase vector as a transfection control. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were treated with recombinant human TNF-α or with recombinant human IL-1α (a gift from Hoffman-La Roche Inc.) and collected at the indicated time points. RNA was isolated by the method of Chirgwin et al. (30Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 4 m guanidium isothiocyanate, and total RNA was collected by ultracentrifugation through 5.7 m CsCl. Ferritin mRNA was analyzed by blotting using hybridization to cDNA from mouse ferritin H (31Torti S.V. Kwak E.L. Miller S.C. Miller L.L. Ringold G.M. Myambo K.B. Young A.P. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12638-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human ferritin L (32Boyd D. Vecoli C. Belcher D.M. Jain S.K. Drysdale J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11755-11761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (33Tsuji Y. Miller L.L. Miller S.C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7257-7261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA for human MnSOD was obtained from ATCC and mouse IL-6 from F. Lee (DNAX Research Inst., Palo Alto, CA). Gels were subjected to autoradiography and signal intensities quantified by scanning densitometry. RNase Protection Assay—All RNA prepared for use in RNase protection assays was collected as described for Northern blot analysis. RNA probe was prepared by in vitro transcription of a ferritin H-HGH template using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) and [α-32P]CTP (> 400Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) essentially as described (34Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4057) Google Scholar). The probe spans the junction between ferritin H and HGH and includes from nt –255 to +86 of ferritin H and the HindIII/DraIII fragment of HGH. Hybridization was carried out using 10 μg of total RNA and 1 × 106 cpm of RNA probe overnight at 56 °C in 80% formamide. Single-stranded RNAs were then digested with RNases A and T1 (both from Sigma). Remaining RNA was precipitated, and the products separated on a 6% denaturing urea-acrylamide gel. Results were quantitated by densitometry of phosphorimages on a Molecular Dynamics 445 SI phosphorimager. Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Extractions—Protein extractions were carried out essentially as described (35Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped from plates in phosphate-buffered saline/25 mm EDTA and pelleted at 4 °C by centrifugation. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, repelleted, and then resuspended in cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice. Cells were then lysed by pulse vortexing with addition of ∼6% v/v 10% Nonidet P-40 in high salt buffer (50 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclear pellets were collected, resuspended in the above high salt buffer and rocked for 30 min to extract nuclear proteins. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay system. Whole cell protein extracts for assessment of NF-κB acetylation were prepared by freeze-thaw lysis, as described (36Chen L.F. Greene W.C. Methods. 2005; 36: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—25 ng of consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide (Promega) was used for end-labeling by [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The assay was carried out as described (37Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar) with modifications. Binding reactions were carried out on ice using a mixture of 10 μg of nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dIdC), and between 100,000–250,000 cpm of radiolabeled oligonucleotide in a final volume to 20 μl. Where indicated, unlabeled oligonucleotide at a 100-fold molar excess was used as competitor. SP1 oligonucleotide (Promega) was used as a nonspecific competitor. In supershift experiments, antibodies against the p50 and p65 NF-κB family members (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or against nonspecific antibody for p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), were added where indicated and preincubated for 45 min prior to addition of competitors and probe. Samples were electrophoresed on a 5% native acrylamide gel containing 1.25% glycerol, fixed, and dried. Results were obtained by phosphorimaging and by radiography. Western Blotting—For E1A expression, 20–40 μg of nuclear extracts were separated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. E1A was detected using anti-E1A clone M58 (PharMingen), followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Calbiochem) and detection by enhanced chemiluminescense (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). For IκB expression 60 μg of cytoplasmic protein were used. Primary antibody incubations were carried out using anti IκB-α (Cell Signaling Technology) followed by HRP-conjugated-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) and detection with ECL Plus. Anti-acetylated K310 RelA(p65) antibody was a generous gift of Warner C. Greene (University of California, San Francisco), and anti-NF-κB p65 (C-20) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. These antibodies were used following electrophoresis of 50 μg of total cell lysate. Secondary antibody was HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) and detection was by ECL. Luciferase Assays—Cells were lysed in reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and dual luciferase assays carried out using the Luciferase Assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. E1A Inhibits TNF-dependent Induction of Ferritin H—To explore the influence of E1A on TNF-dependent gene expression, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with an E1A expression vector, pHygSRαE1A (NIH3T3/E1A), or with the empty vector pHygSRα (NIH3T3/Hyg) as a control, and stable transfectants were isolated. Stable E1A and hygromycin clones were either untreated or treated with TNF-α for 15 h, a time point that precedes cytotoxic effects of TNF in 3T3 cells (not shown). Both pooled and clonal transfectants were examined. As shown in Fig. 2, TNF treatment led to a marked induction of ferritin H mRNA in control cells. However, E1A blocked induction of ferritin H in both pooled and clonal transfectants. The ferritin L gene, which is neither induced by TNF (31Torti S.V. Kwak E.L. Miller S.C. Miller L.L. Ringold G.M. Myambo K.B. Young A.P. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12638-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), nor repressed by E1A (38Tsuji Y. Kwak E. Saika T. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7270-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was unaffected in these experiments (Fig. 2). E1A Inhibits IL-1-inducible Gene Expression—To test whether E1A inhibition is specific to TNF, we used a second cytokine, IL-1. Treatment of control 3T3 cells with IL-1 led to an induction of ferritin H mRNA (Fig. 3), as we have previously reported for human fibroblasts (33Tsuji Y. Miller L.L. Miller S.C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7257-7261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A robust induction was present at 4 h, with a gradual increase in mRNA levels up to 24 h. Ferritin L mRNA was not induced by IL-1, indicating that, like TNF, IL-1 exhibits a selective effect on gene expression. As we had observed in TNF-treated cells, E1A dramatically inhibited IL-1-dependent induction of ferritin H at all time points measured (Fig. 3). These results do not reflect a generalized repression of cellular genes by E1A, because the expression of ferritin L, which is not induced by IL-1, was equal in vector- and E1A-transfected NIH3T3 cells during this time course (Fig. 3). E1A Inhibits Induction of Multiple Cytokine-inducible Genes—To test whether E1A-mediated inhibition of IL-1 inducible gene expression was specific to the ferritin H gene, we examined the cytokine-inducible genes MnSOD and IL-6. As seen in Fig. 3, MnSOD and IL-6 genes were dramatically induced in response to treatment with IL-1α. As observed with ferritin H, introduction of wild-type 13 S E1A completely blocked IL-1α-dependent induction of MnSOD and IL-6 in NIH3T3 cells (NIH3T3/E1A) at all time points measured. E1A Does Not Inhibit Nuclear Translocation of NF-κB—One potential mechanism by which E1A might repress cytokine-mediated induction of multiple genes is through interference with NF-κB, a stress-activated transcription factor that has been identified as mediating the induction of multiple genes in response to TNF or IL-1, including MnSOD (19Djavaheri-Mergny M. Javelaud D. Wietzerbin J. Besancon F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), IL-6 (39Legrand-Poels S. Schoonbroodt S. Piette J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and ferritin H (20Kwak E.L. Larochelle D.A. Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15285-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 21Pham C.G. Bubici C. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Jones J. Alvarez K. Jayawardena S. De Smaele E. Cong R. Beaumont C. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Franzoso G. Cell. 2004; 119: 529-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Because activation of NF-κB can be blocked by inhibiting the activation of IKK (IκB-kinase), we first assessed effects of E1A on TNF-dependent IκB degradation in NIH3T3. As shown in Fig. 4, IκB was degraded following TNF treatment of NIH3T3 cells regardless of whether or not they expressed E1A. These results indicate that E1A does not inhibit IκB degradation in response to TNF in NIH3T3 cells. Because the transcriptional activity of NF-κB also depends on its subunit composition and ability to reach the nucleus, we next tested whether E1A inhibited nuclear targeting of NF-κB. NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with the pHygSRα control vector (NIH3T3/Hyg) or the E1A expression vector, pHygSRα/E1A vector (NIH3T3/E1A) were treated with TNF and EMSA for NF-κB were performed at intervals ranging from 15 min to 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5, NF-κB was activated to similar levels in both control and E1A vector-transfected NIH3T3 cells at all time points. In three independent time course experiments, peak activation of NF-κB by TNF occurred at 30 min in both E1A transfectants and controls. Fold increase in NF-κB binding activity at this time was 24 ± 8 (mean ± S.E.) for controls and 27 ± 7 for E1A transfectants, indicating that E1A has no effect on the time course or magnitude of NF-κB activation. Further, as shown in Fig. 6, supershift analysis using anti-p50 and p65 NF-κB antibodies demonstrated the presence of both p50 and p65 NF-κB subunits in activated NF-κB, and indicated that E1A did not demonstrably affect this composition. In particular, levels of p50, which can homodimerize to inhibit transcription, were not increased by E1A: quantification of 4 supershift analyses demonstrated that 45 ± 16% (mean ± S.E.) of NF-κB binding activity could be super-shifted by anti-p50 antibody in control cells, whereas 41 ± 10% was supershifted in E1A transfectants.FIGURE 6NF-κB in nuclear extracts from control and E1A-transfected NIH3T3 cells is composed of p65 and p50 subunits. Electrophoretic mobility supershift assay of NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with either control vector (NIH3T3/HYG) or with E1A expression vector (NIH3T3/E1A), and either treated with 10 ng/ml TNF or not for 4 h. 10 μg of nuclear protein were incubated with 32P-labeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide probe. Unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide was included as a specific competitor and unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide as a nonspecific competitor. Antibodies against NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 RelA or a nonspecific antibody (p53) (NS) were added where indicated. Arrow indicates activated NF-κB and asterisk indicates supershifted complexes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) E1A Directly Inhibits the Activity of NF-κB—We have previously shown that TNF-dependent induction of ferritin H requires a cis-acting element of the ferritin H gene, which we termed FER2. FER2 consists of two tandem NF-κB consensus elements that both bind NF-κB (20Kwak E.L. Larochelle D.A. Beaumont C. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15285-15293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, FER2 ligated to a minimal ferritin H promoter (FER2-FH) was induced following treatment of cells with TNF (Fig. 7). This indicates that the NF-κB binding domain of the ferritin promoter is both necessary and sufficient for induction of ferritin H by TNF. To test whether E1A targets this region of the ferritin promoter, we cotransfected cells with FER2-FH and an expression plasmid for E1A. As shown in Fig. 7, TNF-dependent induction of this construct was effectively inhibited by E1A. Thus, despite the inability of E1A to directly inhibit nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Fig. 5), E1A functionally interfered with the activity of NF-κB at the ferritin H promoter.
