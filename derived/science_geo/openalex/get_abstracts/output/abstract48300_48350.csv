https://openalex.org/W1997101537,"A defective LDL receptor gene in a child with familial hypercholesterolemia produces a receptor precursor that is 50,000 daltons larger than normal (apparent Mr 170,000 vs. 120,000). The elongated protein resulted from a 14 kilobase duplication that encompasses exons 2 through 8. The duplication arose from an unequal crossing-over between homologous repetitive elements (Alu sequences) in intron 1 and intron 8. The mutant receptor has 18 contiguous cysteine-rich repeat sequences instead of the normal nine. Seven of these duplicated repeats are derived from the ligand-binding domain, and two repeats are part of the epidermal growth factor precursor homology region. The elongated receptor undergoes normal carbohydrate processing, its apparent molecular weight increases to 210,000, and the receptor reaches the cell surface where it binds reduced amounts of LDL but undergoes efficient internalization and recycling. The current findings support an evolutionary model in which homologous recombination between repetitive elements in introns leads to exon duplication during evolution of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1484814483,"The alveolar type II cell which synthesizes and secretes surfactant also plays a major role in the reuptake of surfactant lipids. In a recent in vivo study we found that the subfractions of natural surfactant that contained the surfactant protein with molecular weights of 26,000-36,000 (SP-26-36) were preferentially taken up into lamellar bodies of type II cells to a greater extent than were fractions that did not contain SP-26-36. Because the subfractions of natural surfactant in that study differed in other properties than the presence or absence of SP-26-36, the current study was undertaken to determine whether purified SP-26-36 enhanced the uptake of surfactant-like lipids by freshly isolated type II cells. SP-26-36 increased the uptake of label in radioactive surfactant-like lipids by up to 10-fold, and the effect of SP-26-36 was dependent on time, protein concentration, and temperature. The enhancement was inhibited by heat-treating the protein, by a polyclonal antibody against SP-26-36, and by metabolic inhibitors. The distribution of radioactivity in cell-associated phospholipids differed if cells were incubated with or without SP-26-36. If SP-26-36 was present during the incubation, greater than 96% of the radioactivity remained associated with phosphatidylcholine. In the absence of SP-26-36, only 85% of the radioactivity remained associated with phosphatidylcholine and 7% of the label appeared in phosphatidylglycerol. We hypothesize that SP-26-36 may act as a ligand to direct surfactant lipids to type II cells, perhaps to different metabolic pathways, and to regulate recycling and surfactant homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1550344038,"Abstract Fibroblasts organize the modular cell-adhesive glycoprotein fibronectin into a highly structured pericellular matrix by poorly understood mechanisms. Previous studies implicated an amino-terminal domain in matrix assembly and suggested that fibronectin's cell-adhesive domain and the corresponding fibroblast receptor were not involved in this process. To further elucidate the fibronectin region(s) involved in matrix assembly, we mapped a library of proteolytic fragments and antibodies to various fibronectin domains. The fragments and antibodies were used to probe the role of fibronectin's amino-terminal and cell-adhesive domains in a fibroblast matrix assembly assay. We found that fibronectin fragments including the first 25-kDa sequence of fibronectin and antibodies to amino-terminal domains inhibited pericellular matrix assembly. Polyclonal antibodies to the 40-kDa collagen binding domain following the 25-kDa amino-terminal domain also inhibited matrix assembly. However, collagen binding is not required for matrix assembly as neither monoclonals blocking collagen binding nor purified collagen binding domains themselves inhibited matrix assembly. Therefore, the amino-terminal region of fibronectin contains a site important in matrix assembly, and most activity is present in the first 25-kDa of fibronectin. Fibronectin's cell-adhesive domain and the fibroblast receptor binding to this domain also play an important role in fibronectin matrix assembly. Apart from a monoclonal antibody to the amino-terminal domain, only monoclonal antibodies binding to fibronectin's cell-adhesive domain and inhibiting cell adhesion also inhibited matrix assembly. In addition a 105-kDa fragment containing the cell-adhesive domain inhibited matrix assembly. We conclude that at least two discrete and widely separated sites in fibronectin with different binding properties--the carboxyl-terminal fibroblast cell-adhesive domain and an amino-terminal matrix assembly domain localized primarily within the first 25 kDa--are required for fibronectin pericellular matrix assembly by fibroblasts. Fibronectin's cell-adhesive domain and its cell surface-receptor complex appear to be involved in the matrix assembly process prior to a step involving the amino-terminal domain. We believe that this step is likely to be the initiation of cell-associated fibronectin fibril formation by the fibronectin-adhesive-receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1601913333,"Smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase contains a 64 residue sequence that binds calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Guerriero, V., Jr., Russo, M. A., and Means, A. R. (1987) Biochemistry, in press). Within this region is a sequence with homology to the corresponding sequence reported for the calmodulin binding region of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase (Blumenthal, D. K., Takio, K., Edelman, A. M., Charbonneau, H., Titani, L., Walsh, K. A., and Krebs, E. G. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 3187-3191). Inspection of these sequences reveals that they both share a similar number and spatial arrangement of basic residues with those present in the myosin light chain substrate. We have synthesized a 22-residue peptide corresponding to residues 480-501 (determined from the cDNA) of the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase. This peptide, Ala-Lys-Lys-Leu-Ser-Lys-Asp-Arg-Met-Lys-Lys-Tyr-Met-Ala-Arg-Arg-Lys-Trp- Gln-Lys-Thr-Gly, inhibited calmodulin-dependent activation of the smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase with an IC50 of 46 nM. At saturating concentrations of calmodulin, the 22-residue peptide inhibited myosin light chain and synthetic peptide substrate phosphorylation competitively with IC50 values of 2.7 and 0.9 microM, respectively. An 11-residue synthetic peptide analog, corresponding to part of the calmodulin-binding sequence in skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, Lys-Arg-Arg-Trp-Lys-Lys-Asn-Phe-Ile-Ala-Val, also competitively inhibited synthetic peptide substrate phosphorylation with a Ki of 1 microM. The competitive inhibitory activity of the calmodulin binding regions is similar to the apparent Km of 2.7 microM for phosphorylation of the 23-residue peptide analog of the smooth muscle myosin light chain and raises the possibility that the calmodulin binding region of the myosin light chain kinase may act as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1559740306,"The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) binds to plasma lipoproteins and promotes transfer of cholesteryl esters between the lipoproteins. CETP has been purified 55,000-fold, with a 27% recovery of activity, from the d greater than 1.21 g/ml fraction of human plasma. In the final purification step, partially purified CETP is incubated with a synthetic lipid emulsion consisting of phosphatidylcholine, triglyceride, and fatty acid, and the bound activity, which elutes in the void volume, is separated from nonbound proteins by gel filtration on Sepharose 4B. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel analysis of fractions containing bound activity shows the presence of a single protein with an apparent Mr of 74,000. Inclusion of fatty acid in this emulsion was required to prevent the binding of a contaminant protein. However, incubation of CEPT with fatty acid emulsions containing lipid peroxides resulted in substantial inactivation and covalent degradation of the 74-kDa protein. This could be prevented by the inclusion of antioxidants during preparation of the emulsion. Solvent extraction of emulsion-bound CEPT gave a delipidated, active preparation. Purified IgG from a rabbit immunized with the 74-kDa protein completely removed activity from partially purified fractions. Amino acid analysis of the purified protein showed it to contain an unusually high content (45%) of nonpolar residues; the calculated hydrophobicity was greater than that of any other plasma apolipoprotein. These results show human CETP to be a unique plasma apolipoprotein with an apparent Mr of 74,000 which is hydrophobic, self-associating, and susceptible to covalent degradation by lipid peroxides."

https://openalex.org/W1504130896,"Abstract Cellular retinol-binding protein (type II) (CRBP(II)), a newly described retinol-binding protein, is present in the small intestinal absorptive cell at high levels. Retinol (vitamin A alcohol) presented as a complex with CRBP(II) was found here to be esterified by microsomal preparations from rat small intestinal mucosa. The esterification observed utilized an endogenous acyl donor(s) and produced retinyl esters containing linoleate, oleate, palmitate, and stearate in a proportion quite similar to that previously reported for retinyl esters in lymph and isolated chylomicrons of rat. No dependence on endogenous or exogenous acyl-CoA could be demonstrated. The apparent Km for retinol-CRBP(II) in the reaction with endogenous acyl donor was 2.4 X 10(-7) M. Retinol presented as a complex with CRBP(II) was esterified more than retinol presented as a complex with cellular retinol-binding protein or retinol-binding protein, two other proteins known to bind retinol in vivo, but about the same as retinol presented bound to bovine serum albumin or beta-lactoglobulin. The ability of protein-bound retinol to be esterified was related to accessibility of the hydroxyl group, as judged by the ability of alcohol dehydrogenase to oxidize the bound retinol. However, whereas retinol bound to CRBP(II) was unavailable for esterification in any acyl-CoA-dependent reaction, retinol bound to bovine serum albumin was rapidly esterified in a reaction utilizing exogenous acyl-CoA. The results suggest that one of the functions of CRBP(II) is to accept retinol after it is absorbed or generated from carotenes in the small intestine and present it to the appropriate esterifying enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1595529083,"The phospholipid- and calcium-dependent protein kinase C has been shown to autophosphorylate on both the catalytic and the regulatory domains. The autophosphorylation displays zero-order kinetics, indicating that it is an intramolecular event. Autophosphorylation increases the activity of protein kinase C by decreasing the Km for the substrate H1 histone. The catalytic fragment obtained by limited proteolysis can no longer autophosphorylate and has a reduced affinity for H1 histone, exhibiting a Km 5-fold higher than that of the intact enzyme. Monoclonal antibodies produced against the enzyme can distinguish between the catalytic fragment and the intact enzyme by inhibiting their activities in a specific manner. Evidence suggesting that dimerization of protein kinase C occurs upon activation is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1557154008,"In this paper we report on the allosteric regulation of the dimeric flavoprotein methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (E.C. 1.5.1.20) by the inhibitor, AdoMet, and by one of the substrates, NADPH. These metabolites play antagonistic roles in this regulation, with NADPH recruiting active forms of the enzyme and AdoMet recruiting inactive forms. At high NADPH concentrations, activity dependence on AdoMet is sigmoidal, indicating cooperativity. The kinetics of inhibition induced by AdoMet are slow enough to be studied by conventional methods and exhibit marked biphasicity. Both the extents and rates of these phases are again affected antagonistically by the ligands, AdoMet increasing the extent of the faster phase, and NADPH decreasing the extent of the faster phase and the rate of the slower phase. We present a model consistent with these observations. Our model postulates two states of the enzyme, R and T. NADPH and AdoMet exhibit antagonistic binding to a given subunit, so that occupancy by one ligand decreases or abolishes affinity for the other ligand. However, within a given state, the subunits do not interact with each other, so the ligation of one does not affect the affinities of its neighbor. R-T transitions occur between all similarly ligated states. The ligands have different affinities for the R and T states, and AdoMet binding to a given subunit is measurably slow. This model predicts the observed features of the equilibrium and kinetic data noted above. We also present a system for simulation of reaction schemes in which each step is pseudo first order that is fast and versatile enough to allow least squares fitting of microscopic rate constants to kinetic data."
https://openalex.org/W2055762046,"Gap junctions isolated from rat liver were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. A channel activity that was directly dependent on voltage was recorded. Changes of pH and (Ca2+) had no direct effect on channel activity; however, they modulated the voltage-dependent gating of the gap junction channels differently. Single-channel fluctuations showed large scatter with peak amplitudes of 140 and 280 picoSiemmens in 0.1 M NaCl. The major protein of gap junctions (Mr of 27 kd) was also reconstituted into bilayers, giving channel properties similar to those of intact gap junctions. Polyclonal antibodies specific for this protein caused inhibition of the junctional conductance in bilayers. These data provide direct evidence that the 27 kd protein is the molecular species responsible for gap junction communication between cells."
https://openalex.org/W1602330165,"We have examined the effect of ethanol administration on receptor-mediated endocytosis of asialo-orosomucoid by isolated hepatocytes. Significantly less ligand was bound, internalized, and degraded by hepatocytes isolated from rats fed an ethanol diet for 5-7 weeks than by cells isolated from chow-fed or pair-fed controls. Reduced binding was shown to be primarily due to a decreased number of cell surface receptors rather than to a lowered affinity of the receptor for its ligand. This reduction in cell surface receptors resulted in a marked inhibition of internalization and degradation of ligand by hepatocytes from the ethanol-fed rats. In addition, a defect in the initial stages of receptor-ligand internalization was also indicated, since less surface-bound ligand was internalized and subsequently degraded in cells from the ethanol-treated animals as compared to controls. Rates of internalization and degradation of internalized ligand were, however, similar for all three groups, suggesting that neither degradation per se nor rate of delivery of internalized ligand to the lysosomes was affected by ethanol feeding. Receptor recycling was impaired in ethanol-fed rats, as indicated by a decrease in the binding site number after stimulation of endocytosis for 120 min when compared to initial binding capacity. Receptor recycling was not impaired in hepatocytes from control animals. These results indicate that chronic ethanol feeding impairs the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis by the liver; the major cause of this impairment appears to be due to a decreased number of cell surface asialoglycoprotein receptors in the ethanol-fed animals, along with a decreased ability of these cells to internalize all of the surface-bound ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1497724225,"Using an N-bromosuccinimide cleavage fragment of histone H1 as a relatively specific substrate for protein kinase C, we evaluated the partitioning of this kinase activity between soluble and particulate cellular fractions in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. In confluent, serum-deprived cells, protein kinase C activity was approximately equally divided between soluble and detergent-extractable particulate fractions; both rapidly growing and transformed cells appeared to contain higher levels of particulate enzyme activity. Soluble protein kinase C activity and immunoreactivity decreased to virtually undetectable levels after exposure of the cells to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), associated with a commensurate increase in particulate kinase activity and immunoreactivity. In intact cells, PMA appeared to cause a shift of immunoreactive protein kinase C from the cytosol to the perinuclear region, as assessed by immunofluorescent microscopy; however; subcellular fractionation revealed that PMA caused increases in the protein kinase C activity associated primarily with non-nuclear membranes. Exposure of the cells to sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol resulted in a modest and transient membrane association of protein kinase C, whereas platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and bombesin caused no detectable increases in the membrane association of the kinase. Activation of protein kinase C by growth factors in fibroblasts may occur without the gross disturbances in intracellular kinase location which occur in response to phorbol esters."
https://openalex.org/W1580280463,"A rat ceruloplasmin cDNA clone was isolated from a rat liver cDNA library and identified by partial nucleotide sequence analysis. Rat liver ceruloplasmin mRNA levels were measured during the acute phase response to inflammation by cytoplasmic dot hybridization to ceruloplasmin cDNA. Regulation of ceruloplasmin synthesis appeared to be at the mRNA level, with the concentration of ceruloplasmin mRNA increasing significantly 12 h after induction of inflammation, reaching a maximum of 350% of normal at 36 h and returning to normal levels within 60 h. Using Northern blot analysis, extrahepatic ceruloplasmin gene expression was observed in choroid plexus, yolk sac, placenta, and testis. All these tissues are at the interface between, and possibly involved in maintaining homeostasis in, adjacent extracellular compartments. No ceruloplasmin mRNA was detected in RNA from stomach and small intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1586269508,"The effect of spermidine and spermine on the translation of the mRNAs for ornithine decarboxylase and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase was studied using a reticulocyte lysate system and specific antisera to precipitate these proteins. It was found that the synthesis of these key enzymes in the biosynthesis of polyamines was much more strongly inhibited by the addition of polyamines than was either total protein synthesis or the synthesis of albumin. Translation of the mRNA for S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase was maximal in a lysate which had been substantially freed from polyamines by gel filtration. Addition of 80 microM spermine had no significant effect on total protein synthesis and stimulated albumin synthesis but reduced the production of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by 76%. Similarly, addition of 0.8 mM spermidine reduced the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase by 82% while albumin and total protein synthesis were similar to that found in the gel-filtered lysate. Translation of ornithine decarboxylase mRNA was greater in the gel-filtered lysate than in the control lysate but synthesis of ornithine decarboxylase was stimulated slightly by low concentrations of polyamines and was maximal at 0.2 mM spermidine or 20 microM spermine. Higher concentrations were strongly inhibitory with a 70% reduction occurring at 0.8 mM spermidine or 150 microM spermine. Further experiments in which both polyamines were added together confirmed that the synthesis of ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases were much more sensitive to inhibition by polyamines than protein synthesis as a whole. These results indicate that an important part of the regulation of polyamine biosynthesis by polyamines is due to a direct inhibitory effect of the polyamines on the translation of mRNA for these biosynthetic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1602419259,"A P-450, designated P-450a, with high testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was purified from rat liver microsomes. Specific polyclonal antibody against this P-450 was used to screen a lambda gt11 expression cDNA library and a 1687-base pair cDNA was isolated and sequenced. The deduced protein had 492 amino acids, a calculated Mr of 56,016, and it shared 51 and 45% amino acid similarities to P-450e and P-450f, respectively. Regions of similarity were distributed in distinct areas of high and low similarity along the P-450a primary sequence. P-450a cDNA was introduced into yeast cells using the expression vector pAAH5, and the resultant yeast microsomes contained both a protein of identical electrophoretic mobility to that of rat P-450a and testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. These results confirm enzyme reconstitution data and antibody inhibition data that P-450a possesses testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. The antibody and cDNA probes were used to examine the mechanism of regulation of P-450a by inducers and during development. P-450a and its mRNA were present at low level in newborn rats and increased to maximal level at 1 week of age in both males and females. At age 12 weeks, however, the P-450a level decreased in males but remained elevated in females. Concomitant with the decrease in P-450a in adult males was an increase in level of another immunologically related P-450. In adult male rats, P-450a was induced almost 5-fold by administration of 3-methylcholanthrene and this induction was the result of an increase in its mRNA. These results establish testosterone 7 alpha-hydroxylase as a member of the P-450e gene family that is developmentally regulated, sex-dependent, and markedly inducible by 3-methylcholanthrene."
https://openalex.org/W2042668096,"Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells selected simultaneously with N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) and methotrexate (MTX) gave rise to doubly resistant colonies at frequencies 20 to 260 times greater than the product of the independent frequencies found with PALA or MTX alone. Double resistance was due to amplification of both target genes, CAD and DHFR. Four independent doubly resistant ""MP"" lines were selected and characterized. Cells resistant to coformycin, pyrazofurin, or ouabain were generated from all four MP lines at rates up to 25 times greater than the rates for BHK cells. These three drugs select cells that have amplified the genes for their target enzymes. Therefore, we conclude that the four MP lines have an amplificator phenotype. All four grew much more slowly than BHK cells, indicating that the amplificator phenotype may be linked to significant defects in metabolism or cell division."
https://openalex.org/W1604232880,"An octadecapeptide capable of inducing pigment dispersion in the chromatophores of the fiddler crab Uca pugilator has been isolated from lyophilized heads of the lubber grasshopper Romalea microptera. This pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) was purified by gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, partition chromatography, and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Automated gas-phase sequencing, followed by the identification of the carboxyl-terminal amide, established the primary structure of this PDF as Asn-Ser-Glu-Ile-Ile-Asn-Ser-Leu-Leu-Gly-Leu-Pro-Lys-Leu-Leu-Asn-Asp-Ala- NH2. This structure was confirmed by chemical synthesis and by demonstrating that the synthetic and native PDF displayed identical chromatographic behavior and biological activity. The Romalea PDF is structurally related to the crustacean pigment-dispersing hormones (PDHs), which are also octadecapeptides. The sequence of grasshopper PDF shows 78% homology with beta-PDH (from the crabs U. pugilator and Cancer magister) and 50% homology with alpha-PDH (from the prawn Pandalus borealis). This study provides the first direct chemical evidence for the structural relatedness of insect PDF to the crustacean PDHs, thus identifying them as an authentic family of arthropod peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1508219985,"This study tested the hypothesis that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) and its previously described cardiac receptors play roles in regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis in cardiac muscle cells. This question was addressed by assessing whether 1,25-(OH)2D3 influences 45Ca2+ uptake by homogeneous cultures of adult rat ventricular cardiac muscle cells. Twenty-four h prior to the measurement of 45Ca2+ uptake, the cells were transferred to serum-free medium ([Ca2+], 1.0 mM) containing 1.0 nM 1,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle. The cells were then incubated with 45Ca2+ for periods up to 60 min at room temperature, followed by removal of excess external 45Ca2+ by washing repeatedly with La3+. Pretreating the cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused 3-fold stimulation (p less than 0.005) of 45Ca2+ uptake. Stimulation of 45Ca2+ uptake required a prolonged (8-12 h) exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3, suggesting a receptor-mediated phenomenon. Concentrations of 0.01-10 nM 1,25-(OH)2D3 yielded a dose-response curve which peaked at 1.0 nM and decreased at higher concentrations. Steroid specificity was established by the failure of 1.0 nM levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, estradiol-17 beta, and progesterone to change 45Ca2+ uptake. Sucrose gradient analysis confirmed the presence of a specific 3-4 S 3H-1,25-(OH)2D3 binding component both in freshly isolated and in cultured ventricular cardiac muscle cells. The stimulatory effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on 45Ca2+ uptake was abolished by the concomitant incubation of the cells with cycloheximide or actinomycin D, demonstrating a requirement for protein and nucleic acid synthesis. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulates 45Ca2+ uptake in adult ventricular cardiac muscle cells by a mechanism resembling a receptor-mediated phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1575874096,"The response of cytosolic calcium [Ca2+]i to angiotensin II (AII) and potassium (K+) in individual rat glomerulosa cells was determined using the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye, fura-2 and digital imaging. Control (4 mM K+) cytosolic calcium levels were generally in the 80-120 nM range and increased monotonically as [K+] was increased from 4 to 12 mM. There was no delay in the onset of the response. In most cells the [Ca2+]i decreased from its peak after 3-4 min, even in the presence of superfusate containing elevated K+. The time course of the change in [Ca2+]i in response to AII stimulation, on the other hand, was more variable. It was most often characterized by an early decrease followed by a large delayed increase. The response also was observed to decline during sustained AII stimulation. The majority of the cells showed some response to one or the other secretagogue with a sizeable minority (25%) having an increase in [Ca2+]i in excess of 200%. While the majority showed a response, the cell to cell variation was substantial. Finally, the pattern of cytosolic calcium increase sometimes showed a marked dependence on the secretagogue used, with different regions of the same cell being more strongly affected by one agent or the other. A few cells (10%) responded to AII only at one pole, establishing a large concentration gradient of calcium across the cell. Because of differences in time course, pattern, and degree of responsiveness, it is likely that the mechanisms underlying the Ca2+ elevation with K+ and AII are different."
https://openalex.org/W1578759258,"A potent endonuclease identified in a crude fraction of soluble proteins from bovine heart mitochondria has been purified 2500-fold and partially characterized. Physical studies of the enzyme indicate a Stokes radius of 30.3 A and a sedimentation coefficient, S20 degrees, w, of 4.1 yielding a native molecule weight of 59,000 and a frictional coefficient of 1.2. Analysis of extensively purified fractions by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals a major band at 29,000 Da accounting for 50% of the total protein and suggesting a dimeric subunit structure. The endonuclease maintains two distinct pH optima: pH 5.1-5.5 and 7-8. Both acid and neutral activities nick supercoiled M13 circular double-stranded replicative form I DNA and fragment single-stranded DNA templates to generate 5'-phosphoryl-3'-hydroxyl breaks. The endonuclease requires a divalent cation (preferring Mn2+ over Mg2+) and is sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide and moderate levels of salt. Analysis of the digestion products of double-stranded DNA after prolonged nuclease treatment yields a mixture of oligonucleotides, 13% of which are di- and trinucleotides. Despite the enzyme's ability to degrade DNA to oligonucleotides under some conditions, a strikingly nonrandom pattern of cleavage is observed when a restriction fragment composed of bovine D-loop DNA is used as a template. In this case, a strong preference for guanine tracts is seen."
https://openalex.org/W1593155668,"A rapid and sensitive method for assignment of disulfide bonds using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry is described for hen egg white lysozyme and bovine ribonuclease A. The protein is initially digested to a mixture of peptides using chemical and enzymatic methods under conditions which minimize disulfide bond reduction and exchange. The digested sample is analyzed directly by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry before and after chemical reduction of cystine residues. An important feature of the method is that it is not necessary to completely resolve the peptides in the digest chromatographically prior to analysis. The disulfide-containing peptides are also characterized directly by prolonged exposure of the sample to the high energy xenon atom beam which results in the reduction of cystine residues. Intra- as well as interchain disulfide bond assignments are made on the basis of the mass difference between the molecular ions (MH+) of the oxidized and reduced peptides. Confirmation of the mass assignments may be obtained from the mass spectra of the digests after one cycle of manual Edman degradation. Although the quantity of protein required to unambiguously assign all of the disulfide linkages will depend on the ease with which the appropriate peptide fragments can be formed, results from these studies indicate that approximately 1 nmol of protein is usually sufficient."
https://openalex.org/W1480624564,"Two polypeptide chain initiation factors, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) and guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), were isolated from rat liver. Two forms of eIF-2 were identified, one contained three subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma), and the other contained only the alpha- and gamma-subunits. The three-subunit form was similar to eIF-2 from rabbit reticulocytes with respect to the sedimentation coefficient, Stokes radius, molecular weight of the alpha- and gamma-subunits, ability to restore protein synthesis in hemin-deficient reticulocyte lysate, and immunological cross-reactivity of the alpha-subunits using antibodies against liver eIF-2. In contrast, the beta-subunits of the liver and reticulocyte factors were distinct; they had different molecular weights, and antibodies against rat liver eIF-2 beta did not recognize the beta-subunit of the reticulocyte factor. Furthermore, the GDP dissociation constant for reticulocyte eIF-2 was more than twice that of the liver factor. GEF from rat liver reversed GDP inhibition of the ternary complex assay and catalyzed the exchange of eIF-2-bound GDP for free GDP or GTP, characteristics ascribed to the corresponding protein from rabbit reticulocytes. However, its subunit composition and molecular weight were different from those reported for reticulocyte GEF. The T1/2 for GDP exchange mediated by GEF was about 5-fold slower with two-subunit than with three-subunit eIF-2. In addition, the KD for GDP was lower for two-subunit than for three-subunit eIF-2 when GEF was present. Taken together, these data demonstrate species-associated variability in the beta-subunit of eIF-2 and suggest a crucial role for the beta-subunit in the functional interaction of eIF-2 and GEF."
https://openalex.org/W1530095610,"Messenger RNA for hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.4) was partially purified from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from bovine pineal glands by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The enriched mRNA was used to prepare a cDNA library by use of expression vector lambda gt11. The library was screened with monoclonal antibodies to the enzyme, and three cDNA clones were isolated. These cloned cDNAs cross-hybridized with one another, and their fusion proteins reacted to the monoclonal antibodies with different binding properties. Hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase enzymatic activity was demonstrated in the bacteria lysate infected with lambda HIOMT-A16, the clone that contained the longest insert. An almost full-length cDNA clone was isolated from lambda gt10 cDNA library by use of the lambda HIOMT-A16 cDNA as a probe. The primary structure of hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase was determined by analyzing the nucleotide sequence of the cDNAs. It consisted of 1939 nucleotides including a 1050-nucleotide region coding for 350 amino acids. RNA transfer blot analysis indicated that mRNA encoding hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase was present only in the pineal gland and not in the brain, retina, and liver of cow."
https://openalex.org/W1568149310,"The mitochondrial gene for the cytochrome b of Complex III has been cloned from a mouse L-cell mutant with increased resistance to 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide and other inhibitors which block reactions at the b562 heme group. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that this gene contained a G:A transition on the coding strand at position 14,830. At the amino acid level, this mutation results in the substitution of an aspartic acid residue for a conserved glycine at position 231 of cytochrome b. Based upon current models for the secondary structure of cytochrome b, the altered amino acid lies in close proximity to one of the invariant histidine residues involved in binding the heme groups. Combining this result with the previous biochemical studies of this mutant, we hypothesize that the insertion of this highly charged side chain alters the conformation around the b562 heme group such that 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide and the other inhibitors of this group have reduced access to the inhibitor binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1497300077,"We have isolated and sequenced a 2.1-kilobase cDNA encoding 86% of the sequence of alpha-actinin. The cDNA clone was isolated from a chick embryo fibroblast cDNA library constructed in the expression vector lambda gt11. Identification of this sequence as alpha-actinin was confirmed by immunological methods and by comparing the deduced protein sequence with the sequence of several CNBr fragments obtained from adult chicken smooth muscle (gizzard) alpha-actinin. The deduced protein sequence shows two distinct domains, one of which consists of four repeats of approximately 120 amino acids. This region corresponds to a previously identified 50-kDa tryptic peptide involved in formation of the alpha-actinin dimer. The last 19 residues of C-terminal sequence display an homology with the so-called E-F hand of Ca2+-binding proteins. Hybridization analysis reveals only one size of mRNA (approximately 3.5 kilobases) in fibroblasts, but multiple bands in genomic cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W1576099895,"We have analyzed the transfer kinetics of recA protein from one polynucleotide to another by monitoring the change in fluorescence of a modified single-stranded M13 DNA, referred to as etheno M13 DNA, that accompanies recA protein dissociation. The observed rate of transfer is dependent on the concentration of competitor polynucleotide, polythymidylic acid (poly(dT]; increasing the poly(dT) concentration increases the rate of transfer. These data are inconsistent with the rate-limiting step in the transfer mechanism occurring by a simple dissociation process. Under certain conditions, the apparent rate constant displays plateau behavior at high poly(dT) concentrations. This result is indicative of transfer occurring through a ternary intermediate including etheno M13 DNA and poly(dT). The transfer reaction was found to occur through two kinetically distinct species of transferring recA protein X DNA complexes. The relative amounts of these two species was affected by both the MgCl2 and protein concentration, suggesting that the two kinetic components reflect different aggregation states of the recA protein X DNA complex. Because etheno M13 DNA and poly(dT) contain no complementary sequences, we have concluded that recA protein has the intrinsic ability to form a kinetic ternary intermediate with two separate single-stranded DNA molecules in the absence of homology."
https://openalex.org/W1596660581,"Fatty acyltransferase activity that catalyzes the transfer of palmitic acid from palmitoyl-CoA to the endogenous myelin proteolipid protein has been demonstrated in isolated rat brain myelin. Optimum enzyme activity for the acylation of proteolipid protein was obtained in 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol at a pH of 7.5 and at 37 degrees C. Other detergents had little or no effect on the reaction whereas acylation was completely abolished by sodium dodecyl sulphate (0.1%). Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the reaction involves the net addition of fatty acid to the protein and not a rapid fatty acid exchange. The rate of acylation was linear up to 30 min, indicating that the concentration of endogenous protein acceptor was constant. Under these conditions and at short time periods, the enzyme activity versus acyl-CoA concentration showed a hyperbolic curve. The apparent Km and Vmax for palmitoyl-CoA was 41 microM and 115 pmol/mg protein/min. Similar values were obtained for stearoyl and oleoyl-CoA, whereas myristoyl-CoA showed a lower specificity for the enzyme. The acyl-CoA specificity was also studied in competition experiments using several saturated and unsaturated fatty acid-CoAs. The product of the reaction was identified as myelin proteolipid protein and the fatty acid was shown to be attached to the protein via an ester linkage. Limited proteolysis and peptide mapping showed that the same sites on the proteolipid protein were acylated when the reaction was carried out in isolated myelin preparations or in brain tissue slices, suggesting physiological importance for the in vitro acylation of endogenous myelin proteolipid protein."
https://openalex.org/W1605291816,"Microsomal estrogen synthetase (cytochrome P-450ES), also known as aromatase, was purified from fresh human placenta microsomes by DEAE-Trisacryl and testosterone-agarose chromatography. Estrogen synthetase assays were done with androstenedione as substrate, NADPH as electron donor, and a partially purified P-450 reductase from human placenta as the electron carrier. The specific cytochrome P-450 content of the purified P-450 was 0.67 nmol mg-1 of protein, and the preparation contained no cytochrome P-420. The absorbance maximum was 448.5 nm. The specific estrogen synthetase activity of the purified P-450ES fraction was 35 nmol min-1 nmol-1 of cytochrome P-450 or 23.3 nmol min-1 mg-1 of protein. The latter value shows a 179-fold purification with a yield greater than 1% in the two-step procedure. Kinetic constants for the reaction were measured with androstenedione as the aromatizable substrate. The Km was 1.4 nM and the Vmax was 37 nmol min-1 nmol-1 of P-450. The purified enzyme aromatized androstenedione and testosterone at identical rates; androstenedione gave only estrone, and testosterone gave only estradiol-17 beta. Dehydroepiandrosterone was not detectably aromatized or otherwise metabolized. Neither 16 alpha-hydroxytestosterone nor 16 alpha-hydroxyandrostenedione was aromatized. No hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase or reductase was detected in direct assays. No free reaction intermediates were detected in aromatization assay incubation mixtures. The purity of the product and the simplicity of the preparation recommend it for use in further studies of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1549379769,"Using a fibronectin cDNA probe, we have studied the accumulation of fibronectin mRNA in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in response to inflammation. Nonactivated PMN from human peripheral blood were used as a source of noninflammatory cells and PMN from inflamed knee joints of patients with chronic inflammatory joint disorders (rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis) were used as a source of inflammatory cells. By dot blot and Northern hybridization analysis, we have found the presence of fibronectin mRNA in these cells. Its size was estimated at approximately equal to 8.7-8.8 kilobases. When noninflammatory PMN were compared to inflammatory PMN in terms of fibronectin mRNA accumulation, a marked increase was found in inflammatory cells (2- to 12.7-fold stimulation). It was also observed that the increased mRNA levels in inflammatory PMN lead to increased synthesis of the protein. These findings establish that PMN are part of the fibronectin-producing cells and that the level of mRNA in these cells is influenced by the inflammatory process."

The purification resulted in more than 3,000-fold enrichment in [Val5]angiotensin II phosphorylation activity (specific activity 202 nmol/min/mg). All column chromatography profiles showed single protein tyrosine kinase activity peaks with the exception of that of affinity chromatography, where about 50% of the enzyme activity appeared with the breakthrough fraction; only the bound enzyme was further purified. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of a purified sample phosphorylated in the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP revealed the presence of a single phosphorylated polypeptide of molecular weight 50,000 which represents about 40% of total protein. Analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions showed that protein tyrosine kinase activity co-migrated with the phosphoprotein. Stoichiometry of the phosphorylation of the 50-kDa polypeptide was found to be 1.0 mol/mol. The purified sample did not appear to contain phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase activity. Both casein and histone could be phosphorylated by the purified sample, and the phosphorylation occurred only at tyrosine residue, suggesting that there was no protein serine and threonine kinase contamination."
https://openalex.org/W1584159536,"The framework model of protein folding requires the hydrogen-bonded secondary structure to be formed early in folding (i.e. the formation of secondary structure precedes the tertiary structure) (Kim, P. S., and Baldwin, R. L. (1982) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 51, 459-489). To test the framework model directly the kinetics of bovine growth hormone (bGH) folding were compared utilizing two methods of detection, one that measures the secondary structure (far ultraviolet circular dichroism) and another that measures the tertiary structure (near ultraviolet absorbance). The results demonstrate that, under identical folding conditions, the kinetics observed by far ultraviolet circular dichroism are faster than those observed by ultraviolet absorption. The faster kinetics observed by circular dichroism indicate the existence of a helix-containing intermediate which is consistent with the framework model. The effect of protein concentration and denaturant concentration on the kinetics of refolding were studied. The rate of refolding measured by absorbance and circular dichroism was dependent on protein concentration. The protein concentration dependence on refolding is due to the transient formation of an associated intermediate. The concentration dependence of folding is taken as evidence that folding is a sequential process with partially folded monomers responsible for the observed association effect. At dilute protein concentrations the refolding can be studied independent of the association phenomena. The growth hormones utilized in this study were derived from Escherichia coli through recombinant DNA technology and from bovine pituitaries. The pituitary-derived bGH has been shown to be heterogeneous at the NH2 terminus (Lorenson, M. F., and Ellis, S. (1975) Endocrinology 96, 833-838), whereas the recombinant DNA-derived bGH contains a single NH2 terminus. No differences in the folding kinetics between the recombinant DNA and pituitary derived-bGH were observed. It is concluded that the heterogeneity of the NH2 terminus of growth hormone obtained from bovine pituitaries does not affect the observed in vitro folding kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W1492226534,"It has been shown that the access of the alpha-toxin of Staphylococcus aureus to the target membrane and assembly of the hexamer can be monitored independently by respectively measuring the fluorescence energy transfer from the tryptophan residue(s) of the toxin to the dansylated phosphatidylethanolamine in the liposome membrane and the fluorescence increment of the toxin at 336 nm (Ikigai, H., and Nakae, T., (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2150-2155). Measurement of these parameters under various conditions showed the following results: when phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes composed of saturated fatty acids were mixed with the toxin, the fluorescence energy transfer occurred below, at, and above the transition temperature of the lipid, but the change of fluorescence at 336 nm was never detectable; when PC-liposomes containing unsaturated fatty acids were used, both the fluorescence energy transfer and the fluorescence increment of 336 nm were observed. These results suggested that the toxin-membrane interaction occurs in PC-membranes containing saturated and/or unsaturated fatty acids and that the oligomerization occurs only in the presence of PC containing unsaturated fatty acid(s). This conclusion was supported by the results of quantitative determination of the toxin-hexamer assembly and leakage of carboxyfluorescein from PC-liposomes under conditions similar to the above."
https://openalex.org/W182610081,"Previously we examined factors involved in the entry mechanism of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PTx) at the level of lipid-protein interactions (Farahbakhsh, Z. T., Baldwin, R. L., and Wisnieski, B. J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11404-11408). Exposure to a low pH environment appears to be an obligatory trigger of the entry pathway. In this report we describe the effect of pH upon the conformation of PTx. We have found that the intrinsic fluorescence of PTx is strongly dependent on pH, decreasing between pH 7.4 and 4.0 with a red shift in the emission lambda max. The changes are reversible and associated with the acquisition of a binding site for the fluorescent dye 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS). The fluorescence intensity of ANS in the presence of PTx increases with decreasing pH and is accompanied by a blue shift in emission spectra, indicative of exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. These changes are also reversible. Both the intrinsic fluorescence and ANS binding profiles show a dramatic dependence on pH, with the transitions centered on pH 5.0 and 4.5, respectively. Circular dichroism studies reveal a 9% decrease in alpha-helicity between pH 7.7 and 4. The susceptibility of toxin to trypsin cleavage is also a function of pH, increasing with decreasing pH. The pH 7.4 cleavage profile is regained when the acid-treated samples are brought back to pH 7.4. The conformational changes observed in these pH shift experiments are likely to be physiologically significant because the conditions closely resemble those that the toxin would encounter if entry into the cytoplasm of a cell involves escape from an endosomal compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1573782790,"The biosynthesis of the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone III (JH III) was studied using corpora allata of the cockroach Diploptera punctata incubated in vitro and a radiochemical assay for the hormone produced. The influence of several exogenous precursors such as glucose, trehalose, acetate, amino acids, and mevalonate on JH synthetic rates was studied. Glucose or trehalose were needed for an optimal rate of JH synthesis. Highest rates were achieved at trehalose concentrations below the normal hemolymph levels (35-40 mM). About one-third of the glucose utilized for the biosynthesis of JH III was metabolized through a pentose pathway, but acetyl-CoA derived from glucose was significantly diluted by acetyl-CoA from other sources. Amino acids provided both a source of carbon for JH III synthesis and a source of energy that allowed JH III synthesis from acetate and stimulated JH III synthesis from glucose. Acetate was a poor substrate, because it could not support JH III synthesis in long term incubations. The incorporation of exogenous mevalonate into JH III was dependent on the physiological state of the glands, but there was a significant dilution with endogenous mevalonate. This dilution reflected in part the poor penetration of mevalonate into the corpora allata cells, because JH synthesis in mevinolin-treated cells was not fully rescued by mevalonate."
https://openalex.org/W1624350315,"The principal mechanism of cellular uptake of benzo(a)pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) from lipoproteins into cells is spontaneous transfer through the aqueous phase (Plant, A. L., Benson, D.M., and Smith, L.C. (1985) J. Cell Biol. 100, 1295-1308). Cellular uptake of benzo(a)pyrene from low density lipoproteins followed first-order kinetics with a rate constant that was independent of the relative lipoprotein concentrations or cell number but which was 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the rate constant for benzo(a)pyrene desorption from low density lipoproteins. Moreover, identical rate constants for cellular uptake of benzo(a)pyrene were observed when the donor vehicle was high density lipoproteins, very low density lipoproteins, or single bilayer phosphatidylcholine vesicles, even though rate constants for benzo(a)pyrene transfer from these donor vehicles differed by 10-fold. When phosphatidylcholine vesicles containing benzo(a)pyrene and a nontransferable fluorescence quencher were mixed with cells in a stopped-flow system, two kinetic components were distinguished: a fast component with a rate constant corresponding to that measured for transfer of benzo(a)pyrene out of vesicles, followed by a much slower component, with a time course approximating that measured for cellular accumulation of benzo(a)pyrene by other techniques. Rate constants for desorption of a series of PAH which contained different number of aromatic rings from phosphatidylcholine vesicles differed over a 70-fold range. First-order rate constants for cell uptake of benzo(a)pyrene and five other PAH of different molecular sizes had the same 70-fold range of values, but were 2 orders of magnitude smaller than their respective rate constants for desorption from single bilayer vesicles. In addition, activation energies for cell uptake were essentially identical to the respective activation energies for desorption of PAH from phosphatidylcholine vesicles, confirming the mechanistic similarity of the two processes."
https://openalex.org/W1549453307,"Platelet thrombospondin interacts with fibrinogen in a specific and saturable manner. Thrombospondin was found to specifically bind to the A alpha- and B beta-chains of fibrinogen; binding was independent of divalent ions. Binding could be blocked either by preincubation of thrombospondin with 9.4 microM fibrinogen or by preincubation of fibrinogen with 1.1 nM thrombospondin. Thrombospondin bound only to the beta-chain component of the D and DD plasmin fragment of fibrinogen. Thrombospondin interaction with fibrinogen was not blocked by preincubation with synthetic peptides which have previously been identified as either the fibrinogen receptor (alpha 572-575, the synthetic tetrapeptide arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine) or cell attachment (gamma 400-411) domains. Fibrinogen, therefore, possesses at least two unique and distinct sites, within the A alpha- and B beta-chains, for its interaction with thrombospondin."
https://openalex.org/W1485601917,"Two-affinity purified tetanotoxin forms, TeToA and TeToB, with different affinities for gangliosides were characterized by analytical ultracentrifuge, circular dichroism (CD), and amino acid composition. Both toxin forms share a common sedimentation coefficient of about 6-7 S and similar alpha-helicity values, but they vary in amino acid composition. Incubation of TeToB with micellar polysialogangliosides results in formation of high (21-24 S) and medium (13-15 S) size toxin-micellar ganglioside aggregates as revealed by analytical ultracentrifuge technique. At TeToB/[N-acetylneuraminyl]-galactosyl-N-acetylgalactosaminyl- [N-acetylneuraminyl-N-acetylneuraminyl]-galactosylglucosylceramide (GT1b) molar ratios of greater than 26, high molecular weight aggregates (Mr greater than or equal to 700,000) which contain between 3 and 5 toxin monomers are formed, whereas at molar ratios less than 15, about 1-2 monomers are present. TeToA does not form aggregates in the presence of gangliosides. A marked increase in the alpha-helix from about 20 to 39% is apparent in the CD spectrum of TeToB after interaction with ganglioside mixture (G1b). Cerebrosides, sulfatides, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylserine also increase the alpha-helix, presumably because of an overall effect of lipids on the protein. TeToA and fragment B but not C also undergo similar changes in the presence of G1b, suggesting that the effect of ganglioside is not specific. The polarity of the CD spectra of a number of gangliosides is shifted from a negative to a positive value after interaction with tetanotoxin. The data are consistent with the interpretation of a discrete hydrophobic domain on the toxin heavy chain which interacts with micellar gangliosides to form macromolecular complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1557343352,"Flow microcalorimetric titrations of calmodulin with melittin at 25 degrees C revealed that the formation of the high-affinity one-to-one complex in the presence of Ca2+ (Comte, M., Maulet, Y., and Cox, J. A. (1983) Biochem, J. 209, 269-272) is entirely entropy driven (delta H0 = 30.3 kJ X mol-1; delta S0 = 275 J X K-1 X mol-1). Neither the proton nor the Mg2+ concentrations have any significant effect on the strength of the complex. In the absence of Ca2+, a nonspecific calmodulin-(melittin)n complex is formed; the latter is predominantly entropy driven, accompanied by a significant uptake of protons and fully antagonized by Mg2+. Enthalpy titrations of metal-free calmodulin with Ca2+ in the presence of an equimolar amount of melittin were carried out at pH 7.0 in two buffers of different protonation enthalpy. The enthalpy and proton release profiles indicate that: protons, absorbed by the nonspecific calmodulin-melittin complex, are released upon binding of the first Ca2+; Ca2+ binding to the high-affinity configuration of the calmodulin-melittin complex displays an affinity constant greater than or equal to 10(7) M-1, i.e. 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of free calmodulin; the latter is even more entropy driven (delta H0 = 7.2 kJ X site-1; delta S0 = 158 J X K-1 X site-1) than binding to free calmodulin (delta H0 = 4.7 kJ X site-1; delta S0 = 112 J X K-1 X site-1), thus underlining the importance of hydrophobic forces in the free energy coupling involved in the ternary complex."
https://openalex.org/W1488220163,"A variety of studies have shown that about 20 proteins can be isolated from bovine adrenal medullary cytosol by virtue of their ability to bind to chromaffin granule membranes in the presence of Ca2+. In the present study we have examined the properties of a group of seven of these proteins. This group of proteins binds to granule membranes in the presence of Ca2+, however, the proteins are not released from the membrane by the removal of Ca2+ unless ATP is present. The proteins range from 53 to 59 kDa and they form a multisubunit complex of about 800 kDa. This complex, which we have named chromobindin A, has 13 subunits joined together in a ring, 175 A in diameter and 115 A in height. The binding of chromobindin A to membranes is stimulated by Ca2+, Sr2+, and Ba2+. The release is stimulated by a variety of nucleotides, including the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate. At present the function of chromobindin A in vivo is not clear, although the observation that Ca2+ stimulates chromobindin A binding together with observations that imply that chromobindin A binds to a protease-sensitive receptor on the granule membrane suggest that the complex is involved in exocytosis and that it may be partially responsible for the ATP dependence of this process."

In the presence of vesicles composed of 75% phosphatidylcholine and 25% phosphatidylserine, both Factor V and Va were found to be labeled by the probe. The label was almost exclusively localized to the carboxyl-terminal-derived component E of Factor Va. The results are consistent with the interpretation that component E is the membrane binding subunit of Factor Va and that the interaction between Factor V or Factor Va and the membrane involves the penetration of the protein into the lipid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1611261044,"When the liposome membrane is exposed to the alpha-toxin of Staphylococcus aureus, fluorescence of the tryptophan residue(s) of the toxin molecule increases concomitantly with the degree of toxin-hexamer formation (Ikigai, H., and Nakae, T. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 130, 175-181). In the present study, the toxin-membrane interaction was distinguished from the hexamer formation by the fluorescence energy transfer from the tryptophan residue(s) of the toxin molecule to the dansylated phosphatidylethanolamine in phosphatidylcholine liposome. Measurement of these two parameters yielded the following results. The effect of the toxin concentration and phospholipid concentration on these two parameters showed first order kinetics. The effect of liposome size on the energy transfer and the fluorescence increment of the tryptophan residue(s) was only detectable in small liposomes. Under moderately acidic or basic conditions, the fluorescence energy transfer always preceded the fluorescence increment of the tryptophan residue(s). The fluorescence increment at 336 nm at temperatures below 20 degrees C showed a latent period, whereas the fluorescence energy transfer did not. These results were thought to indicate that when alpha-toxin damages the target membrane, the molecule interacts with the membrane first, and then undergoes oligomerization within the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W191467593,"Two types of rat kininogen mRNAs exhibit marked differences in the regulation of their expressions. The two T kininogen (T) mRNAs considerably increase under acute inflammation conditions, although no such increase occurs in the high molecular weight and low molecular weight K kininogen (K) mRNAs encoded by the same gene. This investigation examines the sequences of the 5' portions of the K and the two T genes and analyzes transcription initiation sites and their utilization at differently regulated conditions of the K and T genes. The sequence analysis indicates that the K and the two T genes are extremely homologous at the 5' portions as well as the 5'-flanking regions of at least 1.0 kilobase pairs. The S1 nuclease and primer extension analyses show that both T and K mRNAs start with three sets of the homologous initiation sites, and the utilization of the two 3'-side initiation sites of the T genes markedly increases under inflammation conditions. In contrast, no such elevation is observed for the three initiation sites of the K gene. Thus, although the sequences involved as transcription initiation sites are extremely homologous, their utilizations in the expressions of the K and T genes are regulated differently under inflammation conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2117914715,"The transfer of recA protein from a fluorescently modified single-stranded DNA, containing 1,N6-ethenoadenosine and 3,N4-ethenocytosine, to polydeoxythymidylic acid (poly(dT)) was shown to occur by a complex mechanism in both the absence and presence of ADP (Menetski, J. P., and Kowalczykowski, S. C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2085-2092). A part of the mechanism involves the formation of a kinetic ternary intermediate. Since the binding and hydrolysis of ATP by recA protein is involved in many of the recA protein in vitro activities, we have analyzed the effect of ATP on the transfer reaction. In the presence of ATP, the transfer reaction is dependent on the concentration of the competitor single-stranded DNA, poly(dT). This result suggests that transfer does not occur by a simple dissociation mechanism. The reaction occurs via two kinetically distinct species of protein X DNA complexes with properties that are similar to those characterized for the transfer reaction in the absence of ATP. There is a complicated effect of nucleotide concentration on the rate of transfer. At low concentrations of ATP (less than 50 microM), increasing nucleotide concentration increases the rate of transfer; this is similar to the effect of ADP. However, at high concentrations of ATP (greater than 50 microM), increasing ATP concentration decreases the rate of transfer. Finally, the processivity of ATP hydrolysis during transfer was found to increase with increases in ATP concentration. Less than one ATP molecule was hydrolyzed per transfer event at low ATP concentrations (less than 20 microM) while greater than 50 molecules were hydrolyzed at high ATP concentration (greater than 250 microM). These data suggest that the rate of transfer is not directly coupled to the rate of hydrolysis."

Whenever the 8-bromoadenosine residue was substituted for adenosine in the first or 5'-terminal residue, there resulted a marked decrease in ability to bind to the 2-5A-dependent endonuclease. A similar result was obtained when the second adenosine nucleotide was replaced by 8-bromoadenosine. To the contrary, all analogs that bore an 8-bromoadenosine (br8A) in the third or 2'-terminal position were bound about as well as parent 2-5A to RNase L. Additionally, the 5'-diphosphate pp5'A2'p5'A2'p5' (br8A) was 10 times more effective than 2-5A as an inhibitor of translation. An increase in stability could not explain this significantly enhanced ability since the 2'-terminally brominated analog showed a similar half-life to 2-5A itself. Finally of particular interest was the analog monophosphate p5'A2'p5'(br8A)2'p5'(br8A) which possessed nearly 10% of the translational inhibitory activity of 2-5A triphosphate itself. These results suggest that changes in the base-sugar torsion angles of 2-5A may modulate both binding to and activation of mouse L cell RNase L."

Hybrid-selected translation using plasmid DNA from positive clones yielded a 34-kDa protein which was immunoprecipitated by affinity-purified anti-SBP antibodies. SBP mRNA is about 1260 bases long as measured by Northern blot hybridization. An amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was identical to an amino acid sequence found in SBP. SBP is extremely rich in acidic residues. Aspartic and glutamic acids, which make up about 33% of the total sequence, comprise 89 of a stretch of 126 amino acids at the carboxyl-terminal end. By dot hybridization analysis, SBP mRNA was not detected in rat liver, kidney, brain, submaxillary gland, or uterus. The prostate levels of SBP mRNA were measured by mRNA translation and dot hybridization. SBP mRNA level decreased to less than 20% of normal 2 days after castration of rats, and this decrease was reversed by 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone injection into castrated rats."

https://openalex.org/W1729286460,"Preliminary studies of vitamin B6 metabolism in three adult domestic cats detected very little pyridoxic acid in the urine. At oral doses of 49 to 490 mumol of [14C]pyridoxine hydrochloride, 50% of the excreted dose occurred as pyridoxine 3-sulfate and 25% as N-methylpyridoxine. The identity of these two metabolites was confirmed by isolation from urine and comparison with known compounds. A third compound was identified as pyridoxal 3-sulfate on the basis of chromatographic behavior and fluorescent properties before and after hydrolysis. At pyridoxine intakes of 0.97 mumol/day, the concentration of pyridoxal 3-sulfate in the urine sometimes exceeded the concentration of pyridoxine 3-sulfate. Pyridoxic acid remained a minor urinary metabolite at pyridoxine intakes ranging from 0.97 to 490 mumol/day. Although sulfation of phenol groups and methylation of the ring nitrogen are well-known detoxication reactions, this appears to be the first time such reactions have been observed in normal metabolism of vitamin B6. These observations provide further evidence of the diversity of vitamin B6 metabolism between species. While such diversity complicates the extrapolation of data from animal studies to humans, it does provide a variety of models for examining the influences of various factors on vitamin B6 metabolism."

Removal of the protecting groups results in the formation of 2-(p-azidosalicylamido)-1,3'-dithiopropionate (ASD)-insulin with insulin receptor binding activity equivalent to unmodified insulin. Iodination of ASD-insulin results in the incorporation of 125I into both the azidohydroxybenzoyl moiety of SASD and a tyrosine residue of insulin. Following binding of 125I-ASD-insulin to intact monolayers of 3T3-C2 cells, radiolabel is incorporated exclusively into a 135-kDa protein in a manner dependent upon the length of exposure of the cells to short wavelength ultraviolet light. This protein corresponds in molecular weight to the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor. Labeling of this protein can be inhibited by excess unlabeled insulin. Reduction of the disulfide bond of ASD with 10 mM glutathione causes the release of the 125I-insulin portion of the reagent from the receptor complex, with the iodinated photoactivated end of ASD covalently attached to the receptor. Insulin receptor labeled in this manner retains its ability to bind insulin. General metabolic processes of the intact cells do not appear to be perturbed by this labeling procedure, and the cellular processing of the insulin receptor does not appear to be modified by the covalent labeling of the receptor protein. This procedure therefore provides a way to specifically label the cell surface insulin receptor in a manner which does not perturb the normal functioning of the labeled cell and equally importantly, does not perturb the normal cellular processing of the insulin receptor itself."
https://openalex.org/W1495808634,"We have identified and partially purified a growth inhibitor protein secreted by human diploid fibroblast cells. This protein is not secreted constitutively but only after induction with the double stranded hetero duplex polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid. The growth inhibitory activity has been purified 3,800-fold and has an estimated molecular mass of 12,000 daltons. The protein will inhibit the growth in culture of human diploid fibroblast cells, human cells derived from tumors, and mouse L cells. Although interferon-beta is secreted with the growth inhibitory protein, the partially purified growth inhibitory protein has no antiviral activity, and its activity is not neutralized by antibodies to interferon-alpha, interferon-beta, and interferon-gamma. We believe this growth inhibitory activity to reside in a newly defined protein and have named it fibroblast-derived growth inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W1587358845,"We have previously demonstrated that during embryonic development of the chick heart between days 2 1/2 and 10 days in ovo, muscarinic cholinergic inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity increased 4-fold, and the sensitivity of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity to inhibition by carbamylcholine increased 26-fold. Although the number of muscarinic receptors remained constant between days 2 1/2 and 10 in ovo, the levels of a 39- and 41-kDa pertussis toxin substrate increased in parallel with the ability of muscarinic agonist to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity (Liang. B.T., Hellmich, M. R., Neer, E. J., and Galper, J. B. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9011-9021). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that between days 2 1/2 and 10 in ovo muscarinic receptors were uncoupled from inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity because of limiting levels of pertussis toxin substrates. In the current studies, in order to test this hypothesis homogenates of embryonic chick hearts 3 1/2 days in ovo were reconstituted with membranes from hearts of hatched chicks. In order to rule out reconstitution by factors from hatched chick hearts other than pertussis toxin substrates, muscarinic receptors from hatched chick hearts were inactivated by covalent binding of benzilycholine mustard and adenylate cyclase inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide prior to reconstitution. Reconstitution of benzilylcholine mustard/N-ethylmaleimide treated hatched chick heart membranes with homogenates of embryonic chick hearts 3 1/2 days in ovo resulted in a 2 1/2-fold increase in the ability of carbamylcholine to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity and reconstitution of hatched chick heart membranes with homogenates of hearts 2 1/2 days in ovo resulted in an approximately 10-fold increase in the sensitivity of isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity to inhibition by carbamylcholine. Membranes from hearts of hatched chicks which had been injected with pertussis toxin were incapable of reconstituting muscarinic inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in homogenates of hearts 3 1/2 days in ovo. These data support the conclusion that early in embryonic development coupling of muscarinic receptors to inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity is limited by the availability of a pertussis toxin substrate."
