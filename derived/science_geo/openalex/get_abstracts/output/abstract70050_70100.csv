https://openalex.org/W1677961490,An alcohol dehydrogenase has been purified from two strains of Drosophila melanogaster. This enzyme has a molecular weight of 4.4 × 104 and shows a broad specificity for secondary alcohols. Crude extracts of flies contain multiple forms of the enzyme. One of these forms has been isolated by ion exchange chromatography.
https://openalex.org/W1529819945,"Abstract The subcellular distribution in rat liver and rat kidney of the enzymes hydrolyzing triglycerides at acid pH has been studied. The lipase was shown to be lysosomal by the purification of lysosomes and by the isolation of Triton WR 1339-filled liver lysosomes. The lipase was found to be bound to the lysosomal membranes, had a pH optimum of 4.2, and required Triton X-100 in the reaction mixture for maximum activity. The lysosomal lipase had maximum activity against glycerol tridecanoate but had considerable activity against other long chain triglycerides. The lipase was inhibited by NaCl, NaF, iodoacetate, and Hg++ ions and was not affected by Ca++, Mg++, ethylenediamine tetraacetate, protamine sulfate, and sodium taurocholate. This is the first clear demonstration of a lipase in lysosomes. It is suggested that the lipase is involved in the intralysosomal digestion of triglycerides entering lysosomes by autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W1556841111,"Abstract A procedure is described for the partial resolution of enzymes in the rat brain that hydrolyze aminoacylated naphthylamines and aminopeptidase substrates. These enzymes were partially purified by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, gel filtration, and diethylaminoethyl cellulose resolution. Three distinct peaks were resolved on DEAE-cellulose. The first peak showed marked specificity for the tripeptide Leu-Gly-Gly; the second was specific for arginyl- and lysyl-β-naphthylamides; the third was active with both basic and neutral amino acid naphthylamides. Study of the arylamidases showed that their properties are distinct from those of the exo- and endopeptidases. Purified arylamidases were shown to be dependent on metal ions for activity. Treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetate resulted in loss of activity, which could be restored by the addition of Zn2+, Co2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, or La3+. The values of Km and the optimal pH varied with the different arylamide analogues. For leucyl-β-naphthyl-amide the value of Km was 8 x 10-4 m at the optimal pH of 6.5; for arginyl- and lysyl-β-naphthylamides, the values were 5 x 10-4 m at pH 6.5 and 1.3 x 10-4 m at pH 8.0, respectively. Arylamidases required dithiothreitol for stability; activity was increased by cysteine and β-mercaptoethanol, and inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. The properties of the brain arylamidases were distinct from those of brain aminotripeptidase and hog kidney leucine aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.1.1). Unlike the arylamidases, the other enzymes were not affected by puromycin."
https://openalex.org/W1490468591,"Abstract A nonspecific cellobiose phosphorylase from Clostridium thermocellum, which has been purified over 100-fold, is active on 10 different glucosyl acceptors, d-glucose, 2-deoxyglucose, 6-deoxyglucose, d-glucosamine, d-mannose, d-altrose, l-galactose, l-fucose, d-arabinose, and d-xylose. Following electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels, the activity with various acceptors occurs at the location of the major protein component, indicating that a single enzyme catalyzes these reactions. The pH optimum is about 6.5 with d-xylose as an acceptor. The relative Vmax and apparent Km values are 202 and 9.2 mm for 6-deoxyglucose, 100 and 35 mm for d-xylose, 53 and 73 mm for 2-deoxyglucose, 31 and 9.5 mm for d-glucosamine, 22 and 85 mm for d-mannose, 9 and 240 mm for d-arabinose and 8 and 160 mm for l-fucose. The Ki for d-glucose is 1.2 mm. The apparent Km value is 7.3 mm for cellobiose and 2.9 mm for Pi."
https://openalex.org/W1482860679,"Abstract An uncross-linked monomer (nascent peptidoglycan unit) accumulates in cells of Staphylococcus aureus treated with low concentrations of penicillin G or with ampicillin, methicillin, or cephalothin. The uncross-linked monomer has been isolated, and analyses indicate that it represents a prefabricated subunit of the wall bearing both of the d-alanine residues of its pentapeptide precursor as well as an open pentaglycine chain. Pulse labeling experiments indicate that this uncross-linked unit is a direct precursor of the cross-linked peptidoglycan and that its cross-linking is inhibited by penicillin G. At high concentrations of penicillin G, wall synthesis ceases abruptly and no accumulation of the nascent peptidoglycan units is observed. These data have been obtained in support of the hypothesis that penicillins are substrate analogues of the d-alanyl-d-alanine end of the nascent peptidoglycan units and that they acylate the transpeptidase which catalyzes the cross-linking reaction. The data may also provide an explanation of the paradoxical observation that the killing rate in S. aureus by penicillin G is higher at low concentrations than at high concentrations of the antibiotic. In the presence of low concentrations a weakened wall may be formed, thus rendering the organisms more susceptible to lysis than at high concentrations of penicillin where wall synthesis abruptly ceases."
https://openalex.org/W1538806881,"SUMMARY The administration of phenobarbital to rats causes an increase in hepatic microsomal phospholipid. After a tracer dose of 3*P04 the specific activities of hepatic phospholipid phosphorus and inorganic phosphate were higher in treated male rats than in controls. No increases were seen in either pool in treated females. These data suggest that phenobarbital enhances synthesis of microsomal phospholipid in male rats but not in females. In addition, phenobarbital reduces the catabolism of microsomal phospholipid in both male and female rats."

The inhibitory activity of an organophosphate such as paraoxon in vivo and in vitro is significantly stronger than that of an organothiophosphate such as parathion. The injury to rice plants by insecticides sprayed on them with propanil seems to be caused by the inhibition of the propanil detoxifying enzyme."

The isolated enzyme, after 1500- to 1600-fold purification, has a specific activity of approximately 800 µmoles of substrate converted per min per mg at 30°. It was found to be homogeneous by the criteria of sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and zone electrophoresis on cellulose acetate. Concomitant with the homogeneity measurements, the following physical parameters were established: s20, w (c = 5 mg per ml), 3.86 S; D20, w (boundary spreading during velocity sedimentation, c = 5 mg per ml), 7.78 × 10−7 cm2 sec−1; D20, w (gel filtration), 7.62 × 10−7 cm2 sec−1; molecular weight, either by velocity sedimentation and diffusion or by equilibrium sedimentation, 45,000 ± 1000."
https://openalex.org/W1488615143,"Abstract Inhibition of human purine nucleoside phosphorylase was studied by measuring the conversion of 14C-hypoxanthine to 14C-inosine, both by intact erythrocytes (in vitro) and by a partially purified enzyme preparation from these cells. In contrast to previous investigations, no exogenous nucleoside ribosyl donor was used with the intact cells. With the isolated enzyme, ribose 1-phosphate was used as the ribosyl donor. The inhibition constants of purines and purine analogues obtained from studies with intact cells agreed well with those from the purified enzyme. Hypoxanthine, xanthine, and guanine were bound well to the isolated enzyme (Ki values of 1 to 4 x 10-5 m). Methylation of these compounds at any one of the ring nitrogens or at the oxygen on position 6 markedly decreased this binding. The Ki values for 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine were of the order of 10-4 m. In contrast to the oxypurines, methylation of these thiopurines did not markedly reduce their binding to the enzyme. Adenine, 2,6-diaminopurine, allopurinol, oxoallopurinol, and 6-thioxanthine were poorly bound to the enzyme. With intact erythrocytes, inhibition by 6-methylthiopurine ribonucleoside was observed only when an exogenous nucleoside ribosyl donor was used. With the isolated enzyme, 6-methylthiopurine ribonucleoside was a very poor inhibitor of both the synthetic and phosphorolytic reactions. These results support the hypothesis that nucleoside transport is inhibited by the ribonucleoside of 6-methylthiopurine."
https://openalex.org/W2123598700,"Abstract Type L pyruvate kinase from mouse liver has been studied. The enzyme is strongly inhibited by low concentrations of copper ions, and the inhibition is reversed by fructose 1,6-diphosphate. In the absence of inhibitor, fructose 1,6-diphosphate also increases the pyruvate kinase activity at pH values higher than 7. Furthermore, the Cu++ inhibition is pH and K+ concentration dependent. Plots of reaction rates against phosphoenolpyruvate concentration give a sigmoid curve whereas a hyperbolic curve is obtained for the other substrate (adenosine diphosphate). When fructose 1,6-diphosphate is added, the response to phosphoenolpyruvate concentration is transformed to give a Michaelian curve and the affinity of the enzyme for this substrate increases. In the presence of Cu++, the Km for adenosine diphosphate is not substantially modified, but the Vmax decreases markedly. On the other hand, the apparent Km for phosphoenolpyruvate is considerably increased by this cation. The enzyme has a full requirement for Mg++ and a monovalent cation (K+ or NH4+). The activation of the enzyme with NH4+ has been found to be more efficient than with K+. The physiological role of the Cu++-fructose 1,6-diphosphate interrelation in the balance between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1503054422,"Abstract Phosphate dependence obeying Michaelis-Menten type kinetics was found to be a common feature of pentosyl transfer catalyzed by guinea pig uridine phosphorylase and rabbit thymidine phosphorylase. Despite this basic similarity, significant differences in the characteristics of this phosphate dependence were observed. Stoichiometric amounts of phosphate (Km' = 3 x 10-4 m) were required for optimal rates of pentosyl transfer catalyzed by uridine phosphorylase, while less than stoichiometric amounts (Km' = 3 x 10-5 m) were required with thymidine phosphorylase. Sephadex G-100 chromatography essentially eliminated the pentosyl transfer activity of the uridine phosphorylase preparation in the absence of added phosphate. However, after the same treatment, thymidine phosphorylase retained a significant amount of transfer activity in the absence of added phosphate. Relatively high concentrations of phosphate inhibited pentosyl transfer catalyzed by uridine phosphorylase, but did not inhibit the transfer activity of thymidine phosphorylase. These results suggest an ordered mechanism for uridine phosphorylase, similar to that of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, involving the initial addition of pyrimidine or nucleoside to the free enzyme. Pentosyl transfer by this mechanism involves a free pentose 1-phosphate intermediate. For thymidine phosphorylase, the available data suggest an ordered mechanism involving the reverse sequence of addition, i.e. the initial addition of phosphate or pentose 1-phosphate to the free enzyme. Pentosyl transfer by this mechanism involves a pentose 1-phosphate intermediate which is bound to the enzyme rather than being free. At relatively higher concentrations, arsenate substituted for the phosphate requirement of pentosyl transfer reactions catalyzed by uridine phosphorylase. The apparent Km value for arsenate was 3.6 x 10-4 m as compared with a value of 3 x 10-5 m for phosphate. Arsenate also substituted for phosphate in pentosyl transfer reactions catalyzed by thymidine phosphorylase. These findings suggest that the pentose 1-arsenate esters are sufficiently stable to act as intermediates in pentosyl transfer catalyzed by the pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylases."

https://openalex.org/W1572375307,"Abstract A particulate enzyme from Clostridium welchii catalyzes the synthesis of alanyl phosphatidylglycerol from alanyl-transfer RNA and phosphatidylglycerol. In order to investigate the specificity of alanyl phosphatidylglycerol synthetase toward alanyl-tRNA, a variety of derivatives of alanyl-tRNA have been prepared. N-Acetylalanyl-tRNA and lactyl-tRNA were found to be unsuitable substrates for alanyl phosphatidylglycerol synthesis. Inasmuch as control experiments indicated that the inactivity of these potential substrates could not be ascribed to modifications of the polyribonucleotide chain of the tRNA during the preparation of these derivatives, it was concluded that the synthetase has a recognition site for the aminoacyl group of alanyl-tRNA. In order to determine whether the enzyme also manifests specificity toward the polyribonucleotide chain, alanyl-tRNAcys was prepared and tested as a substrate for alanyl phosphatidylglycerol synthetase. The finding that this compound was inactive as substrate in aminoacyl lipid synthesis, despite the fact that it was active in a poly UG-dependent polypeptide-synthesizing system, indicated that alanyl phosphatidylglycerol synthetase also has a recognition site for at least a portion of the polyribonucleotide chain of alanyl-tRNA. Further support for this conclusion was obtained by experiments with a large molecular weight fragment of alanyl-tRNA produced by limited digestion with T1 RNase. The fragment was found to be inactive as a substrate in alanyl phosphatidylglycerol synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1497269695,"The addition of epinephrine to free brown fat cells obtained by collagenase digestion of rat dorsal interscapular brown adipose tissue concurrently stimulated fatty acid release and respiration after a lag period of about 20 sec. All the effects of epinephrine were mimicked by dibutyryl-3′,5′-AMP. m-Chloro(carbonyl cyanide)phenylhydrazone, a potent uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, stimulated respiration within 5 sec after its addition to fat cells. Epinephrine, theophylline, and dibutyryl-3′,5′-AMP also accelerated respiration in brown fat cells, and addition of m-chloro(carbonyl cyanide)phenylhydrazone with these lipolytic agents did not affect their action on lipolysis or respiration. However, if m-chloro(carbonyl cyanide)phenylhydrazone was added prior to the lipolytic agents, it blocked the stimulation of lipolysis and respiration by theophylline, catecholamine, or dibutyryl-3′,5′-AMP. The lipolytic action of these agents was also inhibited by cyanide. The addition of free fatty acid to the medium did not mimic the stimulation of respiration by catecholamines, despite the fact that at high concentrations of fatty acid the lipolytic action of epinephrine was abolished. All of these results suggest that respiration is coupled to phosphorylation under basal conditions in brown fat cells but that epinephrine stimulates the formation of cyclic AMP which mediates either a direct uncoupling action or an indirect one through stimulation of free fatty acid release."

https://openalex.org/W1499121860,"Abstract The oxidation-reduction equilibrium of human hemoglobin bound to haptoglobin has been investigated. The genetic type of haptoglobin (whether 1-1 or 2-2) has no effect on the oxidation-reduction properties of bound hemoglobin. The shape of the equilibrium curve changes with the molar ratio between haptoglobin and hemoglobin, being clearly asymmetrical when Hp:Hb = 1:1 and symmetrical when Hp:Hb = 2:1. The average value of n near 50% oxidation is less than 1 in either case. When Hp:Hb = 2:1, the oxidation-reduction equilibrium curve can be accounted for quantitatively on the hypothesis that there are two oxidation-reduction systems present in equimolar amounts, and each is characterized by n = 1 but different midpoint potentials (E1 and E2). The interpretation of these results is that when hemoglobin is bound to haptoglobin the stabilizing heme-heme interactions are suppressed with the result that the hemes of each type of chain (α and β) display their intrinsic oxidation-reduction properties. The proposition that the oxidation-reduction potentials of α and β chains are different (by 56 mv at pH 7) is in good agreement with independent experimental results on human hemoglobin and the isolated hemoglobin chains. The oxidation-reduction results taken alone indicate that when Hp:Hb = 2:1 only one type of complex is present. On the other hand, when Hp:Hb = 1:1 the equilibrium data suggest that more than one type of complex is formed, and that the two hemoglobin chains of either type (α or β) are not bound in the same way to the haptoglobin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1533615473,"Abstract The chain elongations of α- and γ-linolenic acids with malonyl coenzyme A with rat liver microsomes were studied. γ-Linolenic acid was converted to eicosatrienoic acid in about 70% yield, whereas α-linolenic acid was only converted to about 30% under the same conditions. Unsaturated acids of the linoleic acid family present in the incubation mixture increased the conversion of both linolenic acids. The conversion of γ-linolenic acid was inhibited most effectively by trienoic acids: 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic, 5,8,11- octadecatrienoic, and 5,8,11-heptadecatrienoic acids. α- Linolenic acid was mainly inhibited by its own metabolic products, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, when these were added. Saturated fatty acids inhibited the conversion of both acids, but in quite different fashions. The inhibition of α-linolenic acid was independent of the chain length of the saturated acids, whereas γ-linolenic acid was most effectively inhibited by tetradecanoic and pentadecanoic acids. The strong inhibition by the saturated fatty acids of the elongation of unsaturated fatty acids may serve as a regulation of the composition of tissue lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1558880245,"Abstract Stoichiometric titrations of human hemoglobin with carbon monoxide show that the interaction of hemoglobin with ligand is accompanied by proportional changes in both the Soret and visible absorption bands. This linearity has been observed in neutral solutions, both in the presence and absence of 2 m NaCl, and in alkaline solutions at pH 9.2. It is concluded that the liganded intermediates taking part in the equilibrium do not differ significantly in spectra from the equivalent hypothetical mixtures of reduced and fully liganded hemoglobin. The CO equilibrium determined in dilute hemoglobin solutions (4.5 x 10- m to 2.34 x 10-7 m) is characterized by a relatively high Hill constant (2.3) and a free ligand concentration of 4.3 to 5.6 x 10-8 m at 50% saturation. The results are of special interest in light of the sedimentation studies and kinetic experiments which indicate that a strongly ligand-linked equilibrium between dimeric and monomeric (or single chain) hemoglobin predominates in this concentration range."

https://openalex.org/W11986092,"Rat epididymal fat pads were incubated in vitro at 37° in bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, with uniformly labeled pyruvate-14C. The net gas exchange, total CO2 production, O2 consumption, pyruvate utilization, lactate and glycerol production, and radioactive carbon incorporation into CO2, fatty acids, and glyceride glycerol were measured. The results were used to estimate the quantitative flow of pyruvate into its major pathways of metabolism in adipose tissue. An exchange reaction between the CO2 phase of the medium and pyruvate occurs, which results in 14CO2 production from pyruvate-14C over and above that produced as a result of oxidation of the pyruvate. The extent of this exchange reaction was measured by incubation of tissue with unlabeled pyruvate and NaH14CO3. Radioactivity appeared in the medium in a product, presumably pyruvate, which was precipitated quantitatively as the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone derivative. Radioactivity was also found in glyceride glycerol, but not in fatty acids. Radioactive fatty acid formation was also measured from mixtures of pyruvate-14C with unlabeled acetate or lactate, and from unlabeled pyruvate and acetate-1,2-14C or lactate-2,314C. The results permit a calculation to be made of the total reduced coenzymes produced and utilized during the metabolism of pyruvate. Up to 30% of the reduced coenzymes formed by the oxidation of pyruvate may be utilized in reduction reactions that are generally accepted to occur in the extramitochondrial space of the cell. If it is assumed that production of reduced coenzymes from pyruvate occurs entirely within the mitochondria, then there arises the question of the form in which reducing equivalents are transported across the mitochondrial membrane. This question is discussed in relation to enzymatic reactions known to occur in adipose tissue and to the increased oxygen consumption that accompanies the conversion of pyruvate to fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1552202239,"Abstract 1. The roles of ubiquinone-10 and of rhodoquinone in photosynthetic ATP formation were studied with chromatophores from a blue-green mutant (G-9) of Rhodospirillum rubrum. 2. Chromatophores contained ubiquinone-10 and rhodoquinone in amounts equal approximately to 50% and 10%, respectively, on a molar basis, of that of bacteriochlorophyll. Other quinones were not present in appreciable amounts. 3. Extraction with isooctane of lyophilized chromatophores greatly lowered the activity of photosynthetic ATP formation measured in the presence of either 6.7 x 10-2 m ascorbate (ascorbate-induced) or 4.0 x 10-4 m phenazine methosulfate (PMS-induced). Both phosphorylation activities were reactivated by the addition of either ubiquinone-6 or ubiquinone-10 or the isooctane extract, but not by addition of either phylloquinone or menadione. The addition of appropriate concentrations of rhodoquinone reactivated the PMS-induced, but not the ascorbate-induced, photosynthetic ATP formation. 4. Photosynthetic ATP formation by lyophilized chromatophores and by extracted chromatophores reactivated with ubiquinone-10 was inhibited by antimycin A to the same extent; PMS-induced and ascorbate-induced photosynthetic ATP formation were inhibited approximately 40% and 100%, respectively. Neither type of ATP formation was influenced appreciably by antimycin A, if reactivated by adding rhodoquinone alone. 5. From these findings, it was concluded that ubiquinone-10 is one of the essential components for photosynthetic ATP formation by intact chromatophores."

Slices of spleen, testis, intestine, and kidney also show increased incorporation following iron. The response of the liver to iron has been studied to determine whether increased transcription of genes and the formation of messenger RNA are involved, or whether control is at a later stage in the biosynthetic pathway. Three lines of evidence support the existence of transcriptional control. (a) Actinomycin D inhibits the response to iron.

If such a molecule is transected by sonic irradiation or proteolytic attack then any part of the molecule that retains the cross-links between the three chains remains reversibly renaturable and can be fractionated and identified by electron microscopy. In this way we show that the cross-links occur at both ends of the molecule. The carboxyl-terminal quarter (B end) was identified as the major site of cross-links in all materials examined, but it was deduced that a Z chain structure (wherein a cross-link between two chains occurs at each end to one common chain) is the predominant species present in acid-soluble tropocollagen. Relatively few cross-links between all three chains occur in the amino-terminal quarter of acid-soluble tropocollagen and these are vulnerable to pepsin digestion; the cross-links at both ends were labile to Pronase digestion. In enzyme-solubilized collagen obtained from insoluble collagen (representing a more mature collagen), new or stabilized cross-links were found in both end quarters. Those at the amino terminus are resistant to pepsin or trypsin digestion, while those at the carboxyl terminus are resistant to pepsin, trypsin, and Pronase digestion. The possible existence of a structural weakness vulnerable to shearing forces at a point 43% of the length of the molecule from the carboxyl terminus and a structural discontinuity susceptible to trypsin action one-quarter length from the same end have been noted. The occurrence of a component higher in molecular weight than tropocollagen has been shown, and its possible relationship to a fundamental packing unit in fibrogenesis has been indicated."

https://openalex.org/W2061583067,"THIN sections of keratin fibres can be “stained” by reaction with solutions of the salts of some heavy metals, notably silver and osmium. Electron microscopy shows a texture caused by the heavier staining of the matrix material surrounding the microfibrils. Such treatments also effectively enhance the small-angle equatorial X-ray diffraction, which has the character of the scattering from an assembly of roughly cylindrical holes (the microfibrils) in a continuous matrix of comparatively large electron density. It consists of peaks, E1, E2, E3, with equivalent Bragg spacings d1 = 80 A, d2 = 42 A, and d3 = 27 A, of which the first may be chiefly ascribed to inter-microfibrillar interference effects, and the other two to the first two diffraction fringes from a single microfibrillar hole1. The intensity ratio I2/I3 of E2 to E3 should in theory be approximately 4.2 : 1, and this agrees well with the observed value in the most studied case of silver staining2."
